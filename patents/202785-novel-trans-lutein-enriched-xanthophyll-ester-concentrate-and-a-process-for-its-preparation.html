				<td>Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to a novel trans-lutein enriched xanthophyll esters<br>
concentrate and a process for its preparation. The present invention, more particularly, provides a novel trans-lutein enriched xanthophyll esters concentrate, in which the xanthophyll esters comprise of 90-95% of trans-lutein esters , 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5 - 6% of zeaxanthin esters . The novel trans-lutein enriched xanthophyll esters concentrate of the present invention is useful for human consumption, either as nutraceuticals , nutritional supplements, as food additives and also for colouring feeds As nutraceuticals, the concentrate of the present invention has particular use as an agent for protecting against eye diseases due to aging , cataract and macular degeneration , for reducing the risk of developing certain diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases etc and as an antioxidant. The concentrate of the present invention has also better stability and bio-availability.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of the above said novel trans-lutein eruiched xanthophyll esters concentrate from oleoresin, especially from marigold oleoresin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Carotenoids are the most abundant kind of pigments widely distributed among plants and are considered to be non-toxic to human consumption. Xanthophyll esters belong to the group of these carotenoids. They are essentially di- or mono- fatty acid esters of the carotenoids consisting chiefly of di-palmitate, di-myristate, di-stearate as lutein and zeaxanthin. Zeaxanthin ester is a pigment contained in berries such as those of genus Lycium chinense (Chinese wolfberries) and Physalis. Lutein esters is the pigment that gives the yellow / red color to fruits such as oranges, peaches, papayas, mangoes, etc. Lutein esters are also present in many floral parts particularly marigold flowers of<br><br>
genus Tagetes. Xanthophyll esters are generally found in nature as trans- xanthophyll isomers and also in cis- isomeric form in trace amounts formed mainly due to adverse conditions of heat and light. Lutein esters of higher purity and naturally preserved trans-isomeric form are preferred for use in human requirements because of their better stability and bioavailability.<br>
The above carotenoids" being mainly fat-soluble has limited applications in foods. Dihydroxy carotenoids (xanthophylls), lutein and zeaxanthin are the compounds valued as poultry feed colourant and also a health nutritional supplement. Xanthophyll esters form the major colouring component in marigold flowers and its extracts.<br>
Marigold flower is the richest source of trar^- lutein esters found in nature. Dried and ground marigold flowers have been used commercially for more than three decades as pigmenting agent in poultry and animal feeds and as food coloring agent. Since many years it has been used as the starting material for the production of marigold extracts containing xanthophyll esters which is a commercially important ingredient. Reference in this context may be made to U.S. Patent no 3,539,686, (1970) and German patent no 1,224,597.<br>
Recently, these and other carotenoid esters both in mono-and di-ester forms have been reported to be naturally occurring in several fruits and vegetables (D.E.Breithaupt and A. Bamedi; Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry, Vol.49, 2064-2070, (2001); F.Khachik, G.R.Beecger and W.R. Lusby, Journal of Argi. Food Chemistry ,Vol 36,938-946,1988). Xanthophyll esters with higher amounts of trans-Iutein content have gained importance and preferred because of the natural occurrence in foods, better stability and bio-availability (Bowen and Clark, US patent no.6313169, November 2001; Herbst et al. FASEB Journal abstract No.ll, 2587, (1997); A. Subagio, H. Wakaki and N. Morita, Biosci.Biotechnol.Biochem., 63 (10), 1784-1786,1999. Further, the colouring power in the case of trans-Iutein (absorption maximum at 474nin) is superior to cis-lutein (absorption<br><br>
maximum at 468run)(W.L. Hadden, R.H. Watkins, L.W. Levy, E. Regalado, D.M. Rivadeneira, R.B, van Breemen and S.J. Schwartz of J. Agricultural Food Chemistry, Vol.47,4182-4194 (1999).<br>
The US Patent no 4,0482,03, (1977) (Phillip) describes a process for the extraction of lutein esters starting from marigold extract prepared by treating dried and ground marigold petals (1kg) with petroleum ether at room temperature. The extract was obtained by removal of the solvent under vacuum at 50 Deg C. The oleoresin (65 g) obtained thorough this process was dissolved in hot isopropanol at 75 Deg C and the solution filtered thorough a sintered glass funnel to remove un-dissolved materials. The filtrate was then cooled to 15 Deg C and the precipitated lutein fatty acid esters recovered by filtration through sintered glass funnel. The esters were dried under vacuum at 30 Deg C to yield 21 g lutein fatty acid esters with 51 % lutein esters content.<br>
In this patent there is no indication of the content of trans and / or cis- isomeric forms .It is our observation that due to high temperature of alkanol precipitation, considerable amount of trans-lutein esters is converted into cis-isomeric form, which is considered undesirable for use as human nutritional supplements. Further the tinctorial shade / hue of the cis- isomeric form is relatively poor.<br>
Tycozkowski and Hamilton (Poultry Science, 70, 651-654 (1991)) reported a process for the preparation of trans-lutein di-esters by reacting free lutein (Prepared from marigold oleoresin after saponification) with an acyl chloride. In this process saponified extract of marigold petals containing 14,70 mg lutein per gram was the starting material. To 1 g of the material was added with 10 ml solvent mixture HAET (hexane: acetone: toluene: absolute alcohol in the ratio 10:7:7:6 respectively). The mixture was stirred well followed by the addition of 10 ml of hexane and then 7 ml 10% aqueous sodium sulphate. After allowing to stand Ihour, the clear top layer was separated, condensed under nitrogen atmosphere to one-third its initial volume, and<br><br>
placed at 4 Deg C until crystals are formed. The crystals were filtered, washed with cold hexane, and dissolved in a minimal amount of warm hexane: acetone (80:20 v/v) for recrystallization. The final crystals were stored under nitrogen gas in the dark.<br>
Lutein di-esters were prepared by reaction of free lutein with acyl chloride. In an example, 20 mg of lutein was dissolved in 15 ml pyridine followed by the addition of 1 ml of palmitoyi chloride (99+%), and the mixture incubated at 50 Deg C for 2 hours. Later the reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel with the addition of 30 ml of HAET solution and hexane. The mixture was then washed tw^ice with equal volumes of 10% aqueous sodium sulphate(Na2S04) and twice with distilled water. After drying the upper layer with anhydrous sodium sulphate(Na2S04), the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen gas and lutein di-ester residue was stored under nitrogen gas in the dark at -20 Deg C.<br>
This synthesis-based method is not preferred because of the presence of associated impurities and non-availability of the naturally occurring lutein di-esters (xanthophyll esters). Therefore, the product resulting from the said method is not equivalent to the similar product produced or derived from natural source such as marigold flowers or<br>
its extracts<br>
Recently, Levy in the US Patent no 6,19,1293; (2001) described a method for the preparation of trans-xanthophyll ester concentrates having a trans-xanthophyll esters content at least 4 times greater and preferably at least nine times greater than the cis-xanthophyll esters content. The patent reports that xanthophyll esters concentrates having a total xanthophyll esters content of at least 40 % by weight and preferably greater than about 55 % by weight are obtained by the process disclosed therein<br>
The method of preparation comprises contacting plant material containing xanthophyll esters with a hydrocarbon solvent for a time sufficient to extract xanthophyll esters<br><br>
from the plant material, separating the hydrocarbon solvent and extract dissolved therein from the remaining plant material, evaporating the hydrocarbon solvent from the dissolved extract to obtain a crude xanthophyll ester concentrate, admixing the crude xanthophyll esters concentrate with an alcohol preferably isopropanol at approximately ambient temperature to dissolve non xanthophyll impurities and cis xanthophyll esters from the crude trans-xanthophylls concentrate to obtain the purified trans-xanthophyll esters concentrate .In a preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed in the above said US Patent, the plant material used is marigold flowers, preferably the corollas of the said flowers<br>
The method disclosed in the above Patent describes an example wherein one kilogram of dried marigold corollas (lutein esters content 2.90 % by wt) yielded 100 g of oleoresin by extraction with 8 litres of hexane. The oleoresin showed 27. 9 % lutein esters by weight and 75:25 trans-: cis-lutein isomer ratio (by HPLC peak heights). The oleorestn was stirred for three hours with 200 g isopropanol at 20 Deg C and after filtration and removal of solvent yielded 20 g of lutein esters concentrate with 69% lutein esters content(by spectrophotometric method) and trans-: cis-lutein isomer ratio 90:10(by HPLC method).<br>
In the above method, admixing the oleoresin with isopropanol at room temperature helps preferential dissolution of cis- isomers in isopropanol and thereby the lutein esters concentrate gets enriched with trans-lutein esters content with a trans-: cis- ratio 90:10. The method employs removal of isopropanol residue by applying vacuum at room temperature. Since isopropanol has a boiling point around 82.5 Deg C its removal to meet the health requirements involves long periods of time, causing time consuming and laborious.<br>
It is now well recognized that trans-xanthophyll esters containing higher amounts of trans-lutein content possesses better stability and bio-availability. Further, it also has<br><br>
higher coloring power (absorption maximum of trans-lutein esters at 474 run and cis-lutein esters at 468 run). Hence, currently there is a greater demand for xanthophyll esters concentrate having higher amounts of trans- isomer and consequently the commercial importance of such a product has gained importance globally. Therefore, we directed our research efforts towards development of a xanthophyll esters concentrate having higher amounts of trans- isomer and negligible or trace amount of cis- isomer, and a process for the preparation of such a concentrate.<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel xanthophyll esters concentrate having higher amounts of trans- isomer and negligible or trace amount of cis- isomer which is useful for human consumption, either as nutraceutical nutritional supplements, food additives and also for colouring foods and feeds which has better stability and bio availability.<br>
Another objecti\"e of the present invention is to provide a no\"el trans- xanthophyll ester concentrate comprising predominantly of a composition containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters wherein the composition contains 90-95% of trans-lutein esters, 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5 -6% of zeaxanthin esters which is useful for human consumption, either as nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, as food additives and also for colouring foods &amp; feeds and which has better stability and bio¬availability.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel trans xanthophyll esters concentrate comprising predominantly of a composition containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters wherein the composition contains 90-95% of trans-lutein esters, 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5-6% of zeaxanthin<br>
esters, which has better stability and bio-availability.<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process tor tne preparation of novel trans -xanthophyll esters concentrate comprising predominantly of a composition containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters wherein the composition contains 90-95% of trans-lutein esters, 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5-6% of zeaxanthin esters, which has better stability and bio-availability from oleoresin such as marigold oleoresin .<br>
The invention has been developed based on our finding that by preserving the natural<br>
trans-isomeric form in xanthophyll esters extract comprising of a composition containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters and by the selective removal of the cis-lutein esters and other undesirable impurities there from, a novel xanthophyll esters concentrate predominantly containing trans-lutein esters with negligible levels of the cis-lutein esters and devoid of the undesirable impurities can be obtained .<br>
We have found that by following the above method, a novel trans xanthophyll esters concentrate can be obtained, which contains lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters comprising of 90 - 95 % trans-lutein esters. Such a concentrate would have higher pigmenting properties and greater bio-availability of trans-lutein esters. Consequently, the new concentrate would be very much useful as neutraceuticals such as those explained earlier , as human nutritional supplements and as colouring agent for food and animal feeds.<br>
With the above objective in mind we studied in depth the effectiveness of dissolving specific solutes in specific solvents. Generally, the effectiveness of dissolving specific solutes in specific solvents is governed by the parameters like polarity of the solute, solubility parameter ot the solvent, temperature, pressure, solute to solvent ratio, mixing time, etc. We observed that when the aliphatic ketonic solvents such as 2-propanone 2-butanone and 2-pentanone or their mixtures are mixed with extracts containing xanthophyll esters, comprising of a composition containing lutein and<br><br>
zeaxanthin fatty acid esters, there is a preferential dissolution of cis- isomeric lutein esters and the impurities such as triglycerides, waxes etc, in the said solvent, resulting in a concentrate enriched with trans-lutein esters.<br>
It can be seen from the literature 0 A Riddick et al.. Organic Solvents Tech Organic Chemistry, VoU II, 5^1^ Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1986) that the aliphatic ketones like 2-propanone, 2~ butanone, 2-pentanone and their mixtures have solubility parameter values around 10 which is in between the solubility parameter values of non-polar solvents [like hexane is around 7] and polar solvents [like methanol around 14.5] The reason for the unique preferential and selective solubility of the cis- isomer and the impurities in the above said ketonic solvents may be due to the above said characteristics of the solvents .and also the unsymmetrical nature of cis- isomer and / or due the synergistic effects of the above said phenomena. The selection of the above mentioned ketonic solvents, among the wide range of ketonic solvents is based on critical factors like safety and health regulations, ease of handling, low boiling point commercial consideratiot« and more importantly the above said functional property of selectivity. It is also to be mentioned here that the use of such ketonic solvents have not hitherto been used for the selective dissolution of the cis- isomers.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel xanthophyll esters concentrate, which is useful for human consumption, either as nutraceuticals or as food additives and also for colouring foods and animal feeds and which has better stability and bio availability comprising predominantly of a composition containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters wherein the composition contains 90-95% of trans-lutein esters, 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5 -6% of zeaxanthin esters<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of the above defined xanthophyll esters concentrate which<br>
compris<br><br>
(a)	Admixing an extract or oleoresin containing xanthophyll esters containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters with an aliphatic ketonic solvent selected from 2-propanone, 2-butanone and 2- pentanone or their mixtures at a temperature in the range of 10 to 30 degree C under stirring to selectively solubilize the non-xanthophyll ester impurities and the cis-lutein esters and lipids present therein and simultaneously enriching   in the resulting mixture the trans-lutein esters content.<br>
(b)	Filtering the resulting mixture to obtain trans-lutein eiuiched xanthophyll esters concentrate in a solid form and<br>
(c)	Drying the concentrate under vacuum at room temperature and<br>
(e) preserving the concentrate at a temperature below 20 deg C in an inert atmosphere and in airtight opaque containers to prevent the degradation of the concentrate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the weight-to-volume ratio of extract or oleoresin containing xanthophyll esters from plant source to the ketonic solvent used ranges from 1: 3 to 1: 15 . The preferred extract or oleoresin containing xanthophyll esters containing lutein and zeaxanthin fatty acid esters used is marigold oleoresin<br>
The temperature employed for admixing the extract with the ketonic solvent may preferably be in Hm nin^tcH^ the range of 15-30 Deg C.<br>
The period of agitation in step (a) may be for a period ranging from 2 to 12 hours, preferably around 10 hours .<br><br>
The resultant concentrate has to be preserved suitably at low temperature namely below 20 deg C in an inert atmosphere and in airtight opaque containers to prevent the degradation of the concentrate.<br>
The trans-lutein enriched xanthophyll esters concentrate of the present invention can be converted, if desired, into products like beadlets, capsules , pellets, ointments , soft gelatin capsules, tablets ,    chewable tablets , lotions    / liquid preparations, etc by<br>
conventional methods.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The commercially produced food grade marigold oleoresin using hexane as extractant can be used as the starting material for the process of the present invention .As explained earlier marigold flower (Tagetes erecta) is known to be the rich source for obtaining xanthophyll esters and its derivatives and particularly for trans-lutein esters. In the recent years the cultivation of marigold flowers has increased largely producing quality marigold flowers in many parts of south India. There are many commercial manufacturers producing marigold oleoresin containing around 20-25% xanthophyll esters.<br>
Commercially procured / processed marigold oleoresin containing trans-lutein and_cis-lutein content as 66% and 25% respectively is admixed with a ketorxic solvent like 2-propanone, 2-butanone or their mixtures, preferably 2-propanone under stirring at controlled temperature in the range of 15 - 30" C, preferably 25oC, so as to remove the impurities and as well as to precipitate the trans-lutein esters enriched xanthophyll esters, followed by filtration and washing with the same solvent. The material is dried at ambient temperature, under vacuum to obtain a concentrate containing 90-95% of trans-lutein esters, 0-5% of cis-lutein esters and 3.5-6% of zeaxanthin esters<br><br>
We have also observed that the resulting enriched trans-lutein concentrate has improved visual appearance v/hich is confirmed by higher L*, a*, b* values measured on a Hunter Colorimeter<br>
By the process according to the present invention we could prepare a concentrate having trans-: cis- lutein isomer ratio of at least 18:1, and xanthophyll ester content 60-80% by wt. in the concentrate as compared to the reported corresponding values ranging from 4:1 to 9:1 and 41 to 69 % by weight respectively. (Levy US patent no 6,191,293, (2001). We could also prepare trans-xanthophyll esters concentrate with the total elimination of cis- isomer.<br>
The details of the invention are given in the examples given below which are provided solely to illustrate the invention only and therefore should not be construed to<br>
limit the scope of the present invention<br>
In this context it is to be noted that there are no established or recommended procedures for direct analysis of total xanthophyll ester content and its isomeric composition such as trans- and cis - in a given sample. This difficulty is due to the fact that the ester concentrate is a mixture of several fatty acids esters of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are not easily separated in HPLC. Further, pure or reference standards of these esters are not available from reputed chemical suppliers.<br>
Therefore the most widely adopted methodology consists of initial hydrolysis of the ester concentrate and measuring the colour of an aliquot of the solution at 474 run using a spectrophotometer and expressing the same as xanthophyll content. From this value, xanthophyll ester content is calculated by multiplying by a factor of 2.<br><br>
Later an aliquot of the above sample solution is analyzed by normal phase HPLC to obtain percentage area of trans &amp; cis isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin. The percentage area of each of the isomers corresponds to percentage composition of its ester form in the concentrate.<br>
In the following examples we have used the above method for measuring xanthophyll ester content, cis- &amp; trans- lutein esters content. We have also taken into account the relative percentage area between the trans &amp; cis- isomers by HPLC method described above for calculating the trans- to cis- lutein ratio while defining the novel concentrate<br>
of the present invention<br>
Example 1<br>
A weighed quantity of marigold oleoresin (180g) with xanthophyll ester content 21.80% by weight and showing trans-lutein, cis-lutein and zeaxanthin area percentage by HPLC 64.24, 23.46 and 4,16 respectively was trarisferred into an Erleruneyer flask (1000 ml) followed by the addition of 720 ml of 2-propanone. This was stirred using a thermostatically controlled stirrer at 15-25 Degrees Celsius for a period of 5-10 hours. After an interval of every 2 hours sample was drawn, filtered and the dried precipitated material was analyzed for the ester content and trans-: cis- ratio by HPLC. Finally when the desired degree of the purity had been achieved the solution containing precipitate was filtered thorough a Buchner funnel and the precipitate was dried in vacuum drier at ambient temperature.<br>
The yield of the resulting concentrate was 18.19 g (Yield 10.10 %) and the analysis showed xanthophyll ester content 64.02% by weight, assayed by spectrophotometric method, measuring at 474 nm. This xanthophyll ester concentrate showed by area percentage by HPLC, 90.38 trans-lutein , 3.85 cis- lutein and 4.43  zeaxanthin   . On<br><br>
visual examination, this concentrate showed an improved orange red color as compared to the starting material, which was dark brown in color.<br>
Example   2.<br>
157 g of commercial grade marigold oleoresin containing 21.38% xanthophyll ester content by weight, and containing trans-lutein, cis-lutein and zeaxanthin area percentage by HPLC 65.59, 24.61 and 5.08 respectively was mixed with 540 ml of 2-propanone and transferred into an Erlenmeyer flask and stirred for a period of 10 hours at 15-25 Deg C. After an interval of every 2 hours a sample was drawn, filtered and the dried precipitated material was analyzed for the ester content and trans-: cis-ratio by HPLC. Finally when the desired degree of the purity had been achieved the solution containing precipitate was filtered through a Buchner funnel and the precipitate was dried in vacuum drier at ambient temperature.<br>
The yield of the resultant concentrate was found to be 17.2 g (Yield 10.95 %) with xanthophyll esters content at 62.60% by weight, assayed by spectrophotometric method, measuring at 474 nm. This xanthophyll ester concentrate showed by HPLC analysis 92 .20 trans-lutein , 2.33 cis-lutein and 4.40 area percentage of zeaxanthin . On visual examination, this concentrate showed an improved orange red color as compared to the starting material, which was dark brown in color.<br>
Example 3<br>
The experiment was performed using 180 grams of commercial grade marigold oleoresin containing 22.12% by weight xanthophyll esters content with trans-lutein, cis-<br><br>
lutein and zeaxanthin area percentage by HPLC 67.05, 22.98 and 4.50 respectively. To this was added 720 ml of 2-propanone and transferred into an Erlenmeyer flask . Then mixture was stirred for a period of 10 hours at 15 Degrees Celsius. The precipitated cake was filtered and again subjected to further purification by the addition of 350 ml of -^ 2-propanone and continuing the stirring for a period of 2-3 hourss and maintaining at a temperature around 25 Deg C. Finally the concentrate obtained after filtration and drying was found to be 17,40 g ( Yield 9.67%) The xanthophyll ester content was 70.58%, tissayed by spectrophotometric method, measuring at 474 run. This xanthophyll ester concentrate showed area percentage trans-lutein 92.47, cis-lutein 2.32 and zeaxanthin 4.31 by HPLC analysis . On visual examination, this concentrate showed an improved orange red color as compared to the starting material which was dark brown in color.<br>
Example -4.<br>
100 g of marigold oieoresin obtained from commercial scale production batch having xanthophyll esters content 23.10% by weight and containing area % by HPLC of trans-lutein 67.23, cis-lutein 22.08 and zeaxanthin 5.18 was taken.
