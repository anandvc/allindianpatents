ION LOAD AND	GRANTED AID AGENT FOR THE SAME<br>
APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : OMYA AG<br>
b)	Nationality : SWISS Company<br>
c)	Address     : BASLERSTRASSE 42,<br>
CH-4665 OFTRINGEN, SWITZERLAND<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
  WEAKLY IONIC AQUEOUS SUSPENSIONS OF GROUND-MINERAL MATTER AND THEIR USES<br>
The present invention relates to the technical sector of suspensions of mineral matter and their applications in the fields of paper, paint and plastics, and more particularly their applications in the paper industry with a view to improving either the paper sheet manufacturing process, or the sheet treatment process, or the sheet properties.<br>
The invention firstly concerns aqueous suspensions or "slurries" of refined mineral matter, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, that are weakly ionic and have a low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time, that is to say it relates to aqueous suspensions of refined mineral matter, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, with a low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, as determined by ionic titration, is low.<br>
These aqueous suspensions are intended for pigmentary applications in the field of paper, paint and plastics and are used more particularly for paper applications such as paper coating and/or surface treatment of the paper, or such as the filler during the manufacture of the paper, board, or analogous sheets.<br>
This use as filler can be direct as composition of filler during manufacture of the paper, board, or analogous sheets, or indirect as recycling composition of coating brokes when the recycling compositions of coating brakes are used in the manufacture of the paper, board, or analogous sheets.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a weakly ionic and water-soluble copolymer as a grinding aid agent for grinding mineral matter in aqueous suspension in order to obtain aqueous suspensions or "slurries' of said refined matter, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, with a low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time, and having the properly that it presents a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, as determined by ionic titration, is low.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of same copolymer as dispersion agent of the filter cake obtained during an intermediate stage in the manufacture of refined mineral matter suspensions, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, with low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, as determined by ionic titration, is low, this intermediate stage taking place after grinding and before thermal reconcentration.<br>
The invention also relates to said grinding aid agent by means of which it is possible to obtain aqueous suspensions of said refined mineral matter, with a dry matter concentration that can be high, with low Brookfield™ viscosity that remains stable over time and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, as determined by ionic titration, is low.<br>
The present invention moreover relates to the grinding process that implements said grinding aid agent.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to the use of said aqueous suspensions of mineral matter before or after drying or re-dispersion after drying in the field of paper or paint, and after drying in the field of plastics, and more particularly in the field of paper for paper industry applications such as, in particular, paper coating and/or the surface treatment of paper, or such as the filler, whether the latter implements a direct composition of filler or a recycling composition of coating brokes.<br>
It also relates to the use of said aqueous suspensions of mineral matter in a drying process after grinding.<br>
Finally, it relates to paper, board or analogous products manufactured and/or coated according to the invention.<br>
In the manufacturing process of a sheet of paper, board or analogous product, the skilled man in the art increasingly tends to replace part of the expensive cellulose fibres by cheaper mineral matter in order to reduce the cost of the paper while improving its properties.<br>
This mineral matter, familiar to the skilled man in the art, comprises, for example, calcium carbonate and miscellaneous analogous fillers such as dolomite, gypsum, calcium hydroxide, satin white, titanium dioxide or mixed carbonate based fillers of various metals such as, in particular, calcium associated with magnesium and analogues, various matter such as talc or analogues, and mixtures of these fillers, such as, for example talc-calcium carbonate or calcium carbonate-kaolin mixtures, or mixtures of natural calcium carbonate with aluminium hydroxide, mica or with synthetic or natural fibres or co-structures of minerals such as talc-calcium carbonate or talc-titanium dioxide co-structures.<br>
For a long time now it has been quite common to use, as grinding aid agents, water-soluble polymers based on polyacrytic acid or its derivatives (FR 2 488 814, FR 2 603 042, EP 0 100 947, EP 0 100 948, EP 0 129 329, EP 0 542 643, EP 0 642 644) to provide aqueous mineral suspensions that meet the above-mentioned refinement and viscosity criteria, but these grinding aid agents are polymers and/or copolymers of the anionic type which have the disadvantage of requiring the addition of cationic compounds during the paper sheet manufacturing process when the aqueous mineral suspensions containing them are implemented in these sheet manufacturing operations.<br>
The end user therefore strives to minimise the polymer agent demand during paper manufacture, for every median diameter and/or for every point of the grain size curve of the particles of mineral matter implemented.<br>
To solve the problem, the skilled man in the art is currently familiar with the solution recommended in patent application FR 2 810 261, which has the disadvantage of not fully meeting the end user's needs because although this solution makes it possible to obtain aqueous suspensions of mineral matter with low ionic charge, it does not make it possible to have suspensions with a sufficiently low ionic charge to correspond to the end user's needs.<br>
2<br><br>
Moreover, the paper manufacturer who is the end user is faced with the problem of implementing coating colours which are not sufficiently stable during paper coating operations.<br>
The skilled man in the art, being familiar with this problem, also seeks to develop aqueous suspensions of mineral matter which make it possible to obtain coating colours which are highly stable even at low anionicity and for every median diameter and/or for every point of the grain size curve of the particles of mineral matter implemented.<br>
Faced with the above-mentioned problems, the Applicant took the surprising step of developing aqueous suspensions of refined minerals with dry matter concentration that can be high, with low Brookfieid™ that remains stable over time, and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, determined by ionic titration, is very low, suspensions the implementation of which, both in the paper manufacturing processes and in the filler or in the paper sheet treatment processes such as coating, make it possible to solve the above-mentioned problems.<br>
These aqueous suspensions of refined minerals with dry matter concentration that can be high, with low Brookfieid™ that remains stable over time, and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, determined by ionic titration, is low, are obtained by using a weakly charged polymer as a grinding agent of the mineral matter in aqueous suspension, or by using the same copolymer as dispersing agent of the filter cake obtained in an intermediary stage of the manufacture of the suspension, this intermediary stage taking place after grinding and possibly before a physical concentration process such as thermal concentration.<br>
The said aqueous suspensions of refined mineral matter with dry matter concentration that can be high, with low Brookfieid™ that remains stable over time, and having a pigmentary surface area the ionic charge of which, determined by ionic titration, is low, are characterized in that they contain, as a grinding aid agent, a copolymer consisting of:<br>

and in that said copolymer has an intrinsic viscosity less than or equal to 100 ml/g determined in accordance with the above-mentioned method.<br><br>
The copolymer used according to the invention is obtained by known radical copolymerization processes in solution, in direct or inverse emulsion, in suspension or precipitation in appropriate solvents, in the presence of known catalytic systems and transfer agents, or by means of controlled radical polymerization processes such as the method known as Reversible Addition Fragmentation Transfer (RAFT), the method known as Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP), the method known as Nitroxide Mediated Polymerization (NMP), or the method known as Cobaloxime Mediated Free Radical Polymerization.<br>
This copolymer obtained in acid form and possibly distilled can also be fully or partially neutralized using one or more neutralizing agents having a monovalent neutralizing function or a polyvalent neutralizing function such as, for example, for the monovalent function those selected from the group consisting of the alkaline cations, in particular sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium or the primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic and/or cyclic amines such as for example stearylamine, the ethanolamines (mono-, di-, triethanolamine), mono and diethylamine, cyclohexylamine, methylcyclohexylamine, aminomethylpropanol, morpholine or, for the polyvalent function those selected from the group consisting of alkaline-earth divalent cations, in particular magnesium and calcium, or zinc, and of the trivalent cations, including in particular aluminium, or of certain cations of higher valency.<br>
Each neutralizing agent then operates according to neutralization rates proper to each valency function. According to another variant, the copolymer obtained from the copolymerization reaction may, before or after the total or partial neutralization reaction, be treated and separated into several phases, according to statistical or dynamic processes known to the skilled man in the art, by one or more polar solvents belonging to the group consisting of water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanols, acetone, tetrahydrofurane or mixtures thereof.<br>
One of the phases then corresponds to the copolymer used according to the invention as dispersing agent or grinding aid agent of mineral matter in aqueous suspension.<br>
The invention also relates to said weakly ionic and water-soluble grinding aid agent of mineral substances in aqueous suspension having the property of being weakly charged. Said agent is characterized in that it is the above-described copolymer.<br>
The invention also relates to the grinding process that implements said grinding aid agent of mineral substances in aqueous suspension.<br>
In practice, according to the invention, grinding the mineral substance consists in refining said substance into very fine particles using a grinding body in an aqueous environment by means of the copolymer used as a grinding aid agent.<br>
A variant consists in forming, by introducing the total quantity of the copolymer, an aqueous suspension of the mineral substance to be ground, the particles of which have an initial dimension equal to no more than 50 micrometres.<br>
To the suspension of the mineral substance to be ground thus formed is added the grinding body of a grain size preferably between 0.20 millimetres and 4 millimetres. The grinding body is generally presented in the form of particles of materials as diverse as silicium oxide, aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide or mixtures thereof together with synthetic resins of great hardness, steels or others.<br>
The grinding body is preferably added to the suspension in a quantity such that the ratio by weight between this material and the mineral substance to be ground is at least 2/1, this ratio preferably being between the limits 3/1 and 5/1.<br>
The mixture of the suspension and the grinding body is then subjected to mechanical grinding action, such as that which occurs in a classical microelement grinder.<br>
The quantity of grinding aid agent introduced varies from 0.05% to 10% by dry weight of said copolymers with respect to the dry mass of the mineral substance to be refined.<br>
The time necessary to obtain a highly refined mineral substance after grinding varies according to the nature and quantity of the mineral substances to be refined and according to the stirring mode used and the temperature of the medium during the grinding operation.<br>
Another variant consists in using a part of the grinding aid agent before the grinding stage and implementing the rest of the quantity of the grinding agent during the grinding operation.<br>
Finally, another variant consists in not implementing the copolymer before the grinding stage and using the entire quantity necessary during the grinding operation, which takes place in one or more stages.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, the grinding process in aqueous suspension intended for pigmentary applications consisting in refining into very fine particles an aqueous suspension of said mineral materials is characterized in that use is made, as a grinding aid agent, of 0.05% to 10% by dry weight of the above-mentioned polymers with respect to the dry weight of mineral materials before and/or during the grinding stage.<br>
Another mode of implementing the invention also consists in implementing, in addition to said copolymer used as a grinding agent, at least one other grinding agent before and/or during the grinding stage.<br><br>
Thus, according to a variant, the grinding process according to the invention is characterized in that use is made, as a grinding aid agent, of 0.05% to 10% by dry weight of the above-mentioned polymers with respect to the dry weight of mineral materials and at least one other dispersant or grinding aid agent before and/or during the grinding stage.<br>
Said other dispersant or grinding aid agent is then selected from those other dispersants or grinding aid agents familiar to the skilled man in the art such as, in particular, homopolymers or copolymers of acrylic acid in their acid forms, or fully or partially neutralized by one or more neutralizing agents, said neutralizing agents being selected from the same list as that referred to above, or is selected from among the dispersants or grinding aid agents such as, in particular, H3O* ion donors of which phosphoric acid and/or its salts with mono and/or divalent bases such as soda or lime are particularly worthy of mention.<br>
Particularly, the grinding process according to the invention is characterized in that use is made of 005% to 1.0%, by dry weight with respect to the dry weight of mineral substances, of said other dispersant or grinding aid agent.<br>
The temperature during the course of the grinding stage and for all the variants of the grinding process according to the invention lies between 15°C and 150°C, preferably between 50°C and 105°C and especially preferably between 60°C and 98°C.<br>
For mineral matter containing carbonate, the pH during the course of the grinding stage and for all the variants of the grinding process according to the invention lies between 6 and 13, preferably between 7.5 and 12 and especially preferably Between 8 and 10.<br>
For mineral matter not containing carbonate, the pH during the course of the grinding stage and for all the variants of the grinding process according to the invention lies between 2 and 13, preferably between 7.5 and 12 and especially preferably between 8 and 10.<br>
When implementing these various grinding variants, apart from the problem that it resolves, the invention has the advantage that less foam is produced during grinding when using the copolymers than when using the polymers of the prior art. Another advantage of the invention consists in the fact that the aqueous suspensions of mineral matter refined according to the invention always have grains of mineral matter having, for an equivalent grain size, a specific surface area less than the grains of mineral matter of the aqueous suspensions of mineral matter refined according to the prior art by implementing polyacrylate. This advantage is perceptible when the end user uses latex in coating formulations.<br>
Thus the aqueous suspensions of mineral matter according to the invention are characterized in that the grains of mineral matter have, for an equivalent grain size, a BET specific surface area less than the grains of mineral matter of the aqueous suspensions of mineral matter refined using grinding aid agents such as polyacrylates, homopolymers or copolymers well known to the skilled man in the art.<br>
The mineral substances to be refined according to the process of the invention can be of highly diverse origin such as calcium carbonate, dolomites, kaolins, calcine kaolins, talc, gypsum, titanium oxide, or aluminium trihydroxide or any other filler and/or pigment that has to be ground in order to be used in applications such as the manufacture of papers, board or analogues and are preferably calcium carbonate such as natural calcium carbonate selected from among marble, calcite, chalk or mixtures thereof.<br>
The papers manufactured according to the invention are characterized in that they contain said aqueous suspensions of fillers and/or pigments according to the invention.<br>
The scope and interest of the invention will be better perceived thanks to the following examples, which are not of a comprehensive nature.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example illustrates, by comparison with comparable grain size, how to reduce the cationic polymer demand in the mass by implementing an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate containing the copolymer used, according to the invention, as a grinding aid agent.<br>

suspension that results from the grinding and the grinding body.<br>

One hour after grinding is completed, a sample of the pigmentary suspension, the grain size of which (% of particles less than 2 micrometres) is measured using a Sedigraph™ 5100 particle size analyzer, is recovered in a beaker.<br>

This example illustrates the link between filler retention in filling and cationic polymer demand.<br>
Test No. 23<br>
This test illustrates the prior art and implements 0.27% by dry weight, with respect to the dry weight of calcium carbonate, of<br>
a sodium and magnesium polyacrylate of intrinsic viscosity equal to 7.8 ml/g according to the above-mentioned intrinsic<br>
viscosity method, to obtain, from a calcium carbonate with a median diameter of 15 urn, an aqueous suspension of ground<br>
calcium carbonate having a dry matter concentration equal to 65.5% by weight and having a grain size such that 61% by<br>
weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 2 pm and 30% by weight of the particles have a diameter of less than 1<br>
pm measured on the Sedigraph™ 5100 corresponding to a median diameter equal to 1.63 urn.<br>
The dry matter concentration (S.C: Solid Content) and Brookfield™ viscosity results obtained with the same measuring<br>
method as test No. 1 are as follows:<br>
S.C. = 65.5%<br>
Viscosity (To) = 115 mPa.s<br>
AVAG viscosity (Trdays) = 620 mPa.s<br>
APAG viscosity (TVdays)= 155 mPa.s<br>
Filler retention in the filling is determined using the method described below and simulating prevalent conditions for a sheet of paper of a grammage equal to 80 g/m2 and charged to 20% by weight.<br><br>
The filler retention value then corresponds to the equation<br>
Filler retention = Turb. of incoming body - Turb. wire water x 100 Turb. of incoming body<br>
where Turb. = turbidity<br>
Turb. of incoming body = Turb. of fibre-filler mixture - Turb. of fibre<br>
To do this, it is therefore necessary to measure, on the one hand, the turbidity of the fibre-filter mixture and, on the other<br>
hand, the turbidity of the fibre alone and the turbidity of the water of the fabric.<br>
This latter is measured directly by reading the value of the turbidity indicated by the Nephelometer 155 from Defensor AG<br>
(Switzerland) in NTU (Nephelo Turbidity Unit) units,<br>
On the other hand, to determine the turbidity of the fibre-filler mixture, a fibre-filler mixture is made from a masterbateh formed by diluting 4 parts of fibres consisting of 80% birch and 20% pine in 10 litres of water. 18.2 dry grams of the fibre masterbateh and 9.8 grams of the dry filler to be tested are added to a device known as a distributor (Rapid-Kothen) and topped up with 5 litres of water. After 15 minutes of stirring and the addition of the quantities indicated in table 1 below, of a retaining agent of the polyacrylamide type marketed under the name Praestof™ PK 422, by Stockhausen, Krefeld, Germany, a mixture that simulates the prevalent conditions for a sheet of paper of grammage equal to 80 g/m2 and charged to 20% by weight is obtained.<br>
The mixture thus formed is dried in a vacuum of 0.2 bar for over 2 seconds.<br>
The values, at 700 rpm, of filler retentions in the filling, obtained by means of the above equation and as a function of the cationic retaining agent rate of the polyacrylamide type marketed under the name Praestof™ PK 422, by Stockhausen (Germany) are shown in table 1 below.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
This example illustrates, via measurement of the gloss and by comparison at identical grain size, the stability of the coating colour obtained by implementing an aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate according to the invention. To do this in each of the tests of the example, it is necessary to prepare a coating colour with 68% concentration of dry matter, consisting of:<br>

Once the coating colour is prepared in this manner, its Brookfield™ viscosity is measured using a model DV-II+ Brookfield™ viscometer fitted with the corresponding spindle.<br>
The coating colour prepared is then applied to a wood based paper 53 u.m thick and with a grammage equal to 82, using a Combiblades pilot coater from Jagenberg GmbH fitted with a 0.457 mm thick blade.<br>
A long dwell time application head is used with a blade angle of 45°. The coating speed is 1000 m/s and the average coating deposited is 11 g/m2 on each surface of the paper.<br>
