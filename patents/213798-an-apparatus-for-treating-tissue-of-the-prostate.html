METHOD FOR ADMINISTERING THERMOTHERAPY<br>
TO PREVENT THE GROWTH OF TUMORS<br>
	Related Applications<br>
5 		This application claims priority to US Patent Application No. 10/247,747,<br>
	filed September 20, 2002, which is a contimiation-in-part of U,S. Patent<br>
	Application No. 09/597,234, filed June 20, 2000,<br>
	Background of thc Invention<br>
		1, Field of the Invention<br>
10 		The present invention generally relates to a system for administering<br>
	focused energy to a body selectively using either a single energy applicator or<br>
	multiple microwave applicators in order to treat visable tumors and microscopic<br>
	malignant and benign cells in prostate tissue with hyperthennia. The system<br>
	according to the invention may be used to treat healthy tissue containing<br>
15 	undetected microscopic pathologically altered cells (neoplasia) that are of high-<br>
	water content to prevent the occurrence of or the recurrence of cancerous, pre-<br>
	cancerous or benign prostatic lesions. In addition, the disclosed system and<br>
	method for using the system can prevent the growth of tumors inside the prostate,<br>
	as well as prevent the spread of cancer cells outside the prostate.<br>
20 		2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
		In order to treat prostate tumors with, hyperthermia, it is necessary to heat a<br>
	significant portion of the prostate gland while sparing healthy tissues in the<br>
	prostate as well as the surrounding tissues including the urethral and rectal walls<br>
	of a patient. In the United States there arc approximately 200,000 cases of detected<br>
25 	prostate cancer annually as well as 375,000 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia,<br>
	known as BPH, (enlarged prostate gland). BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement<br>
	(tumor) of the prostate gland that occurs in almost all men as they age, particularly<br>
	past the age of 50 years. In the case of BPH, the enlargement of the prostate<br>
	involves the excessive growth of tissue that eventually obstructs the bladder outlet,<br>
30	 creating difficulties with urination. In the case of prostate cancer, eventually the<br>
	cancer will break through the prostate gland capsule leading to the spread of<br>
	cancer to the bones and vital organs of the body. Although some of the signs of<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT7US2003/028898<br><br>
	BPH and prostate cancer are the same, having BPH does not increase the chances<br>
	of getting prostate cancer. Nevertheless, a patient who has BPH may have<br>
	undetected prostate cancer at the same time or may develop prostate cancer in the<br>
	future.<br>
5 		As is known in the art, the use of heat to treat prostate tumors can be<br>
	effective in a number of ways; however, in most cases, the heat treatment must be<br>
	capable of heating a significant volume of the prostate gland without overheating<br>
	the urethral and rectal walls. In radiation therapy, the entire prostate and adjacent<br>
	tissues are inadiated with x-rays to kill all the microscopic cancer cells. While<br>
10 	heating large volumes of the prostate can destroy many or all of the microscopic<br>
	carcinoma cells in the prostate, known methods of heating tumors can destroy<br>
	healthy tissue in the prostate and, more damaging, in the urethral and rectal walls<br>
	of a patient.<br>
	The prostate gland has electrical properties similar to muscle (T.S. England<br>
15	 and N.A. Sharples, Nature, Vol. 163, March 26,1949, pp. 487-488,) and is known<br>
	to have a high-water content, on the order of 80% (FA. Duck, Physical Properties<br>
	of Tissue, A Comprehensive Reference Book, Academic Press, New York, p. 321,<br>
	1990). Tumor tissue, in general, tends to be 10 to 20% higher in water content<br>
	than normal tissue (Foster and Schepps, Journal of Microwave Power, vol. 16,<br>
20	 number 2, pp. 107-119, 1991). Thus, prostate tumors may have a water content on<br>
	the order of about 90%. Accordingly, selective microwave heating of the prostate<br>
	would be the best method of targeting cancerous or benign cells.<br>
	It is well known that microwave energy can heat high-water content tumor<br>
	tissues faster when compared to the heating that occurs in lower-water content<br>
25 	normal tissues. Tumor tissue tends to be poorly perfused so blood flow often<br>
	decreases at therapeutic temperatures allowing rapid heating, while in normal<br>
	tissues the blood flow often increases protecting the normal healthy tissue from<br>
	heat damage. Many clinical studies have established that hyperthermia (elevated<br>
	temperature) induced by electromagnetic energy absorption in the microwave<br>
30 	band, significantly enhances the effect of radiation therapy in the treatment of<br>
	malignant tumors in the human body (Valdagni, et al., International Journal of<br>
	Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 28, pp. 163-169, 1993; Overgaard et<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br>
	al., International Journal of Hyperthermia, Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 3-20,1996; Vernon<br>
	et al., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 35, pp.<br>
	731-744,1996), Radio-resistant cells such as S-phase cells can be killed directly<br>
	by elevated temperature (Hall, Radiobiology for the Radiologist, 4th Edition, JB<br>
5 	Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, pp. 262-263, 1994; Perez and Brady,<br>
	Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology, Second Edition JB Lippincott<br>
	Company, Philadelphia, pp. 396-397, 1994). Hyperthermia treatments with<br>
	microwave radiating devices are usually administered in several treatment<br>
	sessions, in which the malignant tumor is heated to about 43° C for about 60<br>
10	 minutes. It is known that the amount of time to kill tumor cells decreases by a<br>
	factor of two for each degree increase in temperature above about 430 C (Sapareto,<br>
	et al., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 10, pp.<br>
	787-800, 1984). Thus, a 60-minute heat-alone treatment at 43° C can be reduced<br>
	to only about 15 minutes at 45° C, which is often referred to as an equivalent dose<br>
15 	(t43°C equivalent minutes).<br>
		During treatments with noninvasive microwave applicators, it has proven<br>
	difficult to heat semi-deep tumors adequately while preventing surrounding<br>
	superficial healthy tissues from incurring pain or damage due to undesired hot<br>
	spots. The specific absorption rate (SAR) in tissue is a common parameter used to<br>
20 	characterize the heating of tissue. The SAR is proportional to the rise in<br>
	temperature over a given time interval times the specific heat of the tissue, and for<br>
	microwave energy the SAR is also proportional to the electric field squared times<br>
	the tissue electrical conductivity. The units of absolute SAR are waits per<br>
	kilogram.<br>
25 		The first published report describing a non-adaptive phased array for deep<br>
	tissue hyperthermia was a theoretical study (von Hippel, et at., Massachusetts<br>
	Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Insulation Research, Technical Report 13,<br>
	AD-769 843, pp. 16-19, 1973). U.S. Patent No. 3,895,639 to Rodler describes<br>
t	wo-channel and four-channel non-adaptive phased array hyperthermia circuits.<br>
30	 Likewise, a non-adaptive phased array hypothermia system was disclosedinU.S.<br>
	Patent No. 4,589,423 to Turner.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
		Bassen et al., Radio Science, Vol. 12, No. 6(5), Nov-Dec 1977, pp, 15-25,<br>
	shows that an electric-field probe can be used to measure the electric-field pattern<br>
	in tissue, and in particular, shows several examples in which the measured<br>
5 	electric-field has a focal peak in the central tissue. This paper also discusses a<br>
	concept for real-time measurements of the electric field in living specimens.<br>
	However, Bassen et al. did not develop the concept of measuring an electric field<br>
	using real-time with an electric-probe to adaptively focus a phased array.<br>
	The most difficult aspect of implementing hyperthermia in deep prostatic<br>
10	 tissues, with microwave energy, is producing sufficient heating at a predetermined<br>
	depth while protecting the urethral and rectal walls and surrounding organs from<br>
	bums. Noninvasive multiple applicator adaptive microwave phased arrays with<br>
	invasive and noninvasive electric field probes can be used for producing an<br>
	adaptively focused beam at the tumor position with adaptive nulls formed in<br>
15 	healthy tissues as described in U.S. Pat Nos. 5,251,645, 5,441,532,5,540,737, and<br>
	5,810,888 to Fenn, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Ideally, a<br>
	focused microwave radiation beam ia concentrated at the tumor with minimal<br>
	energy delivered to sunounding healthy tissue. To control the microwave power<br>
	during treatment, a temperature-sensing feedback probe (Samaras et al.,<br>
20 	Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium, Essen, Germany, June 2-4,1977,<br>
	Urban &amp; Schwarzenberg, Baltimore, 1978, pp. 131-133) is inserted into the tumor,<br>
	however, it is often difficult to accurately place the probe in the tumor. An<br>
	additional difficulty occurs in delivering hyperthermia to carcinoma spread<br>
	throughout the prostate gland, because of a lack of a well-defined target position<br>
25 	for the temperature-sensing feedback probe. In otter situations, it is desirable<br>
	simply to avoid inserting probes (either temperature or E-field) into the prostate<br>
	tissue in order to reduce the risk of infection or spreading the cancer cells when<br>
	the probe passes through the tumor region.<br>
Several articles have been written on the use of dual intracavitary<br>
30	 (transurethral and transrectal) coherent phased array microwave applicators for<br>
	prostate cancer treatment (A. Surowiec, et al, Hyperfhermic Oncology 1992, Vol.<br>

	International Congress on Hyperthermic Oncology, Rome, Italy, April 9-13,1996,<br>
	pp. 598-600). Further, US. Patent No, 5,007,437 to Sterzer describes the use of<br>
	non-coherent transurethral and transrectal applicators for BPH treatments.<br>
	However, the known prior art is directed to the use of transurethral and transrectal<br>
10 	applicators for treating solid, tumor masses. None of the known procedures are<br>
	concerned with treating microscopic disease and preventing the occurrence of<br>
	solid tumor masses such mat occur in cancer and BPH,<br>
	Prostate Cancer<br>
		The current standard of medical care for treating prostate cancer includes<br>
15 	radical or nerve-sparing prostatectomy in which, the entire prostate gland is<br>
	surgically removed, and brachytherapy in which radiation seeds at low dose are<br>
	permanently implanted in the prostate gland radiating effectively for 6 to 9 months<br>
	or radiation seeds at high dose are temporarily implanted in the prostate for about<br>
	2 days, combined with external-beam radiation therapy to catch microscopic<br>
20 	cancer cells that may have penetrated or could penetrate the prostate capsule. Side<br>
	effects from surgery include incontinence and impotence. The cancer recurrence<br>
	rate after surgery can be as high as approximately 35% at 5 years, and<br>
	approximately 60% at 10 years, particularly when the prostatic-specific antigen<br>
	level (discussed below) is greater than 10. Radiation therapy has short-term side<br>
25	 effects such as skin reactions, fatigue and nausea. Additional long-term side<br>
	effects of radiation therapy to the prostate include urinary incontinence (loss of<br>
	bladder control) and impotence, as well as damage to surrounding organs.<br>
	Hormone therapy is also used to supplement prostate cancer treatments by<br>
	stopping cancer cells from growing. Male hormones, such as testosterone, help<br>
30 	cancer cells grow and, in contrast, female hormones or estrogens inhibit growth.<br>
	Side effects of estrogen therapy include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, fluid<br>
	retention, weight gain, headaches and gynccomastia (an increase in breast tissue)<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
in men.<br>
		Fundamentally, the problem with current prostate treatments is the<br>
	inability to control microscopic capsule penetration from the prostate gland, which<br>
	spreads the cancer to vital organs. Men with microscopic capsule penetration of<br>
5	 cancer cells are not cured by radical prostatectomy. These microscopic cells may<br>
	spread far from the prostate gland into vital organs by means of the lymphatic<br>
	system or by blood vessels through the prostate capsule.<br>
	It is possible to detect the presence of prostate cancer by means of the well-<br>
	known serum assay Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test (M.K. Brawer, "Prostate-<br>
10 	Specific Antigen: Current Status," CA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians Vol. 49,<br>
	pp. 264-281, 1999, and J.E Oesterling, "Prostate Specific Antigen: A Critical<br>
	Assessment of the Most Useful Tumor Marker for Adenocarcinoma of the<br>
	Prostate," The Journal of Urology, Vol. 145, pp. 907-923, May 1991.). The<br>
	prostatic lumen contains the highest concentration of PSA in the human body.<br>
15 	PSA is an enzyme produced in all types of prostatic tissue (normal, benign<br>
	hyperplastic and malignant). In particular, PSA is a serins protease that is<br>
	produced only by the epithelial cells lining the acini and ducts of the prostate<br>
	gland; none of the other cellular components of the prostate, including the stromal<br>
	and vascular elements produce PSA Researchers have verified that PSA is<br>
20 	produced in the epithelial cells of BPH tissue, primary prostate cancer tissue, and<br>
	metastatic prostate cancer tissue. The serum PSA test detects a significant number<br>
	of prostate cancers and the destruction of prostatic tumors leads to reduced PSA<br>
	levels, since the body stops producing PSA when the tumors are eliminated.<br>
	Currently, a PSA level of 4.0 ng/ml or greater is used to decide whether a patient<br>
25 	will be biopsied to try to verify the presence of carcinoma in the prostate. Thus,<br>
	patients with a PSA level under 4.0 ng/ml currently are not biopsied even if they<br>
	experience the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer which may include: frequent<br>
	urination, especially at night, inability to urinate, trouble starting or holding back<br>
	urination, a weak or interrupted urine flow and frequent pain or stiffness in the<br>
30 	lower back, hips or upper thighs.<br>
	In addition to PSA level, the Gleason Grade is used to histologically grade<br>
	adenocarcinoma of the prostate (G.k. Zagars, et at, International Journal of<br>
-6-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 237-245, 1995), with<br>
	Grade 1 being the least malignant and slowest growing. Gleason Grade 3 is the<br>
	most commonly occurring grade when diagnosed. Gleason Grades 4, 5 and above<br>
	(up to 10) are considered highly aggressive, rapidly growing carcinomas.<br>
5	 Biopsy results and staging are used to predict the behavior of the cancer<br>
	and the likelihood of its spread. Stage 1 tumors are small and cannot be felt on<br>
	rectal examination. Stage 2 or greater refers to prostates in which the tumor can<br>
	be felt. Stage 3 cancers have spread beyond the boarders of the prostate, In Stage<br>
	4, which can be determined by imaging studies such as bone scans, CT, or MRI<br>
10 	scans, the cancer has spread into nearby lymph glands, the bones, or elsewhere in<br>
	the body. As is well known in the medical field, the earlier the cancer is detected,<br>
	the better the chance of being a cancer survivor. If detection is not possible before<br>
	stage 2, the next best medical option would be to safely treat apparently healthy<br>
	tissue. Thus, there is a need to treat healthy tissue since cancer, in general, cannot<br>
15 	be detected until it has reached stage 2 or a later stage.<br>
	There are four types of prostate ductal carcinomas: transitional cell<br>
	carcinoma, intraductal adenocarcinoma, mixed ductal carcinoma, and<br>
	endometrioid carcinoma. Transitional cell and mixed ductal carcinomas are<br>
	aggressive cancers that require complete removal of the prostate and bladder if<br>
20	 found while the tumor is still confined to the prostate. Complete removal of the<br>
	prostate and bladder is also the medically accepted treatment for endometrioid<br>
	carcinoma. Intraductal adenocarcinomas are treated by radical prostatectomy.<br>
	Thus, there is a need for a system for treating and preventing the growth and<br>
	spread of cancer that does not require surgical prostatectomy.<br>
25 	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia<br>
	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is described primarily as an<br>
	enlargement of the prostate gland that exerts pressure on the urethra, resulting in<br>
	obstruction of the flow of urine, and is a common affliction in middle-aged and<br>
	older males. Approximately 50% of men older than 65 years will have BPH<br>
30	 symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. The American Urological<br>
	Association (AUA) Symptom Index was developed to help categorize BPH<br>
	symptoms. The AUA score has the following score ranges: 0 to 7 points - BPH<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2004/026093	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	symptoms are considered mild; 8 to 19 points - BPH symptoms are considered<br>
	moderate; and 20 to 35 points - BPH symptoms are considered severe. However,<br>
	many BPH patients do not seek treatment until their AUA score is about 12.<br>
		Over the last two decades, a number of treatments for BPH have been<br>
5 	developed each with advantages and disadvantages. The major types of BPH<br>
	treatment systems are; 1) transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), 2)<br>
	Transurethral Electrovaporization of the Prostate (TVP), 3) Drugs, 4) Interstitial<br>
	Laser Coagulation, 5) RF Needle Ablation, and 6) Microwave Thermotherapy of<br>
	the Prostate. Other treatment techniques have been explored, including<br>
10 	transurethral incision of the prostate, prostatic stents, and balloon dilation, but are<br>
	used to a lesser extent,<br>
		BPH treatment success and practicality can measured in terms of 1)<br>
	efficacy, 2) durability, 3) level of pain (during and after the procedute), 4)<br>
	recovery period, 5) complexity of the procedure, 6) cost of the procedure, and 7)<br>
15	 side effects. Efficacy of BPH treatments is commonly quantified using the AUA<br>
	Symptom Index (SI) and peak urine flow rate. Normal urine flow rate is about 16<br>
	ml/sec. Other optional tests such as residual urine volume and pressure flow are<br>
	sometimes used to judge efficacy. Durability is the length of time for which the<br>
	treatment is effective. The level of pain relates primarily to the need for either<br>
20	 general anesthesia or local anesthesia. The recovery period is measured in terms<br>
	of the number of days of hospitalization and home rest. The complexity of the<br>
	procedure is a function of the length of the procedure, the training of the<br>
	individual administering the procedure (either an urologist or a technician), the<br>
	type of anesthesia, required, and the length of time needed for Foley catheterization<br>
25 	after treatment. The cost of the procedure is influenced strongly by the length and<br>
	complexity of the procedure - particularly whether a hospital stay is required.<br>
		Until about 1990, the major treatment ("Gold Standard") for BPH was<br>
	Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) which is administered by<br>
	urologists. TURP is expensive, requires a long recovery time, and has a number<br>
30 	of significant side effects, which has prompted the search for better treatment<br>
	techniques. A summary of approaches to treat BPH, including surgery, drug and<br>
	laser, RF, and microwave applications is described below.<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP):<br>
		The "Gold Standard" of BPH treatments involves a surgical procedure in<br>
	which a rigid transurethral scope with an electrosurgical loop is used to remove<br>
	part of the enlarged prostate tissue (primarily the central zone of the prostate) with<br>
5 	RF energy, In practice, 90% of surgical procedures for BPH involve TURP, due<br>
	to its excellent efficacy (85% or more), long-term durability (10 to 15 years) for<br>
	90% of patients. On the order of 200,000 TURPs are performed in the United<br>
	States annually. TURP has a number of drawbacks: It is a very painful procedure<br>
	and requires both 2-4 days of hospitalizaaon and 2-4 weeks of recovery at home.<br>
10 	The TURP procedure is performed in about one hour and requires general<br>
	anesthesia. An urologist must perform the procedure. A Foley catheter is required<br>
	for about 2-3 days post treatment. some of the major potential side effects of a<br>
	TURP include impotence, incontinence, high blood loss, and retrograde<br>
	ejaculation.<br>
15 	Open Prostatectomy:<br>
		An open, prostatectomy is primarily used on patients with very large<br>
	prostates with excellent results: the efficacy is greater than 95% and the durability<br>
	is the same as TURP (10 to 15 years), With any surgical procedure, the pain level<br>
	is very high and general anesthesia is required. About 7 to 10 days of<br>
20 	hospitalization is required with an additional 3-5 weeks spent at home. The<br>
	procedure takes a few hours and must be performed by a urologist. Following the<br>
	treatment, a Foley catheter must be used for 2-4 days to drain the bladder. An<br>
	open prostatectomy is about twice the cost of a TURP, and has the serious<br>
	potential side effects and complications including high blood loss, impotence, and<br>
25 	incontinence,<br>
Transurethral Electrovaporization_of the_Prostate (TVP):<br>
		Basically a modification of TURP, transurethral electro vaporization of the<br>
	prostate employs a grooved electrosurgical rollerball electrode to channel open the<br>
	urethra that is blocked by the prostate tissue. The TVP procedure is safer and has<br>
30 	minimal side effects compared to TURP, The efficacy is excellent (85%), but still<br>
	is a very painful procedure requiring 2-4 days of hospitalization and 1-2 weeks at<br>
	home, A urologist performs this 60-minute procedure and the patient is under a<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
general anesthetic. A Foley catheter must be used for 2-4 days following this<br>
	procedure. The procedure costs slightly less than TURP. There is less blood loss<br>
	than with TURP, but their are still the potential side effects of impotence,<br>
incontinence, and retrograde ejaculation.<br>
5 	Transurethral Incision of the Prostate (TUIP):<br>
		In a relatively new procedure for patients with small prostates,<br>
	transurethral incision of the prostate provides an efficacy of about 80%. However,<br>
	TUIP is not effective on large prostates, A minimal amount of prostate tissue is<br>
	removed in this procedure - a simple incision is made along the entire length of<br>
10 	the prostate. The TUIP procedure allows the bladder neck to spring open,<br>
	allowing free urinary flow. The durability is expected to be similar to TURP, but<br>
	clinical research is still in progress. This procedure is moderately painful and<br>
	requires only a day or two of hospitalization, or for some patients is an outpatient<br>
	procedure. Usually, 4 to 7 days of home rest are needed following the procedure.<br>
15 	A urologist must perform this 60-mimite surgical procedure and a Foley catheter<br>
	must be used for 2 to 4 days. The cost of the TUIP is about the same as TURP.<br>
	There is less blood loss with this procedure compared to TURP, but there are still<br>
	the potential side effects of impotence, incontinence, and retrograde ejaculation.<br>
	Balloon Dilation:<br>
20 		For patients with small prostates, balloon dilation within the prostatic<br>
	urethra can be used to offer some relief from BPH symptoms. The efficacy is only<br>
	about 60% and the durability is only 1 to 5 years. This procedure is less costly<br>
	than TURP and is usually performed as an outpatient with several days of home<br>
	rest The procedure is performed under local anesthesia by a urologist in about 30<br>
25	 minutes. A Foley catheter is required for about 2-4 days. There may be some<br>
	bleeding in this procedure and there are the possible side effects of infection and<br>
	impotence. The procedure does not work well on large prostates.<br>
Stents:<br>
		For very ill patients with small prostates, stents can be used with good<br>
30 	effectiveness to improve BPH symptoms. Durability is not a major issue since<br>
	these patients are usually very ill with other diseases. This procedure is moderately<br>
	painful and requires only local anesthesia, is performed in about 30-minutes by a<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/208898<br><br>
	urologist, and is done as an outpatient with about 4-5 days of home rest. The cost<br>
	of this procedure is less costly than TURP. Some of the potential side effects are<br>
	irritation, infection, and the formation of debris on the stent.<br>
	Drugs:<br>
5 		Two categories of drugs are used in treating BPH, One category uses an<br>
	alpha blocker (Hytrin or Cardura) to relax the muscles that surround the prostate to<br>
	allow better urinary flow, The other type of drug is reductase inhibitor (Proscar)<br>
	which actually shrinks the prostate gland.<br>
	Hytrin, for example, has very good efficacy (74%) and offers some immediate<br>
10 	relief of BPH symptoms, however 2-3 weeks are needed until the full<br>
	effectiveness is reached. Clinical data suggests that this drug has at least 3 to 5<br>
	years durability and is simply prescribed by a general practitioner. The cost is less<br>
	than TURP depending on the number of years of treatment. There can be some<br>
	serious side effects such as dizziness, chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and shortness<br>
15 	of breath.<br>
		Proscar worts well on large prostates, but is ineffective on small prostates.<br>
	Full effectiveness of the drug takes about 3 to 6 months and the durability is<br>
	estimated at least 3 to 5 years. This drug is prescribed by a general practitioner<br>
	and must be taken for at least 12 months. The cost of the drug is less than TURP.<br>
20 	Some of the known side effects are impotence, swollen lips, decreased volume of<br>
	ejaculate, and skin rash.<br>
	Interstitial Laser Coagulation:<br>
		Here, an interstitial laser coagulation surgical device delivers laser energy<br>
	radially along the length of a custom-designed light diffuser. The diffuser<br>
25 	produces an ellipsoidal pattern of thermal damage, applying the laser energy<br>
omnidirectionally and uniformly, to maximize treated tissue volume in the<br>
	prostate. This is a moderately painful surgical procedure, requiring one or two<br>
	days in the hospital and then 1 to 2 weeks al home. This 30-minute procedure<br>
	must be performed by a urologist, with a choice of either general or local<br>
30 	anesthesia depending on the patient's condition. A serious disadvantage with this<br>
	procedure is the lengthy required time of 1 to 2 weeks in which a Foley catheter<br>
	must be used to drain the bladder of urine. The cost of the procedure is less than<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	TURP. There are many potential side effects from this treatment including<br>
	impotence, incontinence, blood loss, and retrograde ejaculation.<br>
	RF Needle Ablation (TransurethraJ Needle Ablation):<br>
		This system uses two high-energy RF (approximately 0,47 MHz) needles<br>
5 	that are inserted through the urethra into the prostate, to ablate the prostate tissue<br>
	in a few minutes. More than 10,000 patients worldwide have been treated with this<br>
	system, which provides good to very good efficacy. There is only limited 12-<br>
	month durability data for this system, so the long-term effectiveness is not known.<br>
	The procedure is moderately painful (local anesthesia required) and is performed<br>
10 	as an outpatient with 1-2 weeks for home recovery. The procedure is usually<br>
	per formed by a urologist in about 30 minutes- About 40% of patients will require a<br>
	Foley catheter for about 2 to 3 days. The procedure costs less than TURP. The<br>
	major side effects from this procedure are irritating voiding, erectile dysfunction,<br>
	and retrograde ejaculation.<br>
15 	In view of the known treatments for BPH, which require costly, painful,<br>
	surgery or drugs which have potentially dangerous side effects, there is a need for<br>
	a system of treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that is not painful; can be<br>
	accomplished on an outpatient basis; and quickly restores the patient to his normal<br>
	functions. In addition, a method is needed that can safely treat the prosteate gland<br>
20 	with focussed energy before a significant amount of microscopic tumor cells form<br>
	in the prostate <br>
	Summary of the Invention<br>
		The above problems associated with known treatments are solved by the<br>
	system and method for using the system according to the invention. The system<br>
25 	and method according to the invention safely heat pre-cancerous, cancerous, pre-<br>
	benign, and benign conditions of the prostate by heating the prostate gland with<br>
	focussed or concentrated energy, such as microwave energy, delivered by either<br>
	phase non-coherent or coherent array applicators in the urethra and rectum, or with<br>
	interstitial applicators positioned within the prostate. In a non-coherent array,<br>
30	 separate microwave oscillators can drive the applicators and there is no common<br>
	phase relation. In a phase coherent array (phased array), a single microwave<br>
	oscillator can drive multiple applicators with, a common phase relation.<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
		The Applicants' approach is to treat the prostate gland with focussed<br>
	energy, such as microwave energy before a significant amount of microscopic<br>
	tumor cells form in the prostate gland. As described above, all past uses of<br>
	thermal therapy were used for the treatment of established prostate cancers with<br>
5	 moderate to high PSA levels (over 4.0 ng/ml) or for the treatment of moderate to<br>
	severe AUA symptom index scores for BPH. The preferred embodiment of this<br>
	invention is for the prevention or before detection, or before medical intervention<br>
	is required. Thus, the inventive method is for treating prostate cancer when the<br>
	PSA level is less than 4.0 ng/ml, or for treating BPH whete BPH symptoms are<br>
10 	less than severe or the AUA symptom index score is less than 13. In other words,<br>
	the inventive method is to prevent the cancer or BPH from developing into a<br>
	significant problem for a patient (i.e., before serious adverse effects occur).<br>
	The preferred method of treating a prostate, according to the invention, is<br>
	with a coherent adaptive phased array and comprises the steps of monitoring<br>
15	 temperatures of walls of the urethra and rectum, orienting two microwave<br>
	applicators in at least one of the urethra and rectum, adjusting the microwave<br>
	power to be delivered to the prostate based on the monitored urethral and rectal<br>
	wall temperatures, monitoring the microwave energy dose delivered to the prostate<br>
	being treated and automatically completing the treatment when a desired total<br>
20 	microwave energy dose has been delivered by the microwave applicators.<br>
	Incoherent-array or non-adaptive phased array hyperthermia treatment<br>
	systems can be used to heat semi-deep and deep tissue, depending on the radiating<br>
	frequency. Due to the dielectric heating of high-water content tissue such as<br>
	prostate tumor, it may be possible to safely heat prostate tumors with cither non-<br>
25	 coherent arrays or non-adaptive phased arrays.<br>
	Moreover, the system and method according to the invention have<br>
	application in situations where there is no well-defined position to place the<br>
	temperature feedback sensor, or where it is desirable to avoid inserting a<br>
	temperature probe into the prostate tissue. In the case of a single applicator, an E-<br>
30	 field probe (or E- field sensors) is not necessary and thus, an invasive probe is not<br>
	required in the preferred system and method according to the invention. The<br>
	inventive system and method may destroy all of the prostate pre-cancerous and<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	cancerous cells or benign lesions with heat generated by the focussed energy<br>
	thereby avoiding further progression of the cancer cells or benign lesions.<br>
		In addition the method according to the invention can he used to enhance<br>
	radiation therapy or for targeted drug delivery and/or targeted gene therapy<br>
5	 delivery with or without thermosensitive liposomes as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
	5,810,888 to Fenn.<br>
		The method according to the invention destroys the pre-cancerous,<br>
	cancerous, pre-benign, and benign cells in the prostate while preserving normal<br>
	prostate tissue. Thus, the system and method according to the invention achieves<br>
10 	a thermal prostatectomy and avoids damage to healthy tissue; Accordingly, the<br>
	inventive method is a prostate conservation technique.<br>
	The urethral and rectal wall temperature can be measured by temperature<br>
	probe sensors positioned away from the transurethral and transrectal applicators to<br>
	obtain the true temperature of the urethral and rectal walls. Alternatively, the<br>
	15 tissue temperatures can be monitored by external means, including infrared, laser,<br>
ultrasound, electrical impedance tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and<br>
	radiometry techniques as known in the art.<br>
		Alternatively, a temperature probe could be inserted at an appropriate<br>
	depth in the prostate tissue to monitor the temperature thereof. As discussed<br>
20	 below, insertion of a temperature probe is not a preferred embodiment.<br>
	in an embodiment with two or more energy applicators, an invasive E-field<br>
	probe, inserted in the prostate, may or may not be used to measure the microwave<br>
	power delivered to the tissue to be treated to determine the length of the focussed<br>
	energy treatment in a preferred embodiment, the invasive E-field probe can be<br>
25	 used to focus the applied energy at the E-field probe inserted in the prostate.<br>
	As an alternate embodiment, for a coherent phased array, two E-field<br>
	sensors can be placed in the prostatic urethra and rectum non-invasively and be<br>
	used to null the E-field in the urethra and rectum and effectively focus the<br>
	microwave radiation in the prostate tissue. Additionally, the microwave phase for<br>
30	 the transurethral and transrectal applicators can be adjusted so that the microwave<br>
	energy is scanned across an area of the prostate,<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	The system and method according to the invention can be achieved with or<br>
	without compression of the prostate. In a preferred method, a patient's prostate<br>
	would be compressed by expanding at least one of a urethral balloon and a rectal<br>
	balloon, Focussed energy and prostate compression provide preferential heating<br>
5 	of high-water content prostate carcinoma and benign cells in the prostate<br>
	compared to the surrounding lower-water content normal prostate tissues and.<br>
	tissue surrounding the prostate.<br>
		To coherently focus the energy, such as microwave energy, in the prostate,<br>
	the patient's prostate can be compressed via a urethral and rectal balloon and<br>
10	 means for determining where to focus the energy in the patient's prostate is used.<br>
	The means for determining where to focus the energy can be either a single<br>
	electric-field probe, inserted in the central portion of the prostate, or two<br>
	noninvasive electric-field sensors on the urethral and rectal walls. The probe or<br>
	sensors receive signals that can be used to measure a feedback signal in order to<br>
15 	adjust the energy phase delivered to the applicators located in the urethra and in<br>
	the rectum.<br>
		In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the step of<br>
	compressing the prostate may be maintained following the completion of the<br>
	microwave-induced heating step. That is, the compression of the prostate is<br>
20	 maintained for a period of time following the microwave-induced heating step to<br>
	reduce prostate blood flow and to accumulate additional equivalent thermal dose.<br>
	The prostate compression can be achieved by maintaining the inflated pressure of<br>
	balloon catheters in at least one of the urethral and rectal areas. Periodic prostate<br>
	compression to reduce prostate blood flow may be employed .in accumulating<br>
25	 chemotherapy, thermosensitive liposome-encapsulated chemotherapy, or gene<br>
	therapy in the prostate region during thermotherapy.<br>
		The major advantages offered by treatment according to the system and<br>
	method of the invention over known treatments are listed below:<br>
		1. Prevention and destruction of prostate tumors (including cancerous and<br>
30	0 benign);<br>
		2. Immediate relief from any BPH symptoms that might exist;<br>
		3. Long term durability;<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098<br>
PCT/US2003/028898<br>
4. Only low level pain may be experienced;<br>
5. Outpatient procedure;<br>
6. Local anesthesia;<br>
7, No Foley catheter required; and<br>
5 	8. No significant side effects or complications.<br>
	A biological stent can be formed in the prostatic urethra due to the<br>
	combination of compression balloon dilation, and microwave heat (microwave<br>
	urethroplasty) as evidenced in clinical tests held by the assignee, Celsion<br>
	Corporation, during 1999. As a result, one of the major deficiencies in known<br>
10 	BFH treatments, namely the need for a Foley catheter for several days, is no longer<br>
	needed and a patient may experience immediate relief from BPH symptoms.<br>
As described below, applicants' inventive system and method involves<br>
	monitoring the microwave energy dose delivered to the prostate being treated and<br>
	completing the treatment based on. the total microwave energy dose that has been<br>
15 	received. That is, conventional temperature feedback measurements of tumor<br>
	thermal dose can be replaced with the total microwave energy delivered to the<br>
	coherent phased array or non-coherent microwave applicators and then to the<br>
	treated area. Accordingly, with the instant invention, instead of temperature<br>
	feedback measurements, which require the insertion of a temperature feedback<br>
20 	probe into the prostate and its inherent problems, microwave energy dose is used<br>
	as a feedback to determine the required length of treatment. In this application the<br>
	term "microwave energy dose" (in Joules or watt-seconds) is similar to the dose<br>
	used in radiation therapy, namely the radiation absorbed dose<br>
	(Rad) which is a unit of absorbed dose of radiation defined as deposition of 100<br>
25	 ergs of energy per gram of tissue.<br>
	Thus, the instant method for selectively heating cancerous and benign<br>
	conditions of the prostate avoids the risk of spreading cancer cells since the<br>
	temperature probe is not inserted into the treated area (tumor bed) of the prostate.<br>
	The elimination of an inserted temperature probe reduces the risk of infection to a<br>
30 	patient as a result of the inserted probe. Likewise, the microwave field applied to<br>
	a tumor would not be subjected to scattering or other disturbance caused by a<br>
-16-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	temperature probe, especially a metallic probe- In addition, the time and costs<br>
	associated with inserting the temperature probe are saved.<br>
		The inventive system and method may also be used to treat healthy<br>
	prostate tissue or undetected high-water content microscopic pre-cancerous or pre-<br>
5 	benign cells in seemingly healthy prostate tissue to present the occurrence of or<br>
	recurrence of cancerous conditions of the prostate. Thus, the system and method<br>
	according to the invention would be able to destroy or ablate'microscopic<br>
	precancerous or pre-benign cells in the prostate gland that are higher in water<br>
	content (e.g., 90%) than the prostate gland (e.g., 80%) before they are detected.<br>
10 	This would be an early treatment that could prevent cancer from growing in the<br>
	prostate and spreading from the prostate, or enlargement of the prostate gland. In<br>
	the case of seemingly healthy tissue, the prostate tissue would be irradiated with<br>
	microwave energy focused at high-water content microscopic cells that are known<br>
	to form lesions without damaging the healthy lower-water content prostate tissue.<br>
15 		If both transurethral and transrectal applicators are used and both are<br>
	expanded by respective balloons, a preferred system having means for<br>
	compressing and immobilizing the prostate to reduce the tissue penetration depth<br>
	and to reduce the prostate blood flow is achieved.<br>
	In an alternate method, the prostate is compressed with a single<br>
20 	transurethral balloon, which immobilizes the prostate tissue, reduces blood flow,<br>
	and reduces the penetration depth required for the microwave radiation. The<br>
	compression balloon is made of a microwave transparent plastic material such as<br>
	Latex. The placement of an E-field feedback probe in the prostate may be<br>
	achieved with an ultrasound transducer or other type of image guidance. Further<br>
25	 reduction in blood flow can be achieved, in a preferred method, by injecting a<br>
	local anaesthetic lidocaine with ephinephrine or anti-angiogenesis drug in the<br>
	prostate.<br>
	Two microwave applicators (such as described by U.S. Pat. No; 5,007,437<br>
	to Sterzer which is incorporated herein by reference) can be positioned<br>
30	 transurethrally and transrectally. A phased array can be achieved with a multiple<br>
	number of applicators greater man or equal to two. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
	coherent 915 MHz microwave power is delivered to the two traosurethral and<br>
-17-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	transrectal applicators, at a predetermined power level, whiie phase shifters in<br>
	each, channel are adjusted to maximize and focus the microwave energy at the E-<br>
	field probe sensor. Water-cooling within the catheters and balloons allows cooling<br>
	of the urethral and. rectal walls. Additional interstitial applicators can. be inserted<br>
5 	within the prostate to supplement the beating that is produced by the transurethral<br>
	and transrectal applicators.<br>
	During the hyperthermia treatment, the microwave power level delivered<br>
	to each of the applicators may be adjusted either manually or automatically to<br>
	avoid high temperatures that could, cause bums or blisters to the urethral or rectal<br>
10	 walls. In addition, the amount of prostate compression, if used, is adjusted as<br>
	necessary during treatment to provide patient comfort. Each time the prostate<br>
	compression is adjusted, the microwave-energy/phasod array is refceused so that<br>
	the E-field probe sensor receives maximum power. The total microwave energy,<br>
	since the start of the treatment, delivered to the microwave applicators is<br>
15 	monitored during the treatment. The treatment is completed when a desired<br>
	amount of total microwave energy is delivered to the microwave applicators,<br>
	which indicates that the lesion cells are significantly destroyed (i.e., thermal<br>
	downsizing) or completely destroyed (i.e., thermal prostatectomy).<br>
	In order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment, the prostate tissue<br>
20	 may be imaged and examined with one of x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic<br>
	resonance imaging before and after the microwave total energy dose is<br>
	administered, as well as with pathological results from needle biopsy of the<br>
	prostate tissues.<br>
	In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the single invasive E-ficld<br>
25 	probe is replaced with two E-field sensors positioned in the urethra and rectum<br>
	and the coherent array is phase focused by minimizing (nulling) the individual or<br>
	combined power received by the two sensors, providing a completely noninvasive<br>
	treatment. In a preferred embodiment, the two E-field sensors are contained with<br>
	catheters attached to the outside surface of a compression balloon which provides<br>
30	 a pressure contact to the uretbal and rectal walls. Algorithms are used in<br>
	conjunction with the feedback signals sensed by the E-field sensors to null areas<br>
	on the urethral and rectal walls outside thereby focussing the applied energy on an<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US20O3/028898<br><br>
	internal site. After the nulling algorithm is completed, the E-field sensors can be<br>
	withdrawn and temperature sensors can be inserted to measure the urethal and<br>
	rectal wall temperatures.<br>
		Such a totally non-invasive hyperthermia treatment where E-field sensors<br>
5 	and temperature sensors monitor the urethral and rectal walls would provide an<br>
	effective method of destroying benign and cancerous lesions in the prostate. In an<br>
	embodiment with non-coherent applicators, an E-fleld focussing probe and phase<br>
	shifters are not required to heat the tissue. With, non-coherent energy, only the<br>
	applicator radiated power is additive and phase shift is not used.<br>
10 	While the preferred embodiment is described with reference to adaptive<br>
	microwave phased array technology, Applicants' system and method may be<br>
	achieved by focussing energy, in general, to heat and ablate an area of tissue. The<br>
	focused energy may include electromagnetic waves, ultrasound waves or waves at<br>
	radio frequency. That is, applicants' inventive system and method includes any<br>
15 	energy that can be focused to heat and ablate an area of tissue. This energy, such<br>
	as microwave or ultrasound energy, can be coherent or non-coherent. In another<br>
	embodiment, the energy may come from a fluid or a laser applicator.<br>
	In yet another embodiment of the invention with a coherent phased array,<br>
	the boundary of an area of tissue to be treated in a body (e.g., prostate) is<br>
20	 calculated, an E-field probe may be inserted in the body or at least two E-field<br>
	sensors are positioned within the urethra and rectum; and energy is applied<br>
	through applicators to the area to be treated. In this embodiment, the focus of the<br>
	energy would change so that the focus scans the area to be treated. That is, there is<br>
	no longer a fixed focus spot as the relative phase of the applied energy would be<br>
25	 adjusted so that the focus moves inside the area to be treated thereby obtaining a<br>
	geometric shape of heating.<br>
	A fixed focus spot is determined through the appropriate algorithm. Then,<br>
	for example, the relative phase of the applicators to obtain this fixed focus spot is<br>
	adjusted 30° one way (positive) and then 30° the other way (negative) to "scan" a<br>
30 	larger heated/treated area. Depending on the size of the area to be treated the scan<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Description of the Prostate Gland and its Microwave Properties<br>
20		 The prostate gland 220 is part of the male reproductive system and is a<br>
	solid, walnut-shaped organ that surrounds the first part of the urethra 205<br>
	immediately under the bladder 202 and in front of the rectum 210. Prostate cancer<br>
	arises from the glands of the prostate and the most common form of prostate<br>
	cancer is known as adenocarcinoma, which means a cancer of the glands. Most<br>
25	 prostate cancers develop within the bottom portion of the prostate (sometimes<br>
	referred to as the peripheral zone which involves roughly 70% of the glandular<br>
	prostate) closest to the rectum, and this is the region that needs a significant<br>
	amount of treatment. While a digital rectal exam is useful in detecting hardened<br>
	areas or lumps in the prostate gland, however it is not very useful for detecting<br>
30	 microscopic prostate disease. The use of a transrectal applicator (in addition to a<br>
	transurethral applicator) to reach this portion of the prostate is essential for a<br>
	complete treatment of the prostate. The central zone of the prostate (closest to the<br>
-20-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	bladder) is relatively immune to both BPH and prostate cancer diseases. BPH<br>
	arises mainly in the transition zone located between the central zone and<br>
	peripheral zone.<br>
		As discussed above, current medical procedure does not biopsy a tumor<br>
5 	until a PSA of 4.0 ng/ml is reached. The data shown in Table 1 indicate that there<br>
	is only about a 15% probability of detecting cancer by needle biopsy when the<br>
	PSA is less than 4 ng/ml- Although the probability of detecting the cancer is very<br>
	low, the actual probability that there are microscopic cancer cells in the prostate is<br>
	significant (25% or more) (F.H. Schröder et al, The Journal of Urology, Vol. 163,<br>
10	 No. 3, p. 806 (abstract), March 2000) (Eschenbach et al., CA' Cancer J. Clinicians,<br>
	Vol, 47, pp. 261-264, 1997). Thus, thormotherapy treatment of the prostate<br>
PSA Level	Probability of Detecting Prostate CancelInitial Biopsy<br>
2 ng/ml	1%<br>
2-4 ng/ml	15%<br>
4-10 ng/ml	25%<br>
&gt; 10 ng/ml	&gt;50%<br>
Table 1, Probability of detecting cancer cm initial biopsy for different levels of<br>
PSA.<br>
15	 is likely warranted, even if the PSA level is in the range of 0 to 4 ng/ml.<br>
	Thermotherapy treatment of the prostate for PSA levels below 4 ng/ml is intended<br>
	to kill the microscopic cancer cells in the prostate and keep the PSA from rising<br>
	above 4 ng/ml<br>
		Microwave radiation in the Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM) band 902<br>
20 	to 928 MHz is commonly used in commercial clinical hyperthermia systems, and<br>
	is the primary frequency band considered here. It is known that the proitate is<br>
	high-water content tissue and, hence, is similar to muscle tissue which is well<br>
	characterized. For normal prostate tissue at 915 MHz, the average dielectric<br>
	constant is 50 and the average conductivity is 1.3 S/m. The calculated loss due to<br>
25 	attenuation of a 915 MHz plane wave propagating through prostate tissue is<br>
-21-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	approximately 3 dB per cm. Prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, also known as<br>
	atypical hyperplasia and intraductal dysplasia are pre-cancers and are associated<br>
	with the development of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The necplastic cells are<br>
	assumed to be higher-water content than the surrounding normal prostate cells and<br>
5	 will be heated faster than the normal healthy prostate cells. The normal ductal<br>
	tissue in the prostate is assumed to be in the low- to medium-water content range.<br>
		The safety of employing radiofrequency (microwave) electromagnetic<br>
	fields in order to treat cancer has been questioned. A comprehensive study<br>
	recently concluded that there is no association between the incidence or promotion<br>
10 	of cancer and exposure to radiofrequeney electromagretic fields in the frequency<br>
	range of 3 KHz to 300 GHz (LN. Heynick, Radiofrequency Electromagnetic<br>
	Fields (RFEMF) and Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature Pertinent<br>
	to Air Force Operations, AFRL-HE-BR-TR-1999-0145, United States Air Force<br>
	Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Bioeffects Division, June 1999). Thus,<br>
15	 based on this report, the Applicants realized that there is significant evidence that<br>
	microwave treatment of the prostate can safely heat an apparently healthy prostate<br>
	gland containing microscopic cancer cells such that no new cancer would be<br>
	formed as a result of the microwave treatment.<br>
System for Heating Prostate Tissues<br>
20 		Figure 1 shows a preferred system for heating carcinomas and benign<br>
	tumor cells in prostate tissues., using an adaptive energy, preferably microwave,<br>
	phased array hyperthermia system with E-field and temperature feedback, In order<br>
	to heat deep tissues reliably at energy frequencies, it is necessary to surround the<br>
	body (prostate lobes 220) with two or more energy applicators 110, 111 (within<br>
25	 the urethra 205 and rectum 210, respectively) controlled by an adaptive phased<br>
	array algorithm. The energy applicators 110, 111 may be coherent microwave<br>
	applicators. The blackened circle, indicated as focus 190, represents a central<br>
	tumor or healthy tissue of the prostate 220 that is to be treated.<br>
	Focus 190 may represent cancerous conditions of the prostate including<br>
30 	one of adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, rhabdornyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,<br>
	and osteosarcoma, or pre-cancerous conditions including one of prostatic<br>
	intraepimeliat neoplasia, and benign prostate lesions including benign prostatic<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098 	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
hyperplasia. In addition, the system according to the invention, can treat<br>
apparently healthy tissue in order to prevent the occurrence or re-occurrence of<br>
cancerous or benign conditions.<br>
	In the preferred embodiment, an E-field feedback probe 175 can be<br>
5 	inserted to an appropriate depth in the tissue of prostate 220 that is to be treated.<br>
	Insertion of E-field feedback probe 175 may be achieved under the guidance of an<br>
	ultrasound transducer. Means for setting the initial energy phase delivered to each<br>
	applicator 110,111 includes E-field feedback signals 450 from the E-field. probe<br>
	175 and computer 250 with an appropriate algorithm in order to focus the energy<br>
10 	radiation at the inserted E-field probe 175- Preferably, the E-field probe 175 is<br>
	used with an adaptive phased array fast-acceleration gradient search algorithm, as<br>
	disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,888 to Fenn, to target the energy radiation at the<br>
	tumor site 190,<br>
	In addition, the system according to the invention includes means for<br>
15 	setting the initial energy or microwave power delivered to each energy applicator,<br>
	and means for monitoring the temperatures of walls of the urethra and rectum<br>
	adjacent the prostate that is to be treated to ensure that those walls are not<br>
	overheated. The means for monitoring urethral and rectal walls may include<br>
	temperature feedback sensors 410 that are inserted non-invasively against file<br>
20 	urethral and rectal walls (215,216) in order to monitor the temperatures of the<br>
	urethral and rectum walls adjacent the prostate tissue. Temperature feedback<br>
	sensors 410 send temperature feedback signals 400 to computer 250 where signals<br>
	400 are used to adjust the relative microwave power level that is to be delivered to<br>
	applicators 110, 111 to heat the tumor or tissue at focus 190.<br>
25 	Preferably, the design of the transurethral and transrectal energy<br>
	applicators, which preferably are microwave applicators, is according to U.S, Pat.<br>
	No, 5,007,437 to Sterzer. The transrectal applicator, in particular, may use a<br>
	reflector or a phased array to direct microwave energy preferentially towards the<br>
	prostate. The applicators can be noninvasive applicators such as waveguide,<br>
30	 monopolc, or dipole antennas, or interstitial applicators 109 (see Figure 3) such as<br>
	monopole or dipole antennas. In a. preferred embodiment, the applicators can be<br>
.	 driven coherently as a phased array, in addition, multiple applicators 108<br>
-23-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br>
surrounding the prostate 220 (see Figure 4) that can be driven non-coherently in a<br>
	multiple frequency array can be used to selectively heat the prostate tissue.<br>
		Preferably, the body or prostate 220 is compressed between two<br>
	compression balloons 112,113, which surround transurethral and teansrectal<br>
5	 applicators 110,111. respectively. Compression balloons 112,113 can be inflated<br>
	with distilled or deionized water. In the alternative, the compression balloons<br>
	112,113 can be inflated pneumatically or by other known means to inflate<br>
	balloons. Compression balloons 112, 113 are made from a material such as latex<br>
	that is transparent to microwaves. In addition, to immobilizing the prostate tissue<br>
10	 and fixing the positions of the applicators, prostate compression has a number of<br>
	potential advantages for hyperthermia treatments. Utilization of prostate<br>
	compression results in less penetration depth required to achieve deep microwave<br>
	heating and reduces blood flow, which also improves the ability to heat tissue.<br>
		Injection of a local anesthetic drug such as lidocaine with ephmephrine, or<br>
15 	anti-angiogenesis drug into the prostate tissue can be used to reduce blood flow as<br>
	well. In a preferred method, according to the invention, both the prostate<br>
	compression technique and drug therapy for reducing blood flow in the prostate<br>
	gland are used to allow rapid heating of the microscopic, malignant and benign<br>
	cancer cells. This preferred method can be administered as a preventive means<br>
20	 for cancer and BPH when PSA levels are less than 4, and for BPH when the AUA<br>
	Symptom Index scores less than 13.<br>
		Compressing the prostate from the inside and outside of the prostate moves<br>
	the surface of the prostate gland farther from the microwave applicator radiators,<br>
	which helps to reduce superficial hot spots. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
25	 applicator would have a fluid filled cavity thai would improve coupling of the<br>
	microwave energy from the applicator to tissue to be treated. Cooling of the fluid,<br>
	such as distilled or deionized water, within the transurethral and transrectal<br>
	applicators or applicator balloons during hyperthermia treatments helps avoid the<br>
	potential for developing hot spots in the urethra 205 and rectum 210 thereby<br>
30 	protecting the urethral and rectal walls from overheating.<br>
		Prior to the adaptive phased array hypcrthermia treatment, the prostate is<br>
	compressed between compression balloons 112,113 and a single invasive E-field<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	feedback probe 175 is inserted within the central tissue site (focus 190) in the<br>
	prostate, parallel to the polarization of the microwave applicators 110, 111. The<br>
	microwave applicators 110, 111 are either monopole or dipole antenna radiators of<br>
	straight or helical shape. E-field probe 175 is used to monitor the focal E-field<br>
5	 amplitude as the phase snifters are adjusted for maximum feedback signal using an<br>
	adaptive phased array gradient search algorithm. Noninvasive temperature sensors<br>
	410 monitor the urethral and rectal wall temperatures at positions 184,185,<br>
	respectively, and these signals are individually transmitted to the computer as<br>
	temperature feedback signals 400.<br>
10 		The tips of temperature sensors 410 can be attached to the outside of the<br>
	transurethral and transrectal compression balloons 112,113 as long as the tips are<br>
	thermally insulated. The thermal isolation can be achieved by mounting a thin pad<br>
	(not shown) between the temperature probe and the outside surface of the balloon,<br>
	from the effects of the cooling fluid contained with the compression balloons. The<br>
	15 dual-applicator adaptive phased array of the invention together with the E-field<br>
	feedback probe allows the phase shifters to be adjusted so that a concentrated<br>
	E-field can be generated permitting focused hearing in tissue at the appropriate<br>
	depth.<br>
		Preferably, temperature sensors 410 are non-invasively inserted through<br>
20	 file openings of the uretnra 205 and rectum 210 so that the sensors 410 are in<br>
	pressure contact with the respective, urethral and rectal wall. Thus, as shown in<br>
	Figure 1, two temperature feedback probe sensors 410 are located in the urethra<br>
	205 and rectum 210, respectively and produce temperature feedback signals 400.<br>
	Two microwave water-cooled catheters 300,301 with microwave applicators 110,<br>
25 	111, respectively, are positioned in the urethra 205 and rectum 210, Transurethral<br>
	catheter 300 contains a Foley balloon 118 that is air inflated in the bladder 202 to<br>
	fix the microwave applicator 110 in the correct position with respect to the target<br>
	area of the prostate.<br>
		For coherent treatments, an oscillator 105 is divided at node 107 and feeds<br>
30	 phase shifters 120, Oscillator 105 in a preferred method is a microwave energy<br>
	source at approximately 915 MHz. The phase control signal 125 controls the phase<br>
	of the microwave signal over the range of 0 to 360 electrical degrees. The<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	microwave signal from each phase shifter 120 feeds into microwave power<br>
	amplifiers 130. The resultant microwave signal is controlled by a computer-<br>
	generated control signal 135, which sets the initial microwave power level<br>
	delivered to each microwave applicator. Microwave signals 150 in the form of<br>
5	 coherent 915 MHz microwave power is delivered by the microwave power<br>
	amplifier 130 to the two applicators 110, 111 while phase shifters 120 in each<br>
	channel are adjusted to maximize and focus the microwave energy at the E-field<br>
	probe sensor 175 so that microwave power is maximized at the focus position 190.<br>
	The treatment then begins.<br>
10 	In another embodiment, the means for monitoring temperature of the<br>
	prostate is a temperature probe that is inserted at an appropriate depth in the<br>
	prostate tissue. In this case, after the means for setting the initial relative energy<br>
	phase delivered to each applicator is focussed at the E-field probe 175, the E-field<br>
	probe can be removed and the temperature probe 176 can be inserted in its place<br>
15 	temperature at an appropriate depth in the prostate tissue.<br>
		In yet another embodiment envisioned by the invention, a second<br>
	temperature monitoring means, in addition to the non-invasive temperature<br>
	sensors in pressure contact with the watts of the urethra and the rectum, is<br>
	provided. The second temperature monitoring means is the invasive temperature<br>
20 	probe 176 that is inserted in the prostate tissue in the same spot from which the E-<br>
	field probe 175 removed.<br>
		The system and method according to the invention enable all of the treated<br>
	prostate carcinomas, pre-cancerous cells, and benign lesions to be destroyed when<br>
	the desired total microwave energy dose has been delivered to the microwave<br>
25	 applicators while avoiding damage to the normal tissue of the prostate.<br>
		For non-coherent treatments, separate oscillators 105, which preferably<br>
	operate at 915 MHz, could feed two microwave power amplifiers 130 that are<br>
	computer controlled and deliver microwave power to two applicators 110, 111.<br>
	For applications where a single applicator can be used, as shown in Figure 2, a<br>
30	 single applicator 110 located in the urethra is preferred.<br>
		During the hyperthermia treatment, the microwave signals 150 and power<br>
	level delivered to each of the applicators is measured as a power feedback signal<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	500, which is sent to a microprocessor or computer 250 such as a PC The power<br>
	control signal of the power amplifiers 130 is adjusted either manually or<br>
	automatically to control the urethra and. rectum temperatures, as well as, the<br>
	equivalent thermal dose delivered to the prostate tissue. The sensors 410 measure<br>
5 	the urethral and rectal wall temperatures and the power control signal 135 is<br>
	adjusted based on the sensed temperature to avoid high temperatures that could<br>
	cause bums or blisters. The amount of compression realized by compression<br>
	balloons 112,113 is adjusted as necessary during treatment to provide patient<br>
	comfort. Each time the prostate compression is adjusted, for coherent treatments,<br>
10 	the phase shifters 120 are Teadjusted/refocused so that the E-field probe 175<br>
	receives maximum power.<br>
		According to the system according to the invention, means for monitoring<br>
	the microwave energy delivered to the microwave applicators 110,111 monitor the<br>
	delivered energy/power during treatment and when the desired total microwave<br>
15 	energy has been delivered by the microwave applicators 110,111 to the prostate,<br>
	means for terminating the treatment turn off the energy radiation to the<br>
	applicators. That is, the system and method according to the invention<br>
	automatically turns off the energy that is being delivered to the prostate, thereby<br>
	completing the hyperthermia treatment when a desired total microwave energy<br>
20 	dose has been delivered to the prostate 220. In a preferred embodiment, the total<br>
	microwave energy dose produces a total equivalent thermal dose in prostate<br>
	tumors, which is approximately between 60 minutes and 400 minutes relative to<br>
	43 degrees Celsius. The total microwave energy, since the start of the treatment,<br>
	delivered to the microwave applicators is computed within computer 250 and can<br>
25	 be displayed on the computer monitor 260 during the treatment.<br>
		As an alternate embodiment, means are provided for monitoring the<br>
	microwave power level delivered to the E-field probe 175 to determine-when the<br>
	treatment should be terminated. According to this embodiment, the total<br>
	microwave energy calculated from the E-field feedback signal 450 received by the<br>
30 	E-field probe 175 is used to control the length of the treatment. This E-field<br>
	feedback signal 450 can be useful for both coherent and non-coherent treatments,<br>
	In order to determine the effectiveness of the treatment, me prostate tissue is<br>
-27-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	imaged with one of x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging before and after the<br>
	microwave total energy dose is administered, as well as pathological results from<br>
	needle biopsy of the prostate tissues.<br>
		For coherent treatments, file single invasive E-field. probe 175 can be<br>
5	 replaced, with two noninvasive E-field sensors at fixed positions 186,187 within<br>
	the urethra and rectum, respectively. The E-field sensors are inserted in the<br>
	natural openings of the uretnra 205, and rectum 210 and fixed in a position that is<br>
	suitable to heat the tumor or healthy tissue. E-field sensors can be attached to the<br>
	urethral and rectal walls at positions 186,187, but they do not have to be in<br>
10 	contact with the urethral and rectal walls. Ultrasound, x-rays or other known E-<br>
	field monitoring device can verify the suitable E-field sensor positions. The total<br>
	power measured by the two noninvasive E-field sensors is minimized (as in U.S,<br>
	Pat- No. 5,810,888) by adjusting the microwave phase shifters 120, to create a<br>
	focused E-field in the central portion of the prostate, or the area of the prostate to<br>
15 	be treated.<br>
		With this embodiment, there is no risk of infection due to an inserted<br>
	probe, no risk of scarring of the skin by a procedure which requires nicking the<br>
	skin and inserting a probe, and no risk of spreading cancer cells as an inserted E-<br>
	field probe is not used. The E-field sensors merely are fixed within the urethra<br>
20 	and rectum and thus, do not pass through a tumor bed thereby reducing the<br>
	possibility of inadvertently seeding viable cancer cells during a surgical procedure,<br>
	thus reducing local recurrences of the cancer in surrounding tissues. Likewise,<br>
	since both the temperature and E-field sensors can be placed in the urethra 205<br>
	and rectum 210 according to this method, the instant invention would work well<br>
25	 when there is no defined single area in the prostate such as in the treatment of<br>
	microscopic prostate disease.<br>
		Preferably, each channel (on either side of node 107) of the phased array<br>
	contains an electronically-variable microwave power amplifier 130 (0 to 100 W),<br>
	an electronically-variable phase shifter 120 (0 to 360 degrees), and water-cooled<br>
30	 micro wave applicators 110,111.<br>
		While the preferred embodiment discloses microwave energy at<br>
	approximately 915 MHz, the frequency of the microwave energy may be between<br>
-28-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	100 MHz and 10 GHz, The frequency of the microwave energy could be selected<br>
	from the range of 902 MHz and 928 MHz. In fact, lower frequencies of energy<br>
	may be used to ablate or prevent cancerous tissue.<br>
		In a preferred embodiment, the initial microwave power delivered to each<br>
5 	applicator is between 0 and 70 Watts, preferably between 20 and 60 Watts. Over<br>
	the entire treatment of the tissue, the microwave power delivered to each<br>
	applicator may be adjusted over the range of 0-150 Watts to deliver the desired<br>
	microwave energy dose and to avoid overheating the urethra and rectum, In<br>
	addition, the relative microwave power delivered to the two microwave<br>
10	 applicators is adjusted between -180 degrees and 180 degrees before and during<br>
	the treatment to create a focussed field in the prostate tissue. Typically, more<br>
	microwave power is required for non-coherent applicator treatments than for<br>
	coherent applicator treatments.<br>
		IN a preferred embodiment, a 0.9-mm outaide-diameter (OD) invasive<br>
15 	E-field coaxial monopole probe (semi-rigid RG-034), with the center conductor<br>
	extended. 1 cm, can be used as E-field probe 175 to measure the amplitude of the<br>
	electric field directed to the tissue and to provide the feedback signal 450 used to<br>
	determine the necessary relative phase for the electronic phase shifters prior to<br>
	treatment, Coaxially-fed monopole probes of this type have been used to make<br>
20 	accurate measurements of linearly polarized electric fields in compressed breast<br>
	phantoms (Fenn et al.f International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility<br>
	17-19 May 1994 pp. 566-569). This linearly-polarized E-field probe is inserted<br>
	within a 1.6 mm OD teflon catheter. Thermocouple probes (Physitemp<br>
	Instruments, Inc., Type T copper-constantan, enclosed within a 0.6 mm OD teflon<br>
25 	sheath) can be used to measure the local temperature in the tumor during<br>
	treatment. These temperature probes have a response time of 100 ms with an<br>
	accuracy of 0.1° C. Fiber-optic temperature probes may also be used.<br>
		The E-field probe 175 is used with the adaptive phased array fast-<br>
	acceleration gradient search algorithm, as disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 5,810,888 to<br>
30 	Fenn, to target the microwave radiation at the tumor site. The temperature sensed<br>
	by the invasive temperature probe 175 in the tumor could be used as a real-time<br>
	feedback signal during the treatment. This feedback signal 450 could be used to<br>
-29-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br>
	control the microwave output power level of the variable power amplifiers, which<br>
	set and maintain the focal temperature at the tumor site in foe range of 43 to 46° C.<br>
	The power and phase delivered to the two channels of the phased array are<br>
	adjusted adaptively using digital-to-analog converters under computer control.<br>
5 		Total Microwave Energy Dose can be used to estimate the required heating<br>
	time. That is, Applicants realized that a non-invasive equivalent temperature<br>
	sensing means could replace the invasive temperature probes, and that the Total<br>
	Microwave Energy Dose reliably could be used to control the duration of<br>
	treatment. The prostate compression, as mentioned earlier, reduces blood flow,<br>
10 	which likely eliminates the effects of blood flow on the required microwave<br>
	energy for treatment, and may reduce the variation in microwave energy that can<br>
	be expected in microwave treatments.<br>
		Accordingly to a preferred embodiment, the total microwave energy<br>
	delivered to the waveguide applicators to determine completion of the treatment is<br>
15 	between 25 kilo Joules and 250 kilo Joules. The total amount of microwave<br>
	energy dose that would destroy any cancerous or precancerous tissue would be<br>
	approximately 175 kilo Joules, But, under certain conditions, the required<br>
	microwave energy dose may be as low as 25 kilo Joules.<br>
		As applicants recognized, compression of a body that results in a smaller<br>
20 	thickness may require less microwave energy dose (compared to a compression<br>
	that results in a larger thickness) for effective treatments in preventing or<br>
	destroying cancerous, pre-cancerous or benign lesions. It is important to select an<br>
	appropriate initial microwave power level (P1,P2) delivered to each applicator as<br>
	well as the proper microwave phase between the two applicators to focus the<br>
25 	energy at the area to be treated.<br>
		During hyperthermia treatment, it is necessary to monitor the urethral and<br>
	rectal wall temperatures so that they do not rise significantly above about 41<br>
	degrees Celsius for more than several minutes. The equivalent thermal dose for<br>
	the urethral and rectal wall sensors can be calculated (Sapareto, et al, Internationa]<br>
30 	Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 10, pp. 787-800,1984) and<br>
	can be used as a feedback signal Typically, it is necessary to avoid delivering<br>
	more than a few equivalent minutes thermal dose. Avoiding high urethral and<br>

WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	rectal temperatures according to the invention is accomplished by adjusting the<br>
	individual powers (P1, P2) delivered to the applicators during treatment either by<br>
	manual or automatic computer control<br>
		Doppler ultrasound can be used to measure blood flow in tumors and<br>
5 	surrounding prostate tissue, before and during treatment to plan and adjust the<br>
	microwave energy dose. For example, less energy dose is required when the<br>
	tumor blood flow rate is reduced which can occur when the prostate is compressed<br>
	and/or the tumor is heated to therapeutic temperatures. Alternatively, the water<br>
	content and. dielectric parameters of prostate tumor tissue from needle biopsies<br>
10 	could be measured and used to determine, prior to the treatment, me required<br>
	microwave energy dose. For example, higher water content and higher electrical<br>
	conductivity in the tumor would reduce the amount of required microwave energy<br>
	dose. In addition to the above variables, the size of the tumor impacts the required<br>
	microwave energy dose. Larger tumors are more difficult to heat than smaller<br>
15 	tumors and require a larger microwave energy dose. An initial treatment planning<br>
	session involving a low-dose delivery of microwave energy to assess the<br>
	heatability of the tumor, followed by a complete treatment at the full required<br>
	microwave energy dose may be performed.<br>
Clinical Motivation for Safety Features<br>
20	 In thermotherapy treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic<br>
	hyperplasia, it is desirable to achieve therapeutic temperatures in the prostate<br>
	while maintaining lower temperatures in the urethra and rectum. As the<br>
	surrounding tissues in the urethra and rectum tend to be heated while microwave<br>
	energy irradiates the prostate gland, methods for safely heating the prostate while<br>
25 	protecting the surrounding healthy tissues need to be devebped.<br>
		In Figures 1-4, following application of microwave thermotherapy,<br>
	microwave power control signals 135 command at least one of the microwave<br>
	power amplifier 130 for the transurethral applicator and/or the microwave<br>
	amplifier 130 for the transrectal applicator to turn off and at least one of a<br>
30 	transurethral balloon 112 and a transrectal balloon 113 maintain pressure on the<br>
	prostate gland to reduce blood flow thereby trapping heat to accumulate additional<br>
	thermal dose. This safety embodiment can be used for heat-alone prostate<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 20O4/026098	PCT7US2003/028898<br><br>
	treatments or when thermotherapy is used with chemotherapy or to release<br>
	chemotherapy from thermosensitive liposomes as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
	5,81 0,888 to Fenn. The blood flow rate can be measured and displayed during<br>
	prostate compression by doppler ultrasound imaging in order to verity and adjust<br>
5 	the blood flow rate in the prostate by varying the amount of prostate compression.<br>
		In chemotherapy, thermosensitive liposome delivered chemotherapy, or<br>
	gene therapy for prostate cancer it is desirable to deliver as much drug as possible<br>
	to the tissue to be treated of a patient. The desired therapeutic agent in the form of<br>
	chemotherapy, thermosensitive liposome delivered chemotherapy, gene therapy, or<br>
10 	other agent is infused into the blood stream of a patient. The compression of the<br>
	transurethral and/or transrectal balloon catheters may be modulated so that the<br>
	blood flow in the prostate tissue can be adjusted. The blood flow in the prostate is<br>
	reduced by increasing pressure of the compression balloons in the urethra and/or<br>
	rectum. This reduction in blood flow in the prostate means that me infused<br>
15	therapeutic agent will spend more time within the prostate tissue, potentially<br>
	increasing the therapeutic value. Further, if the therapeutic agent spends more<br>
	time within the prostatic blood vessels, there is an increased likelihood that the<br>
	therapeutic agent will extravasate (permeate or leak) from the blood vessels into<br>
	the prostatic tissues to reach the prostate cancer cells. Consequently, the<br>
20 	compression of the prostate may increase the amount of therapeutic agent<br>
	delivered to the prostate while decreasing the amount of therapeutic agent released<br>
	into normal healthy surrounding tissues.<br>
		The desired sequence of balloon compression of the prostate is as follows.<br>
	After chemotherapy, thermosensitive liposome delivered chemotherapy, gene<br>
25	 therapy, or another agent is infused into the patient's bloodstream, the prostate<br>
	gland is compressed by at least one of the transurethral and transrectal balloon<br>
	catheters for a period of between 1 minute and 10 minutes. Then, at least one of<br>
	the transurethral and transrectal balloons is deflated to allow normal blood flow<br>
	into the prostate for a period of less than 1 minute to allow the therapeutic agent to<br>
30 	enter the prostatic bloodstream, but without substantially lowering the temperature<br>
	of the prostate. And then the prostate gland is compressed again for a period of<br>
	between 1 minute and 10 minutes to reduce the blood flow thereby trapping the<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	therapeutic agent within the prostate gland. The above described process of<br>
	inflation and deflation of the balloon catheter(s) is repeated until the desired<br>
	amount of therapeutic agent is delivered to the prostate while the prostate is<br>
	heated.<br>
5 		In a preferred embodiment, the chemotherapy agent is Doxorubicin<br>
	(Adriamycin). In another preferred embodiment, the thermosensitive liposome<br>
	formulation is as described in U.S. Pat No, 6,200,598 to Needham.<br>
		Applicants envision that doppler ultrasound imaging may be employed to<br>
	determine the blood flow rate of the tumor. That is, doppler ultrasound imaging<br>
10	 can measure the tumor blood flow rate with or without compression of the prostate<br>
	and use these measurements as feedback during the treatment in order to assess<br>
	any damage to the prostate tumor vasculature.<br>
	Simplified Microwave_Radiation Theory<br>
		Microwave energy from hyperthernia applicators, in the near field of a<br>
15	 body, radiates as a spherical wave with the electric-field amplitude varying, in<br>
	part, as the inverse of the radial distance r from the applicator. Additionally, the<br>
	amplitude decays as an exponential function of the product of the attenuation<br>
	constant α of the body tissue and the distance d traversed (or depth) within the<br>
	body as indicated, in Figure 1, The electric-field phase varies linearly with<br>
20	 distance according to the product of the phase propagation constant β and distance<br>
	d. For simplicity, dual-opposing applicators are analyzed here under the<br>
	assumption that the applicator radiation is approximated by a plane wave.<br>
	Mathematically, the plane-wave electric field versus depth in tissue is given by<br>
	E(d)=Eo exp(-αd) exp(-iβd), where Eo is the surface electric field (in general<br>
25	 represented by an amplitude and phase angle), and i is the imaginary number<br>
	(Field and Hand, An Introduction to the Practical Aspects of Clinical<br>
	Hyperthermia, Taylor &amp; Francis, New York p. 263,1990),<br>
		Plane-wave electromagnetic energy, at the microwave frequency of 915<br>
	MHz, attenuates at a rale of about 3 dB per cm in high-water content tissue, such<br>
30	 as prostate tissue. Thus, a single radiating applicator has a significant fraction of<br>
	its microwave energy absorbed by intervening superficial body tissue compared to<br>
	the energy that irradiates deep tissue, likely creating a hot spot in superficial tissue.<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	Since surface cooling with, either air or water protects tissue only to a maximum<br>
	depth of about 0.25 to 0,5 cm, in order to avoid hot spots, it is necessary to<br>
	introduce a second phase-coherent'applicator, having the same microwave<br>
	radiation amplitude as the first applicator. The second phase-coherent applicator<br>
5 	can theoretically increase the power (and hence the energy) delivered to deep<br>
	tissue by a factor of four compared to a single applicator (Field and Hand, p. 290,<br>
	1990).<br>
	The pbase characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation from two or<br>
	more applicators (known as a phased array) can have a pronounced affect on the<br>
10	 distribution of power delivered to different tissues. The relative specific<br>
	absorption rate (SAR) in homogeneous tissue is approximated by the square of the<br>
	electric-field amplitude |E|2. The SAR is proportional to the rise in temperature<br>
	over a given time interval. A simplified case, homogeneous prostate tissue, in<br>
	which the microwave radiation is focused at a central tissue site, is described in<br>
15 	detail below. As described in an. article by Fenn et al., international Symposium<br>
	on Electromagnetic Compatibility, Sendai, Japan, Vol. l0,No. 2, May 17-19,<br>
	1994, pp. 566-569, the effects of multiple microwave signal reflections within the<br>
	phantom can be ignored.<br>
		The wavelength in homogeneous normal prostate tissue (with approximate<br>
20	 dielectric constant 50 and electrical conductivity 13 S/m) is approximately 4,5 cm<br>
	at 915 MHz, and the microwave loss is 3 dB/cm. The attenuation constant α is<br>
	0.34 radians/cm and the propagation constant β is 1.4 radians/cm (or 80<br>
	degrees/cm). (For a compressed prostate thickness of 2.25 cm, the electric field of<br>
	a single applicator radiating on the left side is E0 at the surface of the prostate,<br>
25 	-i0.7E0 (where i represents a 90-degree phase shift) at the central position (1.125<br>
	cm deep), and -0.5E0 at the right surface. Combining two phase coherent<br>
	applicators yields an electric-field value of 0.5EO on both surfaces and -i1. 4EO at<br>
	the central position (1.125 cm depth). Thus, for the compressed prostate, by<br>
	squaring the above coherent E-fields to compute SAR, there is a significantly<br>
30 	lower SAR at the surface, by about a factor of 2.0 compared to the central SAR,<br>
	The 180-degree phase shift experienced by the microwave field transmitted<br>
	through 2.25 cm of prostate tissue, partly cancels or nulls the field entering the<br>
-34-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	tissue with 0-degree phase shift. Due to destructive interference of the<br>
	microwaves away fiom the central focus lower temperatures in the superficial<br>
	prostate tissues would be expected. Measurement and enforcement of lower SAR<br>
	on the opposing surfaces effectively focuses the microwave energy deep in the<br>
5 	prostate. In cases where it is desirable to radiate the superficial or peripheral zone<br>
	prostate tissues more strongly, the compression thickness can be larger than 2.25<br>
	cm so that the propagating wave phase delay is longer and the two waves do not<br>
	cancel at the surface, or only one of the ixansurethral or transrectal applicators<br>
	(especially the transrectal applicator) can be used to heat the prostate.<br>
10 		Repeating the above calculation, but now for non-coherent applicators, for<br>
	a compressed prostate thickness of 2.25 cm, the electric field of a single applicator<br>
	radiating on the left side is Eo at the surface of the prostate, -i0.7E0 (where i<br>
	represents a 90-degree phase shift) at the central position (1.125 cm deep), and<br>
	-0.5E0 at the right surface. Combining two applicators non-coherentiy, by<br>
15 	squaring the individual E-fields and adding them, yields a SAR. value of 1.5E02 on<br>
	both surfaces and 0.98 E02 at the central position (1.125 cm depth). Thus, for the<br>
	compressed prostate, by squaring the above non-coherent E-fields to compute<br>
	SAR, there is a significantly higher SAB, at thd surface, by about a factor of 1.5<br>
	compared to the central SAR, For this reason, it is more difficult to heat deep<br>
20 	prostate tissue with the non-coherent array compared to the coherent array.<br>
		However, as mentioned earlier, for prostate cancer treatment some of the prostate<br>
	cancer cells can be located close to the rectum and non-coherent treatment may<br>
	provide adequate heating.<br>
		The adaptive phased array system according to the invention uses two<br>
25 	microwave channels, fed by a common oscillator 105, containing two<br>
electronically adjustable phase shifters 120 to focus the microwave energy at an<br>
	E-field feedback probe 175. This inventive adaptive phased array system has<br>
	significant advantage over a non-adaptive phased array. A non-adaptive phased<br>
	array with two channels could., in theory, produce a null, a maximum, or an<br>
30 	intermediate value of E- field depending on whether the two waves are 180 degrees<br>
	out-of-phase, completely in-phase, or partly out-of-phase, respectively. That is,<br>
	the microwave phase delivered to the microwave applicators, according to the<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	invention, can be adjusted between -180 degrees and 180 degrees before and<br>
	during the treatment to create a focused field in the prostate tissue.<br>
		The adaptive phased array according to the invention automatically focuses<br>
	the E-field in the presence of all scattering structures in the tissue. Thus, the<br>
5 	adaptive phased array according to the invention should provide more reliable<br>
	deep focused heating compared to manually adjusted or pre-treatment planning<br>
	controlled phased, arrays as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,589,423 to Turner.<br>
	Furthermore, the adaptive phased array system according to the invention does not<br>
	use an invasive temperature probe, which could scatter or alter the E-field at the<br>
10 	tumor site.<br>
	Calculation of Microwave Energy<br>
	Electrical energy consumption is commonly expressed in units of kilowatt<br>
	hours. Mathematically, the expression for the microwave energy W delivered by<br>
	an applicator is given by (Vitrogan, Elements of Electric and Magnetic Circuits,<br>
15 	Rinehart Press, San Francisco, pp. 31-34, 1971):<br>
	W=ΔtΣPt. (1)<br>
	In the above equation. Δt represents the constant intervals (in seconds) in which<br>
	microwave power is measured and the summation Σ is over the complete<br>
	treatment interval with the power (in Watts) in the ith interval denoted by Pi<br>
20	 The microwave energy Whas units of watt-seconds, which is also<br>
	designated as Joules. For example, in three consecutive 60-second intervals if the<br>
	microwave power is 30 watts, 50 watts, 60 watts, respectively, the total<br>
		microwave energy delivered in 180 seconds is calculated as W= 60 (30 + 50 + 60)<br>
	= 8,400 watt-seconds = 8,400 Joules = 8.4 kJ.<br>
25 	To understand better the focused energy per unit time W' (where' denotes<br>
	prime) deposited at a central position in homogeneous prostate tissue of varying<br>
	thickness (denoted by D) by dual-opposing applicators, consider the following<br>
	calculation for coherent treatments. Let P1 and P2 be the power delivered to the<br>
	two applicators, respectively. The electric field radiated by each applicator is<br>
30 	proportional to the square root of the power delivered, to the applicator- Assuming<br>
	symmetry, the radiated fields are in-phase at the central focused position from the<br>
	two applicators. Assuming equal power from each applicator, that is, P1 - P2 = P,<br>
-36-<br><br>
WO 2004/026098	PCT/US2003/028898<br><br>
	and plane wave illumination, then the focused energy per unit time at the central<br>
	depth is expressed as<br>
	W'(D)= |E|2=4Pexp(-αD). (2)<br>
	Calculation of Equivalent Thermal Dose<br>
5 	the cumulative or total equivalent thermal dose relative to 43 degrees<br>
	Celsius is calculated as a summation (Sapareto, et al, International Journal of<br>
	Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol, 10, pp, 787-800,1984):<br>
	t43ºC equivalent minutes -Δt ΣR(47-T) , (3)<br>
	where Σ is the summation over a series of temperature measurements during the<br>
10	 treatment, Tis the series of temperature measurements (T1, T2 T3,...), Δt is the<br>
	constant interval of time (unite of seconds and: converted to minutes) between<br>
	measurements, R is equal to 0.5 if T&gt;43º C and R is equal to 0.25 if T
	equivalent thermal dose calculation is useful for assessing any possible heat<br>
	damage to the prostate tissues, urethra and rectum.<br>

		While this invention has been particularly shown, and described with<br>
	reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it mil be understood by those skilled<br>
	in the art that various changes in form and details maybe made therein without<br>
	departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>

	respect to the treatment of prostate carcinomas and benign prostate lesions, the<br>

	liver, lung, and ovarian. In addition to the disclosed preferred embodiments, it is<br>
	understood that the methods disclosed here can be applied, to microwave,<br>

	portions of the human body, such as legs and arms and the torso that can be<br>
