CATALYST COMPONENT FOR OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION AND CATALYST<br>
COMPRISING THE SAME<br>
Cross Reference of Related Application<br>
The present application claims the benefit of the Chinese Patent Application Nos. 2004100374186 filed on April 30, 2004, 2005100004821 filed on January 13, 2005, and 2005100004817 filed on January 13, 2005, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a solid catalyst component for olefin polymerization comprising a dibasic ester compound having a specific structure, a catalyst comprising the same, and use of said catalyst in polymerization of olefin CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or C1-C-12 alkyl or aryl group. In particular, when the catalyst is used in polymerization of propylene, polymer with higher isotacticity and broader molecular weight distribution can be obtained in higher yield.<br>
Background Art of the Invention<br>
It is well known that solid titanium catalyst component with magnesium, titanium, halogen and electron donor as basic compositions can be used in the polymerization of olefin CH?=CHR, especially in the polymerization of alpha-olefins having 3 or more carbon atoms, higher isotactic polymer can be obtained in higher yield. An electron donor (ED) compound is one of indispensable compositions of catalyst component, and with the development of internal ED compound, polyolefin catalyst is continuously renovated.<br>
At present, a large number of various ED compounds have been disclosed, for instance, polycarboxylic acids, monocarboxylic esters or polycarboxylic esters, anhydrides, ketones, monoethers or polyethers, alcohols, amines, and their derivatives, among of which aromatic dicarboxylic esters, such as di-n-butyl phthalate or diisobutyl phthalate (cf. CN85100997A), are commonly used. See also EP 0045977 (phthalates); CN1042547A, EP0361493, EP0728724 (1,3-diether compounds); CN1054139A, CN1105671A (1,3-diketone compounds); CN1236732, CN1236733, CN1236734, CN1292800 (specific substituted malonates), PCT International Application WO 0063261 (succinates), PCT International Application WO0055215 ((3-substituted glutarates), CN1242780 (cyano-esters), CN1087918 (diamines), PCT International Application WO03022894 (maleates), CN1436766A, CN1436796A (a specific kind of<br>
1<br><br>
polyol esters) for ED compounds.<br>
However, the catalysts disclosed in above-mentioned publications have some disadvantages in use of olefin polymerization. The present inventors have surprisingly found that catalysts for olefin polymerization exhibiting excellent general performance can be obtained by using a novel dibasic ester compound as internal ED. When used in propylene polymerization, the catalysts exhibit satisfied polymerization activity and good hydrogen response, and the resulting polymers have higher stereoselectivity and broader molecular weight distribution (MWD). These properties are desired in the development of different grades of polymers.<br>
In addition, in the prior art, one approach commonly used to improve general performance of catalysts is to use more than one ED compounds in the preparation of the catalysts. For instance, CN1268957A discloses the use of two ED compounds in the preparation of catalysts, wherein one ED compound is selected from the group consisting of ether compounds containing two or more ether bonds, and the other is selected from the group consisting of ester compounds of monocarboxylic acids or polycarboxylic acids. The prepared catalysts exhibit higher polymerization activity, and the resultant polypropylene resins have higher content of insolubles in xylene and lower crystallinity, so that the polymers are suitable to prepare bi-oriented polypropylene film (BOPP). For another example, WO03/002617 proposes to add at first a minor amount of monofuntional compound, for example ethyl benzoate, followed by the addition of another ED compound in the preparation of a catalyst. Although the obtained catalyst contains little or undetectable said monofuntional compound, it exhibits improved catalytic activity and melt flow index property. Although the properties of the catalysts are improved by these methods in some extent, the catalysts are still unsatisfactory in terms of MWD of the polymers.<br>
The present inventors have found that catalyst components and catalysts exhibiting excellent general performance can be obtained by using said dibasic ester compound and a 1,3-diether compound or a phthalate ester compound as internal ED in the catalyst for olefin polymerization. When used in olefin polymerization, especially in propylene polymerization, the catalysts exhibit higher polymerization activity, and the resulting polymers have broader MWD.<br>

Another aspect of the invention relates to a process for the polymerization of olefin using the catalyst according to the invention, said process comprising contacting olefin CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or C-1-C12 alkyl or aryl group, and optional<br>
14<br><br>
comonomer with the catalyst or the prepolymerized catalyst according to the invention under polymerization conditions.<br>
The polymerization of olefin(s) is carried out in liquid phase or in gas phase or in a combination of gas phase and liquid phase, according to well-known processes. For instance, conventional techniques, such as slurry polymerization techniques or gas phase fluidized bed polymerization techniques could be used, and the olefins can be selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and 1-hexene. In particular, the olefin polymerization can be homopolymerization of propylene or copolymerization of propylene and other olefin(s). The polymerization is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 0°C to 150°C, preferably from 60°C to 90°C.<br>
The catalysts of the invention can be directly added to the reactors for polymerization. Alternatively, the catalysts may be prepolymerized before being added to a first polymerization reactor. The term "prepolymerized catalyst" as used herein intends to mean the catalyst that has been subjected to a polymerization at lower conversion extent. According to the invention, said prepolymerized catalysts comprise the prepolymers obtained by prepolymering an olefin in the presence of the solid catalyst components, with the prepolymerization times being in a range of from 0.1 to 1000 grams olefin polymer per gram solid catalyst component.<br>
It is possible to use an a-olefin as defined above in the prepolymerization, with ethylene or propylene being preferred. Specifically, it is especially preferred to use ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with one or more ( olefins in an amount up to 20mol% in the prepolymerization reaction. Preferably, the conversion extent of the solid catalyst components prepolymerized is in a range of from about 0.2 to about 500 grams polymer per gram solid catalyst component.<br>
The prepolymerization process can be performed at a temperature of from -20 to 80°C, preferably from 0 to 50°C, in liquid phase or gas phase. The pressure of the prepolymerization process can be in a range of from 0.01 to 10 MPa, and the prepolymerization time depends on prepolymerization temperature and pressure used and conversion extent required. The prepolymerization step can be carried out on-line as a part of a continuous polymerization process, or carried out separately in a batch operation. For preparing polymer in an amount of 0.5-20 g/g catalyst component, batch prepolumerization of ethylene in the presence of the catalysts according to the invention is preferred.<br>
The catalysts according to the invention are also useful in the production of polyethylene and copolymer of ethylene and other (olefins, such as propylene, butene, pentene, hexene, octene, and 4-methyl-1-pentene.<br>
15<br><br>
According to the invention, catalysts exhibiting excellent general performance can be obtained by using the novel dibasic ester ED compounds (internal ED compound (a)), and optionally further using the internal ED compound (b) and/or (c) in combination. When used in propylene polymerization, the catalysts exhibit satisfied polymerization activity, and the resulting polymers have higher stereoselectivity and broader molecular weight distribution. These properties are desired in the development of different grades of polymers.<br>

The reactor was heated to 70°C, and the polymerization was performed at that temperature for one hour. After the temperature was reduced and the pressure was relieved, PP powder was removed. Polymerization results were summarized in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br>
It can be seen from the data shown in Table 1 that polypropylene resins obtained by using catalysts according to the present invention have broader molecular weight distribution, generally larger than 6.5, while the polymer obtained by using catalyst of the prior art containing dibutyl phthalate as internal ED has a value of Mw/Mn of 5.3.<br>
Example 30:<br>
To a reactor in which atmosphere was completely replaced with highly pure N2 was added 100ml of TiCI4. The content was cooled to -20°C, and 7 0 g of MgC!2 2.6EtOH spherical support (prepared following the procedure as described in Example 2 of USP 4,399,054, except for that the operation was conducted at 2800 rpm rather than 10000 rpm) was added thereto. The temperature was raised to 0 °C over 1 h, then to 20°C over 2 hrs, then to 40 °C over 1 h. To the reactor was added 6mmol of dibasic ester compound synthesized in Preparation Example 19, and the reaction was heated to 100 °C over 1 h, and held at the temperature for further 2 hrs. After removing the mother liquid, 100ml of TiCI4 was added thereto and the reaction was heated to 120 °C over 1 h, and held at the temperature for further 2 hrs. After removing the mother liquid, the residue was then washed with 60ml of hexane under boiling state for five times, and 60ml of hexane at normal temperature for three times, to yield 4.9 g of spherical catalyst component.<br>

The reaction was conducted at 15°C and 1atm pressure with propylene metered into. When predetermined amount of propylene giving desired prepolymerization times (prepolymerization times = weight of introduced propylene/weight of the solid catalyst component) was metered, the introduction of propylene was stopped. Then the resultant suspension was stirred at 15°C for further 1 hour so that propylene was sufficiently polymerized, to give a catalyst suspension having desired prepolymerization times.<br>
