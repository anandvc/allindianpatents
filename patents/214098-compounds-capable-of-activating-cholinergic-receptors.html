				<td>COMPOUNDS CAPABLE OF ACTIVATING<br>
CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to generally to nicotinic compounds. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to compounds that, when administered and,<br>
optionally, metabolized, are capable of activating nicotinic cholinergic receptors, for<br>
example, as agonists of specific nicotinic receptor subtypes.<br>
Background<br>
Nicotine has been proposed to have a number of pharmacological effects. See,<br>
for example, Pullan et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 330:811-815 (1994). Certain of those<br>
effects may be related to effects upon neurotransmitter release. See for example,<br>
Sjak-shie et al., Brain Res. 624:295 (1993), where neuroprotective effects of nicotine<br>
are proposed. Release of acetylcholine and dopamine by neurons upon administration<br>
of nicotine has been reported by Rowell et al., /. Neurochem. 43:1593 (1984); Rapier<br>
et al., J. Neurochem. 50:1123 (1988); Sandor et al., Brain Res. 567:313 (1991) and<br>
Vizi, Br. J. Pharmacol. 47:765 (1973). Release of norepinephrine by neurons upon<br>
administration of nicotine has been reported by Hall et al., Biochem. Pharmacol.<br>
21:1829 (1972). Release of serotonin by neurons upon administration of nicotine has<br>
been reported by Hery et al., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 296:91 (1977). Release<br>
of glutamate by neurons upon administration of nicotine has been reported by Toth et<br>
al., Neurochem Res. 17:265 (1992). In addition, nicotine reportedly potentiates the<br>
pharmacological behavior of certain pharmaceutical compositions used for the<br>
treatment of certain disorders. See, Sanberg et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. &amp; Behavior<br>
46:303 (1993); Harsing et al., J. Neurochem. 59:48 (1993) and Hughes, Proceedings<br>
from Intl. Symp. Nic. S40 (1994). Furthermore, various other beneficial<br>
pharmacological effects of nicotine have been proposed. See, Decina et al., Biol.<br>
Psychiatry 28:502 (1990); Wagner et al., Pharmacopsychiatry 21:301 (1988);<br>
Pomerleau et al., Addictive Behaviors 9:265 (1984); Onaivi et al., Life Sci. 54(3):193<br>
(1994); Tripathi et al., JPET 221: 91-96 (1982) and Hamon, Trends in Pharmacol.<br>
Res. 15:36.<br>
Various nicotinie compounds have been reported as being useful for treating a<br>
wldo variety of conditions and disorders. See, for example, Williams et sl. DN&amp;P<br>
7(4):205-227 (1904), Arneric et al., CNS Drug Rev. l(l):l-26 (1995), Americ et al.,<br>
Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs S(1):79-1OO (1996),Bcncberif et al.JPET279:l413 (1996),<br>
Lippicllo et al., JPET279;1422 (1996). Damaj et al., Neurosdence (1997), Holladay<br>
ctaL,7. Mcd. Client. 40(28): 4169-4194 (1997),Bannon et al.,scince 279: 77-80<br>
(1998), PCT WO 94/08992, PCT WO 96/31475, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,583,140 to<br>
Benchorif ot al., 5,597,919 to Dull et al., 5,604,231 to Smith et al, and 5,616,716 to<br>
Dull et al. "Nicoimic compounds are repotted as being particularly useful for treating<br>
a wide variety of Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders.<br>
CNS disorders arc a category of neurological disorders that can arise from<br>
genotic predispositions or environmental factors, such as infection, trauma, and drug<br>
use. In some instances, the etiology of particular CNS disorders is unknown. CNS<br>
disorders comprise ncuropsychiatric disorders, neurological diseases and mental<br>
illnesses; and include neurodcgcncrativc diseases, behavioral disorders, cognitive<br>
disorders and cognitive affective disorders. There are several CNS disorders: whose<br>
clinical manifestations have been attributed to CNS dysfunction (i.e., disorders<br>
resulting from inappropriate levels of neurotiansrniltcr release, inappropriate<br>
properties of neurolransmittcr receptors, and/or inappropriate interaction between<br>
ncurotmusmitters and neurotransmitter receptors). Several CNS disorders can be<br>
attributed to cholincrgic, dopanrinergic, adrenergic and/or serotonergic deficiencies.<br>
CNS disorders of relatively common occurrence include presenile dementia (early<br>
onset Alzheimer"s disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer"s type), Lewy<br>
Body dementia, Parkinsonlsm including Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s chorea,<br>
tardivc dyskincsia, hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, dyslexia,<br>
schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment and Tourette"s syndrome,<br>
It, therefore, is desirable to provide a useful method for the prevention and<br>
treatment of a condition or disorder by administering a nicotinie compound to a<br>
subject susceptible to or suffering from such a malady. It is highly beneficial to<br>
provide individuals suffering from certain disorders (e.g., CNS disorders) with<br>
interruption or reduction in the severity of the symptoms of those disorders by the<br>
administration of a pharmaceutical composition that contains an active ingredient or a<br>
pro-drug form or an N-oxidc having nicotinie pharmacology. It is also desirable to<br>
provide a pharmaceutical composition incorporating a compound that when<br>
administered and metabolized interacts with nicotinic receptors, such as those which<br>
have the potential to affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS), but<br>
that when employed in an amount sufficient to affect the functioning of the central<br>
nervous system (CNS), does not significantly affect those receptor subtypes that have<br>
the potential to induce undesirable side effects (e.g., appreciable activity at skeletal<br>
muscle and ganglia sites).<br>

relates to methods for synthesizing aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds, such as<br>
the compounds of the present invention. For example, methods of synthesizing<br>
isolated enantiomeric forms of aryl substituted olefinic compounds are provided by<br>
the present invention.<br>
The present invention also encompasses pro-drug forms of nicotinic<br>
compounds. The pro-drug forms can include, for example, amide, thioamide,<br>
carbamate, thiocarbamate, urea and thiourea forms of aryl substituted olefinic amine<br>

The present invention also provides methods of making and using pro-drug<br>
forms of nicotinic compounds, such as aryl substituted olefinic amines. The methods<br>
of making pro-drugs include, among others, acylation and alkylation of nicotinic<br>
compounds, such as aryl substituted olefinic amines.<br>
The present invention also encompasses metabolite forms of nicotinic<br>
compounds and methods of making such metabolites. The metabolites can include,<br>
among others, N-de-alkylated and monohydroxy and dihydroxy forms of the aryl<br>
substituted olefinic amines described herein, wherein the mono- or di-hydroxy<br>
functionality is present on the pyridine or pyrimidine rings. The present invention<br>
also encompasses N-oxide forms of aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds and<br>
methods of making and using such N-oxide forms.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods of modulating or altering the<br>
activity of a receptor by administering an effective amount of a compound, a pro-<br>
drug, an N-oxide and/or a salt of the present invention to a subject. The methods can<br>
include modulating the activity of a nicotinic cholinergic receptor by contacting the<br>
receptor with an effective amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods for the prevention and/or<br>
treatment of a wide variety of conditions or disorders, and particularly those disorders<br>
characterized by dysfunction of nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission including<br>
disorders involving neuromodulation of neurotransmitter release, such as dopamine<br>
release. The present invention also relates to methods for the prevention and/or<br>
treatment of disorders, and/or their symptoms such as central nervous system (CNS)<br>
disorders, which are characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter release.<br>
The present invention also encompasses methods for the treatment of certain<br>

and/or a pro-drug, N-oxide, and/or salt from thereof. Such pharmaceutical<br>
compositions incorporate compounds that, when employed in effective amounts, can<br>
interact with relevant nicotinic receptor sites of a subject, thereby allowing the<br>
compound to act as a therapeutic agent in the prevention or treatment of a wide<br>
variety of conditions and disorders and/or symptoms thereof, particularly those<br>
disorders characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter release. Preferred<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise compounds of the present invention and/or<br>
pro-drugs, N-oxides, metabolites and/or pharmaceutical salts thereof.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful for the<br>
prevention and/or treatment of disorders, such as CNS disorders, which are<br>
characterized by an alteration in normal neurotransmitter release, and/or symptoms<br>
associated with such disorders. The pharmaceutical compositions provide therapeutic<br>
benefit to individuals suffering from such disorders and/or exhibiting clinical<br>
manifestations of such disorders in that the compounds within those compositions,<br>
when employed in effective amounts, have the potential to (i) exhibit nicotinic<br>
pharmacology and affect relevant nicotinic receptors sites (e.g., act as a<br>
pharmacological agonist to activate nicotinic receptors), and (ii) elicit<br>
neurotransmitter secretion, and hence prevent and suppress the symptoms associated<br>
with those diseases. In addition, the compounds can (i) increase the number of<br>
nicotinic cholinergic receptors of the brain of the patient, (ii) exhibit neuroprotective<br>
effects and (iii) when employed in effective amounts do not cause appreciable adverse<br>
side effects (e.g., significant increases in blood pressure and heart rate, significant<br>
negative effects upon the gastro-intestinal tract, and significant effects upon skeletal<br>
muscle). The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are believed to be<br>
safe and effective with regards to prevention and treatment of a wide variety of<br>
conditions and disorders.<br>
The foregoing and other aspects of the present invention are explained in<br>
detail in the detailed description and examples set forth below.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
As used herein, the term "pro-drug" refers to a pharmacologically inactive<br>
form of a compound that undergoes biotransformation prior to exhibiting"its"<br>
pharmacological effect(s). A pro-drug is one that is metabolized in vivo by a subject<br>
after administration into a pharmacologically active form of the compound in order to<br>
produce the desired pharmacological effect. After administration to the subject, the<br>
pharmacologically inactive form of the compound is converted in vivo under the<br>
influence of biological fluids and/or enzymes into a pharmacologically active form of<br>
the compound. Although metabolism occurs for many compounds primarily in the<br>
liver and/or kidney, almost all other tissues and organs, especially the lung, are able to<br>
carry out varying degrees of metabolism. Pro-drug forms of compounds can be<br>
utilized, for example, to improve bioavailability, mask unpleasant characteristics such<br>
as bitter taste, alter solubility for intravenous use, or to provide site-specific delivery<br>
of the compound. Reference to a compound herein includes pro-drug forms of a<br>
compound.<br>
As used herein, "metabolite" refers to a form of a compound thai is the<br>
product of that compound after undergoing a biologically induced transformation. A<br>
metabolite can bo produced synthetically.<br>
As used herein, "N-oxidc" refers to an N-oxide form of a compound wherein<br>
ono or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt form of a<br>
compound that has found acceptance in the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
The compounds of the present invention include compounds of the formula:<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
where each of X and X" is individually nitrogen or carbon bonded to a<br>
substituent species characterized as having a sigma m value in the range of about -0.3<br>
to about 0.75; as determined in accordance with 1 lansch et al., Chem. Rev. 91:165<br>
(1991). As shown in the formula, m is an integer and n is an integer such that the sum<br>
of m plus n is 1,2,3.4,5,6,7, or 8. In one embodiment, the sum of m plus n is 1,2<br>
or 3. Whereas, in another embodiment, the sum of m and n is 2 or 3. The wavy line<br>
in the formula indicates that the compound can have the cis (Z) or trans (E) form. E1,<br>
E11, EU\ Ew, Ev and Evl individually represent hydrogen or lower alkyl (e.g., straight<br>
chain or branched alkyl including C1-C8, for example, C1-C5, such as methyl, ethyl, or<br>
isopiopyl) or halo substituted lower alkyl (e.g., straight chain or branched alkyl<br>
including Ci-Cs, for example, C1-C5, such as trifluoromethyl or trichloromethyl), and<br>
at least one of E1, En, EU1. EW,BV and EV1 is non-hydrogen. Preferably, Ev and/or EVI<br>
is a d1-5 alkyl, more preferably, methyl. Z" and Z" individually represent hydrogen or<br>
lower alkyl (eg., straight chain or branched alkyl including C1-C8, for example C1-C5,<br>
such as methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl). In one embodiment, one of Z" and Z" is<br>
hydrogen. In another embodiment, Z" is hydrogen and Z" is methyl. Alternatively,<br>
Z" is hydrogen and Z" represents a ring structure (cycloalkyl or aromatic), such as, for<br>
example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, adamantyl,<br>
quinuclidinyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl, pyrimidinyl, phenyl, benzyl (where any of the<br>
foregoing can be suitably substituted with at least one substituent group, including<br>
those substituent groups described below with respect to X and X", and particularly<br>
include alkyl, halo, and amino substituents). In addition, Z; Z", and the associated<br>
nitrogen atom alternatively can form a ring structure, such as aziridinyl, azetidinyl,<br>
pyrollidinyl, piperidinyl, quinuclidinyl, piperazinyl, or morpholinyl.<br>
Furthermore, one of Z" and Z" can be -C(=Q) Q", where Q is O, S or NR" and<br>
Q" is OR", SR", N(R")2 or R", where R" is as defined below. More specifically, one of<br>
Z" and Z" can be CH3C(=O)-, -C(=O)OC6H5, -C(=O)N(CH3)2, -C(=S)CH2CH3, -<br>
C(=S)NH2, -C(=S)N(CH3)2, -C(=S)OCH3, or -C(=O)C6H5.<br>
More specifically, X and X" individually can be N, NO, C-H, C-F, C-Cl, C-Br,<br>
C-I, C-R", C-NR"R", C-CF3, C-OH, C-CN, C-NO2, C-C2R", C-SH, C-SCH3, C-N3, C-<br>
SO2CH3, C-OR", C-SR", C-C(=O)NR"R"; C-NR"C(=O)R", C-C(=O)R", C-C(=O)OR;<br>
C(CH2)qOR", C-OC(=O)R; COC(=O)NR"R" and C-NR"C(=O)OR" where R" andR"<br>
are individually hydrogen or lower alkyl (e.g., C1-C10 alkyl, for example, C1-C5 alkyl,<br>
such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or isobutyl), an aromatic group-containing species or<br>
a substituted aromatic group-containing species, and q is an integer from 1 to 6. R"<br>
and R" can be straight chain or branched alkyl, or R" and R" can form a cycloalkyl<br>
functionality (e.g., cyclopropyl cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl,<br>
adamantyl, and quinuclidinyl). Representative aromatic group-containing species<br>
include pyridyl, quinolinyl, pyrimidinyl, phenyl, and benzyl (where any of the<br>
foregoing can be suitably substituted with at least one substituent group, such as alkyl,<br>
halo, or amino substituents). Other representative aromatic ring systems are set forth<br>
in Gibson et al., J. Med. Chem. 39:4065 (1996). When X and X" represent a carbon<br>
atom bonded to a substituent species, that substituent species can have a sigma m<br>
value in the range of about -0.3 to about 0.75, preferably in the range of about -0.25<br>
to about 0.60. In certain circumstances the substituent species is characterized as<br>
having a sigma m value not equal to 0. A, A" and A" individually represent those<br>
species described as substituent species to the aromatic carbon atom previously<br>
described for X and X"; and can include hydrogen, halo (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I), alkyl<br>
(e.g., lower straight chain or branched C1-8 alkyl, such as methyl or ethyl), OR" or<br>
N(R"R"), wherein R" and R" are defined as above. Furthermore, A, A" and A"<br>
individually can be OH. In one embodiment, both A and A" are hydrogen. In other<br>
embodiments, A and A" are hydrogen, and A" is hydroxy, halo, amino, methyl or<br>
ethyl. In yet other embodiments, A, A" and A" are all hydrogen. In one embodiment,<br>
m is 1 or 2, n is 1, E1, En, EnI, E^ and EVI each are hydrogen, andEv is alkyl (e.g.,<br>
methyl).<br>
Depending upon the identity and positioning of each individual E1, En, Em,<br>
E17, Ev and EV1, certain compounds can be optically active. Additionally, compounds<br>
of the present invention can have chiral centers within the alkenyl side chain (e.g., the<br>
compound can have an R or S configuration depending on the selection of Ein, E17, Ev<br>
and E71, with the S configuration being at least one embodiment). Depending upon<br>
E1, En, EUI, EIV, Ev and EVI, compounds of the present invention have chiral centers,<br>
and the present invention relates to racemic mixtures of such compounds as well as<br>
enantiomeric compounds. Typically, the selection of m, n, E1, En, Em, EIV, Ev and<br>
EVI is such that up to about 4, and frequently up to 3, and usually 1 or 2, of the<br>
substituents designated as E1, En, Eui, Eiv, Ev and Evi are non-hydrogen substiruents<br>
(i.e., substituents such as lower alkyl or halo-substituted lower alkyl). Typically, X is<br>
CH, CBr or COR". In the preferred embodiment, X" is nitrogen.<br>
The present invention also encompasses compounds of the formula:<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
where m, E1, En, EIII,E™, X, Z; Z", A, A" and A" are as defined<br>
hereinbefore.<br>

isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
Acyl pro-drug forms can be synthesized by acylation of metanicotine<br>
compounds with appropriate acylating agents. For example, amides can be prepared<br>
by reacting the amine in the metanicotine compound directly with a carboxylic acid,<br>
using a coupling agent, such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), or by reacting the<br>
amine with an activated derivative of the carboxylic acid, such as an acid halide or an<br>
acid anhydride.. Thioamides can be prepared from amides using Lawesson"s reagent.<br>
Ureas can be prepared by reacting the amines in the metanicotinic compounds with<br>
isocyanates. Thioureas can be prepared in a similar fashion using isothiocyanates.<br>
Carbamates can be formed by reacting the amines with haloformates or other<br>
carbonate-like alkoxycarbonyl transfer agents (e.g., di-t-butyl dicarbonate). The<br>
foregoing chemistry is well known to those in the field of organic synthesis.<br>
Ionizable pro-drug compounds can be prepared, which provide water<br>
solubility to pharmaceutically active compounds that would otherwise be only slightly<br>
soluble or insoluble.<br>
In general, the above-identified pro-drug compounds can be synthesized by<br>
carrying out a Heck reaction (as described below) of a substituted bromopyridine or<br>
bromopyrimidine with a pre-formed side chain containing the pro-drug functional<br>
group, to the extent that the side chain is not incompatible with the Heck coupling<br>
chemistry.<br>
The present invention also relates to N-oxide forms of aryl substituted olefinic<br>
amines. The general formula for such compounds includes :<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
wherein X is nitrogen or carbon bonded to a substituent exhibiting a sigma m<br>
value in the range of about -0.3 to about 0.75. For example, X can be selected from<br>
N, NO, C-H, C-F, C-Cl, C-BR, C-I, C-R, C-NR"R", C-CF3, C-OH, C-CN, C-NO2, C-<br>
C2R, C-SH, C-SCH3, C-N3, C-SO2CH3, COR, C-SR", C-C(=O)NR"R", C-<br>
NR"C(=O)R, C-C(=O)R", C-C(=O)OR; C(CH2)q,OR; C-OC(=O)R", COC(=O)NR"R"<br>
and C-NR C(=O)OR; wherein each R and R are as defined above, and wherein q is<br>
an integer from 1 to 6.<br>
The N-oxides of the metanicotines can be synthesized using known<br>
chemistry, for example, by protecting the N-Me functionality via bocylation with di-t-<br>
butyl dicarbonate, oxidizing the pyridine ring nitrogen with meta-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid, and subsequent deprotection (debocylation) with<br>
trifluroacetic acid.<br>
The present invention also includes metabolite forms of aryl substituted<br>
olefinic amines. As indicated previously, the pharmaceutically active forms of the<br>
compounds of the present invention can undergo transformation via biological<br>
processes to form metabolites. The metabolites of the present invention include, for<br>
example, N-dealkylated amine and monohydroxy and dihydroxy forms of the aryl<br>
substituted olefinic amines described herein, wherein the hydroxy groups are present<br>
on the pyridine or pyrimidine rings in the compounds.<br>
Representative monohydroxy metabolite compounds include (4E)-N-methyl-<br>
5-(4-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-5-<br>
pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-<br>
4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-amino-5-methyl-4-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine, (2R)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine,<br>
(2R)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-5-isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-<br>
N-methyl-5-(5-bromo-4-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-<br>
hydroxy-5-ethoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine,(2s-(4E)-N-marhyl-5-(4-hydroxy-<br>
3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, (4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-5-isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-<br>
4-penten-2-amine, and (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-hydroxy-5-isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine. While the compounds listed above include a hydroxy group at the 4-<br>
position of the pyridine ring, it is also contemplated that a hydroxy group can be<br>
present, alternatively or in addition, at the 2 and/or 6 position.<br>
If it is desired to prepare and, optionally, administer compounds which would<br>
ultimately be formed as metabolites in vivo, mono- and dihydroxy pyridines and<br>
pyrimidines can be used as starting materials in the syntheses (described below) of the<br>
aryl-substituted olefinic amines, optionally with protecting groups present on the<br>
hydroxy groups. The optionally added protecting groups can be removed after the<br>
desired synthesis is otherwise complete to provide the desired compounds.<br>
The manner in which aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds of the present<br>
invention are synthetically produced can vary. (E)-metanicotine-type compounds can<br>
be prepared using the techniques set forth by Loffler et al., Chem. Ber.. 42, pp. 3431-<br>
3438 (1909) and Laforge, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 50, p. 2477 (1928) from substituted<br>
nicotine-type compounds. Certain 6-substituted metanicotine-type compounds can be<br>
prepared from the corresponding 6-substituted nicotine-type compounds using the<br>
general methods of Acheson et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1. 2, pp. 579-585<br>
(1980). The requisite precursors for such compounds, 6-substituted nicotine-type<br>
compounds, can be synthesized from 6-substituted nicotinic acid esters using the<br>
general methods disclosed by Rondahl, Acta Pharm. Suec, 14, pp 113-118 (1977).<br>
Preparation of certain 5-substituted metanicotine-type compounds can be<br>
accomplished from the corresponding 5-substituted nicotine-type compounds using<br>
the general method taught by Acheson et al., J. Chem. Soc.. Perkin Trans. 1, 2, pp.<br>
579-585 (1980). The 5-halo-substituted nicotine-type compounds (e.g., fluoro- and<br>
bromo-substituted nicotine-type compounds) and the 5-amino nicotine-type<br>
compounds can be prepared using the general procedures disclosed by Rondahl, Act.<br>
Pharm. Suec, 14, pp. 113-118 (1977). The 5-trifluoromethyl nicotine-type<br>
compounds can be prepared using the techniques and materials set forth in Ashimori<br>
et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull.. 38(9), pp. 2446-2458 (1990) and Rondahl, Acta Pharm.<br>
Suec., 14, pp.113-118 (1977).<br>
Furthermore, certain metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared by the<br>
palladium-catalyzed coupling of an aromatic halide and a terminal olefin containing a<br>
protected amine substituent, removing the protective group to obtain a primary amine,<br>
and optionally alkylating the amine to provide a secondary or tertiary amine. In<br>
particular, certain metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared by subjecting a 3-<br>
halo-substituted, 5-substituted pyridine compound or a 5-halo-substituted pyrimidine<br>
compound to a palladium catalyzed coupling reaction using an olefin possessing a<br>
protected amine functionality (e.g., such an olefin provided by the reaction of a<br>
phthalimide salt with 3-halo-l-propene, 4-halo-l-butene, 5-halo-l-pentene or 6-halo-<br>
1-hexene). See, Frank et al., J. Ore. Chem.. 43(15), pp. 2947-2949 (1978) and<br>
Malek et al., J. Ore. Chem., 47, pp. 5395-5397 (1982). Alternatively, certain<br>
metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared by coupling an N-protected, modified<br>
amino acid residue, such as 4-(N-methyl-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl)aminobutyric acid<br>
methyl ester, with an aryl lithium compound, as can be derived from a suitable aryl<br>
halide and butyl lithium. The resulting N-protected aryl ketone is then chemically<br>
reduced to the corresponding alcohol, converted to the alkyl halide, and subsequently<br>
dehydrohalogenated to introduce the olefin functionality. Removal of the N-<br>
protecting group then affords the desired metanicotine-type compound. Palladium<br>
catalyzed couplings of terminal olefins, described above, typically yield mixtures of<br>
the olefinic isomers (e.g., E and Z and geminally substituted), wherein the (E) isomer<br>
predominates and from which it can be separated by chromatography or<br>
crystallization.<br>
There are a number of different methods for providing (Z)-metanicotine-type<br>
compounds. In one method, (Z)-metanicotine-type compounds can be synthesized<br>
from nicotine-type compounds as a mixture of E and Z isomers; and the (Z)-<br>
metanicotine-type compounds can then be separated by chromatography using the<br>
types of techniques disclosed by Sprouse et al., Abstracts of Papers, p. 32,<br>
Coresta/TCRC Joint Conference (1972). In another method, metanicotine-type<br>
compounds can be prepared by the controlled hydrogenation of the corresponding<br>
acetylenic compound (e.g., an N-methyl-4-(3-pyridinyl)-3-butyn-l-amine type<br>
compound). For example, certain 5-substituted (Z)-metanicotine-type compounds<br>
and certain 6-substituted (Z)-metanicotine-type compounds can be prepared from 5-<br>
substituted-3-pyridinecarboxaldehydes and 6-substituted-3-pyridinecarboxaldehydes,<br>
respectively. Representative synthetic techniques for (Z)-metanicotine-type<br>
compounds are set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,597,919 to Dull et al.<br>
There are a number of methods by which the (Z)-olefinic isomers of aryl<br>
substituted olefinic amine compounds can be synthetically produced. In one approach,<br>
the (Z)-isomers of aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds can be prepared by the<br>
controlled hydrogenation of the corresponding alkynyl compounds (e.g., a N-methyl-<br>
5-(3-pyridyl)-4-butyn-2-amine-type compound) using commercially available Lindlar<br>
catalyst (Aldrich Chemical Company) using the methodology set forth in H. Lindlar<br>
et al., Org. Syn. 46: 89 (1966). The requisite alkynyl compounds can be prepared by<br>
the palladium catalyzed coupling of an aromatic halide, preferably a 3-<br>
bromopyridine-type or a 3-iodopyridine-type compound with an alkynyl side chain<br>
compound (e.g., an N-methyl-4-pentyn-2-amine-type compound). Typically the<br>
methodology set forth in L. Bleicher et al., Synlett. 1115 (1995) is used for the<br>
palladium catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with a monosubstituted alkyne in the<br>
presence of copper(I) iodide and triphenylphosphine and potassium carbonate as a<br>
base. Alkynyl compounds such as N-methyl-4-pentyn-2-amine can be prepared from<br>
commercially available 4-pentyn-2-ol (Aldrich Chemical Company) by treatment with<br>
p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine, followed by reaction of the resulting 4-pentyn-<br>
2-ol p-toluenesulfonate with excess methylamine either as a 40% aqueous solution or<br>
as a 2.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran. In some instances it can be necessary to protect<br>
the amino functionality of the N-methyl-4-pentyn-2-amine-type compound by<br>
treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to give the tert-butoxycarbonyl protected<br>
amine-type compound. Such protected amine compounds can undergo the palladium<br>
catalyzed coupling with aryl halides and the subsequent controlled hydrogenation of<br>
the resulting alkynyl compound more easily than the unprotected amine compounds.<br>
The tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be easily removed using a strong acid<br>
such as trifluoroacetic acid to yield the (Z)-olefinic isomers of aryl substituted olefinic<br>
amine compounds.<br>
The methods by which aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds of the<br>
present invention can be synthetically produced can vary. An olefinic alcohol, such<br>
as 4-penten-2-ol, can be condensed with an aromatic halide, such as 3-bromopyridine<br>
or 3-iodopyridine. Typically, the types of procedures set forth in Frank et al., J. Org.<br>
Chem., 43, pp. 2947-2949 (1978) and Malek et al., J. Ore. Chem., 47, pp. 5395-5397<br>
(1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling of an olefin and an aromatic halide<br>
are used. The olefinic alcohol optionally can be protected as a t-butyldimethylsilyl<br>
ether prior to the coupling. Desilylation then produces the olefinic alcohol. The<br>
alcohol condensation product then is converted to an amine using the type of<br>
procedures set forth in deCosta et al., J. Ore. Chem., 35, pp. 4334-4343 (1992).<br>
Typically, the alcohol condensation product is converted to the aryl substituted<br>
olefinic amine by activation of the alcohol using methanesulfonyl chloride or p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride, followed by mesylate or tosylate displacement using<br>
ammonia, or a primary or secondary amine. Thus, when the amine is ammonia, an<br>
aryl substituted olefinic primary amine compound is provided; when the amine is a<br>
primary amine such as methylamine or cyclobutylamine, an aryl substituted olefinic<br>
secondary amine compound is provided; and when the amine is a secondary amine<br>
such as dimethylamine or pyrrolidine, an aryl substituted olefinic tertiary amine<br>
compound is provided. Other representative olefinic alcohols include 4-penten-l-ol,<br>
5-hexen-2-ol, 5-hexen-3-ol, 3-methyl-3-buten-l-ol, 2-methyl-3-buten-l-ol, 4-methyl-<br>
4-penten-l-ol, 4-methyl-4-penten-2-ol, l-octen-4-ol, 5-methyl-l-hepten-4-ol, 4-<br>
methyl-5-hexen-2-ol, 5-methyl-5-hexen-2-ol, 5-hexen-2-ol and 5-methyl-5-hexen-3-<br>
ol. Trifluoromethyl-substituted olefinic alcohols, such as l,l,l-trifluoro-4-penten-2-<br>
ol, can be prepared from l-ethoxy-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethanol and allyltrimethylsilane<br>
using the procedures of Kubota et al., Tetrahedron Letters. 33(10), pp. 1351-1354<br>
(1992), or from trifluoroacetic acid ethyl esters and allyltributylstannane using the<br>
procedures of Ishihara et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 34(56), pp. 5777-5780 (1993).<br>
Certain olefinic alcohols are optically active, and can be used as enantiomeric<br>
mixtures or as pure enantiomers in order to provide the corresponding optically active<br>
forms of aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds. When an olefinic allylic alcohol,<br>
such as methallyl alcohol, is reacted with an aromatic halide, an aryl substituted<br>
olefinic aldehyde is produced; and the resulting aldehyde can be converted to an aryl<br>
substituted olefinic amine compound by reductive amination (e.g., by treatment using<br>
an alkyl amine and sodium cyanoborohydride). Preferred aromatic halides are 3-<br>
bromopyridine-type compounds and 3-iodopyridine-type compounds. Typically,<br>
substituent groups of such 3-halopyridine-type compounds are such that those groups<br>
can survive contact with those chemicals (e.g., tosylchloride and methylamine) and<br>
the reaction conditions experienced during the preparation of the aryl substituted<br>
olefinic amine compound. Alternatively, substituents such as -OH, -NH2 and -SH can<br>
be protected as corresponding acyl or trialkylsilyl compounds, or substituents such as<br>
-NH2 can be protected as a phthalimide functionality.<br>
The manner in which certain aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds<br>
possessing a branched side chain, such as (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-<br>
4-penten-2-amine, are provided can vary. By using one synthetic approach, the latter<br>
compound can be synthesized in a convergent manner, in which the side chain, N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine is coupled with the 3-substituted 5-<br>
halo-substituted pyridine, 5-bromo-3-isopropoxypyridine, under Heck reaction<br>
conditions, followed by removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group.<br>
Typically, the types of procedures set forth in W. C. Frank et al., J. Org. Chem. 43:<br>
2947 (1978) and N. J. Malek et al., /. Org. Chem. 47: 5395 (1982) involving a<br>
palladium-catalyzed coupling of an olefin and an aromatic halide are used. The<br>
required N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine can be synthesized as<br>
follows: (i) Commercially available 4-penten-2-ol (Aldrich Chemical Company,<br>
Lancaster Synthesis Inc.) can be treated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine to<br>
yield 4-penten-2-ol p-toluenesulfonate, previously described by T. Michel, et al.,<br>
Liebigs Ann. 11: 1811 (1996). (ii) The resulting tosylate can be heated with 20 molar<br>
equivalents of methylamine as a 40% aqueous solution to yield N-methyl-4-penten-2-<br>
amine. (iii) The resulting amine, such as previously mentioned by A. Viola et al., J.<br>
Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. (21): 1429 (1984), can be allowed to react with 1.2<br>
molar equivalents of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in dry tetrahydrofuran to yield the side<br>
chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine. The halo-substituted<br>
pyridine, (e.g., 5-isopropoxy-3-bromopyridine) can be synthesized by two different<br>
routes. In one preparation, 3,5-dibromopyridine is heated at 140°C for 14 hours with 2<br>
molar equivalents of potassium isopropoxide in dry isopropanol in the presence of<br>
copper powder (5%, w/w of the 3,5-dibromopyridine) in a sealed glass tube to yield 5-<br>
isopropoxy-3-bromopyridine. This approach is amenable to use of a variety of sodium<br>
and potassium alkoxides and aryloxides, providing ready access to 5-alkoxy-3-<br>
bromopyridines, 5-cycloalkoxy-3-bromopyridines, 5-phenoxy-3-bromopyridine,<br>
phenyl-substituted 5-phenoxy-3-bromopyridines and 5-fused aryloxy-3-<br>
bromopyridines. A second preparation of 5-isopropoxy-3-bromopyridine from 5-<br>
bromonicotinic acid can be performed as follows: (i) 5-Bromonicotinic acid is<br>
converted to 5-bromonicotinamide by treatment with thionyl chloride, followed by<br>
reaction of the intermediate acid chloride with aqueous ammonia, (ii) The resulting 5-<br>
bromonicotinamide, previously described by C. V. Greco et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem.<br>
7(4): 761 (1970), is subjected to Hoffmann degradation by treatment with sodium<br>
hydroxide and a 70% solution of calcium hypochlorite. (iii) The resulting 3-amino-5-<br>
bromopyridine, previously described by C. V. Greco et al., J. Heteocyclic Chem. 7(4):<br>
761 (1970), can be converted to 5-isopropoxy-3-bromopyridine by diazotization with<br>
isoamyl nitrite under acidic conditions, followed by treatment of the intermediate<br>
diazonium salt with isopropanol. The palladium-catalyzed coupling of 5-isopropoxy-<br>
3-bromopyridine and N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine is carried<br>
out in acetonitrile-triethylamine (2:1, v,v) using a catalyst consisting of 1 mole %<br>
palladium(II) acetate and 4 mole % tri-o-tolylphosphine. The reaction can be carried<br>
out by heating the components at 80°C for 20 hours to yield (4E)-N-methyl-N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-5-(5-isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine. Removal of the tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be accomplished by treatment with 30 molar<br>
equivalents of trifluoroacetic acid in anisole at 0°C to afford (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-<br>
isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
The manner in which certain aryl substituted olefinic amine compounds<br>
possessing a branched side chain are provided can vary. Using one synthetic<br>
approach, a compound such as (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine can be synthesized by coupling a halo-substituted pyridine, 5-bromo-3-<br>
methoxypyridine with an olefin containing a secondary alcohol functionality, 4-<br>
penten-2-ol, under Heck reaction conditions; and the resulting pyridyl alcohol<br>
intermediate can be converted to its p-toluenesulfonate ester, followed by treatment<br>
with methylamine. Typically, the types of procedures set forth in W. C. Frank et al., J.<br>
Org. Chem. 43: 2947 (1978) and N. J. Malek et al., J. Org. Chem. 47: 5395 (1982)<br>
involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling of an olefin and an aromatic halide are<br>
used. The required halo-substituted pyridine, 5-bromo-3-methoxypyridine is<br>
synthesized using methodology similar to that described by H. J. den Hertog et al.,<br>
Recl. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas 74:1171 (1955), namely by heating 3,5-dibromopyridine<br>
with 2.5 molar equivalents of sodium methoxide in dry methanol in the presence of<br>
copper powder (5%, w/w of the 3,5-dibromopyridine) in a sealed glass tube at 150°C<br>
for 14 hours to produce 5-bromo-3-methoxypyridine. The resulting 5-bromo-3-<br>
methoxypyridine, previously described by D. L. Comins, et al., 7. Org. Chem. 55: 69<br>
(1990), can be coupled with 4-penten-2-ol in acetonitrile-triethylamine (1.1:1, v/v)<br>
using a catalyst consisting of 1 mole % palladium(II) acetate and 4 mole % tri-o-<br>
tolylphosphine. The reaction is carried out by heating the components in a sealed<br>
glass tube at 140°C for 14 hours to yield (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-ol. The resulting alcohol is treated with 2 molar equivalents of p-<br>
toluenesulfonyl chloride in dry pyridine at 0°C to produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-<br>
methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-ol p-toluenesulfonate. The tosylate intermediate is<br>
treated with 120-molar equivalents of methylamine as a 40% aqueous solution,<br>
containing a small amount of ethanol as a co-solvent to produce (4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-<br>
methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
The manner in which optically active forms of certain aryl substituted olefinic<br>
amine compounds, such as (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, are<br>
provided can vary. In one synthetic approach, the latter type of compound is<br>
synthesized by coupling a halo-substituted pyridine, 3-bromopyridine, with an olefin<br>
possessing a single enantiomer secondary alcohol functionality, (2R)-4-penten-2-ol,<br>
under Heck reaction conditions. The resulting enantiomerically pure pyridyl alcohol<br>
intermediate, (2R)-(4E)-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-ol is converted to its corresponding<br>
p-toluenesulfonate ester, which is subsequently treated with methylamine, resulting in<br>
tosylate displacement with inversion of configuration. Typically, the types of<br>
procedures set forth in W. C. Frank et al., J. Org. Chem. 43: 2947 (1978) and N. J.<br>
Malek et al., J. Org. Chem. 47: 5395 (1982) involving a palladium-catalyzed coupling<br>
of an aromatic halide and an olefin are used. The enantiomerically pure side chain,<br>
(2R)-4-penten-2-ol can be prepared by treatment of the epoxide, (R)-(+)-propylene<br>
oxide (commercially available from Fluka Chemical Company) with vinylmagnesium<br>
bromide in tetrahydrofuran at low temperatures (-25 to -10°C) using the general<br>
synthetic methodology of A. Kalivretenos, J. K. Stille, and L. S. Hegedus, J. Org.<br>
Chem. 56: 2883 (1991). The Heck reaction of (2R)-4-penten-2-ol with 3-<br>
bromopyridine is carried out in acetonitrile-triethylamine (1:1, v/v) using a catalyst<br>
consisting of 1 mole % palladium(II) acetate and 4 mole % tri-o-tolylphosphine. The<br>
reaction is done by heating the components at 140°C for 14 hours in a sealed glass<br>
tube. The product, (2R)-(4E)-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-ol, is treated with 3 molar<br>
equivalents of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in dry pyridine at 0°C, to afford the tosylate<br>
intermediate. The p-toluenesulfonate ester is heated with 82 molar equivalents of<br>
methylamine as a 40% aqueous solution, containing a small amount of ethanol as a<br>
co-solvent, to produce (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine. In a<br>
similar manner, the corresponding aryl substituted olefinic amine enantiomer, such as<br>
(2R)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine, can be synthesized by the Heck<br>
coupling of 3-bromopyridine and (2S)-4-penten-2-ol. The resulting intermediate,<br>
(2S)-(4E)-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-ol, is converted to its p-toluenesulfonate, which is<br>
subjected to methylamine displacement. The single enantiomer alcohol, (2S)-4-<br>
penten-2-ol, is prepared from (S)-(-)-propylene oxide (commercially available from<br>
Aldrich Chemical Company) using a procedure analogous to that described for the<br>
preparation of (2R)-4-penten-2-ol from (R)-(+)-propylene oxide as reported by A.<br>
Kalivretenos, J. K. Stille, and L. S. Hegedus, /. Org. Chem. 56: 2883 (1991).<br>
The manner in which single enantiomer compounds of the present invention<br>
can be made can vary. The aforementioned olefinic side chain, N-methyl-N-(tert-<br>
butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine, can be produced as either the (R) or the (S)<br>
enantiomer by chemistry similar to that described above. Thus treatment of either<br>
(R)-4-penten-2-ol or (S)-4-penten-2-ol (the syntheses of which were previously<br>
described) with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride produces the corresponding 4-penten-2-ol<br>
p-toluenesulfonate. The tosylate intermediate is treated with 40% aqueous<br>
methylamine and DMF (as co-solvent) to produce either (R)- or (S)-N-methyl-4-<br>
penten-2-amine, by inversion of configuration. Reaction with di-t-butyl dicarbonate<br>
then generates the corresponding (R)- and (S)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine, the palladium catalyzed coupling of which leads to single enantiomer<br>
forms of compounds of the present invention.<br>
The manner in which various hydroxylated compounds of the present<br>
invention (the aforementioned mono- and dihydroxy metabolites of the metanicotines)<br>
can be made can vary. The following schemes are illustrative.<br><br>
Scheme I shows the synthesis of (S)-N-methyl-5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-<br>
pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. In this synthesis, the previously described (S)-N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine is subjected to Heck-type coupling<br>
conditions by reaction with a 2,4-dimethoxy-3-iodopyrirnidine in the presence of a<br>
palladium catalyst to form (S)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(2,4-dimethoxy-<br>
5-pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. The methoxy groups can be converted to hydroxy<br>
groups, concurrent with the cleavage of the amine protecting group, by reaction with<br>
trimethylsilyl iodide in methanol/dichloromethane to yield the desired N-methyl-5-<br>
(2,4-dihydroxy-5-pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine compound as a hydroiodide salt.<br>
Alternately, the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group can be selectively removed by<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, as described previously, to give the (S)-N-methyl-5-(2,4-<br>
dimethoxy-5-pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine. Cleavage of the methyl ethers using<br>
48% HBr then provides (S)-N-methyl-5-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine.<br>
Scheme II shows a similar synthesis for (S)-N-methyl-5-(2-hydroxy-5-<br>
pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine (a monohydroxy metabolite). It illustrates the use of<br>
silyl protecting groups for the hydroxy substituents. Thus, 5-bromo-2-<br>
(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine can be used in a Heck-type coupling reaction with the<br>
aforementioned (S)-N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-amine. The<br>
simultaneous removal of both the silyl and tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups can<br>
be effected by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. This sequence of reactions is<br>
equally applicable to other monohydroxy halopyrimidines.<br>
The present invention also relates to methods for preventing a condition or<br>
disorder in a subject susceptible to such a condition or disorder, and/or for providing<br>
treatment to a subject suffering therefrom, wherein the disorder itself or exhibited<br>
symptoms are effected by the method. For example, the method comprises<br>
administering to a patient an amount of a compound effective for providing some<br>
degree of prevention of the progression of a CNS disorder (i.e., provide protective<br>
effects), amelioration of the symptoms of a CNS disorder, and amelioration of the<br>
recurrence of a CNS disorder. The method involves administering an effective<br>
amount of a compound selected from the general formulae which are set forth<br>
hereinbefore. The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
incorporating a compound selected from the general formulae which are set forth<br>
hereinbefore. Chiral compounds can be employed as racemic mixtures or as single<br>
enantiomers. The compounds can be employed in a free base form or in a salt form<br>
(e.g., as pharmaceutically acceptable salts). Examples of suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include inorganic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride,<br>
hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate; organic acid addition salts such as<br>
acetate, galactarate, propionate, succinate, lactate, glycolate, malate, tartrate, citrate,<br>
maleate, fumarate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and ascorbate; salts with<br>
acidic amino acid such as aspartate and glutamate; alkali metal salts such as sodium<br>
salt and potassium salt; alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium salt and calcium<br>
salt; ammonium salt; organic basic salts such as trimethylamine salt, triethylamine<br>
salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt, dicyclohexylamine salt, and N,N"-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine salt; and salts with basic amino acid such as lysine salt and<br>
arginine salt. The salts can be in some cases hydrates or ethanol solvates.<br>
Representative salts are provided as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,597,919 to Dull et<br>
al., 5,616,716 to Dull et al. and 5,663,356 to Ruecroft et al.<br>
The compounds described herein are useful for treating those types of<br>
conditions and disorders for which other types of nicotinic compounds have been<br>
proposed as therapeutics. See, for example, Williams et al. DN&amp;P 7(4):205-227<br>
(1994), Arneric et al., CNS Drug Rev. 1(1): 1-26 (1995), Arneric et al., Exp. Opin.<br>
Invest. Drugs 5(l):79-100 (1996), Bencherif et al., JPET 279:1413 (1996), Lippiello<br>
et al., JPET 279:1422 (1996), Damaj et al., Neuroscience (1997), Holladay et al., J.<br>
Med. Chem 40(28): 4169-4194 (1997), Bannon et al., Science 279: 77-80 (1998), PCT<br>
WO 94/08992, PCT WO 96/31475, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,583,140 to Bencherif et<br>
al., 5,597,919 to Dull et al., and 5,604,231 to Smith et al. Compounds of the present<br>
invention can be used as analgesics, to treat ulcerative colitis, and to treat convulsions<br>
such as those that are symptomatic of epilepsy. CNS disorders which can be treated<br>
in accordance with the present invention include presenile dementia (early onset<br>
Alzheimer"s disease), senile dementia (dementia of the Alzheimer"s type),<br>
Parkinsonism including Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s chorea, tardive dyskinesia,<br>
hyperkinesia, mania, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, dyslexia, schizophrenia and<br>
Tourette"s syndrome.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition also can include various other components as<br>
additives or adjuncts. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable components or<br>
adjuncts which are employed in relevant circumstances include antioxidants, free<br>
radical scavenging agents, peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostict agent<br>
imrminosuppressives, anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-<br>
pyretics, time release binders, anesthetics, steroids and corticosteroids. Such<br>
components can provide additional therapeutic benefit, act to affect the therapeutic<br>
action of the pharmaceutical composition, or act towards preventing any potential side<br>
effects which can be posed as a result of administration of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition. In certain circumstances, a compound of the present invention can be<br>
employed as part of a pharmaceutical composition with other compounds intended to<br>
prevent or treat a particular disorder.<br>
The manner in which the compounds are administered can vary. The<br>
compounds can be administered by inhalation (e.g., in the form of an aerosol either<br>
nasally or using delivery articles of the type set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,922,901 to<br>
Brooks et al.); topically (e.g., in lotion form); orally (e.g., in liquid form within a<br>
solvent such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or within a solid carrier);<br>
intravenously (e.g., within a dextrose or saline solution); as an infusion or injection<br>
(e.g., as a suspension or as an emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or<br>
mixture of liquids); intrathecally; intracerebroventricularly; or transdermally (e.g.,<br>
using a transdermal patch). Although it is possible to administer the compounds in<br>
the form of a bulk active chemical, it is preferred to present each compound in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation for efficient and effective<br>
administration. Exemplary methods for administering such compounds will be<br>
apparent to the skilled artisan. For example, the compounds can be administered in<br>
the form of a tablet, a hard gelatin capsule or as a time release capsule. As another<br>
example, the compounds can be delivered transdermally using the types of patch<br>
technologies available from Novartis and Alza Corporation. The administration of the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be intermittent, or at a<br>
gradual, continuous, constant or controlled rate to a warm-blooded animal, (e.g., a<br>
mammal such as a mouse, rat, cat, rabbit, dog, pig, cow, or monkey); but<br>
advantageously is preferably administered to a human being. In addition, the time of<br>
day and the number of times per day that the pharmaceutical formulation is<br>
administered can vary. Administration preferably is such that the active ingredients<br>
of the pharmaceutical formulation interact with receptor sites within the body of the<br>
subject that affect the functioning of the CNS. More specifically, in treating a CNS<br>
disorder administration preferably is such so as to optimize the effect upon those<br>
relevant receptor subtypes which have an effect upon the functioning of the CNS,<br>
while minimizing the effects upon muscle-type receptor subtypes. Other suitable<br>
methods for administering the compounds of the present invention are described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,604,231 to Smith et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The appropriate dose of the compound is that amount effective to prevent<br>
occurrence of the symptoms of the disorder or to treat some symptoms of the disorder<br>
from which the patient suffers. By "effective amount", "therapeutic amount" or<br>
"effective dose" is meant that amount sufficient to elicit the desired pharmacological<br>
or therapeutic effects, thus resulting in effective prevention or treatment of the<br>
disorder. Thus, when treating a CNS disorder, an effective amount of compound is an<br>
amount sufficient to pass across the blood-brain barrier of the subject, to bind to<br>
relevant receptor sites in the brain of the subject, and to activate relevant nicotinic<br>
receptor subtypes (e.g., provide neurotransmitter secretion, thus resulting in effective<br>
prevention or treatment of the disorder). Prevention of the disorder is manifested by<br>
delaying the onset of the symptoms of the disorder. Treatment of the disorder is<br>
manifested by a decrease in the symptoms associated with the disorder or an<br>
amelioration of the recurrence of the symptoms of the disorder. Relative to (E)-<br>
metanicotine, compounds of the present invention are less extensively metabolized<br>
(i.e., fewer metabolites are formed, and the rate of elimination from blood is slower)<br>
in mammalian systems. This is particularly true in those embodiments where Ev<br>
and/or EVI is C1-5 alkyl, preferably methyl. As such, as compared to (E)-metanicotine,<br>
compounds of the present invention are capable of providing higher absolute plasma<br>
concentrations, and are capable of being maintained within a mammalian system for<br>
longer periods of time. Thus, compounds of the present invention are capable of<br>
providing comparable therapeutic effects of (E)-metanicotine at low doses.<br>
The effective dose can vary, depending upon factors such as the condition of<br>
the patient, the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, and the manner in which the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is administered. For human patients, the effective dose<br>
of typical compounds generally requires administering the compound in an amount<br>
sufficient to activate relevant receptors to effect neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine)<br>
release but the amount should be insufficient to induce effects on skeletal muscles and<br>
ganglia to any significant degree. The effective dose of compounds will of course<br>
differ from patient to patient but in general includes amounts starting where CNS<br>
effects or other desired therapeutic effects occur, but below the amount where<br>
muscular effects are observed.<br>
Typically, the effective dose of compounds generally requires administering<br>
the compound in an amount of less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. Often, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are administered in an amount from 1 mg to less<br>
than 100 ug/kg of patient weight, frequently between about 10 ug to less than 100<br>
ug/kg of patient weight, and preferably between about 10 ug to about 50 ug/kg of<br>
patient weight. For compounds of the present invention that do not induce effects on<br>
muscle type nicotinic receptors at low concentrations, the effective dose is less than 5<br>
mg/kg of patient weight; and often such compounds are administered in an amount<br>
from 50 ug to less than 5 mg/kg of patient weight. The foregoing effective doses<br>
typically represent that amount administered as a single dose, or as one or more doses<br>
administered over a 24 hour period.<br>
For human patients, the effective dose of typical compounds generally<br>
requires administering the compound in an amount of at least about 1, often at least<br>
about 10, and frequently at least about 25 ug/ 24 hr./ patient. For human patients, the<br>
effective dose of typical compounds requires administering the compound which<br>
generally does not exceed about 500, often does not exceed about 400, and frequently<br>
does not exceed about 300 ug/ 24 hr./ patient. In addition, administration of the<br>
effective dose is such that the concentration of the compound within the plasma of the<br>
patient normally does not exceed 500 ng/ml, and frequently does not exceed 100<br>
ng/ml.<br>
The compounds useful according to the method of the present invention have<br>
the ability to pass across the blood-brain barrier of the patient. As such, such<br>
compounds have the ability to enter the central nervous system of the patient. The log<br>
P values of typical compounds, which are useful in carrying out the present invention<br>
are generally greater than about 0, often are greater than about 0.5, and frequently are<br>
greater than about 1. The log P values of such typical compounds generally are less<br>
than about 3.5, often are less than about 3, and sometimes are less than about 2.5.<br>
Log P values provide a measure of the ability of a compound to pass across a<br>
diffusion barrier, such as a biological membrane. See, Hansch, et al., J. Med. Chem.<br>
11:1 (1968).<br>
The compounds useful according to the method of the present invention have<br>
the ability to bind to, and in most circumstances, cause activation of, nicotinic<br>
cholinergic receptors of the brain of the patient (e.g., such as those receptors that<br>
modulate dopamine release). As such, such compounds have the ability to express<br>
nicotinic pharmacology, and in particular, to act as nicotinic agonists. The receptor<br>
binding constants of typical compounds useful in carrying out the present invention<br>
generally exceed about 0.1 nM, often exceed about 1 nM, and frequently exceed about<br>
10 nM. The receptor binding constants of such typical compounds generally are less<br>
than about 1 uM, often are less than about 100 nM, and frequently are less than about<br>
50 nM. Receptor binding constants provide a measure of the ability of the compound<br>
to bind to half of the relevant receptor sites of certain brain cells of the patient. See,<br>
Cheng, et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22:3099 (1973).<br>
The compounds useful according to the method of the present invention have<br>
the ability to demonstrate a nicotinic function by effectively eliciting ion flux through,<br>
and/or neurotransmitter secretion from, nerve ending preparations (e.g., thalamic or<br>
striatal synaptosomes). As such, such compounds have the ability to cause relevant<br>
neurons to become activated, and to release or secrete acetylcholine, dopamine, or<br>
other neurotransmitters. Generally, typical compounds useful in carrying out the<br>
present invention effectively provide for relevant receptor activation in amounts of at<br>
least about 30 percent, often at least about 50 percent, and frequently at least about 75<br>
percent, of that maximally provided by (S)-(-)-nicotine. Generally, typical compounds<br>
useful in carrying out the present invention are more potent than (S)-(-)-nicotine in<br>
eliciting relevant receptor activation. Generally, typical compounds useful in carrying<br>
out the present invention effectively provide for the secretion of dopamine in amounts<br>
of at least about 50 percent, often at least about 75 percent, and frequently at least<br>
about 100 percent, of that maximally provided by (S)-(-)-nicotine. Certain<br>
. compounds of the present invention can provide secretion of dopamine in an amount<br>
which can exceed that maximally provided by (S)-(-)-nicotine. Generally, typical<br>
compounds useful in carrying out the present invention are less potent than (S)-(-)-<br>
nicotine in eliciting neurotransmitter secretion, such as dopamine secretion.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts<br>
in accordance with the method of the present invention, lack the ability to elicit<br>
activation of nicotinic receptors of human muscle to any significant degree. In that<br>
regard, the compounds of the present invention demonstrate poor ability to cause<br>
isotopic rubidium ion flux through nicotinic receptors in cell preparations expressing<br>
muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Thus, such compounds exhibit<br>
receptor activation constants or EC50 values (i.e., which previde a measure of the<br>
concentration of compound needed to activate half of the relevant receptor sites of the<br>
skeletal muscle of a patient) which are extremely high (i.e., greater than about 100<br>
uM). Generally, typical preferred compounds useful in carrying the present invention<br>
activate isotopic rubidium ion flux by less than 10 percent, often by less than 5<br>
percent, of that maximally provided by S(-) nicotine.<br>
The compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts<br>
in accordance with the method of the present invention, are selective to certain<br>
relevant nicotinic receptors, but do not cause significant activation of receptors<br>
associated with undesirable side effects. By this is meant that a particular dose of<br>
compound resulting in prevention and/or treatment of a CNS disorder, is essentially<br>
ineffective in eliciting activation of certain ganglionic-type nicotinic receptors. This<br>
selectivity of the compounds of the present invention against those receptors<br>
responsible for cardiovascular side effects is demonstrated by a lack of the ability of<br>
those compounds to activate nicotinic function of adrenal chromaffin tissue. As<br>
such, such compounds have poor ability to cause isotopic rubidium ion flux through<br>
nicotinic receptors in cell preparations derived from the adrenal gland. Generally,<br>
typical preferred compounds useful in carrying out the present invention activate<br>

maximally provided by S(-) nicotine.<br>
Compounds of the present invention, when employed in effective amounts in<br>
accordance with the method of the present invention, are effective towards providing<br>
some degree of prevention of the progression of CNS disorders, amelioration of the<br>
symptoms of CNS disorders, and amelioration to some degree of the recurrence of<br>
CNS disorders. However, such effective amounts of those compounds are not<br>
sufficient to elicit any appreciable side effects, as is demonstrated by decreased<br>
effects on preparations believed to reflect effects on the cardiovascular system, or<br>
effects to skeletal muscle. As such, administration of compounds of the present<br>
invention provides a therapeutic window in which treatment of certain CNS disorders<br>
is provided, and side effects are avoided. That is, an effective dose of a compound of<br>
the present invention is sufficient to provide the desired effects upon the CNS, but is<br>
insufficient (i.e., is not at a high enough level) to provide undesirable side effects.<br>
Preferably, effective administration of a compound of the present invention resulting<br>
in treatment of CNS disorders occurs upon administration of less 1/3, frequently less<br>
than 1/5, and often less than 1/10, that amount sufficient to cause any side effects to a<br>
significant degree.<br>

dropwise addition of water (0.5 mL). The solution was filtered while hot to remove<br>
some insoluble material. The filtrate was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The<br>
resulting crystals were filtered, washed with anhydrous diethyl ether, and dried under<br>
vacuum at 40°C to yield 1.20 g (47.0%) of a white, crystalline powder, mp 148-<br>

Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 5-bromonicotinic acid (10.10 g, 50.00 mmol)<br>
was dissolved in thionyl chloride (65.24 g, 0.55 mol), and the resulting solution was<br>
stirred 45 min at ambient temperature. Excess thionyl chloride was removed by<br>
distillation, and the residue was dried under high vacuum. The resulting solid was<br>
ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle under a nitrogen atmosphere and quickly<br>
added to a 28% solution of aqueous ammonia at 0°C. The mixture was stirred briefly<br>
at 0°C and then at ambient temperature for 3 h. The crude product was filtered, dried,<br>
and recrystallized from toluene-ethanol (1:1, v/v) to give 6.92 g (68.9%) of 5-<br>
bromonicotinamide, mp 210-213°C (lit. mp 219-219.5°C, see C. V. Greco et al., /.<br>
Heteocyclic Chem. 7(4): 761 (1970)).<br>
3-Amino-5-bromopyridine<br>
Sodium hydroxide (2.50 g, 62.50 mmol) was added to a cold (0°C), stirring<br>
suspension of calcium hypochlorite solution (1.53 g, 7.50 mmol of 70% solution) in<br>
water (35 mL). The mixture was stirred 15 min at 0°C and filtered. The clarified<br>
filtrate was cooled and stirred in an ice-salt bath while 5-bromonicotinamide (3.03 g,<br>
15.1 mmol) was added in one portion. The suspension was stirred 2 h at 0°C, warmed<br>
to ambient temperature, and heated on a steam bath for 1 h. After cooling, the mixture<br>
was extracted with CHCI3 (2 x 50 mL). The combined CHCI3 extracts were dried<br>
(Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator producing 1.42 g of a<br>
light-yellow solid. The aqueous layer was adjusted to pH 8 with 6M HC1 solution and<br>
extracted with CHCI3 (2 x 50 mL). The combined CHCI3 extracts were dried<br>
(Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, affording 0.98 g of a<br>
brown solid. Based upon TLC analysis (toluene-ethanol (3:1, v/v)), both crude<br>
products were combined to give 2.40 g which was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) and<br>
filtered to remove a small amount of a light-yellow solid (80 mg, mp 225-227°C). The<br>
filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residue was dissolved in 2-<br>
propanol (6 mL), filtered, and cooled to 5°C. The resulting precipitate was filtered and<br>
dried to give a small amount of a tan solid (65 mg, mp 63-64°C). The filtrate was<br>
concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residue was dissolved in toluene (5 mL),<br>
assisted by heating, and cooled to 5°C. The resulting precipitate was filtered and dried<br>

tan solid. The solid was slurried in 2-propanol (25 mL), and treated with isoamyl<br>
nitrite (1.70 g, 15.00 mmol). The mixture was stirred and heated under reflux for 1.5<br>
h. The solution was concentrated by rotary evaporation, and the residue was<br>
partitioned between diethyl ether and 1M NaOH solution. The aqueous layer was<br>
separated and extracted with ether. The combined ether extracts were dried (Na2SO4),<br>
filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation producing an orange oil (2.03 g). The<br>
oil was purified by vacuum distillation, collecting the fraction with bp 105-115°C at 9<br>

concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting solids were triturated with<br>
anhydrous diethyl ether (3x6 mL). The product was dried under a stream of nitrogen,<br>
dried under high vacuum, followed by further vacuum drying at 45°C for 15 h to<br>

mmol) in anisole (2.5 mL) was treated drop-wise with trifluoroacetic acid (2.5 mL,<br>
32.5 mmol) over 3 min. The resulting light-yellow solution was allowed to stir for 45<br>
min at 0-5°C and was then concentrated by rotary evaporation using a 70°C water<br>
bath. The resulting liquid was vacuum dried at 0.5 mm Hg for 16 h to produce a<br>
light-yellow oil (302.5 mg). The oil was basified at 0-5°C with 1 M NaOH solution<br>
(2 mL), followed by treatment with saturated NaCl solution (2 mL). The mixture was<br>
extracted with CHCl3 (14 x 5 mL). The combined CHCl3 extracts were dried<br>
(Na2SO4), filtered, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and vacuum dried to give<br>
143.8 mg (quantitative yield) of a brown, syrupy semi-solid (Rf 0.23 in CH3OH-Et3N<br>
(97:3, v/v)).<br>
Sample No. 12 exhibits a Ki of 5900 nM. The binding constant indicates that<br>
the compound exhibits binding to certain CNS nicotinic receptors. The sample<br>
exhibits a neurotransmitter release "Emax value of 9%.<br>
Sample No. 12 exhibits an Emax of 0% (at a concentration of 100 uM) at<br>
muscle-type receptors, indicating that the compound does not induce activation of<br>
muscle-type receptors. The sample exhibits an Emax of 8% (at a concentration of 100<br>
uM) at ganglionic-type receptors. The compound has the capability to activate human<br>
CNS receptors without activating muscle-type and ganglionic-type nicotinic<br>
acetylcholine receptors to any significant degree. Thus, there is provided a<br>
therapeutic window for utilization in the treatment of CNS disorders. That is, at<br>
certain levels the compound shows CNS effects to a significant degree but do not<br>
show undesirable muscle or ganglion effects to any significant degree.<br>

(4E)-5-(5-Isopropoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (112 mg, 0.508 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in methanol (2.5 mL) and treated with galactaric acid (53 mg, 0.25 mmol)<br>
and water (0.20 mL). The mixture was warmed slightly, filtered through a glass wool<br>
plug and cooled slowly to 0° C, at which temperature it remained for 48 h. Vacuum<br>
filtration and vacuum oven drying (40° C, 24 h) gave 53 mg of white solid (mp 171.5-<br>
173.5° C). Second and third crops of 50 mg and 5 mg (mp 170-173° C and 169-172°<br>

EXAMPLE 20<br>
Sample No. 14 is (4E)-N-methyl-5-(6-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine<br>
oxalate, which was prepared in accordance with the following techniques:<br>
(4E)-N-Methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(6-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-<br>
penten-2-amine<br>
A 185 mL Ace-Glass pressure tube was charged with 5-bromo-2-<br>
methoxypyridine (2.80 g, 14.9 mmol), N-methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine (2.97 g, 14.9 mmol), prepared as previously described, palladium(II) acetate<br>
(33.4 mg, 0.149 mmol), tri-o-tolylphosphine (181 mg, 0.596 mmol), triethylamine (5<br>
mL) and acetonitrile (10 mL). The tube was flushed with nitrogen, sealed, and the<br>
mixture was stirred and heated at 95°C (oil bath temperature) for 18 h. The tube<br>
contents were cooled; more palladium(II) acetate (33.4 mg, 0.149 mmol) and tri-o-<br>
tolylphosphine (181 mg, 0.596 mmol) were added. The mixture was further stirred<br>
and heated at 94°C for 20 h. TLC analysis (hexane-ethyl acetate (2:1)) indicated the<br>
presence of 5-bromo-2-methoxypyridine. Therefore, more palladium(II) acetate (33.4<br>
mg, 0.149 mmol) and tri-o-tolylphosphine (181 mg, 0.596 mmol) were added, and the<br>
mixture was heated at 95°C for an additional 20 h. The mixture was cooled and<br>
concentrated via rotary evaporator. The residue was diluted with water (35 mL) and<br>
extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL, 2 x 35 mL). The combined dichloromethane<br>
extracts were dried (Na2So4), filtered, and concentrated under vacuum to produce a<br>
light-brown, oily semisolid (5.61 g). The crude product was purified by column<br>
chromatography on silica gel (70-230 mesh) (200 g) eluting with a hexane-ethyl<br>
acetate gradient (64:1 ? 6:1). Fractions containing the product (Rf 0.28 in hexane-<br>
ethyl acetate (6:1)) were combined and concentrated under vacuum to give 2.36 g of<br>
an oily, yellow semisolid. Impure fractions were combined and concentrated to give<br>
1.48 g of a light-yellow oil. This material was re-chromatographed on the silica gel<br>
(70-230 mesh) (95 g) eluting with the previously described hexane-ethyl acetate<br>
gradient (64:1 ? 6:1). All fractions containing the product were combined and<br>
concentrated under vacuum to give 0.85 g of a light-yellow oil, bringing the total<br>
yield to 2.915 (63.9%).<br>
(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(6-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine<br>
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a cold (0-5°C), stirring solution of (4E)-N-<br>
methyl-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-5-(6-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine(2.90g,<br>
9.45 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) wajs treated drop-wise over 15 min with<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (15 mL). After stirring for 30 min, the solution was concentrated<br>
to a yellow-orange oil. The residue was diluted with saturated aqueous NaCl solution<br>
(15 mL), cooled to 0-5°C, and basified with 10% aqueous NaOH solution (22 mL).<br>
The mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (5 x 25 mL). The combined CHCl3 extracts<br>
were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under vacuum to give a light-yellow<br>
oil (1.88 g). The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel<br>
(70-230 mesh) (150 g), eluting with a CH3OH-NH4OH step-wise gradient (100:1 -»¦<br>
15:1 in increments of 25:1). Fractions containing the product (Rf 0.28 in CHCl3-<br>
CE3OH-Et3N (50:1:1)) were kept separate from those containing an impurity (Rf<br>
0.35) and were combined and concentrated to give 0.76 g of a light-yellow oil.<br>
Impure fractions were combined and concentrated to give 1.20 g of light-yellow oil.<br>
The latter material was re-chromatographed on a new silica gel column (75 g) using<br>
the same CH3OH-NH4OH gradient elution protocol. Impure fractions were combined<br>
and concentrated to give 1.08 g of light-yellow oil. The latter material was re-<br>
chromatographed (6 times) on a new silica gel columns (45 g and 25 g) using CHCl3-<br>
CH3OH-Et3N step-wise gradient (16:1 —^ 1:1 in CHCl3-CH3OH, with each gradient<br>
step containing 1 % Et^N). All fractions containing the product were combined and<br>
concentrated under vacuum to give 1.368 g (70.2%) of a light-yellow oil.<br>
(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(6-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine<br>
(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(6-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (0.385 g, 1.86<br>
mmol) was dissolved in 48% HBr (30 mL), and the solution was heated at vigorous<br>
reflux (120-130°C) for 17 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated by rotary<br>
evaporation to ~5mL volume and then neutralized with saturated aqueous NaHCO3.<br>
The mixture was evaporated, leaving 1.49 g of a mixture of salts and the desired<br>
product. This was placed on a silica gel column (32 g), which was eluted with 50:1<br>
methanol/aqueous ammonia. Concentration of selected fractions gave 0.264 g of light<br>
brown viscous oil. GCMS analysis indicated that the sample was 91% desired<br>
material (67% corrected yield).<br>
(4E)-N-MethyI-5-(6-hydroxy-3-pyridyI)-4-penten-2-amineoxalate<br>
(4E)-N-Methyl-5-(6-hydroxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (0.263 g of 91%,<br>
1.23 mmol) was dissolved in warm absolute ethanol (3 mL) and combined with oxalic<br>
acid (0.110 g, 1.23 mmol) in warm absolute ethanol (4.5 mL). The solution was<br>
cooled at 4°C for 1 h, during which time an oily material was deposited. The ethanol<br>
was evaporated to leave a dark brown oil, which was combined with 2-propanol (3<br>
mL). This mixture (heterogeneous) was refluxed as absolute ethanol was added drop-<br>
wise. Once homogeneous, the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature as the<br>
walls of the flask were scratched with a spatula. A tan precipitate formed. The<br>
mixture was kept at 4°C overnight and filtered. The filter cake was washed with cold<br>
2-propanol and vacuum dried (40°C) for 48 h. The resulting tan powder weighed<br>
0.248 g (71% yield), mp 174-175.5°C.<br>
Sample No. 14 exhibits a Ki of 32.5 µM.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Sample No. 15 is (4E)-5-(5-pyrimidinyl)-4-penten-2-amine hydrochloride,<br>
which was prepared in accordance with the following scheme:<br><br>
(R) - Propylene oxide was reacted with vinyl magnesium chloride to form (S)-<br>
pent-l-ene-4-oxide (as the magnesium chloride salt), which was tosylated (tosyl = p-<br>
toluene sulfonyl) to form the tosylated intermediate (S)-pent-l-ene-4-ol tosylate. The<br>
tosylate group was then displaced with phthalimide. The resulting phthalimidated<br>
intermediate was reacted with 5-bromopyrimidine in the presence of a palladium<br>
catalyst in a Heck-type coupling reaction. The phthalimide protecting group was then<br>
removed by reaction with hydrazine and hydrochloric acid to yield the free amine as<br>
the hydrochloride salt.<br>
Each of the publications and patents described herein is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference for all purposes. The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention<br>
and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. The invention is defined by the<br>
following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
Sample No. 16 is (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine.<br>
A racemic mixture that includes (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-pentene-<br>
2-amine and the structurally related (2R) analog was described in Example 14. The racemic<br>
mixture bound to the a4ß2 receptor with extremely high affinity (22 nM). However, in order to<br>
optimize the compound, the individual stereoisomeric forms of (4E)-N-methyl-4-(5-methoxy-3-<br>
pyridyl)-3-penten-2-amine were prepared to determine whether either form had significantly<br>
improved properties relative to the other form, or to the racemic mixture. While the racemic<br>
mixture had a Ki of 22 nM, the (2S) isomer had a Ki of 7 nM. Based on the significantly better .<br>
Ki value of the (2S)-enantiomer relative to the racemic mixture (roughly 300% improvement),<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-pentene-2-amine was subjected to animal trials<br>
(pre-clinical trials). Information on the animal trials, specifically related to the treatment of pain,<br>
is provided below.<br>
In order for compounds to be useful as non-opioid analgesics, they must bind tightly and<br>
selectively to the relevant receptor (a4ß2), and, once bound, act as an agonist at the receptor (as<br>
evidenced by dopamine release). Such compounds ideally also show antinociceptive efficacy<br>
when administered subcutaneously and/or orally, not result in tolerance, and demonstrate<br>
antihyperalgesic effects. Further, desired compounds are not mutagenic, do not significantly<br>
accumulate in the body, are rapidly absorbed, and easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Of the<br>
compounds tested, (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine best met<br>
these criteria.<br>
The compound was in receptor binding studies. The Ki at a4ß2 was determined with<br>
[3H]nicotine in rat cortical membranes, and the Ki at a7 was determined with [3H]MLA in rat<br>
hippocampal membranes. [3H]Dopamine release was assessed in rat striatal synaptosomes<br>
(a4ß2/a6/a3ß2 pharmacology). The response at human muscle nAChR was assessed by<br>
rubidium ion efflux in TE671 cells. The response at the rat and human ganglion nAChR (a3ß4)<br>
was assessed by rubidium ion efflux in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells, respectively.<br>
The data showed that the compound is extremely selective for a4ß2 over a7 nAChR, with<br>
a binding affinity at a4ß2 of 7 nM, and a binding affinity at a7 of over 100 uM. Thus, the<br>
compound has one of the highest binding affinities for the a4ß2 receptor of any known<br>
compound, while having a significantly different binding affinity for the a7 receptor. The<br>
compound also demonstrated full agonist activity in eliciting DA release in striatum, with an<br>
EC50 of 378 nM, but does not activate muscle or ganglion nAChRs, two subtypes associated with<br>
side effects, at effective analgesic dosages. Accordingly, the compound is capable of selectively<br>
eliciting CNS effects without being significantly associated with unwanted side effects1" at the<br>
muscle and ganglion.<br>
The compound was subjected to preliminary drug safety studies using a broad profile<br>
screen assessing receptors, enzymes, and transporters for general side effects. The data showed<br>
that the compound, at a concentration of 10 mM, resulted in 
those endpoints) &gt; 100 times its Ki at a4ß2 nAChRs (the targeted pharmacology). A single-<br>
concentration assessment of the effects of the compound at 10 mM on human ether-a-go-go-<br>
related gene (hERG) K+-currents also demonstrated minimal inhibition.<br>
The compound"s antinociceptive properties were evaluated using generally accepted<br>
animal models. The animal models included the plantar withdrawal test in rats, and the hot plate<br>
test in mice.<br>
When administered subcutaneously, the compound produced acute analgesic effects in<br>
plantar withdrawal test in rats. The analgesic efficacy was comparable to that of nicotine in the<br>
rat plantar withdrawal test. Response latency following administration of the compound (0.62<br>
mg/kg; s.c.) was blocked by 3 mg/kg of the non-competitive nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine,<br>
indicating a nAChR mechanism of action.<br>
Subcutaneous administration of the compound also produced analgesic effects in mice, as<br>
demonstrated by a hot plate test in mice. The compound caused thermal antinociception in a hot<br>
plate test after acute subcutaneous administration. A significant increase in response latency<br>
efficaciously equal to that of morphine was observed in only 5 minutes following the<br>
administration of the compound, compared to 15 minutes following morphine treatment.<br>
Oral administration of the compound produced analgesic effects in mice up to 60 minutes<br>
after administration. A time course / dose response assessment of the compound, administered<br>
orally, in the hot plate test showed that the reaction latency to thermal pain in the mouse was<br>
significantly increased 5 minutes following administration of the compound, depending on dose,<br>
and subsequently followed that of morphine for the time points assessed.<br>
The compound was then evaluated to determine whether chronic administration would<br>
result in tolerance to its analgesic effects. Chronic (14-day) treatment with the compound did not<br>
result in tolerance to its analgesic effects. The reaction latency to thermal pain stimulus in the rat<br>
plantar withdrawal test on day 14 was either the same or increased compared to day 1 (acute)<br>
following oral administration. This demonstrates a significant improvement" over opioid .<br>
analgesics, the dosage of which must be increased over time due to tolerance that develops on<br>
chronic administration.<br>
The compound was evaluated to determine whether there would be any locomotor<br>
sensitization to the compound following acute and chronic administration. There was no<br>
locomotor sensitization to the compound (s.c.) following acute (day 1) and chronic (day 14)<br>
administration. Unlike nicotine (0.5 mg/kg; s.c), total activity (horizontal counts + vertical<br>
counts) over a 90 minute period (mean ± SEM) following administration of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-<br>
5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (1.9 or 6.2 mg/kg; s.c.) was not increased over the<br>
course of a chronic (14-day) administration regimen.<br>
The antihyperalgesic effects of the compound were evaluated using a carrageenan-<br>
induced inflammatory model and a chronic constriction injury induced neuropathic pain model.<br>
Following inflammation injury induced by carrageenan administration to the plantar surface of<br>
the hind paw, animals treated with (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-<br>
amine (30 mg/kg) showed a significantly increased nociceptive threshold (paw pressure)<br>
compared with vehicle treated animals, and comparable oral efficacy compared with<br>
indomethacin. Following chronic constriction injury (Bennett model), rats treated with (2S)-<br>
(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (30 mg/kg; p.o.) showed a<br>
significantly increased nociceptive threshold compared with vehicle treated animals and had oral<br>
potency / efficacy comparable to morphine.<br>
The safety of the compound was evaluated by reviewing its mutagenicity, via single dose<br>
and 14- and 28-day sub-acute studies. There was no evidence of mutagenicity in any of the 3<br>
definitive in vitro or in vivo bioassays. The acute toxicity of (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-<br>
3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine in 3 animal models via 2 routes of administration followed a<br>
predictable and anticipated pattern based on its receptor selectivity. "No effect doses" in the<br>
mouse and rat after single oral administration were 10 and 12.5 respectively, and 1 and 0.3 mg/kg<br>
in the rat and dog respectively, after i.v. • administration There were no remarkable<br>
histopathology findings in the mouse or rat at doses as high as 150 and 200 mg/kg, respectively,<br>
and in the dog as high as 30 mg/kg. There was no evidence of GI toxicity. There was some<br>
increased bradycardia and BP in dogs at a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg and higher, but this effect<br>
was not observed when evaluated in repeat dose sub-acute studies. There were no ocular changes<br>
and ECGs and gross necropsy were normal at all dose levels in the 28-day studies.<br>
The compound was next evaluated to measure its absorption and its ability to cross the<br>
blood-brain barrier. Pharmacokinetic parameters were measured in rats orally dosed at 10 mg/kg<br>
and sampled up to 24 hours after administration, or mice orally dosed with 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg<br>
(2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine (p.o.) and sampled at 30 minutes<br>
after administration. The data showed that the compound was rapidly absorbed and easily crossed<br>
the blood-brain barrier.<br>
Toxicokinetic parameters were evaluated in rats orally dosed with 20, 60 or 200 mg/kg of<br>
the compound in a 28-day sub-acute study. The data showed that plasma concentrations were<br>
dose proportional and showed no trend toward accumulation over repeated dosing.<br>
Toxicokinetic evaluation in the sub-acute rat and dog studies demonstrated (2S)-(4E)-N-methyl-<br>
5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-amine to be rapidly absorbed, have peak plasma levels at 1<br>
to 4 hours, dose proportionality, similar Cmax / AUCs for males and females, and displayed no<br>
evidence of significant accumulation.<br>
Summary of Findings<br>
In summary, the compound does not significantly interact with a7, muscle or ganglionic<br>
(a3ß4) nAChRs. It demonstrates agonist activity in eliciting dopamine (DA) release from<br>
striatum. It is effective in various animal models of analgesia and hyperalgesia/allodynia, and is<br>
orally active, both acutely and chronically. The potency in animal models of<br>
analgesia/hyperalgesia is comparable to (or greater than) that of morphine and indomethacin.<br>
Analgesia is reversed by the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine, providing evidence of the<br>
compound"s nAChR mechanism of action. There is no evidence of locomotor sensitization or<br>
mutagenicity, and the compound shows rapid oral absorption with good plasma/brain ratio.<br>
There is no evidence of significant accumulation over a 28-day sub-acute study. Many side<br>
effects observed in safety and "acute" studies are no longer observed following sub-acute dosing<br>
in 14- and 28-day studies, and there was no GI toxicity observed even after repeated<br>
administration in toxicology studies. There were no major histopathologic alterations, even at<br>
high oral doses, in the 28-day rat and dog studies.<br>
The non-clinical pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and safety profile of (2S)-(4E)-N-<br>
methyl-5-(5-methoxy-3-pyridyl)-4-penten-2-araine is believed to provide the first example of a<br>
comparatively well-tolerated, potent, and efficacious neuronal nicotinic modulator that holds<br>
promise for the management of nociception.<br>
