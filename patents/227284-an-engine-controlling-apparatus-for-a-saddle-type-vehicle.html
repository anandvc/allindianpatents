				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an engine controlling<br>
apparatus for a saddle type vehicle, such as a two-wheeled<br>
vehicle or a three-wheeled vehicle, which is straddled by a<br>
driver for driving thereof and, particularly to a control<br>
operation to be performed when an engine once brought in an idle<br>
stop state is restarted in response to detection of a<br>
predetermined idle stop cancellation condition.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art.<br>
Idle stop systems are known, which improve energy saving by<br>
stopping an engine (driving source) of a motor vehicle if a<br>
predetermined vehicle stop condition is satisfied during driving<br>
of the motor vehicle, and restarting the engine if a<br>
predetermined restoration condition is satisfied during the<br>
engine stop. In an idle stop system disclosed in Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Publication [KOKAI] No. 11-257123 (1999), for<br>
example, the engine is restarted in response to an accelerating<br>
operation performed during the engine stop. More specifically,<br>
an engine start command is output when an	<br><br><br>
increase in accelerator opening degree (throttle opening<br>
degree) by the accelerating operation (throttle up<br>
operation) performed by a driver is detected.<br>
With this arrangement, however, the time required<br>
for the restart of the engine to start the motor vehicle<br>
is not sufficientlyshort to satisfya demand of the driver.<br>
Particularly in the case of a saddle type vehicle such<br>
as a two-wheeled vehicle, the driver starts the vehicle<br>
simply by unbraking the vehicle and operating an<br>
accelerator grip, and often wants to more speedily start<br>
the vehicle. Therefore, even if the idle stop system of<br>
the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI)No.<br>
11-257123 is applied to the saddle type vehicle, it is<br>
impossible to provide vehicle start timing desired by<br>
the driver, failing to provide excellent driving comfort.<br>
With the arrangement disclosed in the patent<br>
publication, it is necessary to detect the throttle<br>
opening degree, thereby requiring a throttle position<br>
sensor (throttle opening degree sensor). Therefore,<br>
this arrangement is not applicable to a motor vehicle<br>
having no throttle position sensor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a saddle type vehicle which allows for energy saving by<br><br><br>
stop control of an engine and reduces time required for<br>
restart of the engine for speedy start of the vehicle,<br>
and to provide an engine controlling apparatus and an<br>
idle stop cancel ing method for such a saddle type vehicle.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a saddle type vehicle including a fuel injection<br>
type engine and adapted to determine a proper fuel<br>
injection amount at restart of the engine for an improved<br>
engine restart capability, and to provide an engine<br>
controlling apparatus and an idle stop canceling method<br>
for such a saddle type vehicle.<br>
A saddle type vehicle according to the present<br>
invention includes an engine for driving a wheel of the<br>
vehicle, a braking apparatus, an engine stop controlling<br>
unit which stops the engine when a predetermined engine<br>
stop condition is satisfied, a brake state detecting unit<br>
which detects a brake state of the braking apparatus,<br>
and a restart controlling unit which restarts the engine<br>
once stopped by the engine stop controlling unit when<br>
deactuation of the braking apparatus is detected by the<br>
brake state detecting unit.<br>
With this arrangement, the engine is stopped when<br>
a predetermined engine stop condition is satisfied<br>
(so-called "idle stop control"). This improves energy<br>
saving. The engine once stopped is restarted in response<br><br><br>
to the detection of the deactuation of the braking<br>
apparatus. A typical procedure for the start of the<br>
saddle type vehicle is such that a driver deactuates the<br>
braking apparatus and then operates an accelerator.<br>
Therefore, the arrangement for restarting the engine in<br>
response to the detection of the deactuation of the braking<br>
apparatus facilitates the restart of the engine as<br>
compared with a case where the restart of the engine is<br>
based on detection of a throttle opening degree. This<br>
reduces the time required for the restart of the engine,<br>
thereby allowing for speedy start of the vehicle.<br>
Further, the restart of the engine in response to<br>
the detection of the deactuation of the braking apparatus<br>
does not necessarily require a throttle position sensor<br>
(TPS) which detects the throttle opening degree. That<br>
is, the aforementioned arrangement is applicable to a<br>
saddle type vehicle having no throttle position sensor.<br>
The restart of the engine is based on the detection<br>
of the deactuation of the braking apparatus as described<br>
above. Therefore, the engine is started when the driver<br>
deactuates the braking apparatus to walk away from the<br>
vehicle. This prevents the driver from leaving the<br>
vehicle when the vehicle is in an idle stop state.<br>
The saddle type vehicle may include a front wheel<br>
and a rear wheel, and the braking apparatus may include<br><br>
a front brake which brakes the front wheel and a rear<br>
bra ke wh ich bra kes the rear wheel . Inthiscase, thebrake<br>
state detecting unit preferably detects brake states of<br>
the front brake and the rear brake, and the restart<br>
controlling unit preferably restarts the engine when<br>
deactuation of the front brake for unbraking the front<br>
wheel is detected by the brake state detecting unit in<br>
a state where the front wheel and the rear wheel are<br>
respectively braked by the front brake and the rear brake.<br>
With this arrangement, the engine once stopped is<br>
restarted when the deactuation of the front brake is<br>
detected in the state where the front wheel and the rear<br>
wheel are respectively braked by the front brake and the<br>
rear brake. Thus, the vehicle can be properly started<br>
on an upward slope. In general, when the driver stops<br>
the saddle type vehicle on the slope, the driver actuates<br>
both the front brake and the rear brake. When the driver<br>
is to start the vehicle on the upward slope, the driver<br>
deactuates the front brake with the rear brake kept<br>
actuated for prevention of reverse movement of the vehicle,<br>
and then operates the accelerator (for throttle up) to<br>
start the vehicle. Therefore, the engine can be speedily<br>
restarted to start the vehicle on the upward slope by<br>
primarily detecting the deactuation of the front brake.<br>
This operation is performed, for example, to<br><br><br>
restart the engine once brought into the idle stop state<br>
by the actuation of both the front brake and the rear<br>
brake.<br>
Alternatively, the saddle type vehicle may include<br>
a front wheel and a rear wheel, and an accelerator to<br>
be operated by a driver for controlling an output of the<br>
engine, and the braking apparatus may include a front<br>
brake which brakes the front wheel and a rear brake which<br>
brakes the rear wheel. The saddle type vehicle may<br>
further include a front brake actuator and a rear brake<br>
actuator separately provided for actuating the front brake<br>
and the rear brake, respectively, and one of the front<br>
and rear brake actuators disposed closer to the<br>
accelerator than the other brake actuator may be defined<br>
as an accelerator side brake actuator. In this case, the<br>
brake state detecting unit preferably detects brake states<br>
of the front brake and the rear brake, and the restart<br>
controlling unit preferably restarts the engine when<br>
deactuation of one of the front and rear brakes associated<br>
with the accelerator side brake actuator for unbraking<br>
a corresponding one of the front and rear wheels is detected<br>
by the brake state detecting unit in a state where the<br>
front wheel and the rear wheel are respectively braked<br>
by the front brake and the rear brake.<br>
With this arrangement, the engine once stopped is<br><br>
restarted when the deactuation of the brake associated<br>
with the accelerator side brake actuator is detected in<br>
the state where the front wheel and the rear wheel are<br>
respectively braked by the front brake and the rear brake.<br>
In general, when the driver is to start the saddle type<br>
vehicle, the driver stops operation of the accelerator<br>
side brake actuator, and then operates the accelerator.<br>
Therefore, speedy start of the engine can be achieved<br>
to start the vehicle as intended by the driver by restarting<br>
the engine in response to the deactuation of the brake<br>
associated with the accelerator side brake actuator.<br>
In general, when the driver is to start the saddle<br>
type vehicle on an upward slope, the driver deactuates<br>
the brake associated with the accelerator side brake<br>
actuator, and operates the accelerator (for throttle up)<br>
while actuating the brake associated with the brake<br>
actuator disposed a way from the accelerator for prevent ion<br>
of reverse movement of the vehicle . Therefore, theengine<br>
can be speedily restarted tro start the vehicle on the<br>
upward slope by primarily detecting the deactuation of<br>
the brake associated with the accelerator side brake<br>
actuator.<br>
Alternatively, the saddle type vehicle may include<br>
a front wheel and a rear wheel, and the braking apparatus<br>
may include a front brake which brakes the front wheel<br><br>
and a rear brake which brakes the rear wheel. The brake<br>
state detecting unit may detect brake states of the front<br>
brake and the rear brake. In this case, the restart<br>
controlling unit preferably restarts the engine in<br>
response to deactuation of one of the front and rear brakes<br>
for unbraking a corresponding one of the front and rear<br>
wheels is detected by the brake state detecting unit in<br>
a state where the one wheel is braked by the one brake.<br>
With this arrangement, where one of the front and<br>
rear brakes is actuated for the braking, the engine once<br>
stopped is restarted upon the detection of the deactuation<br>
of the one brake. Thus, the engine can be restarted<br>
reliably and speedily as intended by the driver.<br>
This operation is performed to restart the engine<br>
once brought into the idle stop state by the actuation<br>
of one of the front and rear brakes, for example.<br>
The saddle type vehicle may further include a<br>
throttle opening degree detecting unit which detects the<br>
throttle opening degree of the engine. In this case, the<br>
restart controlling unit preferably restarts the engine<br>
once stopped by the engine stop controlling unit when<br>
a throttle opening degree not lower than a predetermined<br>
opening degree is detected by the throttle opening degree<br>
detecting unit.<br>
With this arrangement, the engine once stopped is<br><br><br>
restarted when the throttle opening degree not lower than<br>
the predetermined degree is detected. Therefore, the<br>
engine once brought into the idle stop state, for example,<br>
when the vehicle is stopped only by the rear brake on<br>
the upward slope, can be restarted simply by operating<br>
the accelerator (for throttle up).<br>
The restart controlling unit may restart the engine<br>
once brought into the idle stop state when a starter switch<br>
is operated for energization of a starter motor to start<br>
the engine. With this arrangement, the engine once<br>
brought into the idle stop state is restarted simply by<br>
operating the starter switch even without operating the<br>
braking apparatus.<br>
The saddle type vehicle may further include an<br>
engine temperature detecting unit which detects the<br>
temperature of the engine. In this case, the restart<br>
controlling unit preferably restarts the engine once<br>
stopped by the engine stop controlling unit when an engine<br>
temperature not higher than a predetermined temperature<br>
level is detected by the engine temperature detecting<br>
unit.<br>
With this arrangement, the engine once stopped is<br>
restarted when the engine temperature is not higher than<br>
the predetermined temperature level. This prevents<br>
reduction of the engine temperature to maintain the engine<br><br><br>
in a standby state that allows for reliable restart of<br>
the engine.<br>
The saddle type vehicle may further include a<br>
starter motor for starting the engine, a battery which<br>
supplies electric power to the starter motor, and a battery<br>
voltage detecting unit which detects the voltage of the<br>
battery. In this case, the restart controlling unit<br>
preferably restarts the engine once stopped by the engine<br>
stop controlling unit, when a battery voltage not higher<br>
than a predetermined voltage level is detected by the<br>
battery voltage detecting unit. With this arrangement,<br>
the engine once stopped is restarted when the battery<br>
voltage is not higher than the predetermined voltage level.<br>
Thus, the battery voltage is maintained at a level that<br>
allows for reliable driving of the starter motor.<br>
Therefore, the engine can be reliably restarted.<br>
The saddle type vehicle preferably further<br>
includes a headlight, and a headlight controlling unit<br>
which controls power supply to the headlight and reduces<br>
the power supply to the headlight when the engine is stopped<br>
by the engine stop controlling unit. With this<br>
arrangement, the power supply to the headlight is reduced<br>
when the engine is stopped. Since electric power consumed<br>
by actuation of the headlight in the idle stop is reduced,<br>
reduction of the battery voltage can be suppressed for<br><br><br>
reliable restart of the engine.<br>
The engine may be a fuel injection type engine.<br>
In general, the accelerator (throttle) of the<br>
saddle type vehicle is substantially fully closed<br>
immediately after the deactuat ion of the braking apparatus<br>
Therefore, it is easy to estimate the amount of air taken<br>
into the engine when the engine is restarted immediately<br>
after the deactuat ion of the braking apparatus and, hence,<br>
it is easy to determine a proper fuel injection amount<br>
compared to restarting the engine once in the idle stop<br>
state with throttle up only. Thus, an air-to-fuel ratio<br>
is maintained at a proper level, so that the engine can<br>
be more reliably restarted. Further, it is possible to<br>
suppress or prevent generation of toxic exhaust gas<br>
components which may otherwise occur due to an improper<br>
air-to-fuel ratio.<br>
More specifically, in the case of a carburetor type<br>
engine, the fuel supply amount is controlled principally<br>
by the amount of air taken into a cylinder. In the case<br>
of the fuel injection type engine, however, it is<br>
impossible to perform such a control operation.<br>
Therefore, the fuel injection is typically controlled<br>
to be effected in proper timing during a cranking rate<br>
increasing process after the start of the fuel injection<br>
type engine. More specifically, it is necessary to feed<br><br>
a fuel in an air flow into the cylinder before an engine<br>
air inlet port is opened (or when the engine air inlet<br>
port is opened). Therefore, the fuel injection amount<br>
is determined based on an estimate (the result of an<br>
experiment or a preliminary setting) without detecting<br>
the amount of air taken into the engine.<br>
The amount of air taken into the engine depends<br>
upon the throttle opening degree (in reality, further<br>
depends upon an engine speed (or a cranking rate at the<br>
restart)). With the arrangement for the restart of the<br>
engine in response to the increase of the throttle opening<br>
degree as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent 1<br>
Publication (KOKAI) No. 11-257123, it is difficult to<br>
properly determine the fuel injection amount at the<br>
restart, because the throttle opening degree at the<br>
restart is unstable and the intake air amount is<br>
correspondingly unstable.<br>
Where the engine is restarted in response to the<br>
deactuation of the braking apparatus, on the other hand,<br>
the throttle opening degree is substantially zero.<br>
Therefore, it is easy to estimate the intake air amount<br>
and to provide a proper fuel injection amount. Thus, a<br>
proper air-to-fuel ratio can be provided to properly start<br>
the engine. Further, it is possible to suppress the<br>
generation of the toxic exhaust gas components at the<br><br><br>
restart of the engine.<br>
An engine controlling apparatus according to the<br>
present invention is adapted for a saddle type vehicle<br>
which includes an engine for driving a wheel of the vehicle,<br>
and a braking apparatus. The engine controlling<br>
apparatus includes an engine stop controlling unit which<br>
stops the engine when a predetermined engine stop<br>
condition is satisfied, a brake state detecting unit which<br>
detects a brake state of the braking apparatus, and a<br>
restart controlling unit which restarts the engine once<br>
stopped by the engine stop controlling unit when<br>
deactuation of the braking apparatus is detected by the<br>
brake state detecting unit. This arrangement improves<br>
energy saving by idle stop, and ensures speedy restart<br>
of the engine to provide driving comfort.<br>
Where the saddle type vehicle includes a front wheel<br>
and a rear wheel and the braking apparatus includes a<br>
front brake which brakes the front wheel and a rear brake<br>
which brakes the rear wheel, the brake state detecting<br>
unit preferably detects brake states of the front brake<br>
and the rear brake, and the restart controlling unit<br>
preferably restarts the engine when deactuation of the<br>
front brake for unbraking the front wheel is detected<br>
by the brake state detecting unit in a state where the<br>
front wheel and the rear wheel are respectively braked<br><br>
by the front brake and the rear brake. With this<br>
arrangement, the saddle type vehicle can be properly<br>
started even on an upward slope.<br>
Alternatively, the saddle type vehicle may include<br>
a front wheel and a rear wheel, and an accelerator to<br>
be operated by a driver for controlling an output of the<br>
engine, and the braking apparatus may include a front<br>
brake which brakes the front wheel and a rear brake which<br>
brakes the rear wheel. Further, the saddle type vehicle<br>
may include a front brake actuator and a rear brake actuator<br>
separately provided for actuating the front brake and<br>
the rear brake, respectively, and one of the front and<br>
rear brake actuators disposed closer to the accelerator<br>
than the other brake actuator may be defined as an<br>
accelerator side bra ke actuator . In this case, the brake<br>
state detecting unit preferably detects brake states of<br>
the front brake and the rear brake, and the restart<br>
controlling unit preferably restarts the engine when<br>
deactuation of one of the front and rear brakes associated<br>
with the accelerator side brake actuator for unbraking<br>
a corresponding one of the front and rear wheels is detected<br>
by the brake state detecting unit in a state where the<br>
front wheel and the rear wheel are respectively braked<br>
by the front brake and the rear brake. With this<br>
arrangement, the saddle type vehicle can be speedily<br><br><br>
started as intended by the driver. In addition, the<br>
vehicle can be properly started even on an upward slope.<br>
Alternatively, the saddle type vehicle may include<br>
a front wheel and a rear wheel, and the braking apparatus<br>
may include a front brake which brakes the front wheel,<br>
and a rear brake which brakes the rear wheel. In this<br>
case, the brake state detecting unit preferably detects<br>
brake states of the front brake and the rear brake. The<br>
restart controlling unit preferably restarts the engine<br>
when deactuation of one of the front and rear brakes for<br>
unbraking a corresponding one of the front and rear wheels<br>
is detected by the brake state detecting unit in a state<br>
where the one wheel is braked by the one brake. With this<br>
arrangement, the engine can be speedily restarted as<br>
intended by the driver even if only one of the front and<br>
rear brakes is actuated for the braking.<br>
An idle stop canceling method is adapted for a<br>
saddle type vehicle which includes an engine for driving<br>
a wheel of the vehicle, and a braking apparatus. This<br>
method includes the steps of detecting a brake state of<br>
the braking apparatus, and restarting the engine once<br>
brought into an idle stop state when deactuation of the<br>
braking apparatus is detected in the brake state detecting<br>
step. This method improves energy saving by idle stop,<br>
and ensures speedy restart of the engine.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
First embodiment<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the<br>
construction of a two-wheeled vehicle 1 (such as a<br>
motor-cycle) as a saddle type vehicle according to a first<br><br><br>
embodiment of the present invention. The two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1 is a so-called scooter, i.e. , a relatively light<br>
saddle type vehicle which does not require a manual<br>
clutching operation for starting. The two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1 includes a vehicle body frame 2, a power unit<br>
3 attached to the vehicle body frame 2 in a vertically<br>
movable manner, a rear wheel 4 which is rotatable by a<br>
driving force received from the power unit 3, a front<br>
wheel 6 as a steerable wheel attached to a front portion<br>
of the vehicle body frame 2 via a fronts fork 5, and a<br>
handle 7 pivotal together with the front fork 5. A<br>
headlight 63 is provided in front of the handle 7 for<br>
illuminating a front side of the two-wheeled vehicle 1.<br>
The power unit 3 is movably connected to a lower<br>
middle portion of the vehicle body frame 2, and resiliently<br>
connected to a rear portion of the vehicle body frame<br>
2 via a rear cushion unit 8 . A driver's seat 9 is provided<br>
on an upper middle portion of the vehicle body frame 2,<br>
and a passenger's seat 10 is provided on a rear side of<br>
the driver's seat 9. A foot rest 11 is provided at a<br>
position of the vehicle body frame 2 between the seat<br>
9 and the handle 7. A front brake unit 12 and a rear brake<br>
unit 13 are provided in the front wheel 6 and the rear<br>
wheel 4, respectively.<br>
The power unit 3 integrally includes an engine 15<br><br><br>
and a transmission case 16. A driving force from a starter<br>
motor 18 is transmitted to a crank shaft 17 of the engine<br>
15 via a belt 19 and a one-way clutch (not shown) when<br>
the engine 15 is started. The transmission case 16<br>
accommodates a driving pulley 22 which receives rotation<br>
of the crank shaft 17 transmitted via gears 20, 21, a<br>
driven pulley 23 which receives rotation of the driving<br>
pulley 22 transmitted via a belt 25 and is connected to<br>
the rear wheel 4, and a centrifugal clutch 24 switchable<br>
between a state in which rotation of the gear 21 is<br>
transmitted to the driving pulley 22 and a state in which<br>
the rotation of the gear 21 is not transmitted to the<br>
driving pulley 22. The driving force of the starter motor<br>
18 may be transmitted to the crank shaft 17 by gears instead<br>
of the belt 19.<br>
The centrifugal clutch 24 is a rotation-speed<br>
responsive clutch which connects the gear 21 to the drive<br>
pulley 22 to transmit the driving force from the engine<br>
15 to the driving pulley 22 when the rotation speed of<br>
the engine 15 reaches a predetermined transmission<br>
rotation speed. Thus, the driving force of the engine<br>
15 is transmitted to the rear wheel 4 to start the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle 1 when the rotation speed of the engine<br>
15 reaches the transmission rotation speed.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic plan view illustrating an<br><br><br>
arrangement relating to the handle 7. The handle 7<br>
includes handle shafts 26 extending laterally, a left<br>
grip 27 and a right grip (manually operable accelerator)<br>
28 which are respectively gripped by left and right hands<br>
of the driver, a rear brake lever 29 provided in association<br>
with the left grip 27, a front brake lever 30 provided<br>
in association with the right grip 28, and a handle cover<br>
31 which covers a region of the handle between the left<br>
and right grips 27, 28.<br>
The right grip 28 functions as an accelerator<br>
(accelerator grip), and is rotatable about the handle<br>
shaft 26. The throttle opening degree of the engine 15<br>
is increased to increase an engine output by rotating<br>
the right grip 28 toward the driver, and is reduced to<br>
reduce the engine output by rotating the right grip 28<br>
away from the driver (forward). The operation of the<br>
right grip 28 is mechanically transmitted to a throttle<br>
45 (see Fig. 3) to be described later via an accelerator<br>
wire 32.<br>
The rear brake lever 29 is defined as a rear brake<br>
actuator which is operated by the driver to actuate the<br>
rear brake unit 13 for braking the rear wheel. Similarly,<br>
the front brake lever 30 is defined as a front brake<br>
actuator which is operated by the driver to actuate the<br>
front brake unit 12 for braking the front wheel. The<br><br><br>
operation of the brake levers 29, 30 may be transmitted<br>
to the brake units 13, 12 via wires, or the brake units<br>
13, 12 may be actuated by hydraulic mechanisms which<br>
respectively operate according to the operation of the<br>
brake levers 29, 30. In any cases, the front wheel 6 is<br>
braked by gripping the front brake lever 30, and unbraked<br>
by releasing the front brake lever 30. Similarly, the<br>
rear wheel 4 is braked by gripping the rear brake lever<br>
29, and unbraked by releasing the rear brake lever 29.<br>
An instrument panel 35 is provided at the center<br>
of the handle cover 31. A main switch 34 which brings<br>
the engine 15 into a stand-by state and a starter switch<br>
36 which starts the engine 15 are provided between the<br>
instrument panel 35 and the right grip 28 on the handle<br>
cover 31. The instrument panel 35 includes a speed meter<br>
37, a fuel meter 38 and the like.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an<br>
arrangement relating to control of the engine 15 of the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle 1. The engine 15 is of a fuel<br>
injection type, for example, a four-cycle engine having<br>
a single cylinder. The two-wheeled vehicle 1 includes<br>
an FI (Electronic Fuel Injection System) controller<br>
(electronic control unit) 70 defined as an engine output<br>
controlling unit which electronically controls fuel<br>
injection to the engine 15, an ISG (Integrated Starter<br><br><br>
Generator) 72 integrally including a power generator and<br>
the starter motor 18, an ISG controller 71 which controls<br>
the ISG 72, and a battery 75. In this embodiment, the<br>
FI controller 70 also functions as an engine stop<br>
controlling unit which brings the engine 15 into an idle<br>
stop state, a brake state detecting unit which detects<br>
operation states of the brake units 12, 13, and a restart<br>
controlling unit which restarts the engine 15 once brought<br>
into the idle stop state.<br>
The FI controller 70 receives a cam signal that<br>
is input as an output signal of a cam sensor 52 which<br>
detects a cam position on the basis of movement of a timing<br>
rotor (not shown) attached to a cam shaft 51 of the engine<br>
15. The stroke of the engine 15 is determined based on<br>
the cam signal.<br>
The FI controller 70 further receives a crank angle<br>
signal that is input as an output signal of a crank angle<br>
sensor 54 which detects a crank position on the basis<br>
of movement of a timing rotor (not shown) attached to<br>
the crankshaft 17 of the engine 15. The crank angle signal<br>
indicates the result of the detection of a crank angle<br>
of the engine 15. The FI controller 70 detects an engine<br>
speed by detecting an interval (cycle) of crank angle<br>
signals.<br>
The FI controller 70 further receives a vehicle<br><br><br>
speed signal that is input as an output signal of a magnet<br>
sensor 55 (see Fig. 1) which detects the vehicle speed<br>
of the two-wheeled vehicle 1 on the basis of movement<br>
of the driven pulley 23 attached to the wheel (e.g., the<br>
rear wheel 4). The vehicle speed of the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1 is detected on the basis of a time interval<br>
of pulses output from the magnet sensor 55. That is, the<br>
FI controller 70 detects the wheel rotation speed of the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle 1 by detecting the interval (cycle)<br>
of vehicle speed signals, and converting the wheel<br>
rotation speed into the vehicle speed.<br>
The FI controller 70 further receives a starter<br>
signal that is input when the starter switch 36 provided<br>
on the handle 7 of the two-wheeled vehicle 1 is turned<br>
on. In the two-wheeled vehicle 1, the starter signal is<br>
used as an engine start signal for starting the engine<br>
15. In general, a scooter is designed so that the engine<br>
15 cannot be started unless the brake units are in a braking<br>
state.<br>
Further, a throttle opening degree signal<br>
indicating the throttle opening degree of the throttle<br>
45 of a butterfly valve type provided in an air inlet<br>
pipe 40 of the engine 15 is input to the FI controller<br>
70 from a throttle position sensor 46 (a throttle opening<br>
degree detecting unit) . The throttle position sensor 46<br><br><br>
detects the opening degree of the throttle 45, and outputs<br>
the throttle opening degree signal which indicates the<br>
opening degree. The throttle opening degree signal<br>
changes linearly with the throttle opening degree, for<br>
example. The operation of the right grip 28 as the<br>
accelerator is mechanically transmitted to the throttle<br>
45 via the accelerator wire 32. Therefore, the opening<br>
degree of the throttle 45 is associated with the operation<br>
amount of the right grip 28.<br>
An air inlet pipe negative pressure sensor 43 which<br>
detects a negative pressure in the air inlet pipe 40 is<br>
disposed downstream of the throttle 45 with respect to<br>
an air intake direction in the air inlet pipe 40. An output<br>
signal of the air inlet pipe negative pressure sensor<br>
43 is input to the FI controller 70.<br>
The FI controller 70 further receives an engine<br>
temperature signal that is input as an output signal of<br>
a temperature sensor 48 which detects the temperature<br>
of the engine 15 . The FI controller 70 detects the warming<br>
state of the engine 15 (easiness of the restart) on the<br>
basis of the engine temperature signal. The temperature<br>
sensor 48 may be arranged to detect the temperature of<br>
the cylinder block of the engine 15. Where the engine<br>
15 is cooled by a water cooling system, a water temperature<br>
sensor which detects the temperature of the cooling water<br><br><br>
may be provided in a radiator, and the engine temperature<br>
may be estimated basedonanputputofthe water temperature<br>
sensor.<br>
Further, a front brake signal is input to the FI<br>
controller 70. That is, the operation state of the front<br>
brake lever 30 is detected by a front brake switch 57<br>
(see Fig. 2) , and output as an ON/OFF signal (front brake<br>
signal) to the FI controller 70.<br>
Further, a rear brake signal is input to the FI<br>
controller 70. That is, the operation state of the rear<br>
brake lever 29 is detected by a rear brake switch 58 (see<br>
Fig. 2), and output as an ON/OFF signal (rear brake signal)<br>
to the FI controller 70. The FI controller 70 detects<br>
brake states of the brake units 12, 13 on the basis of<br>
these two brake signals.<br>
Further, a battery voltage is input to the FI<br>
controller 70 from the battery 75. The FI controller 70<br>
further receives a turn switch signal indicating the<br>
operation state of a turn switch which is operated by<br>
the driver to actuate a right or left blinker when the<br>
vehicle is to be turned right or left.<br>
An injector (INJ, fuel iniector) 60, an ignition<br>
coil (IGN) 61 and a fuel pump 62 are connected to output<br>
terminals of the FI controller 70. Further, a PWM (Pulse<br>
Width Modulation) control circuit 65 which adjusts power<br><br><br>
supply to the headlight 63 by PWM control is connected<br>
to the FI controller 70.<br>
The FI controller 70 applies a start signal for<br>
starting the ISG 72, and a power generation electric<br>
current command value and a power generation voltage<br>
command value for the ISG 72 to the ISG controller 71.<br>
Thus, the ISG controller 71 drives the ISG 72, and receives<br>
a rotation signal from the ISG 72.<br>
The ISG 72 is driven by the engine 15 to generate<br>
electric power. The electric power generated by the ISG<br>
72 is charged into the battery 75 via the ISG controller<br>
71. Thebattery 75 supplies the electric power to driving<br>
circuits of electric components.<br>
The start signal is output as a start command from<br>
the FI controller 70 to the ISG controller 71 when the<br>
starter signal is detected or an idle stop cancellation<br>
condition for the restart is satisfied.<br>
The two-wheeled vehicle 1 according to this<br>
embodiment is designed so that the engine 15 is brought<br>
into the idle stop state tnrougn tne control of the FI<br>
controller 70 for suppression of needless fuel consumption<br>
in the idling when predetermined idle stop effectuation<br>
conditions are all satisfied.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram showing idle stop effectuation<br>
conditions (1) to (6) for the idle stop of the engine<br><br><br>
15 of the two-wheeled vehicle 1 (engine stop conditions)<br>
according to this embodiment.<br>
Effectuation condition (1): The engine temperature is<br>
not lower than a predetermined temperature level.<br>
The effectuation condition (1) that the engine<br>
temperature is not lower than the predetermined<br>
temperature level (e.g., 65oC) is satisfied, if the engine<br>
temperature signal output from the temperature sensor<br>
48 is not lower than a predetermined level. This<br>
condition means that the engine temperature is<br>
sufficiently high to bring the engine 15 into the idle<br>
stop state. In other words, the engine temperature is<br>
sufficiently high for easy restart of the engine 15 once<br>
stopped. It is noted that the reference engine<br>
temperature for the effectuation condition (1) is not<br>
limited to 65°C.<br>
Effectuation condition (2): The vehicle speed is once<br>
increased to a level not lower than a predetermined speed.<br>
The effectuation condition (2) that the vehicle<br>
speed is once increased to a level not lower than the<br>
predetermined speed (e.g., 10km/h) is satisfied, if it<br>
is judged, for example, on the basis of the vehicle speed<br>
signal, that the two-wheeled vehicle 1 is driven<br>
immediately before the engine 15 is brought into the idle<br>
stop state. There is a possibility that the battery 75<br><br><br>
is not sufficiently charged if the vehicle is driven at<br>
a lower speed. In this connection, the effectuation<br>
condition (2) means that the battery 75 is charged<br>
sufficiently for easy restart of the engine 15 once stopped.<br>
It is noted that the reference vehicle speed for the<br>
effectuation condition (2) is not limited to 10 km/h.<br>
Effectuation condition (3) : The cattery voltage is not<br>
lower than a predetermined voltage level.<br>
The effectuation condition (3) that the battery<br>
voltage is not lower than the predetermined voltage level<br>
(e.g., 12.0V) is satisfied, if the battery voltage applied<br>
to the FI controller 70 is not lower than a predetermined<br>
voltage level. This condition means that electric power<br>
sufficient for the restart of the engine 15 is provided.<br>
It is noted that the reference battery voltage for the<br>
effectuation condition (3) is not limited to 12.0 V.<br>
Effectuation condition (4): At least one of the brake<br>
switches is on.<br>
The effectuation condition (4) that at least one<br>
of the brake switches is on is satisfied, if the front<br>
brake signal of the front brake switch 57 or the rear<br>
brake signal of the rear brake switch 58 is input to the<br>
FT controller 70. This condition means that the driver<br>
intends to stop the two-wheeled vehicle 1.<br>
Effectuation condition (5): The throttle is fully closed<br><br><br>
and the engine is in an idle state.<br>
On the basis of the throttle opening degree signal<br>
applied from the throttle position sensor 46 and the crank<br>
angle signal of the crank angle sensor 54, it is judged<br>
whether the effectuation condition (5) that the throttle<br>
45 is fully closed and the engine speed is equal to an<br>
idle speed is satisfied. This condition means that the<br>
engine 15 is rotated at a speed not higher than a<br>
predetermined speed in the idle state with the throttle<br>
being fully closed. The judgment on whether the throttle<br>
45 is fully closed may be based on whether the air inlet<br>
pipe negative pressure of the engine 15 is at a negative<br>
pressure level observed in the idle state, rather than<br>
based on the throttle opening degree signal of the throttle<br>
position sensor 46. The air inlet pipe negative pressure<br>
is determined based on the output signal of the air inlet<br>
pipe negative pressure sensor 43, and is defined as a<br>
bottom pressure of the air inlet pipe observed immediately<br>
before an air inlet port of the engine 15 is closed. Thus,<br>
the judgment on whether the throttle 45 is fully closed<br>
can be achieved by a less expensive method.<br>
Effectuation condition (6): The duration of a zero<br>
vehicle speed state is not shorter than a predetermined<br>
period.<br>
On the basis of the interval of the pulses output<br><br><br>
from the magnet sensor 55 (see Fig. 1) and a timer (not<br>
shown) incorporated in the FI controller 70, it is judged<br>
whether the effectuation condition (6) that the duration<br>
of the zero vehicle speed state (0 km/h) is not shorter<br>
than the predetermined period (e.g., 3 seconds) is<br>
satisfied. It is difficult to detect the zero vehicle<br>
speed state, because the wheel is not rotated. Therefore,<br>
the zero vehicle speed state is detected when the interval<br>
of the output pulses of the magnet sensor 55 is increased<br>
to a certain level according to the rotation speed of<br>
the driven pulley 23 connected to the rear wheel 4 in<br>
the. two-wheeled vehicle 1. The effectuation condition<br>
(6) that the duration of the zero vehicle speed state<br>
is not shorter than the predetermined period prevents<br>
the idle stop of the engine 15, for example, when the<br>
vehicle is temporarily stopped at a railway crossing.<br>
This prevents frequent idle stop of the engine 15. It<br>
is noted that the reference period for the duration of<br>
the zero vehicle speed state for the effectuation<br>
condition (6) is not limited to 3 seconds. The vehicle<br>
speed may be determined based on the speed of the front<br>
wheel 6.<br>
In this embodiment, when the two-wheeled vehicle<br>
1 satisfies all the effectuation conditions (1) to (6),<br>
the fuel injection and the ignition are immediately<br><br><br>
stopped to bring the engine 15 into the idle stop state.<br>
If no consideration is given to inconvenience of frequent<br>
restart of the engine, the effectuation condition (2)<br>
may be excluded from the essential conditions for the<br>
idle stop.<br>
In this embodiment, the two-wheeled vehicle 1 is<br>
designed so as to restart the engine 15 once brought into<br>
the idle stop state if at least one of the following<br>
predetermined idle stop cancellation conditions (restart<br>
conditions) is satisfied.<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the idle stop<br>
cancellation conditions (1) to (5) for the restart of<br>
the engine 15 in the two-wheeled vehicle 1 according to<br>
this embodiment.<br>
Cancellation condition (1): An unbrakina operation is<br>
performed.<br>
The cancellation condition (1) that the unbraking<br>
operation is performed is satisfied, if one of the front<br>
brake lever 30 and the rear brake lever 29 is released<br>
to turn off/on a corresponding one of the brake switches<br>
57, 58. In other words, the cancellation condition (1)<br>
is satisfied, if one of the front brake signal of the<br>
front brake switch 57 and the rear brake signal of the<br>
rear brake switch 58 is no longer input to the FI controller<br>
70. That is, the engine 15 once brought into the idle<br><br><br>
stop state is restarted when the driver releases the front<br>
brake lever 30 or the rear brake lever 29 of the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1.<br>
More specifically, the cancellation condition (1)<br>
involves the following three cases.<br>
(a)	Where both the front brake unit 12 and the rear<br>
brake unit 13 are actuated during the idle stop, the<br>
deactuation of the front brake unit 12 operated by the<br>
front brake lever 30 disposed on the same side as the<br>
accelerator (right grip 28) is defined as the idle stop<br>
cancellation condition.<br>
(b)	Where only the rearbrakeunit 13 is actuated during<br>
the idle stop, the deactuation of the rear brake unit<br>
13 is defined as the idle stop cancellation condition.<br>
(c)	Where only the front brake unit 12 is actuated<br>
during the idle stop, the deactuation of the front brake<br>
unit 12 is defined as the idle stop cancellation condition.<br>
Cancellation condition (2): The throttle opening degree<br>
is not lower than a predetermined opening degree.<br>
On the basis of the throttle opening degree signal<br>
output from the throttle position sensor 46, it is judged<br>
whether the cancellation condition (2) that the throttle<br>
opening degree is not lower than the predetermined opening<br>
degree (e.g., 22 degrees) is satisfied. This condition<br>
means that the driver turns the right grip (accelerator<br><br><br>
grip) 28 of the handle 7 to start the two-wheeled vehicle<br>
1. It is noted that the reference throttle opening degree<br>
for the cancellation condition (2) is not limited to 22<br>
degrees.<br>
Cancellation condition (3): The starter switch is turned<br>
The cancellation condition (3) that the starter<br>
switch 36 is turned on is satisfied, if the starter signal<br>
of the starter switch 36 is input to the FI controller<br>
70. This condition means that the driver presses the<br>
starter switch 36 to start the two-wheeled vehicle 1.<br>
When the starter switch 36 is turned on to restart the<br>
engine 15, the starter signal is output as long as the<br>
starter switch 36 is on. However, the duration of the<br>
starter signal output by single operation of the starter<br>
switch 36 is limited to a predetermined period (e.g.,<br>
2.5 seconds) . It is noted that, when the engine 15 is<br>
automatically restarted irrespective of the cancellation<br>
condition (3), the starter signal is output for a<br>
predetermined period (e.g., 2.5 seconds).<br>
Cancellation condition (4) : The engine temperature is<br>
lower than a predetermined temperature level.<br>
The cancellation condition (4) that the engine<br>
temperature is lower than the predetermined temperature<br>
level (e.g., 55°C) is satisfied, if the engine temperature<br><br><br>
signal of the temperature sensor 48 is lower than a<br>
predetermined level. This condition means that the<br>
engine temperature is not maintained at a temperature<br>
level that ensures smooth restart of the engine 15. That<br>
is, when the engine temperature is lower than the<br>
predetermined temperature level in the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1, the idle stop is cancelled to restart the engine<br>
15, so that the engine temperature is maintained at not<br>
lower than the predetermined temperature level. It is<br>
noted that the reference engine temperature for the<br>
cancellation condition (4) is not limited to 55°C.<br>
Cancellation condition (5): The batterv voltaqe is lower<br>
than a predetermined voltage level.<br>
The cancellation condition (5) that the battery<br>
voltage is lower than the predetermined voltage level<br>
(e.g., 11.8 V) is satisfied, if the battery voltage applied<br>
to the FI controller 70 is lower than a predetermined<br>
voltage level. The reference voltage level for the<br>
cancellation condition (5) is set lower than the reference<br>
voltage level for the idle stop effectuation condition<br>
(3). Even during the idle stop, electric power of the<br>
battery 75 is consumed, for example, by the brake lamp.<br>
When the electric power charged in the battery 75 is lower<br>
than a predetermined power level, it is impossible to<br>
reliably restart the engine. Therefore, the idle stop<br><br><br>
is canceled to restart the engine 15 for charging the<br>
battery 75, when the battery voltage is lower than the<br>
predetermined power level even with the vehicle being<br>
stopped. It is noted that the reference battery voltage<br>
for the cancellation condition (5) is not limited to 11.8<br>
V.<br>
Next, transition of the state of the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1 according to this embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 6 is a state transition diagram showing the<br>
transition of the state of the engine 15 of the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1. The engine 15 has an operation mode which is<br>
switched between a stop mode, a start mode, an idle stop<br>
mode and an ordinary driving mode under predetermined<br>
conditions. The ordinary driving mode includes a steady<br>
driving mode and a trans itional driving mode. State data<br>
indicating the current state (mode) of the engine 15 is<br>
stored in a state management memory (not shown) provided<br>
in the FI controller 70.<br>
In Fig. 6, when the main switch 34 (see Fig. 2)<br>
is turned on in a power off state, the operation mode<br>
of the engine 15 is switched to the stop mode (T1).<br>
When the driver turns on the starter switch 36 or<br>
performs a push-start or kick-start operation for cranking<br>
in the stop mode, the operation mode of the engine 15<br>
is switched to the start mode (T2). If engine stall occurs<br><br>
in the start mode, the operation mode of the engine 15<br>
is switched back to the stop mode (T3) . Then, the engine<br>
15 is ignited in the start mode and, when a predetermined<br>
complete explosion engine speed is reached, the operation<br>
mode of the engine 15 is switched to a warming mode of<br>
the steady driving mode (T4) .<br>
When the main switch 34 is turned off in the ordinary<br>
driving mode, the engine 15 is turned off (T5). When a<br>
stop switch (not shown) is turned on, the operation mode<br>
of the engine 15 is switched to the stop mode (T6).<br>
On the other hand, when all the idle stop<br>
effectuation conditions (1) to (6) described above are<br>
satisfied in the steady driving mode, the operation mode<br>
of the engine 15 is switched to the idle stop mode (T7) .<br>
Then, the operation mode of the engine 15 once switched<br>
to the idle stop mode is switched again to the start mode<br>
for the restart of the engine 15 (T8) when at least one<br>
of the idle stop cancellation conditions (1) to (5)<br>
described above is satisfied.<br>
When the engine 15 is to be accelerated in the steady<br>
driving mode of the ordinary driving mode, the operation<br>
mode of the engine 15 is switched to the transitional<br>
driving mode for acceleration (T9). When the<br>
acceleration of the engine 15 ends in the transitional<br>
driving mode, the operation mode of the engine 15 is<br><br><br>
switched back to the steady driving mode (T10).<br>
The engine 15 brought into the transitional driving<br>
mode is repeatedly accelerated (T11) and decelerated (T12)<br>
by abrupt acceleration and deceleration.<br>
When a deceleration fuel cut condition (fuel cut<br>
condition) is satisfied in the steady driving mode, the<br>
operation mode of the engine 15 is switched to the<br>
transitional driving mode for deceleration (T13). The<br>
decelerated engine 15 is restored from the fuel cut<br>
operation for driving, and the ope ration mode of the engine<br>
15 is switched back to the steady driving mode (T14).<br>
Fig. 7 is a flow chart of a control operation to<br>
be performed by the FI controller 70 for controlling the<br>
engine 15. Particularly, the control operation shown in<br>
Fig. 7 is repeatedly performed by the FI controller 70<br>
when the main switch 34 is turned on for power supply.<br>
The FI controller 70 detects the engine temperature on<br>
the basis of the output of the temperature sensor 48 (Step<br>
S1, in which the FI controller 70 functions as an engine<br>
temperature detecting unit). Further, the FI controller<br>
70 detects the state of the engine as described with<br>
reference to Fig. 6 (Step S2). More specifically, the<br>
FI controller 70 refers to the state data stored in the<br>
state management memory. Further, the FI controller 70<br>
determines the vehicle speed by processing the output<br><br><br>
of the magnet sensor 55 (Step S3) , and detects the battery<br>
voltage output from the battery 75 (Step S4). The FI<br>
controller 70 further detects the throttle opening degree<br>
on the basis of the output of the throttle position sensor<br>
4 6 (step S5) . Then, the FI controller 70 detects the brake<br>
states on the basis of the outputs of the brake switches<br>
57, 58 (Step S6).<br>
With reference to the aforementioned state data,<br>
the FI controller 70 determines whether the engine 15<br>
is stopped (Step S7). If the engine 15 is not stopped<br>
(NO in Step S7), the FI controller 70 judges whether an<br>
idle stop operation is to be performed to stop the engine<br>
15 (Step S8). This operation will be detailed later.<br>
If the idle stop operation is not to be performed<br>
(NO in Step S8), the FI controller 70 clears an idle stop<br>
flag (Step S9) . The idle stop flag is herein defined as<br>
a flag which indicates that the idle stop operation is<br>
performed, and is set when all the idle stop effectuation<br>
conditions are satisfied.<br>
Then, the FI controller 70 determines the engine<br>
speed on the basis of the output signal of the crank angle<br>
sensor 54, and judges whether a condition that the engine<br>
speed is not lower than the complete explosion engine<br>
speed is satisfied (Step S10) . This judgment is negative<br>
during the cranking. However, once the explosion starts ,<br><br><br>
the engine speed is increased to a level not lower than<br>
the complete explosion engine speed.<br>
If YES in Step S10 (the engine speed is not lower<br>
than the complete explosion engine speed) thereby to<br>
indicate that the engine is started, the FI controller<br>
70 judges on the basis of the output signal of the magnet<br>
sensor 55 (vehicle speed sensor) whether a condition that<br>
the vehicle speed is not higher than a predetermined speed<br>
(e.g., 1 km/h) is satisfied, i.e., whether the two-wheeled<br>
vehicle 1 is stopped (Step S11). If the vehicle is stopped<br>
(YES in Step S11), an idling control process is performed<br>
(Steps S12, S13).<br>
In the idling control process, the FI controller<br>
70 calculates a fuel injection amount, fuel injection<br>
timing and ignition timing for the idling (Step S12).<br>
Then, the FI controller 70 controls the injector 60 on<br>
the basis of command values corresponding to the fuel<br>
injection amount and the injection timing thus calculated,<br>
and controls the ignition coil 61 so as to ignite the<br>
fuel in the calculated ignition timing (Step S13).<br>
Thereafter, the routine returns to Step SI to perform<br>
a process sequence from Step SI.<br>
On the other hand, if the two-wheeled vehicle 1<br>
is not stopped (NO in Step S11), the FI controller 70<br>
calculates the fuel injection amount, the fuel injection<br><br><br>
timing and the ignition timing according to the throttle<br>
opening degree and the engine speed (Step S14). Then,<br>
the FI controller 70 controls the injector 60 on the basis<br>
of the fuel injection amount and the fuel injection timing<br>
thus calculated, and controls the ignition coil 61 in<br>
the calculated ignition timing (Step S15). Thereafter,<br>
the routine returns to Step S1 to perform the process<br>
sequence from Step S1.<br>
On the other hand, if the engine is stopped (YES<br>
in Step S7), the FI controller 70 calculates the fuel<br>
injection amount, the fuel injection timing and the<br>
ignition timing for the restart of the engine 15 (Step<br>
S16). Further, the FI controller 70 judges whether a<br>
start request is applied to the FI controller 70 (Step<br>
S17). If the start request is not applied (NO in Step<br>
S17), the FI controller 70 continuously stops the fuel<br>
injection from the injector 60 (Step S26), and keeps the<br>
fuel pump 62 inactive (Step S27).<br>
If the start request is applied (YES in Step S17) ,<br>
the FI controller 70 clears the idle stop flag (Step S18) ,<br>
and applies the start command to the ISG controller 71<br>
(Step S19). Thus, the ISG controller 71 starts the<br>
starter motor 18. Further, the FI controller 70 actuates<br>
the fuel pump 62 (Step S20) . Then, the FI controller 70<br>
controls the injector 60 on the basis of the fuel injection<br><br><br>
amount and the fuel injection timing calculated in Step<br>
S16, and controls the ignition coil 61 on the basis of<br>
the ignition timing calculated in Step S16 (Step S21).<br>
In a process sequence from Step S18 to Step S21 and a<br>
cancellation judging process (Step S29) to be described<br>
later, the FI controller 70 functions as a restart<br>
controlling unit for restarting the engine 15 once brought<br>
into the idle stop state.<br>
Further, the FI controller 70 judges whether a<br>
dimming process to be described later is performed for<br>
reducing the power supply to the headlight 63 (Step S22).<br>
If the dimming process is performed (YES in Step S22),<br>
a headlight restoration process is performed to restore<br>
the power supply to the headlight 63 to an ordinary level<br>
(Step S23). Thereafter, the routine returns to Step S1<br>
to repeat the process from Step S1. If the dimming process<br>
is not performed (NO in Step S22), the routine returns<br>
to Step S1 without performing the headlight restoration<br>
process.<br>
If the idle stop operation is to be performed to<br>
stop the engine 15 (YES in Step S8) when the engine is<br>
active (NO in Step S7), the FI controller 70 stores a<br>
brake state code (to be described later) obtained in the<br>
brake state detecting process (Step S6) in an internal<br>
memory 70M (see Fig. 3) (Step S24). Further, the FI<br><br><br>
controller 70 sets the idle stop flag indicating that<br>
the engine is in the idle stop state (Step S25) . Then,<br>
the FI controller 70 stops the fuel injection from the<br>
injector 60 (Step S26) , and stops the fuel pump 62 (Step<br>
S27) . Thus, the engine 15 is stopped. In the Steps S8<br>
and S25 to S27, the FI controller 70 functions as the<br>
engine stop controlling unit.<br>
The FI controller 70 performs the headlight dimming<br>
process (Step S28) for reducing the power supply to the<br>
headlight 63, and performs the cancellation judging<br>
process (Step S29) for judging whether the engine 15 is<br>
to be restarted from the idle stop state. Thereafter,<br>
the routine returns to Step S1.<br>
During the cranking (during the engine start by<br>
the starter motor 18) , the judgment inStepSlOisnegative.<br>
In this case, the routine goes to Step S21 to continuously<br>
control the injector 60 and the injection coil 61 on the<br>
basis of the fuel injection amount, the fuel injection<br>
timing and the ignition timing for the start of the engine.<br>
Fig. 8 is a flow chart of a specific example of<br>
the brake state detecting process (Step S6 in Fig. 7).<br>
The FI controller 70 fetches the front brake signal from<br>
the front brake switch 57 (see Fig. 2) and the rear brake<br>
signal from the rear brake switch 58 (see Fig. 2) to detect<br>
the operation states (brake states) of the front brake<br><br>
unit 12 and the rear brake unit 13 (Steps S41, S42) . On<br>
the basis of the detected operation states, the FI<br>
controller 70 encodes the brake states of the front and<br>
rear brake units 12, 13 (Step S 43) .<br>
More specifically, the lowest two bits of 1-bite<br>
(8-bit) data are assigned to the brake state code for<br>
the front and rear brake units 12, 13. In the example<br>
shown in Fig. 8, the second lowest bit is assigned to<br>
the brake state of the front brake unit 12, and the lowest<br>
bit is assigned to the brake state of the rear brake unit<br>
13. In this example, a bit value of 1 indicates that the<br>
corresponding brake unit is actuated (in a braking state) ,<br>
and a bit value of 0 indicates that the corresponding<br>
brake unit is deactuated (in an unbraking state). That<br>
is, the brake state code represented by the two bits<br>
indicates the following four brake states.<br>
00: Both the front brake unit and the rear brake unit<br>
are in the unbraking state.<br>
01: The front brake unit is in the unbraking state,<br>
and the rear brake unit is in the braking state.<br>
10: The front brake unit is in the braking state, and<br>
the rear brake unit is in the unbraking state.<br>
11	Both the front brake unit and the rear brake unit<br>
are in the braking state.<br>
If it is judged in the idle stop effectuation<br><br>
judgment (Step S8 in Fig. 7) that the idle stop operation<br>
is to be performed, the brake state code is stored in<br>
the memory 70M.<br>
Fig. 9 is a flow chart of an exemplary sub-routine<br>
for the idle stop effectuation judgment (Step S8 in Fig.<br>
7) . The FI controller 70 judges whether the effectuation<br>
condition (1) that the engine temperature is not lower<br>
than the predetermined temperature level is satisfied<br>
(Step S51). If NO in Step S51 (the engine temperature<br>
is lower than the predetermined temperature level), the<br>
idle stop effectuation condition (1) is not satisfied.<br>
Therefore, the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop<br>
operation is not to be performed (Step S60), and the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine shown in Fig.<br>
7.<br>
If YES in Step S51 (the engine temperature is not<br>
lower than the predetermined temperature level) , the idle<br>
stop effectuation condition (1) is satisfied. Then, the<br>
FI controller 70 judges whether the brake state code is<br>
"00" (Step S52). If the brake state code is "00" (YES<br>
in Step S52), both the front and rear brake units 12,<br>
13 are in the unbraking state and, hence, the idle stop<br>
effectuation condition (4) is not satisfied. Therefore,<br>
the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop operation<br>
is not to be performed (Step S60), and the sub-routine<br><br><br>
returns to the main routine.<br>
On the other hand, if the brake state code is not<br>
"00" (NO in Step S52) , at least one of the front and rear<br>
brake units 12, 13 is in the braking state and, hence,<br>
the idle stop effectuation condition (4) is satisfied.<br>
Then, the FI controller 70 judges whether a condition<br>
that the battery voltage is not lower than the<br>
predetermined voltage level is satisfied (Step S53) . If<br>
NO in Step S53 (the battery voltage is lower than the<br>
predetermined voltage level.) , the idle stop effectuation<br>
condition (3) is not satisfied. Therefore, the FI<br>
controller 70 judges that the idle stop operation is not<br>
to be performed (Step S60) , and the sub-routine returns<br>
to the main routine.<br>
On the other hand, if YES in Step S53 (the battery<br>
voltage is not lower than the predetermined voltage level) ,<br>
the idle stop effectuation condition (3) is satisfied.<br>
Then, the FI controller 70 judges whether the vehicle<br>
speed is substantially zero (Step S54) . If the vehicle<br>
speed is not substantially zero (NO in Step S54), the<br>
idle stop effectuation condition (6) is not satisfied.<br>
Therefore, the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop<br>
operation is not to be performed (Step S60), and the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If the vehicle speed is substantially zero (YES<br><br><br>
in Step S54), the FI controller 70 judges whether a<br>
condition that the engine speed is not higher than the<br>
idle speed is satisfied (Step S55). If NO in Step S55<br>
(the engine speed is higher than the idle speed), the<br>
idle stop effectuation condition (5) is not satisfied.<br>
Therefore, the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop<br>
operation is not to be performed (Step S60), and the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If YES in Step S55 (the engine speed is not higher<br>
than the idle speed), the engine 15 is rotated in the<br>
idle state. Then, the FI controller 70 further judges<br>
whether the throttle 45 is fully closed (Step S56). If<br>
the throttle 45 is not fully closed (NO in Step S56),<br>
the idle stop effectuation condition (5) is not satisfied.<br>
Therefore, the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop<br>
operation is not to be performed (Step S60), and the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If the throttle is fully closed (YES in Step S56) ,<br>
the idle stop effectuation condition (5) is satisfied.<br>
In this case, a period from a time when the positive<br>
judgment is provided in Step S56 after the vehicle speed<br>
once becomes not lower than the predetermined speed is<br>
measured (Step S57), and the FI controller 70 judges<br>
whether the measured period reaches the predetermined<br>
period (e.g., 3 seconds) (Step S58) . If YES in Step S58,<br><br><br>
the idle stop effectuation conditions (2) and (6) are<br>
satisfied and, consequently, all the idle stop<br>
effectuation conditions (1) to (6) are satisfied.<br>
Therefore, the FI controller 70 judges that the idle stop<br>
operation is to be performed (Step S59).<br>
Fig. 10 is a flow chart of an exemplary sub-routine<br>
for the idle stop cancellation judgment (Step S29 in Fig.<br>
7). The FI controller 70 judges whether the engine 15<br>
is in the idle stop state (Step S71). This judgment may<br>
be based on whether the idle stop flag is set. If the<br>
idle stop operation is not performed (NO in Step S71),<br>
the sub-routine returns to the main routine shown in Fig.<br>
7.<br>
If the idle stop operation is performed (YES in<br>
Step S71), the FI controller 70 judges whether the<br>
unbraking operation is performed for the restart (Step<br>
S72). If the unbraking operation is performed for the<br>
restart (YES in Step S72), the FI controller 70 judges<br>
that the idle stop cancellation condition (1) is satisfied,<br>
and outputs the start request (Step S77). Then, the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If the braking operation continues (NO in Step S72 ) ,<br>
the FI controller 70 judges whether a condition that the<br>
throttle opening degree is not lower than the<br>
predetermined opening degree is satisfied (Step S73).<br><br><br>
If YES in Step S73 (the throttle opening degree is not<br>
lower than the predetermined opening degree), the FI<br>
controller 70 judges that the idle stop cancellation<br>
condition (2) is satisfied, and outputs the start request<br>
(Step S77) . Then, the sub-routine returns to the main<br>
routine.<br>
If NO in Step S73 (the throttle opening degree is<br>
lower than the predetermined opening degree), the FI<br>
controller 70 further judges whether the starter switch<br>
36 is turned on (Step S74) . If the starter switch 36 is<br>
on (YES in Step S74), the FI controller 70 judges that<br>
the idle stop cancellation condition (3) is satisfied,<br>
and outputs the start request (Step S77). Then, the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If the starter switch 36 is off (NO in Step S74),<br>
the FI controller 70 judges whether the battery voltage<br>
is lower than the predetermined voltage level (Step S75) .<br>
If the battery voltage is lower than the predetermined<br>
voltage level (YES in Step S75), the FI controller 70<br>
judges that the idle stop cancellation condition (5) is<br>
satisfied, and outputs the start request (Step S77) . Then,<br>
the sub-routine returns to the main routine.<br>
If the battery voltage is not lower than the<br>
predetermined voltage level (NO in Step S75), the FI<br>
controller 70 judges whether the engine temperature is<br><br>
lower than the predetermined temperature level (StepS76) .<br>
If the engine temperature is lower than the predetermined<br>
temperature level (YES in Step S76), the FI controller<br>
70 judges that the idle stop cancellation condition (4)<br>
is satisfied, and outputs the start request (Step S77).<br>
Then, the sub-routine returns to the main routine. If<br>
the engine temperature is not lower than the predetermined<br>
temperature level (NO in Step S76), the idle stop<br>
cancellation condition (4) is not satisfied, so that the<br>
sub-routine returns to the main routine without outputting<br>
the start request.<br>
In this process, the start request is output when<br>
at least one of the idle stop cancellation conditions<br>
(1) to (5) is satisfied. Thus, the judgment in Step S17<br>
of Fig. 7 is positive, so that the engine 15 is restarted.<br>
Fig. 11 is a flow chart of a specific example of<br>
the unbfaking judgment process (Step S72 in Fig. 10).<br>
The FI controller 70 first compares a brake state code<br>
(current brake state code) detected in a current control<br>
cycle in the brake state detecting process (Step S6 in<br>
Fig. 7) with the brake state code stored in the memory<br>
70M (Step S81) . If a condition that the brake state code<br>
stored in the memory 70M is not greater than the brake<br>
state code detected in the current control cycle is<br>
satisfied (YES in Step S81) , the FI controller 70 replaces<br><br><br>
the brake state code stored in the memory 70M with the<br>
brake state code detected in the current control cycle<br>
(Step S82) , and the sub-routine returns to the sub-routine<br>
shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The idle stop operation is not performed (see Step<br>
S52 in Fig. 9) if the brake state code is "00". Therefore,<br>
the judgment in Step S81 is positive if the brake state<br>
code is changed or maintained in the following manner.<br>
01 → 01<br>
01 → 10<br>
01 → 11<br>
10 → 10<br>
10	 → 11<br>
11	 → 11<br>
In these cases, the state of the front brake unit<br>
12 associated with the right grip (accelerator grip) 28<br>
is not changed, or the state of the front brake unit 12<br>
is changed from the unbraking state to the braking state.<br>
Therefore, it is reasonable to judge that the driver has<br>
no intention to restart the vehicle and, therefore, there<br>
is no need to restart the engine.<br>
On the other hand, the judgment in Step S81 is<br>
negative if the brake state code is changed in the following<br>
manner.<br>
01 → 00<br><br><br>
10 → 00<br>
10 → 01<br>
11 → 00<br>
11 → 01<br>
11 → 10<br>
If NO in Step S81 (the brake state code stored in<br>
the memory 70M is greater than the brake state code in<br>
the current control cycle), the FI controller 70 judges<br>
whether the brake state code in the current control cycle<br>
is "00" in binary notation (or "0" in decimal notation)<br>
(Step S83) . If the brake state code is "00" (YES in Step<br>
S83), both the front brake unit 12 and the rear brake<br>
unit 13 are in the unbraking state. Therefore, the FI<br>
controller 70 judges that the unbraking operation is<br>
performed (Step S85), and the sub-routine returns to the<br>
sub-routine shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The brake state code detected in the current control<br>
cycle is not "00" (NO in Step S83) if the brake state<br>
code is changed in the following manner.<br>
10	 → 01<br>
11	 → 01<br>
11 → 10<br>
If the brake state code detected in the current<br>
control cycle is "01", the front brake unit 12 associated<br>
with the right grip (accelerator grip) 28 is in the<br><br><br>
unbraking state. Therefore, it is reasonable to judge<br>
that the driver intends to start the vehicle. However,<br>
if the brake state code is changed from "11" to "10",<br>
the front brake unit 12 is still in the braking state<br>
and, therefore, it is unreasonable to judge that the driver<br>
intends to start the vehicle. Therefore, the FI<br>
controller 70 judges whether the brake state code detected<br>
in the current control cycle is "01" in binary notation<br>
(Step S84). If this judgment is positive, the FI<br>
controller 70 judges that the unbraking operation is<br>
performed (SteD S85) and the sub-routine returns to the<br>
sub-routine shown in Fig. 10. If the judgment in Step<br>
S84 is negative, the sub-routine skips Step S85 to return<br>
to the sub-routine shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Particularly, where the driver starts the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle 1 on an upward slope, the driver<br>
performs the accelerating operation by the right grip<br>
28 while preventing reverse movement of the vehicle 1<br>
by actuating the rear brake unit 13. Therefore, the<br>
engine can be started as intended by the driver by primarily<br>
detecting the deactuation of the front brake unit 12.<br>
Thus, the engine can be properly started even on the upward<br>
slope.<br>
Fig. 12 is a flow chart of a sub-routine for the<br>
headlight dimming process (Step S28 in Fig. 7). The FI<br><br>
controller 70 first judges whether the turn switch is<br>
on (Step S1001). If the turn switch is off (NO in Step<br>
S1001), the PWM duty ratio of the PWM control circuit<br>
65 which controls the light amount of the headlight 63<br>
of the two-wheeled vehicle 1 is set at a predetermined<br>
level A1 (
engine 15, the PWM control circuit 65 uses a PWM duty<br>
ratio of 100%.<br>
On the other hand, if the turn switch is on (YES<br>
in Step S1001), the PWM duty ratio of the PWM control<br>
circuit 65 for the control of the light amount of the<br>
headlight 63 of the two-wheeled vehicle 1 is set at a<br>
predetermined level A2 (&gt;A1) (Step S1003). After Step<br>
S1002 or S1003, the headlight dimming process ends.<br>
Here, the PWM duty ratio is set as satisfying a<br>
relationship A1<a2 for example the level al is></a2>
set to 50%. Thus, when the engine 15 is in the idle stop<br>
state, the power supply to the headlight 63 is reduced.<br>
When the turn switch is on, the headlight dimming process<br>
is not performed (A2 = 100%) for safety of the driver, or<br>
a dimming ratio is reduced.<br>
Where the headlight 63 includes two lamps, the<br>
headlight dimming process may be performed by turning<br>
off one of the two lamps.<br>
Fig. 13 is a flow chart of a sub-routine for the<br><br><br>
headlight restoration process (Step S23 in Fig. 7) . The<br>
FI controller 70 first judges whether a condition that<br>
the vehicle speed is not lower than a predetermined speed<br>
is satisfied (Step S1401). If YES in Step S1401 (the<br>
- vehicle speed is not lower than the predetermined speed),<br>
the PWM duty ratio for the PWM control of the headlight<br>
63 of the two-wheeled vehicle lisset to 100% (StepS 1402).<br>
If NO in Step S1401 (the vehicle speed is lower<br>
than the predetermined speed) or after Step S1402, the<br>
headlight restoration process ends.<br>
In the two-wheeled vehicle 1 including the fuel<br>
injection type engine 15 according to this embodiment,<br>
the engine 15 once brought into the idle stop state is<br>
restarted when the deactuation of the front brake unit<br>
12 or the rear brake unit 13 is detected (the unbraking<br>
is detected). Therefore, the engine restart based on the<br>
detection of the unbraking requires a shorter period of<br>
time than the engine restart based on the detection of<br>
the increase in throttle opening degree. This is because,<br>
in the case of the saddle type vehicle such as the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle 1, the operation of the accelerator<br>
(for throttle up) is usually performed after the<br>
unbraking.<br>
Further, the restart of the engine 15 based on the<br>
detection of the unbraking does not necessarily require<br><br><br>
the throttle position sensor 46. Therefore, this<br>
embodiment is applicable to a vehicle having no throttle<br>
position sensor 46.<br>
Since the restart of the engine 15 is based on the<br>
-detection of the unbraking, the engine 15 is started when<br>
the driver releases the front brake lever 30 or the rear<br>
brake lever 29 to. walk away from the vehicle. This<br>
prevents the driver from leaving the vehicle 1 when the<br>
vehicle is in the idle stop state and, hence, is effective<br>
for theft prevention of the two-wheeled vehicle 1.<br>
Since the engine 15 is restarted in response to<br>
the unbraking, the fuel injection amount at the restart<br>
of the engine can be properly adjusted. That is, when<br>
the unbraking is detected, the accelerator (throttle)<br>
is substantially fully closed. The intake air amount of<br>
the engine depends on the throttle opening degree and<br>
the cranking rate. Therefore, the intake air amount of<br>
the engine can be more easily estimated when the throttle<br>
is fully closed than when the throttle is opened. Hence,<br>
the fuel injection amount at the restart of the engine<br>
can be more easily determined by restarting the engine<br>
15 when the unbraking is detected, i.e., when the throttle<br>
is in the fully closed state. Thus, a proper fuel<br>
injection amount is provided. Since the proper fuel<br>
injection amount is provided at the restart of the engine<br><br><br>
15, the air-to-fuel ratio is properly determined. Thus,<br>
the engine 15 is more advantageously restarted from the<br>
idle stop.<br>
Since the proper fuel injection amount {hence, the<br>
proper air-to-fuel ratio) is provided at the restart of<br>
r<br>
the engine 15, the fuel injection amount is reduced. That<br>
is, needless fuel injection is suppressed at the restart<br>
of the engine, thereby improving fuel economy. Since the<br>
proper fuel injection amount and the proper air-to-fuel<br>
ratio are provided, it is possible to suppress generation<br>
of toxic exhaust gas components at the restart of the<br>
engine.<br>
In this embodiment, where the engine 15 is brought<br>
into the idle stop state by actuation of both the front<br>
brake unit 12 and the rear brake unit 13, the engine 15<br>
is restarted upon the detection of the deactuation of<br>
the front brake unit 12 . Thus, the vehicle can be properly<br>
started even on an upward slope. In general, when the<br>
vehicle is stopped on a slope, both the front brake unit<br>
12 and the rear brake unit 13 are actuated. Particularly<br>
on an upward slope, the vehicle is started typically by<br>
deactuating the front brake unit 12 with the rear brake<br>
unit 13 kept actuated for prevention of reverse movement<br>
of the vehicle 1, and then operating the accelerator (for<br>
throttle up). Therefore, the deactuation of the front<br><br><br>
brake unit 12 is primarily detected for the start of the<br>
vehicle on the upward slope.<br>
The front brake lever 30 for the front brake unit<br>
12 is provided adjacent to the right grip (accelerator<br>
grip) 28. By restarting the engine upon the detection<br>
of the deactuation of the front brake unit 12, the time<br>
required for the restart of the engine is reduced because<br>
of earlier detection timing, as compared with the restart<br>
of the engine based on the detection of the throttle opening<br>
degree.<br>
Where the engine 15 is brought into the idle stop<br>
state by actuating one of the front brake unit 12 and<br>
the rear brake unit 13, the engine 15 once brought into<br>
the idle stop state is restarted upon detection of<br>
deactuation of the one brake unit. Thus, the engine 15<br>
is reliably and speedily restarted as intended by the<br>
driver.<br>
In this embodiment, the engine 15 once brought into<br>
the idle stop state is restarted upon detection of a<br>
throttle opening degree not lower than the predetermined<br>
opening degree irrespective of the brake states of the<br>
brake units 12, 13. Therefore, the engine once brought<br>
into the idle stop state, for example, when the vehicle<br>
is stopped only by the rear brake on the upward slope,<br>
can be restarted simply by operating the accelerator (for<br><br>
throttle up).<br>
Further, when the starter switch 36 is turned on,<br>
the engine 15 once brought into the idle stop state is<br>
restarted irrespective of the brake states of the brake<br>
units 12, 13. Therefore, the engine 15 can be restarted<br>
by an ordinary starting operation.<br>
When an engine temperature not higher than the<br>
predetermined temperature level is detected, the engine<br>
15 once brought into the idle stop state is restarted<br>
irrespective of the brake states of the brake units 12,<br>
13. This prevents reduction of the engine temperature<br>
to ensure proper restart of the engine 15.<br>
When a battery voltage not higher than the<br>
predetermined voltage level is detected, the engine 15<br>
once brought into the idle stop state is restarted<br>
irrespective of the brake states of the brake units 12,<br>
13. This prevents reduction of the battery voltage to<br>
ensure proper restart of the engine 15.<br>
When the engine 15 is in the idle stop state, the<br>
duty ratio of the PWM control circuit 65 for the control<br>
of the light amount of the headlight 63 is adjusted to<br>
reduce the power supply to the headlight 63. Therefore,<br>
the electric power of the battery 75 consumed by the<br>
lighting of the headlight 63 can be reduced when the engine<br>
is in the idle stop state.<br><br><br>
Second embodiment<br>
Fig. 14 is a diagram illustrating connection<br>
between an FI controller of an idle stop system and a<br>
starter motor (cell motor) in a two-wheeled vehicle<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The FI controller 70 shown in Fig. 14 receives the same<br>
input signals as those input to the FI controller 70 of<br>
the idle stop system in the two-wheeled vehicle according<br>
to the first embodiment and, therefore, no repetitious<br>
explanation will be provided. In this embodiment, a<br>
reference is also made to Fig. 3.<br>
In the two-wheeled vehicle according to the first<br>
embodiment, the FI controller 70 outputs the start request<br>
to the ISG controller 71 when the starter signal is detected<br>
or at least one of the idle stop cancellation conditions<br>
is satisfied.<br>
On the other hand, the two-wheeled vehicle<br>
according to the second embodiment is designed so that<br>
the engine 15 is restarted by operating a relay of the<br>
starter motor 18 without the use of the ISG controller<br>
71. This eliminates the need for the provision of the<br>
expensive ISG controller, thereby providing the<br>
two-wheeled vehicle at lower costs.<br>
An injector (INJ) 60, an ignition coil (IGN) 61,<br>
a fuel pump 62 and a headlight 63 (more specifically,<br><br><br>
a PWM control circuit 65) are connected to output terminals<br>
of the FI controller 70. The starter motor 18 is also<br>
connected to an output terminal of the FI controller 70<br>
via a starter relay 90.<br>
The starter relay 90 includes a driving circuit<br>
which includes a starter switch 36, a main switch 34,<br>
a front brake switch 57, a rear brake switch 58, a battery<br>
75, diodes D1, D2 and resistance R1.<br>
More specifically, the starter relay 90 includes<br>
a relay coil 91 connected at one end thereof to the battery<br>
7 5 via a supply line 95A and the main switch 34 and connected<br>
at the other end thereof to the FI controller 70 via a<br>
driving signal line 95B. In the starter relay 90, the<br>
relay coil 91 is excited by a starter relay driving signal<br>
output from the FI controller 70 when the main switch<br>
34 is on (conductive), whereby a relay switch (contact<br>
piece) 92 is turned on.<br>
On the other hand, the front brake switch 57 and<br>
the rear brake switch 58 are each connected at one end<br>
thereof to the supply line 95A, and respectively connected<br>
at the other ends to anodes of the diodes D1, D2, so that<br>
the brake states can be detected on the anode sides of<br>
the diodes D1, D2. Cathodes of the diodes D1, D2 are<br>
connected to one end of the starter switch 36 via the<br>
resistance R1, and the other end of the starter switch<br><br><br>
36 is grounded. The electric potentials of the anode<br>
sides of the diodes D1, D2 are used as a front brake signal<br>
and a rear brake signal, respectively, and are applied<br>
to the FI controller 70. Therefore, when one of the front<br>
brake switch 57 and the rear brake switch 58 is turned<br>
on with the main switch 34 being on (conductive), the<br>
FI controller 70 can detect it.<br>
The electric potential at between the starter<br>
switch 36 and the resistance R1 is usedas a starter signal,<br>
and is applied to the FI controller 70. Therefore, when<br>
one of the front brake switch 57 and the rear brake switch<br>
58 is turned on and the starter switch 36 is operated<br>
to be turned on, the FI controller 70 detects it. In<br>
response to it, the FI controller 70 outputs the starter<br>
relay driving signal to excite the relay coil 91. The<br>
relay switch 92 is turned on, accordingly.<br>
With the relay switch 92 being on, the voltage of<br>
the battery 75 is applied to the starter motor 18, which<br>
is in turn rotated to start the engine 15.<br>
It is herein assumed that the starter switch 36<br>
is operated to start the engine 15, for example, in a<br>
cold state or for the first time after the turn on of<br>
the main switch 34. When the braking operation is<br>
performed, at least one of the front brake switch 57 and<br>
the rear brake switch 58 is on. Therefore, the relay coil<br><br><br>
91 of the starter relay 90 is energized by turning on<br>
the starter switch 36. Thus, the starter motor 18 is<br>
energized via the starter relay 90 to start the engine.<br>
On the other hand, when the driver does not perform the<br>
braking operation and therefore neither the front brake<br>
signal nor the rear brake signal is applied to the FI<br>
controller 70, the FI controller 70 does not output the<br>
starter relay driving signal even with the starter switch<br>
36 being on. Therefore, the relaycoil 91 is not energized<br>
and the starter motor 18 is not actuated. Hence, the<br>
braking operation is essential for the start of the engine<br>
15 by the operation of the starter switch 36.<br>
On the other hand, if the main switch 34 is on,<br>
the relay coil 91 of the starter relay 90 can be energized<br>
by applying the starter relay driving signal from the<br>
FI controller 70. For restarting the engine 15 once<br>
automatically brought into the idle stop state, the<br>
starter relay driving signal is output from the FI<br>
controller 70 when a predetermined restart condition is<br>
satisfied (e.g., the FI controller 70 detects the<br>
unbraking). Thus, the relay coil 91 is energized to turn<br>
on the relay switch 92, whereby the voltage of the battery<br>
75 is applied to the starter motor 18, which is in turn<br>
rotated to restart the engine 15.<br>
This embodiment achieves the same effects as the<br><br><br>
first embodiment described above.<br>
The idle stop system of the two-wheeled vehicle<br>
according to this embodiment may use an ignition<br>
controller (igniter) 170 instead of the FI controller<br>
70 as shown in Fig. 15 to perform the same operations<br>
as described above. The idle stop system shown in Fig.<br>
15 has substantially the same construction as the idle<br>
stop system shown in Fig. 14, except that the igniter<br>
170 is used instead of the FI controller 70. Therefore,<br>
no repetitious explanation will be provided.<br>
The idle stop system having the construction shown<br>
in Fig. 15 is also applicable to a two-wheeled vehicle<br>
having a non-fuel-injection type engine, i.e., a<br>
carburetor type engine. The engine once brought into the<br>
idle stop state is restarted by the unbraking, allowing<br>
S for speedy start of the vehicle.<br>
While the embodiments of the present invention have<br>
thus been described, the present invention may be embodied<br>
in any other way. The embodiments described above are<br>
directed to the two-wheeled vehicle 1, but the present<br>
invention is applicable to other saddle type vehicles<br>
including a three-wheeled vehicle, for example.<br>
While the present invention has been described in<br>
detail by way of the embodiments thereof, it should be<br>
understood that the foregoing disclosure is merely<br><br><br>
illustrative of the technical principles of the present<br>
invention but not limitative of the same. The spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention are to be limited only<br>
by the appended claims.<br>
