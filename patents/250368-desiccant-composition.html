DESICCANT COMPOSITION<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Field of Invention.<br>
This invention relates to desiccant containers. More<br>
specifically, this invention relates to a composition of<br>
material for use in a desiccant container comprising a<br>
combination of a deliquescent salt and a modified starch.<br>
Prior Art.<br>
Desiccant containers which absorb water vapor, water,<br>
liquids and the like are well known in the art. Generally,<br>
these containers are comprised of a water or water vapor<br>
permeable packaging material formed from fibrous or film<br>
products securely sealed together at the edges of the<br>
packaging. The packaging material encapsulates a desiccant<br>
material, such as silica gel. The volume of water or water<br>
vapor absorbed by the desiccant container is generally<br>
determined by the absorbent capacity of the desiccant<br>
material contained within the container and the temperature<br>
and relative humidity level of the surrounding air.<br>
One type of desiccant container absorbs both water<br>
vapor and liquid water by permitting both to pass through<br>
the packaging material to be absorbed by the desiccant<br>
material. In some circumstances, the packaging material for<br>
this type of product dissolves to permit the desiccant<br>
material contained within the desiccant container to have<br>
direct contact with the liquid.<br>
Another type of desiccant container absorbs water vapor<br>
but not liquid water. The packaging material for this type<br>
of desiccant container is designed to prevent water absorbed<br>
within the desiccant container as water vapor from being<br>
released from the desiccant container in the form of liquid<br>
water.<br>
There are many common products that are utilized as<br>
desiccating agents. Among the most common used include<br>
silica gel, calcium sulfate, calcium fluoride, activated<br>
charcoal, molecular sieves, lithium chloride, calcium<br>
chloride and other such products. A common list of drying<br>
agents is contained, for example, in Kirk-Othmer,<br>
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. Volume 7, pages 3 78-<br>
398. Common desiccating agents for use in conventional<br>
desiccant containers are also disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,114,003, which discloses the use of a montmorillonite<br>
clay, silica gel, molecular s,ieve, calcium oxide, calcium<br>
sulfate and calcium chloride. The use of silica gel,<br>
alumino silicate, alumina, activated charcoal and molecular<br>
sieves as desiccating agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,464,261.<br>
Commercial grade calcium chloride is a widely used<br>
desiccant due to its low cost and high degree of<br>
hygroscopicity. Calcium chloride compacted in the form of<br>
particles or beads is used as a drying agent, for example,<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 3,923,944.<br>
Mixtures and combinations of other materials have been<br>
blended with calcium chloride to form desiccating products.<br>
For example, polyethylene glycol was mixed with calcium<br>
chloride to form a desiccant product in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,779,936. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 3,334,468 discloses<br>
the use of sodium chloride or sodium carbonate with calcium<br>
chloride. Further, the combination of calcium chloride with<br>
magnesium, lithium or ammonium salts is disclosed, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent No. 3,885,926. The use of calcium<br>
chloride with a metal, for example, iron fillings, is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 1,798,862. Further, the use of<br>
activated carbon with calcium chloride as a desiccant<br>
product is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,027,093.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,390,511 discloses the use of calcium<br>
chloride placed on a carrier material for use as a gas dryer<br>
desiccant. The preferred material that is utilized as the<br>
carrier for the calcium chloride is sodium chloride. See<br>
also, U.S. Patent No. 3,334,468. The desiccant product in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,390,511 preferably comprised about 90 to<br>
97 percent sodium chloride as the carrier and about 10 to<br>
about 3 percent calcium chloride. In addition, sodium<br>
dichromate and trisodiun phosphate in minor amounts may be<br>
included in the product. While the preferred carrier for<br>
the calcium chloride was sodium chloride, other disclosed<br>
carriers included sugar, potassium chloride, potassium<br>
nitrate, sodium nitrate and starch. See column 3, line 33.<br>
The percentage of calcium chloride used in this product was<br>
10 percent or less, because the major component of the<br>
product was the carrier.<br>
One of the problems in the utilization of calcium<br>
chloride as a desiccating agent is that when the water is<br>
absorbed, it forms a liquid mixture on the surface of the<br>
calcium chloride. This is discussed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,334,468. With conventional desiccant products this liquid<br>
may leak from the packaging which can cause problems, for<br>
example, if the desiccant product is used in storage<br>
containers.<br>
There are situations where absorption of moisture by a<br>
desiccant product even at low humidity and low water vapor<br>
pressure is necessary, such as when the product protected by<br>
the desiccant product can be damaged by moisture. Usually<br>
traditional desiccants, such as desiccant clays, silica gel,<br>
molecular sieve and calcium sulfate are used in this<br>
situation. However, for some applications the capacity for<br>
absorption of moisture of these desiccant products is too<br>
low. An example where this problem can occur is the<br>
shipment of steel products overseas. In order to avoid the<br>
rusting of these steel products, it is important that the<br>
relative humidity level in the container holding those steel<br>
products be maintained below about 40 percent at 25°C. for<br>
as long as several weeks. While conventional desiccant<br>
products, such as silica gel, can be effective in absorbing<br>
moisture in some situations, they do not have the high<br>
capacity for absorption that is necessary for extended<br>
periods of time. Desiccant products with a higher capacity<br>
for absorption at humidity levels below 40 percent relative<br>
humidity are needed in this situation.<br>
In other situations conventional desiccant products<br>
begin to absorb moisture at relative humidity levels which<br>
are unnecessarily low. In these situations a considerable<br>
portion of the absorption capacity of the desiccant product<br>
is wasted because moisture is absorbed at humidity levels<br>
where no damage can occur to the products being shipped with<br>
the desiccant product. In addition, if the humidity level<br>
then rises, there is a risk that these conventional<br>
desiccant products will not have sufficient remaining<br>
absorption capacity to absorb water vapor and protect the<br>
products being shipped.<br>
In addition, it is sometimes difficult to utilize<br>
conventional desiccant products with products which<br>
inherently have a high moisture content, such as cocoa,<br>
coffee, tobacco and dog food. If the desiccant product<br>
absorbs too much moisture at relatively low humidity levels,<br>
these products may be damaged. Further, the high capacity<br>
of some desiccant products to absorb moisture is wasted in<br>
these situations. In addition, there is a risk that not<br>
enough absorption capacity will be available during the<br>
entire shipping process, especially when the humidity level<br>
rises.<br>
While certain references disclose the use of calcium<br>
chloride and other deliquescent salts as a desiccant either<br>
alone or in combination with a number of different<br>
compositions, there is still a need for improved desiccant<br>
products utilizing calcium chloride and other deliquescent<br>
salts.<br>
In addition, there is a need for a desiccant<br>
composition which can be useful in both low humidity and<br>
high humidity applications.<br>
Therefore it is an object of this invention to disclose<br>
a desiccant composition containing calcium chloride and/or<br>
other deliquescent salts as its major component.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition containing calcium chloride<br>
or other deliquescent salts mixed with a significant amount<br>
of a modified starch to form the desiccant composition.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition contained within a<br>
packaging material, wherein the desiccant composition is a<br>
combination of calcium chloride or other deliquescent salts<br>
and a modified starch.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition containing calcium chloride<br>
or other deliquescent salts where water absorbed does not<br>
provided a desiccant composition comprising calcium chloride<br>
and/or other deliquescent salts and a modified starch,<br>
wherein the calcium chloride and/or other deliquescent salts<br>
comprises at least about 5 to about 95 percent of the<br>
composition by weight and the modified starch from about 5<br>
to about 95 percent of composition. In the preferred<br>
embodiment calcium chloride and/or other deliquescent salts<br>
comprises from about 20 to about 95 percent of the<br>
composition by weight while the modified starch comprises<br>
from about 5 to about 80 percent of the composition by<br>
weight.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Although the invention is adaptable to a wide variety<br>
of uses, it is shown in the drawings for the purpose of<br>
illustration as embodied in a desiccant container (10) for<br>
absorbing and immobilizing a liquid comprised of a desiccant<br>
packaging material (12) encapsulating a liquid absorbing and<br>
immobilizing desiccant material (14).<br>
The desiccant packaging material (12) may comprise any<br>
conventional packaging material. Preferably, it comprises<br>
a laminated film layer (16) with an inner (18) and outer<br>
(20) surface preferably formed from an uncoated microporous<br>
or nonwoven film layer sealed to an uncoated, water vapor<br>
permeable laminate film (22) with an inner (24) and outer<br>
(26) surface. The inner surface of the layers are sealed at<br>
the edges.<br>
Conventional microporous or nonwoven films used for the<br>
manufacture of a laminated packaging material have been<br>
formed into a composite film bonded to another layer of<br>
material. Conventionally, the bonding of the two layers is<br>
accomplished by the use of an adhesive which coats one or<br>
both of the inside surfaces of the layers. It has been<br>
surprisingly discovered that strong, laminated desiccant<br>
packaging materials can be produced from uncoated<br>
microporous or nonwoven films.<br>
The uncoated microporous or nonwoven film (16)<br>
comprises a film having a plurality of fine openings, which<br>
film is gas permeable, but water impermeable when there is<br>
no difference between the air pressure outside of the film<br>
and inside of the film. The size of the openings is<br>
preferably in the range of about 0.01 to 50 microns. The<br>
uncoated microporous or nonwoven film may constitute a<br>
single film layer or may comprise a laminate of separate<br>
microporous film layers. Preferably the film is a single<br>
layer microporous film formed from a polyolefinic material,<br>
such as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(fluorinated<br>
ethylene), ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene acrylic ester<br>
and the like. The uncoated microporous or nonwoven film may<br>
be prepared by any conventional film forming process<br>
including cold orientation of the film, orientation of<br>
different substance-containing films, extraction of<br>
different substances from different substance-containing<br>
films, extraction of different substance-containing film<br>
followed by orientation of the treated film, cross-<br>
dispersing of a bundle of fibers followed by heat-pressing<br>
the resulting film and any other conventional procedures<br>
utilized for the formation of a microporous film. Many such<br>
microporous films are commercially available and are sold,<br>
for example, under the name Celgard® (Hoechst Celanese<br>
Corporation), GORE-TEX (Gore &amp; Co. Gmbh) and Tyvek® (E.I.<br>
DuPont) . The preferred microporous film has a Gurley-type<br>
air permeability of about 0.01 to 10,000 sec/100<br>
milliliters, preferably 1 to i,000 second/100 milliliters<br>
and most preferably less than about 400 seconds/100<br>
milliliters. Preferably, the microporous film is a<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene-based microporous film and<br>
most preferably a polyethylene spun-bonded paper such as<br>
Tyvek® 1025 BL, 1059B or 107337B manufactured by E.I.<br>
DuPont, or a polypropylene based film, such as GDT II and<br>
GDT IV manufactured by San Ai, Ltd. of Osaka, Japan.<br>
The second layer of the desiccant packaging material is<br>
preferably formed from the uncoated laminate film (22). The<br>
laminate film can be formed of conventional polymeric<br>
materials. The critical aspect of the composition of the<br>
laminate film is that its inner surface (24) , which is<br>
bonded to the inner surface (18) of the uncoated microporous<br>
or nonwoven film layer at the edges of the packaging<br>
material, must be comprised of materials which are<br>
compatible with the composition of the inner surface of the<br>
microporous or nonwoven film layer. Materials that can be<br>
used to form this laminate film include conventional<br>
polyolefinic materials such as polyolefinic polypropylene,<br>
polyolefinic polyethylene, polyesters and the like.<br>
Preferably, the uncoated laminate film has a lower moisture<br>
vapor transmission rate than the microporous or nonwoven<br>
film. Also preferably the softening temperature of the<br>
uncoated laminate film is lower than or equal to the<br>
softening temperature of the inner surface of the uncoated<br>
microporous film. Preferably the laminate film is comprised<br>
of a laminated film comprising a high melting or softening<br>
point material, such as polyester, located on one side<br>
laminated to a lower melting point material, such as<br>
polypropylene on the opposite side. Examples of acceptable<br>
laminate film include, for example, RPP91-1964 or RPP-31-<br>
1007a manufactured by RollPrint.<br>
The outer surface (26) of the laminate film are<br>
preferably formed from materials which are incompatible with<br>
the microporous layer, such as materials having a higher<br>
melting or softening point than that of the inner surface of<br>
the microporous film, such as polyester material. In<br>
contrast, the inner surface of the laminate film (24) must<br>
be formed from a material which is compatible with the inner<br>
surface (18) of the microporous film. By having the two<br>
inner surfaces formed from compatible materials, a strong<br>
bond is formed between those layers when they are heat<br>
sealed together.<br>
"Compatible" means that the materials mix on a<br>
molecular scale and will crystallize homogeneously. Thus,<br>
while such layers may not have precisely the same softening<br>
point, they should have softening points which are<br>
consistent, so that the materials will mix on a molecular<br>
level. Compatible bonds generally have a bond strength of<br>
at least about 0.9 Kg/cm (5 lb./in.) or more. For example,<br>
the compatible materials may include high density, low<br>
density, or linear low-density polyethylenes as well as<br>
nonoriented, bi-axially oriented or laminated<br>
polypropylenes. In contrast, the outer surface of at least<br>
the laminate film should be manufactured from incompatible<br>
materials such as polyester or nylon or a polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene material with a higher softening point than<br>
the inner surface of the laminate film material.<br>
In addition, it is also critical that the inner surface<br>
of both the laminate film and the microporous or nonwoven<br>
film be uncoated with an adhesive. Coated film, when sealed<br>
to other coated or uncoated films, frequently form poor<br>
quality, weak seals. In addition, the sealing machines used<br>
for sealing coated films are also more expensive and more<br>
difficult to operate, resulting in greater expense for the<br>
manufacture of sealing coated films. Further, uncoated<br>
films are generally less expensive than coated films,<br>
sometimes by as much as 50 percent.<br>
Suitable materials for use as the desiccant material to<br>
be incorporated into the desiccant package include<br>
conventional desiccating material such as silica gel, clays,<br>
natural or synthetic zeolites, calcium chloride, alkali<br>
metal carboxylate salts of starch - polyacrylonitrile,<br>
sodium polyacrylate, various deliquescent salts, wherein the<br>
anions include nitrate, nitrite, chloride, bromide,<br>
fluoride, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, carbonate,<br>
carboxylate, phosphate and iodide and wherein the cations<br>
include ammonium, alkali, alkaline earth, earth and<br>
transition metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium,<br>
rubidium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium,<br>
aluminum, zinc, and iron and other desiccating products that<br>
absorb, gel or thicken upon contact with water or water<br>
vapor. If low humidity applications are desired (relative<br>
humidity less than about 20 percent), the deliquescent<br>
salts include zinc chloride, lithium chloride, zinc bromide,<br>
lithium bromide, zinc iodide and lithium iodide. When<br>
medium to high humidity applications are desired (greater<br>
than 20 percent relative humidity), the deliquescent salts<br>
may include CaCl2, MgCl2, Zn(NO3)2, and K2 (CO3) *2H2O. When<br>
high humidity applications are desired (higher than 50<br>
percent relative humidity), the deliquescent salts may<br>
include (NH4)2SO4, NH4C1. Ca(NO3)2*2H2O, Mg (NO3) *6H2O, K2HPO4,<br>
NH4H2PO,, KHSO4, Na2CO3*10H2O, ZnSO4*7H20, Na (C3H3O2) *3H2O,<br>
Na2S2O3, KBr, Na2SO3*7H2O, KI, Nal, NaNO2. NaF and NaHSO4.<br>
It has been surprisingly discovered that a preferred<br>
desiccant material can be produced from a mixture of a<br>
deliquescent salt, such as those previously discussed, and<br>
a modified starch, most preferably a modified corn starch,<br>
such as MIRA-SPERSE® 623, 626 and 629 produced by A.E.<br>
Staley Manufacturing Company. The composition of this<br>
desiccant material is preferably about 5 to about 95 percent<br>
the deliquescent salt mixed with about 95 to about 5 percent<br>
of the modified starch. Preferably, the deliquescent salt<br>
comprises about 20 to about 95 percent while the modified<br>
starch comprises about 80 to about 5 percent of the<br>
composition. Most preferably the deliquescent salt<br>
comprises about 50 to about 80 percent while the modified<br>
starch comprises about 50 to about 20 percent of the<br>
composition.<br>
In low humidity applications (less than 20 percent<br>
relative humidity) the preferred deliquescent salts in order<br>
of preference are: LiCl&gt;ZnCl2&gt;ZnBr2&gt;LiBr&gt;ZnI2&gt;LiI. In medium<br>
to high humidity applications (greater than 20 percent<br>
relative humidity) the deliquescent salts in order of<br>
preference are: CaCl2 = MgCl2, &gt; K2(CO3)*2H2O &gt; (Zn(NO3)2. In<br>
high humidity applications (greater than 50 percent relative<br>
humidity) the deliquescent salts in order of preference are:<br>
NH4Cl, Na2CO3*10H2O, (NH4)2SO4, Ca (NO3) 2*2H2O, Mg(NO3) *6H2O,<br>
K2HPO4, NH4H2PO4, ZnSO4*7H20, Na(C3H3O2) *3H2O, Na2S2O3, KBr,<br>
Na2SO3*7H2O, KI, Nal, NaNO2, NaF, KHSO4 and NaHSO4.<br>
The modified starches that are utilized in this<br>
invention can include conventionally modified starches,<br>
oxidized starch, enzyme-converted starches and modified<br>
starches containing functional groups such as hydroxyl,<br>
carbonyl, amino and amino groups. The term "starch"<br>
therefore as used throughout this specification and claims<br>
is intended to include any member of the family of starches,<br>
or mixture of two or more starches. The preferred starch is<br>
a modified starch, such as an oxidized, enzyme-converted<br>
starch. The modification to the starch may be chemical,<br>
such as by crosslinking or substitution, or physical, such<br>
as by granulation.<br>
Ordinary starch, such as pearl starch, is not commonly<br>
utilized in its raw state because of its high viscosity and<br>
retrogradation, which is a particular problem with<br>
unmodified starches. These problems are reduced<br>
substantially with modified starches, such as<br>
hydroxyethylated starches. As such, most industries<br>
leak from the desiccant container.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition contained within a<br>
packaging material wherein the desiccant composition<br>
prevents leakage of water from within the package by use of<br>
a modified starch.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition contained within a<br>
packaging material which is designed for absorption of<br>
moisture in order to maintain a relatively low humidity<br>
level.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to<br>
disclose a desiccant composition contained within a<br>
packaging material which is designed for absorption of<br>
moisture in order to maintain a relatively high humidity<br>
level.<br>
These and other objects and features of the present<br>
invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
from a consideration of the following detailed description,<br>
drawings and claims. The description, along with the<br>
accompanying drawings, provides a selected example of the<br>
construction of the product and process to illustrate the<br>
invention.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is<br>
convert their unmodified starches to modified starches, such<br>
as oxidized, enzyme converted, phosphated or<br>
hydroxyethylated starch. Alternatively, a further modified<br>
starch, in the form of a cationic starch, can be used.<br>
However, the cost of such cationic starch is significant in<br>
comparison to either unmodified or starch. Critical to the<br>
choice of starch is its ability to absorb water, preferably<br>
cool water, i.e., less than about 40-50°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the modified starch when<br>
combined with water must have a viscosity greater than water<br>
alone. When measured as Brookfield viscosity, the viscosity<br>
should be at least about 1.0 cps. The critical function<br>
supplied by the modified starch is the ability to mix with<br>
water and thicken or gel water or the deliquescent<br>
salt/water composition formed during the absorption of water<br>
by the deliquescent salt.<br>
The deliquescent salt/corn starch desiccant composition<br>
can be used not only with the desiccant container outlined<br>
above, but also with any conventional desiccant container<br>
utilized for the absorption of water or water vapor.<br>
The process for the formation of the desiccating<br>
container comprises a number of steps. The desiccant<br>
packaging material is first formed. To form the desiccant<br>
packaging material of the instant invention, the uncoated<br>
microporous and nonwoven film (16) is first formed or<br>
acquired from conventional sources. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the microporous film is an uncoated microporous<br>
or non-woven film such as Celgard® produced by Hoechst<br>
Celanese Corporation, Tyvek® Nos. 1025 BL, 1059B and 1073B<br>
produced by E.I. DuPont or certain other polypropylene-based<br>
non-woven films such as GDTI, II, IV produced by San Ai of<br>
Osaka, Japan. As stated above, the permeability of this<br>
microporous film should be in the range of about 1 to about<br>
1,000 Gurley seconds per 100 milliliters and preferably less<br>
than about 400 seconds per 100 milliliters.<br>
Following the formation of the uncoated microporous or<br>
nonwoven film, the uncoated laminate film (22) is formed.<br>
As stated above, this uncoated laminate film can be<br>
comprised of different layers of the same or different<br>
materials laminated together. However, the critical element<br>
of the composition of this material is that the film must be<br>
uncoated and the inner surface (24) of the laminate film,<br>
which is sealed to an inner surface (18) of the microporous<br>
material, must be formed of a material which is "compatible"<br>
with the inner surface of the uncoated microporous or<br>
nonwoven film. In one preferred embodiment, the laminate<br>
film is a laminated film containing a polyester material on<br>
the outer surface with a polypropylene material on the inner<br>
surface, such as RPP 91-1964 made by RollPrint. Another<br>
preferred embodiment is RPP 31-1007A, a polyethylene-based<br>
material also manufactured by RollPrint.<br>
Following the formation of the two layers, the edges of<br>
the layers are sealed together by a conventional heat<br>
sealing procedure. One of the advantages of this product is<br>
that the bond formed between the two compatible, uncoated<br>
materials has a significantly greater strength than<br>
conventional bonds utilizing an adhesive coating. By<br>
utilizing the capability of compatible materials to form a<br>
strong seal without using an adhesive, the strength of the<br>
desiccant packaging material is significantly increased over<br>
conventional packaging materials. In addition, these<br>
uncoated materials have a lower cost of production and run<br>
better through the sealing equipment.<br>
The preferred desiccant material is then placed within<br>
the desiccant packaging. By using the preferred desiccant<br>
material (14) formed from a deliquescent salt and a modified<br>
starch, lesser quantities of the desiccating material may be<br>
necessary than is used in conventional desiccating<br>
containers and still achieve the same level of moisture<br>
absorbency.<br>
The mixture of the deliquescent salt and modified<br>
starch is prepared by placing the two components in a<br>
conventional mixing apparatus, such as tumble mixer or the<br>
two components can be fed directly into the desiccant<br>
packaging from two separate feeds. Other than the physical<br>
mixing of the materials, no additional processing is<br>
necessary for the deliquescent salt/modified starch<br>
composition. This simple mixing of the two materials<br>
produces a desiccant composition with great utility.<br>
Following the addition of the desiccant material to the<br>
desiccant packaging material, the remaining unsealed edges<br>
of the desiccant container are sealed to complete the<br>
formation of the desiccant container.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
The water absorbing capability of a desiccant<br>
combination comprising corn starch with calcium chloride was<br>
tested. 133 grams of a 3 to 1 mixture of calcium chloride<br>
to Mirasperse 629 modified waxy corn starch sold by Staley<br>
Food Ingredients, Decatur, Illinois was placed in a<br>
conventional desiccant bag for a desiccant product, which<br>
product is sold by United Desiccants and known as "CONTAINER<br>
DRI®". The desiccant bag was placed in environmental<br>
chamber of 80 percent relative humidity at 25°C. for about<br>
two months. The results of this test are shown in attached<br>
Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same tests were run on a composition of 1 to 4 corn<br>
starch to calcium chloride utilizing the same type of<br>
Mirasperse 624 modified corn starch as was discussed in<br>
Example 1. The water absorption over time is shown in the<br>
attached Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
The water absorbance of a conventional 500 gram<br>
CONTAINER DRI® desiccant product produced by United<br>
Desiccants was compared with the products of Examples 1 and<br>
2 using the same procedures as were used in Example 1. The<br>
water absorption capability of this product over time is<br>
also shown in Table 1.<br>
In addition, the capacity of a 1/4 ratio modified<br>
starch/calcium chloride product of Example 2 was compared<br>
with the conventional 500 gram CONTAINER DRI® product. The<br>
capacity at 40 percent relative humidity, moisture uptake at<br>
40 percent relative humidity, capacity at 80 percent<br>
relative humidity and moisture uptake at 80 percent relative<br>
humidity after two months are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
As is clear from these examples, greater water<br>
absorption is shown for a composition of corn starch and<br>
calcium chloride in comparison with the conventional<br>
desiccant material. This water absorption capability is at<br>
least as good as conventional desiccant packages<br>
conventionally sold. In addition, the desiccating<br>
composition of Example 2 was compared with the CONTAINER<br>
DRI® product after 265 hours. Because of the capability of<br>
the starch to absorb the water and the liquid calcium<br>
chloride on the surface of the calcium chloride product,<br>
water did not leak from the container even after three<br>
months.<br>
Example 4<br>
100 g of calcium chloride was mixed with 25 g of<br>
modified starch (Mirasperse 629, manufactured by Staley Food<br>
Ingredients) and placed in a bag manufactured according to<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,743,942. The absorption capacity measured<br>
at 25oC., 80 percent relative humidity (r.h.) after 14 days<br>
was 23 0 percent by weight. The bag did not show any signs<br>
of leakage through the microporous films or seals, and the<br>
bag contained a firm gel (viscosity 33 Pas at 5 rpm, 15 Pas<br>
at 50 rpm).<br>
Example 5<br>
100 g of magnesium chloride was mixed with 25 g of<br>
modified starch (Mirasperse 629, manufactured by Staley Food<br>
Ingredients) and placed in a bag manufactured according to<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,743,942. The absorption capacity measured<br>
at 25°C, 80 percent r.h. after 14 days was 305 percent by<br>
weight. The bag did not show any signs of leakage through<br>
the microporous films or seals, and the bag contained a firm<br>
gel (viscosity 60 Pas at 5 rpm, 23 Pas at 50 rpm).<br>
Example 6<br>
-100 g of magnesium chloride was mixed with 20 g of<br>
modified starch (Mirasperse 629, manufactured by Staley Food<br>
Ingredients) and placed in a bag manufactured according to<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,743,942. The absorption capacity measured<br>
at 25°C, 80 percent r.h. after 14 days was 307 percent by<br>
weight. The bag did not show any signs of leakage through<br>
the microporous films or seals, and the bag contained a firm<br>
gel (viscosity 32 Pas at 5 rpm, 21 Pas at 50 rpm).<br>
As is clear from Examples 4 through 6, greater water<br>
absorption occurs with a composition of a modified starch<br>
blended with magnesium chloride than the same modified<br>
starch blended with calcium chloride. This increased<br>
absorption capacity per weight can find great utility when<br>
high moisture absorption capacities are required.<br>
Example 7<br>
100 g of CaCl2, ZnCl2, LiCl, (NH,)2CO3, NH4Cl and NaHSO4<br>
were individually mixed with 25 g of modified starch<br>
(Mirasperse 629, manufactured by Staley Food Ingredients)<br>
and placed in a bag manufactured according to U.S.<br>
5,743,942. The absorption capacity was measured at 25oC,<br>
80% r.h., 25°C, 20% r.h. and 25°C and 90% r.h. after 48<br>
hours.<br>
The following table summarizes the experimental<br>
results:<br><br>
All except one bag did not show any signs of leakage<br>
through the microporous films or seals, and the bags<br>
contained firm gels (viscosity &gt;25 Pas at 5 rpm, &gt;15 Pas at<br>
50 rpm) . The mixture with NaHSO4 did not form a gel, due to<br>
the chemical breakdown of the starch used.<br>
The table clearly shows that a combination of ZnCl2 or<br>
LiCl with starch is preferable if high capacity is needed at<br>
low relative humidity levels.<br>
If low absorption under humidity conditions less than<br>
about 80% r.h. is required, mixtures of starch with NH4C1 and<br>
(NH4)2CO3 are preferred, as they do not start to absorb<br>
significant amounts of moisture at less than 80% r.h. but<br>
show considerable absorption at higher humidity levels near<br>
the dew point.<br>
