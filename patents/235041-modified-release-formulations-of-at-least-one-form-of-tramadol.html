RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional No. 60/357,851, filed on<br>
February 21, 2002 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to modified release formulations for oral<br>
administration, to processes for their preparation and to their medical use. In<br>
particular, the present invention relates to modified release formulations of at<br>
least one form of tramadol, selected from the group consisting of tramadol,<br>
racemic mixtures thereof, enantiomers thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof and combinations thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tramadol, which was first described in United States Patent No. 3,652,589,<br>
is a class of analgesic cycloalkanol-substituted phenol esters having a basic amine<br>
group in the cycloalkyl ring and having the chemical name trans-(±)-2-<br>
[(dimethylamino)methyl]-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol.          lramao<br>
believed to produce an analgesic effect through a mechanism that is neither fully<br>
opioid-like nor non-opioid-like because clinical data suggests that tramadol lacks<br>
many of the typical side effects of opioid antagonists such as respiratory<br>
depression, constipation, tolerance and abuse liability but can produce hot<br>
flashes and sweating. Due to the combination of non-opioid and opioid activity,<br>
tramadol is a very unique analgesic and many attempts have been made to<br>
prepare oral formulations of the drug.<br>
Conventional or immediate release preparations in the form of tablets,<br>
capsules, drops and suppositories containing tramadol, or more particularly its<br>
hydrochloride salt, have been commercially available for many years for use in<br>
the treatment of moderate to severe pain. The clinical efficacy of immediate<br>
release tramadol preparations has been well established in numerous single dose<br>
and multiple dose studies, with 70% to 90% of patients obtaining satisfactory<br>
pain relief depending on the etiology of the pain. Immediate release tramadol<br>
preparations have demonstrated efficacy in obstetrical, gynecologic, orthopedic,<br>
abdominal and oral surgery. Immediate release tramadol preparations have also<br>
been studied in long-term clinical trials in patients with chronic pain of varying<br>
etiology, including low-back pain, osteoarthritis, cancer pain, neuropathic pain<br>
and orthopedic pain.<br>
Immediate release tramadol preparations, however, do not provide a<br>
controlled release of the tramadol. For example, an immediate release oral<br>
formulation of tramadol is commercially available in the United States, from<br>
McNeil Pharmaceuticals under the tradename ULTRAM® as tramadol<br>
hydrochloride tablets. The 53rd Edition of the Physician's Desk Reference,<br>
copyright 1999, p. 2255, states that peak plasma levels of tramadol for the<br>
ULTRAM® product occur at about 1.6 hours after a single oral dose (100 mg) and<br>
at about 2.3 hours after multiple oral dosing (100 mg q.i.d). The short elimination<br>
half-life of tramadol necessitates dosing of patients with immediate release<br>
tramadol preparations every 4-6 hours in order to maintain optimal levels of<br>
analgesia in chronic pain.<br>
To overcome the difficulties associated with the required dosing<br>
frequency of immediate release tramadol preparations, various attempts have<br>
been made to formulate tramadol into modified release formulations. For<br>
example, see United States Patent Nos. 5,395,626, 5,474,786, 5,645,858, 5,478,577,<br>
5,591,452, 6,254,S87, 5,601,842, 5,580,578, 5,639,476, 5,811,126, 5,849,240, 5,891,471,<br>
5,965,163, 5,958,452, 5,965,161, 5,478,577, 5,580,578, 5,648,096, 5,672,360, 5,811,126,<br>
5,879,705, 5,968,551, 5,980,941, 6,068,858, 6,077,532, 6,077,533 and 6,254,887. Such<br>
. modified release tramadol preparations purport to control the rate of release of<br>
I tramadol within the gastrointestinal tract, with the purported result that<br>
tramadol is delivered at a specific, predetermined rate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

in the relevant literature, for example in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives:<br>
An International Guide to More Tlwn 6000 Products by Trade Name, Chemical,<br>
Function, and Manufacturer; Michael and Irene Ash (Eds.); Gower Publishing Ltd.;<br>
Aldershot, Hampshire, England, 1995.<br>
The relative amounts of ingredients in the core are preferably as follows.<br>
The proportion of the at least one form of tramadol in the core may vary between<br>
about 70% and about 98% of the core dry weight. The proportion of the at least<br>
one lubricant in the core may vary between about 0.5% and about 10% of the core<br>
dry weight. The proportion of the at least one binder or at least one filler in the<br>

The manufacturing process of the core can be as follows. The at least one<br>
form of tramadol is first granulated with the at least one binder, in one<br>
embodiment a granulator, but not necessarily a fluidized bed granulator. The at<br>
least one binder is first dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent, in one<br>
embodiment water. The solution or suspension of the at least one binder is then<br>
sprayed onto the at least one form of tramadol in a granulator, in one<br>
embodiment a fluidized bed granulator. For example, fluidized bed granulators<br>
manufactured by Glatt (Germany) or Aeromatic (Switzerknd) can be used for<br>
this operation. An alternative process can be to use a conventional or high shear<br>
mixer to proceed granulation. If necessary, the at least one form of tramadol can<br>
be mixed with a filler, prior to the granulation step. Granules once dried can be<br>
mixed with the other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, especially with the<br>
at least one lubricant, but also with at least one glidant and any other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient suitable to improve processing. The<br>
mixture of granules (in one embodiment with the at least one lubricant), and<br>
optionally at least one glidant is pressed into tablets. Alternatively, the at least<br>
one form of tramadol and the at least one lubricant can be mixed in a granulator,<br>
in one embodiment a fluidized bed granulator, and heated to the melting point of<br>
the at least one lubricant to form granules. This mixture can then be mixed with<br>
at least one suitable filler and compressed into tablets. Also, it is possible to mix<br>
the at least one form of tramadol and the at least one lubricant (in one<br>
embodiment polyvinyl alcohol) in a granulator, in one embodiment a fluidized<br>
bed granulator, and then to press the resulting granules into tablets. Tablets can<br>
be obtained by standard techniques, in one embodiment on a (rotary) press (for<br>
example Manesty Betapress®) fitted with suitable punches. The resulting tablets<br>
are hereinafter referred as tablet cores.<br>
These tablet cores are then coated with the semi-permeable coating<br>
designed to achieve a controlled release of the at least one form of tramadol.<br>
The coating comprises at least one water-insoluble, water-permeable film-<br>
forming polymer, together with at least one plasticizer and at least one water-<br>
soluble polymer.<br>
The at least one water-insoluble, water-permeable film-forming polymer<br>
used in the present invention, may be any water-insoluble, water-permeable<br>
film-forming polymer conventional in the pharmaceutical art. The at least one<br>
water-insoluble, water-permeable film-forming polymer used in the present<br>
invention may be a cellulose ether, such as ethylcellulose, a cellulose ester, such<br>
as cellulose acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, etc. In one embodiment, the at least one<br>
water-insoluble, water-permeable film-forming polymer is ethylcellulose. The<br>
ethylcellulose may suitably be, for example, ETHOCEL® as supplied by Dow<br>
Chemical Company. Similar ethylcelluloses are also available from other<br>
suppliers. Preferably, the ethylcellulose used is ETHOCEL® PR, more preferably<br>
ETHOCEL® PR100.<br>
The at least one plasticizer used in the present invention, may be any<br>
plasticizer conventional in the pharmaceutical art. The at least one plasticizer<br>
used in the present invention may be an ester such as a citrate ester, an oil such<br>
as castor oil, a polyalkylene glycol of various molecular weights, such as<br>
polyethylene glycol. In one embodiment, the at least one plasticizer is dibutyl<br>
sebacate.<br>
The at least one water-soluble polymer used in the present invention, may<br>
be any water-soluble polymer conventional in the pharmaceutical art. In one<br>
embodiment, the at least one water-soluble is polyvinylpyrrolidone. The<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone may suitably be, for example, KOLLIDON® as supplied by<br>
BASF AG. Similar polyvinylpyrrolidones are also available from other suppliers.<br>
Preferably, the polyvinylpyrrolidone used is KOLLIDON® 90F.<br>
Other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can be used in the coating,<br>
such as for example, acrylic acid derivatives (available from Rohm Pharma under<br>
the trade name EUDRAGIT®), pigments, etc.<br>
The relative amounts of ingredients in the coating are preferably as<br>
follows. The proportion of the at least one water-insoluble, water-permeable<br>
polymer (in one embodiment ethylcellulose) in the coating may vary between<br>
about 20% and about 90% of the coating dry weight. The proportion of the at<br>
least one water-soluble polymer (in one embodiment polyvinylpyrrolidone) in<br>
the coating may vary between about 10% and about 75% of the coating dry<br>
weight. The proportion of the at least one plasticizer (in one embodiment dibutyl<br>
seibacate) in the coating may vary between about 5% and about 30% of the<br>
coating dry weight. The relative proportions of ingredients, notably the ratio of<br>
the at least one water-insoluble, water-permeable film-forming polymer to the at<br>
least one water-soluble polymer, can be varied depending on the desired release<br>
profile (where a more delayed release is desired, it is generally obtained with a<br>
higher amount of the at least one water-insoluble, water-permeable film-forming<br>
polymer).<br>
The coating process can be as follows. Ethylcellulose, dibutyl sebacate<br>
and polyvinylpyrrolidone are dissolved in a solvent such as denatured alcohol<br>
using a propeller stirrer until complete dissolution is achieved. The resulting<br>
solution is sprayed onto the tablet cores, using a perforated coating pan.<br>
The weight ratio coating/tablet core is comprised e.g. between about 1/30<br>
and about 3/10, preferably about 1/10.<br>
The tablet comprises an amount of the at least one form of tramadol of<br>
from about 25 mg to about 800 mg or more per tablet.<br>
The present invention thus provides a controlled release pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising at least one form of tramadol selected from the group<br>
consisting of tramadol, enantiomers thereof, pharmaceuticailly acceptable salts<br>
thereof and combinations thereof, the composition exhibiting a dissolution<br>
profile such that after 2 hours, from about 0% up to about 30% (by weight) of the<br>
at least one form of tramadol is released, after 4 hours, from about 5% to about<br>
22% (by weight) of the at least one form of tramadol is released, after 6 hours,<br>
from about 15% to about 38% (by weight) of the at least one form of tramadol is<br>
released, after 8 hours, more than about 40% (by weight) of the at least one form<br>
of tramadol is released.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the controlled release<br>
pharmaceutical composition is an extended release tablet, the tablet comprising:<br>
(i) a core comprising tramadol hydrochloride, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium stearyl fumarate; and<br>
(ii) a coating comprising ethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and<br>
dibutyl sebacate.<br>

sampling for drug content analysis was carried out at 0.0 (pre-drug), 1.0, 2.0, 3.0,<br>
4.0, 6.0, 8.0,10.0, 12.0,16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 30.0, 36.0, and 48.0 hours post-drug when<br>
each test drug was administered. Blood sampling for drug content analysis was<br>
carried out at 0.0 (pre-drug), 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 (pre-drug), 6,0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0,10.0,<br>
11.0 (pre-drug), 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0 (pre-drug), 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, 20.0, 24.0, 30.0,<br>
36.0, and 48.0 hours post-drug when the reference drug was administered.<br>
The three 100 mg extended release tramadol formulations tested (2x100<br>
once a day) demonstrated prolonged tramadol and mono-O-desmethyltramadol<br>
plasma concentration-time profiles relative to the Ultram® tablet (1 x 50mg) when<br>
administered 4 times a day (2nd, 3rd and 4th doses at 5,11 and 15 hours post-lst<br>
dose, respectively) (See figures 2 and 3). In addition, the ER formulations yielded<br>
equivalent AUCs relative to an equivalent dose of the Ultram® immediate<br>
release tablet. The 90% geometric mean confidence intervals for AUG and AUG*,<br>
were within the 80%-125% range for all three test formulations. Formulations<br>
2162 and 2165 also yielded equivalent Gmax values versus Ultram® as evidenced<br>
by 90% geometric confidence intervals within the 80-125% range. The mean<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters and 90% confidence interval for ratio of the<br>
geometric mean AUC and Cmax are presented in Tables 3a and 3b for tramadol<br>
and in Tables 4a and 4b for O-desmethyltramadol. Table 3a also shows that<br>
overall there was no apparent difference in the ratio of metabolite (AUG, of<br>
Ml/tramadol) among the ER tramadol formulations and the immediate release<br>
tablet. The half-life following Ultram® treatment was slightly shorter compared<br>
to the extended release formulations.<br>

The objective of this study was to compare the rate and extent of<br>
absorption of a new extended-release formulation of tramadol hydrochloride<br>
(2x100 mg) against Ultram® (50 mg q.i.d.) under steady-state conditions in<br>
normal healthy male and female volunteers. This comparison reflects the<br>
administration of Ultram® under clinical conditions.<br>
This pilot steady-state study was a randomized, two-way crossover study<br>
design in sixteen (16) normal, healthy, non-smoking male and female volunteers<br>
and four (4) alternates (total 11 males and 9 females).<br>
Twenty (20) subjects were entered into the study. Fifteen (15) subjects<br>
completed the study; there were fifteen (15) evaluable subjects. All subjects were<br>
non-smoking, between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive), and with body weights<br>
no more than ±15% of the ideal weight for the subject's height and frame as<br>
determined by the Table of Desirable Weights for Men and Women. All female<br>
subjects were non-lactating, had negative pregnancy tests, and were taking an<br>
acceptable method of contraception.<br>

In the current study, Lot# 2162 was compared to immediate release<br>
Ultram® under multiple-dose conditions. The extended release formulation<br>
performed consistently under both single and multiple doses. The overall half-<br>
life after multiple-dose for tramadol was 7.3 hours and 6.7 hours, respectively,<br>
following Tramadol HC1ER Tablets and Ultram®. Steady state levels of tramadol<br>
were achieved by the third dose (day 3 of the study) for Tramadol HC1 ER<br>
Tablets, and by the fifth dose (Day 2 of the study) for Ultram®. The mean<br>
pharmacokinetic data for single dose and multiple dose of tramadol and the Ml<br>
are presented in tables 5a - 5b and 6a - 6b, respectively. Steady-state<br>
bioequivalence between Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets (Lot# 2162) and immediate-<br>
release Ultram® (Lot # CDA2225) was established. The 90% confidence intervals<br>
for AUC and Cmax were within the 80-125% limits for both unchanged drug and<br>
O-desmethyltramadol. Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets (Lot# 2162) given once daily<br>
exhibited lower percent fluctuation at steady state (70%) than Ultram® given four<br>
times a day.<br>

The current study was undertaken to compare the two lead Tramadol HC1<br>
ER Tablet formulations (Lot# 2162 and Lot# 2165) (3x100 mg) administered once<br>
daily against Ultram® (2x50 mg) administered three times a day under steady-<br>
state conditions in normal healthy male and female volunteers. This comparison<br>
reflects the administration of Ultram® under clinical conditions.<br>
The extended release formulations performed consistently both under<br>
single and multiple dose conditions. The overall half-life after multiple-dose for<br>
tramadol was 7.3 hours following Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets (Lot# 2162), 6.9<br>
hours following Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets (Lot# 2165), and 6.4 hours immediate<br>
release Ultram®. Steady state levels of tramadol were achieved by the third dose<br>
(day 3 of the study) for Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets, (Lot# 2162 and Lot# 2165) and<br>
by the seventh dose (day 3 of the study) for Ultram®. The mean pharmacokinetic<br>
data for single dose and multiple doses of tramadol and the Ml are presented in<br>
tables 7a - 7b and 8a - 8b, respectively. Steady-state bioequivalence between<br>
Tramadol HC1 ER tablets (Lot# 2162 and Lot# 2165) and immediate-release<br>

This study was designed to determine the dosage strength proportionality of<br>
two strengths of Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets (2 x 100 mg vs 1 x 200 mg) under single<br>
dose fasting conditions.<br>
7.3: Study Design<br>
A single-dose, open-label, two-way, two-sequence, crossover design. The<br>
treatments were separated by a one (1) week washout period. On day 1 of each<br>
period, subjects received one of the following treatments on two (2) separate<br>
occasions according to the randomization scheme<br>
Treatment A:           Two Tramadol HC1 Extended Release 100 mg Tablets with 240<br>
mL of water at 0.0 hour following a 10 hour overnight fast<br>
(Total Daily Dose = 200 mg)<br>
Treatment B:             One Tramadol HCl Extended Release 200 mg Tablet with 240<br>
mL of water at 0.0 hour following a 10 hour overnight fast<br>
(Total Daily Dose 200 mg)<br>
7.4: Summary and Conclusions<br>
This study was intended to determine the dosage strength proportionality<br>
of two strengths of Tramadol HCl ER Tablets (2 x 100 mg vs 1 x 200 mg) under<br>
single dose fasting conditions. A total of 12 male subjects were dosed at Biovail<br>
Contract Research. Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses were conducted<br>
with preliminary plasma data from 12 completing subjects for Tramadol, and Ml<br>
metabolite. The mean plasma concentrations vs time plots based on 12<br>
completing subjects for tramadol, and Ml metabolite are presented in Figures 15<br>
and 16, respectively. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in<br>
Tables 18a, 18b, 19a and 19b.<br>
With all subjects, the ratio of geometric means (1 x 200 mg / 2 x 100 mg)<br>
for tramadol AUC0-t and Cmax were 1.11 and 1.17, respectively. The<br>
corresponding 90% confidence intervals were 97% - 125% and 103% - 133%,<br>
respectively. For the Ml metabolite, the ratio of geometric means (1 x 200 mg / 2<br>
x 100 mg) for AUC0-t and Cmax were 1.05 and 1.11, respectively. The<br>
corresponding 90% confidence intervals were 96% - 116% and 102%. - 121%,<br>
respectively.<br>
In conclusion, the 200 mg strength Tramadol HC1 ER Tablets were<br>
proportional to the 100 mg strength given as 2 x 100 mg since the 90 %<br>
confidence intervals for AUCo-t and Cmax for all analytes were found to be within<br>
80%-125.<br>

EXAMPLE 9:<br>
A two-way, crossover, open-label, single-dose, food effect, comparative<br>
biovailability study of Tramadol HC1 Extended-Release 200 mg Tablets in normal<br>
healthy non-smoking male subjects was conducted.<br>
9.1: Synopsis<br>
Based on preliminary data from 20 completing subjects, the presence of food<br>
significantly decreased the rate and extent of absorption of tramadol, Ml and M5<br>
metabolites of Tramadol HC1 ER tablets 200 mg following single dose<br>
administration.<br>
9.2: Purpose of Study<br>
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of food on Tramadol HC1 ER<br>
200 mg Tablets following single dose administration.<br>
9.3: Study Design<br>
A single-dose, open-label, two-way, two-sequence, crossover design. The<br>
treatments were separated by a one (1) week washout period. On day 1 of each<br>
period, subjects received one of the following treatments following a 10 hour<br>
overnight fast on two (2) separate occasions according to the randomization<br>
scheme<br>
Treatment A:             One Tramadol HC1 Extended Release 200 mg Tablet with 240<br>
mL of water at 0.0 hour within 5 minutes of complete<br>
ingestion of a high fat content breakfast.<br>
Treatment B:            One Tramadol HC1 Extended Release 200 mg Tablet with 240<br>
mL of water at 0.0 hour following a 10 hour overnight fast.<br>
9.4: Summary and Conclusions<br>
This study was intended to evaluate the effect of food on Tramadol HC1<br>
ER 200 mg Tablets following single dose administration. A total of 24 male<br>
subjects were dosed at Biovail Contract Research. Pharmacokinetic and<br>
statistical analyses were conducted with preliminary plasma data from 22<br>
completing subjects. The mean plasma concentrations vs time plots based on 20<br>
completing subjects for tramadol, Ml and M5 metabolites are presented in<br>
Figures 20, 21 and 22, respectively. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters are<br>
shown in Tables 23, 24 and 25.<br>
With all subjects, the ratio of geometric means (Fed / Fasting) for<br>
tramadol AUCo-t and Cmax were 0.76 and 0.73, respectively. For the Ml<br>
metabolite, the ratio of geometric means (Fed / Fasting) for AUCo-t and Cmax<br>
were 0.75 and 0.76, respectively. For the M5 metabolite, the ratio of geometric<br>
means (Fed / Fasting) for AUCo-t and Cmax were 0.73 and 0.73, respectively.<br>
When data analysis was carried out in the absence of subject #12 and #18,<br>
the ratio of geometric means for tramadol AUCo-t and Cmax were 0.79 and 0.73,<br>
respectively. For the Ml metabolite, the ratio of geometric means (Fed / Fasting)<br>
for AUCo-t and Cmax were 0.78 and 0.76, respectively. For the M5 metabolite, the<br>
ratio of geometric means (Fed / Fasting) for AUCo-t and C were 0.75 and 0.72,<br>
respectively.<br>
Based on the results, it was concluded that a significant food effect was<br>
observed for Tramadol HC1 ER 200 mg Tablets. In the presence of food, the rate<br>
and extent of absorption of tramadol and its metabolites resulting from a single<br>
dose of Tramadol HC1 ER 200 mg Tablet were significantly lower when<br>
compared to administration without food.<br>

EXAMPLE 10: Tramadol ER Osteoarthritis Study<br>
10.1: Overall Study Design and plan<br>
A 12-week, multi-center double blind, randomized, dose-titration,<br>
parallel-group comparison of the efficacy and safety of Tramadol ER tablets and<br>
placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee was conducted.<br>
Approximately 245 patients from 18 to 75 years of age with moderate to severe<br>
pain associated with Functional Class I-M osteoarthritis of the knee were<br>
planned for study enrollment to ensure that a minimum of 140 patients<br>
completed the study. After signing the iriformed consent, patients who met the<br>
inclusion and exclusion criteria at screening entered a 2 to 7 day washout period<br>
during which all analgesic use was discontinued. At the start of the first week of<br>
the study (Baseline, Visit 2), eligible patients who reported pain intensity &gt; 40<br>
mm on a visual analog scale (VAS) in the index knee joint were randomly<br>
assigned to either Tramadol ER tablets or placebo.<br>
Patients assigned to Tramadol ER tablets were initiated on 100 mg QD and<br>
maintained on their dose for at least 3 days. On Day 4, and for the remainder of<br>
the week (until their return to the clinic for Visit 3), patients were permitted to<br>
have their dose increased to 200 mg QD, based upon the tolerability of side<br>
effects. Beginning at Visit 3, patients must have been maintained on a minimum<br>
Tramadol ER tablet dose of 200 mg QD, and the dose titrated upwards if<br>
required based upon the adequacy of pain relief and tolerability of side effects.<br>
Patients randomized to the placebo group underwent sham dose increases.<br>
Further dose escalation and de-escalation was permitted provided that a<br>
minimum dose of 200 mg QD was maintained from Week 1 (Visit 3) to Week 12<br>
(Visit 7). In patients with pain unresponsive to appropriate dosage adjustments,<br>
or with unacceptable side effects, treatment was discontinued and alternate<br>
analgesia therapy initiated, as appropriate. Patients returned for efficacy and<br>
safety evaluations at Week 1 (Visit 3), Week 2 (Visit 4), Week 4 (Visit 5), Week 8<br>
(Visit 6) and Week 12 (Visit 7) or at Early Termination.<br>
10.2: Efficacy Variables<br>
The primary measure of efficacy was the Arthritis Pain Intensity VAS<br>
(visual analog scale) Score from patient visits. The arthritis VAS is the most<br>
commonly used, validated tool to assess pain intensity and one recommended by<br>
FDA to evaluate the analgesic potential of a drug product.<br>
Pain was also assessed as a secondary measure of efficacy using the<br>
WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. The WOMAC is a validated, internationally<br>
recognized and widely used multidimensional instrument for assessing response<br>
to therapy in osteoarthritis. It assesses pain, joint stiffness and physical function,<br>
the three major bothersome symptoms in osteoarthritis. In addition, patients and<br>
physicians provided a Global assessment of disease and patients recorded their<br>
response on a sleep questionnaire as other secondary measures of efficacy.<br>
10.3: Results<br>
A total of 246 patients were randomized and evaluable for safety. Of<br>
these, 219 were evaluable for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT<br>
population included all safety evaluable patients who had primary efficacy<br>
information recorded at the baseline visit (Visit 2) and at the Week 1 visit (Visit<br>
3), the first primary efficacy variable collection point on treatment. The ITT<br>
population also included all patients who dropped out before the Week 1 visit<br>
due to lack of treatment efficacy. The mean daily dose of Tramadol ER following<br>
the flexible dosing regimen was approximately 300 mg. The median age of<br>
patients who enrolled was 61 years and the median duration of osteoarthritis was<br>
10 years.<br>
Tramadol ER produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful<br>
reductions in pain intensity associated with osteoarthritis of the knee compared<br>
to placebo for the primary efficacy variable and all secondary variables<br>
evaluated.<br>
10.4: Response to Primary Variable<br>
Figure 23 compares the LS mean change from baseline in VAS score for<br>
Tramadol ER and placebo based upon the average of Weeks 1-12. On the<br>
primary endpoint (LS Mean change from baseline over 12 weeks), there was a<br>
39.5% (30.4 mm) and 21.5% (17.7 mm) change from baseline in the arthritis pain<br>
intensity VAS in the Tramadol ER and placebo groups, 'respectively (LS Mean<br>
Difference 12.7 mm, p
from baseline for the two treatment groups. Treatment differences emerged at<br>
the first return visit (Week 1) when patients were receiving either a 100 mg or 200<br>
mg dose of Tramadol ER (change from baseline 24.8% [19.6 mm] vs. 14.0% [11.1<br>
mm], LS mean difference 8.5 mm, p=0.003). At the end of the second week of<br>
treatment, the response to Tramadol ER increased relative to placebo (change<br>
from baseline 35.7% [27.4 mm] vs. 19.3% [15.7 mm], LS mean difference 11.7 mm,<br>
p
baseline) was 48.6% [37.4 mm] while that for placebo was 27.0% [22.1 mm]. The<br>
LS Mean difference was 15.3 mm, p
10.5: Response on the Secondary Variables<br>
Figure 25 compares the LS mean changes from baseline to Week 12 for the<br>
Tramadol ER and placebo for each of the secondary variables.<br>
10.5.1: WQMACSubscales<br>
Results on the three dimensions of the WOMAC, namely pain, stiffness<br>
and physical function were similar to the main findings. Tramadol ER tablets<br>
was significantly better than placebo in improving pain, stiffness and physical<br>
function on the WOMAC.<br>
At Week 12, on the WOMAC Pain Subscale, Tramadol ER was<br>
significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 44.6% [155.9 mm] vs.<br>
24.8% [86.9 mm], LS mean difference on 0-100 mm Scale 13.8 mm, p
At Week 12, on the WOMAC Stiffness Subscale, Tramadol ER was<br>
significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 43.4% [63.9 mm] vs.<br>
18.1% [33.8 mm], LS mean difference on 0-100 mm Scale 15.0 mm, p
At Week 12, on the WOMAC Physical Function Subscale, Tramadol ER<br>
was significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 43.8% [518.3 mm]<br>
vs. 21.3% [270.4 mm], LS mean difference on 0-100 mm Scale 14.6 mm, p
At Week 12, on the WOMAC Composite Score, Tramadol ER was<br>
significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 42.2% [737.9 mm] vs.<br>
22.8% [391.2 mm], LS mean difference on 0-100 mm Scale 14.4 mm, p
3.5.2: WOMAC Pain Walking on a Flat Surface<br>
In the past, some studies have utilized one item from the WOMAC pain<br>
subscale as the primary endpoint. Since some of the questions on the WOMAC<br>
subscale relate to walking "up" or "down stairs" (and some areas of the country<br>
preferred by the elderly have few stairs, e.g., Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, etc),<br>
the WOMAC pain subscale question, "Pain Walking on a Rat Surface" is<br>
preferred by some biometricians.<br>
At Week 12, on the WOMAC Pain Walking on Flat Surface, Tramadol ER<br>
was significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 40.9% [29.9 mm]<br>
vs. 15.7% [15.9 mm], LS Mean Difference 14 mm, p
Figure 25.<br>
10.5.3: Patient Global Assessment of Osteoarthritis<br>
At Week 12, on the Patient Global Assessment of Arthritis, Tramadol ER<br>
was significantly different from placebo (change from baseline 33.0% [33.2 mm]<br>
vs. 24.4% [18.5 mm], LS Mean Difference 14.7 mm, p
10.6: Safety Results<br>
This was a placebo-controlled study without a positive control.<br>
Consequently, direct comparison with data on ULTRAM® product are not<br>
possible. However, indirect comparisons with the ULTRAM® product package<br>
insert are possible. Table 1 provides data on the cumulative incidence of adverse<br>
events on ULTRAM® in chronic non-malignant pain. The 90-day comparison is<br>
the most appropriate, given the 12 weeks duration of the present study. Adverse<br>
events were qualitatively similar. However, the incidence of the most commonly<br>
observed adverse events were generally lower for Tramadol ER after up to 90<br>
days compared to only 7 days of treatment with ULTRAM®.<br>
10.7: Conclusion:<br>
Tramadol ER produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful<br>
reductions in pain associated with osteoarthritis compared to placebo following a<br>
flexible dosing regimen in which the once-daily tablet formulation was titrated<br>
upward or downward over 12 weeks in doses of 200mg, 300mg or 400mg based<br>
upon adequacy of pain relief and tolerability of side effects. The mean daily dose<br>
of Tramadol ER was estimated to be about 300mg. The primary efficacy variable<br>
was pain relief as measured on a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary measures<br>
of efficacy were the pain intensity, stiffness and physical function subscales of<br>
WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the Patient's and Physician's Global Assessment<br>
of Arthritis, patient withdrawal due to inadequate pain relief, and patient<br>
assessment of sleep.<br>
At the end of the first week of treatment and at all subsequent weeks,<br>
Tramadol ER was statistically superior to placebo in reducing pain. The<br>
magnitude pain improvement (change from baseline) for the Tramadol ER cohort<br>
increased weekly throughout the 12 weeks of therapy (25% at Week 1 and 47% at<br>
Week 12). By Week 12, patient's treated with Tramadol reported a clinically<br>
important 15 mm difference in mean pain relief score compared to placebo. This<br>
difference was highly significant (p
through 12, the Tramadol ER treated patients achieved a highly statistically<br>
significant and clinically meaningful 14 mm difference in mean pain relief score<br>
compared to placebo (p 
paralleled those of the primary with all results statistically significant in favor or<br>
Tramadol ER.<br>
The adverse events reported were qualitatively similar to that for Ultram.<br>
However, the incidence was generally lower for Tramadol ER than for that<br>
previously reported for ULTRAM®.<br>
The results of this 12 week placebo controlled study demonstrate that<br>
Tramadol ER, when given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg QD, results in significant<br>
improvements in the cardinal symptoms of osteoarthritis, namely pain, stiffness<br>
and physical function. The safety profile of Tramadol ER is consistent with that<br>
for ULTRAM®, although the frequency of some adverse events appears to be<br>
lower than historical controls.<br>
10.8: Clinical Implications<br>
In the present study, using conventional endpoints for evaluating efficacy,<br>
Tramadol ER demonstrated a 30.4 mm and 37.4 mm change from baseline in<br>
Arthritis Pain Intensity VAS, when expressed as a mean over 12 weeks (primary<br>
endpoint) and at the 12-Week time point, respectively. However, consistent with<br>
most such studies, the placebo treatment demonstrates a 17.7 mm and 22.1 mm<br>
change from baseline in Arthritis Pain Intensity VAS, when expressed as a mean<br>
over 12 weeks (primary endpoint) and at the 12-Week time point, respectively.<br>
Consequently, the actual treatment difference (response on Tramadol ER less<br>
response on placebo) is a 12.7 mm and 15.3 mm change from baseline in Arthritis<br>
Pain Intensity VAS, when expressed as a mean over 12 weeks (primary endpoint)<br>
and at the 12-Week time point, respectively.<br>
A close examination of the time course and magnitude of the<br>
pharmacological response (on the primary and secondary variables) following<br>
treatment with Tramadol ER indicates that this is a clear drug effect: the<br>
magnitude of the response increases over time and all of the effects (pain,<br>
stiffness, physical function, patient global) are directionally consistent and<br>
generally of comparable size.<br>
There are two available benchmarks for determining the robustness of the<br>
analgesic response to Tramadol ER in osteoarthritis. One approach involves<br>
using the perspectives from the academic rheumatology co:cnmunity. The other<br>
involves using the results of pivotal studies in osteoarthritis from recently<br>
approved and commercially successful drugs.<br>
In a consensus development (3-round Delphi exercise) involving academic<br>
rheumatologists, a 15 mm treatment difference in patients overall assessment of<br>
pain was considered to be the minimum clinically important difference (MCID)<br>
for clinical trial purposes (Bellamy N, Carette S, Ford PM et al. Osteoarthritis<br>
Antirheumatic Drug Trials. II. Tables for calculating sample size for clinical<br>
trials. J Rheumatol 1992;19:444-50; Bellamy N, Carette S, Ford PM et al.<br>
Osteoarthritis Antirheumatic Drug Trials. III. Delta for Clinical Trials - Results<br>
of a Consensus Development (Delphi) Exercise. J Rheumatology 1992; 19:3, 451-<br>
457). However, in a recently published study, the minimum clinically<br>
perceptible improvement (MCPI) on the three dimensions of WOMAC pain,<br>
stiffness and physical function subscale scores (expressed using a 0-100 mm<br>
scale) were 9.7, 9.3 and 10 mm, respectively (Beaton DE, Bombardier C, Katz J et<br>
al. Looking for important change/difference in studies of responsiveness. J<br>
Rheumatol 2001;28;400-405.).<br>
Data from other approved analgesics for which the NDA contained<br>
pivotal clinical trials in osteoarthritis were obtained under from the FDA under<br>
Freedom of Information (FOI). Although a direct comparison with other drugs is<br>
not possible and no drugs exist in the Tramadol class (combined serotonergic,<br>
noardrenergic and opioidergic effects), data on other analgesics provide a context<br>
for the results of the Tramadol ER study.<br>
Rofecoxib (VIOXX®) is approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis at a<br>
daily dose of 12.5 mg; with the comment that some patients may derive a benefit<br>
from an increase in does to 25 mg per day (maximum dose). The efficacy studies<br>
with rofecoxib in osteoarthritis were 6 weeks in duration. The WOMAC variable<br>
"pain walking on a flat surface" was used as the primary endpoint. In most<br>
cases, the LS mean change from baseline over 6-weeks formed the basis of<br>
comparison. The mean difference between rofecoxib 12.5 mg and placebo was<br>
14.3 mm (Study No. 029), 12.4 mm (Study No. 033), 15.4 mm (Study No. 040) and<br>
9.0 (Study No. 058). Similarly, the mean difference between the positive control<br>
and placebo was 13.5 mm (Ibuprofen, 2400 mg, Study No. 033), 14.6 mm<br>
(Ibuprofen, 2400 mg, Study No. 040) and 10 mm (Nabumetone [Relafen®], 1500<br>
mg, Study No. 058).<br>
Celecoxib (CELEBREX®) is approved for the treatment of osteoarthritis at<br>
a daily dose of 200 mg. Pivotal clinical trials were placebo controlled studies of<br>
either 6 or 12 weeks duration and used naproxen as the positive control. Study<br>
No. 020 and 054 served as pivotal clinical trials and Studies 040 and 087 were<br>
placebo controlled evaluations of celecoxib 100 mg BID vs. 200 mg QD. There<br>
were multiple primary endpoints in each of the studies, including Patients<br>
Assessment of Arthritis Pain VAS. The LS mean difference in pain VAS change<br>
from baseline between celecoxib 100 mg BID and placebo was 8.0 mm (12 weeks;<br>
Study No. 020), 12.2 mm (12 weeks; Study No. 054), 13.9 mm (6 weeks; Celecoxib<br>
100 mg BID; Study No. 040) and 13.1 mm (6 weeks; Celecoxib 200 mg QD; Study<br>
No. 040), 6.2 mm (6 weeks; Celecoxib 100 mg BID; Study No. 087) and 8.5 mm (6<br>
weeks; Celecoxib 100 mg BID; Study No. 087). Similarly, the mean difference<br>
between the positive control and placebo was 7.6 mm (Naproxen 500 mg BID,<br>
Study No. 020) and 11.2 mm (Naproxen 500 mg BID, Study No. 054).<br>
The results of the present study demonstrate that Tramadol ER at an<br>
approximate dose of 300 mg QD (range 200 to 400 mg) provides a robust<br>
analgesic response in OA. The magnitude of the response is at least equal, if not<br>
superior to that of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. With its advantage of once<br>
daily dosing, Tramadol ER will be an important addition to the therapeutic<br>
armamentarium of clinicians treating chronic pain.<br>
EXAMPLE 11:<br>
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison of the<br>
efficacy and safety of 200 mg and 300 mg Tramadol HC1 Extended-Release<br>
Tablets to placebo in the treatment of chronic low<br>
back pain was conducted.<br>
11.1: Study Overview<br>
A multicenter, multiple-dose, randomized, placebo-controlled,<br>
parallel-group study involving a minimum of 360 patients designed to compare<br>
the analgesic efficacy and safety of extended release tramadol (Tramadol ER)<br>
300 mg and 200 mg orally (PO) once-daily (QD) to placebo in patients with<br>
chronic low back pain.<br>
11.2: Subjects<br>
Patients with chronic (&gt; 6 months) low back pain requiring daily treatment<br>
with an analgesic.<br>
11.3: Design<br>
An open-label run-in period followed by a double-blind, randomized,<br>
multiple-dose, placebo-controlled study. Patients may roll-over into an ongoing<br>
1-year open-label extension study.<br>
11.4: Treatment Regimen:<br>
A 3-week, open-label run-in period, including 2 weeks of dose titration on<br>
Tramadol ER, beginning with 100 mg, to attain a tolerable dose of 300 mg QD,<br>
followed by 1 week on a stable maintenance dose of Tramadol ER 300 mg QD.<br>
Following the run-in period, patients were randomized to one of the following<br>
double-blind treatments:<br>
Tramadol ER 300 mg QD at 8:00 A.M.;<br>
Tramadol ER 200 mg QD at 8:00 A.M.;<br>
Placebo QD at 8:00 A.M.<br>
11.5: Enrollment Period<br>
5 months<br>
11.6: Treatment Period<br>
At Screening (Visit 1), eligible patients underwent laboratory testing, and<br>
then entered a 2 to 7 day washout period during which all analgesic use was<br>
discontinued. At Visit 2 (Week -3), eligible patients who reported a pain<br>
intensity of &gt;40 mm on a visual analog scale entered a 3-week, open-label run-in<br>
period. Patients were initiated on Tramadol ER 100 mg QD and maintained at<br>
their dose for at least 3 days. On Day 4, and for the remainder of the week (until<br>
their return to the clinic for Visit 3, Week -2), patients had their dose increased to<br>
200 mg QD, based on the tolerability of side effects. Beginning at Visit 3 (Week -<br>
2), patients were maintained on a minimum Tramadol ER dose of 200 mg QD,<br>
and the dose titrated upwards (i.e. to 300 mg QD) based on the tolerability of side<br>
effects. Beginning at Visit 4 (Week -1), patients escalated their Tramadol ER dose<br>
to 300 mg QD and maintained that dose for 1 week. No further dose adjustments<br>
were permitted during the remainder of the run-in period. In patients with pain<br>
unresponsive to appropriate dosage adjustments, or with unacceptable side<br>
effects, treatment was discontinued and alternate analgesic therapy initiated, as<br>
appropriate. Eligible patients receiving Tramadol ER 300 mg QD at the end of<br>
the 3-week run-in period were entered into a 12-week, double-blind, randomized<br>
study. At Visit 5 (WeekO), patients were randomly assigned to receive<br>
Tramadol ER 300 mg QD, Tramadol ER 200 mg QD, or placebo QD. Study<br>
medication dosing occurred daily at 8:00 A.M. No dose adjustments were<br>
permitted in the double-blind period. Patients unable to tolerate the<br>
double-blind study medication and those with unacceptable pain control were<br>
dropped from the study. Patients returned for efficacy and safety evaluations at<br>
Week 1 (Visit 6), Week 2 (Visit 7), Week 4 (Visit 8), Week 8 (Visit 9), and Week 12<br>
(Visit 10), or Early Termination. Study medication was discontinued at Visit 10<br>
and patients were treated with nonopioid analgesics until they returned to the<br>
clinic after 1 week for a post-study medication visit (Visit 11, Week 13). Patients<br>
were contacted by telephone between Visit 10 and Visit 11 to ensure that they<br>
were not taking opioid analgesics, including tramadol. Visit 11 was scheduled<br>
earlier than 1 week after Visit 10, in the event that patient pain could not be<br>
managed with nonopioid analgesics, and intervention with opioid analgesics or<br>
tramadol was necessary. At Visit 11, patients completed assessments for physical<br>
dependence and adverse events.<br>
11.7: No. of Centers<br>
30 centers<br>
11.8: No. of Subjects<br>
Approximately 600 patients were enrolled to provide a minimum of<br>
360 patients (120 patients per treatment).<br>
11.9: Efficacy<br>
At each visit, patients were asked to rate their current pain intensity and<br>
their pain intensity since their previous visit, using a visual analog scale (VAS),<br>
and they provided an overall global assessment of study medication. The<br>
primary efficacy measure was the patient's pain intensity VAS score since the<br>
previous visit. Secondary measures included the patient's current pain intensity,<br>
the patient's global assessment, the Roland Disability Index, the patient's<br>
assessment of sleep and premature study termination due to inefficacy.<br>
11.10: Safety<br>
Safety was assessed at each visit by vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate,<br>
supine or sitting and standing blood pressure) and a non-directed adverse events<br>
questionnaire. At Screening and at each visit, including Early Termination,<br>
patients were evaluated for the occurrence of syncope, orthostasis, dizziness,<br>
drop attacks and flushing (vasodilation). Adverse events were monitored<br>
throughout the study. Physical examination was performed at Screening (Visit 1)<br>
and at the Final Visit (Visit 11), or at Early Termination. Clinical laboratory<br>
testing was performed at Screening (Visit 1), at Week-3 (Visit 2), at Baseline<br>
(WeekO, Visit 5), at Weekl (Visit 6), and at Week 12 (Visit 10) or Early<br>
Termination. In females of childbearing potential, serum pregnancy tests were<br>
performed at Screening (Visit 1), at Week -3 (Visit 2), at Baseline (Week 0, Visit 5),<br>
at Weekl (Visit6), at Week4 (Visit8), at Week8 (Visit9), and at Week 12<br>
(Visit 10) or Early Termination. If the Screening (Visit 1) serum pregnancy results<br>
were not available from the central laboratory at the start of the run-in period<br>
(Visit 2), then the site obtained a urine pregnancy test locally. EKGs were<br>
performed at Screening (Visit 1), at Baseline (WeekO, Visit 5) and at Week 12<br>
(Visit 10) or at Early Termination. The Addiction Research Center Inventory<br>
(ARCI) Short-form was completed by patients at each visit following the<br>
Screening Visit. The Physical Dependence Questionnaire was completed by<br>
patients at the start of the run-in period (Visit 2), at Week 12 (Visit 10), and at<br>
Week 13 (Visit 11) or at Early Termination.<br>
