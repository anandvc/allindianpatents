DESCRIPTION<br>
HEAT-SETTING INK COMPOSITION FOR OFFSET PRINTING PROCESS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an ink composition for<br>
heatset offset printing having an excellent drying property,<br>
and further relates to an ink composition for heatset offset<br>
printing which is capable of being dried at a temperature lower<br>
than that for the conventional ink, does not cause skinning<br>
during storage, and does not lower printability.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
A conventionally used ink composition for heatset offset<br>
printing is comprised of a coloring agent, a binder resin, a<br>
vegetable oil such as a drying oil, a low-boiling petroleum<br>
solvent and the like. Ink of this type is used in a form of<br>
printing in which the ink is heated after printing and dried<br>
by evaporating the low-boiling petroleum solvent in the ink<br>
(heatset web offset printing). The drying system in heatset<br>
web offset printing has established a printing system having<br>
an extremely high productivity, normally by heating a paper face<br>
using a drying device (there exist methods such as a hot-air<br>
blowing type, a direct-heat burner type, a combination of these<br>
types, and the like) adjacent to a printing machine until the<br>
paper-face temperature becomes 100°C or higher, forcibly<br>
evaporating the low-boiling petroleum solvent, and fixing the<br>
binder resin, the coloring agent and the like onto the print<br>
media (generally, paper).<br>
[0003]<br>
However, raising the paper-face temperature to 100°C or<br>
higher as described above causes problems such as wrinkles being<br>
generated on paper and high energy costs being required; to<br><br>
2<br>
prevent these problems, there is a demand for printing at a<br>
paper-face drying temperature as low as possible. Further, in<br>
recent years, printing speed has been increased in order to<br>
improve printing efficiency, whereby the time period for<br>
printed materials to pass through the drying device has been<br>
shortened. Therefore, an ink composition for heatset offset<br>
printing capable of being dried with addition of a lower heat<br>
energy is demanded to obtain excellent printed materials under<br>
such printing conditions.<br>
Conventionally, the content of a solvent having a low<br>
boiling point has been increased as a method for improving the<br>
drying property of the ink composition for heatset offset<br>
printing. However, the increased content of a solvent having<br>
a low boiling point has caused a problem such as lowering<br>
stability on press of the ink, thereby having limited<br>
improvement of the drying property.<br>
[0004]<br>
Furthermore, as a method in which a form of drying other<br>
than evaporation is used, a method is known in which a drier<br>
such as metal soaps that improve the drying property of ink by<br>
oxidative polymerization, and an antioxidant such as butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT) for preventing skinning during storage of<br>
ink are used together. However, improving the drying property<br>
of ink by using this method produces more effects from the drier<br>
than those from the antioxidant, whereby occurrence of skinning<br>
is unavoidable; then, using the antioxidant to restrain<br>
occurrence of skinning to the conventional level produces more<br>
effects from the antioxidant than those from the drier, whereby<br>
the desired drying property is not possible to be achieved in<br>
this case.<br>
[0005]<br>
Eventually, the conventionally known methods have not<br>
been capable of achieving a balance between a performance of<br>
improving the drying property and conflicting performances of<br>
maintaining stability on press and restraining skinning.<br><br>
3<br>
Therefore, obtaining the desired drying property has been<br>
difficult without lowering storage stability and printability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide an ink composition for heatset offset printing which<br>
has an excellent drying property, does not cause skinning during<br>
storage of ink composition, and has excellent stability on press<br>
in printing.<br>
[0007]<br>
As a result of intensive investigations made to<br>
accomplish the above object, the present inventors have found<br>
that the above object can be attained in the case that an ink<br>
composition for heatset offset printing contains respective<br>
predetermined amounts of a metal soap drier, a phenolic<br>
antioxidant, and at least one kind selected from the group<br>
consisting of a polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative<br>
thereof, tocopherol, and tocotrienol, thereby completing the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0008]<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
(1) an ink composition for heatset offset printing containing<br>
a pigment, a binder resin, a petroleum solvent, and at least<br>
one kind of vegetable oil component selected from the group<br>
consisting of a vegetable oil and a fatty acid ester of the<br>
vegetable oil,<br>
the content of the vegetable oil component being 20% by<br>
mass or less, and<br>
the ink composition further containing: 0.008 to 0.7% by<br>
mass of a metal soap drier based on the mass of the metal<br>
contained in the drier; 0.008 to 12% by mass of at least one<br>
kind selected from the group consisting of a polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acid, a derivative of the polyvalent carboxylic acid,<br>
tocopherol, and tocotrienol; and 0.08 to 12% by mass of a<br><br>
4<br>
phenolic antioxidant.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to<br>
(2) the ink composition for heatset offset printing<br>
described in above paragraph (1),<br>
wherein the polyvalent carboxylic acid and the derivative<br>
of the polyvalent carboxylic acid are at least one kind selected<br>
from the group consisting of: citric acid; ascorbic acid;<br>
succinic acid; adipic acid; and derivatives of citric acid,<br>
ascorbic acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid.<br>
Hereinafter, the detailed description of the present<br>
invention will be given.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]<br>
The ink composition for heatset offset printing of the<br>
present invention is used in a printing method having a form<br>
of drying in which a solvent is evaporated by heating after<br>
printing; moreover, the ink composition for heatset offset<br>
printing of the present invention contains respective<br>
predetermined amounts of a metal soap drier, a phenolic<br>
antioxidant, and at least one kind selected from the group<br>
consisting of a polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative of the<br>
polyvalent carboxylic acid, tocopherol, and tocotrienol, and<br>
further contains 20% by mass or less of a vegetable oil component<br>
in the ink composition.<br>
Hereinafter, the constituent materials of the ink<br>
composition for heatset offset printing of the present<br>
invention (it should be noted that "ink composition for heatset<br>
offset printing" may be simply described as "ink composition<br>
for offset printing" hereinafter) are described.<br>
[0010]<br>
As the pigments contained in the ink composition for<br>
offset printing of the present invention, inorganic or organic<br>
pigments being colorless or colored, generally used for offset<br>
printing ink, can be used. Specific examples of these include:<br><br>
5<br>
inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide, barium sulfate,<br>
calcium carbonate, organic bentonite, aerosil, iron oxide, and<br>
carbon black; organic pigments such as azo pigment, lake pigment,<br>
phthalocyanine pigment, isoindoline pigment, anthraquinone<br>
pigment, and quinacridone pigment; and the like. Each of these<br>
pigments can be used alone or two or more kinds of these can<br>
be used in combination. The proper content of the pigment in<br>
the ink composition for offset printing is 5 to 50% by mass.<br>
[0011]<br>
As the binder resin contained in the ink composition for offset<br>
printing of the present invention, binder resins that are<br>
generally used for offset printing ink can be used. Specific<br>
examples of the binder resin include various kinds of phenolic<br>
resins such as a rosin modified phenolic resin and a petroleum<br>
resin modified phenolic resin, a petroleum resin, various kinds<br>
of alkyd resins, a rosin ester resin, a polyester resin, a drying<br>
oil modified resin of these compounds, and the like. Each of<br>
these compounds can be used alone or two or more kinds of these<br>
can be used in combination.<br>
The proper content of the binder resin in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is 10 to 40% by mass.<br>
[0012]<br>
A proper content (about 15% by mass or less with respect<br>
to the binder resin) of a gelling agent can be added to the binder<br>
resin as needed to crosslink the resin. In such a case, examples<br>
of the gelling agent to be used include aluminum alcoholates,<br>
aluminum chelate compounds and the like, and as preferable<br>
specific examples, aluminum triisopropoxide, mono-sec-butoxy<br>
aluminum diisopropoxide, aluminum tri-sec-butoxide, ethyl<br>
acetoacetate aluminum diisopropoxide, aluminum tris-ethyl<br>
acetoacetate and the like can be exemplified.<br>
[0013]<br>
As the petroleum solvent contained in the ink composition<br>
for offset printing of the present invention, solvents can be<br>
preferably used which are not compatible with water used as a<br><br>
6<br>
solvent for offset printing, and have a boiling point of 160°C<br>
or higher, preferably a boiling point of 200°C or higher.<br>
Specific examples of the solvent include: petroleum solvents<br>
such as a n-paraffinic solvent, an isoparaffinic solvent, a<br>
naphthenic solvent, an aromatic solvent, and an a-olefinic<br>
solvent; and mineral oils such as a light oil, a spindle oil,<br>
a machine oil, a cylinder oil, a turpentine oil, and mineral<br>
spirits. Although each of these solvents can be used alone or<br>
two or more kinds of these can be used in combination,<br>
non-aromatic solvents are preferably used considering the<br>
environmental issues and the like in recent years.<br>
The content of the petroleum solvent in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is 20% by mass or more, and<br>
preferably 40 to 53% by mass.<br>
[0014]<br>
As the vegetable oil component contained in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing of the present invention, at<br>
least one or more kinds selected from vegetable oils and fatty<br>
acid esters of the vegetable oil that are generally used for<br>
offset printing ink can be used. Specific examples of these<br>
include vegetable oils such as a linseed oil, a tung oil, and<br>
a soybean oil; fatty acid esters of these oils; and the like.<br>
The content of the vegetable oil component in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is 20% by mass or less,<br>
preferably 7 to 15% by mass, and more preferably 7 to 10% by<br>
mass.<br>
It should be noted that the total content of the petroleum<br>
solvent and the vegetable oil component used in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is to be 30 to 60% by mass.<br>
[0015]<br>
As the metal soap drier contained in the ink composition<br>
for offset printing of the present invention, substances<br>
conventionally used for ink for offset printing can be used,<br>
and examples thereof include metal salts or rare earth metal<br>
salts of octylic acid, naphthenic acid, resin acid, toll oil<br><br>
7<br>
fatty acid, soybean oil fatty acid, higher hydroxy fatty acid,<br>
and the like. Above metal includes cobalt, manganese, lead,<br>
zinc, copper, iron, calcium, zirconium, aluminum, and the like.<br>
In addition, above rare earth metal includes cerium and the like<br>
Specific examples of the metal soap drier include manganese<br>
octylate, cobalt octylate, zirconium octylate, calcium<br>
octylate, iron octylate, copper octylate, manganese<br>
naphthenate, cobalt naphthenate, zirconium naphthenate,<br>
calcium naphthenate, iron naphthenate, copper naphthenate, and<br>
the like. Each of these compounds can be used alone, or two<br>
or more kinds of these can be used in combination.<br>
The content of the metal soap drier in the ink composition<br>
for offset printing, based on the mass of the metal contained<br>
in the drier, is 0.008 to 0.7% by mass.<br>
[0016]<br>
The drier is generally added in a form of metal-soap<br>
solution, and "based on the mass of the metal contained in the<br>
drier" means that the content is based on the mass converted<br>
into the mass of only the metal component in the drier, that<br>
is, the mass calculated by multiplying the mass of the solid<br>
component in the metal soap drier by the mass ratio of the metal<br>
in the drier molecules. For example, in the case that 2 g of<br>
10% solution of manganese octylate [Mn(C7H15COOMn)2, molecular<br>
weight 341, Mn = 55] is contained in 100 g of an ink, "the content<br>
of the drier based on the weight of the metal" is (2 x 0.1 x<br>
55/34D/100 x 100 = 0.032 (% by mass) .<br>
In the case that the above-mentioned content is less than<br>
0 . 008% by mass, drying becomes insufficient under the condition<br>
in which a paper-face temperature is lower than 100°C; in the<br>
case that the content is more than 0.7% by mass, skinning occurs<br>
on the ink composition for offset printing during storage. The<br>
content is preferably 0.01 to 0.5% by mass.<br>
[0017]<br>
Examples of the polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative<br>
thereof, tocopherol, and tocotrienol contained in the ink<br><br>
8<br>
composition for offset printing of the present invention<br>
include: citric acid, ascorbic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid,<br>
citrate, ascorbate, succinate, adipate, ascorbyl palmitate,<br>
ascorbyl dipalmitate and the like as the polyvalent carboxylic<br>
acid and a derivative thereof; a-tocopherol, b-tocopherol,<br>
g-tocopherol, and d-tocopherol as tocopherol; a-tocotrienol,<br>
b-tocotrienol, g-tocotrienol, and d-tocotrienol as<br>
tocotrienol. Each of these compounds can be used alone, or two<br>
or more kinds of these can be used in combination. Examples<br>
of the polyvalent carboxylate include sodium ascorbate, sodium<br>
citrate, sodium succinate, and the like.<br>
The total content of the polyvalent carboxylic acid, the<br>
derivative thereof, tocopherol, and tocotrienol in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is 0.008 to 12% by mass. In<br>
the case that the above-mentioned content is less than 0.008%<br>
by mass, skinning occurs on the ink composition for offset<br>
printing during storage; in the case that the content is more<br>
than 12% by mass, drying becomes insufficient under the<br>
condition in which a paper-face temperature is lower than 100°C.<br>
The content is preferably 0.1 to 3% by mass.<br>
[0018]<br>
As a phenolic antioxidant contained in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing of the present invention,<br>
dibutylhydroxytoluene (BHT), butylhydroxyanisole (BHA),<br>
hydroquinone (HQ), t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ),<br>
methylhydroquinone, and the like can be used. Each of these<br>
compounds can be used alone, or two or more kinds of these can<br>
be used in combination.<br>
The content of the phenolic antioxidant in the ink<br>
composition for offset printing is 0.08 to 12% by mass . In the<br>
case that the above-mentioned content is less than 0.08% by mass,<br>
skinning may occur on the ink composition for offset printing<br>
during storage; in the case that the content is more than 12%<br>
by mass, drying may be insufficient under the condition in which<br>
a paper-face temperature is lower than 100°C. The content is<br><br>
9<br>
preferably 1 to 3% by mass.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to need, additives such as a pigment dispersant,<br>
an anti scumming aid, a friction-resistance improver, an<br>
antioffset agent, a nonionic surfactant, and the like can be<br>
used in the ink composition for offset printing of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0020]<br>
Next, the following description will discuss a method for<br>
preparing an ink composition for offset printing containing the<br>
above-mentioned constituent materials.<br>
The conventionally known methods (a dry grinding method,<br>
a flushing method, and the like) can be used for preparing an<br>
ink composition for offset printing of the present invention.<br>
For example, (1) an oil-based varnish for printing ink<br>
is prepared in advance by heating a binder resin and at least<br>
one of a vegetable oil component and a petroleum solvent, and<br>
further as needed a gelling agent. Next, a dried pigment, and<br>
as needed a vegetable oil component, a petroleum solvent, and<br>
a pigment dispersant are added to the oil-based varnish for<br>
printing ink, and then the resulting composition is ink-milled<br>
and dispersed with a bead mill, a three-roll mill, and the like;<br>
consequently a oil-based base for printing ink is obtained.<br>
Furthermore, a metal soap drier, a phenolic antioxidant, and<br>
at least one kind selected from the group consisting of a<br>
polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative thereof, tocopherol,<br>
and tocotrienol, are added to the oil-based base for printing<br>
ink, and further as needed an oil-based varnish for printing<br>
ink, a vegetable oil component, a petroleum solvent, and an<br>
additive are added, to adjust to a predetermined viscosity. (2)<br>
An oil-based varnish for printing ink is prepared in advance<br>
by heating a binder resin and at least one of a vegetable oil<br>
component and a petroleum solvent, and further as needed a<br>
gelling agent. The oil-based varnish for printing ink is added<br>
to a water suspension of the pigment (a water suspension formed<br><br>
10<br>
by adding water to a water-containing cake and a dried pigment)<br>
and then flushed by a flusher (a kneader), a stirring device<br>
having a mechanism of desolvation, or the like, thereby<br>
dehydrated until the water content in the flushed composition<br>
becomes preferably 2% by mass or less. Next, the oil-based<br>
varnish for printing ink and the like is added to the dehydrated<br>
composition as needed, and then the resulting composition is<br>
ink-milled and dispersed with a bead mill, a three roll mill,<br>
and the like; consequently a oil-based base for printing ink<br>
is obtained. Furthermore, a metal soap drier, a phenolic<br>
antioxidant, and at least one kind selected from the group<br>
consisting of a polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative<br>
thereof, tocopherol, and tocotrienol, are added to the<br>
oil-based base for printing ink, and further as needed, an<br>
oil-based varnish for printing ink, a vegetable oil component,<br>
a petroleum solvent, and an additive are added to adjust to a<br>
predetermined viscosity.<br>
[0021]<br>
The ink composition for offset printing of the present<br>
invention obtained by such constituent materials and such a<br>
preparing method can prevent skinning during storage, and has<br>
favorable stability on press in printing. Printing with a<br>
printing machine for heatset web offset printing allows the ink<br>
to be dried under the condition in which paper-face temperature<br>
becomes lower than 100°C.<br>

Table 1 in each ink composition for heatset web offset printing<br>
to be obtained, and then stirred; consequently ink compositions<br>
for heatset web offset printing of Examples 1 to 19 and<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 8 were obtained.<br>
Here, "ascorbic acid derivative" and "ascorbate" in Table<br>
1 are respectively ascorbyl dipalmitate and sodium ascorbate.<br>
[0026]<br><evaluation test><br>
[Skinning test]<br>
10 g of the ink composition for heatset web offset<br>
printing of each of Examples 1 to 19 and Comparative Examples<br>
1 to 8 was put in a can (about 3 cm in diameter, about 1 cm in<br>
depth) and covered with a lid to store at 100°C. When a skin<br>
was generated and the ink composition for heatset web offset<br>
printing did not stick to a finger, it was judged that skinning<br>
occurred. The numbers of days to skinning were shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
[0027]<br>
[Drying temperature]<br>
0.1 cc of the ink composition for heatset web offset<br>
printing of each of Examples 1 to 19 and Comparative Examples<br>
1 to 8 was developed on a coated paper with a RI tester (machinery<br>
number RI-2, manufactured by Akira Seisakusho Co.), and then<br>
allowed to pass through a conveyer type drying apparatus<br>
(manufactured by Asahi Kagaku Co., Ltd.) two times. Thereafter,<br>
a white paper was put on the ink-developed face of the coated<br>
paper, sandwiched between a rubber roller and a metal roller<br>
of the RI tester, and pressurized at a predetermined pressure<br>
for two minutes. The paper-face temperature at which the white<br>
paper was not stained with the ink composition for heatset web<br>
offset printing was judged as a drying temperature. Results<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br><br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0029]<br>
The ink composition for offset printing of the present<br>
invention obtained by such constituent materials and such a<br>
preparing method can prevent skinning during storage, and has<br>
favorable stability on press in printing. Printing with a<br>
printing machine for heatset type web offset printing allows<br>
the ink composition to be dried under the condition in which<br>
paper-face temperature is low.<br><br>

CLAIMS<br>
1.	An ink composition for heatset offset printing<br>
containing a pigment, a binder resin, a petroleum solvent, and<br>
at least one kind of vegetable oil component selected from the<br>
group consisting of a vegetable oil and a fatty acid ester of<br>
the vegetable oil,<br>
the content of said vegetable oil component being 20% by<br>
mass or less, and<br>
said ink composition further containing: 0.008 to 0.7%<br>
by mass of a metal soap drier based on the mass of the metal<br>
contained in the drier; 0.008 to 12% by mass of at least one<br>
kind selected from the group consisting of a polyvalent<br>
carboxylic acid, a derivative of the polyvalent carboxylic acid,<br>
tocopherol, and tocotrienol; and 0.08 to 12% by mass of a<br>
phenolic antioxidant.<br>
2.	The ink composition for heatset offset printing<br>
according to claim 1,<br>
wherein said polyvalent carboxylic acid and the<br>
derivative of said polyvalent carboxylic acid are at least one<br>
kind selected from the group consisting of: citric acid;<br>
ascorbic acid; succinic acid; adipic acid; and derivatives of<br>
citric acid, ascorbic acid, succinic acid, and adipic acid.<br><br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an ink composition for heatset offset printing which has an excellent drying property, does not cause skinning during storage of ink<br>
composition, and has excellent stability on press in printing. The present invention is an ink composition for heatset offset printing containing a pigment, a binder resin, a petroleum<br>
solvent, and at least one kind of vegetable oil component selected from the group consisting of a vegetable oil and a fatty acid ester thereof, the content of the vegetable oil component<br>
being 20% by mass or less, and the ink composition further containing: 0.008 to 0.7% by mass of a metal soap drier based on the mass of the metal contained in the drier; 0.008 to 12%<br>
by mass of at least one kind selected from the group consisting of a polyvalent carboxylic acid, a derivative thereof, tocopherol, and tocotrienol; and 0.08 to 12% by mass of a<br>
phenolic antioxidant.<br></evaluation></preparation></td>
