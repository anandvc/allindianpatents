a protective member 3 6 are arranged to face each other with<br>
a gap therebetween and are also overlapped to each other in<br>
a plan view.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to solve]<br>
[0004]<br>
The above-mentioned main switch 35 is fixed to the bracket 39 using the fixing bolts 40 and the protective member 36 is fixed to the bracket 39 using the fixing bolt 41. Accordingly, if a number of parts can be reduced by improving the fixing method of the main switch 35 and the protective member 36, it is possible to reduce a cost.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to reduce the number of parts and also to reduce a cost by improving a handle lock device protective structure of a motorcycle.<br>
[Means for solving the problem] [0005]<br>
The present invention according to claim 1 is characterized in that, in a motorcycle which mounts a handle<br>
lock device on one of a steering handle side and a head pipe side which supports the steering handle and which is capable of locking a locking pin which is reciprocally mounted in the handle lock device to another of the steering handle side and the head pipe side, to either one of the steering handle side and the head pipe side, a protective member which protects the lock pin of the handle lock device is jointly mounted together with the steering handle lock device by fastening. [0006]<br>
When the handle lock device and the protective member are jointly mounted to either one of the steering handle side and the head pipe side by fastening using bolts, for example, and the locking pin which is reciprocally mounted in the handle lock device is projected from the handle lock device, the locking pin is protected by the protective member and hence, a theft of the motorcycle can be prevented. [0007]<br>
The present invention according to claim 2 is, in the above-mentioned constitution, characterized in that the handle lock device is preferably mounted on a lower portion of a top bridge which supports the steering handle and connects left and right front forks and, at the same time, a pair of left and right downwardly extending members are provided to the protective member, and the downwardly extending members are arranged to cover an outer portion of the lock pin.<br>
Since the outer portion of the lock pin which projects from the handle lock device mounted on the lower portion of the top bridge is covered with the downwardly extending members provided to the left and right sides of the protective member, it is possible to protect the lock pin thus preventing a theft of the motorcycle. [0008]<br>
The present invention according to claim 3 is, in the above-mentioned constitution, characterized in that the cowl support stay which supports the cowl is preferably arranged in front of the head pipe, and on the cowl support stay, a second protective member which extends toward a mounting portion of the handle lock device to the top bridge is integrally formed. [0009]<br>
The mounting portion of the handle lock device to the top bridge is protected by the second protective member which is integrally mounted on the cowl support stay. It is possible to prevent a theft of the motorcycle using the second protective member together with the protective member which is jointly fastened with the handle lock device. [Advantage of the Invention] [0010]<br>
In the present invention according to claim 1, the protective member is jointly mounted together with the steering handle lock device by fastening to either one of the<br>
steering handle side and the head pipe side. To compare with a mounting structure that the handle lock device and the protective member are separately mounted using bolts and nuts or the like, according to the present invention, the handle lock device and the protective member are jointly mounted by fastening using the same bolts or the like and hence, it is possible to reduce the number of parts and the cost can be reduced. [0011]<br>
In the present invention according to claim 2, the handle lock device is mounted on the lower portion of the top bridge and, at the same time, the downwardly extending members which are provided to the left and right portions of the protective member are arranged to cover an outer portion of the lock pin. Accordingly, it is possible to arrange the lock pin of the lock device which is jointly fastened and the downwardly extending members close to each other whereby lengths of the downwardly extending members can be shortened and the protective members can be miniaturized and can be made light-weighted. [0012]<br>
In the present invention according to claim 3, the second protective member which protects the mounting portion of the handle lock device to the top bridge is mounted on the cowl support stay and hence, it is possible to enhance a protective function of the handle lock device by using the second<br>
protective member together with the above-mentioned protective member which is jointly fastened with the handle lock device.<br>

The handle lock device 56 also functions as a main switch and includes sideward projecting portions 56a, 56b (the sideward projecting portion 56b on a depth side not shown in the drawing) on a side surface a main body portion 56c thereof. The sideward projecting portions 56a, 56b are respectively portions where through holes 56d and facing portions 56e which are formed on end portions of the through holes 56d are formed. [0037]<br>
The pin protective member 187 forms two mounting holes 187a therein. By inserting two hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 in the respective through holes 56d, the respective mounting holes 187a and the respective bolt insertion holes 212a and by threadedly engaging the hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 with the respective nuts 213, the pin protective member 187 is jointly fastened to the top bridge 53 together with the handle lock device 56. [0038]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, according to the present invention, in the motorcycle 10 which mounts the handle lock device 56 on one of bar handle 11 (see Fig. 1) side which constitutes the steering handle side and the head pipe 21 (see Fig. 2) side which supports a bar handle 11 and is capable of locking the locking pin 186 which is reciprocally mounted in the handle lock device 56 to another of the steering handle side and the head pipe side, to either one of the bar handle<br>
11 side and the head pipe 21 side, the pin protective member 187 which constitutes a protective member which protects the lock pin 186 of the handle lock device 56 is jointly mounted together with the handle lock device 56 by fastening. [0039]<br>
Since the pin protective member 187 is jointly mounted together with the handle lock device 56 to either one of the bar handle 11 and the head pipe 21 by fastening, compared to a case in which the bar handle 11 and the pin protective member 187 are respectively separately mounted using bolts and nuts or the like, in the present invention, it is possible to jointly mount the handle lock device 56 and the pin protective member 187 by fastening using the same hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 and hence, the number of parts can be reduced and a cost can be reduced. [0040]<br>
Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the pin protective member according to the present invention, wherein the pin protective member 187 is formed of a simple press-formed member having the following constitution. That is, the pin protective member 187 is formed of a simple press formed member which is constituted of a planar bridge-side mounting portion 187b which is mounted on the top bridge 53 (see Fig. 2) and a pair of left and right downwardly extending members 187c, 187d which are bent downwardly from left and right ends of the bridge-side<br>
mounting portion 187b, wherein mounting holes 187a, 187a are<br>
formed in the bridge-side mounting portion 187b.<br>
[0041]<br>
Fig. 5 is an explanatory view for explaining the handle lock device protective structure according to the present invention and corresponds to a view as viewed in the direction of an arrow 4 in Fig. 2.<br>
The pin protective member 187 is constituted by arranging the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d on the left and right sides of lock pin 186 of the handle lock device 56. In the drawing, the handle lock device 56 and the pin protective member 187 are arranged on a position when a vehicle advances straightly (numeral 215 indicating a straight line extended in the longitudinal direction) and the lock pin 186 is in a state that the lock pin 186 is stored in the inside of the handle lock device 56. [0042]<br>
Numeral 187e in the drawing indicates a curved portion indented toward a front portion of the vehicle which connects rear peripheries of the left and right downwardly extending members 187c, 187d. By forming the curved portion 187e in the pin protective member 187 in this manner, it is possible to prevent the formation of a straight gap between the pin protective member 187 and the cylindrical portions 188, 191. Accordingly, when the lock pin 186 projects from the handle<br>
lock device 56, it is possible to prevent the lock pin 186 from<br>
being easily cut.<br>
[0043]<br>
Further, the cowl support stay 5 7 which is mounted on the top bridge 53 and the bottom bridge 54 (see Fig. 2) includes the mounting portion protective bar 164 in one member 162, wherein a distal end portion of the mounting portion protective bar 164 is overlapped to one hexagonal socket head cap bolt 185, to be more specific, a hexagonal socket 185a. [0044]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 described above, the present invention is characterized in that the cowl support stay 57 which supports the front cowl 12 (see Fig. 1) is formed on the front portion of the head pipe 21, and, on the cowl support stay 57, a mounting portion of the handle lock device 56 on the top ridge 53, to be more specific, the mounting portion protective bar 164 which extends toward the hexagonal socket 185a of the hexagonal socket head cap bolt 185 and constitutes a second protective member is integrally formed. [0045]<br>
Since the mounting portion protective bar 164 which protects the hexagonal socket head cap bolt 185 which mounts the handle lock device 56 on the top bridge 53 is formed on the cowl support stay 57, it is possible to protect the hexagonal socket 185a of the hexagonal socket head cap bolts<br>
185 by the mounting portion protective bar 164 whereby, together with the pin protective member 187 which is jointly fastened with the above-mentioned handle lock device 56, it is possible to enhance the protective function for the handle lock device 56. [0046]<br>
The manner of operation of the handle lock device protective structure described above is explained hereinafter.<br>
Fig. 6 is an operational view showing an operation of the handle lock device protective structure according to the present invention.<br>
To perform the handle locking, the bar handle is turned<br>
by an angle a at maximum to the right, for example, from the position which is taken when the vehicle advances straightly so as to integrally rotate the top bridge 53, the handle lock device 56, the pin protective member 187, and the mounting portion protective bar 164 of the cowl support stay 57 with<br>
the bar handle by the angle a. [0047]<br>
Then, when the key is inserted into the handle lock device 56 and is turned to a position "LOCK", the lock pin 186 of the handle lock device 56 projects to the outside from the inside and enters the inside of a hollow portion 191a of one cylindrical portion 191 on the head pipe 21 side. Accordingly,<br>
 <br>
the handle locking is completed. [0048]<br>
For example, even when an attempt is made to cut the lock pin 186 through a gap between the handle lock device 56 and the cylindrical portion 191 using a metal cutting saw as indicated by a straight line 217 in the drawing for a theft, the metal cutting saw is engaged with the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d of the pin protective member 187 and hence, it is necessary to cut the lock pin 186 together with the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d thus requiring a large amount of time. Accordingly, it is possible to enhance a theft preventing effect with the provision of the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d of the pin protective member 187 . [0049]<br>
Further, even an attempt is made to cut the lock pin 18 6 as indicated by a straight line 218 in the drawing, the metal cutting saw is engaged with the bridge-side mounting portion 187b of the pin protective member 187 and the body portion 56a of the handle lock device 56 thus also making the cutting of the lock pin 186 difficult. [0050]<br>
Further, even when an attempt is made to turn the hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 to remove the handle lock device 56 from the top bridge 53, although one hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 can be turned, another hexagonal socket head<br>
cap bolts 185 has the hexagonal socket 185a thereof covered with the mounting portion protective bar 164 and hence, it is possible to insert a hexagonal wrench into the hexagonal socket 185a whereby the hexagonal socket head cap bolts 185 cannot be loosened. Accordingly, with the provision of the mounting portion protective bar 164, it is possible to further enhance the theft preventing effect. [0051]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, the present invention is characterized in that the handle lock device 56 is mounted on a lower portion of the top bridge 53 which supports the bar handle 11 which constitutes the steering handle and connects left and right front forks 36 and, at the same time, the pair of left and right downwardly extending members 187c, 187d (see Fig. 4) are provided to the pin protective member 187, and the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d are arranged to cover the outer portion of the lock pin 186. [0052]<br>
By mounting the handle lock device 56 on the lower portion of the top bridge 53 and, at the same time, by covering the outer portion of the lock pin 186 with the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d which are provided to the left and right sides of the pin protective member 187, it is possible to arrange the lock pin 186 of the jointly fastened handle lock device 56 and the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d close<br>
to each other and hence, it is possible to shorten lengths of the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d whereby the pin protective  member  187  can  be  miniaturized  and  made light-weighted. [0053]<br>
Here, although the pin protective member 187 is formed separately from the top bridge 53 as shown in Fig. 3 in this embodiment, the downwardly extending members 187c, 187d (symbol 187d not shown in the drawing) may be integrally formed on the lower support member 212 of the top bridge 53. [0054]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 5, although the mounting portion protective bar 164 is formed on one main bar 162 of the cowl support stay 57, the present invention is not limited to such a constitution and the mounting portion protective bar may be mounted on other main bar 161. [0055] [Industrial Applicability]<br>
