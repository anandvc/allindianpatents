				<td>HISTAMINE H3 RECEPTOR AGENTS, PREPARATION AND<br>
THERAPEUTIC USES<br>
This patent application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/603,628 filed August 23, 2004.<br>
The present invention relates to novel heteroaromatic aryl compounds, and to the<br>
use of these compounds as pharmaceutical compositions, to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising the compounds, to methods of treatment employing these compounds and<br>
compositions, and to intermediates and methods for making these compounds.<br>
The histamine H3 receptor is relatively neuron specific and inhibits the release of<br>
a number of monoamines, including histamine. The histamine H3 receptor is a<br>
presynaptic autoreceptor and hetero receptor located both in the central and the peripheral<br>
nervous system. The histamine H3 receptor regulates the release of histamine and other<br>
neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and acetylcholine. These are examples of histamine<br>
H3 receptor mediated responses. Recent evidence suggests that the H3 receptor shows<br>
intrinsic, constitutive activity, in vitro as well as in vivo (i.e. it is active in the absence of<br>
an agonist). Compounds acting as inverse agonists can inhibit this activity. A histamine<br>
H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist would therefore be expected to increase the<br>
release of H3 receptor-regulated neurotransmitters in the brain. A histamine H3 receptor<br>
agonist, on the contrary, leads to an inhibition of the biosynthesis of histamine and an<br>
inhibition of the release of histamine and also of other neurotransmitters such as serotonin<br>
and acetylcholine. These findings suggest that histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse<br>
agonists, and antagonists could be important mediators of neuronal activity, and the<br>
activities of other cells that may express this receptor. Inverse agonism or selective<br>
antagonism of the histamine H3 receptor raises brain levels of histamine, and other<br>
monoamines, and inhibits activities such as food consumption while minimizing non-<br>
specific peripheral consequences. By this mechanism, H3R inverse agonists or<br>
antagonists induce a prolonged wakefulness, improved cognitive function, reduction in<br>
food intake, and normalization of vestibular reflexes. Accordingly, the histamine H3<br>
receptor is an important target for new therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease, mood and<br>
attention adjustments, cognitive deficiencies, obesity, dizziness, schizophrenia, epilepsy,<br>
sleeping disorders, narcolepsy, and motion sickness.<br>
Histamine mediates its activity via four receptor subtypes, H1R, H2R, H3R and a<br>
newly identified receptor designated GPRv53 [(Oda T., et al., J.Biol.Chem. 275 (47):<br>
36781-6 (2000)]. Alternative names for this receptor are PORT3 or H4R. Although<br>
relatively selective ligands have been developed for H1R, H2R and H3R, few specific<br>
ligands have been developed that can distinguish H3R from H4R. H4R is a widely<br>
distributed receptor found at high levels in human leukocytes. Activation or inhibition of<br>
this receptor could result in undesirable side effects when targeting antagonism of the<br>
H3R receptor. The identification of the H4R receptor has fundamentally changed<br>
histamine biology and must be considered in the development of histamine H3 receptor<br>
antagonists.<br>
Some histamine H3 receptor antagonists were created which resembled histamine<br>
in possessing an imidazole ring generally substituted in the 4(5) position (Ganellin et al.,<br>
Ars Pharmaceutica, 1995, 36:3,455-468). A variety of patents and patent applications<br>
directed to antagonists and agonists having such structures include EP 197840, EP<br>
494010, WO 97/29092, WO 96/38141, and W096/38142. These imidazole-containing<br>
compounds have the disadvantage of poor blood-brain barrier penetration, interaction<br>
with cytochrome P-450 proteins, and hepatic and ocular toxicities. Recently, other<br>
imidazole and non-imidazole ligands of the histamine H3 receptor have been described.<br>
The compounds of the present invention differ in structure from the compounds described<br>
in the art.<br>
There remains a need for improved treatments using alternative or improved<br>
pharmaceutical agents that act as histamine H3 receptor agonists, inverse agonists, or<br>
antagonists, to modulate H3 receptor activity, and treat the diseases that could benefit<br>
from H3 receptor modulation. The present invention provides such a contribution to the<br>
art based on the finding that a novel class of heteroaromatic aryl compounds have a high<br>
affinity, selective, and potent activity at the histamine H3 receptor. The subject invention<br>
is distinct in the particular structures and their activities.<br>

synthesis of the examples named herein by methods included herein, and supplemented<br>
by methods known in the art, to create positron emission topography (PET) ligands that<br>
bind to histamine H3 receptors and are useful for PET imaging.<br>
The invention includes tautomers, enantiomers, and other stereoisomers of the<br>
compounds. Thus, as one skilled in the art knows, certain aryls may exist in tautomeric<br>
forms. Such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention. It will be<br>
understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of Formula I or Formula II<br>
are meant to also include enantiomers and racemic mixtures, and the pharmaceutical salts<br>
thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the<br>
same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures.<br>
The three-dimensional structures are called configurations. As used herein, the term<br>
"enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror<br>
images of one another. The term "chiral center" refers to a carbon atom to which four<br>
different groups are attached. As used herein, the term "diastereomers" refers to<br>
stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two diastereomers which have a<br>
different configuration at only one chiral center are referred to herein as "epimers." The<br>
terms "racemate," "racemic mixture" or "racemic modification" refer to a mixture of<br>
equal parts of enantiomers.<br>
The term "enantiomeric enrichment" as used herein refers to the increase in the<br>
amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing<br>
the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or "ee,"<br>
which is found using the following equation:<br><br>
wherein E1 is the amount of the first enantiomer and E2 is the amount of the second<br>
enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is present in<br>
a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final ratio of<br>
70:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 40%. However, if the<br>
final ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of greater<br>
than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of greater<br>
than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily determined by<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures, such as gas or<br>
high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of the appropriate<br>
chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the enantiomeric<br>
pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the<br>
specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of Formula I or Formula II can be<br>
prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes,<br>
such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, et al., "Enantiomers. Racemates, and Resolutions,"<br>
John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen," Stereochemistry of<br>
Organic Compounds." (Wiley-Interscience 1994), and European Patent Application No.<br>
EP-A-838448, published April 29,1998. Examples of resolutions include<br>
recrystallization techniques or chiral chromatography.<br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention have one or more chiral centers<br>
and may exist in a variety of stereoisomers configurations. As a consequence of these<br>
chiral centers, the compounds of the present invention occur as racemates, mixtures of<br>
enantiomers, and as individual enantiomers, as well as diastereomers and mixtures of<br>
diastereomers. All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The terms "R" and "S" are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to<br>
denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R" (rectus) refers to that<br>
configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest<br>
to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The<br>
term "S" (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise<br>
relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond<br>
toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic<br>
number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A partial list of priorities and a<br>
discussion of stereochemistry is contained in "Nomenclature of Organic Compounds:<br>
Principles and Practice", (J.H. Fletcher, et al., eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.<br>
The designation" ~""- " refers to a bond that protrudes forward out of the plane<br>
of the page. The designation....."" " refers to a bond that protrudes backward out of the<br>
plane of the page. The designation " "^^ " refers to a bond wherein the stereochemistry<br>
or organic acid. For exemplification of pharmaceutical acid addition salts see, e.g.,<br>
Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1,1977. Since<br>
compounds of this invention can be basic in nature, they accordingly react with any of a<br>
number of inorganic and organic acids to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts.<br>
The pharmaceutical acid addition salts of the invention are typically formed by<br>
reacting the compound of Formula I or Formula II with an equimolar or excess amount of<br>
acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like. The salts<br>
normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to about ten days and can be<br>
isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and acids commonly employed to form such salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and organic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic<br>
acid, /?-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid,<br>
acetic acid and the like. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus are the<br>
sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate,<br>
dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate,<br>
propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate,<br>
propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate,<br>
butyne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate,<br>
dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate,<br>
xylenesulfonate, phenyl acetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate,<br>
p-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate,<br>
naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like.<br>
The term "base addition salt" refers to a salt of a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I or Formula II with a mineral<br>
or organic base. For exemplification of pharmaceutical base addition salts see, e.g.,<br>
Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1, 1977. The<br>
present invention also contemplates pharmaceutical base addition salts of compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II. The skilled artisan would appreciate that some compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II may be acidic in nature and accordingly react with any of a<br>
number of inorganic and organic bases to form pharmaceutical base addition salts.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutical base addition salts are the ammonium, lithium, potassium,<br>
sodium, calcium, magnesium, methylamino, diethylamino, ethylene diamino,<br>
cyclohexylamino, and ethanolamino salts, and the like of a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or Formula II, when existing as a diastereomeric<br>
mixture, may be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example,<br>
fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or<br>
a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into<br>
individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically<br>
active acid as a resolving agent. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of<br>
Formula I or Formula II may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure<br>
starting materials or reagents of known configuration or through enantioselective<br>
synthesis.<br>
The compounds of Formula I or Formula II can be prepared by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art following a variety of procedures, some of which are illustrated in the<br>
procedures and schemes set forth below. The particular order of steps required to produce<br>
the compounds of Formula I or Formula II is dependent upon the particular compound to<br>
being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative liability of the substituted<br>
moieties. The reagents or starting materials are readily available to one of skill in the art,<br>
and to the extent not commercially available, are readily synthesized by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art following standard procedures commonly employed in the art, along with<br>
the various procedures and schemes set forth below.<br>
The following Preparations and Examples are provided to better elucidate the<br>
practice of the present invention and should not be interpreted in any way as to limit the<br>
scope of the same. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various modifications may<br>

drops DMF, in a suitable solvent, eg. THF, toluene, dichloromethane, or chloroform, by<br>
stirring within a temperature range of 10 to 100 °C for a period of 0.5 to 24 hours. The<br>
reaction is concentrated and the crude acid chloride is treated with a suitable amine and a<br>
proton scavenger, eg. triethylamine, pyridine etc., to give the desired amide (All).<br>
For example, sodium-4-(4-pyridin-3-yl-thiazol-2-yl)-benzoic acid is slurried in a<br>
suitable solvent such as toluene with oxalyl chloride, and catalytic dimethylformamide.<br>
The mixture is heated to reflux for 2 minutes and then allowed to stir at ambient<br>
temperature for 2 hours. The reaction is concentrated, triturated with dichloromethane,<br>
and is concentrated to give the acid chloride intermediate which is used without<br>
purification. The acid chloride is dissolved in dichloromethane and added to a mixture of<br>
(S)-(+)-l-(2-pyrrolidinyl-methyl)pyrrolidine and pyridine and stirred for 20 minutes. The<br>
resulting mixture may be concentrated, extracted, and purified according to techniques<br>
well known in the art.<br><br>
In Scheme B, Ra, Ra-, Rt» Rc, Het', and Y are as defined previously. Rj can be H,<br>
alkyl or cycloalkyl; Re can be and is not limited to H or the corresponding methyl, ethyl,<br>
benzyl esters. In Scheme B (step 1), aryl esters or acids of formula BIV (wherein Re =<br>
Methyl, Ethyl, H) substituted with halogen X, where X can be CI, Br, or I combined with<br>
an heteroaromatic boronic acid of formula Bill (wherein Rd = H) or ester (wherein Rd =<br>
pinacol) are converted to the corresponding heteroaromatic-aryl compound of formula<br>
BVII. Alternatively, in Scheme B (step 1), heteroaromatic chlorides, bromides or iodides<br>
of formula B V can be combined with aryl acid or ester substituted boronates (wherein Rd<br>
= pinacol) or boronic acids of formula B VI (wherein Rd = H) to give the corresponding<br>
heteroaromatic-aryl compound of formula BVII. Both routes to these heteroaromatic-aryl<br>
compounds (BVII) can be achieved by a variety of palladium catalyzed Suzuki reaction<br>
methods as described in Section IV-14 of the following review (Hassan, Jwanro;<br>
Sevignon, Marc; Gozzi, Christel; Schulz, Emmanuelle; Lemaire, Marc; Aryl-Aryl Bond<br>
Formation One Century after the Discovery of the Ullmann Reaction. Chemical Reviews<br>
(Washington, D. C.) (2002), 102(5), 1359-1469). For example, 5-Bromo-thiophene-2-<br>
sulfonic acid amide and 4-methoxycarbonylphenyl boronic acid are dissolved in a<br>
suitable organic solvent such as dioxane, acetonitrile, DME, THF, Ethanol, or mixtures<br>
thereof. A suitable palladium catalyst such as tetrakis- (triphenylphosphine) palladium<br>
(O), palladium (II) dichloride (dppf) complex with dichloromethane, dichloropalladium<br>
di-triphenylphosphine etc., is added followed by a suitable base such as aqueous sodium<br>
or potassium carbonate, anhydrous cesium or potassium fluoride, anhydrous potassium or<br>
cesium carbonate etc. The reaction is heated within a temperature range of 70 to 100 C<br>
for a period of 4 to 24 hours. The reaction is concentrated and purified according to<br>
techniques well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the heteroaromatic-aryl compound (BVII) formation (step 1) can<br>
also be performed using microwave assisted Suzuki couplings. For example l-(5-bromo-<br>
thiophen-2-yl)-2-methyl-propan-l-one and 4-methoxycarbonylphenyl boronic acid are<br>
dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as dioxane, acetonitrile, DME, THF, Ethanol,<br>
or mixtures thereof. A suitable palladium catalyst such as tetrakis- (triphenylphosphine)<br>
palladium (O), palladium (II) dichloride (dppf) complex with dichloromethane,<br>
dichloropalladium di-triphenylphosphine etc., is added followed by a suitable base such<br>
as aqueous sodium or potassium carbonate, anhydrous cesium or potassium fluoride,<br>
anhydrous potassium or cesium carbonate etc. The reaction is run in a CEM® or<br>
MARS® microwave reactor for 10 to 40 minutes, at 90 to 120 °C, with 75 W power and<br>
cooling control on to maintain temperature range. The reaction is concentrated and<br>
purified according to techniques well known in the art.<br>
In Scheme B, Step 2, the resulting esters (BVII) (wherein Re = Methyl, Ethyl,<br>
Benzyl etc.), can be saponified using standard conditions to yield the corresponding<br>
heteroaromatic-aryl carboxylic acids or the lithium, sodium or potassium salt of the acid<br>
of the corresponding formula B VIII where Rb can be H, Li, Na or K. For example 4-(5-<br>
isobutyryl-thiophen-2-yl)-benzoic acid methyl ester is dissolved in a suitable solvent such<br>
as methanol or dioxane and aqueous LiOH is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at<br>
room temperature overnight or can be heated to 50 °C for 30 min to 18 hours. The solvent<br>
is removed in vacuo and the acid or salt isolated according to techniques well known in<br>
the art.<br>
In Scheme B (step 3), the carboxylic acids or the corresponding lithium, sodium<br>
or potassium salts (BVIII) (wherein Rb=H, Li, Na, K are converted to the amides (BII) by<br>
the methods described in Scheme A (step 1).<br><br>
In Scheme C, Ra, Ra', Re, Ar, X and Y are as defined previously. In Scheme C<br>
(step 1), the carboxylic acids of formula CIX are converted to the amides of formula CX<br>
by the methods described in Scheme A (step 1).<br>
For example, 4-bromobenzoic acid-2,5-dioxo-pyrrolidin-l-yl ester [which can be<br>
prepared from 4-bromobenzoic acid and N-hydroxy succinamide by standard conditions<br>
(C. Mitsos, Chem Pharm Bull 48(2),211-214(2000)] in a suitable solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, is added a suitable amine in this case (S)-(+)-l-(2-<br>
pyrrolidinylmemyOpyrrolidine and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for a period of<br>
1-12 hours. The reaction is concentrated and purified according to techniques well<br>
known in the art.<br>
In Scheme C (step 2) these heteroaromatic-aryl amides (CII) can be achieved by a<br>
variety of palladium catalyzed Suzuki reaction methods as described under Scheme B.<br>
For example, 4-(2-pyrrolidin- 1-ylmethyl-pyrrolidine- l-carbonyl)-phenyl bromide and 5-<br>
phenyl-2-thienyl boronic acid are dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as dioxane,<br>
acetonitrile, DME, THF, Ethanol, or mixtures thereof. A suitable palladium catalyst such<br>
as tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine) palladium (O), palladium(II) dichloride (dppf) complex<br>
with dichloromethane, dichloropalladium di-triphenylphosphine etc., is added followed<br>
by a suitable base such as aqueous sodium or potassium carbonate, anhydrous cesium or<br>
potassium fluoride, anhydrous potassium or cesium carbonate etc. The reaction is heated<br>
within a temperature range of 70 to 100 °C for a period of 4 to 24 hours, alternatively<br>
reaction is run in a CEM® or MARS® microwave reactor for 10 to 40 minutes, at 90 to<br>
110 °C, with 75 W power and cooling control on to maintain temperature range. The<br>
reaction is concentrated and purified according to techniques well known in the art.<br><br>
In Scheme D, Ra, Ras Rc and Rd, Y and HET' are as previously defined. In<br>
Scheme D (stepl), pyrrolidinylmethylpyrrolidine or methylpyrrolidinylmethylpyrrolidine<br>
amides (DXII) of commercially available (Aldrich) 4-(4,4,5,5-Tetramethyl- [1,3,2]<br>
dioxaborolan-2-yl)-benzoic acid can be prepared by the acid chloride procedure in<br>
Scheme A, step 1. For example, 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl- [1,3,2] dioxaborolan-2-yl)-<br>
benzoic acid is dissolved in lOmL of CH2CI2 with 4-5 drops of DMF and stirred while<br>
oxalyl chloride is added. Reaction is refluxed for a period of 1-12 hours and excess oxalyl<br>
chloride is removed in vacuo. The residue is dissolved in a suitable solvent in this case<br>
CH2CI2 to make acid chloride solution and is added to a solution of a suitable amine in<br>
this case 2-(R)-methyl-l- (2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethyl) pyrrolidine and a proton scavenger<br>
i.e. triethylamine in CH2CI2. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for a period of 30<br>
minutes to 12 hours. The resulting mixture may be concentrated, extracted, and purified<br>
according to techniques well known in the art.<br>
In Scheme D (step 2) the boronic ester (DXII) formed in Scheme D (step 1) can be<br>
converted to heteroaromatic-aryl amide (DII) using the Suzuki coupling methods<br>
described in Schemes B and C. For example, 4-bromo-thiophene-2-carbonitrile and [2-<br>
(S)-(2-(R)-memyl-pyaolidin-l-ylrnethyl)-pyrrolidin-l-yl]-[4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl- [1,3,2]<br>
dioxaborolan-2-yl)-phenyl]-methanone are dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as<br>
dioxane, acetonitrile, DME, THF, EtOH (ethanol), or mixtures thereof. A suitable<br>
palladium catalyst such as tetrakis- (triphenylphosphine) palladium (O), palladium (II)<br>
dichloride (dppf) complex with dichloromethane, dichloropalladium di-<br>
triphenylphosphine etc., is added followed by a suitable base such as aqueous sodium or<br>
potassium carbonate, anhydrous cesium or potassium fluoride, anhydrous potassium or<br>
cesium carbonate etc. The reaction is the reaction is heated within a temperature range of<br>
70 to 100 °C for a period of 4 to 24 hours, or alternatively run in a CEM® or MARS®<br>
microwave reactor for 10 to 40 minutes, at 90 to 120 °C, with 75 W power and cooling<br>
control on to maintain temperature range. The reaction is concentrated and purified<br>
according to techniques well known in the art.<br><br>
In Scheme E, R„ R,-, Re and Y are as previously defined. Rg is any functional group that<br>
can be further modified to Rh via alkylation, acylation, oxidation, reduction, sulfonylation<br>
etc. In Scheme E (step 1), wherein Rg = nitrile, Rg can be converted to a primary amide<br>
using known oxidation conditions. For example, 1.5 mL DMSO solution of 5-[4-(2(S) -<br>
pyrrolidin-1 -ylmethyl-pyrrolidine-1 -carbonyI)-phenyl]-thiophene-2-carbonitriIe (Rf =<br>
CN) is stirred at room temperature while K2CO3 (55 mg, 0.4 mmol) and 0.2 mL H?0 is<br>
added, then 30% H2O2 and is stirred one hour. The reaction is concentrated and purified<br>
according to techniques well known in the art.<br><br>
In Scheme F, R„ Ra-, R« and Y are as previously defined. Rj is any functional<br>
group that can be further cyclizcd with suitable reagents to form a heterocycle not limited<br>
to acid chloride, acid, amide, urea, thiourea etc and Rj can be but is not limited to alkyl,<br>
aryl, cyano, sulfone, sulfonamide, amide etc. For example, in Scheme F, Step 1, 4-<br>
thiocarbamoyl-benzoic acid ethyl ester (R, = thioamide) is heated with 2-bromo-l-<br>
pyridin-3-yl ethanone; hydrobromide to provide the corresponding thiazolc (FXVI, where<br>

The pharmaceutical salts of the invention are typically formed by reacting a<br>
compound of Formula I or Formula II with an equimolar or excess amount of acid or<br>
base. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like for acid addition<br>
salts, or water, an alcohol or a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane for base<br>
addition salts. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to<br>
about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.<br>
Acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts are<br>
inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid,<br>
carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the<br>
like. Preferred pharmaceutical acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and sulfuric acid, and those formed with<br>
organic acids such as maleic acid, tartaric acid, and methanesulfonic acid.<br>
Bases commonly employed to form pharmaceutical base addition salts are<br>
inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides,<br>
carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this<br>
invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate,<br>
calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and the like. The potassium and sodium salt<br>
forms are particularly preferred.<br>
The optimal time for performing the reactions of the Schemes, Preparations, and<br>
Procedures can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction via conventional<br>
chromatographic techniques. Furthermore, it is preferred to conduct the reactions of the<br>
invention under an inert atmosphere, such as, for example, argon, or, particularly,<br>
nitrogen. Choice of solvent is generally not critical so long as the solvent employed is<br>
inert to the ongoing reaction and sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to effect the desired<br>
reaction. The compounds are preferably isolated and purified before their use in<br>
subsequent reactions. Some compounds may crystallize out of the reaction solution<br>
during their formation and then collected by filtration, or the reaction solvent may be<br>
removed by extraction, evaporation, or decantation. The intermediates and final products<br>
of Formula I or Formula II may be further purified, if desired by common techniques such<br>
as recrystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all substituents are compatible with all<br>
reaction conditions. These compounds may be protected or modified at a convenient point<br>
in the synthesis by methods well known in the art.<br>
The compound of Formula I or Formula II is preferably formulated in a unit<br>
dosage form prior to administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I or<br>
Formula II and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients.<br>
The present pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by known procedures using well-<br>
known and readily available ingredients. Preferably the compound is administered orally.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in a unit dosage form. In such form, the<br>
preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities<br>
of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.<br>
The quantity of the inventive active composition in a unit dose of preparation may<br>
be generally varied or adjusted from about 0.01 milligrams to about 1,000 milligrams,<br>
preferably from about 0.01 to about 950 milligrams, more preferably from about 0.01 to<br>
about 500 milligrams, and typically from about 1 to about 250 milligrams, according to<br>
the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon<br>
the patient's age, sex, weight and severity of the condition being treated. Such techniques<br>
are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the human oral dosage form<br>
containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
Utility<br>
Compounds of Formula I or Formula II are effective as antagonists or inverse<br>
agonists of the histamine H3 receptor, and thus inhibit the activity of the H3 receptor.<br>
More particularly, these compounds are selective antagonists or inverse agonists of the<br>
histamine H3 receptor. As selective antagonists or inverse agonists, the compounds of<br>
Formula I or Formula II are useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions<br>
responsive to the inactivation of the histamine H3 receptor, including but not limited to<br>
obesity and other eating-related disorders, and cognitive disorders. It is postulated that<br>
selective antagonists or inverse agonists of H3R will raise brain histamine levels and<br>
possibly that of other monoamines resulting in inhibition of food consumption while<br>
minimizing peripheral consequences. Although a number of H3R antagonists are known<br>
in the art, none have proven to be satisfactory obesity or cognitive drugs. There is<br>
increasing evidence that histamine plays an important role in energy homeostasis.<br>
Histamine, acting as a neurotransmitter in the hypothalamus, suppressed appetite.<br>
Histamine'is an almost ubiquitous amine found in many cell types and it binds to a family<br>
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This family provides a mechanism by which<br>
histamine can elicit distinct cellular responses based on receptor distribution. Both the<br>
H1R and H2R are widely distributed. H3R is primarily expressed in the brain, notably in<br>
the thalamus and caudate nucleus. High density of expression of H3R was found in<br>
feeding center of the brain. A novel histamine receptor GPRv53 has been recently<br>
identified. GPRv53 is found in high levels in peripheral white blood cells; only low<br>
levels have been identified in the brain by some investigators while others cannot detect it<br>
in the brain. However, any drug discovery effort initiated around H3R must consider<br>
GPRv53 as well as the other subtypes.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can readily be evaluated by using a<br>
competitive inhibition Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) based on a H3R binding assay<br>
using [3H] a methylhistamine as ligand. Stable cell lines, including but not limited to<br>
HEK can be transfected with cDNA coding for H3R to prepare membranes used for the<br>
binding assay. The technique is illustrated below (Preparation of Histamine Receptor<br>
Subtype Membranes) for the histamine receptor subtypes.<br>
Membranes isolated as described in (Preparation of Histamine Receptor Subtype<br>
Membranes) were used in a [35S]GTPxS functional assay. Binding of [35S]GTPxS to<br>
membranes indicates agonist activity. Compounds of the invention of Formula I or<br>
Formula II were tested for their ability to inhibit binding in the presence of agonists.<br>
Alternately, the same transfected cell lines were used for a cAMP assay wherein H3R<br>
agonists inhibited forskolin-activated synthesis of cAMP. Compounds of Formula I or<br>
Formula II were lestcd for their ability to permit forskolin -stimulated cAMP synthesis in<br>
the presence of agonist.<br>
