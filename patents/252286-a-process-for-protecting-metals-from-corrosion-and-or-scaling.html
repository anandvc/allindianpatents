				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to a process for protecting metals from corrosion and/or<br>
scaling and particularly to a coating material for protecting metals, especially steel, from<br>
corrosion and/or scaling, and to a method for coating metals and to a metal element.<br>
Load-bearing steel components such as body parts in the automotive industry are<br>
often manufactured from high-strength heat-treated steels. This involves converting the<br>
steel into its austenitic form by annealing it at temperatures above 800-900 °C, hot-<br>
forming the steel and subsequently cooling it again at a sufficiently high cooling speed<br>
in order to produce a high-strength, martensitic microstructure. If cooling, and thus<br>
hardening takes place in the forming tool, one speaks of press hardening. This method<br>
permits the production of high-strength components. To manufacture larger components<br>
and components with complex geometries, increasing use is being made of a two-stage<br>
forming process involving pre-forming at room temperature (cold forming) followed by<br>
hot forming (press hardening) of the pre-drawn part. A general problem encountered<br>
with hot forming is scaling of the steel surface.<br>
The term scaling refers to the oxidation of metals by direct reaction with<br>
atmospheric oxygen at elevated temperatures. The layer of scale that forms on the steel<br>
surface is hard and brittle, and especially during cooling, it flakes off the parent material<br>
in clod-like pieces.<br>
The layer of scale damages both the components and the forming tools, which<br>
have to be cleaned after each forming step in order to remove flakes of scale. Press<br>
hardening of components in the numbers required for series production is thus<br>
extremely difficult if the sheet metal used is not protected. Moreover, if satisfactory<br>
corrosion protection is to be achieved, the scale has to be sandblasted off the<br>
components before they are processed further, since it is an unsuitable basis for<br>
subsequent processes such as phosphatizing and cataphoretic dip coating.<br>
Anticorrosive coatings for steel are known from the prior art. Metal coatings of<br>
aluminium or aluminium alloys, or of zinc or zinc alloys, can be deposited on the steel<br>
by hot-dip or electroplating processes.<br><br>
In the application EP 1 013 785 Al, the coating of hot-rollejd sheet with a metal or a metal<br>
alloy is described. The coating in this case is a layer of aluminium or of an alloy of<br>
aluminium, iron and silicon, said layer being applied by hot-dip coating (hot-dip aluminizing).<br>
A protective layer of this kind admittedly offers effective protection against scaling during the<br>
process of heating to austenitizing temperature. However, when used in practice for press-<br>
hardening operations, it has limitations. These are particularly noticeable during the shaping<br>
of parts with complex geometries. It is mentioned in the DE 102 46 614 Al that during the<br>
hot-dip process described in the EP 1 013 785 Al, an intermetallic alloy phase would form<br>
between the steel and the actual coating already during the coating process, and that this<br>
intermetallic alloy phase would be hard and brittle and would crack during cold deformation.<br>
The microcracks formed would cause the coating to detach from the parent material and thus<br>
lose its protective function. From this description and from practical experience in the<br>
forming of steel slugs or steel components, it is evident that hot-dip aluminizing is unsuitable<br>
for cold forming and thus also unsuitable for a two-step cold- and hot-forming process. In the<br>
DE 102 46 614 Al, it is suggested that these problems can be overcome by applying a<br>
protective metallic coating from an organic, non-aqueous solution using an electroplating<br>
method. The intention here is to deposit layers of aluminium or an aluminium alloy, or of zinc<br>
or a zinc alloy. However, the electrodeposition of aluminium on steel is a very time-<br>
consuming and expensive process.<br>
Where zinc and zinc alloys are used instead, hot-forming applications, too, are severely<br>
limited, because on heating up, most of the zinc oxidizes, or, if a protective gas is being used,<br>
vaporizes.<br>
The applications WO 2005/021820 Al, WO 2005/021821 Al and WO 2005/021822 Al<br>
describe methods of manufacturing various hardened steel parts. In each case, a protective<br>
coating consisting of zinc combined with another element that has an affinity for oxygen<br>
(especially aluminium) is applied to the steel. In the WO 2005/021821 Al, this protective<br>
coating is applied by means of a hot-dip process, in the WO 2005/021820 Al and WO<br>
2005/021822 Al by means of a hot-dip or an electroplating process. However, a common<br>
feature of all coatings described here that contain zinc as the main element, is that they are<br>
very susceptible to oxidation and vaporization at the austenitizing temperatures required for a<br><br>
press-hardening process, and that even traces of dirt (e.g. dust) on the surface will burn and<br>
lead to rejection of the part.<br>
From the DE 100 39 404 Al, a method of producing pigment- or filler-containing<br>
polysiloxane-based compositions by the sol-gel process is known. In a first step of this<br>
process, organosilanes (alkoxysilanes) containing epoxy groups are hydrolysed to a sol, and in<br>
a second step, the sol is converted into a gel. The pigments or fillers used have a mean particle<br>
diameter of at least 500 nm. The composition may include an aromatic polyol with a<br>
maximum average molecular weight of 1,000.<br>
The DE 199 40 857 Al describes a sol-gel coating material for substrates, especially<br>
automobile bodies, painted with a single-coat or multicoat paint system. The intended purpose<br>
of the sol-gel coating material is to permit the application, in as short a time as possible, of a<br>
scratch-resistant coating atop already-cured paint systems without the occurrence of adhesion<br>
problems. To this end, a siloxane-containing coating formulation is modified with organic<br>
components. The main constituents of the sol-gel coating material are an acrylate copolymer<br>
solution and a sol.	<br>
The DE 198 13 709 Al describes a method of protecting a metallic substrate from corrosion<br>
by applying to the substrate a coating composition based on (hetero)polysiloxanes prepared<br>
by hydrolysis and condensation processes, and curing said coating composition. The coating<br>
composition includes at least one species Z, which reacts, or interacts, with the metal to form<br>
a species Y, which has a more negative enthalpy of formation than the species X. The coating<br>
composition can be applied by means of a wet-chemical process. The coating is not described<br>
as being suitable for welding, let alone spot-welding.<br>
The DE 101 49 148 Al describes a method of coating metallic surfaces with an aqueous<br>
composition that contains at least one organic film former, at least one inorganic compound in<br>
particle form and at least one lubricant. The composition described in the DE 101 61 383 A1<br>
contains, in addition to the organic film former, cations and/or hexafluoro complexes of<br>
cations and at least one inorganic compound in particle form.<br>
The DE 101 41 687 Al describes an agent that contains silicon compounds and that is used<br>
primarily for producing coatings on surfaces and as a raw material for paints. The agent is a<br><br>
reactive mixture containing at least one alyltrialkoxysilane, at least one alkoxysilane and/or at<br>
least one tetraalkoxysilane, at least one hydrous silicic-acid sol, at least one acid and at least<br>
one alcohol or at least one glycol.<br>
The DE 100 27 265 Al describes aluminium coils coated with coloured or effect-forming<br>
multilayer coatings. On at least one of their surfaces, the coils have a combination-effect<br>
coating consisting of a pigmented powder slurry, a clear lacquer and a sealer based on<br>
organically modified ceramic materials.<br>
The EP 0 610 831 A2 describes a method of producing functional coatings using<br>
organofunctional silanes, a metal compound and low-volatility oxides. The method involves<br>
carrying out a hydrolytic condensation, adding an organic, cross-linkable prepolymer to the<br>
hydrolytic condensate, applying the coating solution thus obtained to a substrate and<br>
subsequently curing it.<br>
The WO 95/13326 Al describes a method of producing compositions based on hydrolysable<br>
silanes containing epoxy groups, in which a particulate material, a preferably non-ionic<br>
surfactant or an aromatic polyol is added to a pre-hydrolysed silicon compound in order to<br>
i<br>
obtain highly scratch-resistant coatings with lasting hydrophilic properties, anticorrosive<br>
properties, good adhesion and high transparency.<br>
In the field of anticorrosive coatings applied by wet-chemical methods, protective organic<br>
coatings, for example, are known. Some of them are protective enamels filled with zinc<br>
pigments. Preferably in the form of an additional sealing layer on an electrogalvanized or hot-<br>
dip galvanized steel surface, these offer good corrosion protection for low-temperature<br>
applications. However, on account of their insufficient thermal stability, they cannot be used<br>
for hot-forming and press-hardening processes involving temperatures above 800 °C. The<br>
same applies to a large number of organic-based or sol-gel-bajsed anticorrosive coatings.<br>
At the present time, there are no coating materials known from the prior art that are suitable<br>
for wet-chemical application, protect the steel from corrosion and/or scaling, and are still<br>
suitable for welding following heat treatment of the coated steel at temperatures above 600<br>
°C. This suitability for welding particularly includes the suitability of a coated and<br>
subsequently heat-treated steel part for spot welding, for which process the<br><br>
or hot-dip galvanized steel surface, these offer good corrosion! protection for low-temperature<br>
applications. However, on account of their insufficient thermal stability, they cannot be used<br>
for hot-forming and press-hardening processes involving temperatures above 800 °C. The<br>
same applies to a large number of organic-based or sol-gel-based anticorrosive coatings.<br>
At the present time, there are no coating materials known from the prior art that are suitable<br>
for wet-chemical application, protect the steel from corrosion and/or scaling, and are still<br>
suitable for welding following heat treatment of the coated steel at temperatures above 600<br>
°C. This suitability for welding particularly includes the suitability of a coated and<br>
subsequently heat-treated steel part for spot welding, for which process the<br>
coating/component composite requires a sufficiently high electrical conductivity even after<br>
the aforementioned heat treatment.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to provide a coating material that can still be welded, in<br>
particular spot welded, following heat treatment of the coated steel.<br>
This object is established according to the invention in that, to make the applied coating<br>
material suitable for welding, especially for spot welding, a readily oxidizable organic or<br>
inorganic/organic binder containing readily oxidizable organic components is combined with<br>
an electrically conducting metallic or non-metallic filler, that the coating material can be<br>
applied by wet-chemical methods, that the coating material undergoes a change in structure<br>
when subjected to high-temperature processes involving temperatures of more than 600 °C,<br>
and that the coating material is a suitable primer for additional coating materials.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that it is by all means possible to provide a coating material that<br>
can be applied by wet-chemical methods, that offers good protection against scaling and that<br>
is also suitable for welding, especially for spot welding.<br><br>
Compared with prior-art coatings that cannot be applied by wet-chemical methods, the<br>
coatings of the invention also offer the following advantages; the coatings have a very wide<br>
range of uses, as in addition to the coil coating technique they can be applied by other<br>
methods such as curtain coating, spray painting, dip-coating, flooding, etc., and can thus be<br>
used on three-dimensional components as well as on coils and slugs. The coatings are<br>
multifunctional, i.e. in addition to their principal function of protecting against corrosion<br>
and/or scale, they can also incorporate tribologically active constituents that enable them to<br>
develop a lubricating effect during cold- and hot-forming, thus making external lubricants<br><br>
unnecessary. A further advantage is that the coatings can be applied in very thin layer<br>
thicknesses (in the lower urn range), which improves the electrical conductivity and brings<br>
material and cost savings. If, following the hot-forming process, even higher electrical<br>
conductivity is desired, a thin, electrically conducting primer may be applied atop the coating.<br>
Following the forming process, or high-temperature forming process, the coating material<br>
may remain on the surface of the substrate, where it may perform additional functions, e.g.<br>
increase the scratch resistance, improve the corrosion protection, fulfil aesthetic aspects<br>
(addition of colour, anti-fingerprint properties), protect against tarnishing (in the case of metal<br>
or PVD surfaces), alter the electrical conductivity (antistatic effect, insulating effect) and<br>
maybe serve as a primer for customary downstream processes (e.g. phosphatizing and<br>
cataphoretic dip coating).<br>
Another embodiment of the invention consists in that, to make the applied coating material<br>
suitable for welding, an organic, inorganic or organic-inorganic binder matrix contains<br>
compounds which, on being heated under reducing conditions at temperatures above 840 °C,<br>
form a conducting phase, in particular metal salts, metal alkoxides, carbides and phosphides<br>
of iron, copper, tungsten and aluminium, and electrically conducting oxides, in particular<br>
antimony-tin oxide (ATO) and indium-tin oxide (1TO).<br>
The metal salts are preferably salts of subgroup metals.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention consists in that, to make the coating suitable for<br>
welding, the coating material contains electrically conducting compounds that are resistant to<br>
oxidation processes at high temperatures, in particular special-steel pigments, pigments or<br><br>
powders of noble metals, copper, tin, graphite and soot,j and high-temperature-resistant<br>
semiconductors such as silicon carbide.<br>
The coatings' suitability for welding is ensured by the selective addition of electrically<br>
conducting compounds that are resistant to oxidation processes at high temperatures and<br>
accordingly possess the required electrical conductivity for spot welding both before and<br>
during the curing process.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention consists in that the electrically conducting substances<br>
that are resistant to oxidation processes when reducing conditions prevail in the coating are<br>
selected from pigments and powders of iron, aluminium, zinc, magnesium, graphite and soot.<br>
The above-mentioned reducing conditions may be induced in the coating particularly by the<br>
binder.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that the coating material contains between 5 und 95 %<br>
by weight, preferably between 10 and 75 % by weight, of binder and between 0 and 90 % by<br>
weight, preferably 25 to 75 % by weight, of pigments and/or fillers.<br>
According to the invention, the binder contains organic compounds, especially polyurethanes,<br>
polyesters, epoxy resins, alkyd resins, phenolic resins, melamin resins, acrylates and<br>
methacrylates, organic-inorganic compounds, especially oligo- and polysiloxanes from the<br>
hydrolysis and condensation of alkylalkoxysilanes, alkoxysilanes or mixtures thereof, or<br>
silicones, silicone resins or organically modified silicone resins, or purely inorganic<br>
compounds, especially silicates, polyphosphates and aluminosilicates, or metals, metal<br>
alkoxides and their condensation products, metal oxides and metal salts.<br>
It is also to advantage that the coating material contains metal pigments, in particular<br>
aluminium, zinc, iron, tin, copper, magnesium, high-grade steel, silver or other noble metals<br>
or metal salts.<br>
These serve to improve corrosion protection and/or to prevent high-temperature corrosion<br>
(scale formation).<br><br>
It may also be expedient that the coating material contains lubricants, in particular natural and<br>
synthetic waxes, oils, polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and fluoroethylenepropylene,<br>
thermoplastics, especially polyethylene and polyamide, stearates, soaps of aluminium, zinc,<br>
magnesium and lithium, higher fatty acids, organic compounds of chlorine, phosphorus and<br>
sulphur, fluorides of calcium or barium, phosphates, oxides, hydroxides and sulphides of<br>
calcium and zinc, and metals, in particular lead, copper, tin, silver, gold, indium and nickel.<br>
It is also within the scope of the invention that the coating material contains greases, in<br>
particular inorganic greases, preferably graphite, soot, boron nitride, titanium nitride,<br>
molybdenum disulphide and tungsten disulphide.<br>
These greases are particularly suitable for processes carried out at higher temperatures.<br>
The invention furthermore provides for the coating material to contain one or more<br>
anticorrosive pigments or corrosion inhibitors, in particular silicates, polyphosphates, tannin<br>
derivatives, alkaline sulphonates of alkali and alkaline earth metals, zinc salts of organic<br>
nitrogen acids, and phosphates, chromates and molybdates of calcium, magnesium, zinc or<br>
aluminium.<br>
The anticorrosion properties are improved in this way.<br>
According to the invention, the coating material is suitable for spot-welding.<br>
The scope of the invention also includes a method for coating metals, especially steel, with<br>
the coating material of the invention, the coating material being applied to a substrate by<br>
means of a wet-chemical coating process such as knife application, dip-coating, spray-<br>
painting, roller application, flooding or curtain coating, and being bonded firmly to the<br>
surface of the substrate by means of a curing stage.<br>
According to one version of the invention, curing ensues in a temperature range from room<br>
temperature up to 800 °C, preferably at temperatures from room temperature up to 300 °C.<br>
The elevated temperature is initiated by hot air, by radiation in the NIR, IR, UV range, by<br>
electron beam or by induction.<br><br>
It is possible that after ordinary drying or a curing stage of the kind described above, the<br>
coating material will show sufficient electrical conductivity to render it suitable for welding.<br>
Another version of the invention consists in that application of the coating material to the<br>
substrate is followed by a high-temperature processing stage in which the coating<br>
material/substrate composite is heated to a temperature between 840 °C and 1,300 °C,<br>
preferably between 840 °C and 1,000 °C.<br>
The thermal treatment causes a change in the chemical structure of the coating material and is<br>
usually also of technical significance for the metal, e.g. it improves the metal's workability<br>
(i.e. its forming property) by pressing, forging, etc. The thermal treatment can also be part of a<br>
hardening process that is carried out with or without forming. The outcome of the thermal<br>
treatment is that the resulting structure shows sufficient electrical conductivity to permit<br>
welding by means of standard welding techniques, especially spot welding. In addition, the<br>
coating material can be formed by means of all standard cold- and hot-forming processes.<br>
It is furthermore expedient that the high-temperature processing stage takes between one<br>
second and several hours, preferably between one second and 30 minutes.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that the metallic substrate is steel, a steel alloy or a steel<br>
provided with a metallic coating, in particular of aluminium, zinc, magnesium, tin or<br>
appropriate alloys of these metals, such as aluminium-silicon, aluminium-iron, zinc-iron,<br>
zinc-silicon and zinc-aluminium-silicon.<br>
According to the invention, coils, slugs or other components, in particular profiles, rods, wire,<br>
pipes, mouldings, forgings or castings, are used as steel substrate.<br>
Finally, the scope of the invention also includes a metal element provided with a coating<br>
material according to the invention.<br>
Examples of such metal elements particularly include automotive components (e.g. body and<br>
engine parts), components of trains and aircraft, of machines, industrial plant and agricultural<br>
equipment, and metal parts used in the construction and mining industries.<br><br>
The invention is explained in detail below by reference to three embodiments.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
10g of graphite powder (particle size 
polyester solution (e.g. in xylol, obtainable under the trade name Silikoftal) and mixed in<br>
thoroughly using a dissolver. 70 g of ethanol, 10 g of carnauba wax dispersion (solids content<br>
20 % by weight in white spirit), 50 g of aluminium pigment baste (e.g. Decomet Hochglanz,<br>
Al 1002/10, from Schlenk) and 20 g of zinc paste (e.g. Zinkflake GTT, from Eckart) are<br>
added to the mixture and stirred in homogeneously with a paddle stirrer (low shearing force)<br>
for several hours.<br>
Following appropriate dilution with butyl glycol, the finished coating material is applied to an<br>
alkaline degreased steel substrate using a paint spray gun with gravity cup (e.g. Sata Jet, 1.2<br>
mm nozzle), or, in cases of a suitable substrate geometry (flat metal sheet or slug), using a<br>
doctor knife, so that a thin, wet film of approx. 10-40 µm thickness is obtained. The coating is<br>
cured for about 10 minutes at a surface temperature of 220 °C. The coating may also be<br>
applied to the metal sheet by roller (e.g. coil coating) and stoved at a peak metal temperature<br>
(PMT)of 230-240°C.<br>
Example 2<br>
30 g of graphite powder (particle size 
polyester solution (e.g. in xylol, obtainable under the trade name Silikoftal) and mixed in<br>
thoroughly using a dissolver. 70 g of xylol, 10 g of carnauba wax dispersion (solids content<br>
20 % by weight in white spirit) and 30 g of aluminium] pigment paste (e.g. Decomet<br>
Hochglanz, Al 1002/10, from Schlenk) are added to the mixture and stirred in homogeneously<br>
with a paddle stirrer (low shearing force) for several hours.<br>
Following appropriate dilution with butyl glycol, the finished coating material is applied to a<br>
grease-free, galvanized steel substrate using a paint spray gun with gravity cup (e.g. Sata Jet,<br>
1.2 mm nozzle), or, in cases of a suitable substrate geometry (flat metal sheet or plate), using<br>
a doctor knife, so that a thin, wet film of approx. 10-40 urn thickness is obtained. The coating<br>
is cured for about 10 minutes at a surface temperature of 220 °C. The coating may also be<br><br>
applied to the galvanized steel sheet by roller (e.g. coil coating) and stoved at a peak metal<br>
temperature (PMT) of 230-240 °C.<br>
Example 3<br>
50 g of butyl alcohol and 85 g of an iron pigment paste (e.g. STAPA TA Ferricon 200, from<br>
Eckart) are added to 100 g of a 60 % silicone polyester solution (in xylol, obtainable, for<br>
example, under the trade name Silikoftal) and stirred in homogeneously with a low shearing<br>
force.<br>
The finished coating material is applied to an alkaline degreased steel substrate using a paint<br>
spray gun with gravity cup (e.g. Sata Jet, 1.4 mm nozzle), or, in cases of a suitable substrate<br>
geometry (flat metal sheet or slug), using a doctor knife, so that a thin, wet film of approx. 10-<br>
40 µm thickness is obtained. The coating is cured for about 10 minutes at a surface<br>
temperature of 250°C.<br>
Example 4<br>
250 g of a suitable solvent (e.g. Solvesso 150 aromatics mixture) are added to 100 g of a<br>
polyester resin solution (obtainable, for example, under the trade name Desmotherm VP LS<br>
2218) and stirred in homogeneously. 80 g of a platelet-like copper powder (e.g. STANDART<br>
Kupferpulver Feinschliff GTT, from Eckart) are added to the diluted polyester resin and<br>
stirred in homogeneously with a paddle stirrer (low shearing force). 10 g of graphite powder<br>
(particle size 
in white spirit) are added to the mixture and mixed in thoroughly.<br>
The finished coating material is applied to an alkaline degreased steel substrate using a paint<br>
spray gun with gravity cup (e.g. Sata Jet, 1.4 mm nozzle), or, in cases of a suitable substrate<br>
geometry (flat metal sheet or slug), using a doctor knife, so that a thin, wet film of approx. 10-<br>
40 µm thickness is obtained. The coating is cured for about 10 minutes at a surface<br>
temperature of 180 °C. The coating may also be applied to the metal sheet by roller (e.g. coil<br>
coating) and stoved at a peak metal temperature (PMT) of 230-240 °C.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	Process for protecting metals from corrosion and/or scaling, characterized in that<br>
the coating material is applied to a substrate by means of a wet-chemical coating<br>
