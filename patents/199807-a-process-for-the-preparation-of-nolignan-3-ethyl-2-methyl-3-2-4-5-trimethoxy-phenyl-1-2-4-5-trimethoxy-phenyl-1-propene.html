				<td>The present invention relates to " neolignan: 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2,4,5-trimethoxy) phenyl-1 -propene" in which 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (a dihydro product of asarone obtained via hydrogenation of ß-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil) of the formula (I), undergoes dimcrisation in a single step towards formation of neolignan 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l propene (named as NEOLASA-I) of the formula II along with biologically active a-asarone and 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxy )phenyl-l-propanone as side products, thereof Further, neolignan (NEOLASA-I) is hydrogenated to obtain its corresponding dihydro product 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy) phenylpropane (named as NEONLASA-II) so as to confirm the structure as well as to determine the position of double bond existing in the above parent neolignan (NEOLASA-I) which may additionally serve as a simple synthon towards preparation of naturally occurring rare neolignans (such as acoradin or magnosalin or heterotropan and phenyl indane derivative) and their analogues in sufficient quantity to have opportunity for a wide range of biological activities including antifungal, antioxidant, antiinflammatory, neuroleptic, antihepatoxic, anticancer, anti-HIV and anti-PAF activities known for structurally similar neolignan derivatives (such as aurein or hexestrol or nordihydroguaiaretic acid derivatives etc.). In the present invention, the neolignan (NEOLASA-I) formation is the first example of DDQ assisted one step synthesis of neolignan, a dimer of phenylpropanoid, in good yield (32%) from 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane derivative.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Neolignans and lignans are known for their wide range of biological activities including hapatoprotective, harmone blocking, antibacterial, antifungal, plant growth regulator, anti-HIV, anticancer and antioxidant activities (Macrae, W.D. and Towers, G.H.N., Phytochemistry, 23 (6), 1207-1220 (1984); Ward, R.S., Tetrahedron, 46 (15), 5029-5041 (1990); Charlton, J.L., J. Nat. Prod., 61, 1447-1451 (1998); Alves, C.N.; Barroso, L.P.; Santos, L.S. and Jardim, I.N, J. Braz. Chem. Soc, 9(6), 577-582 (1998); Juhasz, L.; Dinya, Z.; Antus, S. and Gunda, T.E., Tetrahedron Letters, 41, 2491-2494 (2000); Tanaka, T.; Konno, Y.; Kuraishi, Y.; Kimura, I.; Suzuki, T. and Kiniwa, M., Biorg. &amp; Med. Chem. Letts., 12, 623-627 (2002); US patent nos. 6,294,574; 6,201,016; 5.856,323; 5,639,782; 5,530,141; 4,704,462; 4,619,943 and 4,540,709; JP Patent no. 4082837; WO Patent no. 09215294 and EP Patent No. 159565)). Neolignans and lignans are a large group of natural products characterized by the coupling of two C6-C3 units which are derived from cinnamic acid derivatives, however, both are present in traces in plants (Rao, K.V. and Rao, N.S.P., J. Nat. Prod., 53(1), 212-215 (1990) and Filler, F.; Bail, J.C.L.; Duroux, J.L.; Simon, A. and Chulia, A.J., Planta Medica, 67, 700-704 (2001)). For nomenclature purposes, the C6-C3 unit is treated as propylbenzene and numbered from 1 to 6 in the benzene ring from 7 to 9 (or a to y) starting from propyl group. With the second C6-C3 unit the numbers are primed. When the two C6-C3 vmits are linked by a bond between positions 8 and 8" (or ß and ß"), the compound is referred as a lignan. In the absence of the C-8 to C-8" (or ß and ß") bond, and where the two C6-C3 units are linked by a carbon-carbon bond, compound is referred to as neolignan. Dimers with linkages other than this type are known as cycloneolignan, epoxyneolignan and oxyneolignan etc. Similarly, the presence of a double bond (or triple bond) in the side chain (i.e. C-7 to C-9 or C-7 to C-9) of the lignan, neolignan or epoxyneolignan skeleton is indicated by changing the -ane ending to -ene (or -yne) with a locant to<br>
indicate the position of the double bond (Moss, G.P. Pure Appl. Chem., 72 (8), 1493-1523 (2000)). The basic ring system of these neolignans and lignans can be deduced by dimerization of allyl and p-propenylphenols (such as isoeugenol, coniferyl or sinapyl alcohol). Oxidation of phenols often yields phenoxy radicals, which couple with little selectivity. Both C-C and C-O bonds are formed, mainly in ortho- and para- positions to the phenolic hydroxyl. Synthetically useful reactions are obtained only when the reactivity is blocked by substituents in the aforementioned positions. For instance from 2,6- or 2,4-substituted phenols, C-C bonded biphenyls can be obtained in good yields, In other cases coupling can be directed by carrying out the reaction intramolecularly, ring closure being an effective way of inducing regioselectivity (Whitting, D.A. Oxidative Coupling of Phenols and Phenol Ethers, In Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Trost, B. M.; Fleming, I.; Pattenden, G., Eds.; Pergemon: Oxford, Vol. 3, 659-703 (1991)). Similarly, oxidation of a mixture of two phenols can lead to a mixture of dimers of the individual phenols and cross-coupling products between the different phenols. When one phenol reacts much faster than the other, for instance if it has a lower oxidation potential, it tends to dimerize without formation of significant amoxmts of cross-coupling products (Syrjanen, K. and Brunow, G., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans 1, 3425-3429 (1998)). One approach to this problem is to start with the less reactive phenol in large excess, and continuously add the more reactive phenol (and the oxidant) at a rate which is slow enough to keep its concentration too low for significant dimerisation. But this method is cumbersome and leads to a large reaction volumes, and is also difficult to reproduce. A wide range of oxidants such as K3Fe(CN)6, H2O2, FeCls, VOF3, thallium (III) tristrifluoacetate, horseradish peroxidase, iodobenzene diacetate (Frank, B. and Schlingloff, G., Liebig. Ann. Chem., 659, 132 (1962); Taylor, W.I. and Battersby, A.R. In "Oxidative Couplings of Phenols", Marcel Dekker, New York (1967); Kametani, T. and Fukumoto, K., Synthesis, 657 (1972); Taylor, E.C.; Andrade, J.G.; Rall, G.J.H. and McKillop, A., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 93, 4841 (1971); Kaisa, S. and Gosta, B., Tetrahedron, 57, 365-370 (2001); Juhaasz, L.; Kurti, L. and Antus, S., J. Nat. Prod, 63, 866-870 (2000)) and many others have been used for oxidative coupling but generally these reagents gave poor yield, and often complex mixtures. Indeed, phenoxy radical or phenoxonium ion intermediate is most common for synthesis of lignans and neolignans but there are a few patents and papers where non-phenolic compoimds have- been used<br>
for the synthesis of lignans and neolignans (Kadota, S.; Tsubono, K. and Makino, K., Tetrahedron Letters, 28 (25), 2857-2860 (1987) and Dhal, R.; Landais, Y.; Lebrun, A.; Lenain, V. and Robin, J.P., Tetrahedron, 50 (4), 1153-1164 (1994)). For example, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (one of the most important dimer derived from resinous exudates of many plants), associated with a wide range of pharmacological activities, including the inhibition of the human papillomavirus, herpes simplex, HIV and hyperglycemic activity, has been synthesized by dimerization of non-phenolic compounds such as dimethoxypropiophenone (Perry, C.W. US Patent 3,769,350 (1975)), substituted benzylmagnesium chloride (Akio, M.; Kohei, T.; Keizo, S. and Makoto, K. Tetrahedron Letters, 21, 4017-4020 (1980)) and dimethoxyphenylacetone (Mikail, H.G. and Barbara, N.T. Tetrahedron Letters, 42, 6083-6085 (2001)). However, above methods have a number of disadvantages including special handling of reagents, maintaining temperature below zero degree, expensive reagents and overall low yield, hence, none of the synthetic methods can be scaled up for industrial exploitation. On the contrary, the present invention is free from above drawbacks and discloses one step dimerisation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (a dihydro product of asarone obtained via hydrogenation of p-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil) of the formula I (Example I) into novel neolignan 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5 "-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propene (named as NEOLASA-I) of the formula 11 (Example II). Further, neolignan (NEOLASA-I) is hydrogenated to obtain its corresponding dihydro product (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5" "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2",4",5 "-trimethoxy) phenylpropane) (named as NEONLASA-II) (Example III) so as to confirm the structure as well as to determine the position of double bond existing in the above parent neolignan (NEOLASA-I) of the formula (11) which may additionally serve as a simple synthon towards preparation of naturally occurring rare neolignans (such as acoradin or magnosalin or heterotropan and phenyl indane derivative) and their analogues in sufficient quantity to have opportunity for a wide range of biological activities (Wenkert, E.; Gottlieb, H.E.; Gottlieb, O.R.; Pereira, M.O.D.S. and Formiga, M.D., Phytochemistry, 15, 1547-1551 (1976); Kikuchi, T.; Kadota, S.; Yanada, K.; Tanaka, K.; Watanabe, K.; Yoshozaki, M.; Yokoi, T. and Shingu, T., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 31, 1112 (1983); Yamamura, S.; Niwa, M.; Nonoyama, M. and Terada, Y. Tetrahedron Letters, 4891 (1978); Kadota, S.; Tsubono, K.; Makino, K.; Takeshita, M. and Kikuchi, T., Tetrahedron Letters, 28 (25), 2857-2860 (1987);<br>
Shimomura, H.; Sashida, Y and Oohara, M., Phytochemistry, 26(5), 1513-1515 (1987); Ahn, B.T.; Lee, S.; Lee, S.B.; Lee, E.S.; Kim, J.G. and Jeong, T.S., J. Nat. Prod., 64, 1562-1564 (2001) and Filleur, F.; Le Bail, J.C; Duroux, J.L.; Simon, A. and Chulia, A.J., Planta Medica, 67, 700-704 (2001)).<br>
In fact, formation of neolignan was observed accidentally when we were<br>
interested to develop a simple and economical process for the preparation of a-asarone,<br>
a well known hypolipideamic and antiplatelet active phenylpropanoid (Hernandez, A.;<br>
Lopez, M.L.; Chamorro, G. and Mendoza, F.T., Planta Medica, 59 (2), 121-124 (1993);<br>
Garduno, L.; Salazar, M.; Salazar, S.; Morelos, M.E.; Labarrios, F.; Tamariz, J. and<br>
Chamorro, G.A., J. of Ethnopharmacology, 55 (2), 161-163, (1997) and (Janusz, P.;<br>
Bozena, L.; Alina, T.D.; Barbara, L.; Stanislaw, W.; Danuta, S.; Jacek, P.; Roman, K.;<br>
Jacek, C; Malgorzata, S. and Zdzislaw, C, J. Med. Chem., 43, 3671-3676 (2000)), via<br>
treatment of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane of the formula I with DDQ in acetic acid<br>
into l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-acetoxypropane followed by alkaline hydrolysis and its<br>
acidic dehydration to obtain a-asarone. This concept was based upon the reported<br>
method wherein treatment of benzylic compound with Hg(OAC)2/AcOH or DDQ/AcOH<br>
provided corresponding acetate derivative (Rao, K.V. and Chattopadhyay, S.K.,<br>
Tetrahedron, 43, 669 (1987) and Rao, K.V. and Rao, N.S.P., J. Nat. Prod. 53(1), 212-215<br>
(1990)). But to our surprise, the treatment of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (benzylic<br>
compound) with DDQ (1.0-1.3 moles) in the presence of acetic acid, provides mixture of<br>
unexpected products namely neolignan (32% yield), a-asarone (9% yield) and l-(2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (22% yield) (Example 11) without formation of expected<br>
1-phenyl-1-aceoxypropane derivative (Subodh, K. J. Org. Chem. 50, 3070-3073 (1985)<br>
and Ward, R.S. Tetrahedron Letters, 48 (15), 5029-5041 (1990)). The structure of<br>
neolignan	(3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-<br>
trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propene or 2,2",4,4",5-5"-hexamethoxy-7",8-neolig-7-ene), α-asarone and l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (or isoacoramone) are successfully confirmed on the basis of spectral data (Example 11). The formation of all the three products are postulated only when a part of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (C6-C3) undergoes dehydrogenation with DDQ towards formation of a-asarone while little other part of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane undergoes oxidation with DDQ for isoacoramone formation. However, neolignan formation is possible only if some part of initially formed<br>
a-asarone undergoes rearrangements with unreacted 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane and DDQ towards dimerisation. Further, detailed mechanistic studies for above products are in progress. It is worthwhile to mention that increase in the amount of DDQ (1.4-2.1 moles) in acetic acid gave once again neohgnan (NEOLASA-I) and a-asarone but 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanone in little higher yield (39%) than above (22%) (Example 11). Later on, like a-asarone, isoacoramone (2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone) is also realized as an interesting rare phenylpropanoid occurring in well known medicinal plants Acorus calamus, Piper marginatum as well as in Acorus tararinowii but only in traces (Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography, 328,179-206 (1985); Santos, B.V. de O. and Chaves, M.C. de O., Biochem. Systematics Ecology, 25, 539-541 (1999) and Jinfeng, Hu and Xiaozhang, Feng, Planta Medica, 66, 662-664 (2000).<br>
In conclusion, our invention discloses a simple and economical process for preparing novel neolignans (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-{2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propene of the formula (II) and 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenylpropane of the formula (III) along with α-asarone of formula (Ha), and isoacaromone (2,4,5-trimethoxypropiophenone) of formula (IIb), as side products thereof, starting from relatively cheaper and economical material 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane obtained via hydrogenation of ß-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil as outlined in Scheme-I. Other objectives and advantages of the present invention will be made apparent as the description progresses.<br>
Scheme-I<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenylpropene, a neolignan, from 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane which is, in fact, the hydrogenated product of toxic P-asarone isolated from commercially available Acorus calamus oil.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilize toxic p-asarone rich calamus oil of tetraploid or hexaploid varieties (distributed extensively in Asian countries), thereby, enhancing the profitable use thereof<br>
Still another object of the invention is to study the interaction of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane by varying amount of DDQ, time and temperature.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to develop easy purification process to obtain high purity of neolignan and side products.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to establish the structure of side products which finally appeared to be a naturally occurring rare phenylpropanoids namely α-asarone and l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to further establish the position of the<br>
double bond existing in the above neolignan by its reduction into corresponding dihydro<br>
neolignan	i.e.	3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-<br>
trimethoxy)phenylpropane. Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of neolignan utilizing a mild and efficient reagent 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) and 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane which is, in fact, the hydrogenated product of toxic P-asarone isolated from commercially available calamus oil. It is worthwhile to mention that the above process not only led to novel neolignan (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2 " ,4 ", 5" "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2" ,4", 5 "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -propene) (named as NEOLASA-I) but also provided two more products which later on were characterized as biologically active, rare, naturally occurring phenylpropanoids namely a-asarone and 1-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanone ( isoacoramone). Further, the structure of neolignan (NEOLASA-I) was established by its catalytic hydrogenation into corresponding dihydro neolignan (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenylpropane) (named as NEOLASA-II). As per literature survey, neolignans are found to be interesting dimeric product of phenylpropanoids having a wide range of activities such as antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-HIV but are present only in traces in the plant kingdom. Keeping in view its wide scope, several partial and total synthesis of neolignans have been developed but most of the methods require expensive starting materials and reagents and also proceed in multisteps with overall poor yield. Therefore, our finding and disclosure of neolignan formation during DDQ assisted oxidation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane in one step process, is a cheaper and economical method than so far reported methods, as well as, our invention is capable of forming a series of biologically active neolignan derivatives.<br>

Although the plant derived products have found widespread applications in the field of essential oils, colours and dyes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and in many others, not only because they are easily available and are cheaper but also an important reason has been the notion that they are safer than synthetic products, which may not always be true. There are several phytochemicals which beyond a certain limit, diminishes the market potential of products such as phenylpropanoids rich essential oils which get deteriorated specifically by few isomeric forms of phenylpropenes (Miller, E.C.; Swanson, A.B.; Phillips, D.H.; Fletcher, T.L.; Liem, A. and Miller, J.A., Cancer Research, 43 (3), 1124-1134 (1983); Kim; S. C; Liem; A.; Stewart; B. C. and Miller, J. A. Carcinogensis, 20 (7), 1303-1307 (1999) and Lazutka, J.R.; Mierauskiene, S. and Dedonyte, V. Food &amp; Chemical Technology, 39, 485-492 (2001)). Generally, trans-isomers (e.g. a-asarone and isoeugenol etc) are found safer for human consumption while cis/allyl-isomers (e.g. ß-asarone and saffrole) are found toxic and carcinogenic (Harbome, J. B. and Baxter, H., Phytochemical Dictionary: A Handbook of Bioactive<br>
Compounds from Plants, Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., Washington DC, 474 (1993)). As a result, the most affected oil is Acorus calamus (family: Araceae) oil in which tetraploid and hexaploid varieties (distributed extensively in Asian countries like India, Japan, Pakistan and China) contain very high percentage of cis-phenylpropene i.e. p-asarone (varying from 70 to 90 %) while diploid and triploid varieties contain limited amount of P-asarone (3 to 8%) (Stahl, E. and Keller, K., Planta Medica 43, 128-140 (1981); Waltraud, G. and Schimmer, O., Mutation Research 121, 191-194 (1983); Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography, 328, 179-206 (1985); Motley, T.J., Economic Botany, 48, 397-412 (1994)).<br>
P-asarone is experimentally proved to be carcinogenic in animals and has also been found to induce tumors in the duodenal region after oral administration, In addition, p-asarone has also shown chromosome damaging effect on human lymphocytes in-vitro after metabolic activation (Taylor, J. M.; Jones, W. I.; Hogan, E. C; Grross, M. A.; David, D. A. and Cook, E. L., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 10, 405 (1967); Keller, K.; Odenthal, K. P. and Leng, P. E., Planta Medica 1, 6-9 (1985); Abel, G., Planta Medica, 53(3), 251-253 (1987) and Riaz, M.; Shadab, Q.; Chaudhary, F. M., Hamdard Medicus, 38(2), 50-62 (1995)). As a result, the calamus oil of Asian origin is internationally banned for any kind of use in flavor, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in which toxic P-asarone of calamus oil is utilized for its value addition except very recently by our group (Sinha, A.K.; Dogra, R. and Joshi, B.P., Ind. J. Chem., 41B, (2002) (in press); Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P. and Dogra, R., Nat. Prod. Lett., 15(6), 439-444 (2001); Sinha, A.K.; Acharya, R. and Joshi, B.P., J. Nat. Prod. (2002) (in press), Sinha, A.K.; Dogra, R. and Joshi, B.P., Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P., and Dogra, JP Patent No. 2001.68716 filed on 12 March (2001); Sinha, A.K.; Joshi, B.P., and Dogra,US Patent No. 09-805,832 filed on 14 March (2001) and US Patent No. 09-823,123 filed on 31 March (2001)) wherein ammonium formate/palladium-on-charcoal or H2/palladium-on-charcoal assisted reduction of crude calamus oil containing high percentage of toxic p-asarone provides 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (dihydro asarone) of the formula I in 97% purity with yield ranging from 81-87% based on asarones content in calamus oil. Thus, obtained 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (or l-Propyl-2,4,5-trimethoxybenzene) is tested for the first time as five times less toxic than ß-asarone and thus, this 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane<br>
enables its application in the products such as mouthwashes, tooth pastes, antiseptic soap products, chewing gum flavors and little in spicy products due to its sweet, ylang, slightly spicy and fruity aroma. In addition, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane is also discovered as a simple and an economical starting material for synthesis of a salicylamide based antipsychotic drug (5,6-dimethoxy-N[(l-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-3-propylsalicylamide) (Thomas, H.; Stefan, B.; Tomas, D.P.; Lars, J.; Peter, S.; Hakan, H. and Orgen, S. O., J. Med. Chem., 33, 1155-1163 (1990) and Sinha, A.K., US Patent No. 09-652376 filed on 31 August (2000)). In the present invention, we have extended the scope of further exploitation of 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane of the formula I as simple and economical starting material towards the formation of novel neolignan (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2 ",4 ",5" "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2 ",4 ",5 "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -propene) (named as NEOLASA-I) of the formula EI and its dihydro derivative (3-ethyl-2-methyl-3 -(2 " ,4 " ,5" "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2" ,4", 5 "-trimethoxy)phenylpropane) (named as NEONLASA-II) of the formula III and side products a-asarone of the formula Ha and l-2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propanone (isoacoramone) of the formula IIb thereof which are, in fact, biologically active rarer phenylpropanoids.<br>
Keeping in view, the toxicity problem of widely available p-asarone rich Acorus calamus oil, our initial attempt was to utilize p-asarone as a simple and cheaper starting material for the synthesis of pharmacologically active a-asarone via dihydro product of p-asarone i.e. 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane. With this objective, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane was treated with mercuric acetate or DDQ in acetic acid to provide intermediate l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-acetoxypropane followed by alkaline hydrolysis and acidic dehydration towards formation of a-asarone (Wang, Z.; Jiang, L. and Xingxiang, X., Youji Huaxue, 10 (4), 350-352 (1990); Shirokova, E.A.; Segal, G.M. and Torgov, I.V., Bioorg. Khim., 11 (2), 270-275 (1985) and Janusz, P.; Bozena, L.; Alina, T.D.; Barbara, L.; Stanislaw, W.; Danuta, S.; Jacek, P.; Roman, K.; Jacek, C; Malgorzata, S. and Zdzislaw, C, J. Med. Chem., 43, 3671-3676 (2000)). Treatment of benzylic compounds such as 8,9,10,1 l-tetrahydrodibenz(a,h)acridine and stegane with mercuric acetate/ acetic acid or DDQ/ acetic acid is well documented in literature towards formation of corresponding acetate (Subodh, K., J. Org. Chem., 50, 3070-3073 (1985) and Ward, R.S., Tetrahedron Letters, 48 (15), 5029-5041 (1990)). However, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (benzylicalkane) failed to produce any kind of product<br>
with mercuric acetate/acetic acid under the above analogue reaction condition, Interestingly, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane/DDQ/AcOH also failed to produce expected l-(2,4,5-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-acetoxypropane, but, it provided a mixture of interesting products which were easily purified on column chromatography and identified as a-asarone of the formula Ha, l-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanone (isoacoramone) of the formula Ob and novel neolignan of the formula 11 as a crystalline solid having three different mp 44-45 0C, 109-110 0C and 96-97 0C respectively. The structure of α-asarone (mp 44-45 0C) was assigned and identified on the basis of spectral data (Example 11). Similarly, structure of crystalline solid having mp 109-110 0C was confirmed on the basis of spectra] data in which IR absorption band appeared at 1658 (conjugated C=O) cm"" and also gave a positive 2,4-DNP test, thus, confirming the presence of carbonyl group. 1H NMR showed the 16 number of protons (Example II) which is less by two number of protons in comparison to starting material 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (Example I) except for a triplet signal at 5 1.18 (3H, t, J=6.9 Hz) and quartet signal at 2.99 (2H, q, J=6.9 Hz) which could be assigned to a methylene proton coupled with a methyl group proton which is overall indicative of ethyl group. Further, the position of two aromatic singlet protons and three singlet for nine protons from trimethoxy groups are more or less at same 6 value as starting material, however, appearance of ethyl protons at 5 1.18 (2H, t), 2.99 (3H, q) and carbonyl group (1658 cm-1) finally supported the possibility of ethylketone (-CO-CH2-CH3) attached to trimethoxy substituted phenyl ring. Similarly, the 13C NMR and DEPT spectral data further supported the presence of ethyl group (δc 8.4 CH3; δc 36.9 CH2) and the ketonic carbonyl (δc 200.5) linked directly to the benzene ring (Example HI). The EI mass spectrum showed a clear [M]+ peak at m/z 224 along with base peak at m/z 195 (M"+-29) which was in agreement with the presence of an ethyl moiety and this together with above 1H, 13C and IR data, the crystalline solid (mp 109-110 0C) was finally confirmed to be l-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-l-propanone (also known as isoacoramone) which is later on discovered as a naturally occurring rarer phenylpropanoid., isolated from Piper marginatum and Acorus tatarinowii as a light yellowish viscous gum in traces, however, our method afforded isoacoramone as a crystalline solid (mp 109-110 °C) (Example II) with the similar spectral data as natural isoacoramone (Jinfeng, Hu and Xiaozhang, Feng, Planta     Medica,      66,      662-664      (2000)).      Thus,      preparation      of     2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxypropiophenone (isoacoramone) in sufficient quantity has allowed to facilitate<br>
its more rigorous biological evaluation known for structurally similar propiophenone<br>
derivatives (Kuchar, M.; Brunova, B.; Rejholec, V.; Roubal, Z. and Nemecek, O.,<br>

(isoacoramone) can be utilized as a simple synthon for the preparation of diarylbutane type lignan as an analogue of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA acid) which is prepared by dimerization of 4,5-dimethoxypropiophenone (Perry, C.W. US Patent 3,769,350 (1975)).<br>
In order to establish the structure of third crystalline solid having mp 96-97 0C, a comprehensive investigation of NMR spectral data recorded in two solvents (CDCl3 and DMSO-d6) for better clarity and separation of each peaks was undertaken. The electrospray (ES)-mass spectrum of crystalline solid gave molecular ion at m/e 418 (M+). The 1H NMR spectra of solid (mp 96-97 0C) showed the presence of six methoxyls indicating it to be a possible dimer of asarone like phenylindane (a unsymmetrical dimer reported from Acorus calamus) (Saxena, D.B. Phytochemistry 25 (2), 553-555 (1986)) but with change in side chain structure. It is interesting to note from the aromatic region integrated for the four protons indicating that none of aromatic proton participates in dimerisation, however, one of the aromatic proton of phenylindane (2,3-dihydro-4,5,7-trimethoxy-l-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)indene) has taken part in dimerisation. The other groups found to be an ethyl group appeared at 5 0.93 (3H, t, H-5), 1.70-1.97 (2H, m, H-4), 3.59 (1H, t, H-3), a tertiary methyl group 1.66 (3H, s, H-6) and a alkene proton on a carbon atom attached to the phenyl ring 6.48 (1H, s, H-1). The above skeleton is further supported by13C (DEPT-135°) spectra data and mass fragmentation pattern m/z: 418 (M+) (Example 11). On the basis of above spectral data and fiirther, its comparison with some known neolignans such as Magnoshinin, Magnosalin and Heterotropan (Kikuchi, T.; Kadota, S.; Yanada, K.; Tanaka, K.; Watanabe, K.; Yoshozaki, M.; Yokoi, T. and Shingu, T., Chem.

trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propene) (named as NEOLASA-I) (Example II). Further, neolignan (NEOLASA-I) is hydrogenated (Example EH) to obtain its corresponding dihydro product i.e.3 -ethyl-2-methyl-3 -(2 " ,4 " ,5" "-trimethoxy)phenyl-1 -(2" ,4" ,5 "-<br>
trimethoxy)phenylpropane (named as NEONLASA-II) so as to confirm the structure as well as to determine the position of double bond existing in the above parent neolignan (NEOLASA-I) which may additionally serve as a simple synthon towards preparation of neolignans derivatives in sufficient quantity to have opportunity for a wide range of biological activities including antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroleptic, anti-hepatotoxic, anticancer, anti-HIV and anti-PAF activities known for structurally similar neolignan derivatives. Neolignans and lignans comprise a class of natural plant products and they are found in the roots, stems, bark, fruit and seeds of many plant species. More than 200 compounds in this general class have been identified and a great diversity in the chemical assembly of the two characteristic phenylpropanoid units, as well as degree of oxidation and types of substituents is apparent. In addition, some natural lignans/neolignans are used as starting materials for the semi-synthesis of biological active compounds such as podophyllotoxin, isolated from Podophyllum species, is used for the semi-synthesis of the anticancer compounds etoposide and teniposide (Stahelin, H.F. and Wartburg, A.V., Cancer Research, 51, 5-15 (1991)). A number of chemical reviews on natural as well as synthetic neolignans and lignans are available including their biological activities. However, neolignas/lignans are found in traces in plant kingdom and for these reasons, several methods of preparation of neolignas/lignans have been developed by several chemists and some of the reported conventional methods include the following:<br>

All the above methods including patents have various limitations and none of them have been found suitable for the economical production of neolignan derivative. In seeking a simple synthesis of neolignan derivatives from a cheaper material and reagents, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (isolated from hydrogenation of commercially available Acorus calamus oil rich in asarones content) appears as a simple and economical starting material in which 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane undergoes dehydrogenation, oxidation and demerisation to afford 3-ethyl-2-methyl-3-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-(2",4",5"-trimethoxy)phenyl-l-propene (NEOLASA-I) as well as rarer phenylpropanoids namely α-asarone and isoacoramone. In the present invention, the formation of neolignan (NEOLASA-I) and its dihydro product (NEOLASA-II) are the first example of DDQ assisted one step synthesis of dimer from phenylpropane derivatives which, in fact, would offer the advantages of simplicity and directness and can be applied for large scale preparations.<br>
EXAMPLES The invention will now be described by way of example with refrence to the accompanying examples, which are provided for the purpose of illustration and are not to be constructed as being limiting on the present invention. Example 1<br>
Preparation 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (dihydro asarone): The starting material 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane is prepared by hydrogenation of either P-asarone (isolated from Acorus calamus oil) or commercially available calamus oil rich in asarones (i.e. ß and/or α,-asarone) content.<br>
(a) Hydrogenation of p-asarone into 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (dihydro asarone): P-asarone was isolated by loading the crude calamus oil (17.00 g) on silica gel column and then eluted the column with hexane to remove unwanted non-polar compounds. Subsequent elution with hexane-ethylacetate mixture with increasing proportion of ethylacetate upto 10% gave 13.94 g (82 %, w/w) of pure liquid; Rf 0.63 (hexane:toluene: ethylacetate = 1:1:0.1); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ 6.84 (1H, s, H-6), 6.53 (1H, s, H-3), 6.50 (1H, dd, J=15.8 Hz and 1.5 Hz, H-1"), 5.78 (1H, dq, J=6.5 Hz and 15.8 Hz, H-2"), 3.88, 3.83 and 3.79 (s, 3H, each, 3-OCH3) and 1.85 (3H, dd, J=6.5 Hz and 1.5 Hz, H-31); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75.4 MHz) 5 151.4 (C-2), 148.5 (C-4), 142.3 (C-5), 125.5 (C-r ), 124.7 (C-2" ), 118.0 (C-1), 114.1 (C-6), 97.6 (C-3), 56.5 , 56.2 8c 55.9 (3x OCH3) and 14.5 (C-3" ); EMS m/z 208 (M+, 100), 193 (M+- Me, 46), 165 (M+-C3H7, 24). On the basis of above spectral data and comparing with reported literature (Gonzalez, M. C; Sentandrew, M. A.; Rao, K. S.; Zafra, M. C. and Cortes, D., Phytochemistry 43,1361-1364 (1996)), the liquid was identified as P-asarone in 94% purity (by GC, performed on a Shimadzu-GC-14B gas chromatograph with the following conditions: SE-30 column; 30 m x 0.25 mm; injector 2507C; FID detector 230 7c; temp, programme 40 (hold for 2 min.) to 220°C (hold for 10 min.), 10°c min-1; vol. 1 µl; N2 flow 30ml/min; H2flow 40ml/min.; air flow 300ml/min.; split injection ratio 1:30)<br>
The p-asarone (6.00 g, 0.029 mol) in 160 ml of ethanol is stirred with 10% palladium on activated charcoal (0.80 g) and ammonium formate (17.00 g, 0.27 mol) at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere till the disappearance of starting material. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure.
