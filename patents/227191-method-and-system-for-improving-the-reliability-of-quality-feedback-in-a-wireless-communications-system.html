BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
[0001} The present invention relates generally to communications, and more specifically, to systems and techniques for enhancing the reliability of feedback in a wireless communications system.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] The ability of a receiver to detect a signal in the presence of noise is based on the ratio of the received signal power and the noise power. Various conventions have been deveioped over the years for computing this ratio. For example, the carrier-to-interference (C/l) ratio, the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR), and the energy-per-bit-to-noise plus interference ratio (Eb/lo) are just a few of many different ways to measure receiver performance. Industry usage of these tenns, or similar tenns, has often been interchangeable, and for the purposes of this disclosure, will have the same meaning. Accordingly, any reference to a C/l ratio will be understood by those skilled in the art to encompass the broad concept ot measuring the effects of noise in a wireless communications system.<br>
[0003] In multi-access communications systems, techniques to increase bandwidth are commonly employed to maximize user capacity. For example, many transmitter designs adaptively increase the data rate to maintain the lowest C/l ratio necessary to achieve a desired quality of service. This can be achieved with what is commonly referred to as an "outer loop control" which estimates the C/l ratio at the receiver and provides feedback to the transmitter to adjust the data rate. This approach works well for receivers in close proximity â–  to the transmitter. However, for those receivers operating at the edges of the .transmitter's coverage region, a high probability exists that the estimated C/l ratio fed back to the transmitter will be corrupted resulting In an artificially high<br><br>
estimate. This artificially high estimate causes the transmitter to increase the data rate of the transmission beyond the capabilities of the receiver under the existing channel conditions. The problem becomes even more pronounced in communications systems in which the transmitter only receives estimates of the C/i ratio from the receiver periodically to save on overhead. In these systems, the data rate of the transmission may exceed the capabilities of the receiver for extended periods of time.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] In one aspect of the present invention, a method of communications includes transmitting a signal over a plurality of time periods, receiving a plurality of parameters each relating to the signal transmission during a different one of the time periods, filtering a first one of the parameters to generate a first filtered parameter, filtering a second one of the parameters as a function of the first filtered parameter to generate a second filtered parameter, and controlling the signal trEuismission as a function of the second filtered parameter.<br>

The term "exemplary" used throughout this description means "serving as an example.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to those si<ill6d in the art that present invention may be practiced without these specific details. some instances well-known structures and devices are shown block diagram form order to avoid obscuring concepte of></ill6d>
[0015] FIG. 1 is a conceptual block diagram showing a base station 102 in communication with a subscriber station 104 in an exemplary wireless communications system. The subscriber station 104 may access a network (not shown), or communicate with other subscriber stations (not shown), through tlie base station 102. The base station 102 can be impiemented with a variable data rate to ensure the transmission occurs near or at the maximum data rate that supports the minimum quality of service requirements. Initially, the subscriber station 104 establishes communication with the base station 102 using a predetermined access procedure. Once communications are established, the subscriber station 104 can receive traffic and control messages from the base station 102 over a foward link, and is able to transmit traffic and control messages to the base station 102 over a reverse link. The fonward link refers to transmissions from the base station 102 to the subscriber station 104, and the reverse link refers to transmissions from the subscriber station 104 to the base station 102.<br>
[0Q16] The subscriber station 104 can provide feedback to the base station 102 over the reverse link to optimize performance. The feedback can be in the fonn of a parameter estimated at the subscriber station 104 and fed back to the base station 102 to control the forward link transmission. The parameter should<br><br>
relate to the quality of the forward Ifnk transmfssion under existing channel conditions. The carrier-to-interference (C/l) ratio, the signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR), and the energy-per-bit-to-noise plus interference ratio (Eb/lo) are common examples of such parameters. In at least one emtwdiment of the communications system, an estimate of the C/l ratio is fed back to the base station 102 to efficiently control the data rate of the forward link transmission. An estimate of the C/l ratio can be computed at the subscriber station from a pilot signal transmitted over the forward link. Since the pilot signal is known, a prion, an estimate of the C/l ratio can be computed from a locally generated replica of the pilot signal stored in memory (not shown) at the subscriber statron 104 â–  The estimated C/l ratio can then be digitally quantized and fed back to the base station 102.<br>
[0017] At the base station 102, the estimated C/l ratio can be mapped to a fonward link data rate using a look up table. The selection of the fonward link data rate can be based on a mapping function for model channel conditions. This approach works well for forward link channel conditions which track fairly well with the model channel conditions. However, should the fonvard link channel conditions be different, the data rate obtained from the table may be less than optimal. For example, if the forward link channel conditions are worse than the model channel conditions, the data rate obtained from the table may be too high resulting In significant decoding errors at the subscriber station 104, Conversely, If the forward link channel conditions are better than the model channel conditions, then the data rate obtained from the table may be too low resulting in loss of valuable bandwidth. To maintain optimal perfomiance \ despite varying channel conditions, additional feedback from the subscriber station 104 can be used to adjust the C/l estimate before it Is mapped to a data rate. The feedback can take the form of an acknowledgement (ACK) message for each data packet of the fomard link transmission that Is successfully decoded by the subscriber station 104, and a negative acknowledgement (NACK) message for each data packet of the fonvard link transmission that is not successfully decoded by the subscriber station 104. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term "data packets" will refer to both data and voice packets depending on the particular communications application.<br><br>
[0018] An exemplary waveform used for a reverse link transmission carrying an estimated C/l ratio is shown in FIG. 2. The wavefom can be partitioned into 20 millisecond (ms) frames 202 with each frame having sixteen 1.25 ms time slots 204. For ease of explanation, the estimated C/l ratio is shown having its own control channel, however, as those skilled in the art will readily appreciate, the estimated C/I ratio may be transmitted over the reverse link in any manner depending on the communications environment, applicable industry standards, and overall design constraints. For example, the estimated C/l ratio can be punctured into one or more traffic channels. Alternatively, the estimated C/l ratio can be time division multiplexed with other overhead signals such as the reverse link pilot signal. Time division multiplexing the estimated C/l ratio with the reverse link pilot signal may be advantageous in spread spectrum communications such as code division multiple access (CDMA) systems which utilize Walsh functions for channel separation. In these systems, a Walsh (Wo) code consisting of a)) zeros is typically assigned to the pilot channel to avoid modulating the pilot signal. By transmitting the estimated C/l ratio on the pilot channel, processing delays associated with demodulation can bo eliminated. Each estimated C/l ratio is typically represented by several bits. Using more bits to represent the estimated C/l ratio allows for more selectable data rates at the base station. In order to reduce overhead, an estimated C/\ ratio is generally not transmitted in every time slot. Instead, an estimated C/l ratio 206 is transmitted in just one time slot of each frame followed by an up/down bit 208 in each of the following fifteen time slots.<br>
[0019] FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram of the exemplary base station and subscriber station described in connection with FIG. 1. The subscriber station 104 typically includes an antenna 302 which couples the fonward link transmission propagated in free space to a transceiver 304. The transceiver 304 can be configured to filter and amplify the fonward link transmission, and downconvert it to a modulated baseband signal. A demodulator 306 can be used to generate soft symbol estimates from the modulated signal. The soft symbol estimates can be coupled to a decoder 308 for fonward error correction before hard symbol estimates are made downstream.    An ACK or NACK<br><br>
I<br>
message can be generated by the decoder 308 to indicate whether each data packet of soft symbol estimates has been successfully decoded.<br>
[0020] The forward link pilot signal is typically not encoded, and therefore, the soft symbol estimates generated from the pilot signal can be coupled directly from the demodulator 306 to a C/t ratio estimator 310. Since the pilot symbol sequence is known, a prion, it can be stored in memory 312 at the subscriber station 104. Based on the soft symbol estimates fnam the forward link pilot signal and the pilot symbol sequence stored in memory 312, the C/l ratio estimator 310 can compute an estimated C/l ratio and digitally quantize the result. The C/I computation can be performed by any means Itnown in the art including a mean square error (MSE) algorithm or any other applicable algorithm.<br>
[0021] An encoder 314 can be used to perform various signal processing functions on one or more traffic channels, such as convolutional encoding and interleaving. For each time slot, traffic from the encoder 314 together with the ACK or NACK message from the decoder 308 can be provided to the modulator 316. in addition, the estimated C/I ratio from the C/l ratio estimator 310 can be provided to the modulator 316 during one time slot in each frame. An up/down command can be generated by the C/l ratio estimator 310 for each of the following fifteen time slots and provided to the modulator 316. The estimated C/l ratio (or the up/down command) and ACK or NACK message can be placed on the appropriate channels and combined with the traffic channels by means well known in the art. Alternatively, one or both of the estimated C/i ratio (or the up/down command) and the ACK or NACK message can be punctured into one or more of the traffic channels. In any event, the various channels can be combined and modulated by means well known in the art and provided to the transceiver 304 for upconversion, filtering and amplification before being transmitted over the reverse link through the antenna 302.<br>
[0022] The reverse link signal can be received by an antenna 31B at the base station 102 and provided to a transceiver 320. The transceiver 320 can provide filtering and amplification of the reverse link transmission, as welt as downconversion to a modulated baseband signal.  A demodulator 322 can be<br><br>
used to demodulate the baseband signal. The demodulated signal can be provided to a decoder 324 which performs the inverse of the signal processing functions done at the subscriber station 104, specifically the de-interteaving and decoding,<br>
[0023] A processor 326 can be configured to perform numerous functions. In the exemplary communications system described thus far, the processor 326 can be used to detemiine the data rate of the forward link transmission based on the estimated C/l ratio and the up/down commands reported bacl
[0024] The processor 326 can be used to control the data rate of an encoder 328L The encoder 328 performs various signal processing functions on one or more traffic channels such as convolutional encoding at the data rate set by the processor 326 and interleaving. The traffic from the encoder 328 can be p'rovided to a modulator 33 where it is combined with other overhead channels and modulated. The modi^ted signal can be provided to tiie transceiver 320 for upconversion, filtering and amplification before being transmitted over the fonvard link through the antenna 318.<br>
[0025] FIG. 4 is a functional Islcck diagram of an exemplary processor for computing the data rate of the encoder. The estimated C/l ratio extracted from the demodulated signal can be provided to a tracker 402. The tracker 402 may include memory (not shown) tor updating the estimated C/I ratio once every frame and a trackir^g functfon for incrementing or decrementing the estimated C/l ratio stored in memory in accordance with the up/down commands received from the subscribe;' station 104 in the following fifteen time slots. The tracking function allows the estimated C/l ratio to be mapped to a data rate via a look up table 408 every tima slot.<br>
[0026] The estimated C/l ratio from the tracker 402 can be adjusted before it is mapped to a data rate. An adjuster 406 can be used to adaplivety compensate<br><br>
the estimated CA ratio for changing channel conditions by incrementing or decrementing the estimated C/l ratio in response to the ACK and NACK messages. For example, if the channel conditions become worse than the model ciiannel conditions used to generate the mapping function, the adjuster 406 may select a more conservative data rate for a given estimated C/l ratio by decrementing the estimate before providing it to the look up table 408. The selection of a more conservative data rate can be triggered by an unusually high number of NACK messages being reported back to the base station from the subscriber station. Conversely, should the channel conditions become belter than the model channel conditions of the mapping function, the adjuster 406 may select a more aggressive data rate for a given estimated C/l ratio by incrementing the estimate before providing it to the look up table 408. The selection of a more aggressive data rate can be triggered by an unusually high number of ACK messages being reported back to the base station from the subscriber station,<br>
[0027] To conserve bandwidth, the look-up table 408 typically provides a thresholding function which prevents fonvard link transmissions when the estimated C/l ratio is too low. Unfortunately, this thresholding function can sometimes shrink the geographic coverage region of the base station. As explained earlier, a subscriber station operating at the edges of the base station's coverage region has a high probability that the estimated C/l ratio will tie corrupted wtien it arrives at the base station resulting in an artificially high estimate. This artificially high estimate tends to increase the data rate of the fonward (ink transmission beyond the subscriber station's capability under the existing channel conditions resulting In an unusually high number of NACK messages being reported back to the base station. As the number of NACK messages increase, the adjuster 406 decreases the estimated C/l ratio until it falls below the threshold, in other words, corrupted C/l ratio estimates received by the base station from a subscriber station operating at the edges of the coverage region not only result in a data rate that cannot be supported by the subscriber station, but may also result in the complete loss of the forward link transmission due to an abundantly high number of NACK messages which tend<br><br>
to drive the estimated C/l ratio below the threshold needed to support a forward link transmission.<br>
[0028] To prevent the ccHnptete loss of the forward link transmission under these conditions, the adjuster 406 can be configured to control the manner in which the estimated C/l ratio is reduce in response to NACK messages. For example, the adjuster 406 can be configured to decrease the estimated C/l ratio only if the NACK message is both preceded and followed by an ACK message. In this configuration, the adjuster 406 will not respond to two or more consecutfve NACK messages, which Is characteristic of a subscriber station operating at the edges of the base station's coverage region. Of course, those skilled in the art will be readily able to devise other algorithms for manipulating the NACK messages to prevent the loss of the fonvard link transmission.<br>
[0029] A filter 404 can also be positioned in front of the adjuster 406 to prevent abrupt changes in the C/l ratio estimate from killing the fonward link transmission. The filter 404 can be implemented in a variety of ways depending on the particular communications environment, and the overall design constraints of the system, as well as other known considerations. For example, the filter 404 can implemented with an algorithm that limits the maximum change in the estimated C/l ratio from one time period to the next time period. The term "time period" is used broadly to define any period of time. The time periods can divide up a continuous transmission or define a burst transmission. Alternativaly, the time periods can divide up each burst transmission in a series of transmissions. In most cases, the time period will take on some convenient value based on the design parametars of the communications system. For example, in the exemplary communications system described thus far, the time period of the filter 404 can be conveniently set to one time slot because of the tracking function. Alternatively, the time period of the filter 404 could be set tor a portion of one time slot, multiple time slots, one frame, multiple frames, or any other convenient measure of time.<br>
[0030] The filter 404 can be implemented with various algorithms to prevent abrupt changes in the estimated C/l ratio. For example, an algorithm can be used to limit the maximum change in the estimated C/l ratio to a threshold<br><br>
value. The threshold value can be static, or alternatively, can be adaptlvely adjusted to optimize performance under changing channel conditions. An exemplary algorithm using a static threshold can be expressed as follows:<br><br>
where: X(t) is the estimated C/l ratio output from the filter for time slot t;<br>
Y(t) is the estimated C/l ratio input to the filter for time slot t;<br>
X(t'1) is the estimate C/l ratio output from the filter for the previous time slot; and<br>
T is the threshold In dB.<br>
[0031] An exemplary algorithm using an adaptive threshold can be expressed as follows:<br><br>
o(t-1) is the standard deviation of the estimated C/f ratios output from the filter computed over the N number of previous time<br><br>
slots; and<br>
a Is a constant.<br>
[0032] With this algorithm, any number N of previous filtered estimates can be used to generate a mean value. An adaptive threshold can then be set to limit the maximum change in the estimated C/l ratio from the mean to one or more multiples of the standard deviation. This approach provides an adaptive threshold that decreases if the estimated C/l ratios are tightly clustered around the mean and increases if the estimated C/l ratios are widely scattered about the mean. Of course, other algorithms may be used depending on the particular communications application and overall design constraunts. Those skilled in the art will be readily able to derive such algorithms based on the teachings of this disclosure.<br>
