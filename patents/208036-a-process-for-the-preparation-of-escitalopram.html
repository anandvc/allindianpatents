INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram. Escitalopram is one of the enantiomers of the well-known antidepressant drug citalopram which [ 1 -((3 -dimethylamino)propyl)-1 -(4' -fluorophenyl)-1,3 -dihydro-5-isobenzofuran-carbonitrile] has the formula-I given below:<br><br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of an intermediate useful for the preparation of escitalopram.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug available in the market for some years. It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, is accordingly having the antidepressant activity. The antidepressant activity of citalopram has been reported in several publications, e.g. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychophannacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 1982, 6,277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75,478-486.<br>
The process for the preparation of antidepressant citalopram and its pharmaceutoical properties were first disclosed in DE Patent no. 2,657,013 (1977) corresponding to US Patent no. 4,136,193 (1979). Subsequently it was also disclosed in GB patent no.1,526,331 (1978).<br><br>
The basic process for the preparation of citalopram described in the above-referred patents involves two major routes illustrated in Scheme-1 and Scheme-2. Major difference in these two routes is introduction of dimethylaminopropyl side chain at an early stage (Scheme-1) or at a later stage (Scheme- 2).<br>
In the first route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-II is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get a benzophenone derivative of the formula-Ill. This benzophenone derivative is reacted with 3-(dimethylamino)prdpylmagnesium chloride to get the dihydroxy intermediate of the formula-FV.<br><br><br>
Cyclization of the compound of the formula-IV with an acid catalyst resulted in the formation of phthalane derivative of the formula-V. This bromophthalane derivative is reacted with copper (I) cyanide to get the citalopram base of the formula-I.<br>
In the second route, 5-bromophthalide of the formula-II is reacted with p-fluorophenyl-magnesium bromide to get the corresponding benzophenone derivative of the formula-Ill.<br><br><br>
This compound of the formula-Ill is reduced with lithium aluminum hydride to get the dihydroxy compound of the formula-VI, which is cyclized with an acid catalyst to get the phthalane derivative of the formula-VII. The bromo group is replaced with a cyano group and alkylated with the required side chain to get the citalopram base of the formula-I.<br>
Another method for the preparation of citalopram base of the formula-I and an intermediate useful for the preparation of citalopram was described in U S. Pat. No. 4,650,884, according to which 5-cyanophthalide of formula-IX is reacted successively with p-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide and 3-(dimethylamino)propylmagnesium chloride to get the compound of the formula-XI which is reacted with 70% sulfuric acid to get the citalopram base (Scheme-3).<br><br>
Process for the preparation of escitalopram is disclosed in U. S. Pat. No. 4,943,590. According to this patent, attempts to crystallize the diastereomeric salts of citalopram enantiomers have failed. In this patent a process for the preparation of escitalopram was described by resolving the intermediate (compound of the formula-XI) of citalopram and<br><br><br>
The main drawback in this process is the purity of the intermediate compound of the formula-XI obtained in the Grignard reaction, which is of 80-90% only. The crude compound of formula-XI needs extensive purification before proceeding for resolution. The purification technique given in the above patent process involves repeated charcoal and silica gel treatment to the compound of the formula-XI or its HBr salt. Also, during the HBr salt formation of compound of the formula-XI, the amount of HBr used in the process should be less than the molar quantity to avoid additional impurities formation. As the impurities present in the intermediate compoimd of the formula-XI have closely related properties such a purification technique is not viable on a commercial scale to make this intermediate and also the escitalopram. Also, the overall yield of escitalopram given in this patent is only 8.8% starting from 5-cyanophthalide of the formula-IX.<br><br>
Therefore such a low yielding process needs to be improved for commercial production of escitalopram.<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned process for the preparation of escitalopram, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of escitalopram.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for a process for the preparation of escitalopram will be to (a) avoid the usage of 5-cyanophthalide as starting material (b) avoid the purification of intermediates involved in making escitalopram thereby making the process commercially viable and economical.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram, which is commercially applicable.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram avoiding the usage of 5-cyanophthalide thereby making the process simple and economical.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of escitalopram avoiding the purification techniques for the intermediates formed in the process thereby making the process fiuther simpler and economical.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation ofescitalopram wherein the overall yield is 25-35%.<br>
As an alternative process for the preparation of escitalopram disclosed in the above mentioned prior art patent, we looked particularly into the original process developed by Lundbeck for dl-citalopram (Scheme-I above). In this route, the bromo-analogue (compound of the formula-IV) of the intermediate compoimd of the formula-XI can be separated into  its enantiomers by conventional  resolution techniques  (preferential<br><br>
crystallization of diastereomeric salts) and converted into escitalopram. However, in the original process for the preparation of compound of the formula-IV no purity has been mentioned. It only says that the intermediate compound of the formula-IV is prepared in an analogous manner. The yield given for the analogous compoimd of the formula-IV is only 55%. Therefore, such a process needs to be improved with respect to the yield of the compound of the formula-IV and its quality for its commercial usage in making escitalopram. Also, the compound of formula-IV is described as an oil.<br>
Surprisingly, we have foimd that if one does the sequential double Grignard reaction on 5-bromophthalide analogous to 5-cyanophthalide in tetrahydrofuran medium along with a non-polar co-solvent, the resulting magnesium salt (compound of the formula-XII) crystallizes from the reaction mass leaving all the related impurities in the reaction medium. The crystalline magnesium salt can be simply filtered off from the reaction mass and neutralized to get the pure compound of the formula-IV, an analogue of the compound of the formula-XI used in the known process for escitalopram. Although compound of the formula-IV is known, isolation of its magnesium salt in a pure form to get a pure product of the formula-IV is not known. We also found that di-magnesium salt derived from 5-cyanophthalide will not crystallize out from the reaction mixture under above-mentioned conditions (usage of non-polar co-solvent in Grignard reaction) for its bromo-analogue. The crystallization property to the di-magnesium salt of the formula-XII seems to be specific. The usage of a co-solvent in the double Grignard reaction on 5-bromophthalide and identification of crystalline property to the resulting di-magnesium salt and its isolation by filtration to get pure compound of the formula- XII is the novelty of the invention. Crystalline property of the resulting di-magnesium salt has not been identified earlier and also it has not been isolated. Such a crystalline property to the di-magnesium salt of the formula-XII in a mixture of tetrahydrofiiran and a non-polar solvent eliminated all the unwanted impurities after filtering off the di-magnesiimi salt of the compound of formula-XII from the reaction mass. The dihydroxy compound of the formula-IV obtained by this process was fovmd to be pure and crystalline and the yield was 70-75% of theory.<br><br><br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of ;scitalopram of the formula-(+)-I,<br>
which comprises: <br>
(i)       reacting 5-bromophthalide of the formula-II,<br><br>
with p-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide in THF medium with a non-polar co-solvent to get the benzophenone derivative of the formula-III,<br><br><br>

by preferential crystallization to get its (-)-enatiomer salt with (+)-di-p-<br>
toluoyltartaric acid (v)      Neutralizing the diastereomeric salt and reacting the liberated chiral base with<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride in basic medium to get the cyclic compound of the<br>
formula-(+)-V,<br><br><br>
(vi)     Reacting the compound of the fomiula-(+)-V with copper cynanide to get the chiral compound of the formula-(+)-I.<br><br>
(vii)    and  if desired converting the compound  of the  formula-(+)-I  into  its pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt, like oxalate, etc by conventional methods.<br>

(iii)     and Isolating the crystalline compound of the formula-XII by filtration.<br>
The Grignard reaction in steps (i) and (ii) may be effected at a temperature in the range of -25°C to 0°C preferably at a temperature in the range of -20°C to -10°C. The non-polar<br><br>
