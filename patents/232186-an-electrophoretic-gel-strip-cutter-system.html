				<td>FEILD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a electrophoretic gel strip cutter system.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Pulsed-field gel e1ectrophoresis, herein after referred as PFGE, technique has encouraged attempts to study DNA damage and repair in individual chromosomes of yeast or in high molecular wt DNA strands. It is well understood by those, who are conversant with the art that DNA damage, as referred herein above, generally means breaks in DNA strands leading to alteration in size and/or shape and/or conformation of DNA. Such DNA strand breaks are induced by DNA damaging agents. It is well understood by those who are conversant with the art that DNA damaging agents, as referred herein above, generally means, radiations alone or in combination with DNA binding ligands, photosensitisers or some of the anticancer drugs eg. Bleomycin which induce DNA strand breaks. The DNA exposed to DNA damaging agents, as referred herein above, is referred as 'treated DNA', herein after.<br>
To  study such effects, the DNA samples are  prepared<br>
and  developed  by  such  known  methods.  The  samples   are<br>
electrophoresed using PFGE technique and  photographed  after<br>
staining   and   destaining   the   gels.   Such   developed<br>
photographs/  photonegatives  are used to estimate  the  DNA<br>
damage  and  repair,  preferably after  scanning  under  the<br>
densitometer.<br>
In the pulsed field electrophoresed agarose gels, thus obtained, the DNA bands, each representing a chromosome, are possilble to be resolved clearly in untreated samples only. However, in 'treated DNA' as referred herein above, the resolution of bands decreases and the smear appears, particularly in the lower molecular weight range. The appearance of smear limits the analysis of damage to only clearly resolved bands preferably in the high molecular weight region. Therefore, instead of quantifying DNA damage<br>
and  repair  of all the bands, by such known  methods,  using such  known techniques and by adopting such known devices  is'<br>
restricted to/quantitatioh of DNA damage and repair  to  only clearly resolved bands of high molecular weight region only.<br>
Another disadvantage of the smear thus appeared particularly in the low molecular weight region by such known methods using such known techniques and by adopting such known devices is that quantification of different types of damage, more precisely quantification of double strand breaks is not possible. Therefore quantification is limited to estimation of average DNA damage and repair based on alterations in the intensity ratios of DNA bands.<br>
Such limitations of such known methods using such known techniques by adopting such known devices, as stated herein above, that is being able to quantify only average DNA damage and repair in clearly resolved bands of high molecular weight only rather than being able to quantify The DNA double strand breaks or reapir i.e. different types of DNA damage or repair in all the chromosomal DNA bands individually, are mainly due to the drawbacks of the known electrophoretic gel cutters.<br>
The known electrophoretic gel cutters have a single blade to generate a single cut in the gel as referred herein above. These known gel cutters are mainly used to cut the gel into two or more number of pieces, herein after referred as gel pieces. Only one cut is made at a time with the help of single blade cutter. Such gel pieces are of irregular size, shape and of different length and width because they are generated with the help of known gel cutters by free hand movement. The chances of irregularity in shape and size increases when a cut larger than approx. 1 cm length is made.<br>
The known electrophoretic gel cutters, when used with the known PFGE techniques results in the formation of smear on the chromosomal bands, after it is irradiated as stated<br>
v<br>
herein above, which in turn can not be resolved to  separate the DNA fragments from the chromosomal bands.<br>
Still another disadvantage of formation of smear by use of known electrophoretic gel cutters with known PFBE technique is that the formation of such smear does not allow to identify the belongingness of the smear of DMA fragments with individual or particular or specific chromosome.<br>
Still another disadvantage of formation of such smears by use of such known e leetrophoretic gel cutters with known PFGE technique is that the formation of such smear does not allow to resolve the mixture of DNA fragments, according to their belongingness to the individual or specific chromosomal band, obtained after irradiation and which in turn would have been separated after pulsed field gel electrophoresis.<br>
The main disavantage of such irregular shape gel pieces generated by known such e1ectrophoretic gel cutters, as referred herein above, is that these gel pieces have uneven edges and therefore, do not fit }nto the slots generated in the gel for electrophoresis. These gel pieces generated by known gel cutters are therefore, unsuitable for further developing the assay to study the in-vitro DNA damage to individual or say specific chromosome, irrespective of their molecular weight which in turn results in the disadvatages/ drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above in the foregoing description, that is limiting the quantification only to quantitation of average DNA damage and repair of individual bands resolved in the high molecular weight range only.<br>
Therefore, the known electrophoretic gel cutters, as known in the prior art, do not permit to record the mobility of each individual chromosome or its DNA fragments to estimate the DNA damage and repair in individual chromosomes.<br>
Still another disadvantage of such gel pieces generated by the eleetrophoretic gel cutters, known in the art, is' that opposite ends of such gel pieces are not parallel, thereby causing loss of DNA samples in atleast some of the DNA bands therby making them unsuitable for further development of assay to study specific DNA damage and repair in all the individual chromosomal bands irrespective of'their molecular weight.<br>
Still another disadvantage of such known gel cutters is that, there are no means to generate a parallel strip of gel with accurately adjusted width which in turn may result in damaging the slots of gala rendering the gel slots, unsuitable for further development of the assay.<br>
Still another disadvantage of such known cutters is that there is no provision of a guide to adjust the length of gel strip with respect to the length of gel slot generated to hold the sample for further development of already developed assay.<br>
The  further disadvantage of such known gel  cutters	is<br>
that  there is no provision to adjust the angle to  hold	the<br>
cutter  while  cutting the gel which in turn  makes  the	gel<br>
cutting a very inconvenient process.<br>
The further disadvantage of such known cutters i r5 that to generate a gel strip one has to cut very slowly and two times rendering the entire process a time consuming process. Since the entire operation is generally performed in presence of UV (ultra-voi1et)-light, as known to those who are conversant with the art, the user is exposed to the UV-light for much longer period. Such an occupational exposure to UV-light is known to cause mutations which could result in c ancers.<br>
OBJECTS_OF_THE_INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to  propose electrophoretic gel strip cutter system, the device comprising of a guide and twin-blade gel strip cutter, wherein the device  obviates  the  disadvantages  and limitations of the prior art.<br>
Another  object  of  this invention  is  to  propose	an<br>
e1ectrophoretic gel atrip cutter sy»tem which can permit	the<br>
analysis  and  quantification of the actual or  specific	DNA<br>
damage to all the individual chromosomes.<br>
Yet another abject of the present invention is to propose for an electrophoretic gel strip cutter system which can permit to resolve the smear to separate the DNA fragments, particularly which can permit to identify the be longingness of the smear of DNA fragments to the individual or particularly or specific chromosomal DNA band, more particularly, which can permit to resolve the mixture of DNA fragments, according to their belongingness to the individual or specific chromosome obtained after treating the untreated DNA embeded in the agarose gel, which in turn has been already obtained by using the known such eleetrophoretic gel cutters with known such PFGE technique.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a system, which can generate gel strip of even edges which can be inserted into the gel slots generated through improved single strip electrophoresis comb to hold the sample for further developing the assay, more particularly the chromosomal prof.ile, which has already been developed once by using the known e1ectrophoretic gel cutter with PFGE technique.<br>
Still further object of this invention ia to propose a system which can generate gel strips with parallel opposite ends so that there is no loss of DNA samples from either of the chromosomal DNA bands and thereby permitting to record the mobility of each individual chromosome or its fragments already separated by using known e1ectrophoresis gel stip cutter with known PFGE technique, to estimate specific DNA damage in each chromosome induced by the DNA damaging .agents.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a system which can generate gel strips with accurately adjusted width, which in turn does not damage the gel slots generated<br><br>
to  hold  the  sample,,  thereby  allowing  the   further development of the assay.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a system which can generate gel strips of known length with respect to the length of the gel slot generated to hold the sample.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a system which can generate parallel gel strips of known width and length, having smooth and even edges in a single move thereby enabling speedy generation of gel strips, which in turn minimises the exposure time of the user to the harmful UV—light which can cause mutations, and cancer. <br>
