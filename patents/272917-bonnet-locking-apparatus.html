[0001]	The present application is a continuation-in-part (CIP) application of U.S.<br>
Application No. 11/124,633, which was filed May 6, 2005 as a CIP of U.S. Application No. 10/322,038, which was filed December 17, 2002 as a CIP application of U.S. Application No. 09/849,218, which was filed May 4, 2001 and issued as U.S. Patent No. 6,510,897. These applications and patent are expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to blowout preventers used in the oil and gas<br>
industry. Specifically, the invention relates to a blowout preventer with a novel bonnet securing mechanism.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0003]	Well control is an important aspect of oil and gas exploration. When drilling<br>
a well in, for example, oil and gas exploration applications, devices must be put in place to prevent injury to personnel and equipment associated with the drilling activities. One such well control devtee in known as a blowout preventer (BOP).<br>
[0004]	Blowout preventers are generally used to seal a wellbore.    For example,<br>
drilling wells in oil or gas explotation involves penetrating a variety of subsurface geologic structures, or "layers." Each layer generally comprises a specific geologic composition such as, for example, shale, sandstone, limestone, etc. Each layer may contain trapped fluids or gas at different formation pressures, and the formation pressures increase with increasing depth. The pressure in the wellbore is generally adjusted to at least balance the formation pressure by, for example, increasing a density of drilling mud in the wellbore or increasing pump pressure at the surface of the well.<br>
[0005]	There  are  occasions  during  drilling  operations  when   a  wellbore  may<br>
penetrate a layer having a formation pressure substantially higher than the pressure<br>
maintained in the wellbore. When this occurs, the well is said to have "taken a kick." The pressure increase associated with the kick is generally produced by an influx of formation fluids (which may be a liquid, a gas, or a combination thereof) into the wellbore. The relatively high pressure kick tends to propagate from a point of entry in the wellbore uphole (from a high pressure region to a low pressure region). If the kick is allowed to reach the surface, drilling fluid, well tools, and other drilling structures may be blown out of the wellbore. These "blowouts" often result in catastrophic destruction of the drilling equipment (including, for example, the drilling rig) and in substantial injury or death of rig personnel.<br>
[0006]	Because of the risk of blowouts, blowout preventers are typically installed at<br>
the surface or on the sea floor in deep water drilling arrangements so that kicks may be adequately controlled and "circulated out" of the system. Blowout preventers may be activated to effectively seal in a wellbore until active measures can be taken to control the kick. There are several types of blowout preventers, the most common of which are annular blowout preventers and ram-type blowout preventers.<br>
[0007]	Annular blowout preventers typically comprise annular elastomer "packers"<br>
that may be activated (e.g., inflated) to encapsulate drillpipe and well tools and completely seal the wellbore. A second type of the blowout preventer is the ram-type blowout preventer. Ram-type preventers typically comprise a body and at least two oppositely disposed bonnets. The bonnets are generally secured to the body about their circumference with, for example, bolts. Alternatively, bonnets may be secured to the body with a hinge and bolts so that the bonnet may be rotated to the side for maintenance access.<br>
[0008]	Interior of each bonnet is a piston actuated ram. The rams may be either pipe<br>
rams (which, when activated, move to engage and surround drillpipe and well tools to seal the wellbore) or shear rams (which, when activated, move to engage and physically shear any drillpipe or well tools in the wellbore). The rams are typically located opposite of each other and, whether pipe rams or shear rams, the rams typically seal against one another proximate a center of the wellbore in order to completely seal the wellbore.<br>
[0009]	As with any tool used in dulling oil and gas wells, blowout preventers must<br>
be regularly maintained.   For example, blowout preventers comprise high pressure<br>
seals between the bonnets and the body of the BOP. The high pressure seals in many instances are elastomer seals. The elastomer seals must be regularly checked to ensure that the elastomer has not been cut, permanently deformed, or deteriorated by, for example, chemical reaction with the drilling fluid in the wellbore. Moreover, it is often desirable to replace pipe rams with shear rams, or vice versa, to provide different well control options. Therefore, it is important that the blowout preventer includes bonnets that are easily removable so that interior components, such as the rams, may be accessed and maintained.<br>
[0010]	Developing blowout preventers that are easy to maintain is a difficult task.<br>
For example, as previously mentioned, bonnets are typically connected to the BOP body by bolts or a combination of a hinge and bolts. The bolts must be highly torqued in order to maintain a seal between a bonnet door and the BOP body. The seal between the bonnet and the BOP body is generally a face seal, and the seal must be able to withstand the very high pressures present in the wellbore.<br>
[0011]	As a result, special tools and equipment are necessary to install and remove<br>
the bonnet doors and bonnets so that the interior of the BOP body may be accessed. The time required to install and remove the bolts connecting the bonnet doors to the BOP body results in rig downtime, which is both expensive and inefficient. Moreover, substantially large bolts and a nearly complete "bolt circle" around the circumference of the bonnet door are generally required to provide sufficient force to hold the bonnet door against the body of the BOP. The size of the bolts and the bolt circle may increase a "stack height" of the BOP. It is common practice to operate a "stack" of BOPs (where several BOPs are installed in a vertical relationship), and a minimized stack height is desirable in drilling operations.<br>
[0012]	Several attempts have been made to reduce stack height and the time<br>
required to access the interior of the BOP. U.S. Patent No. 5,655,745 issued to Morrill shows a pressure energized seal carrier that eliminates the face seal between the bonnet door and the BOP body. The BOP shown in the '745 patent enables the use of fewer, smaller bolts in less than a complete bolt circle for securing the bonnet to the body. Moreover, the ;745 patent shows that a hinge may be used in place of at least some of the bolts.<br>
[0013]	U.S. Patent No. 5,897,094 issued to Brugman et al. discloses an improved<br>
BOP door connection that includes upper and lower connector bars for securing bonnets to the BOP. The improvctl BOP door connection of the '094 patent does not use bolts to secure the bonnels to the BOP and discloses a design that seeks to minimize a stack height of the BOP.<br>
[0014]	Accordingly, there exists a need for a secure bonnet locking apparatus that<br>
allows for easy access of a BOP for niuinlonance of the BOP and replacement of<br>
rams.<br>

DETAILRI) DESCRIPTION<br>
[0063]	An embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 1.   A ram-type blowout<br>
preventer (BOP) 10 comprises a BOP body 12 and oppositely disposed bonnet assemblies 14. The BOP body 12 further comprises couplings 16 (which may be, for example, flanges) on an upper surface and a lower surface of the BOP body 12 for coupling the BOP 10 to, for example, another BOP or to another well tool. The BOP body 12 comprises an internal bore 18 Iheretlirough for the passage of drilling fluids, drillpipe, well tools, and the like used to drill, for example, an oil or gas well. The BOP body 12 further comprises a plurality of side passages 20 wherein each of the plurality of side passages 20 is generally adapted to be coupled to a bonnet assembly 14.<br>
[0064]	The bonnet assemblies 14 arc coupled to the BOP body 12, typically in<br>
opposing pairs as shown in Figure 1. Each bonnet assembly 14 further comprises a plurality of components adapted to seal Ihe bonnet assembly 14 to the BOP body 12<br>
and to activate a ram piston 22 within each bonnet assembly 14. Components of the bonnet assemblies 14 comprise passages therethrough for movement of the ram piston 22.<br>
[0065]	Each bonnet assembly 14 generally comprises similar components.   While<br>
each bonnet assembly 14 is a separate and distinct part of the BOP 10, the operation and structure of each bonnet assembly 14 is similar. Accordingly, in order to simplify the description of the operation of the BOP 10 and of the bonnet assemblies 14, the components and operation of one bonnet assembly 14 will be described in detail. It should be understood that each bonnet assembly 14 operates in a similar manner and that, for example, opposing bonnet assemblies 14 typically operate in a coordinated manner.<br>
[0066]	Proceeding with the description of the operation of one bonnet assembly 14,<br>
the piston 22 is adapted to be coupled to a ram (not shown) that may be, for example, a pipe ram or a shear ram. Each ram piston 22 is coupled to a ram actuator cylinder 24 that is adapted to displace the ram piston 22 axially within the bonnet assembly 14 in a direction generally perpendicular to an axis of the BOP body 12, the axis of the BOP body 12 being generally defined as a vertical axis of the internal bore 18 (which is generally parallel with inspect to a well bore axis). A ram (not shown) is generally coupled to the  nun piston 22, and, if the rams (not shown) are shear rams, the axial displacement of the ram piston 22 generally moves the ram (not shown) into the internal bore 18 and into contact with a corresponding ram (not shown) coupled to a ram piston 22 as a bonnet assembly 14 disposed on an opposite side of the BOP 10.<br>
[0067]	Alternatively, if the rams (not shown) are pipe rams, axial displacement of<br>
the ram piston generally moves the rani (not shown) into the internal bore 18 and into contact with a corresponding ram (not shown) and with drillpipe and/or well tools present in the wellbore. Therefore, activation of the ram actuator cylinder 24 displaces the ram piston 22 and moves the ram (not shown) into a position to block a flow of drilling and/or formation fluid through the internal bore 18 of the BOP body 12 and, in doing so. to form a high pressure seal that prevents fluid flow from passing into or out of the wellbore (not shown).<br>
[0068]	The ram actuator cylinder 24 further comprises an actuator 26 which may be,<br>
for example, a hydraulic actuator. However, other types of actuators are known in the art and may be used with the invention. Note that for purposes of the description of the invention, a "fluid" may be defined as a gas, a liquid, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0069]	For example, if the ram (not shown) is a pipe ram, activation of the ram<br>
piston 22 moves the ram (not shown) into position to seal around drillpipe (not shown) or well tools (not shown) passing through the internal bore 18 in the BOP body 12. Further, if the ram (not shown) is a shear ram, activation of the ram piston 22 moves the ram (not shown) into position to shear any drillpipe (not shown) or well tools (not shown) passing through the internal bore 18 of the BOP body 12 and, therefore, seal the internal bore 18.<br>
Radial Lock Mechanism for Coupling Bonnets to BOPs<br>
[0070]	An important aspect of a BOP 10 is the mechanism by which the bonnet<br>
assemblies 14 are sealed to the body 12. Figure 1 shows a radial lock mechanism 28 that is designed to provide a high pressure radial seal between the bonnet assembly 14 and the BOP body 12. Moreover, the radial lock mechanism 28 is designed to simplify maintenance of the bonnet assembly 14 and the rams (not shown) positioned therein.<br>
[0071]	In the embodiments shown in the Figures, the side passages 20 and other<br>
components of the BOP 10 designed to be engaged therewith and therein are shown as being oval or substantially elliptical in shape. An oval or substantially elliptical shape (e.g., an oval cross-section) helps reduce the stack height of the BOP, thereby minimizing weight, material used, and cost. Other shapes such as circular shapes, however, are also suitable for use with the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should not be limited lo I he shapes of the embodiments shown in the Figures.<br>
[0072]	The radial lock mechanism 28 is positioned within the bonnet assembly 14<br>
and within the side passage 20 of the BOP body 12. In this embodiment, the radial lock mechanism 28 comprises a bonnet :seals 29 disposed on a bonnet body 30, a radial lock 32, a radial lock dispalacement device 34, a bonnet door 36, and lock actuators 38. The bonnet seal 29 coopperatively seals the bonnet body 30 to the BOP<br>
body 12 proximate the side passive 20. The bonnet seal 29 comprises a high pressure seal that prevents fluids from the internal bore 18 of the BOP body 12 from escaping via the side passage 20- Various embodiments of the bonnet seal 29 will be discussed in detail below.<br>
[0073]	When the bonnet seal 29 is formed between the bonnet body 30 and the BOP<br>
body 12, the bonnet body 30 is in an installed position and is located proximate the BOP body 12 and at least partially within the side passage 20. Because the bonnet seal 29 is a high pressure seal, the radial lock mechanism 28 must be robust and able to withstand very high pressures present in the internal bore 18.<br>
[0074]	The embodiment shown in Figure  1  comprises a novel mechanism for<br>
locking the bonnet assembly 14 (and, as a result, the bonnet seal 29) in place. Referring to Figure 2, the radial lock 32 has an inner diameter adapted to fit over an exterior surface 40 of the bonnet body 30 and slide into a position adjacent a sealing end of the bonnet body 30. The radial lock 32 shown in Figure 2 comprises two halves separated by a center cut 46. However, the radial lock 32 may comprise additional segments and the two segment embodiment shown in Figure 2 is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Additional embodiments of the radial lock 32 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
(0075]	The radial lock displacement device 34 also has an inner diameter adapted to<br>
fit over the exterior surface 40 of the bonnet body 30. Moreover, the radial lock displacement device 34 further comprises a wedge surface 48 on an external diameter that is adapted to fit inside an inner diameter 50 of the radial lock 32. The radial lock displacement device 34 also comprises an inner face 56 that is adapted to contact an outer surface 54 of the BOP body 12. In an installed position, the bonnet body 30, the radial lock 32, and the radial lock displacement device 34 are positioned between the BOP body 12 and the bonnet door 36. An inner surface 52 of the bonnet door 36 is adapted to contact the outer surface 54 of the BOP body 12. Note that the engagement between the bonnet door 36 and the BOP body 12 is not fixed (e.g., the bonnet door 36 is not bolted to the BOP body 12).<br>
[0076]	Referring again to Figure I. the bonnet assembly 14 is adapted to slidably<br>
engage at least one rod 70 through a swivel slide mount 74 (note, that two rods 70 are shown slidably engaged, through the swivel slide mounts 74, with each bonnet<br>
assembly 14 in Figure 1). As a result of the slidable engagement, the bonnet assembly 14 may slide along the rods 70. As will be discussed below, the slidable engagement permits the bonnet assembly 14 to be moved into and out of locking and sealing engagement with the BOP body 12.<br>
[0077]	The lock actuators 38 are coupled to the bonnet door 36 with either a fixed or<br>
removable coupling comprising bolls, adhesive, welds, threaded connections, or similar means known in the art. The lock actuators 38 are also cooperatively coupled to the radial lock displacement device 34 in a similar fashion. Additionally, the coupling between the lock actutors 38 and the radial lock displacement device 34 may be a simple contact engagemnetl. Note that the embodiments in Figure 1 shows two lock actuators 38 coupled to each bonnet door 36. However, a single lock actuator cylinder 38 or a plurulilyof lock actuators 38 may be used with the invention. The lock actuators 38 .shown are generally hydraulic cylinders; however, other types of lock actuators (including, for example, pneumatic actuators, electrically powered motors, and the like) are known in the art and may be used with the invention.<br>
[0078]	Moreover, the lock actuators 38 may also be manually operated.   The lock<br>
actuators 38 shown in the present embodiment are typically controlled by, for example, an external electrical signal, a flow of pressurized hydraulic fluid, etc. As an alternative, the radial lock 32 may be activated by manual means, such as, for example, a lever, a system of levers, a threaded actuation device, or other similar means known in the art. Further, if, for example, the lock actuators 38 comprise hydraulic cylinders, the hydraulic cylinders may be activated by a manual pump. Accordingly, manual activation of the radial lock 32 is within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0079]	A fully assembled view of the bonnet assembly 14 including the radial lock<br>
mechanism 28 is shown in Figure 2. During operation of the radial lock mechanism 28, the bonnet assembly 14 is first moved into position proximate the BOP body 12 by sliding the bonnet assembly 14 toward the BOP body 12 on the rods 70. The lock actuators 38 are then activated so that they axially displace (wherein an axis of displacement corresponds to an axis of the side passage 20) the radial lock displacement device 34 in a direction toward the BOP body 12. As the radial lock displacement device 34 moves axially toward the BOP body 12, the wedge surface<br>
48 contacts the inner diameter 50 of the radial lock 32, thereby moving the radial lock 32 in a radially outward direction (e.g., toward an inner radial lock surface 58 of the side passage 20). When the activation of the radial lock mechanism 28 is complete, an inner nose 60 of the radial lock displacement device 34 is proximate a load shoulder 44 of the bonnet body 30, and an outer perimeter 62 of the radial lock 32 is lockingty engaged with the inner radial lock surface 58. Moreover, as will be described below, both the radial lock 32 and the inner radial lock surface 58 typically comprise angled surfaces (refer to, for example, the engagement surfaces described in the discussion of Figures 10 and 11 infra). When the radial lock 32 engages the inner radial lock surface 58, the angled surfaces are designed to provide an axial force that "pulls" the bonnet door 36 in an axially inward direction and finnly against the exterior of the BOP body 12 and thereby completes the locking engagement of the radial lock mechanism 28.<br>
[0080]	When the radial lock 32 is secured in place by the activation of the lock<br>
actuators 38 and the radial lock displacement device 34, the bonnet body 30 and the bonnet assembly 14 are axially locked in place with respect to the BOP body 12 without the use of, for example, bolts. However, an additional manual locking mechanism (not shown) may also be used in combination with the invention to ensure that the radial lock 32 remains securely in place. Once the radial lock 32 is secured in place by. for example, hydraulic actuation, a manual lock (not shown), such as a pinned or threaded mechanism may be activated as an additional restraint. The secured radial locking mechanism 28 is designed to hold the bonnet assembly 14 and. accordingly, the high pressure bonnet seal 29 in place. The radial lock 32 and the high pressure bonnet seal 29 can withstand the high forces generated by the high pressures present within the internal bore 18 of the BOP body 12 because of the locking engagement between the radial lock 32 and the inner radial lock surface 58 of the BOP body 12.<br>
(00811	The radial lock mechanism 28 may be disengaged by reversing the activation<br>
of the lock actuators 38 (e.g., after the pressure in the internal bore 18 has been relieved). As a result, the invention comprises a radial lock mechanism 28 that includes a positive disengagement system (e.g., the lock actuators 38 must be activated in order to disengage the radial lock mechanism 28).<br>
10082]	The wedge surface 48 used to radially displace the radial lock 32 may<br>
comprise any one of several embodiments. Referring to Figure 3, in one embodiment, the wedge surface 48 of the radial lock displacement device 34 may comprise a single actuation step 80. In another embodiment shown in Figure 4, the wedge surface 48 may comprise a dual actuation step 82. Note that the single actuation step (80 in Figure 3) generally has a shorter actuation stroke than the dual actuation step (82 in Figure 4). Further, an actuation step angle (84 in Figures 3 and 4) is designed to maximize a radial actuation force and minimize a linear actuation force. In one embodiment of the invention, the actuation step angle (84 in Figures 3 and 4) is approximately 45 degrees. In another embodiment of the invention, the actuation step angle (84 in Figures 3 and 4) is less than 45 degrees.<br>
[0083]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 5, the radial lock displacement<br>
device 34 further comprises a slot 90 and at least one retention pin 92 designed to retain the radial lock 32 against the load shoulder 44 of the bonnet body 30. In this embodiment, the radial lock 32 is retained in place by the at least one retention pin 92, and the bonnet body 30 and the radial lock 32 are held in a fixed relationship after the radial lock 32 has been actuated and is in locking engagement with the inner radial lock surface (58 in Figure 2) of the side passage (20 in Figure ]).<br>
[0084]	The radial lock (32 in  Figure  1) may also comprise any one of several<br>
embodiments. The radial lock 32 shown in the embodiment of Figure 1 comprises two radial mirrored halves 94, 96, as further shown in Figure 6A. In another embodiment, as shown in Figure 6B, a radial lock 100 may be formed from at least two substantially linear segments 102 and at least two semicircular end segments 104. In another embodiment, as shown in Figure 6C, a radial lock 106 may be formed from a plurality of substantially straight dogs 108 and a plurality of curved clogs 110. The embodiments shown in Figures 6B and 6C essentially comprise radial locks 100. 106 similar to the radial lock (32 in Figures 1 and 6A) of the first embodiment but divided into a plurality of segments. The radial locks 100, 106 could be manufactured by. for example, manufacturing a solid radial lock and sequentially saw cutting the solid radial lock into two or more segments. However, other manufacturing techniques are known in the art and may be used to manufacture the radial lock.<br>
[0085]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 7, a radial lock 112 may be formed<br>
from a notched serpentine structure 114 similar to a "serpentine belt." The radial lock 112 is formed, for example, as a single solid piece and then cut 117 through an inner perimeter 114 or an outer perimeter 116. The cuts 117 can either completely transect the radiaflock 112 or may include only partial cuts. Further, if the cuts 117 transect the radial lock 112, the individual segments can be attached to a flexible band 118 so that the radial lock 112 can be actuated with an actuating ring (34 in Figure 1). The flexible band 118 may comprise a material with a relatively low elastic modulus (when compared to, for example, the elastic modulus of the individual segments) so that the flexible band 118 can radially expand in response to the radial displacement produced by the radial lock displacement device (34 in Figure 1). Radial expansion of the flexible band 118 results in a locking engagement between the radial lock 112 and the inner radial lock surface (58 in Figure 2) of the BOP body (12 in Figure 1).<br>
10086)	The engagement between the radial lock (32 in Figure 1) and the inner radial<br>
lock surface (58 in Figure 2) may also comprise different embodiments. In one embodiment, as shown in Figure 8, a radial lock 120 may comprise a single profile engagement including a single radial lock engagement surface 122. The single radial lock engagement surface 122 is designed to lockingly engage a BOP engagement surface (59 in Figure 2) formed on the inner radial lock surface (58 in Figure 2) of the side passage (20 in Figure 1).<br>
10087[	In another embodiment, as shown in Figure 9, a radial lock 124 comprises a<br>
dual profile engagement including two radial lock engagement surfaces 126. Moreover, the radial lock 124 may also comprise a plurality of radial lock engagement surfaces designed to lockingly engage a corresponding number of BOP engagement surfaces (59 in Figure 2) formed on the inner radial lock surface (58 in Figure 2) of the side passage (20 in Figure 1) of the BOP body (12 in Figure 1).<br>
[0088]	The radial locks described in the referenced embodiments are designed so<br>
that the cross-sectional area of engagement between the radial lock engagement surfaces with the BOP engagement surfaces (59 in Figure 2) is maximized. Maximizing the cross-sectional areas of engagement ensures that the radial locks positively lock the bonnet assembly (14 in Figure 1) and, as a result, the bonnet seal<br>
(29 in Figure 1) in place against the high pressures present in the internal bore (18 in Figure 1) of the BOP (10 in Figure 1). Moreover, as discussed previously, angles of the engagement surfaces may be designed to produce an axial force that firmly pulls the bonnet door (36 in Figure 1) against the BOP body (12 in Figure 1) and that in some embodiments may assist in the activation of the bonnet seal (29 in Figure 1).<br>
10089]	The radial locks and the engagement surfaces described in the foregoing<br>
embodiments may be coated with, for example, hardfacing materials and/or friction reducing materials. The coatings may help prevent, for example, galling, and may prevent the radial locks from stick ing oi "hnnging-up" in the engagement surfaces during the activation and/or deactivation of I he radial lock mechanism (28 in Figure 1). The coatings may also increusui the life of the radial locks and the engagement surfaces by reducing friction and wear.<br>
[0090]	Another embodiment of Iho lock ring is shown at 127 in Figure 10.   The<br>
radial lock 127 comprises a plurality of saw cuts 128, a plurality of holes 129, or a combination thereof. The saw cuts 128 and/or holes 129 decrease the weight and area moment of inertia of the radial lock 127, thereby reducing the actuation force required to radially displace the radial lock 127. In order to permit some elastic deformation of the radial lock 127, the radial lock 127 may be formed from a material having a relatively low modulus of elasticity (when compared to, for example, steel). Such materials comprise titanium, beryllium copper, etc. Moreover, modifications to the radial lock 127 geometry, in addition to those referenced above, may be made to, for example, further reduce the area moment of inertia of the radial lock 127 and reduce bending stresses.<br>
[0091]	The radial locks described above are designed to operate below an elastic<br>
limit of the materials from which they are formed. Operation below the elastic limit ensures that the radial locks will not permanently deform and, as a result of the permanent deformation, lose effectiveness. Accordingly, material selection and cross-sectional area of engagement of the engagement surfaces is very important to the design of the radial lock mechanism (28 in Figure 1).<br>
[0092|	Referring to Figure 1, the bonnet seal 29 is designed to withstand the high<br>
pressures present in the internal bore 18 of the BOP body 12 and to thereby prevent fluids and/or gases from passing from the internal bore 18 to the exterior of the BOP10. The bonnet seal 29 may comprise several different configurations as shown in the following discussion of Figures 13-17. Moreover, the seals disclosed in the discussion below may be formed from a variety of materials. For example, the seals may be elastomer seals or non-elastomer seals (such as, for example, metal seals, PEEK seals, etc.). Metal seals may further comprise metal-to-metal C-ring seals and/or metal-to-metal lip seals. Further, the sealing arrangements shown below may include a combination of seal types and materials. Accordingly, the type of seal, number of seals, and the material used to form radial and face seals are not intended to limit the bonnet seal 29.<br>
[0093]	The embodiment in Figure 11 comprises a bonnet seal 130 formed on a<br>
radial perimeter 132 of a bonnet body 133. The radial seal 130 further comprises two o-rings 134 disposed in grooves 136 formed on the radial perimeter 132 of the bonnet body 133. The o-rings 134 sealingiy engage an inner sealing perimeter 138 of the side passage (20 in Figure 1) in the BOP body 12. The embodiment shown in Figure 11 comprises two grooves 136, but a single groove or a plurality of grooves may be suitable for use with the o-rings 134. Moreover, while the embodiment shows two o-rings 134, a single o-ring or more than two o-rings may be used in the invention.<br>
[0094]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 12, a bonnet seal 140 comprises at<br>
least two packing seals 146 (which may be, for example, t-seals, lip seals, or seals sold under the trademark Polypub, which is a mark of Parker Hannifin, Inc.) disposed in grooves 148 formed radial perimeter 142 of a bonnet body 144. The packing seals 146 sealingiy engage nn inner sealing perimeter 150 of the side passage (20 in Figure 1) of the BOP body 12. The embodiment shown in Figure 12 comprises two grooves 148, but a single groove or a plurality of grooves may be suitable for use with the packing seals 146. Moreover, while the embodiment shows two packing seals 146, a single seal or more than two seals may be used in the invention.<br>
(0095]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 13, the bonnet seal 152 comprises a<br>
radial seal 154 disposed in a groove 166 formed on a radial perimeter 160 of a bonnet body 162. Moreover, the embodiment comprises a face seal 156 disposed in a groove 164 fonned on a mating face surface 168 of the bonnet body 162. The radial seal 154 is adapted to sealingiy engage an inner sealing perimeter 158 of the<br>
side passage (20 in Figure 1) of the BOP body 12. The face seal 156 is adapted to sealingly engage an exterior face 170 of the BOP body 12. The radial seal 154 and face seal 156 shown in the embodiment are both o-rings and are disposed in single grooves 166, 164. However, a different type of seal (such as, for example, a packing seal) and more than one seal (disposed in at least one groove) may be used with the invention.<br>
[0096]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 14, the bonnet seal 3 72 comprises a<br>
radial seal 174 disposed in a groove 178 formed on a seal carrier 180. The seal carrier 180 is disposed in a groove 182 formed in a bonnet body 184 and also comprises a face seal 176 disposed in a groove 177 formed on the seal carrier 180. The face seal 176 is adapted to sealingly engage mating face surface 186 of the BOP body 12, and the radial seal is adapted to sealingly engage an inner sealing perimeter 188 formed on the bonnet body 184. The bonnet seal 172 may also comprise an energizing mechanism 190 that is adapted to displace the seal carrier 180 in a direction toward the exterior surface 186 of the BOP body 12 so as to energize the face seal 176. The energizing mechanism 190 may comprise, for example, a spring, a thrust washer, or a similar structure.<br>
(0097]	The energizing mechanism 190 helps ensure that the face seal 176 maintains<br>
positive contact with and, thus, maintains a high pressure seal with the exterior surface 186 of the BOP body 12. However, the energizing mechanism 190 is not required in all embodiments. For example, the seal earner 1 80 may be designed so that both the radial seal ] 74 and the face seal 176 are pressure activated without the assistance of an energizing mechanism 190.<br>
[0098J	In the embodiment without an energizing mechanism, a diameter and an<br>
axial thickness of a seal carrier (such as the seal carrier 180 shown in Figure 14) are selected so that high pressure from the internal bore first moves the seal carrier toward the exterior surface of the BOP' body. Once the face seal sealingly engages the exterior surface, the high pressure from the internal bore causes the seal carrier to radially expand until the radial seal sealingly engages the groove in the seal earner. A similar design is disclosed in 1 J.S Patent No. 5,255,890 issued to Morrill and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The '890 patent clearly describes the geometry required for .such a seal carrier.<br>
[0099]	In the embodiment shown in Figure: 14. the face seal 176 and the radial seal<br>
174 may be, for example, o-ring', packing seals, or any other high pressure seal known in the art. Moreover, Figure 14 only shows single seals disposed in single grooves. However, more than one seal, more than one groove, or a combination thereof may be used with the invention.<br>
[00100]	In another embodiment shown in Figure 15, the seal carrier 192 as shown in<br>
the previous embodiment is used in combination with a backup seal 194 disposed in a groove 196 on an external surface 198 of a bonnet body 200. The backup seal 194 may be an o-ring, a packing seal, a metal seal, or any other high pressure seal known in the art. The backup seal 194 further maintains a high pressure seal if, for example, there is leakage from the seals disposed on the seal carrier 192. Note that the embodiment shown in Figure 15 does not include an energizing mechanism.<br>
[00101]	Advantageously,  some of the  seal  embodiments  reduce an  axial  force<br>
necessary to form the bonnet seal. The bonnet seals shown above greatly reduce the sensitivity of the bonnet seal to door ilex by maintaining a constant squeeze regardless of wellbore pressure. The radial seal arrangements also reduce the total area upon which wellbore pressure acts and thus reduces a separation force that acts to push the bonnet door away from the BOP body.<br>
[00102]	In another embodiment of the radial lock shown in Figure 16, the radial lock<br>
mechanism 220 comprises a radial lock 222 disposed in a recess 224 formed on an internal surface 226 of a side passage 228 of a BOP body 230. The operation of the radial lock mechanism 220 differs from the embodiments described above in that securing a bonnet body 232 and, accordingly, a bonnet door (not shown) and a bonnet assembly (not shown), in place is accomplished by actuating the radial lock mechanism 220 in radially inward direction.<br>
[00103]	The structure of the embodiment shown in Figure  16 is similar to the<br>
structure of the embodiments described above except for the direction of actuation of the radial lock mechanism 220. Therefore, the discussion of the present embodiment will include a description of how the alternative radial lock mechanism 220 differs from those shown above. Common elements of the embodiments (such as, for example, the bonnet door 36, the linear rods 70, etc.) will not be described again in detail. Moreover, it should be noted that the embodiment of Figure 16 does<br>
not require, for example, actuator cylinders or a radial lock displacement device' (e.g.,   the   embodiment   of Figure   16   does   not   require   an   internal  actuation mechanism).<br>
[00104]	Actuation   of the   radial   lock   222   is   in   a   radially   inward   direction.<br>
Accordingly, the radial lock 222 must be coupled to an actuation mechanism that differs from, for example, the radial lock displacement device (34 in Figure 1) and the lock actuators (38 in Figure1 ) described in the previous embodiments. In one embodiment of the invention, the radial lock 222 comprises a structure similar to those shown in Figures 6 and 7. As shown in Figure 17, separate halves 236, 238 of the radial lock 222 may be coupled to radially positioned actuators 240. When the bonnet body 232 is moved into a sealing ongagement with the BOP body 230, the actuators 240 are activated to displace, the. halves 236, 238 of the radial lock 222 in a radially inward direction so that the radial lock 222 engages a groove (244 in Figure 16) formed on an exterior surface (246 in Figure 16) of the bonnet body (232 in Figure 16). The radial lock mechanism (220 in Figure 16) locks the bonnet body (232 in Figure 16) and, therefore, the bonnet door (not shown) and the bonnet assembly (not shown) in place and energizes the high pressure seal (234 in Figure 16). Note that the high pressure seal (234 in Figure 16) may be formed from any of the embodiments shown above (such as the embodiments described with respect to Figures 13-17). Moreover, the radial lock 222 and the groove 244 may comprise angled surfaces (as disclosed in previous embodiments) that produce an axial force that pulls the bonnet body 232 (and the bonnet assembly (not shown) and bonnet door (not shown)) toward the BOP body 230 and further ensure a positive locking engagement.<br>
[00105]	Moreover, as shown in Figure 18, the radial lock 222 may comprise more<br>
than two parts. If a radial lock 250 comprises, for example, four parts 252, 254, 256, 258, an equal number of actuators 240 (e.g., four) may be used to actuate the radial lock 250. Alternatively, fewer actuators 240 (e.g., less than four in the embodiment shown in Figure 18) may be used if an actuator 240 is, for example, coupled to more than one part parts 252, 254, 256, 258 of the radial lock 250. The actuators 240 may be hydraulic actuators or any other type of actuator known in the art. Moreover, the actuators 240 may be disposed within the BOP body (230 in Figure 16) or may be positioned external to the BOP body (230 in Figure 16).  The actuators 240 may be<br>
coupled to the radial lock 250 with, for example, mechanical or hydraulic linkages (not shown). On another embodiment, the radial lock 222 comprises a plurality of dies or dogs (not shown) that are coupled to and activated by a plurality of actuators (not shown).<br>
[00106]	In another embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 19, a radial lock<br>
270 may be formed from a single segment 272. The radial lock 270 is actuated by circumferential actuators 274 coupled to the radial lock 270 and disposed proximate ends 276, 278 of the segment 272. When activated, the circumferential actuators 274 move the ends 276, 278 of the segment 272 towards each other and in a radially inward direction as shown by the arrows in Figure 19. The dashed line in Figure 19 represents an inner surface 277 of the radial lock 270 after actuation. The radial lock 270, when actuated, engages the bonnet body (232 in Figure 16) in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 16.<br>
[00107]	The segment 272 of the radial lock 270 may be produced by forming a<br>
plurality of kerfs 284 proximate the end segments 280, 282. The kerfs 284 may be designed to ease installation of the radial lock 270 in the recess (224 in Figure 16) and to improve flexibility for radial deformation of the radial lock 270. The kerfs may be of any shape known in die art. For example, Figure 20 shows rectangular kerfs 284. However, the kerfs 284 may preferably be formed in a manner that reduces stress concentrations or stress risers at the edges of the kerfs 284. For example, if the kerfs 284 are formal rectangular shapes, stress risers may form at the relatively sharp corners. Accordingly, the kerfs 284 may comprise filleted comers (not shown) or, for example, substantially trapezoidal shapes (not shown) to minimize the effects of stress risav<br>
[00108]	Moreover, the kerfs 284 may be "graduated," as shown in Figure 20, to<br>
produce a substantially smooth transition between relatively stiff straight segments 286 and relatively flexible end segments 280, 282. Graduation of the kerfs 284 effects a smooth stiffness transition that helps prevent stress risers at the last kerf {e.g., at the last kerf proximate the straight segments 286).<br>
[00109]	The radial lock 270 may be formed from a single material or from different<br>
materials (comprising, for example, steel, titanium, beryllium copper, or combinations and/or alloys thereof).   For example, the curved end segments 280,<br>
282 may be formed from a material that is relatively compliant when compared to a relatively rigid material forming the straight segments 286 (e.g., the curved and segments 280, 282 may be formed from a material with an elastic modulus (Ec) that is substantially lower than an elastic modulus (Es) of the straight segments 286). Regardless of the materials used to form the radial lock 270, the radial lock 270 must be flexible enough to permit installation into and removal from the recess (224 in Figure 16).<br>
[00110]	Alternatively, the radial lock 270 of Figure 19 may comprise more than one<br>
segment (e.g., two halves or a plurality of segments) coupled to and actuated by a plurality of circumferential actuators. The radial lock 270 may also comprise a plurality of separate dies or dogs coupled by a flexible band. The dies may be separated by gaps, and the distance of separation may be selected to provide a desired flexibility for the radial lock 270.<br>
[00111]	Figure 21A shows a segmented radial lock that may be radially actuated<br>
relative to a bonnet in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. This embodiment may be referred to as a "spring lock bonnet." In this embodiment, a segmented radial lock 300 may be disposed around a bonnet 302 for securing the bonnet 302 in a BOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 300 may comprise multiple segments (see for example, Figures 6A-6C) disposed around the bonnet 302. In one embodiment, the segmented radial lock 300 comprises at least eight segments. Each segment of the segmented radial lock 300 may be biased towards a locked (i.e., outward) position by at least one spring 308. As used herein, a "spring" refers to any biasing member, such as a helical spring, a Belleville washer, or elastomer that provides a spring force. Each segment of the segmented radial lock 300 may be axially held in place by a manual lock, for example, a retaining screw 310 or a pin.<br>
[00112]	To lock the bonnet 302, the bonnet 302 may be inserted into an opening 304<br>
of the BOP body 306. As the bonnet 302 is inserted in the BOP body 306, the segmented radial lock 300 contnets a chamfer 312 on the opening 304 of the BOP body 306, thereby pushing each segment of the segmented radial lock 300 radially-inward and compressing the spring 308, Once the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 moves axially into BOP' body 306 and adjacent a corresponding radial lock 314 in the BOP body 306, the segments of the segmented radial lock 300 are extended radially outward by the.', spring 308 and into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 314 in theHOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 300 is then said to be in a "locked position."<br>
(00113]	To prevent the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 from moving<br>
radially inward into an "unlocked position," a backup sleeve 316 may be actuated such that at least a portion 318 of the backup sleeve 316 is positioned radially inward of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302. When the backup sleeve 316 is in place, the segments of the segmented radial lock 300 are unable to be actuated radially inward, thereby securing the bonnet 302 within the BOP body 306.<br>
[00114]	A bonnet seal 322 may be disposed on a seal carrier 324 of the bonnet 302.<br>
When the bonnet 302 is inserted in the opening 304 of the BOP body 306, the bonnet seal 322 contacts a seal bore 326 inside the BOP body 306. The bonnet seal 322 comprises a high pressure seal that prevents fluids from the internal bore 330 of the BOP body 306 from escaping. In one embodiment, the bonnet seal 322 may comprise at least one o-ring 332. In this embodiment, the o-ring 332. The bonnet seal 322 may further include a second o-ring 334 to provide a redundant seal. Those having ordinary skill will appreciate that the bonnet seal 322 is not limited to a particular type of seal. For example, in one embodiment, the bonnet seal 322 may comprise chevron seals.<br>
[00115]	In order to service the ram assembly, including a piston 328, the bonnet 302<br>
may be unlocked by removing the backup sleeve 316 and then moving the bonnet 302 axially away from the BOP body 306. As the bonnet 302 is moved away from the BOP body 306, the segments of the segmented radial lock 300 are moved radially inward by surfaces 320 of the corresponding radial lock 314 in the BOP body 306, thereby allowing disengagement of the bonnet 302 from the BOP body 306.<br>
[00116]	Figure 21B shows another embodiment of a segmented radial lock 300 in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the segmented radial lock 300 may be disposed around a bonnel 302 for securing the bonnet 302 in a BOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 300 may comprise multiple segments (see for example, Figures 6A-6C) disposed around the bonnet<br>
302. In one embodiment, the segmented radial lock 300 comprises at least eight segments. Each segment of the segmented radial lock 300 may be biased towards an unlocked (i.e., inward) position by a spring 308, for example, a helical spring, Belleville washer, or elastomer. Each segment of the segmented radial lock 300 may be axially held in place by a manual lock, for example, a retaining screw 310 or a pin.<br>
[00117]	Once the bonnet 302 i.s positioned in place in the BOP body 306, the<br>
segments of the segmented radial lock 300 are adjacent a corresponding radial lock 314 in the BOP body 306. A segmented actuator sleeve 317 comprising at least two segments, or independent actualling members, is disposed around the bonnet, wherein a first actuating member314 and n second actuating member 336 may be actuated independently of each orher.  In move axially along the bonnet 302. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may comprise more than two actuating members so long as each actuating member may be independently actuated.<br>
[00118]	As shown in Figure 21B, the first actuating member 334 is configured to<br>
move axially along the bonnet 302 into a position wherein at least a portion 319 of the first actuating member 334 is positioned radially inward of at least a first segment 323 of the segmented radial lock 300. The second actuating member 336 is configured to move, independent of the first actuating member 334, axially along the bonnet 302 into a position wherein at least a portion 318 of the second actuating member 336 is positioned radially inward of at least a second segment 325 of the segmented radial lock 300. At least two powered actuators (not shown) may be used to independently actuate the first actuating member 334 and the second actuating member 336. As the first actuating member 334 is moved into position, a portion 319 of the first actuating member 334, for example a chamfer 338. radially outwardly extends the at least a first segment of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306. As the second actuating member 336 is moved into position, a portion 318 of the second actuating member 336, for example a chamfer 338. radially outwardly extends the at least a second segment of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306.<br>
[00119]	In one embodiment, the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may be split along a<br>
diagonal plane, thereby defining a first actuating member 334 and a second actuating member 336. In this embodiment, the first actuating member 334 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate upper segments and half of the side segments of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 and the second actuating member 336 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate lower segments and half of the side segments of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302. In another embodiment, the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may be split along a vertical plane. In this embodiment, the first actuating member 334 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate segments of the segmented radial lock 300 disposed on one side of the vertical plane, for example, on a left side, and the second actuating member 336 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate segments of the segmented radial lock 300 disposed on an opposite side of the vertical plane, for example, on a right side. In yet another embodiment, the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may be split along a horizontal plane. In this embodiment, the first actuating member 334 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate segments of the segmented radial lock 300 on one side of the horizontal plnne, for example, on a top side, and the second actuating member 336 of the segmented actuator sleeve 317 may actuate segments of the radial lock 300 disposed on mi opposite side of the horizontal plane, for example on a bottom side.<br>
[00120]	The position of the first urinating member 334 and the second actuating<br>
member 336 of the segmented actuator .sleeve 317 may also prevent the segmented radial lock 300 from moving axially along the bonnet 302 towards the opening 304 of the BOP body 306, or unlocking, us a result of internal pressure in the BOP body 306. When the first actuator sleeve 331 and the second actuator sleeve 336 is in place, the segments of the segmented radial lock 300 are unable to be actuated radially inward, thereby securing the bonnet 302 within the BOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 300 is then said to be in a locked position.<br>
[00121]	In order to service the ram assembly, including a piston 328. the bonnet 302<br>
may be unlocked by removing the segmented actuator sleeve 317 and then moving the bonnet 302 axially away from the BOP body 306. When the segmented actuator sleeve 317 is removed, the upper and side segments of the segmented radial lock 350, as a result of the bias of the spring 308, return to an unlocked position, or move<br>
radially inward, thereby allowing disengagement of the bonnet 302 from the BOP body 306.<br>
[00122]	Figures 22A and 22B show a radial lock in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. In this embodiment, a segmented radial lock 350 may be disposed around a bonnet 302 for securing the bonnet 302 in a BOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 350 may comprise multiple segments (see for example, Figures 6A-6C) disposed around the bonnet 302. In one embodiment, the segmented radial lock 350 comprises at least eight segments. The segments of the segmented radial lock 350 may be axially held in place by a manual lock, for example, a retaining screw 310 or a pin. In this embodiment, at least one segment of the segmented radial lock 350 may be extended radially outward by gravity. In one embodiment, at least one segment of the segmented radial lock 350 may be biased towards an unlocked position. In another embodiment, at least one segment of the segmented radial lock 350 may be biased towards an unlocked position.<br>
[00123]	In one embodiment, at least one lower segment of the segmented radial lock<br>
350 may be extended radially outward by gravity. Figure 22B shows a lower segment 351 of the segmented radial lock 350 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The lower segment 351 of the segmented radial lock 350 may be extended radially outward by gravity, that is, the lower segment 351 of the segmented radial lock 350 may drop radially outward (i.e., downward). This embodiment may be referred to as a '"hanging lock bonnet." Once the bonnet 302 is inserted in the opening 304 of the BOP body and the segmented radial lock 350 is adjacent and radially inward of the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306, the lower segment 351 of the segmented radial lock 350 will drop into engagement with the coiTesponding radial lock 3 14 of the BOP body 306. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that more than one lower segment of the segmented radial lock 350 may be configured to extend radially outward by gravity and into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 3 14 of the BOP body 306.<br>
[00124]	In this embodiment, at least one segment of the segmented radial lock 350,<br>
may be biased towards an unlocked (i.e.. inward) position by a spring 308, as shown in Figure 22B. Alternatively, at least one segment of the segmented radial lock 350, may be biased towards a locked (i.e. outwords) position by a spring 308. In one embodiment, the at least one segmrnl ol the segmented radial lock 350 that may be<br>
biased towards a locked or unlocked position may be at least one upper segment 352, a side segment, or any combination of segments of the segmented radial lock 350 thereof. Once the bonnet 302 is positioned in place in the BOP body 306, at least one upper segment or at leant one side segments of the segmented radial lock 350 is positioned adjacent a corresponding radial lock 314 in the BOP body 306 and at least one lower segment of the segmented radial lock 350 drops into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 3 14 in the BOP body 306.<br>
[00125]	In one embodiment, a backup sleeve 316 may be actuated to move axially<br>
along the bonnet 302 into a position, wherein at least a portion 318 of the backup sleeve 316 is positioned radially inward of the segmented radial lock 350. In one embodiment, as the backup sleeve 3 16 is moved into position, the at least a portion 318 of the backup sleeve may extend upper and side segments of the segmented radial lock 350 radially outwardly into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306. In another embodiment, as the backup sleeve 316 is moved into position, the at least a portion 318 of the backup sleeve 316 is positioned radially inward of at least one segment biased toward the locked position of the radial lock 350, thereby preventing the at least one segment to be actuated radially inward.<br>
[00126]	In one embodiment, the backup  sleeve 316  may comprise at least two<br>
sections, for example, the backup sleeve 316 may comprise an upper section 334 (Figure 22B) and a lower section 336 (Figure 22A). As the backup sleeve 316 is moved into position, a chamfer 338 of the upper section 334 of backup sleeve 316 extends segments biased towards an unlocked position of the segmented radial lock 350 on the bonnet 302 radially outwardly into engagement with the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306. In one embodiment, the upper section 334 of the backup sleeve 316 may actuate the upper segments and the side segments biased towards the unlocked position of the segmented radial lock 350 on the bonnet 302. In another embodiment, the upper section 334 may secure upper and side segments biased towards a locked position of the segmented radial lock 350 on the bonnet 302. The lower section 336 of the backup sleeve 3 16 may secure the engagement of lower segments of the segmented radial lock 300 on the bonnet 302 with the corresponding radial lock 314 of the BOP body 306. The position of the backup sleeve 316 may also prevent the segmented radial lock 350 from moving axiallyalong the bonnet 302 towards the opening 304 of the BOP body 306, or unlocking, as a result of internal pressure in the BOP body 306. When the backup sleeve 316 is in place, the segments of the segmented radial lock 350 are unable to be actuated radially inward, thereby securing the bonnet 302 within the BOP body 306. The segmented radial lock 350 is then said to be in a locked position.<br>
[00127J	In order to service the ram assembly, including a piston 328, the bonnet 302<br>
may be unlocked by removing the backup sleeve 316 and then pulling on the bonnet 302 axially away from the BOP body 306. When the backup sleeve 316 is removed, the upper and side segments of the .segmented radial lock 350, as a result of the bias of the spring 308, return to an unlucked position, or move radially inward. As the bonnet 302 is pulled away from the HOP body 306, the lower segments of the segmented radial lock 350 are moved radially inward by surfaces 320 of the corresponding radial lock 314 in the BOP body 306, thereby allowing disengagement of the bonnet 302 from the BOP body 306.<br>
Swivel Slide Mount for Bonnet Assemblies<br>
[00128]	Referring again to Figure 1, another important aspect of the invention is the<br>
swivel slide mounts 74 cooperatively attached to the rods 70 and to each of the bonnet assemblies 14. As described previously herein, the bonnet assemblies 14 are coupled to the swivel slide mounts 74. and the swivel slide mounts 74 are slidably engaged with the rods 70. The swivel slide mounts 74 are adapted to allow the bonnet assemblies 14 to rotate proximate their axial centeiiines so that the rams (not shown) and the interior components of both the bonnet assemblies 14 and the BOP body 12 may be accessed for maintenance, to change the rams. etc.<br>
[00129]	An embodiment of the swivel slide mount 74 is shown in Figures 23 and 24.<br>
The swivel slide mount 74 comprises a swivel slide mounting bar 76 and a swivel plate 78. The swivel slide mounting bar 76 is slidably attached to the rods 70. The slidable attachment between the swivel slide mounting bar 76 and the rods 70 may be made with, for example, linear bearings 87 that are coupled to the swivel slide mounting bar 76. However, other slidable attachments known in the art may be used with the invention to form the slideable attachment. Moreover, bushings (not shown), or a combination of linear bearings 87 and bushings (not shown) may be used with the invention.   The swivel plate 78 is rotationally attached to the swivel slide mounting bar 16 and is cooperatively attached to an upper surface 75 of the bonnet assembly 14. The cooperative attachment of the swivel slide mount 74 to the bonnet assembly 14 is made substantially at an axial centerline of the bonnet assembly 14.<br>
[00130]	The rods 70 are designed to be of sufficient length to permit the bonnet<br>
assembly 14 to disengage from the BOP body 12 and slide away from the BOP body 12 until the ram (not shown) is completely outside the side passage 20. Moreover, a point of attachment 82 where the swivel slide mount 74 is cooperatively attached to the upper surface 75 of the bonnet assembly 14 may be optimized so that the point of attachment 82 is substantially near a center of mass of the bonnet assembly 14. Positioning the point of attachment 82 substantially near the center of mass reduces the force required to rotate the bonnet assembly 14 and also reduces the bending stress experienced by the swivel plate 78.<br>
[00131]	The swivel plate 78 may further include a bearing 85.   For example, the<br>
bearing 85 may be cooperatively attached to the swivel slide mounting bar 76 and adapted to withstand both radial and thrust loads generated by the rotation of the bonnet assembly 14. The bearing 85 may comprise, for example, a combination radial bearing and thrust bearing (such as, For example, a tapered roller bearing). Alternatively, the bearing 85 may comprise, for example, a roller bearing to support radial loads and a thrust washer to support axial loads. However, otlier types of bearing arrangements are known in the art and may be used with the swivel plate 78.<br>
[00132]	When the ram (not shown) is completely out of the side passage 20, the<br>
bonnet assembly 14 can rotate about a  ratational axis of the swivel plate 78 so that the ram (not shown) and the side passage20 may be accessed for maintenance, inspection, and the like. In the embodiment shown in Figures 23 and 24, the lower bonnet assembly 14 is shown to the minted approximately 90 degrees with respect to the BOP body 12 while the upper bonnet assembly 14 remains in locking engagement with the BOP body 12. A ram block attachment point 80 is clearly visible.<br>
[00133]	Figure 25  shows a top  view of the  BOP   10 when one of the bonnet<br>
assemblies 14 has been disengaged from the BOP body 12 and rotated approximately 90 degrees.   As shown, the rum block attachment point 80 is clearly<br>
visible and may be vertically accessed. Vertical access is a significant advantage because prior art bonnets that include hinges generally pivot about an edge of the bonnet door. Therefore, if, for example, a lower BOP bonnet was unbolted and pivoted open, the ram could not be vertically accessed because the body of the upper BOP bonnet was in the way. Vertical access to the ram is important because it makes it much easier to maintain or replace rams, thus reducing the time required to maintain the BOP and increasing the level of safety of the personnel performing the maintenance. Further, vertical access enables, for example, maintenance of a lower BOP bonnet while an upper bonnet is locked in position (see, for example, Figures 23-25).<br>
[00134]	The bonnet assembly 14 may also be rotated approximately 90 degrees in the<br>
other direction with respect to an axis of the side passage (20 in Figure 1), thereby permitting approximately 180 degrees of rotation. However, other embodiment may be designed that permit rotation of greater than or less than 180 degrees. The range of rotation of the swivel slide mount 74 is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
[0013S]	The swivel slide mount 74 is advantageous because of the simplicity of the<br>
design and attachment to the bonnet assembly 14. For example, prior art hinges are generally complex, difficult to manufacture, and relatively expensive. Further, prior art hinges have to be robust because they carry the full weight of the BOP bonnet about a vertical axis positioned some distance away from the center of mass of the bonnet. The bending moment exerted on the hinge is, as a result, very high and deformation of the hinge can lead to ""sagging" of the bonnet.<br>
[00136]	Figures 26-31 show embodiments of a BOP bonnet mount according to the<br>
invention. In each of the embodiments, the mount is arranged so that the BOP bonnet can be disengaged from the BOP body and moved away from the BOP body in a direction substantially normal to a face of the BOP body so that the ram is clear of the opening. Once the ram is clear, the bonnet may be pivoted, swiveled, or moved to allow easier access to the' ram. "Substantially normal" is used to indicated a direction away from the BOP unci the lace where the side opening is located. Those having skill in the art will realized that the exact direction will depend on the construction of the BOP, the bound, and Ihe side opening, but the direction will generally be normal to a face of the HOP body.<br>
[00137]	Figure 26 shows one embodiment ol n BOP bonnet mount 602 according to<br>
one aspect of the invention. A BOP 601 has a BOP body 603 that has four side openings, for example, side opening 650. Four BOP bonnets 611, 612, 613, and 614 may be adapted to be coupled to the side openings. For example, Figure 26 shows BOP bonnet 612 adapted to be coupled to the BOP body 603 at a side opening 650.<br>
[00138]	A BOP bonnet mount 602 is also shown in Figure 26.   The BOP bonnet<br>
mount 602 comprises two support members 621, 622 and bonnet mounting member 628. The BOP mount 602 enables the BOP bonnet 612 to be moved away from the BOP body 603 in a direction substantially nonnal to the face 655 of the BOP body 603, and then swiveled so that the ram (not shown) can be more easily replaced.<br>
[00139]	The support members 621, 622 shown in Figure 26 are coupled to the BOP<br>
body 603. The support members 621, 622 may also be adapted to allow wheels to roll across the top of the support members 621, 622. The support members 621, 622 extend enough distance from the BOP body 603 so that the BOP bonnet 612 may be moved away from the BOP body 603 so that the ram (not shown) is clear of the BOP body 603 and the side opening 650. In this disclosure, "clear" of the BOP body or the side opening means removed to a sufficient extent to that the bonnet may rotate without causing contact between the ram block and the BOP body.<br>
[00140]	The bonnet mounting member 628 may comprise two wheel blocks 624,<br>
626, and a swivel plate 630. One wheel block is disposed at each end of the bonnet mounting member 628. Each wheel block 624, 626 includes at least one wheel positioned to roll on lop of a support member (621 or 622). In the embodiment shown in Figure 26, each wheel block 624, 626 includes two wheels, although different numbers of wheels can be used without departing from the spirit the invention.<br>
[00141]	A swivel plate 630 may be rotationaily attached to the bonnet mounting<br>
member 628 and coupled to the bonnet 612. In some embodiments, the swivel plate 630 is rotationaily coupled to the bonnet mounting member 628 near a center of the bonnet mounting member 628. In some other embodiments, the swivel plate 630 is coupled to the bonnet 612 above a center of mass of the bonnet 612. In some embodiments, the swivel plate 630 may be fixedly coupled to the bonnet mounting member 628 and rotationaily coupled to the bonnet 612.<br>
100142J	A bonnet mount 602 according to the embodiment shown in Figure 26<br>
enables easier inspection and replacement of a ram (not shown) disposed on the end of a ram piston 651. The bonnet 612 is first disengaged from the BOP body 603. The method of engagement and disengagement of the bonnet is not part of the invention and the invention is not limited by such methods. Next, the bonnet 612 is moved away from the BOP body 603 in a direction substantially normal to a face 655 of the BOP body 603. The bonnet 612 is coupled to the bonnet mounting member 628, and wheels on the bonnet mounting member 628 enable the bonnet 612 to move away from the BOP body 603. Once the ram (not shown) is clear of the side opening 650, the bonnet 612 may be swiveled to either side so that the ram (not shown) can be inspected or replaced.<br>
[00143)	The embodiment shown In Figure 26 includes two support members.   It is<br>
understood that only one suppoil member, or more than two support members, could be used without departing from the spirit of the invention. Similarly, many of the embodiments described with reference to Figures 27A-31B include two support members. Again, it is understood Unit only one support member, or more than two support members, may be used without departing form the spirit of the invention.<br>
(00144J	Figure 26 shows three additional bonnets 611, 613, and 614.  The operation<br>
of the bonnet mounts associated with these bonnets is similar to the one described above. Accordingly, their operation will not be individually described. Further, the embodiments in Figures 27A-32 show only one bonnet and the associated bonnet mount It is understood that each embodiment can be used with any number of bonnets on a BOP. Also, with each aspect of the invention, it is desirable to make any couplings with the bonnet near its center of mass or along a center axis. While it may not be mentioned specifically with certain embodiments of the invention, embodiments may include such a coupling.<br>
[00145]	Figure 27A shows a top view of a bonnet mount 701  according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. A bonnet 605 is shown withdrawn from a BOP body 603 so that a ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603. The bonnet 605 is coupled to a bonnet mounting member 703 that is moveably coupled to two support members 711,712. The bonnet mounting member 703 ismoveably coupled to the support members 71 1, 712 by two side blocks 706, 707.   The side blocks 706, 707<br>
 <br>
may comprise linear bearings (as shown in Figure 23), wheel blocks (as shown in Figure 26), or any other suitable coupling that enables the bonnet 605 and the bonnet mounting member 703 to be moved away from the BOP body 603 in a direction substantially normal to a face of the BOP body 603.<br>
[00146]	The bonnet 605 may be rigidly fixed to the bonnet mounting member 703 by<br>
a bonnet connector 705. Alternately, the bonnet 605 may be rotationally coupled to the bonnet mounting member 703 by a swivel plate, as described above with reference to Figures 23 and 26.<br>
[00147]	The support members 711, 712 may be hingedly coupled to the BOP body<br>
603. Figure 27A shows support member 711 hingedly coupled to the BOP body 603 by a hinge 708. Likewise, support member 712 is shown hingedly coupled to the BOP body by hinge 709. The hinges 708, 709 enable the support members 711,712 to be pivoted so the bonnet moves in a horizontal direction.<br>
[00148j	Figure 27B shows a side view of a bonnet mount 701 according to this aspect<br>
of the invention. The bonnet 605 is suspended from the support members 711, 712 (only support member 711 is shown in the side view of Figure 27B). The bonnet mounting member 703 is rotationally coupled to each of the side blocks 706, 707 (only side block 707 is shown in the side view of Figure 27B). Figure 27B shows side block 707 rotationally coupled to the bonnet support member 703 at pivot point 715. Although it is not shown in Figure 27B, it is understood that the bonnet mounting member 703 is similarly ccoupled in side block 706.<br>
[00149]	Figure 27C shows is a top view of the bonnet mount 701 with the support<br>
members 711,712 pivoted to one sale so that the ram block 607 is more accessible for inspection and replacement. The support members 711, 712 pivot at the points where they are hingedly coupled to the BOP body 603. In the embodiment shown in Figure 27C. support member 711 is coupled to the BOP body by a hinge 708, and support member 712 is coupled to the BOP body by a hinge 709. The hinged couplings 708, 709 and the rotational couplings of the side blocks 706, 707 enable the bonnet 605 to be horizontally swung away from the BOP body 603 so that the ram block 607 is easily accessible.<br>
J00150]	The embodiment shown in Figures 27A-27C includes a bonnet mount that<br>
enables the bonnet to be moved horizontally.  In some embodiments (not shown), a<br>
bonnet mount may enable the vertical movement of the bonnet. In such an embodiment, the support members could be hingedly coupled to the BOP body so that they pivot in an up or down direction. This would be advantageous, for example, if the ram block could be more easily inspected or replaced from above or below the BOP.<br>
[00151]	Figures 28A-28D show a bonnet mount 801 according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention. A bonnet 605 is coupled to a BOP body 603 so that the bonnet 605 can be moved away from the BOP body 603 substantially normal to a face of the BOP body 603. Once the ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603, the bonnet 605 is able to rotate in the vertical plane so that the bonnet 603 is facing the other direction.<br>
[00152]	Figure 28A shows a top view of a bonnet mount 801  according to this<br>
embodiment of the invention. The bonnet 605 may be coupled to the BOP body 603 by two support members 807, 808, two movement blocks 803, 805, and two bonnet rotational members 810, 811.<br>
[00153]	The support members 807, 808 are coupled to the BOP body 603 by any<br>
means known in the art. In some embodiments, the support members 807, 808 are fixedly coupled to the BOP body 603. Movement block 803 is movably coupled to support member 807, and movement block 805 is moveably coupled to support member 808. The movement blocks 803, 805 are adapted to move along the length of the support members.<br>
[00154]	in some embodiments, the support members 807, 808 comprise support rods,<br>
and the movement blocks 803, 805 comprise linear bearings or bushings that are adapted to slide along the length of the support rods. In another embodiments, the movement blocks 803, 805 each comprise at least one wheel and the support members 807, 808 are adapted to have the at least one wheel roll along the top of the support members 807, 808.<br>
[00155]	The bonnet 605 may be coupled to the movement blocks 803, 805 by two<br>
rotational members 810, 811. Rotational member 810 is coupled to the bonnet 605 and to movement block 803. The second rotational member 811 is coupled to another side of the bonnet 605 and to movement block 805. The rotational members 810, 811 are coupled in such a wny as to unable the bonnet 605 to rotate about a horizontal axis. This may be incomplished  by fixedly coupling the rotational members 810, 811 to the bonnol 605and ratationally coupling the rotational members 810, 813 to the movement blocks 803, 805. Conversely, the rotational members 810, 811 could be fixedly coupled to the movement blocks 803, 805 and rotationally coupled to the bonriel 605. Other means of moveably and rotationally coupling a bonnet to support members can be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, all couplings may be rotational couplings.<br>
[00156]	Figure 28B shows a side view of a bonnet mount 801  according to the<br>
embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 28 A. The support members 807, 808 (only support member 807 is shown in the side view of Figure 28B) may be aligned with the horizontal axis of the bonnet 603. The movement blocks 803, 805 (only movement block 803 is shown in the side view of Figure 28B) and the rotational members (810 and 811 in Figure 28A) may be aligned near the center of mass of the bonnet 603.<br>
[00157]	Figure 28C shows a top view of a bonnet mount 801   according to the<br>
embodiment of the invention shown in Figures 28A and 28B. The bonnet 605 is rotated 180° in the vertical plane so that the ram block 607 is facing away from the BOP body 603. In this position, the ram block 607 may be accessed for inspection and replacement.<br>
[00158{	Figure 28D shows a side view of the bonnet mount 801 with the bonnet 605<br>
rotated so that the ram block 607 is facing away from the BOP body 603. The bonnet may rotate from the initial position (as shown in Figure 28B) in either direction. In some embodiments, the bonnet mount 801 may comprise a lock mechanism that may lock the bonnet 605 in position to be coupled with a side opening 650 in the BOP body 603 or in a 1 80" rotated position for inspection and replacement. Also, a bonnet mount 801 according to this aspect of the invention may have a lock mechanism that is adapted to lock the bonnet in a 90° position, i.e., with the ram block 607 pointing either up or down. Such a position would be desirable, for example, if conditions made inspecting a ram block 607 from above or below advantageous.<br>
[00J59]	Figures 29A-29D show a bonnet mount 901 according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention.  A bonnet 605 is coupled to a BOP body 603 by at least three support<br>
members 911, 912, 913, at least two of which 911, 912 are hingedly coupled to the BOP body 605.<br>
[00160]	Figure 29A shows a top view of a bonnet mount 901  according to this<br>
embodiment of the invention. A bonnet 605 is shown engaged with a BOP body 603, and a ram block 607 is shown located within the BOP body 603. The bonnet 605 is coupled to the BOP body 603 by a bonnet mounting member 915, a vertical bonnet support member 921, and three support members 911, 912, 913 (support member 912 is not shown in the top view of figure 29A; see Figures 29B and 29C).<br>
[00161]	Figure 29B shows an end view of a bonnet mounting member 901.   The<br>
bonnet 605 is coupled to the bonnet mounting member 915 by a bonnet support plate 919. In some embodiments, the bonnel support plate 919 comprises a fixed coupling, although the bonnet support plate 919 may comprise a rotational coupling without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
[00162]	The bonnet mounting member 915, on one side, is coupled to the vertical<br>
bonnet support member 921. On the oilier side, the bonnet mounting member 915 is coupled to the movement block 917. The bonnet mounting member 915 is shown suspended from the movement block 917, but other coupling types may be used in embodiments of the invention.<br>
[00163]	Still referring to Figure 29B, support members 911 and 912 are coupled to<br>
the BOP body 603 on one side of the side opening 650, and support member 913 is coupled to the BOP body 603 on the opposing side of the side opening 650. The vertical bonnet support member 921 is inovably coupled to support member 911 near the top of the vertical bonnet support member 921, and the vertical bonnet support member 921 is moveably coupled to support member 912 near the bottom of the vertical bonnet support member 921. The movement block 917 is moveably coupled to support member 913.<br>
[00164]	As can be seen in Figures 29A and 29D, the support members may be of<br>
different lengths. Support members 911 and 912 have sufficient length so that the bonnet 605 can be moved substantially normal to a face of the BOP body 603 so that the ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603. Side support member 913, on the other hand, may have a length selected so that as the bonnet 605 is moved away from the BOP body 603, the movement block 917 moves past the end of support<br>
member 913. In doing so, the movement block 917 becomes decoupled from side support member 913.<br>
[00165]	Support members 911, 912 may be hingedly coupled to the BOP body 603.<br>
As shown in Figures 29A and 29D, support member 911 is hingedly coupled to the BOP body 603. The hinged coupling may comprise a hinge 923. Likewise, support member 912, as seen in Figure 29C, is hingedly coupled to the BOP body 603. The coupling may comprise a hinge 924.<br>
[00166|	Once the movement block 917 becomes decoupled from support member<br>
913, as can be seen in Figure 29D, the remaining support members 911, 912 and the bonnet 605 are free to pivot away from the BOP body 603. In some embodiments, the bonnet mount 901 includes stops (not shown) that prevent the support members 911 and 912 and the bonnet 605 from rotating past a selected position. By pivoting about the hinged couplings of support members 911 and 912, the ram block 607 becomes more accessible for inspection and replacement.<br>
[00167]	To replace the bonnet to the engaged position, as shown in Figure 29A, the<br>
bonnet 605 may be pivoted back toward the BOP body 603. In some embodiments, the bonnet mount 901 includes stops that prevent the support members 911 and 912 and the bonnet from pivoting pas! the aligned position. The movement block 917 may then be recoupled with support member 913, and the bonnet 605 may be moved toward the BOP body 603 substantially parallel to the axis of the side opening 650.<br>
[00168]	It is noted that the bonnet mount 901 according to this embodiment of the<br>
invention may not include a thud snppoil member 913. In that case, the bonnet mounting member 915 would not be coupled with any support member. The bonnet 605 could be moved away from the BOP body 603 and then pivoted once the ram block 607 was clear of the BOP body 603.<br>
[00169]	Figure 30A-30C show a tin ee- pi vol hinge bonnet mount 1001 according to<br>
an embodiment of the invention. A three-pivot hinge bonnet mount 1001 enables the bonnet 605 to be moved away from a BOP body 603 in a direction substantially normal to a face of the BOP body 603 so that a ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603.<br>
[00170]	Figure 30A shows a top view of a bonnet 605 engaged with a BOP body 603.<br>
The ram block 607 is disposed within the BOP body 603.   The bonnet 605 is also<br>
coupled to the BOP body 603 by a three-pivot hinge bonnet mount 1001. A three-pivot hinge bonnet mount 1001 according to this embodiment of the invention may include two hinge members 1015, 1017 and three pivot points 1021, 1022, 1023.<br>
[00171]	A first hinge member 1015 may be hingedly coupled to the bonnet 605 at a<br>
bonnet hinge connector 1013. The bonnet coupling may comprise a hinge 1023. A second hinge member may be hingedly coupled to BOP body 603 at a BOP hinge connector 1011. The BOP hinge coupling may comprise a hinge 1021. The first hinge member 1015 and the second hinge member 1017 may be hingedly coupled to each other, each at an opposite end from their coupling to the bonnet 605 and the BOP body 603, respectively. The coupling between the first hinge member 1015 and the second hinge member 1017 hinge members may also be a hinge 1022.<br>
[00172]	As shown in Figure 30A, when the bonnet 605 is engaged with the BOP<br>
body 603, the hinge members 1015, 1017 form an angle. This enables the bonnet 605 to be moved away from the. BOP body 602 substantially normal to a face of the BOP body 603. Figure 30B shows the bonnet 605 moved away from the BOP body 603 so that the ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603. When the bonnet is moved away from the BOP body 603, the hinge members 1015, 1017 may form a straight line between hinges 1021 and 1023. With the ram block 607 clear of the BOP body 603, the bonnet 605 can be pivoted away from the BOP body 603 at any of the hinges 1021, 1022, 1023. Figure 30C shows a top view of a bonnet 605 pivoted away from a BOP body 603 by pivoting about hinge 1021.<br>
[00173]	In one or more embodiments (not shown), the hinge bonnet mount may<br>
comprise a single member hingedly coupled to a BOP body and to a bonnet. The single member may be linearly extendable so that the bonnet can be moved away from the BOP body along an axis of a side opening. Once moved away, the bonnet could be pivoted away from the BOP body at either of the hinged couplings.<br>
[00174]	Figure 31A  and  31B show  a  bonnet mount   1101   according to another<br>
embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment shown, support members 1109, 1111 are moveably coupled to the HOP body 603 and may be fixedly coupled to the bonnet 605.<br>
[00175]	Figure 31A shows a top view of an embodiment of a bonnet mount 1101<br>
according to the invention.   The hound 60S may be coupled to a bonnet mounting<br>
member 1103 at a connection point 1117. It) some embodiments, the bonnet 605 is rotationally coupled to the bonnet amounting member 1103. In one embodiment, the connection point 1117 comprises H swivel plate.<br>
[00176]	The bonnet mounting member  1103 may be coupled to support members<br>
1109, 1111 at opposite ends of the bonnet mounting member 1103. An end block 1107 may be included at one end of the bonnet mounting member 1103. The end block 1107 maybe coupled to support member 1109. A second end block 1105 may be included at a second end of the bonnet mounting member 1103. The second end block 1105 may be coupled to support member 1111. In some embodiments, the bonnet mounting member 1103 may be fixedly coupled to the support members 1109,1111.<br>
[00177]	The support members 1 109,  1111  may be moveably coupled to the BOP<br>
body 603. The BOP body 603 may include support blocks 1113, 1115, which may be moveably coupled to the support members 1109, 1111. In one embodiment, the support blocks 1113, 1115 include linear bearings and adapted to allow the support members 1109, 1111 to slide in and out of the support blocks 1113, 1115.<br>
[00178]	Figure 31B shows a bonnet mount ! 101  with the bonnet 605 moved away<br>
from the BOP body and the ram block 607 clear of the BOP body 603. The support members 1109, 1111 have been moved along with the bonnet 605, in relation to the BOP body 603. In some embodiments, the bonnet 605 is rotationally coupled to the bonnet mounting member 1103 and may be swiveled once the ram block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603.<br>
[00179]	Advantageously,  a  bonnet  mount   according to  this  embodiment of the<br>
invention need not have support members that extend past the bonnet, even when the bonnet is engaged with the BOP body. A mount according to this embodiment requires less space when the bonnet is engaged with the BOP body because the support members do not extend past the bonnet.<br>
[00180]	Figure 32 shows a side view of an embodiment of a bonnet mount 1201<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the support members are not coupled to the BOP body 603. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments described herein may be applicable is situations where the support members are not coupled to the BOP body 603.<br>
{00181]	A bonnet 605 is shown moved away from a BOP body 603 so that a ram<br>
block 607 is clear of the BOP body 603. The bonnet 605 may be coupled to a vertical support member 1207. In some embodiments, the vertical support member 1207 is rotationally coupled to the bonnet 605 at a rotation point 1209. Rotating the bonnet 605 enables easier access to the ram 607. In other embodiments, the vertical support member 1207 is releasably coupled to the bonnet 605. When the vertical support member 1207 is releasably coupled to the bonnet 605, the vertical support member 1207 may be decoupled from the bonnet 605 and may be used in connection with another bonnet (nni shown).<br>
[00182]	A support member 1203 may be. positioned near the bonnet 605 so that the<br>
vertical support member 1207 can be coupled to the support member 1203. In some embodiments, the vertical support member 1207 includes at least one wheel 1205 that is adapted to roll along the ,supporl member 1203. In some embodiments, the support member 1203 is a rail.<br>
[00183]	The support member 1203 may be supported by any means known in the art.<br>
The means of support for the support member 1203 is not intended to limit the invention. As an example, Figure 32 shows the support member 1203 connected to a support brace 1213 and a BOP stack frame 1215.<br>
[00184]	Advantageously, embodiment of the present invention may provide a more<br>
secure bonnet locking apparatus. Additionally, embodiments may allow for easier maintenance of a BOP and easier replacement of rams. Embodiments of the present invention may reduce the time required to maintain the BOP and increase the level of safety of personnel performing the maintenance.<br>
