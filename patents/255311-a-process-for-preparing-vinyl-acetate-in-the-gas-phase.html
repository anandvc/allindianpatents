				<td>Catalyst, process for producing the catalyst and<br>
process for preparing vinyl acetate using the catalyst<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst comprising<br>
palladium and/or its compounds, gold and/or its<br>
compounds and also at least one alkali metal compound,<br>
a process for producing it and its use for preparing<br>
vinyl acetate in the gas phase from acetic acid,<br>
ethylene and oxygen or oxygen-containing gases.<br>
It is known from the prior art that vinyl acetate can<br>
be prepared in the gas phase from ethylene, oxygen and<br>
acetic acid in the presence of catalysts which comprise<br>
palladium, gold and alkali metal compounds on a porous<br>
support material (such as[ silicon dioxide) .<br>
The distribution of the noble metals on the support<br>
material is of particular importance for the activity<br>
and selectivity of these catalysts. Since the reactants<br>
in the reaction to be catalyzed cannot readily diffuse<br>
into the intermediate or inner regions of the porous<br>
support material, the reaction takes place essentially<br>
only on the outermost or surface regions of the<br>
catalyst. Thus, the metal components present in the<br>
interior or in the intermediate regions of the support<br>
do not contribute significantly to the reaction<br>
mechanism, which leads to a reduction in productivity<br>
of the catalyst based on the weight of the noble<br>
metals.<br>
In the development of effective catalysts for vinyl<br>
acetate production, efforts have therefore been<br>
directed at providing catalysis in which the<br>
catalytically active noble metals are present in a<br>
shell on the support particles while the core of the<br>
support particles is largely free of noble metals. Such<br>
catalysts can in principle be produced by impregnation<br>
of the support material with soluble noble metal<br>
compounds, subsequent precipitation of insoluble noble<br><br>
metal compounds on the support by addition of alkaline<br>
compounds and final reduction to the noble metals.<br>
US-A-4,048, 096 describes a process for producing a<br>
palladium-, gold- and potassium-containing catalyst for<br>
vinyl acetate production. The catalyst support is first<br>
impregnated with a solution comprising a mixture of the<br>
dissolved palladium and gold salts. It is essential to<br>
that invention that the solution has the same volume as<br>
the pores of the support material in the dry state.<br>
During the impregnation step, the support particles are<br>
kept in motion in a rotating vessel. Without prior<br>
drying of the impregnated support, the noble metal<br>
salts on the support particles are subsequently<br>
converted into insoluble compounds by addition of<br>
alkalis and are thus fixed to the support particles.<br>
The palladium and gold compounds are reduced to the<br>
corresponding metals by a final treatment with a<br>
reducing agent. Application of an alkali metal compound<br>
in a further impregnation step gives a catalyst which<br>
has the desired shell structure and comprises palladium<br>
and gold in a thickness of 0.5 mm on the surface of the<br>
support material.<br>
US-A-3,775,342 also describes the production of a<br>
palladium-, gold- and potassium-containing catalyst for<br>
vinyl acetate production. In this process, the support<br>
material is treated in any order with two solutions of<br>
which one comprises the dissolved palladium and gold<br>
salts and the other an alkaline substance. After<br>
treatment with the first solution, the support is dried<br>
in an intermediate step before being brought into<br>
contact with the second solution. The volume of both<br>
solutions corresponds to the pore volume of the support<br>
material.<br>
Furthermore, US-A-5, 332, 710 discloses the production of<br>
a catalyst for preparing vinyl acetate, in which the<br>
insoluble noble metal salts are likewise precipitated<br><br>
on the support particles by addition of alkalis. For<br>
this purpose, the support particles are immersed in the<br>
alkaline solution and rare subjected to rotary motion<br>
from the commencement of the precipitation for at least<br>
half an hour in a drum. This process is known as<br>
"rotation-immersion".<br>
In the preparation of vinyl acetate, the catalysts<br>
produced as described in the abovementioned process<br>
frequently lead to undesirably high formation of<br>
degradation products and by-products, e.g. carbon<br>
dioxide, thus adversely affecting activity and<br>
selectivity of the overall reaction.<br>
In view of the fact that vinyl acetate is a volume<br>
product produced on a large industrial scale, it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a catalyst<br>
which has a further improved activity and selectivity<br>
in the preparation of vinyl acetate in the gas phase.<br>
The invention provides a process for producing a<br>
catalyst for the preparation of vinyl acetate in the<br>
gas phase from ethylene, acetic acid and oxygen or<br>
oxygen-containing gases, which catalyst comprises<br>
palladium and/or its compounds, gold and/or its<br>
compounds and also alkali metal compounds on a<br>
particulate, porous support and is produced by<br>
a)	impregnating the support with soluble<br>
palladium and gold compounds,<br>
b)	converting the soluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds into insoluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds by addition of an alkaline solution<br>
to the support,<br>
c)	reducing the insoluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds on the support by means of a<br>
reducing agent in the liquid or gaseous<br>
phase,<br>
d)	impregnating the support with at least one<br>
soluble alkali metal compound and<br><br>
e) finally drying the support at a maximum of<br>
150Â°C.<br>
In this process, the catalyst is brought into contact<br>
with at least one peroxidic compound in step b) .<br>
The invention also provides a catalyst for preparing<br>
vinyl acetate in the gas phase from ethylene, acetic<br>
acid and oxygen or oxygen-containing gases, which<br>
comprises palladium and/or its compounds, gold and/or<br>
its compounds and also alkali metal compounds on a<br>
particulate, porous support and is obtainable by the<br>
above-described process.<br>
The invention further provides a process for preparing<br>
vinyl acetate in the gas phase from ethylene, acetic<br>
acid and oxygen and/or oxygen-containing gases in the<br>
presence of a catalyst obtainable by the above-<br>
described process.<br>
In the preparation of vinyl acetate, the catalysts of<br>
the invention surprisingly lead both to an improved<br>
activity and to a higher selectivity of the reaction.<br>
The support particles of the catalyst of the invention<br>
can have any geometric shape, for example spheres,<br>
pellets, cylinders, rings or stars with a regular or<br>
irregular configuration. The dimensions of the support<br>
particles, i.e. the diameter or the lenqth and<br>
thickness are generally from 1 to 10 mm, in particular<br>
from 3 to 9 mm. Preference is given to using spherical<br>
support particles having a diameter of from 4 to 8 mm.<br>
Supports which can be used are the known inert support<br>
materials such as silica, aluminum oxide, alumino-<br>
silicates, silicates, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide,<br>
titanates, silicon carbide and carbon. Other suitable<br>
support materials are the!; pyrogenic silicas obtained by<br>
flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride or the<br>
pyrogenic SiO2-MxOy mixtures obtained by flame<br><br>
hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride and another metal<br>
chloride such as aluminum chloride (US-A-3,939,199 and<br>
EP-A-0 723 810). Preference is given to using silica<br>
(SiO2), baddeleyite (ZrO2) and SiO2-Al2O3 mixtures as<br>
support material. In the case of the pyrogenic support<br>
materials, the pressed bodies described in DE-A-38 03<br>
lr<br>
895 and DE-A-39 12 504 are particularly suitable.<br>
To be suitable as support material, it is critical that<br>
the material retains its mechanical strength under the<br>
reaction conditions of the catalytic process for<br>
preparing vinyl acetate, in particular in the presence<br>
of acetic acid.<br>
Particularly suitable supports are those of the above-<br>
mentioned type having a specific surface area of from<br>
50 to 400 m2/g (measured by the BET method) and a mean<br>
pore radius of from 50 to 2000 A (measured by means of<br>
mercury porosimetry).<br>
In step a) of the process of the invention, the<br>
impregnation step, the support particles are<br>
impregnated with the soluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds. Suitable palladium and gold compounds are<br>
all salts and complexes which are soluble in the<br>
solvents described below, can be precipitated as<br>
hydroxide or oxide and in the finished catalyst,<br>
possibly after a washing step, leave no materials which<br>
impair the performance of the catalyst.<br>
Examples of suitable palladium compounds are<br>
palladium(II) chloride, sodium and potassium<br>
chloropalladate(II) , palladium(II) nitrate, nitrite,<br>
sulfate, oxalate, acetyltacetonate or acetoacetate and<br>
hydrated palladium(II) oxide. It is also possible to<br>
use palladium salts of aliphatic monocarboxylic acids<br>
having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably<br>
palladium(II) acetate. Gold(III) chloride, gold(III)<br><br>
acetate, tetrachloroauric (III) acid and its alkali<br><br>
metal salts can be used as soluble gold compounds. In<br>
general, these compounds are used in such amounts that<br>
the finished catalyst comprises from 2 to 14 g/l,<br>
preferably from 4 to 8 g/l, of palladium and from 1 to<br>
8 g/1, preferably from 2 to 5 g/1, of gold.<br>
Suitable solvents for the] palladium and gold compounds<br>
and also for the alkali metal compounds to be applied<br>
in step d) are all compounds in which the salts chosen<br>
are soluble and which are easy to remove again in an<br>
optional drying step after the impregnation.<br>
Particularly suitable solvents are water and<br>
unsubstituted carboxylic acids having from 2 to 10<br>
carbon atoms, e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid, n- and<br>
iso-butyric acid and n- and iso-valeric acids. Owing to<br><br>
its favorable physical properties and also for economic<br>
reasons, the preferred carboxylic acid is acetic acid.<br>
It is advantageous to use an additional solvent when<br>
the palladium and gold compounds are not sufficiently<br>
soluble in the carboxylic acid used. Thus, for example,<br>
palladium(II) chloride dissolves significantly better<br>
in aqueous acetic acid than in glacial acetic acid.<br>
Suitable additional solvents are those which are inert<br>
and at the same time are miscible with the carboxylic<br>
acid, e.g. water, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or<br>
dioxane and hydrocarbons such as benzene.<br>
In the impregnation of the support material, it is<br>
possible to use a plurality of salts of each of the<br>
metals to be applied, but preference is given to using<br>
only one salt per metal.<br>
The impregnation of the support material with the<br>
soluble palladium and gold compounds in step a) can be<br>
carried out using a solution which simultaneously<br>
comprises all soluble palladium and gold compounds.<br>
Here, the support material can be impregnated once or a<br>
plurality of times with this solution. Since the amount<br>
of palladium and gold compounds used should be<br><br>
identical in single and multiple impregnation, the<br>
total volume of the solution should be divided<br>
appropriately in the case of multiple impregnation.<br>
Preference is given to a single impregnation with the<br>
total volume of the solution.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the impregnation of the<br>
support material can also be carried out using two<br>
separate solutions of which one contains the palladium<br>
compounds and the other contains the gold compounds. In<br>
this case, the two solutions can be brought into<br>
contact with the support material either simultaneously<br>
or else in any order. In the latter case, the support<br>
has to be dried after impregnation with the first<br>
solution.<br>
For effective impregnation, the total volume of the<br>
noble metal salt solution or of the two noble metal<br>
salt solutions should be about 90-100%, preferably 95-<br>
100% and in particular 98-99%, of the pore volume of<br>
the support material in the dry state. In practice, it<br>
is also possible to cover the support particles with an<br>
excess of the noble metal salt solution and<br>
subsequently to pour away or filter off the excess<br>
solution. However, preference is given to adding only<br>
the above-described amount of solution corresponding<br>
approximately to the pore volume of the catalyst<br>
support.<br>
It has been found to be advantageous to keep the<br>
support particles in motion during the impregnation to<br>
achieve intimate mixing. This can be done by means of a<br>
rotating or shaken flask or a mixing drum. The<br>
rotational speed or in general terms the intensity of<br>
the motion should be sufficient to achieve complete<br>
wetting of the support particles with the impregnation<br>
solution but must not be so great that appreciable<br>
abrasion of the support material occurs.<br><br>
The catalyst can subsequently be dried at temperatures<br>
of at most 150Â°C, preferably 80-150Â°C and in particular<br>
100-150Â°C. This drying procedure can be carried out,<br>
for example, in a stream of hot air in a fan-forced<br>
drier or else in a drying oven in a stream of inert<br>
gas, in particular a stream of nitrogen or carbon<br>
dioxide. Drying is carried out at atmospheric pressure<br>
or under reduced pressure, preferably 0.01-0.08 MPa.<br>
In step b) , the fixing step, the soluble palladium and<br>
gold compounds present on the support particles are<br>
converted into insoluble compounds by means of an<br>
alkaline solution, and are thus fixed to the support. It<br>
is assumed that the insoluble compounds are the<br>
hydroxides and/or oxides of the noble metals.<br>
Suitable alkaline solutions are all solutions which are<br>
able to convert the soluble palladium and gold<br>
compounds into insoluble compounds. Examples of<br>
alkaline reagents which can be used are alkali metal<br>
hydroxides, alkali metal silicates and alkali metal<br>
carbonates. Preference is given to an aqueous solution<br>
of the alkali metal hydroxides, in particular of<br>
potassium or sodium hydroxide. Solutions containing<br>
boron compounds can also be used as alkaline solutions.<br>
Here, aqueous solutions of sodium tetraborate<br>
decahydrate (borax), potassium tetraborate or mixtures<br>
of alkali metal if hydroxide and boric acid are<br>
i<br>
particularly suitable. The, alkaline solution can have<br>
buffer properties.<br>
The amount of alkaline compound present in the aqueous<br>
solution is advantageously selected so that it is at<br>
least sufficient for the stoichiometric reaction with<br>
the soluble palladium and gold compounds applied<br>
However, it is also possible to use an excess of the<br>
alkaline compound, usually 1-10 times the<br>
stoichiometrically required amount.<br><br>
It is essential to the process of the invention that<br>
the catalyst is brought into contact with at least one<br>
peroxidic compound in step b).<br>
This peroxidic compound can be, for example, a<br>
perborate, preferably sodium perborate, a percarbonate,<br>
preferably sodium percarbonate, a peroxodisulfate,<br>
preferably sodium peroxodisulfate, or hydrogen<br>
peroxide.<br>
One possible embodiment comprises adding the peroxidic<br>
compound to the alkaline solution which already<br>
comprises one of the abovementioned alkaline<br>
substances, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, a second, separate solution<br>
comprising the peroxidic compound can be used in<br>
step b) is addition to the alkaline solution. In this<br>
case, the impregnated catalyst support, as described<br>
below, is first brought into contact with the alkaline<br>
solution and subsequently treated with the aqueous<br>
solution of the peroxidic compound before the reduction<br>
is carried out in step c) . Since some of the peroxidic<br>
compounds mentioned are themselves alkaline, e.g. the<br>
perborates and percarbonates, it is also possible, in a<br>
third and preferred embodiment, for the alkaline<br>
solution to be used in step b) to comprise only the<br>
peroxidic compound which is simultaneously alkaline.<br>
It has been found to be useful to heat the solution<br>
which comprises the peroxidic compounds to a maximum of<br>
90Â°C, preferably to 60-85Â°C, before addition to the<br>
impregnated catalyst support.<br>
In all three embodiments, the peroxidic compound is<br>
used in a 1-20-fold, preferably 5-10-fold, excess based<br>
on the concentration of the noble metal salt. It is<br>
found that contact of the impregnated catalyst support<br>
with at least one peroxidic compound in the fixing step<br>
b) leads to some reduction of the noble metals.<br><br>
Two methods I and II which are suitable for carrying<br>
out the fixing step b) and can be employed in the<br>
production of the catalyst of the invention are<br>
described below.<br>
In method I, the support material impregnated in step<br>
a) is placed for a sufficient time in an alkaline<br>
solution whose concentration is such that the desired,<br>
insoluble noble metal compounds are precipitated. In<br>
addition, the volume of the alkaline solution is<br>
selected so that it is sufficient to completely cover<br>
and immerse the impregnated support particles.<br>
Furthermore, the impregnated support particles immersed<br>
in the alkaline solution are subjected to rotary motion<br>
commencing with the precipitation of the insoluble<br>
palladium and gold compounds for at least half an hour,<br>
preferably one hour and at most up to 4 hours. This<br>
fixing method is known as "rotation-immersion" and is<br>
described in detail in US-A-5,332,710, which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
In this variant I, the additional treatment of the<br>
catalyst support with the peroxidic compound can be<br>
carried out as described in the three abovementioned<br>
embodiments.<br>
If the method II described below is employed for fixing<br>
the palladium and gold compounds to the support<br>
particles, the support which has been impregnated in<br>
step a) should be dried before the fixing step b).<br>
In method II, the fixing step b) comprises at least two<br>
separate stages of treatment with the alkaline fixing<br>
solution. In the. first fixing stage, the impregnated<br>
and then dried support is brought into contact with the<br>
alkaline fixing solution. The volume of this first<br>
fixing solution corresponds to the pore volume and thus<br>
the absorptive capacity of the support material in the<br>
dry state. The amount of alkaline compounds present<br><br>
therein should be such that the molar ratio of alkali<br>
metal from the alkaline compound to anions from the<br>
soluble metal salt is in the range from 0.7:1 to 2:1.<br>
For absorption on the support particles, the alkaline<br>
fixing solution is poured onto the support particles<br>
and they are then left to stand for up to 24 hours,<br>
preferably 2-8 hours.<br>
In this method II, the second fixing stage can be<br>
carried out in two variants A) and B). In both<br>
variants, the molar ratio of the alkali metal from the<br>
alkaline compound to the anion from the metal salt is<br>
from about 0.2:1 to 2:1 in the fixing solution.<br>
In variant A) of method II, the undried support<br>
particles are brought into contact with the second<br>
fixing solution whose volume should at least just cover<br>
the supports. For absorption on the support particles,<br>
the alkaline fixing solution is poured onto the support<br>
particles and they are then left to stand for up to 16<br>
hours, but at least 2 hours and preferably at least 4<br>
hours.<br>
In variant B), the support material after contact with<br>
the first fixing solution is, in the second step,<br>
treated by the rotation-immersion process of<br>
US-A-5,332,710. Here, the support material is immersed<br>
in the alkaline fixing solution of the second step and<br>
at the same time subjected to rotary motion. This<br>
rotation should continue for at least half an hour,<br>
preferably one hour and at most up to 4 hours.<br>
Regardless of whether variant A) or B) is employed, the<br>
treatment in the second fixing step can be equivalent<br>
to the treatment in the first stage in that a fixing<br>
solution of the same concentration is used and the<br>
volume of the second fixing solution likewise<br>
corresponds to the pore volume and thus the absorptive<br>
capacity of the support material in the dry state. The<br>
total molar ration of alkali metal to anion from the<br><br>
liquid phase at a temperature of 0-90Â°C, preferably 15-<br>
25Â°C. The reducing agent used here is, for example,<br>
hydrazine, formic acid or an alkali metal borohydride,<br>
preferably sodium borohydride- As an alternative, it is<br>
also possible to carry out the reduction in the gas<br>
phase using hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, isobutylene,<br>
butylene or other olefins as reducing agent. In this<br>
case, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction at<br>
an increased temperature of 40-260Â°C, preferably<br>
70-200Â°C. It is also advantageous to dilute the<br>
reducing agent with an inert gas. The inert gas used<br>
can be, for example, nitrogen, carbon dioxide or a<br>
noble gas. Such a reducing agent/inert gas mixture<br>
usually contains 0.01-50% by volume, preferably 0.5-20%<br>
by volume, of reducing agent.<br>
Regardless of whether the reduction is carried out in<br>
the liquid or gas phase, the reducing agent should be<br>
added in an excess, based on the catalyst to be<br>
reduced, so as to ensure that all the insoluble noble<br>
metal compound is converted into the metallic form.<br>
After the reduction, the support particles can be<br>
washed again once or a plurality of times, preferably<br>
with distilled water, to remove interfering anions,<br>
e.g. chlorides, and residues of the alkaline solution<br>
used. The washing procedure can also serve to remove<br>
residues of the reducing agent from step c).<br>
Subsequently, the catalyst is dried again under drying<br>
conditions which should be similar to those of a drying<br>
step after the fixing step b).<br>
Finally, the addition of at least one alkali metal<br>
compound is necessary. The catalyst is therefore<br>
impregnated with an aqueous solution of an alkali metal<br>
compound in step d). Alkali metal compounds which can<br>
be used are sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium,<br>
compounds; preference is given to potassium compounds.<br><br>
Suitable anions of these alkali metal compounds are, in<br>
particular, carboxylates, especially acetates or<br>
propionates. Particular preference is given to using<br>
potassium acetate. However, it is also possible to use<br>
compounds which liberate alkali metal acetates under<br>
the reaction conditions, i.e. the alkal metal<br>
hydroxides, oxides or carbonates when acetic acid is<br>
used as solvent. This impregnation is carried out, in<br>
principle, in the same way as the impregnation of the<br>
support material in step a) . The solvents which can be<br>
used are subject to the same conditions and definitions<br>
as in the case of the solutions in impregnation step<br>
a). The alkali metal compound is used in such an amount<br>
that the catalyst after the drying step described below<br>
contains 0.1-10% by weight of alkali metal, preferably<br>
1-4% by weight of alkali metal, in particular<br>
potassium, based on the total mass of the catalyst.<br>
Finally, the catalyst is, in step e) , dried at<br>
temperatures of at most 150Â°C, preferably 80-150Â°C and<br>
in particular 100-150Â°C. This drying procedure can be<br>
carried out, for example, in a stream of hot air in a<br>
fan-forced drier or else in a drying oven in a stream<br>
of inert gas, in particular in a stream of nitrogen or<br>
carbon dioxide. Drying is carried out at atmospheric<br>
pressure or under reduced pressure, preferably<br>
0.01-0.08 MPa.<br>
The catalyst obtainable by steps a) to e) of the<br>
process of the invention and the treatment with the<br>
peroxidic compounds essential to the invention in<br>
step b) comprises, based on the total mass of the<br>
catalyst, 0.2-2.5% by weight, preferably 0.6-1.5% by<br>
weight, of palladium, 0.2-2.5% by weight, preferably<br>
0.3-1.0% by weight, of gold and 0.1-10% by weight of<br>
alkali metal, preferably 1.0-4.0% by weight of alkali<br>
metal, in particular potassium.<br><br>
Vinyl acetate is prepared by passing acetic acid,<br>
ethylene and oxygen or oxygen-containing gases at<br>
temperatures of from 100 to 220Â°C, preferably from 120<br>
to 200Â°C, and pressures of from 0.1 to 2.5 MPa,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 2 MPa, over the catalyst of the<br>
invention. Unreacted component, can be circulated. In<br>
some cases, dilution with inert gases such as nitrogen<br>
or carbon dioxide is also advantageous. Carbon dioxide<br>
is particularly suitable for dilution in a circulation<br>
mode of operation since it is in any case formed during<br>
the reaction.<br>
It has been found to be useful to carry out the<br>
preparation of the vinyl acetate in a stirred reactor,<br>
a Berty reactor, in circulation mode in the gas phase<br>
at a constant oxygen conversion of about 45%. The<br>
reactor is first charged with the catalyst.<br>
Subsequently, a measured amount of acetic acid and also<br>
ethylene and oxygen diluted with nitrogen is introduced<br>
and the temperature is increased to the desired value<br>
by means of a heating mantle. The reaction is usually<br>
stopped after about 18 hours, as long it has been<br>
possible to set a temperature at which the oxygen<br>
conversion is constant at 45%. The composition of the<br>
product mixture is determined by means of gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
The higher selectivity and activity achievable using<br>
the catalysts of the invention can in practice be<br>
utilized in two ways:<br>
Firstly, to produce a larger amount of vinyl acetate<br>
per unit volume and unit time in existing plants while<br>
retaining all other reaction conditions. Owing to the<br>
higher selectivity, the product mixture taken from the<br>
reactor has a higher proportion of vinyl acetate and<br>
contains less by-products, in particular carbon<br>
dioxide. In this way, the work-up, i.e. the isolation<br>
of the vinyl acetate, is made easier because, for<br>
example, the amount of carbon dioxide to be separated<br><br>
off is lower and accordingly the loss of entrained<br>
ethylene associated with the removal of carbon dioxide<br>
drops. This leads to a saving in starting material. The<br>
principles of the work-up of the product mixture after<br>
the preparation of vinyl acetate are described, for<br>
example, in EP-A-0 423 658.<br>
The second possible way of utilizing the improved<br>
properties of the catalysts of the invention is to<br>
lower the reaction temperature in the preparation of<br>
vinyl acetate while maintaining the same space-time<br>
yield. A lower reaction temperature in turn has a<br>
positive effect on the total operational life of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
Examples:<br>
The catalysts in Examples 1-5 are produced using silica<br>
based on bentonite as support material. This is the<br>
KA-160 support from Sud-Chemie; spheres having a<br>
diameter of 7 mm are employed in Examples 1-4 and 6-8<br>
and spheres having a diameter of 5 mm are employed in<br>
Example 5.<br>
Example 1<br>
5.37 g (0.0164 mol) of K2PdCl4 and 3.36 g (0.0089 mol)<br>
of KAuCl4 are together dissolved in 80 ml of<br>
demineralized water. All of this solution is, with<br>
gentle motion, applied to 131 g of the support<br>
material. The support which has been pretreated in this<br>
way is placed in a solution of 18.31 g (0.12 mol) of<br>
sodium perborate tetrahydrate (NaBO3 â¢ 4H2O) in 300 ml<br>
of distilled water and the total reaction mixture is<br>
rotated on a rotary evaporator at a speed of 5<br>
revolutions per minute for 3.5 hours at 85Â°C to<br>
complete the reaction. The reaction mixture is allowed<br>
to stand for about 12 hours and then washed free of<br>
chloride with demineralized water. The freedom from<br><br>
chloride is checked by means of the silver nitrate test<br>
for chloride ions in aqueous solution. The material is<br>
then dried for 2 hours, at 100Â°C. It can be shown by<br>
photoelectron spectroscopy that after this step the<br>
noble metal shell formed comprises metallic gold and<br>
palladium in the oxidation state +2. Subsequently, the<br>
noble metals are reduced completely using diluted<br>
ethylene (5% in nitrogen). For this purpose, the gas<br>
mixture is passed over the catalyst for 5 hours at<br>
150Â°C. 10 g of potassium acetate are then dissolved in<br>
75 ml of distilled water and added a little at a time<br>
to the catalyst and the latter is dried once more for<br>
2 hours at 100Â°C.<br>

To examine the performance of the catalysts described<br>
in the preparation of vinyl acetate, tests are carried<br>
out in a Berty reactor. The results are summarized in<br>
the table:<br><br>

temperature in the middle of the wall of the Berty<br>
reactor used for testing, is recorded at a constant<br>
oxygen conversion of about 45%. Low wall temperatures<br>
at a constant oxygen conversion mean a relatively high<br>
catalyst activity.<br><br>
