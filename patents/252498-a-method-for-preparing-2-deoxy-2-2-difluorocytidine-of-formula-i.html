				<td>METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2'-DEOXY-2',2'-DIFLUOROCYTIDINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for stereoselectively preparing<br>
2' -deoxy-2' ,2' -difluorocytidine.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
2'-Deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine (Gemcitabine) of formula (I) has a cytosine nucleobase<br>
stereochemically-oriented to p-direction at the 1-position of the ribofuranose backbone, and is effective for<br>
treating various cancers such as non-small cell lung (NSCLC), pancreatic, bladder, breast or ovarian cancers.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Gemcitabine can be conventionally prepared from a lactol compound as shown in Reaction Scheme 1<br>
via an activated ribofuranose intermediate having a reactive leaving group.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br>
Act ivat ion of<br>
OH 1-hydroxy<br>
P1C<br>
1, Nucleobase<br>
2. Deprotect ion<br>
A c t i v a t e d r i b o f u r a n o s e OH F<br>
wherein, P1 is a hydroxyl protecting group and L is a leaving group.<br>
Examples of the activated ribofuranose intermediate for glycosylation are 1-sulfonate ribofuranose such<br>
as a-methanesulfonate ribofuranose and 1-halo ribufuranose.<br>
The a-methanesulfonate ribofuranose may be reacted with a nucleobase to carry out stereoselective<br>
glycosylation to obtain the desired (i-nucleosides in a high yield (See US Patent Nos. 5,371,210, 5,401,838,<br>
5,426,183, 5,594,124 and 5,606,048 and EP Patent No. 577303). However, so as to produce<br>
u-methanesulfonate ribofuranose in a high ratio as compared with P- methanesulfonate ribofuranose, it is<br>
required to a cryogenic condition of below about -80 , and thus, this method is not suitable for the mass<br>
production.<br>
The 1-halo ribufuranose derivatives may be easily produced under a mild condition (e.g., room<br>
temperature) and reacted with an anionic nucleobase to carry out glycosylation (See US Patent No. 5,744,597<br>
and EP Patent No. 577304). However, the glycosylation using a 1-halo ribofuranose derivative is<br>
non-stereoselective (i.e., anomerization at 1-position is occurred), leading to a mixture of a- and<br>
p-nucleosides and ultimately to a low yield of the desired p-nucleoside.<br>
US Patent No. 5,223,608 discloses a process for selectively isolating the p-anomer of<br>
cytidinenucleoside from a 1:1 mixture of a- and P- cytidinenucleoside anomers by converting the mixture<br>
into the hydrochloride form, dissolving the hydrochloride mixture in hot water, adjusting pH of the resulting<br>
solution to 8.2, and cooling and filtering the solution. However, this process also give a low yield of the<br>
P-anomer.<br>
The present inventors have endeavored to overcome the problems of the prior arts and found that an<br>
anomerization is effectively suppressed by removing the halide compound as it is generated during the<br>
glycosylation when 1-halo ribofuranose derivative is used and consequently the stereoselectivity can be<br>
markedly enhanced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved method for preparing<br>
2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine in a high purity and yield under a new stereoselective glycosylation reaction<br>
using a 1-halo ribofuranose.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing<br>
2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine of formula (I), which comprises the steps of<br>
(i) reacting a 1 -halo ribofuranose compound of formula (III) with a nucleobase of formula (IV) in a<br>
solvent to obtain a nucleoside of formula (II) while continuously removing the silyl halide of<br>
formula (V) produced during the reaction; and<br>
(ii) deprotecting the nucleoside of formula (II) to obtain 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>
R is alkyl;<br>
P1 is a hydroxy-protecting group;<br>
P2 is an amino-protecting group; and<br>
X is halogen.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
following description of the invention taken in conjunction with the following accompanying drawings, which<br>
show:<br>
FIGs. 1 to 3: high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) scans of the compounds prepared in<br>
Example 4, Comparative Examples 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventive method is characterized that the compound of formula (I) can be efficiently prepared<br>
by continuously removing the silyl halide of formula (V) which is produced during the glycosylation.<br>
The term "anomer-enriched" used herein means an anomer mixture having a specific anomer content of<br>
greater than 50%, including a substantially pure anomer. Also, the term "anomerization" means that a<br>
substantially pure anomer or a mixture of a-anomer and (3-anomer is epimerized at the Ci-position of a<br>
ribofuranose.<br>
The term "carrier" used herein means a solvent that is used to remove the silyl halide produced during<br>
the glycosylation and the term "heating medium" means a solvent of a high boiling point that can provide a<br>
sufficient heat to a reaction system and maintain the reaction mixture at a sufficiently high temperature to enable<br>
the continuous removal of the silyl halide by distillation.<br>
The term "substituted" used herein means substitution alone or in combination by at least one or more of<br>
the groups selected from hydrogen, cyano, halo, carboalkoxy, toluoyl, nitro, alkoxy and alkyl.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the stereoselective glycosylation is carried out as shown in<br>
Reaction Scheme 2.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Specifically, an a-anomer enriched 1-halo ribofuranose of formula (III) is reacted with a nucleobase of<br>
formula (IV) for glycosylation to produce a p-nucleoside of formula (II) together with a silyl halide of formula<br>
(V) which may function as a halide source to bring about the anomerization of a-anomer. Accordingly, the<br>
silyl halide is continuously removed as it is formed by simple distillation or by using an inert gas until the<br>
glycosylation reaction is completed. As a result, the extent of anomerization is remarkably reduced and highly<br>
stereoselective glycosylation occurs in favor of the p-anomer.<br>
The distillation is carried out with simultaneously adding a carrier or a mixture of a carrier and a heating<br>
medium which have a high boiling point dropwise to the reaction mixture for glycosylation.<br>
Alternatively, the inert gas is passed through a separate tube which is inserted in a reactor to exhaust the<br>
silyl halide out of the reaction mixture without affecting the glycosylation reaction. The inert gas is introduced<br>
from the tube which is set up within (bubbling) or above (sweeping) the reacting solution for the removal of silyl<br>
halide.<br>
The a-anomer enriched 1 -halo ribofuranose of formula (III) used as a starting material in the inventive<br>
method has a hydroxy-protecting group, and can be prepared by the method described in Korean Patent<br>
Application No. 2004-59623. Exemplary hydroxy-protecting groups are formyl, acetyl, substituted acetyl,<br>
propionyl, butynyl, pivalamido, benzoyl, biphenylcarbonyl, substituted biphenylcarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl,<br>
t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, phenoxycarbonyl, benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, t-butyl,<br>
tetrahydropyranyl, allyl, N-phenylcarbamate, N-imidazoyl carbamate, trialkylsilyl, isopropyldialkylsilyl,<br>
alkyldiisopropylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl and t-butyldialkylsilyl. Among these, benzoyl, biphenylcarbonyl<br>
and substituted biphenylcarbonyl are more preferred.<br>
The nucleobase of formula (IV) has an amino-protecting group, and it can be prepared by use of the<br>
methods described in US Patent Nos. 5,371,210, 5,401,838, 5,426,183, 5,594,124 and 5,606,048 and EP<br>
Patent No. 577303. Exemplary amino-protecting groups are silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl,<br>
triisopropylsilyl, tributylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl and t-butyldiarylsilyl; carbamates such as<br>
t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl; formyl,<br>
acetyl, benzoyl and pivaloyl, methoxymethyl, t-butyl, benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Among these,<br>
trimethylsilyl is most preferred.<br>
In the inventive method, the nucleobase of formula (IV) is used in an amount ranging from 5 to 50<br>
molar equivalents, preferably 10 to 30 molar equivalents, more preferably 15 to 20 molar equivalents, based<br>
on the 1-halo ribofuranose of formula (III).<br>
The solvents suitable for use in the present glycosylation process are benzene, substituted benzene,<br>
toluene, xylene, decalin, diglyme, 2-ethoxyethyl ether, diphenylether, substituted diphenylether, biphenyl,<br>
substituted biphenyl, C6.|4 alkane, substituted C6.]4 alkane and a mixture thereof. Amone these, toluene,<br>
C714 alkane, diphenylether and a mixture thereof are preferred, and a mixture of diphenylether and heptane is<br>
most preferred. The solvent is used in an amount ranging from 5 to 50 , preferably 10 to 20 based on<br>
1 g of 1-halo ribofuranose of formula (III).<br>
The carrier used to assist the removal of the silyl halide of formula (V) by distillation must be inert under<br>
the glycosylation reaction conditions and preferably has a boiling point higher than that of the silyl halide.<br>
The carrier may be benzene, substituted benzene, toluene, xylene, C6_i4 alkane, substituted Ce-u alkane and a<br>
mixture thereof. Among these, toluene, heptane, octane and nonane are preferred, and heptane is most<br>
preferred. The carrier is used in an amount ranging from 50 to 1000 , preferably 100 to 300 based on<br>
1 g of the 1-halo ribofuranose of formula (III).<br>
In the inventive method, a heating medium having a high boiling point of 200 or higher may be<br>
further used in the form of a mixture with the carrier, so as to provide a reaction system with sufficient heat and<br>
complement the loss solvent due to distillation. The heating medium must be inert under the glycosylation<br>
reaction conditions and preferably"has a boiling point higher than that of the carrier. The heating medium<br>
may be selected from the group consisting of decalin, diphenylether, substituted diphenylether, biphenyl,<br>
substituted biphenyl and a mixture thereof. Among these, diphenylether is most preferred. The heating<br>
medium is used in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 5 vol%, preferably 0.5 to 3 vol% based on the amount of<br>
the carrier.<br>
It is preferred that the carrier and the heating medium are continuously added to the reaction mixture<br>
in a constant rate until the glycosylation reaction is completed, so as to obtain a uniform stereoselectivity.<br>
In addition, a silyl source such as N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) may be further added in<br>
the form of a mixture with the carrier to the reaction mixture, so as to enhance the removal of the silyl halide<br>
by distillation. The silyl source may be used in an amount ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 vol%, preferably 0.1 to<br>
0.5 vol% based on the amount of the carrier.<br>
In the present invention, an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, neon and argon, preferably nitrogen,<br>
may also be used in the removal of the silyl halide of formula (V). The inert gas is preferably introduced at a<br>
flow rate of 1 /min or more based on lOOg of 1-halo ribofuranose compound of formula (III). When the inert<br>
gas is introduced at a flow rate less than 1 /min, the ratio of p-nucleosides to a-nucleosides becomes not more<br>
than 3.<br>
The glycosylation according to the present invention is carried out at a temperature ranging from 80<br>
to 300 , preferably 100 to 200 , more preferably 130 to 150 for 4 to 24 hours.<br>
The progress of the glycosylation may be checked by thin layer chromatography (TLC), 'H nucleus<br>
magnetic resonance ('H -NMR) or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The deprotection of the p-anomer enriched nucleoside of formula (II) may be carried out by a<br>
conventional method. For example, most silyl protecting groups are easily cleaved by the action of water or<br>
an alcohol. The acyl-amino protecting groups such as formyl, acetyl, pivaloyl and benzoyl are removed by<br>
hydrolysis with a strong base. Such bases include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium or potassium<br>
hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or potassium t-butoxide; diethylamine,<br>
hydroxylamine, ammonia, hydrazine and the like, among these, ammonia is preferred. Also, the acyl<br>
protecting groups can be removed using an acid catalyst such as methanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid,<br>
hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, or an acidic ion exchange resin.<br>
p-Anomer enriched nucleoside of formula (II) may be obtained in a pure form by a separation based on<br>
solubility difference from a mixture of p-anomer enriched nucleoside of formula (II) and the unreacted cytosine<br>
as produced after the deprotection. The separation is preferably carried out by using the solvent system<br>
consisting of methylene chloride and methanol wherein p-anomer enriched nucleoside of formula (II) is highly<br>
soluble while the unreacted cytosine is sparingly soluble.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the stereoselective glycosylation of the present invention, a p-enriched<br>
nucleoside product having an a:p ratio of 1:4 to 1:14 is obtained.<br>
The p-nucleoside of formula (I) can be isolated in the form of hemihydrate or dihydrate in a high<br>
purity of 99.8% or more and a yield of 70% or more by a single recrystallization procedure which comprises<br>
dissolving the o/p anomer mixture in water, heating the mixture to a temperature of 40 to 60 , cooling to 10<br>
to 25 and filtering the solids precipitated during the cooling step. This procedure may be conducted with<br>
stirring when the hemihydrate form is derived or without stirring for the dihydrate form.<br>
It has been proved that the hemihydrate or dihydrate form of the P-nucleoside obtained by the present<br>
invention is stable for the moisture content changes thereof under the conditions shown in Table 1.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Theoretical moisture content of Gemsitabine: Hemihydrate 3.3% dihydrate<br>
12.0%<br>
The highly pure hemihydrate or dihydrate of p-nucleosides can be directly used without further<br>
purification to prepare a pharmaceutically acceptable hydrochloride salt of the purity range described in pp<br>
892-894 of U.S. Pharmacopoeia (2004).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for preparing<br>
2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine hydrochloride comprising reacting 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine of formula<br>
(1) or a hemihydrate or dihydrate thereof with hydrochloric acid in an organic solvent.<br>
The present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples. However, it<br>
should be understood that the present is not restricted by the specific Examples.<br>
