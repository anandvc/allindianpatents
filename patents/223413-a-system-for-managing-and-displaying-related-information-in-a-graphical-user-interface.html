TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the field of<br>
analytical data processing, and more particularly to a<br>
method and system for displaying a plurality of discrete<br>
files in a compound file.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Business intelligence systems began largely as<br>
decision support systems (DSS) and executive information<br>
systems (EIS). Decision support systems (DSS) and<br>
executive information systems (EIS) were value added<br>
systems that provided additional information from existing<br>
on-line transactional processing (OLTP) systems.<br>
As business intelligence systems developed, they<br>
integrated decision support system (DSS) functionality with<br>
executive information system (EIS) functionality, and added<br>
on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools and management<br>
reporting tools. These hybrid business intelligence<br>
systems were gradually moved from a main-frame environment<br>
to a distributed server/desktop environment to allow<br>
greater user access.<br>
More recently, the advent of centralized data<br>
warehouses and datamarts have created a dramatic increase<br>
in available data waiting to be analyzed, exploited and<br>
distributed within an organization. Such data warehouses<br>
and datamarts, however, were typically optimized for<br>
information delivery rather than transactional processing.<br>
As a result, data warehouses and datamarts offered only<br>
limited solutions for turning stored data into useful and<br>
strategic tactical information. During this same time,<br>
business intelligence systems gained prominence by offering<br>
sophisticated analysis tools for analyzing large amounts of<br>
stored information to support effective planning and<br>
decision-making within an organization.<br>
Business intelligence systems display multidimensional<br>
and other data views in a graphical user interface.<br>
Typically, graphical user interfaces use a single data<br>
interface (SDI) to allow related data to be stored and<br>
viewed together. Single data interfaces, however, do not<br>
support contemporaneously viewing and manipulation of data<br>
in separate files. For this, graphical user interfaces<br>
employ a multiple data interface (MDI) format. During<br>
viewing of disparate files in a multiple data interface<br>
(MDI), however, windows are often maximized to provide<br>
optimal viewing. This leads to constant opening, closing,<br>
and resizing of windows by a user to view the disparate<br>
files, which limits the ability of the user to effectively<br>
compare and contrast data in the files. In addition, the<br>
multiple data interface (MDI) fails to allow related sets<br>
of data to be stored and associated with each other.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method and system for<br>
displaying a plurality of discrete files in a compound file<br>
that substantially eliminate or reduce disadvantages and<br>
problems associated with previous systems and methods. In<br>
particular, the method and system provides a graphical user<br>
interface that links and displays discrete but related<br>
files together and that allows for efficient navigation<br>
between such displays in order to facilitate data analysis.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a method for managing and displaying related<br>
information in a graphical user interface includes storing<br>
each of a plurality of related datasets in a discrete file.<br>
A compound file is stored linking the discrete data files<br>
to each other. A common window for the combined file is<br>
displayed in the graphical user interface. A discrete<br>
window for each discrete file is displayed within the<br>
common window.<br>
More specifically, in accordance with a particular<br>
embodiment of the present invention, each of the discrete<br>
files may be separately stored in the compound file. In<br>
another embodiment, the compound file may store a link to<br>
each of the discrete files. In these and other<br>
embodiments, the common window may be displayed in a single<br>
data interface (SDI) and the discrete windows may be<br>
displayed within the common window in a multiple data<br>
interface (MDI).<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present<br>
invention, a method for displaying discrete windows in a<br>
graphical user interface includes generating a view button<br>
for a first window in response to the first window becoming<br>
at least substantially hidden from display by overlay of a<br>
second window. The view button is displayed outside the<br>
second window along an edge of the second window or in<br>
other suitable locations. In response to activation of the<br>
view button, the first window is displayed by the graphical<br>
user interface.<br>
Technical advantages of the present invention include<br>
providing an improved business intelligence portal that<br>
allows users to easily access and analyze data. In<br>
particular, the business intelligence portal includes a<br>
graphical user interface that allows related documents to<br>
be easily organized together and efficiently displayed to a<br>
user. In addition, elements of the user interface are<br>
highly intuitive to minimize the need for training and<br>
support.<br>
Another technical advantage of the present invention<br>
includes providing a method and system for navigating<br>
between windows in a graphical user interface. In<br>
particular, view buttons are provided for hidden windows<br>
along an edge of an overlaying window or elsewhere to allow<br>
users to quickly and easily navigate between the windows.<br>
As a result, users need not constantly move, close, open,<br>
and resize windows to view related data stored in disparate<br>
files.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for managing and displaying<br>
related information in a graphical user interface, comprising:<br>
a server:<br>
storing each of a plurality of related datasets in a discrete file;<br>
storing a compound file linking the discrete files to each other; and<br>
a client:<br>
displaying in a graphical user interface a common window for the<br>
compound file; and<br>
displaying within the common window a discrete window for each discrete<br>
file.<br>
Other technical advantages of the present invention<br>
will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the<br>
following figures, description, and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a business intelligence portal 10<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Generally described, the business intelligence portal 10<br>
provides integrated data access and information sharing<br>
across an enterprise, as well as sophisticated<br>
multidimensional analysis tools. The analysis tools are<br>
highly automated and intuitive to allow a wide range of<br>
users to utilize stored information in making strategic<br>
decisions. In this way, the business intelligence portal<br>
10 maximizes decision support benefits users receive from<br>
their data, while minimizing the cost of implementing and<br>
administrating the system.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated by FIGURE 1, the<br>
business intelligence portal 10 implements a three-tier<br>
distributed architecture comprising a database tier 12, a<br>
server tier 14, and a client tier 16 connected by one or<br>
more networks 18. The server and client tiers 14 and 16<br>
are Java-based to support the Internet communication<br>
protocol (TCP/IP), multiple client and server platforms,<br>
pooled connections to a wide variety of data sources, and<br>
complete scalability of the portal 10 across an enterprise.<br>
In addition, the Java-based server and client tiers 14 and<br>
16 provide an open API architecture that is highly<br>
adaptable and functional for processing structured data in<br>
databases as well as unstructured data. The client/server<br>
network 18 comprises a company Intranet while the<br>
Server/database network 18 includes portions of public and<br>
private networks. It will be understood that the business<br>
intelligence portal 10 may be implemented using other<br>
suitable architectures, programming languages, and links.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1, the database tier 12 includes<br>
one or more databases 20. As described in more detail<br>
below, the databases 20 are each exposed as an alias that<br>
contains all the information necessary to connect to the<br>
database 20, including the database login. The use of<br>
database aliases prevents direct user access to the native<br>
database in order to maintain the integrity in the database<br>
20. For the illustrative embodiment, the databases 20 may<br>
each be any Java database connection (JDBC) or object<br>
database connection (ODBC) compliant database, as well as a<br>
suitable data warehouse or datamart.<br>
The server tier 14 includes one or more servers 30.<br>
The servers 3 0 each comprise a set of Java-based<br>
applications that can operate on different platforms. As<br>
described in more detail below, the servers 30 provide<br>
hierarchical security, centralized administration, fast<br>
multithreaded pooled data access, and multidimensional data<br>
analysis for the business intelligence portal 10.<br>
The server 30 includes a catalog 32, a catalog manager<br>
34, a security manager 36, a query generator 38, a database<br>
access system 40, a cache manager 42, a multidimensional<br>
model manager 44, and a client administrator 46. The<br>
catalog 32 stores all configurations, documents, and work<br>
products created by administrators and users of the<br>
business intelligence portal 10. This centralizes<br>
management of documents, eliminates redundant and outdated<br>
copies residing on client systems, allows documents to be<br>
shared across an enterprise, and provides continual<br>
security for the documents. The catalog manager 34 manages<br>
all shared information within the server 30. It will be<br>
understood that such configurations, documents, and work<br>
products may be otherwise suitably stored and managed<br>
within the business intelligence portal 10.<br>
The catalog 32 includes one or more database aliases<br>
50, user profiles 52, security groups 54, and predefined<br>
query models 56 configured by a system administrator. The<br>
catalog 32 also includes one or more portfolios 58 that<br>
store related views 60 created by a system user. As<br>
previously described, the database aliases 50 contain all<br>
information necessary to connect to the databases 20. The<br>
use of the database aliases 50 prevents direct user<br>
database access to maintain data integrity in the native<br>
databases 20 and makes it possible for non-technical users<br>
to safely access corporate data without fear of corruption.<br>
In addition, the database aliases 50 also serve to pool<br>
connections to the physical databases 20 and thereby reduce<br>
the number of database connections required to support a<br>
large number of clients.<br>
The user prOfiles 52 each define a specific range of<br>
privileges for a user and one or more security groups 54 to<br>
which a user has access. The user profiles 52 are<br>
generated and maintained by a system administrator. The<br>
security groups 54 implement a hierarchical security model<br>
with security rights and privileges assigned to each group<br>
54 by a system administrator. An administrator security<br>
group is provided to allow administrators full access to<br>
the system, including permissions to add, modify, and<br>
delete security groups 54 and user profiles 52 in the<br>
system. The final security rights and privileges that a<br>
user inherits are the union of his or her individual rights<br>
as defined in the user profiles 52 and the rights of each<br>
security group 54 to which he or she belongs. In this way,<br>
exposure of system features to users is controlled through<br>
the extensive use of permissions, or privileges, which are<br>
assigned or withheld from security groups 54 or individual<br>
user profiles 52. Thus, while administrators may have the<br>
ability to connect to databases 20 and add or delete users,<br>
power users might not have this permission. Instead, power<br>
users may have access to a full range of data analysis and<br>
collaboration features, while information consumers may<br>
only be able to run and adapt reports or charts that were<br>
previously defined by an administrator or power user.<br>
The predefined query models 56 are self-contained<br>
logical models of particular databases that are established<br>
to make query creation by less technical users easily and<br>
intuitive. The predefined query models 56 further abstract<br>
data from a database 20, exposing only those portions of<br>
the database 20 that is relevant to the group or groups of<br>
users who will use the particular query model 56. The<br>
predefined query models 56 include relevant tables from a<br>
database, fields within the database tables, and links<br>
between the database tables that together define a query.<br>
The predefined query models 56 form the basis for all<br>
queries created by users. In this way, the predefined<br>
query model 56 controls the elements in any database 20 to<br>
which any particular set of users will have access. In<br>
addition, the predefined query models 56 establish<br>
mechanisms that may restrict the type of queries that can<br>
be made by any group of users. In particular, the<br>
mechanisms define the maximum computer resources, or<br>
governors, that can be used to execute the queries, and<br>
allowable joins between tables to prevent run-away or<br>
malicious queries that could impact the integrity of the<br>
business intelligence portal 10.<br>
The portfolios 58 provide a file system for storing<br>
user created or obtained views 60. In addition, to<br>
internally generate views 60, the portfolios 58 may<br>
include, for example, views 60 of word processing<br>
documents, spread sheet documents, and web pages. The<br>
portfolios 58 are each a compound file capable of restoring<br>
a collection of views 60 or other related sets of data.<br>
The views 60 may be stored directly within the portfolio 58<br>
or linked to each other in the portfolio 58.<br>
Access to the portfolios 58 is determined by<br>
established security parameters for users and additionally<br>
by the creators of the views 60 in the portfolio 58. In<br>
one embodiment, users never see portfolios 58 to which they<br>
do not have access privileges. In addition, the portfolios<br>
58 may be customized to provide automatic notification to<br>
associated users when views 60 within the portfolio 58 have<br>
been updated or otherwise modified. In this way, security<br>
is made integral to the operation of the system which<br>
facilitates collaboration and information sharing within an<br>
enterprise.<br>
The views 60 provide data for displaying a wide<br>
variety of formats, such as, for example, tables, graphs,<br>
reports, pivots, and web pages. The views 60 may be either<br>
live views representing current data or snapshot views of<br>
data at a particular point in time. In addition, as<br>
described in more detail below, live views 60 may be<br>
scheduled to be updated automatically at regular intervals,<br>
updated when first opened, and the like. Snapshot views 60<br>
may be set to overwrite prior snapshots or to create a<br>
sequence of snapshot or rollover views 60 for historical<br>
analysis. The views 60 and portfolios 58 can be saved<br>
privately by a user or may be distributed or shared among<br>
one or more security groups 54 to facilitate collaboration<br>
and decision making.<br>
The security manager 36 manages security in the<br>
business intelligence portal 10. In particular, the<br>
security manager 36 includes predefined security tasks for<br>
generating and maintaining user profiles 52 and security<br>
groups 54. The security manager 36 also provides a<br>
security hierarchy that allows user profiles 62 and<br>
security groups 54 to inherit privileges from parent<br>
classes. In this way, a system administrator can easily<br>
establish and maintain security for the business<br>
intelligence portal 10.<br>
The query generator 38 provides graphical views of<br>
database elements to assist system administrators and power<br>
users in defining the query models 56. The predefined<br>
query models 56 each define the database connection, the<br>
family of tables and columns exposed from the database, the<br>
allowable join types and combinations, metadata, execution<br>
governors, and aliases for the query. The predefined query<br>
models 56 can be later adapted and used by a large range of<br>
users to perform safe, secure queries.<br>
The database access system 40 includes functionality<br>
and software for accessing and querying the databases 20<br>
and for returning query results to the server 30 for<br>
manipulation, analysis, and reporting by users. For the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the database access system 40<br>
includes a query scheduler 72, an SQL generator 74, a<br>
connection manager 76, and a Java database connection (JDBC)<br>
78.<br>
The query scheduler 72 initiates scheduled queries.<br>
As previously discussed, any view 60, including the data<br>
and calculations contained in the view 60, can be set to<br>
refresh from the database 20 according to several options,<br>
including specific time schedules. This allows views 60 to<br>
be easily refreshed to reflect the current state of the<br>
data and users to always work with the most up-to-date<br>
information. In addition, snapshot views 60 can be<br>
automatically scheduled to create an historical repository<br>
of snapshot views 60 based on the same query. Thus, for<br>
example, a view 60 may be scheduled for updates at 10:00<br>
p.m. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and automatically<br>
distributed to a group of users via a shared portfolio 58.<br>
The SQL generator 74 receives user-adapted or<br>
unadapted query models from a user and generates a textual<br>
SQL query for execution by the connection manager 76. In<br>
this way, query models which are graphically displayed and<br>
edited by users are automatically converted to executable<br>
database instructions and thereafter executed. This allows<br>
novice users and other information consumers with little or<br>
no programming knowledge to fully use and benefit from the<br>
business intelligence portal 10.<br>
In one embodiment, the SQL generator 74 includes<br>
dialog specific generators and an SQL parse tree to<br>
generate the textual SQL. The dialog specific generators<br>
correspond to the different types of databases 20 accessed<br>
by or used in connection with the business intelligence<br>
portal 10. The dialog-specific generators may include, for<br>
example, Oracle, Sybase, DB2, and MS SQL generators.<br>
The connection manager 76 receives textual SQL query<br>
requests from the SQL generator 74 and communicates with<br>
the databases 20 to perform the requested queries through<br>
the Java database connection (JDBC) 78. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the connection manager includes a modular query<br>
engine 80 including an intelligent dataset 82 and a library<br>
of data drivers 84. As described in more detail below, the<br>
data drivers 84 each execute a predefined database<br>
operation. The intelligent dataset 82 selects and orders<br>
data drivers 84 from the library as necessary to perform a<br>
query request. As a result, database access methods are<br>
standardized and the dataset need not be customized for<br>
each application.<br>
The cache manager 42 includes a cache 90 having a<br>
plurality of pages 92 and a process thread 94. The cache<br>
manager 42 receives data extracted from the databases 2 0 in<br>
response to query requests and feeds them into the pages<br>
92. The cache manager 42 runs a synchronously with the<br>
process thread 94 driving the cache 90 to feed data into<br>
the pages 92. It will be understood that data may be<br>
otherwise suitably received, stored, and initially<br>
processed by the server 30.<br>
The multidimensional model manager 44 generates and<br>
manipulates multidimensional storage models 100. As<br>
described in more detail below, the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100 utilizes a non-sparse architecture to<br>
minimize the size of the model 100. The reduced size of<br>
the model 100 improves processing times and allows<br>
efficient pivot and drill operations during data analysis.<br>
In addition, the model 100 uses an open architecture to<br>
allow calculations to be dynamically performed after the<br>
model has been constructed. As a result, users can create<br>
new calculations to analyze data intersections that were<br>
not anticipated during the original definition of the<br>
models 100. This reduces time and resources needed to<br>
support pivot and drill operations.<br>
The client administrator 46 provides a central point<br>
from which the portal 10 manages client administration.<br>
The client administrator 46 provides a zero-administration<br>
architecture that automatically manages deployment of<br>
client applications to maximize user performance and<br>
minimize network traffic, while assuring the latest<br>
applications are always used by the clients.<br>
The client tier 16 includes a plurality of clients<br>
110. The clients 110 may be local to or remote from each<br>
other and the server 30. In one embodiment, the clients<br>
110 provide all access, including system administration, to<br>
the server 30. As previously described, all client 110<br>
functions are controlled by a robust set of permissions<br>
stored on the server 30. Permissions are granted to both<br>
individual users and security groups of users. In this<br>
way, the robust functionality of the business intelligence<br>
portal 10 is appropriately controlled and metered out to<br>
all users across the enterprise without seeming overcomplex<br>
to less technical users.<br>
The client 110 includes a client API 112 and a<br>
graphical user interface (GUI) 114. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the client 110 is designed with all components<br>
being Java pieces, or Java beans. In this embodiment, as<br>
described in more detail below, the client 110 identifies<br>
its components when establishing a connection with the<br>
server 30. This allows efficient administration of the<br>
client 110 and integration of additional functionality into<br>
the client 110.<br>
The client API 112 comprises a set of Java classes<br>
that define how the client 110 communicates with the server<br>
30. Because the client API 112 allows any Java program to<br>
communicate with the server 30, an enterprise may<br>
efficiently add additional, custom capabilities for its<br>
clients 110.<br>
The graphical user interface 114 includes a set of<br>
administration panels 116, a set of user panels 118, a set<br>
of wizards 12 0, a query composer 122, a set of viewers 124,<br>
and a property inspector 126. The administrative and user<br>
panels 116 and 118 provide graphical displays for guiding<br>
administrators and users through their respective<br>
operations.<br>
The wizards 12 0 divide creation processes into one or<br>
more logical steps and guide administrations and users<br>
through the creation process. This assists novice users<br>
and other information consumers without detailed<br>
programming knowledge in performing queries and analyzing<br>
results. In this way, all users within an enterprise are<br>
able to efficiently use the business intelligence portal 10<br>
to extract meaningful data and thereby improve their area<br>
of operation within an enterprise.<br>
The query composer 122 specifies where data comes<br>
from, what substantive data to display, and how it is to be<br>
stored. The query composer 122 provides a graphical view<br>
of predefined query models 56 to allow users to intuitively<br>
understand and alter the models 56 to suit their particular<br>
needs. In one embodiment, the query composer 122 allows<br>
users to only see those data elements in a model 56 to<br>
which they have privileges. The query composer 122 saves<br>
user edits of a predefined query model 56 as a user-adapted<br>
query model 128 that can be uploaded to and executed by the<br>
server 30.<br>
The viewer 124 creates a combination of data views for<br>
tables, graphs, reports, pivots, web pages, and the like.<br>
The viewer 124 allows users to easily switch from any view<br>
60 of data to any other and to sort and filter data. The<br>
views 60 can also be exported to HTML for publication on a<br>
web server or for sharing in the catalog 32. As previously<br>
described, data views 60 may be live or snapshots. Views<br>
60 or portfolios 58 of views 60 can be saved privately<br>
within an individual user's own catalog area or may be<br>
distributed and shared among one or more security groups 54<br>
to facilitate collaboration and decision making.<br>
Within the viewer 124, a table viewer 130 displays<br>
information as a series of columns and rows. A table view<br>
typically serves as a starting point for developing ideas<br>
because it provides an overall idea of how information is<br>
organized. In the table view, users can add filters, add<br>
calculated fields, and add summary and subtotal<br>
information. Columns can be rearranged, hidden, and<br>
otherwise modified. Content can be sorted and viewed at<br>
different levels.<br>
A report viewer 132 displays data in a report format.<br>
A report view provides a robust, banded report format and<br>
facilitates automatic report generation and distribution.<br>
Users can freely arrange fields and columns in an<br>
interactive graphical design view of a report while adding<br>
calculations, subtotals, groupings, headers, footers,<br>
titles, and graphics.<br>
A graph viewer 134 displays graph views of data in a<br>
wide variety of 2-D and 3-D formats. These formats may<br>
include, for example, bar, pie, line, scatter, and radar<br>
graphs. While working with a graph, users can change the<br>
graph type or contents by filtering data, using a subset of<br>
the original data, and draw multidimensional data. The<br>
graph view can also be changed on the fly, by sorting the<br>
records in a different order, as well as changing the graph<br>
properties.<br>
A pivot viewer 136 provides pivot views displaying<br>
multidimensional, or cubed, data along multiple dimensions.<br>
This allows users to slice and dice information along<br>
disparate dimensions to gain different perspectives on the<br>
activities and performance of an enterprise. The pivot<br>
view supports hierarchies in the multiple dimensions which<br>
allows users to perform drill-down, drill-up and drill-<br>
through analysis. As described in more detail below, the<br>
multidimensional views are generated from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
A browser viewer 138 provides a built-in, cross-<br>
platform web browser. This allows users to access work<br>
products and web-based Internet or Intranet environments.<br>
Reports or objects created in other views can be exported<br>
to HTML for posting to websites or display through the<br>
browser interface.<br>
The property inspector 126 allows users to change<br>
display properties of a particular view. In one<br>
embodiment, the property inspector 126 is modeless. In<br>
this embodiment, the property inspector 126 applies the<br>
changes while on the screen to allow users to experiment<br>
with different configurations and attributes before closing<br>
the property inspector 122 .<br>
Together, the client 110 and server 3 0 of the business<br>
intelligence portal 10 add a strategic layer to an<br>
enterprise information structure and provides a single<br>
point of entry for integrated query, reporting, and<br>
analysis which are inherently extensible for a wide range<br>
of users. Because the business intelligence portal 10 may<br>
be fully integrated across an enterprise, the portal 10<br>
facilitates routine enterprise-wide analysis delivery and<br>
sharing of information. As a result, far more people<br>
within an enterprise will be able to make regular and<br>
productive use of data that already exists for the<br>
enterprise.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
initializing the business intelligence portal 10 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGURE. 2, . the method begins at step 200 in<br>
which a system administrator defines the user profiles 52.<br>
As previously described, the user profiles 52 provide<br>
permissions for users to utilize features within the<br>
system. Next, at step 202, the system administrator<br>
defines security groups 54. As previously described, final<br>
security rights and privileges that a user inherits are the<br>
union of his or her individual rights as defined in the<br>
user profiles 52 and the rights of each security group 54<br>
to which he or she belongs.<br>
Proceeding to step 2 04, the system administrator<br>
generates a database alias 50 for each of the databases 20.<br>
The database aliases 50 prevent direct user access to the<br>
databases in order to maintain data integrity and to make<br>
it possible for non-technical users to safely access<br>
corporate data without fear of corruption. The database<br>
aliases also serve to pool connections to the physical<br>
databases 2 0 and thereby reduce the number of database<br>
connections required to support a large number of clients<br>
110.<br>
Next, at step 206, the system administrator generates<br>
the predefined query models 56 using the query generator<br>
38. The predefined query models 56 control the elements in<br>
a database 20 to which any particular set of users will<br>
have access. In addition, the predefined query models 56<br>
restrict the types of queries that can be executed and<br>
define the maximum computer resources that can be used to<br>
execute the queries and the allowable joins between tables<br>
to prevent run-away or malicious queries.<br>
Step 206 leads to the end of the process by which the<br>
system administrator sets up the business intelligence<br>
portal 10 for use within an enterprise. As part of the<br>
setup process, permissions and queries for users have been<br>
defined in order to control access and distribution of data<br>
within the system.<br>
FIGURE 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
generating the predefined query models 56 in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, specified data within the model is<br>
automatically linked to the extent possible. In addition,<br>
database elements are graphically displayed to the system<br>
administrator to facilitate generation of the query model<br>
56.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3, the method begins at step 220<br>
in which the query generator 38 automatically identifies<br>
and displays to a system administrator the tables and<br>
columns of a database 20 for which a query is to be<br>
generated. Next, at step 222, the system administrator<br>
selects a subset of the tables and columns for a predefined<br>
query model 56.<br>
Proceeding to decisional step 224, the query generator<br>
3 8 determines whether the database 20 has full foreign key<br>
(FK)/primary key (PK) information. Full foreign<br>
key/primary key information allows data in disparate tables<br>
to be automatically linked. Accordingly, if the database<br>
20 includes full foreign key/primary key information, the<br>
Yes branch of decisional step 224 leads to step 226 in<br>
which child tables are automatically linked to parent<br>
tables in the predefined query model 56 using the foreign<br>
key/primary key information. Step 226 leads to the end of<br>
the process. At this point, the predefined query model 56<br>
can be saved or further edits can be made by the system<br>
administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 224, if full foreign<br>
key/primary key information is not available, the No branch<br>
of decisional step 224 leads to decisional step 228. At<br>
decisional step 228, the query generator 38 determines<br>
whether full primary key information is available from the<br>
database 20. Provision of full primary key information<br>
allows parent and child tables to be determined by a<br>
database table search. Accordingly, if full primary key<br>
information is available, the Yes branch of decisional step<br>
228 leads to step 226 where the database table search is<br>
performed to determine parent and child tables. After the<br>
parent and child tables are determined, they are<br>
automatically linked to generate the predefined query model<br>
56. The predefined query model may then be saved or<br>
further edited by the system administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 22 8, if full primary key<br>
information is not available, the No branch of decisional<br>
step 228 leads to decisional step 230. At decisional step<br>
230, the query generator determines whether unique index<br>
information capable of identifying parent and child tables<br>
is available from the database 20. If such unique index<br>
information is available, the Yes branch of decisional step<br>
230 leads to step 226. At step 226, the unique index<br>
information is used to search the database for parent and<br>
child tables. The query generator 38 then automatically<br>
links child and parent tables to generate the predefined<br>
query model 56. The predefined query model may then be<br>
saved or further edited by the system administrator.<br>
Returning to decisional step 230, if unique index<br>
information is not available from the database 20, the No<br>
branch of decisional step 230 leads to step 232. At step<br>
232, the system administrator manually identifies and links<br>
child and parent tables to generate the predefined query<br>
model 56. In this way, the predefined query models 56, are<br>
to the extent possible, automatically generated with<br>
minimal administrator interaction. It will be understood<br>
that database tables and other elements may be otherwise<br>
suitably linked.<br>
FIGURE 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
deploying and maintaining client applications in accordance<br>
with one embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, client applications are centrally deployed and<br>
maintained from the server 30 using a thin boot strap<br>
applet that is initially used to download Java classes<br>
forming the client applications to the client 110. After<br>
this, all upgrades to the client software are done<br>
automatically by the server 30 upon initiation of a new<br>
session by the client 110. Part of the installation/update<br>
procedure includes downloading a manifest file listing all<br>
names and versions of all modules and resources on a client<br>
110.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 4, the method begins at step 250<br>
in which a new connection to the server 3 0 is made by the<br>
client 110. At step 252, the boot strap agent on the<br>
client 110 transmits the user's manifest file to the server<br>
30.<br>
Proceeding to step 254, the server 3 0 compares the<br>
versions of all modules and resources listed in the<br>
manifest file to current versions of the corresponding<br>
files in the server 30. At decisional step 256, the server<br>
30 determines whether some or all of the modules or<br>
resources are outdated based on the comparison. If some or<br>
all of the modules or resources are outdated, the Yes<br>
branch of decisional step 256 leads to step 258. At step<br>
258, the server 30 generates an incremental update for the<br>
client 110. The incremental update includes only the<br>
modules that need to be updated.<br>
Next, at step 260, the server transmits the<br>
incremental update to the client 110. At step 262, the<br>
client 110 updates the client side applications based on<br>
the incremental update. At step 264, a new session is then<br>
launched for the update-to-date client 110. Returning to<br>
decisional step 256, if none of the client applications are<br>
outdated, the No branch of decisional step 256 also leads<br>
to step 264 in which a new session is launched. In this<br>
way, the server 3 0 determines what, if any, modules (or<br>
Java classes) are out-of-date, missing, or obsolete and<br>
then selectively pushes the correct modules to the user's<br>
machine along with an updated manifest. As a result, users<br>
never have to manually update client software and are able<br>
to easily roam between different work stations to log on<br>
without requiring their applications and data files to be<br>
reinstalled on each station. In addition, the client 110<br>
executes quickly and is always up-to-date while<br>
administration is centrally maintained and network traffic<br>
is minimized.<br>
FIGURE 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
adapting and executing a query model based on a predefined<br>
query model 56 in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, predefined query<br>
models 56 are generated and maintained on the server 3 0 by<br>
an administrator and provided to users upon request and<br>
verification of access privileges.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5, the method begins at step 280<br>
in which the server 30 receives a request from a user for a<br>
predefined query model 56. Next, at step 282, the server<br>
determines an accessible portion of the predefined query<br>
model 56 based on the user's privileges. The accessible<br>
portion is a portion of the query model 56 that may be<br>
viewed by the user. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
accessible portion of the predefined query model 56 may<br>
also be the portion of the query model editable by the<br>
user. Determination of the accessible portion of the<br>
predefined query model 56 may be accomplished by<br>
determining the user's privileges to the query model and<br>
then determining the accessible portion based on the user's<br>
privileges.<br>
In determining the accessible portion of the<br>
predefined query model 56, the server 30 may also determine<br>
a protected portion of the predefined query model 56. The<br>
protective portion is the remaining or other suitable<br>
portion of the predefined query model 56. As described in<br>
more detail below, the query composer 122 may conceal the<br>
protective portion of the predefined query model or<br>
otherwise prohibit edits to the protected portion of the<br>
predefined query model.<br>
Next, at step 284, the server 30 downloads the<br>
predefined query model 56 to the client 110. At step 286,<br>
the query composer 122 displays the accessible portion of<br>
the predefined query model 56 to the user. In one<br>
embodiment, the query composer 122 displays a graphical<br>
view of accessible data elements defining the predefined<br>
query model 56. In displaying the accessible portion, the<br>
query composer 122 may conceal the protected portion of the<br>
predefined query model 56 to prevent editing and/or viewing<br>
of that portion.<br>
Proceeding to step 288, the query composer 122<br>
receives user edits to the predefined query model 56. User<br>
edits may include the selection or deselection of database<br>
tables, columns in the database tables, and joins between<br>
the database tables. Next, at step 290, the query composer<br>
122 generates a user-adapted query model 128 based on user<br>
edits to the accessible portion of the predefined query<br>
model 56. At step 292, the user-adapted query model 128 is<br>
uploaded to the server 3 0 for execution.<br>
At step 294, the SQL generator 74 automatically<br>
generates a database query based on the user-adapted query<br>
model 128. The database query comprises textual SQL that<br>
can be executed by the connection manager 76 to perform the<br>
query. At step 296, the server 30 receives the results of<br>
the query. As previously described, the query results are<br>
initially stored in the server 3 0 by the cache manager 42.<br>
Proceeding to decisional step 298, if the query<br>
includes multidimensional analysis, the Yes branch of<br>
decisional step 298 leads to step 300 in which a<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is generated based on<br>
the results. At step 302, the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 is used to generate pivot, drill through, and<br>
other views as requested by the user.<br>
Returning to decisional step 298, if multidimensional<br>
analysis is not indicated, the No branch of decisional step<br>
298 leads to step 304 in which requested single dimensional<br>
views are generated based on the query results. Steps 302<br>
and 304 each lead to decisional step 306. At decisional<br>
step 306, the server 30 determines whether the user-adapted<br>
query model 128 will be stored for later reuse. If the<br>
user desires to save the query model 128, the Yes branch of<br>
decisional step 3 06 leads to step 3 08 in which the query<br>
model is saved to a selected portfolio 58 of the user or a<br>
security group 58 to which the user has access. Step 3 08<br>
and the No branch of decisional step 306 each lead to<br>
decisional step 310.<br>
At decisional step 310, the server 30 determines<br>
whether the query results are to be stored as an historical<br>
snapshot. If a user selects to store the results as a<br>
snapshot, the Yes branch of decisional step 310 leads to<br>
step 312 in which the query results are stored to a<br>
selected portfolio 58. Step 312 leads to the end of the<br>
process by which a predefined query model 56 is provided to<br>
a user for adaptation and customization. The predefined<br>
query model 56 is displayed and altered using a graphical<br>
view of data elements. This facilitates robust data<br>
analysis by all users and allows novice users to<br>
effectively use available information to improve operations<br>
within their organization.<br>
FIGURE 6 is a block diagram illustrating details of<br>
the query engine 80 in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In this embodiment, the query<br>
engine 80 includes a library of data drivers 84 and an<br>
intelligent dataset 82 operable in response to a query<br>
request to identify from the library necessary data drivers<br>
84 to perform the request. The intelligent dataset 82 is<br>
further operable to determine the necessary order of the<br>
data drivers 84 to perform the request, to generate a<br>
driver chain comprising the necessary data drivers 84 in<br>
the necessary order, and to execute in order the data<br>
drivers 84 in the driver chain.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 6, the intelligent dataset 82<br>
generates a driver chain 320 in response to a query<br>
request. The driver chain 320 includes data drivers 322<br>
necessary to perform the requested query. The data drivers<br>
322 are dynamically selected from the library of available<br>
data drivers 84 and ordered by the intelligent dataset 82<br>
based on the query request. In one embodiment, the data<br>
drivers 84 in the library are derived from a base class for<br>
which all interface methods call the next driver in the<br>
chain. In this embodiment, each data driver has a chain<br>
priority for placement in a same relative position within<br>
the chain 320. As used herein, the term each means every<br>
one of at least a subset of the identified items.<br>
For the illustrated embodiment, the driver chain 320<br>
includes data drivers D1, D2, D3, and D4. Data driver D1<br>
performs a fetch database operation which returns requested<br>
records. The returned records are next sorted by data<br>
driver D2 and indexed by data driver D3. Data driver D4<br>
then performs the requested search on the sorted and<br>
indexed data records. In this way, the modular query<br>
engine 80 employs standardized access methods to perform<br>
database queries. As a result, the portal 10 need not be<br>
customized for particular database queries and the cost to<br>
provide and maintain the business intelligence portal 10 is<br>
reduced.<br>
FIGURE 7 is a flow diagram illustrating operation of<br>
the modular query engine 80 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGURE<br>
7, the method begins at step 34 0 in which a query request<br>
is received by the intelligent dataset 82. Next, at step<br>
342, the intelligent dataset 82 dynamically selects data<br>
drivers 84 from the library necessary to perform the query<br>
request.<br>
Proceeding to step 344, the intelligent dataset 82<br>
determines the order of data drivers 84 necessary to<br>
perform the request. At step 346, the intelligent dataset<br>
82 dynamically constructs a driver chain comprising the<br>
necessary data drivers in the necessary order to perform<br>
the query request.<br>
Next, at step 348, the intelligent dataset executes<br>
the driver chain to perform the query request. Within the<br>
driver chain, the datasets 82 are executed in order with<br>
each calling a next driver 84 in the chain upon completion<br>
of its own execution. As a result, the query engine 80 and<br>
dataset 82 are application independent and can be easily<br>
modified to support new functionality by adding data<br>
drivers 84 to the library and programming the intelligent<br>
dataset 82 as to their functionality.<br>
FIGURE 8 is a block diagram illustrating details of a<br>
multidimensional storage model 10 0 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment,<br>
the storage model 100 utilizes a non-sparse architecture to<br>
minimize the size of the model 100. In addition, the<br>
storage model 100 uses an open architecture to allow<br>
calculations to be dynamically performed after the model<br>
100 is constructed.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 8, the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 comprises a slot 360 for each dimension and a<br>
slot 362 for a calculated dimension. The dimensional slots<br>
360 contain entries and associated data values extracted<br>
from a database while the calculated dimension slots 362<br>
contain data calculated based on the extracted data.<br>
For the illustrated embodiment, each dimension slot<br>
360 includes an entry storage 370 and a dimension storage<br>
372. The entry storage 370 contains a set of non-sparse<br>
entries 3 74 for the corresponding dimension. Preferably,<br>
only non-sparse entries are included. The entries 3 74<br>
represent combinatric dimensional values and each identify<br>
an associated data value 376. In one embodiment, each<br>
entry 3 74 includes a pointer to the associated data value<br>
376. Alternatively, the data values 376 can be stored<br>
along with the entries 374 in the entry storage 370. Use<br>
of the pointers and separate storage of the data value 3 76,<br>
however, improves efficiency and processing speed of the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
The dimension storage 372 includes the data values 3 76<br>
associated with entries 374 in the entry storage 370. The<br>
data values 376 represent unique dimensional values for<br>
each dimension.<br>
A set of interdimensional links 380 is provided for<br>
each non-sparse entry 374. Each interdimensional link<br>
identifies an intersection between non-sparse entries 374<br>
in different dimensional slots 360. The set of<br>
interdimensional links 380 includes one or more<br>
interdimensional links. In one embodiment, the<br>
interdimensional links 380 are bi-directional to allow<br>
efficient traversal between the dimensional slots 360 in<br>
either direction from an entry point.<br>
The interdimensional links 380 collectively identify<br>
all intersections between non-sparse entries 374 in the<br>
dimensional slots 360. Accordingly, all intersections,<br>
including non stored empty intersections, can be determined<br>
from the non-sparse entries 374 and traversal of the<br>
interdimensional links 380. In particular, a null<br>
intersection between database entries in a first and a<br>
second dimension is determined by the lack of the database<br>
entries in the model or the lack of interdimensional links<br>
380 connecting the entry 374 in the first dimension to the<br>
entry in the second dimension. Non-sparse intersections<br>
between entries 3 74 in a first and second dimension are<br>
determined by traversing the interdimensional links 3 80<br>
from the specified entry in the first dimension to the<br>
specified entry in the second dimension and then obtaining<br>
the data value 376 associated with the entry 374 in the<br>
second dimension. Data and information obtained by<br>
traversal of the interdimensional storage model 100 is<br>
output for further processing as described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
The calculated dimension 3 62 includes a set of<br>
calculated values 382. The calculated values 382 are<br>
values derived from predefined calculations requested by a<br>
user contemporaneously with the multidimensional storage<br>
model 100. Thus, while the multidimensional storage model<br>
100 provides an open architecture to allow calculations<br>
after its creation, contemporaneous calculations requested<br>
by the user with the model are precalculated and stored to<br>
minimize processing after creation of the model 100 and to<br>
improve the speed of multidimensional analysis.<br>
FIGURE 9 is a block diagram illustrating exemplary-<br>
data 400 and an exemplary multidimensional storage model<br>
402 for the exemplary data 400. Referring to FIGURE 9, the<br>
exemplary data 4 00 includes dimensions C1 and C2 and<br>
calculated dimension C3. Dimension Cl includes unique<br>
entry values A, B, and C while dimension C2 includes unique<br>
entry values D, E, F, G, and H. The calculated dimension<br>
C3 includes calculated data values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6<br>
corresponding to different predefined calculations.<br>
The exemplary storage model 402 includes dimensional<br>
slots 404 for dimensions Cl and C2 and calculated<br>
dimensional slot 406 for calculated dimension C3. In the<br>
Cl dimensional slot 404, the dimensional storage 410<br>
includes unique dimensional values A, B, and C. The entry<br>
storage 412 includes entries with which the data values are<br>
associated and pointers to the data values. Similarly, the<br>
C2 dimensional slot 404 includes unique data values D, E,<br>
F, G, and H in dimensional storage 414. Entry storage 416<br>
includes entries associated with the data values and<br>
pointers to the data values. Interdimensional links 420<br>
identify intersections between entries, and thus data, in<br>
the Cl and C2 dimensions. The calculated dimension 406<br>
includes calculated data values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6<br>
associated with predefined intersections of data in the Cl<br>
and C2 dimensions.<br>
From the exemplary storage model 402, it can be<br>
determined, for example, that entry values A and D in the<br>
Cl and C2 dimensions intersect in that they are connected<br>
by interdimensional links 420. It can be further<br>
determined that entry values C and D do no intersect in<br>
that they are not connected by interdimensional links 420.<br>
Entries are connected by interdimensional links if any one<br>
or a series of interdimensional links connect the entries.<br>
FIGURE 10 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for<br>
generating and using the multidimensional storage model 100<br>
in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 10, the method begins at step 440 in<br>
which the multidimensional storage model 100 is generated<br>
by the multidimensional model manager 44 in response to a<br>
query request and is based on results of the query request.<br>
The query request specifies the dimensions and data<br>
dimensions for the multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
In one embodiment, the multidimensional model manager<br>
44 generates the multidimensional storage model 100 by<br>
first fetching data records from the source. For each data<br>
record, the dimensional values and data values are then<br>
fetched. Thereafter, for each dimensional value of a data<br>
record the multidimensional model manager 44 determines if<br>
the dimensional value is present in entry storage 370, in<br>
which case it may be used. If the dimensional value is not<br>
present in the entry storage 370, an entry 374 is created<br>
for the dimensional value in entry storage 370 and the<br>
corresponding data value 3 76 stored in dimension storage<br>
372. In either case, the dimensions are next traversed<br>
from left to right to create interdimensional links 380 for<br>
the entries 374 in entry storage 370. Existing links are<br>
reused while links that are missing are created. In<br>
addition, for the right-most dimension, data values fetched<br>
for the record are added by the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44. It will be understood that the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 may be otherwise<br>
suitably generated.<br>
After the multidimensional storage model 100 is<br>
generated, step 440 proceeds to step 442. At step 442, the<br>
multidimensional model manager 44 receives a view request<br>
for a subset of the specified dimensions and/or data<br>
dimensions. Next, at step 444, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 determines traversals necessary to generate the<br>
view from the storage model 100 and a starting point for<br>
each traversal. The traversals are defined by the<br>
specified dimensions and the starting point on entry<br>
determined based on how the model 100 is organized.<br>
In one embodiment, the multidimensional model manager<br>
44 retrieves a first and a next record from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 using a bottom-up,<br>
right-to-left recursive movement. In this embodiment, to<br>
retrieve the first record, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 positions a first dimension selected for display<br>
to the first entry storage value. Next, all parent<br>
entries, which are those to the left of the first entry,<br>
are positioned to their first entry storage value. Child<br>
entries, which are those to the right of the selected<br>
dimension, are also positioned to their first entry storage<br>
value. For the first record, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 then retrieves values for dimensional entries at<br>
these positions. To retrieve the next record, the<br>
multidimensional manager 44 attempts to move the right-most<br>
child in the view. If the right-most child is movable, it<br>
is repositioned and the data values fetched at the current<br>
positions within the multidimensional storage model 100.<br>
If the right-most child is not movable, the<br>
multidimensional model manager 44 attempts to move the<br>
parent of that child, which is the entry immediately to the<br>
left of the child. If the parent is movable, it is<br>
repositioned and the data values fetched at their current<br>
positions in the multidimensional storage model 100. If<br>
the parent cannot be moved, an attempt is made to move the<br>
parent of that parent, which is the entry immediately to<br>
the left of the first parent, and the process repeated<br>
until no parents remain. At this point, the end of the<br>
process is reached. It will be understood that the<br>
traversals and starting points within the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100 may be otherwise suitably determined.<br>
Proceeding to step 446, the multidimensional model<br>
manager 44 traverses the multidimensional storage model 100<br>
from the entry point across connecting multidimensional<br>
links 380 to determine the existence and/or value at a<br>
specified intersection. At step 448, the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100 determines any value at the specified<br>
intersection. Next, at step 448, the multidimensional<br>
model manager 44 determines whether additional traversals<br>
exist for the model 100. If additional traversals exist,<br>
the Yes branch of decisional step 450 returns to step 446<br>
and the remaining traversals are performed and<br>
intersectional values calculated until all traversals have<br>
been completed. The No branch of decisional step 450 then<br>
leads to step 452.<br>
At step 452, data and information output from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is summarized and<br>
sorted. It will be understood that the multidimensional<br>
storage model 100 may be otherwise configured to presort<br>
and summarize data. However, by separating the traversal<br>
operation from the summarizing and sorting operations,<br>
processing efficiency is improved.<br>
Next, at step 454, information output from the<br>
multidimensional storage model 100 is graphically displayed<br>
to the user in a requested view by the viewers 124 on the<br>
client 110. Proceeding to decisional step 456, if<br>
additional views are requested, the Yes branch returns to<br>
step 442 in which the view request and specified dimensions<br>
are received and the process repeated until all requested<br>
views have been completed and displayed to the user. At<br>
this point, the No branch of decisional step 456 leads to<br>
the end of the process. In this way, the business<br>
intelligence portal 10 provides a multidimensional storage<br>
model 100 of reduced size and improved processing speeds<br>
that support efficient pivot and drill operations during<br>
data analysis. In addition, a user can create new<br>
calculations to analyze data intersections that were not<br>
anticipated during the original definition of the model.<br>
This reduces time and resources needed to support pivot and<br>
drill operations. The additional views may include pivot<br>
views and data drilling for high and low level analysis.<br>
FIGURE 11 is a screen diagram illustrating a display<br>
of related window 480 in accordance with one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIGURE 11, the display<br>
window 480 includes a menu bar 486 with a variety of pull<br>
down menus 488 disposed along a top edge of the display<br>
window 480. A tool bar 490 is disposed immediately below<br>
the menu bar 486.<br>
The display window 480 further includes a catalog<br>
window 492 and a portfolio window 494 adjacent the catalog<br>
window 492. The catalog window 492 displays a file<br>
hierarchy within the catalog 32. The portfolio window 494<br>
displays the views linked by the action portfolio.<br>
Within the portfolio window 494, each of the views is<br>
separately displayed in a discrete view window 4 96.<br>
Storage of the views in discrete files linked by the<br>
portfolio and display of the related views within the<br>
portfolio window 494 allows related documents to be easily<br>
organized together and efficiently displayed to a user. In<br>
particular, the portfolio window 494 provides a common<br>
window with a single data interface (SDI). The discrete<br>
view windows 496 are displayed within the common window in<br>
a multiple data interface (MDI). It will be understood<br>
that other types of related components. may be discretely<br>
stored and linked together for display through a compound<br>
file.<br>
FIGURE 12 is a screen diagram illustrating a display<br>
window 500 including view buttons for navigating between<br>
related views in a portfolio in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGURE<br>
12, the display window 500 includes a menu bar 502 with a<br>
variety of pull down menus 504 disposed along a top edge of<br>
the display window 500. A tool bar 506 is disposed<br>
immediately below the menu bar 502. The display window 500<br>
includes a catalog window 508 and a portfolio window 510 as<br>
previously described in connection with catalog window 492<br>
and portfolio window 494.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, view windows 512 are<br>
maximized with the portfolio window 510 to provide<br>
optimized viewing. To allow navigation between the<br>
maximized windows, view buttons 514 are provided in<br>
response to maximization of a window 512 and displayed as<br>
tabs along a top edge of the portfolio window 510. The<br>
view buttons 514 are each operable to display an associated<br>
window 512 as the active window in response to activation.<br>
This allows users to quickly and easily navigate between<br>
the windows. As a result, users need to constantly move,<br>
close, open, and resize windows to view related data stored<br>
in disparate files. The view buttons may be otherwise<br>
displayed or generated in response to other suitable<br>
events. For example, the view buttons may be generated any<br>
time a first window becomes at least substantially hidden<br>
from display by an overlying window. Thus, as soon as a<br>
user indicates that a window should be maximized,<br>
positioned, or displayed to cover a window, a view button<br>
514 may be generated for the window to be covered. The<br>
view buttons 514 may be positioned independently of a<br>
corresponding window. Thus, they may be displayed adjacent<br>
to or remote from a corresponding window.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with<br>
several embodiments, various changes and modifications may<br>
