BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to novel compounds, to a process for their preparation, their use and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds. The novel compounds are useful in therapy, and in particular for the treatment of pain, anxiety and functional gastrointestinal disorders.<br>
2. Discussion of Relevant Art<br>
The receptor has been identified as having a role in many bodily functions such as circulatory and pain systems. Ligands for the δ receptor may therefore find potential use as analgesics, and/or as antihypertensive agents. Ligands for the δ receptor have also been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
The identification of at least three different populations of opioid receptors (µ, δ and Κ) is now well established and all three are apparent in both central and peripheral nervous systems of many species including man. Analgesia has been observed in various animal models when one or more of these receptors has been activated.<br>
With few exceptions, currently available selective opioid δ ligands are peptidic in nature and are unsuitable for administration by systemic routes. One example of a non-peptidic δ-agonist is SNC80 (Bilsky E.J. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 273(1), pp. 359-366 (1995)).<br>
Many δ agonist compounds that have been identified in the prior art have many disadvantages in that they suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and are not analgesic when administered by systemic routes. Also, it has been documented that many of these δ agonist compounds show significant convulsive effects when administered systemically.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,130,222 to Roberts et al. describes some δ-agonists. However, there is still a need for improved δ-agonists.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br><br>
The compounds of the invention are found to be active towards S receptors in warm-blooded animal, e.g., human. Particularly the compounds of the invention are found to be effective S receptor ligands. In vitro assays, infra, demonstrate these surprising activities, especially with regard to agonists potency and efficacy as demonstrated in the rat brain functional assay and/or the human S receptor functional assay (low). This feature may be related to in vivo activity and may not be linearly correlated with binding affinity. In these in vitro assays, a compound is tested for their activity toward S receptors and 1C50 is obtained to determine the selective activity for a particular compound towards S receptors. In the current context, IC50 generally refers to the concentration of the compound at which 50% displacement of a standard radioactive S receptor ligand has been observed.<br><br>
The activities of the compound towards ic and p. receptors are also measured in a similar assay.<br><br><br>

A.	Human 293 S cells expressing cloned human K, 5 and ~i receptors and neomycin resistance are grown in suspension at 370C and 5% CO2 in shaker flasks containing calcium-free DMEM1O% FBS, 5% BCS, 0.1% Pluronic F-68, and 600 jig/mi geneticin.<br><br>
B.	Rat brains are weighed and rinsed in ice-cold PBS (containing 2.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The brains are homogenized with a polytron for 30 sec (rat) in ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5mM EDTA, with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added just prior use to 0.5MmM from a 0.5M stock in DMSO:ethanol).<br><br><br>
Membrane preparation<br><br>
Cells are pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5 mM EDTA, with PMSF added just prior to use to 0.1 mM from a 0.1 M stock in ethanol), incubated on ice for 15 mm, then homogenized with a polytron for 30 sec. The suspension is spun at iQOOg (max) for 10 min at 40C. The supernatant is saved on ice and the pellets resuspended and spun as before. The supernatants from both spins are combined and spun at 46,000 g(max) for 30 mm. The pellets are resuspended in cold Tris buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.0) and spun again. The final pellets are resuspended in membrane buffer ( 50 mM Tris, 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.0). Aliquots (1 ml) in polypropylene tubes are frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at -700C until use. The protein concentrations are determined by a modified Lowry assay with sodium dodecyl sulfate.<br><br><br>
Binding assays<br><br>
Membranes are thawed at 370C, cooled on ice, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge needle, and diluted into binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 mM MgCI2, 1 mg/mI BSA (Sigma A-7888), pH 7.4, which is stored at 40C after filtration through a 0.22 m filter, and to which has been freshly added 5 jig/mI aprotinin, 10 jiM bestatin, 10 p.M diprotin A, no DT'T).

The tubes are vortexed and incubated at 250C for 60-75 mm, after which time the contents are rapidly vacuum-filtered and washed with about 12 mlltube iced wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mM MgCI2) through GF/B filters (Whatman) presoaked for at least 2h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The radioactivity (dpm) retained on the filters is measured with a beta counter after soaking the filters for at least 1 2h in minivials containing 6-7 ml scintillation fluid. If the assay is set up in 96-place deep well plates, the filtration is over 96-place PEI-soaked unifilters, which are washed with 3 x 1 ml wash buffer, and dried in an oven at 550C for 2h. The filter plates are counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 50 p.1 MS-20 scintillation fluid/well.<br><br><br>
Functional Assays<br><br>
The agonist activity of the compounds is measured by determining the degree to which the compounds receptor complex activates the binding of GTP to 0-proteins to which the receptors are coupled. In the GTP binding assay, GTP[y]355 is combined with test compounds and membranes from HEK-293 S cells expressing the cloned human opioid receptors or from homogenised rat and mouse brain. Agonists stimulate GTP[y1135S binding in these membranes. The EC50 and ~ values of compounds are determined from dose-response curves. Right shifts of the dose response curve by the delta antagonist naltrindole are performed to verify that agonist activity is mediated through delta receptors. For human 5 receptor functional assays, EC5o (low) is measured when the human 5 receptors used in the assay were expressed at lower levels in comparison with those used in determining EC50 (high). The E,~ values were determined in relation to the standard S agonist SNC80, i.e., higher than 100% is a compound that have better efficacy than SNC8O.<br><br><br>
Procedure for rat brain GTP<br><br>
Rat brain membranes are thawed at 370C, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge blunt-end needle and diluted in the GTPyS binding (50 mM Hepes, 20 mM NaOH, 100 mM NaCI, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCI2, pH 7.4, Add fresh: 1 mM DTT, 0.1%<br><br><br><br><br><br>

BSA). 120p.M GDP final is added membranes dilutions. The EC5O and Emax of compounds are evaluated from 10-point dose-response curves done in 300p.l with the appropriate amount of membrane protein (20p.g/well) and 100000-130000 dpm of GTPy"S per well (0.11 -0.l4nM). The basal and maximal stimulated binding are determined in absence and presence of 3 p.M SNC-80<br><br><br>
Data analysis<br><br>
The specific binding (SB) was calculated as TB-NS, and the SB in the presence of various test compounds was expressed as percentage of control SB. Values of IC50 and Hill coefficient (nH) for ligands in displacing specifically bound radioligand were calculated from logit plots or curve fitting programs such as Ligand, GraphPad Prism, SigmaPlot, or ReceptorFit. Values of K, were calculated from the Cheng-Prussoff equation. Mean ± S.E.M. values of IC50, K1 and nH were reported for ligands tested in at least three displacement curves.<br><br>
Based on the above testing protocols, we find that the compounds of the present invention and some of the intermediates used in the preparation thereof are active toward human S receptors. Biological activity of the compounds and selected intermediates of the present invention is indicated in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br><br>

DETERMINATION OF MECHANO-ALLODYNIA USING VON FREY TESTING<br><br>
Testing is performed between 08:00 and I 6:OOh using the method described by Chaplan et al. (1994). Rats are placed in Plexiglas cages on top of a wire mesh bottom which allows access to the paw, and are left to habituate for 10-15 mm. The area tested is the mid-plantar left hind paw, avoiding the less sensitive foot pads. The paw is touched with a series of 8 Von Frey hairs with logarithmically incremental stiffness (0.41, 0.69, 1.20,2.04, 3.63, 5.50, 8.51, and 15.14 grams; Stoelting, Ill, USA). The von Frey hair is applied from underneath the mesh floor perpendicular to the plantar surface with sufficient force to cause a slight buckling against the paw, and held for approximately 6-8 seconds. A positive response is noted if the paw is sharply withdrawn. Flinching immediately upon removal of the hair is also considered a positive response. Ambulation is considered an ambiguous response, and in such cases the stimulus is repeated.<br><br><br>
TESTING PROTOCOL<br><br>
The animals are tested on postoperative day 1 for the FCA-treated group. The 50% withdrawal threshold is determined using the up-down method of Dixon (1980).<br><br><br>
PCT/SE2003/001707<br>
WO 2004/041802<br>

Testing is started with the 2.04 g hair, in the middle of the series. Stimuli are always presented in a consecutive way, whether ascending or descending. In the absence of a paw withdrawal response to the initially selected hair, a stronger stimulus is presented; in the event of paw withdrawal, the next weaker stimulus is chosen. Optimal threshold calculation by this method requires 6 responses in the immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold, and counting of these 6 responses begins when the first change in response occurs, e.g. the threshold is first crossed. In cases where thresholds fall outside the range of stimuli, values of 15.14 (normal sensitivity) or 0.41 (maximally allodynic) are respectively assigned. The resulting pattern of positive and negative responses is tabulated using the convention, X = no withdrawal; 0 = withdrawal, and the 50% withdrawal threshold is interpolated using the formula:<br><br><br>
50% g threshold = l0~~ k5) / 10,000<br><br><br>
where Xf value of the last von Frey hair used (log units); k tabular value (from Chaplan et al. (1994)) for the pattern of positive / negative responses; and 6= mean difference between stimuli (log units). Here 8 = 0.224.<br><br>
Von Frey thresholds are converted to percent of maximum possible effect (% MPE), according to Chaplan et al. 1994. The following equation is used to compute %MPE:<br><br><br>
% MPE = Drua treated threshold (g) - allodvnia threshold (~) X 100<br><br>
Control threshold (g) - allodynia threshold (g)<br><br><br>
ADMINISTRATION OF TEST SUBSTANCE<br><br>
Rats are injected (subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously or orally) with a test substance prior to von Frey testing, the time between administration of test compound and the von Frey test varies depending upon the nature of the test compound.<br><br><br>
Writhina Test<br><br><br>
WO 2004/04 1802	PCT/SE2003/001707<br><br><br>

Acetic acid will bring abdominal contractions when administered intraperitoneally in mice. These will then extend their body in a typical pattem. When analgesic drugs are administered, this described movement is less frequently observed and the drug selected as a potential good candidate.<br><br>
A complete and typical Writhing reflex is considered only when the following elements are present: the animal is not in movement; the lower back is slightly depressed; the plantar aspect of both paws is observable. In this assay, compounds of the present invention demonstrate significant inhibition of writhing responses after oral dosing of 1-100 pmollkg.<br><br><br>
(i) Solutions preparation<br><br>
Acetic acid (AcOH): 120 p.L of Acetic Acid is added to 19.88 ml of distilled water in order to obtain a final volume of 20 ml with a final concentration of 0.6% AcOH. The solution is then mixed (vortex) and ready for injection.<br><br><br>
Comnound (drug): Each compound is prepared and dissolved in the most suitable vehicle according to standard procedures.<br><br><br>
(ii) Solutions administration<br><br>
The compound (drug) is administered orally, intraperitoneally (i.p.), subcutaneously (s.c.) or intravenously (i.v.)) at 10 ml/kg (considering the average mice body weight) 20, 30 or 40 minutes (according to the class of compound and its characteristics) prior to testing. When the compound is delivered centrally:<br><br>
Intraventricularly (i.c.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.) a volume of 5 jiL is administered. The AcOH is administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in two sites at 10 mI/kg<br><br>
(considering the average mice body weight) immediately prior to testing.<br><br><br>
(iii) Testing<br><br>
The animal (mouse) is observed for a period of 20 minutes and the number of occasions (Writhing reflex) noted and compiled at the end of the experiment. Mice are kept in individual "shoe box" cages with contact bedding. A total of 4 mice are usually observed at the same time: one control and three doses of drug.<br><br><br>

ADDITIONAL IN ViVO TESTING PROTOCOLS<br><br>
Subjects and housing<br><br>
10	Naive male Sprague Dawley rats (175-200g) are housed in groups of 5 in a temperature controlled room (220C, 40-70% humidity, 12-h light/dark). Experiments are performed during the light phase of the cycle. Animals have food and water ad libitum and are sacrificed immediately after data acquisition.<br><br><br>
Samnle<br><br>
Compound (Drug) testing includes groups of rats that do not receive any treatment and others that are treated with E. coli lipopolysaccharide(LPS). For the LPS-treated experiment, four groups are injected with LPS, one of the four groups is then vehicle-treated whilst the other three groups are injected with the drug and its vehicle. A second set of experiments are conducted involving five groups of rats; all of which receive no LPS treatment. The naive group receives no compound (drug) or vehicle; the other four groups are treated with vehicle with or without drug. These are performed to determine anxiolytic or sedative effects of drugs which can contribute to a reduction in USV.<br><br><br>
Administration of LPS<br><br>
Rats are allowed to habituate in the experimental laboratory for 15-20 mm prior to treatment. Inflammation is induced by administration of LPS (endotoxin of gram-negative E. coli bacteria serotype 011 1:B4, Sigma). LPS (2.4jig) is injected intracerebro-ventricularly (i.c.v.), in a volume of 1 Ojil, using standard stereotaxic surgical techniques under isoflurane anaesthesia. The skin between the ears is pushed rostrally and a longitudinal incision of about 1cm is made to expose the skull surface.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/041802	PCT/SE2003/001707<br><br><br>
32<br><br>
The puncture site is determined by the coordinates: 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral (left) to the lambda (sagittal suture), and 5 mm below the surface of the skull (vertical) in the lateral ventricle. LPS is injected via a sterile stainless steel needle (26-G 3/8) of 5 mm long attached to a 100-p.l Hamilton syringe by polyethylene tubing (PE2O; 10-15 cm). A 4 mm stopper made from a cut needle (20-G) is placed over and secured to the 26-G needle by silicone glue to create the desired 5mm depth.<br><br>
Following the injection of LPS, the needle remains in place for an additional 10 s to allow diffusion of the compound, then is removed. The incision is closed, and the rat is returned to its original cage and allowed to rest for a minimum of 3.5h prior to testing.<br><br><br>
Experimental setup for air-puff stimulation<br><br>
The rats remains in the experimental laboratory following LPS injection and compound (drug) administration. At the time of testing all rats are removed and placed outside the laboratory. One rat at a time is brought into the testing laboratory and placed in a clear box (9 x 9 x 18 cm) which is then placed in a sound-attenuating ventilated cubicle measuring 62(w) x35(d) x46(h) cm (BRS/LVE, Div. Tech-Serv mc). The delivery of air-puffs, through an air output nozzle of 0.32 cm, is controlled. by a system (AirStim, San Diego Intruments) capable of delivering puffs of air of fixed duration (0.2 s) and fixed intensity with a frequency of I puff per lOs. A maximun of 10 puffs are administered, or until vocalisation starts, which ever comes first. The first air puff marks the start of recording.<br><br><br>
Experimental setup for and ultrasound recording<br><br>
The vocalisations are recorded for 10 minutes using microphones (G.R.A.S. sound and vibrations, Vedbaek, Denmark) placed inside each cubicle and controlled by LMS (LMS CADA-X 3.5B, Data Acquisition Monitor, Troy, Michigan) software. The frequencies between 0 and 32000Hz are recorded, saved and analysed by the same software (LMS CADA-X 3.5B, Time Data Processing Monitor and LJPA (User Programming and Analysis)).<br><br><br>

Comnounds (Drugs)<br><br>
All compounds (drugs) are pH-adjusted between 6.5 and 7.5 and administered at a volume of 4 ml/kg. Following compound (drug) administration, animals are returned to their original cages until time of testing.<br><br><br>
Analysis<br><br>
The recording is run through a series of statistical and Fourier analyses to filter (between 20-24k.Hz) and to calculate the parameters of interest. The data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is assessed using T-test for comparison between naive and LPS-treated rats, and one way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test (post-hoc) for drug effectiveness. A difference between groups is considered significant with a minimum p value of £0.05. Experiments are repeated a minimum of two times.<br><br><br>
