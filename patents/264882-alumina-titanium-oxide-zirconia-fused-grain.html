				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to alumina - titanium oxide - zirconia fused grains, to a method of manufacturing such grains, and to a slide gate including such grains.<br>
Slide gates are parts used in continuous casting of steel for opening and closing distributors or outlet orifices from casting ladles in fluid communication via a sliding nozzle with ingot molds. Slide gates must therefore present good mechanical strength, in particular against thermal shocks and spalling, and good chemical resistance, in particular against corrosion.<br>
Conventionally, slide gates are obtained by sintering a mixture of alumina-zirconia fused grains and zirconia-mullite fused grains. The alumina-zirconia / zirconia-mullite composite is particularly good at withstanding thermal shocks because of its reinforcement by microcracking. During heating, the allotropic transformation of zirconia is accompanied by a large change in volume. This dimensional variation leads to the formation of microcracks. These microcracks also appear at the interfaces between zirconia-mullite particles and the alumina-zirconia matrix because of the large difference in thermal expansion between alumina-zirconia (a1000oC = 9.6 X 10-6/°C) and zirconia-mullite (a 1000°c = 6.9 X 10-6/°C). These two phenomena lead to the part being microcracked, thereby increasing its capacity for absorbing energy in the event of thermal shocks.<br>
Nevertheless, zirconia-mullite presents the disadvantage of presenting low resistance to corrosion, thus constituting the weak point of the composite.<br>
There thus exists a need for a novel grain suitable for taking the place of mullite-zirconia grain when manufacturing slide gates, that enables slide gates to be made that present improved resistance to corrosion. The object of the invention is to satisfy that need.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of an alumina -titanium oxide - zirconia fused grain presenting, for a total of 100%, the following chemical composition:<br>
• A12O3: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 50%, preferably less than 35%;<br>
.TiO2: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 40%, preferably less than 30%, more preferably less than 25%;<br>
2<br><br>
•	ZrO2: more than 50%, and preferably less than 70%, or less than 61%;<br>
•	impurities: less than 2%;<br>
the percentages being percentages by weight based on the oxides, the grain not presenting a TiO2 phase, and more than 98% by weight of the zirconia being monoclinic.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition of the grain comprises about 60% of ZrO2, about 20% of A12O3, and about 18% to 20% of TiO2.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have found that substituting mullite-zirconia grains with grains of the invention makes it possible to manufacture composite slide gates that withstand corrosion better, without degrading ability to withstand thermal shocks.<br>
In addition, the inventors have found that the absence of the TiO2 phase improves resistance to corrosion. The grain of the invention preferably presents the following phases only:<br>
•	A12O3 with Zr5Ti7024 and/or,<br>
•	(ZrTiO4 or ZrO2) with aluminum titanate Al2TiO5.<br>
A preferred grain presents the phases Al2O3-Zr5Ti7O24, the most preferred grain presenting the phases ZrO2-Al2TiO5.<br>
Finally, the grain of the invention can be melted by electrofusion, thus enabling large quantities of grains to be manufactured with advantageous efficiency. The price/performance ratio is thus excellent.<br>
Preferably, the fused grain of the invention further includes one or more of the following optional characteristics:<br>
•	its chemical composition further presents a quantity of tin oxide (SnO2) of more<br>
than 2%, preferably more than 5%, and/or less than 10%, the ranges of the other<br>
ingredients not being changed. For a total of 100%, the chemical composition of the grain<br>
is then as follows, percentages being by weight based on the oxides:<br>
3<br><br>
•	A12O3: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 50%,<br>
preferably less than 35%, or less than 20%;<br>
•	TiO2: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 40%,<br>
preferably less than 30%, more preferably less than 25%;<br>
•	ZrO2: more than 50%, and preferably less than 76%, or less than 70%;<br>
•	SnO2: more than 2%, preferably more than 5%, and less than 10%, or less<br>
than 6%;<br>
•	impurities: less than 2%;<br>
•	the zirconia may be combined with the tin oxide;<br>
•	more than 98% of weight by the zirconia is in monoclinic phase.<br>
Whatever the embodiment, the grain of the invention comprises preferably at least 0.1%, preferably at least 0.5% and/or less than 3% of MgO, in percentages by weight based on the oxides, the ranges of the other ingredients mentioned above not being changed.<br>
For a total of 100%, chemical compositions of the grain are then as follows, percentages being by weight based on the oxides:<br>
. A12O3: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 50%, preferably less than 35%, or less than 20%;<br>
•	TiO2: more than 10%, preferably more than 15%, and less than 40%,<br>
preferably less than 30%, more preferably less than 25%;<br>
•	ZrO2: more than 50%, and preferably less than 76%, or less than 70%;<br>
•	SnO2: optional;<br>
•	MgO: optional;<br>
•	impurities: less than 2%;<br>
4<br><br>
When SnO2 is present, its concentration is preferably more than 2%, preferably 5%, and/or less than 10%, or 6%.<br>
When MgO is present, its concentration is preferably more than 0.1%, preferably 0.5%, and/or less than 3%, or 2.5%.<br>
The "impurities" comprise ingredients other than SnO2, TiO2, A12O3, ZrO2, and, when explicitly mentioned MgO, and in particular compounds forming part of the group comprising oxides, nitrides, oxynitrides, carbides, oxycarbides, carbonitrides, and metallic species of sodium and other alkalies, irons, silicon, vanadium, and chromium. Hafnium oxide which is naturally present in sources of zirconia at concentrations of less than 2% is not considered as an impurity. Residual carbon, expressed as C, forms part of the impurities in the composition of grains of the invention.<br>
It is considered that an impurity content of less than 2% does not eliminate the technical effect procured by the invention.<br>
The invention also provides a method of fabricating alumina - titanium oxide -zirconia fused grains of the invention, the method comprising the following successive steps:<br>
a)	mixing raw materials to form an initial charge;<br>
b)	melting the initial charge to obtain a molten liquid;<br>
c)	cooling said molten liquid so that the molten liquid is entirely solidified in less<br>
than 3 minutes, preferably less than 1 minute, more preferably less than 15 seconds, so as<br>
to obtain a solid mass;<br>
d)	optionally grinding said solid mass so as to obtain a mixture of grains.<br>
According to the invention, the raw materials are selected in step a) so that the grains obtained in step d) are in accordance with the invention.<br>
Preferably, one or several of the oxides from A12O3, TiO2, ZrO2 SnO2, MgO, their precursors and their mixtures are intentionally, that is to say systematically and methodically, added in step a), in quantities guaranteeing that the grains obtained in step c) are in accordance with the invention.<br>
5<br><br>
Any conventional method of manufacturing alumina - titanium oxide - zirconia fused grains can be implemented, providing the composition of the initial charge enables grains to be obtained that presents a composition in accordance with that of grains of the invention.<br>
In step a), the titanium may be introduced in any form, in particular in metallic form or in the form of a zirconia-titanium oxide alloy, or of alumina titanate.<br>
Compositions enabling phases of Zr5Ti7024 and/or of alumina titanate Al2TiO5 and/or of ZrTiO4 to be obtained while avoiding a TiO2 phase can easily be determined by the person skilled in the art from the ternary Al2O3-TiO2-ZrO2 phase diagram, and more precisely along the pseudo-binary Al2TiO5-ZrO2 diagram.<br>
The contents of the various raw materials in the initial charge should also be determined to take account of the reduction in the content of SnO2 during heating in step b). The magnitude of this reduction as a function of heating conditions is well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In step b), it is preferable to use an electric arc furnace, however any known furnace could be envisaged, such as an induction furnace or a plasma furnace, providing it enables the initial charge to be melted completely. Heating is preferably performed under inert conditions, e.g. under argon, or under oxidizing conditions, preferably at atmospheric pressure.<br>
In step c), cooling is rapid, i.e. so that the molten liquid solidifies completely in less than 3 minutes. Preferably, it is the result of casting into CS molds as described in US 3 993 119 or from quenching. Advantageously, such rapid cooling avoids a TiO2 phase appearing. Slow cooling would on the contrary lead to phases dissociating and thus produce the species: Al2O3+TiO2 or ZrO2+TiO2.<br>
In step d), the solid mass is ground, using conventional techniques.<br>
Finally, the invention provides a slide gate made of sintered composite material presenting alumina - titanium oxide - zirconia fused grains of the invention bonded by an alumina-zirconia matrix.<br>
The following examples are provided by way of illustration and they do not limit the scope of the invention.<br>
6<br><br>
Reference 1 (ref. 1) is a ZrO2-mullite product sold by the supplier Treibacher Schleifmittel.<br>
Reference 2 (ref. 2) is a product known as FAZ 40. This product is an alumina-zirconia sold by the supplier Sowa Denko.<br>
To prepare the samples of Examples 1, 2, and 3, powders were mixed in a Turbula mixer for 2 hours and then melted in a graphite crucible under an atmosphere of argon in an induction furnace. Cooling depends on the inertia of the furnace. That produced samples that were generally small, requiring post-melting oxidation heat treatment.<br>
For the other examples and the reference compositions, the powder mixtures were melted using an electric arc furnace, under air, with oxidizing electrical operation. Cooling was controlled using various methods (CS mold enabling the sample to cool rapidly, ingot cooled in free air, or reheater unit).<br>
The raw materials were as follows: CC10 monoclinic zirconia sold by SEPR, AR75 alumina from Pechiney, tin oxide from Keeling &amp; Walker Ltd., TiO2 rutile from CRB GmbH.<br>
The chemical composition, given in percentages by weight based on the oxides were measured using conventional methods: chemical analysis was performed by X-ray fluorescence.<br>
The crystal phases present in the refractory compositions were determined by X-ray diffraction. In Table 1,"~" means "traces".<br>
The coefficient of expansion at 1000°C "a" was measured on pellets prepared from powders having the same size fraction (median diameter d 
Grain corrosion by slag was evaluated with an optical microscope after calcining a grain-slay mixture at 1450°C. The slag was essentially constituted by SiO2 (40%), CaO (40%), Na2O (10%), and A12O3 (5%). It presented a basicity index (CaO+MgO)/SiO2 of 1. Although the grains were not intended to come into contact with slag, corrosion in slag serves to impose particularly severe conditions, making it possible to measure corrosion<br>
7<br><br>
that is significant. A score "R" for resistance to corrosion was given in the range 0 to 4, with the resistance being better for higher R scores.<br>
The allotropic transformation temperature "T" of the tested grains needs to be as close as possible to that of reference 2 (alumina-zirconia grains) so that microcracking is effective in improving the ability of the composite material made from a mixture of these two types of grain to absorb energy during thermal shocks, as explained in the introduction. In contrast, and for the same reason, the coefficient of expansion at 1000°C, "a" of a tested material should be as different as possible from that of reference 2.<br>
"V" designates the rate of solidification of the molten liquid: "H" and "D" meaning "a few hours" and "a few days" respectively. "
The results are summarized in Table 1 below.<br>
8<br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
Table 1 above shows that the grains of the invention present coefficients of expansion "a" that are far enough removed from those of alumina-zirconia grains (reference 2) to generate microcracking in sintered composite materials made from those two types of grain. Grains of the invention can thus take the place of prior art mullite-zirconia grains for fabricating composite material slide gates, the alumina - titanium oxide - zirconia fused grains of the invention being bonded together by an alumina-zirconia matrix.<br>
Table 1 also shows the advantage of rapid cooling (Examples 4 and 7), and also the drawback of the presence of a TiO2 phase (Example 3), in improving resistance to corrosion.<br>
Other measurements have also shown that grains of the invention present a coefficient of expansion that varies as a function of temperature in a manner that is similar to that of zirconia-mullite grains. In particular, the allotropic transformation of zirconia leads to a break in the variation of the coefficient of expansion. In order to ensure that this break takes place at a temperature that is as high as possible, advantageously substantially at the same temperature as for alumina-zirconia grains, it is preferable for the zirconia in the grains of the invention to be entirely in monoclinic form (more than 98%).<br>
Since titanium is a stabilizer for zirconia, it is preferable for its content to be small in the initial charge. Preferably the TiO2 content in the initial charge is thus less than 40%, preferably less than 30%, more preferably less than 25%.<br>
As the examples 10 and 11 show, the presence of magnesia further improves the performances of the grains of the invention. Preferably, the grains of the invention comprise at least 0.1%, preferably at least 0.5% of MgO. The examples 10 and 11 show that a concentration close to 2%, in particular comprised between 1.5 and 2.5%, provides very good results.<br>
In particular, a heat treatment during 10 h at 1100°C, representative of the heat conditions encountered in use, show that the phases, and therefore the properties of the grains, remain steady.<br>
Besides, it is noteworthy that the presence of MgO, according to the invention, avoids the formation of TiO2, which is harmful.<br>
9<br><br>
However, the concentration of MgO is preferably less than 3%, in percentages by weight based on the oxides. Beyond this limit, a part of the magnesia stabilizes the zirconia and the percentage of monoclinic zirconia may be less than 98%.<br>
Examples 10 and 11 are regarded as the most preferable since they give an optimal compromise between the different properties.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the grains of the invention thus present the following concentrations by weight, in percentages by weight based on the oxides:<br>
•	A12O3: more than 16% and/or less than 20%;<br>
•	TiO2: more than 20% and/or less than 24%;<br>
•	MgO: more than 1% and/or less than 3%;<br>
•	ZrO2: more than 55% and/or less than 60%;<br>
Without being restricted to this theoretical explanation, the inventors consider that grains of the invention act in the same way as mullite-zirconia grains to microcrack the composite material, and thus make it better at withstanding thermal shocks.<br>
Unlike zirconia-mullite grains, grains of the invention nevertheless do not lead to a silica-containing environment, which would lead to low resistance to corrosion. Using alumina - titanium oxide - zirconia grains of the invention instead of prior art mullite-zirconia grains thus serves to retain effective resistance to thermal shocks, while improving resistance to corrosion.<br>
Naturally, the implements described are merely examples and they could be modified, in particular by substituting equivalent techniques, without thereby going beyond the ambit of the invention.<br>
