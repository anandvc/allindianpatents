The compounds of the invention exhibit valuable pharmacological properties in mammals including man.<br><br>
Firstly, they are inhibitors of TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TNF-alpha convertase) and thus inhibit TNF-alpha activity, e.g. suppress the production and/or release of TNF alpha, an important mediator of inflammation and tissue growth. Such properties render the compounds of the invention primarily useful for the treatment of tumors (malignant and non-malignant neoplasms) as well as of inflammatory conditions in mammals, e.g. for the treatment of arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis), septic shock, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and the like.<br>
Further, the compounds of the invention also inhibit matrix degrading metalloproteinase enzymes such as gelatinase, stromelysin, collagenase, and macrophage metalloelastase. Thus the compounds of the invention inhibit matrix degradation and are also useful for the treatment of gelatinase-, stromelysin-, collagenase- and macrophage metalloelastase-dependent pathological conditions in mammals. Such conditions include tumors (by inhibiting tumor growth, tumor metastasis, tumor progression or invasion and/or tumor angiogenesis), such tumors being e.g. breast, lung, bladder, colon, ovarian and skin cancer. Other conditions to be treated with the compounds of the invention include osteoarthritis, bronchial disorders (such as asthma by inhibiting the degradation of elastin), atherosclerotic conditions (by e.g. inhibiting rupture of atherosclerotic plaques), as well as acute coronary syndrome, heart attacks (cardiac ischemia), strokes (cerebral ischemias), and restenosis after angioplasty.<br>
Further conditions to be treated with the compounds of the invention are inflammatory demyelinating disorders of the nervous system in which myelin destruction or loss is involved (such as multiple sclerosis), optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), diffuse and transitional sclerosis (Schilder's disease) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, also demyelinating peripheral neuropathies such as Landry-Guillain-Barre-Strohl syndrome for motor defects; also tissue ulceration (e.g. epidermal and gastric ulceration), abnormal wound healing, periodontal disease, bone disease (e.g. Paget's disease and osteoporosis).<br>
Ocular applications of the compounds of the invention include the treatment of ocular inflammation, corneal ulcerations, pterygium, keratitis, keratoconus, open angle glaucoma, retinopathies, and also their use in conjunction with refractive surgery (laser or incisional) to minimize adverse effects.<br>
The compounds are particularly useful for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, such<br><br>
as rheumatoid arthritis, and of tumors.<br>
Beneficial effects are evaluated in pharmacological tests generally known in the art, and as illustrated herein.<br>
The above-cited properties are demonstrable in in vitro and in vivo tests, using advantageously mammals, e.g. rats, guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, or isolated organs and tissues, as well as mammalian enzyme preparations. Said compounds can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g. preferably aqueous solutions, and in vivo either enterally or parenterally, advantageously orally, e.g. as a suspension or in aqueous solution. The dosage in vitro may range between about 10"5 molar and 10"10 molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
The inhibition of the production and secretion of TNF-alpha (by inhibition of TNF-oc convertase) can be determined e.g. as described in Nature 370,555, 558 (1994).<br>
The effect on the production of soluble TNF-alpha by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells can be determined as follows:<br>
Tissue culture medium used is RPM 1640 (Gibco cat #11875-036) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin. THP-1 cells (ATCC #202-TIB) at 1 x 10+5 cells/well are added to 100 fil medium or test compound. Cells are pre-incubated with compound for 30 minutes in a 37°C humidified chamber with 5% C02 and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS (Sigma cat #L-4391) for 4 hours. Plates are then centrigued and 100 μl of conditioned medium for TNF analysis is harvested. The amount of TNF-alpha in control and test cultures is determined by ELISA using recombinant TNF-alpha for the standard curve, using TNF ELISA plates (Genzyme) for TNF analysis. Absorbance readings and data calculations are performed on a Molecular Devices plate reader. Results are expressed in IC50's of test compound.<br>
The effect on the plasma concentration of TNF-alpha in the mouse following intravenous injection of endotoxin can be determined as follows:<br>
Female Balb-CbyJ mice are dosed by gavage with test compound in 0.1 ml cornstarch vehicle/10 grams body weight. One to four hours after administration of test compound,<br><br>
0.1 mg/kg Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 0127:B8 (Difco #3880-25-0) in saline is injected i.v. One hour after i.v. injection of LPS, blood is collected for determination of plasma TNF-alpha using mouse TNF-alpha ELISA kit (Genzyme). Eight mice are used per treatment group. Results are expressed as % inhibition of mean TNF-alpha concentration in control mice.<br>
The effect on the synovial fluid concentration of TNF-alpha in an inflamed rat knee can be determined as follows:<br>
Female Lewis rats are dosed by gavage with test compound in 0.1 ml cornstarch vehicle. One to four hours after administration of test compound 0.1 mg Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 0127:B8 (Difco #3880-25-0) is injected into both knees. Two hours after intra-articular LPS injection, knees are lavaged with 0.1 ml saline and 2 lavages from same rat are pooled. TNF-alpha is measured using mouse TNF-alpha ELISA kit (Genzyme) which crossreacts with rat TNF-alpha. Results are expressed as % inhibition of mean TNF-alpha concentration in synovial fluid from saline-injected knees.<br>
Antiinflammatory activity can be determined in standard inflammation and arthritic animal models well-known in the art, e.g. the adjuvant arthritis model in rats and the collagen II induced arthritis model in mice [Mediators of Inflam. i, 273-279 (1992)].<br>
One test to determine the inhibition of stromelysin activity is based on its hydrolysis of Substance P using a modified procedure of Harrison et al (Harrison, R.A., Teahan J., and Stein R., A semicontinuous, high performance chromatography based assay for stromelysin, Anal. Biochem. 180, 110-113 (1989)). In this assay, Substance P is hydrolyzed by recombinant human stromelysin to generate a fragment, Substance P 7-11, which can be quantitated by HPLC. In a typical assay, a 10 mM stock solution of a compound to be tested is diluted in the assay buffer to 50 |iM, mixed 1:1 with 8 μg recombinant human stromelysin (mol. wt. 45-47 kDa, 2 Units; where 1 Unit produces 20 mmoles of Substance P 7-11 in 30 minutes) and incubated along with 0.5mM Substance P in a final volume of 0.125 ml for 30 minutes at 37°C. The reaction is stopped by adding 10 mM EDTA and Substance P 7-11 is quantified on RP-8 HPLC. The IC50 for inhibition of stromelysin activity and Ki are calculated from control reaction without the inhibitor.<br>
Stromelysin activity can also be determined using human aggrecan as a substrate. This assay allows the confirmation in-vitro that a compound can inhibit the action of<br><br>
stromelysin on its highly negatively-charged natural substrate, aggrecan (large aggregating prtoeoglycan). Within the cartilage, proteoglycan exists as an aggregate bound to hyaluronate. Human proteoglycan aggregated to hyaluronate is used as an enzyme substrate. The assay is set up in 96-well microtiter plates allowing rapid evaluation of compounds. The assay has three major steps:<br>
1)	Plates are coated with hyaluronate (human umbilical chord, 400 ug/ml), blocked with BSA (5 mg/ml), and then proteoglycan (human articular cartilage Dl - chondroitinase ABC digested, 2 mg/ml) is bound to the hyaluronate. Plates are washed between each step.<br>
2)	Buffers + inhibitor (1 to 5,000 nM) + recombinant human stromelysin (1-3 Units/well) are added to wells. The plates are sealed with tape and incubated overnight at 37°C. The plates are then washed.<br>
3)	A primary (3B3) antibody (mouse IgM, 1:10,000) is used to detect remaining fragments. A secondary antibody, peroxididase-linked anti-IgM, is bound to the primary antibody. OPD is then added as a substrate for the peroxidase and the reaction is stopped with sulfuric acid. The IC50 for inhibition of stromelysin activity is graphically derived and Ki is calculated.<br>
Collagenase activity is determined as follows: ninety six-well, flat-bottom microtiter plates are first coated with bovine type I collagen (35 ug/well) over a two-day period at 30°C using a humidified and then dry atmosphere; plates are rinsed, air dried for 3-4 hours, sealed with Saran wrap and stored in a refrigerator. Human recombinant fibroblast collagenase and a test compound (or buffer) are added to wells (total volume = 0.1 ml) and plates are incubated for 2 hours at 35°C under humidified conditions; the amount of collagenase used per well is that causing approximately 80% of maximal digestion of collagen. The incubation media are removed from the wells, which are then rinsed with buffer, followed by water. Coomasie blue stain is added to the wells for 25 minutes, removed, and wells are again rinsed with water. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (20% in 50% dimethylformamide in water) is added to solubilize the remaining stained collagen and the optical density at 570 nM wave length is measured. The decrease in optical density due to collagenase (from that of collagen without enzyme) is compared to the decrease in optical density due to the enzyme in the presence of test compound, and percent inhibition of enzyme activity is calculated. IC50's are determined from a range of concentrations of<br><br>
inhibitors (4-5 concentrations, each tested in triplicate), and Ki values are calculated.<br>
The effect of compounds of the invention in-vivo can be determined in rabbits. Typically, four rabbits are dosed orally with a compound up to four hours before being injected intra-articularly in both knees (N=8) with 40 Units of recombinant human stromelysin dissolved in 20 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.15 M NaCl at pH 7.5. Two hours later the rabbits are sacrificed, synovial lavage is collected, and keratan sulfate (KS) and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (S-GAG) fragments released into the joint are quantitated. Keratan sulfate is measured by an inhibition ELISA using the method of Thonar (Thonar, EJ.-M.A., Lenz, M.E., Klinsworth, G.K., Caterson, B., Pachman, L.M., Glickman, P., Katz, R., Huff, J., Keuttner, K.E. Quantitation of keratan sulfate in blood as a marker of cartilage catabolism, Arthr. Rheum. 28,1367-1376 (1985)). Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are measured by first digesting the synovial lavage with streptomyces hyaluronidase and then measuring DMB dye binding using the method of Goldberg (Goldberg, R.L. and Kolibas, L.

and, if necessary, temporarily protecting any interfering reactive group(s), and then liberating the resulting compound of the invention; and, if required or desired, converting a resulting compound of the invention into another compound of the invention, and/or, if desired, converting a resulting free compound into a salt or a resulting salt into a free compound or into another salt; and/or separating a mixture of isomers or racemates obtained into the single isomers or racemates; and/or, if desired, resolving a racemate into the optical antipodes.<br>
In starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, carboxyl and hydroxy groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino and hydroxy groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side<br><br>
reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxy group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.<br>
Well-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in J.F.W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, New York, 1973, T, W. Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Wiley, New York, 1991.<br>
In the processes cited herein, reactive functional derivatives of carboxylic acids represent, for example, anhydrides especially mixed anhydrides, acid halides, acid azides, lower alkyl esters and activated esters thereof. Mixed anhydrides are preferably such from pivalic acid, or a lower alkyl (ethyl, isobutyl) hemiester of carbonic acid; acid halides are for example chlorides or bromides; activated esters for example succinimido, phthalimido or 4-nitrophenyl esters; lower alkyl esters are for example the methyl or ethyl esters.<br>
Also, a reactive esterified derivative of an alcohol in any of the reactions cited herein represents said alcohol esterified by a strong acid, especially a strong inorganic acid, such as a hydrohalic acid, especially hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydroiodic acid, or sulphuric acid, or by a strong organic acid, especially a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as an aliphatic or aromatic sulfonic acid, for example methanesulfonic acid, 4-methylbenzene-sulfonic acid or 4-bromobenzenesulfonic acid. A said reactive esterified derivative is especially halogen, for example chloro, bromo or iodo, or aliphatically or aromatically substituted sulfonyloxy, for example methanesulfonyloxy, 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy (tosyloxy) or trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy.<br>
The above process for the synthesis of compounds of the invention can be carried out according to methodology generally known in the art for the preparation of hydroxamic acids and derivatives thereof.<br>
The synthesis according to the above process (involving the condensation of a free<br><br>
carboxylic acid of formula IV with an optionally hydroxy protected hydroxylamine derivative of formula V can be carried out in the presence of a condensing agent, e.g. l,r-carbonyldiimidazole, or N-(dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, with or without 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide or dichloromethane, preferably at room temperature.<br>
The synthesis involving the condensation of a reactive functional derivative of an acid of formula IV as defined above, e.g. an acid chloride or mixed anhydride with optionally hydroxy protected hydroxylamine, or a salt thereof, in presence of a base such as triethylamine can be carried out, at a temperature ranging preferably from about -78°C to +75°C, in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene.<br>
Protected forms of hydroxylamine (of formula V) in the above process are those wherein the hydroxy group is protected for example as a t-butyl ether, a benzyl ether, a triphenylmethyl ether, a tetrahydropyranyl ether, or as a trimethylsilyl derivative. Removal of said protecting groups is carried out according to methods well known in the art, e.g. hydrogenolysis or acid hydrolysis. Hydroxylamine is preferably generated in situ from a hydroxylamine salt, such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride.<br>
The starting carboxylic acids of formula IV can be prepared as follows:<br>

wherein R3 and R4 have meaning as defined hereinabove, e.g. with the corresponding sulfonyl chloride, in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine or dicyclohexylamine, using a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or acetonitrile to obtain a compound of the formula VIE<br><br>

Alternatively, the ether intermediates of formula IX can be prepared by reduction of ketone compounds of formula XI<br><br>
wherein R2-R5 have meaning as defined in formula VIII, in the presence of an alcohol of formula X (R1-OH). The reductive O-alkylation can be carried out essentially as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94, 3659 (1972), using mono-, di- or trialkylsilanes or mono-, di- or triarylsilanes in acidic medium, e.g. in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting cis and trans isomers can be separated by known methods, such as chromatography on silica gel.<br><br>
Alternatively, the ketone intermediates of formula XI wherein R2 is hydrogen can be converted to the tertiary alcohol intermediates of formula VIII wherein R2 is lower alkyl (and R2 and ORx' are located on the same carbon atom) according to conventional methods, and such are subsequently etherified with a reactive esterified derivative of R1-OH, such as the trifluoromethanesulfonyl derivative.<br>
The ketones of formula XI can in turn be prepared by oxidation of alcohols of formula VIE by treatment with e.g. sodium hypochlorite in the presence of a free radical, e.g. TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy free radical).<br>

wherein Ar and n have meaning as defined herein, in the presence of an appropriate base, such as potassium carbonate or dicyclohexylamine, in a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide yields an ester of a compound of formula IV. The ester can then be converted to the acid of formula IV, using either hydrogenolysis or standard mild methods of ester hydrolysis, preferably under acidic conditions, the method depending on the nature of the esterifying group.<br>
The above-mentioned reactions are carried out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at low temperatures, room temperature or elevated temperatures (preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used), and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure.

Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g. by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. The hydroxamic acids or carboxylic acid intermediates can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes e.g. by fractional crystallization of d- or l-(alpha-methylbenzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydro-abietylamine, brucine or strychnine)-salts.<br>

Hydrochloric acid gas (from a lecture bottle) is bubbled through for 10 minutes. The reaction is sealed, allowed to slowly warm to room temperature and stirred for 4 days. The solvent is reduced to 1/3 volume by evaporation and triturated with ether. The mixture is filtered, filter cake removed, and dried in vacuo to provide N-hydroxy-2(R)-[(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)(4-picolyl)amino]-2-(trans-4-propoxycyclohexyl)-acetamide hydrochloride as a white solid, m.p. 135-140°C, of the formula<br><br><br>

Example 3:<br>
(a) To a solution of N-(triphenylmethoxy)-2(R)-[(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)(4«picolyl)-amino]-2-(trans-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclohexyl) acetamide (348 mg, 0.48 mmol) in methylene chloride at 0°C containing triethylsilane (260 ΜL, 1.63 mmol) is added trifluoroacetic acid (260 μL, 3.4 mmol) dropwise. After 20 minutes, the reaction mixture is directly concentrated in vacuo and diluted with methylene chloride (4 mL). The resulting solution is cooled to 0°C and acidified with hydrogen chloride gas. The solvent is again removed in vacuo and the residue redissolved with methylene chloride. The solution is triturated by addition of pentane to precipitate out product. The supernatent is removed and the process repeated until all triphenylmethane is removed. The remaining solid precipitate is N-hydroxy-2(RH(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)(4-picolyl)amino]-2-(trans-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)-acetamide hydrochloride, m.p. 133°C.<br><br>
The starting material is prepared as follows:<br>
A solution of (R)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-4-oxocyclohexylglycine benzyl ester (see example 1, 5.0 g, 11.6 mmol), in methylene chloride (35 mL) at room temperature is added to a solution of titanium tetrachloride (1.0 M in methylene chloride) (21.2 mL, 21.2 mmol) and dimethyl zinc (1.0 M in heptane) (23.0 mL, 23.0 mmol) at -78°C in dichloromethane (20 mL). The reaction mixture is stirred at -78°C for 30 minutes, then warmed slowly to room temperature over 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture is poured into water (700 mL) and extracted with chloroform. The combined organic extracts are washed with water, dried (MgS04), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography (40%, ethyl acetate/hexanes) to provide (R)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-trans-4-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexylglycine benzyl ester and (R)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-cis»4-methyl-4-hydroxycyclohexylglycine benzyl ester.<br>
To a solution of (R)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-trans—4-hydroxy-4-methyl-cyclohexylglycine benzyl ester (600.0 mg, 1,34 mmol) in methylene chloride (15 mL) containing 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (755 fil, 3.36 mmol) is added methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (305 μL, 2.68 mmol) dropwise at room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight then quenched with a small amount of methanol. The mixture is diluted with chloroform, then washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and water. The organic layer is dried (MgS04), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography (35% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to provide (R)-N-(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)-trans-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclohexylglycine benzyl ester.<br>
Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ester to the acid and treatment with O-tritylhydroxylamine (instead of Ot-butylhydroxylamine) as in example 1 yields N-(triphenylmethoxy)-2(R)-[(4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)(4-picolyl)amino] 2-(trans-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)acetamide.<br>
(b) Similarly prepared is N-hydroxy-2(R)-[4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl)(4-picolyl)-amino]-2-(cis-4-methoxy-4-methyl-cyclohexyl)-acetamide hydrochloride m.p. 128°C<br>
