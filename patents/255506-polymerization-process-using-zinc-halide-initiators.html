				<td>POLYMERIZATION PROCESS USING ZINC HALIDE INITIATORS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the cationic polymerization of isoolefins and<br>
optionally multiolefins using zinc halide initiators. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to the cationic polymerization of isobutene and isoprene to form butyl rubber<br>
polymers using zinc halide initiators and optionally alkyl halide co-initiators.<br>
Background<br>
Poly(isobutylene-co-isoprene), or MR, is a synthetic elastomer commonly<br>
known as butyl rubber which has been prepared since the 1940's through the<br>
random cationic copolymerization of isobutylene with small amounts of isoprene <br>
2 mole %) . As a result of its molecular structure, IIR possesses superior air<br>
impermeability, a high loss modulus, oxidative stability and extended fatigue<br>
resistance.<br>
Butyl rubber is a copolymer of an isoolefin and one or more, preferably<br>
conjugated, multiolefins as comonomers. Commercial butyl comprises a major<br>
portion of isoolefin and a minor amount, not more than 2.5 mol %, of a conjugated<br>
multiolefin.<br>
Butyl rubber or butyl polymer is generally prepared in a slurry process using<br>
a suitable polymerization solvent, such as methyl chloride, and a Friedel-Crafts<br>
catalyst, such as AICI3, as the polymerization initiator. The methyl chloride offers<br>
the advantage that Aids, a relatively inexpensive Friedel-Crafts catalyst, is soluble<br>
in it, as are the isobutylene and isoprene comonomers. Additionally, the butyl<br>
rubber polymer is insoluble in the methyl chloride and precipitates out of solution as<br>
fine particles. The polymerization is generally carried out at temperatures of about -<br>
90째 C to -100째 C. See U.S. Patent No. 2,356,128 and Ullmanns Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, volume A 23, 1993, pages 288-295. The low polymerization<br>
temperatures are used to achieve molecular weights which are sufficiently high for<br>
rubber applications.<br>
Other compounds that have been found to be active as catalysts for<br>
polymerizing isoolefins include organometallic compounds in combination with a<br>
cation-generating agent, for example CsMesTiMes/B^eFsh (WO-00/04061-A1),<br>
Cp2AIMe/B(C6F5)3 (US-5,703,182), and combinations of zirconocenes and related<br>
complexes with either B(C6F5)3 or CPh3[B(C6F5)4] (WO-95/29940-A1 , DE-A1-198 36<br>
663), Song, X.; Thornton-Pett, M.; Bochmann, M. Organometallics 1998, 17, 1004,<br>
Carr, A. G.; Dawson, D. M.; Bochmann, M. Macromol. Rapid Commun. 1998, <br>
205.<br>
Nuyken, in collaboration with M. Bohnenpoll (Chem. Eur. J. 2004, 10, 6323),<br>
published a system based on [Mn(NCMe)6]2+ salts of non-coordinating borate<br>
anions which was active at room temperature:<br>
YX-<br>
B(C6F5)4, B{C6H3(CF3)2}4<br>
This system operated at +30째C in IB/CH2CI2 but showed no activity  0째C.<br>
Polymerizations were generally slow (55 - 110 h for IB homopolymerizations), and<br>
there was some doubt about the mechanism. IB homopolymers and copolymers<br>
had Mn = 8,000 - 10,000. Conversion was rapidly depressed at higher IP feed.<br>
Zinc compounds have not commonly been used as catalysts for isoalkene<br>
polymerizations. Indeed, ZnCI2 in the presence or absence of alkyl halide activators<br>
(such as MeaCCI or MeCOCI) and used either in neat isobutene or in<br>
isobutene/methyl chloride mixtures, proves to be inactive, and no polymer is<br>
obtained. Recently however, Bochmann and coworkers filed a patent on the use of<br>
Zn(C6P5)2 / Bu'CI system for IB homo- and IB/IP copolymerizations (Canadian<br>
patent application 2,441,079, filed September 16, 2003). Zinc had never been used<br>
as an initiator for cationic polymerizations before. This patent teaches that this<br>
system possessed particularly good copolymerization characteristics and allowed<br>
the formation of IB/IP copolymers in neat IB solutions (no solvent). The polymers<br>
had up to 15 mol-% IP, with little gel content. However, monitoring the reaction of<br>
Zn(C6F5)2 with tert-butyl chloride fBuCI) always found substantial amounts of C6F5H<br>
together with insoluble precipitates. In addition, the Zn(CeF5)2 is expensive to use in<br>
a commercial scale process and lower cost alternatives are therefore being sought.<br>
The need therefore remains for improved polymerization processes using<br>
zinc-based initiators.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the<br>
cationic polymerization of an isoolefin monomer using a zinc-based initiator, the<br>
process comprising: providing a solution of the isoolefin monomer in a halocarbon<br>
solvent; adding a zinc-based initiator comprising an alkyl or aryl zinc halide to the<br>
solution; and, reacting the solution containing the zinc-based initiator to form a<br>
polymer comprising the isoolefin.<br>
Polymerization reactions may be conducted at temperatures high enough to<br>
allow the zinc halide initiator to dissolve in the solution. An alkyl halide activator may<br>
optionally be used and is preferably added to the solution prior to the zinc halide<br>
initiator. Multiolefins may optionally be present with the isoolefin in the solvent and<br>
may participate in the reaction to form co-polymers with the isoolefin. The isoolefin<br>
may comprise isobutene, the multiolefin may comprise isoprene and the polymer<br>
may comprise butyl rubber.<br>
The zinc halide initiators used in the process of the present invention<br>
advantageously exhibit high solubility in the solvent and are low in cost.<br>
Further features of the invention and preferred embodiments thereof will now<br>
be more thoroughly described.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to isoolefin homopolymers and co-polymers of<br>
isoolefins, multiolefins and optionally other co-polymerizable monomers. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the co-polymer is a butyl rubber polymer. The terms "butyl<br>
polymer", "butyl rubber" and "butyl rubber polymer" are used interchangeably<br>
throughout this specification and are intended to mean a polymer prepared by<br>
reacting a major portion of an isoolefin monomer with a minor portion of a multiolefin<br>
monomer.<br>
The process is not limited to a specific isoolefin. However, isoolefins within<br>
the range of from 4 to 16 carbon atoms, in particular 4-8 carbon atoms, such as<br>
isobutene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 4-methyl-1-<br>
pentene and mixtures thereof are preferred. Most preferred is isobutene.<br>
When multiolefins are present in the reaction mixture, the process is not<br>
limited to a specific multiolefin. Every multiolefin copolymerizable with the isoolefins<br>
3<br>
known by the skilled in the art can be used. Multiolefins with in the range of from 4-<br>
14 carbon atoms are preferred. A preferred C4 to Cu multiolefin comprises a C4 to<br>
Cio conjugated diolefin. Some specific non-limiting examples of suitable multiolefins<br>
include isoprene, butadiene, 2-methylbutadiene, 2,4-dimethylbutadiene, piperyline,<br>
3-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, 2,4-hexadiene, 2-neopentylbutadiene, 2-methly-1,5-<br>
hexadiene, 2,5-dimethly-2,4-hexadiene, 2-methyl-1,4-pentadiene, 2-methyl-1,6-<br>
heptadiene, cyclopenta-diene, methylcyclopentadiene, cyclohexadiene, 1-vinylcyclohexadiene<br>
and mixtures thereof. Isoprene is particularly preferably used.<br>
The polymer may be derived from a mixture comprising only the isoolefin<br>
monomer. The polymer may also be derived from a mixture from about 70 to 99.5<br>
parts by weight of the C4 to CQ isoolefin monomer and from about 30 to about 0.5<br>
parts by weight of the C4 to Ci4 multiolefin monomer. More preferably, the polymer<br>
is derived from a mixture comprising from about 80 to about 99.5 parts by weight of<br>
the C4 to Ca isoolefin monomer and from about 20 to about 0.5 parts by weight of<br>
the C4 to Ci4 multiolefin monomer. A most preferred polymer according to the<br>
present invention is derived from a mixture comprising from about 97 to about 99.5<br>
parts by weight of isobutylene and from about 3 to about 0.5 parts by weight of<br>
isoprene.<br>
Those of skill in the art will recognize that it is possible to include an optional<br>
third monomer to produce a butyl terpolymer. For example, it is possible to include<br>
a styrenic monomer in the monomer mixture, preferably in an amount up to about<br>
15 percent by weight of the monomer mixture. The preferred styrenic monomer<br>
may be selected from the group comprising p-methylstyrene, styrene, amethylstyrene,<br>
p-chlorostyrene, p-methoxystyrene, cyclopentadiene,<br>
methylcyclopentadieneindene, indene derivatives and mixtures thereof. The most<br>
preferred styrenic monomer may be selected from the group comprising styrene, pmethylstyrene<br>
and mixtures thereof. Other suitable copolymerizable termonomers<br>
will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Suitable polymerization processes for producing isoolefin-containing<br>
polymers, particularly butyl rubber polymers, are known to persons skilled in the art<br>
and are further described in US 2,356,128. Generally, the processes involve<br>
providing the monomer mixture dissolved in a suitable solvent. The solvents are<br>
generally organic fluids. Organic fluids suitable for use in commercial butyl rubber<br>
polymerization include inert Ci to C4 halogenated hydrocarbons and mixtures<br>
thereof, Cs to Ca aliphatic hydrocarbons, Cs to Cs cyclic hydrocarbons, mixtures of<br>
one or more of the halogenated hydrocarbons and one or more of the aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons, and mixtures of one or more of the halogenated hydrocarbons and<br>
one or more of the cyclic hydrocarbons. Examples of preferred inert organic fluids or<br>
solvents include pentane, hexane, heptane and mixtures thereof with one another<br>
or with halogenated hydrocarbons such as methyl chloride and/or dichloromethane .<br>
Most preferably the organic fluid is a halogenated hydrocarbon selected from the<br>
group consisting of methyl chloride, dichloromethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
A zinc based initiator according to the present invention comprises a divalent<br>
zinc halide Lewis acid that is preferably soluble in either neat IB or in mixtures of IB<br>
and a suitable organic solvent. Although zinc chloride (ZnCI2) is a simple zinc halide<br>
that would be suitable for use as an initiator, it is not soluble in either neat IB or<br>
IB/solvent mixtures. The preferred zinc halides therefore comprise soluble organic<br>
zinc halides, more preferably alkyl or aryl zinc halides, yet more preferably shortchain<br>
alkyl zinc halides. Since the zinc is divalent, there is only one alkyl or aryl<br>
group present in addition to the halide group. The zinc halide preferably does not<br>
comprise an alkoxide. The preferred halogen is chlorine, although bromine may<br>
also be used. Examples of preferred zinc halides include compounds of the<br>
formula:<br>
R-Zn-X (1)<br>
wherein,<br>
R is methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl; and,<br>
X isCI, Br, or I.<br>
It might be advantageous to further add an activator or co-initiator to the<br>
monomer mixture. The invention is not limited to any special co-initiator/activator as<br>
long as the co-initiator compound does not adversely affect the polymerisation<br>
reaction. Preferred are activators of the general formula HX, RX, R3CX or RCOX<br>
with each R independently being a Ci to C5o hydrocarbon radical which may be<br>
linear, branched or cyclic and may contain one or more non-carbon atoms in the<br>
carbon-chain, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl,<br>
octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, cumyl, 3-methylpentyl, 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl and 3,5,5-<br>
trimethylhexyl and each X being a halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Preferred co-initiators are Me3CCI, 'BuCI, cumyl chloride, TMP-2-chloride, MeCOCI,<br>
and Me3CBr. Most preferred are teuCI and cumyl chloride.<br>
The preferred ratio of zinc compound to co-initiator(s) is in the range of from<br>
1:0.1 to 1:10 by mol, and the most preferred ratio is in the range of from 1:1 to <br>
Ethyl zinc chloride (EtZnCI) is a particularly preferred zinc-based initiator that<br>
exhibits good solubility in mixtures of IB with the halocarbon solvent<br>
dichloromethane (CH2CI2), but limited solubility in neat IB. EtZnCI is a Cl-bridged<br>
tetramer. The solid is soluble in organic solvents at room temperature. The system<br>
EtZnCI / Bu'CI shows good activity for IB polymerization and IB/IP<br>
copolymerizations. Because even in this system the in-situ generated ZnCI2 is<br>
insoluble in IB/CHzCfe mixtures at -78째C, the system shows best activities at<br>
temperatures &gt; -35째C. However, the system EtZnCI / cumyl chloride has improved<br>
low temperature solubility and exhibits good polymerization activity at temperatures<br>
of -78째C down to -90 째C or lower. The monomers are therefore preferably<br>
polymerized at temperatures in the range of from -100째C to 40째C, more preferably<br>
in the range of from -90째C to 35째C, yet more preferably in the range of from -80째C<br>
to 35째C, even more preferably in the range of from -70째C to 35째C, still more<br>
preferably in the range of from -60째C to 35째C, yet even more preferably in the<br>
range of from -50째C to 35째C, yet still more preferably in the range of from -35째C to<br>
20 35째C and at pressures in the range from 0.1 to 4 bar.<br>
The use of a continuous reactor as opposed to a batch reactor may have a<br>
positive effect on the process. Preferably, the process is conducted in at least one<br>
continues reactor having a volume of between 0.1 m3 and 100 m3, more preferable<br>
between 1 m3 and 10 m3.<br>
If polymerization is performed continuously, the process is preferably<br>
performed with at least the following feed streams:<br>
I) solvent/diluent (preferably dichloromethane) + isoolefin (preferably<br>
isobutene) + multiolefin (if present, preferably a diene, such as<br>
isoprene); and,<br>
II) zinc halide compound (preferably ethyl zinc chloride)<br>
The alkyl halide activator (if present) can be either pre-dissolved in the<br>
solvent or added to the solvent in conjunction with or following addition of the<br>
monomers. The alkyl halide activator is preferrably provided prior to addition of the<br>
zinc halide initiator.<br>
The zinc halide initiator system may be used to produce either IB<br>
homopolymers of co-polymers of IB and a diene monomer. When the diene<br>
monomer is isoprene, the co-polymer of IB and IP is butyl rubber. The IB<br>
homopolymer has a molecular weight (Mn) in the range of from 25,000 to 500,000<br>
and the IB/IP co-polymer has a molecular weight in the range of from 15,000 to<br>
500,000.<br>
Polymers comprising residual double bonds resulting from the inventive<br>
process may be the starting material for a halogenation process in order to produce<br>
halo-butyl polymers. Bromination or chlorination can be performed according to the<br>
procedures described in Rubber Technology, 3rd Ed., Edited by Maurice Morton,<br>
Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 297 - 300 and references cited within this reference.<br>
The copolymers presented in this invention are ideally suitable for the<br>
production of moldings of all kinds, in particular tire components and industrial<br>
rubber articles, such as bungs, damping elements, profiles, films, coatings. The<br>
polymers are used to this end in pure form or as a mixture with other rubbers, such<br>
as NR, BR, HNBR, NBR, SBR, EPDM or fluororubbers. The preparation of these<br>
compounds is known to those skilled in the art. In most cases carbon black is<br>
added as filler and a sulfur based curing system is used. Peroxide based curing<br>
systems may also be used, particularly when the polymer contains at least 4 mol%<br>
of repeating units derived from at least one multiolefin monomer. For compounding<br>
and vulcanization, reference is made to Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and<br>
Engineering, Vol. 4, S. 66 et seq. (Compounding) and Vol. 17, S. 666 et seq.<br>
(Vulcanization). The vulcanization of the compounds is usually effected at<br>
temperatures in the range of 100 to 200째C, preferred 130 to 180째C (optionally under<br>
pressure in the range of 10 to 200 bar).<br>
The following Examples are provided to illustrate the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: EtZnCI system for IB homopolvmerizations<br>
IB (9 ml) was condensed into a graduated vessel at -78 째C. Pre-chilled<br>
dichloromethane was injected to complete a 22 ml total reaction volume. A 'BuCI<br>
stock solution in dichloromethane (100 ^mol/ ml_ CH2CI2) was prepared at -78 째C.<br>
An aliquot with the appropriate amount of 'BuCI was added to the reactor, followed<br>
by the addition of solid EtZnCI. At this temperature the white solid did not change.<br>
However, when the mixture was allowed to warm to -35째C (checked with internal<br>
thermocouple) the solid dissolved completely. EtZnCI was used in an excess, and<br>
'BuCI was used to control the polymerization rate as the limiting reagent. Reactions<br>
were quenched in methanol, dried at 60 째C until constant weight. Results are<br>
reported in Tables 1-4.<br>
The system was sealed and was warmed to the set temperature indicated in<br>
the tables. For reactions at 20째C the internal pressure has been calculated to be 2<br>
bar. The solution became very cloudy after one minute (the time required for the<br>
mixture to reach the critical temperature of -35 째C where reaction starts). Cooling<br>
again to -78째C gave only traces of polymer (run 637). This shows that the zinc<br>
species involved in the polymerization are insoluble at -78 째C. However, if the<br>
system is sealed in order to avoid IB evaporation, very high conversions are<br>
reached at room temperature (run 639). Polymers thus prepared showed Mn values<br>
of 25 - 47 x 103. High concentrations of 'BuCI (Run 654-655) were used to give<br>
nearly quantitative conversions after a 30 minute reaction. A decrease of<br>
temperature increases the molecular weights of the polymers. A molecular weight of(Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
