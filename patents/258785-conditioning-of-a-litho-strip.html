Conditioning of a litho strip<br>
The invention relates to a method of conditioning the<br>
surface of a work piece, particularly of a strip or sheet,<br>
more particularly of a lithostrip or lithosheet,<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy.<br>
Work pieces such as strips or sheets consisting of an<br>
aluminium alloy are often surface treated after finishing<br>
rolling to prepare them for the next manufacturing step.<br>
In particular strips or sheet for lithographic printing<br>
are conditioned to achieve a predetermined surface<br>
roughness in a subsequent graining process. Lithostrips or<br>
sheets are usually degreased after finishing rolling. As<br>
known from the US-patent specification US 5,997,721,<br>
degreasing respectively cleaning of the surface is done in<br>
one step by anodising the aluminium alloy sheet with AC<br>
current in an acidic electrolyte bath. Another way to<br>
degrease or clean aluminium slivers is known from the<br>
German patent DE 43 17 815 Cl namely the use of an<br>
alkaline medium.<br>
However, prior electro-chemical graining of the<br>
lithostrips they are usually subjected to sodium hydroxide<br>
in a pre-treatment to degrease and clean the surface<br>
again. This step takes place in principle at the side of<br>
the manufacture of lithographic printing plates. Due to<br>
the increasing manufacturing speed during electro-chemical<br>
graining of the lithostrips time for pre-treatment of the<br>
surface of the lithostrips and for the electro-chemical<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
2<br>
graining itself decreases. It has been found that due to<br>
the increasing manufacturing speed the pre-treatment with<br>
sodium hydroxide is not sufficient enough to remove all<br>
contaminants from the surface of the lithostrip. As a<br>
consequence, the results in electro-chemically graining<br>
are not stable and surface defects occur on electro-<br>
chemically grained lithostrips or sheets. However, a<br>
reduction of the manufacturing speed causes higher<br>
production costs for lithographic printing plates.<br>
Hence, it is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
method for conditioning the surface of a work piece and a<br>
work piece consisting of an aluminium alloy enabling an<br>
increasing manufacturing speed in electro-chemical<br>
graining and maintaining at the same time a high quality<br>
of the electro-chemical grained surface of the work piece.<br>
According to a first teaching of the present invention the<br>
above mentioned object is solved by a method of<br>
conditioning the surface of an aluminium work piece<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy, which method comprises<br>
at least the two steps degreasing the surface of the work<br>
piece with a degreasing medium and subsequently cleaning<br>
the surface of the work piece by pickling.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that a combination of the<br>
inventive two step conditioning method with the usually<br>
effected pre-treatment with sodium hydroxide prior<br>
electro-chemical graining of the lithostrips leads to<br>
stable results in the electro-chemical graining even if<br>
manufacturing speeds are increased. The inventive<br>
conditioning method provides surfaces of an aluminium work<br>
piece which are almost free of subsurface oxide particles<br>
introduced by rolling without anodising the surface of the<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
3<br>
aluminium work piece as known from the prior art. As a<br>
result, the surface of the aluminium alloy work piece<br>
conditioned with the inventive method is fully grained<br>
during electro-chemical graining at charge densities which<br>
arc distinctly lower than needed in electro-chemical<br>
graining after conventional cleaning, i.e. the charge<br>
density is less than 900 C/dm2.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention it is<br>
preferred to use an alkaline or an acid medium or an<br>
organic solvent as degreasing medium to degrease the<br>
surface of the work piece. An organic solvent such as<br>
isopropyl-alcohol degreases the surface of the aluminium<br>
work piece effectively whereas alkaline or acid degreasing<br>
media has the additional advantage that the surface of the<br>
aluminium work piece is sensitised for the following<br>
pickling step.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the inventive<br>
conditioning method a further improvement with respect to<br>
removal of rolling oil is achieved if the degreasing<br>
medium contains at least 1,5 to 3 % by weight of a<br>
composite of 5 - 40 % sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
3 - 10 % sodium gluconate, 30 - 70 % soda and 3 - 8 % of a<br>
composite of non-ionic and anionic surfactants. The<br>
described degreasing medium removes rolling oil and other<br>
contaminants from the surface of the conditioned aluminium<br>
work piece with a high effectiveness. Preferably, the<br>
degreasing effect of the degreasing medium can be enhanced<br>
if the temperature of the degreasing medium increases.<br>
Preferably, sodium hydroxide is utilised for pickling.<br>
Using sodium hydroxide in pickling leads to a good removal<br>
of oxide islands on the surface of the aluminium work<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
4<br>
piece is achieved, in particular at elevated temperatures,<br>
i.e. equal or more than 7 0 °C. However, even at lower<br>
temperatures sodium hydroxide supports a stable electro-<br>
chemical graining process with increased manufacturing<br>
speed. Furthermore, hydrofluoric acid can be used as well<br>
for pickling.<br>
According to a further advantages embodiment of the<br>
inventive method pickling comprises AC-cleaning with<br>
phosphoric acid. During AC-cleaning an alternating current<br>
supports pickling process and phosphoric acid is used as<br>
electrolyte. Phosphoric acid attacks in particular the<br>
oxide islands on the surface of the aluminium work piece<br>
which are introduced during rolling. The aluminium of the<br>
surface of the lithostrip is not attacked very strongly.<br>
Using AC-cleaning with phosphoric acid after the<br>
degreasing step of the inventive method a good removal of<br>
oxide islands and contaminants from the surface of the<br>
aluminium work piece is achieved. However, AC-cleaning is<br>
also possible using as electrolyte sulphuric acid.<br>
More preferably, according to a further embodiment of the<br>
invention phosphoric acid is utilised for pickling.<br>
Phosphoric acid, even in absence of an AC current, has the<br>
advantage that it attacks mainly the oxide islands on the<br>
surface of the aluminium work piece and leads merely to a<br>
removal of small amount of the aluminium of the work piece<br>
itself. As a consequence pickling can be accomplished very<br>
thoroughly without removing to much aluminium from the<br>
surface of the work piece. Surprisingly, it has been found<br>
that the results achieved by pickling only with phosphoric<br>
acid are superior compared to the pickling with phosphoric<br>
acid supported by AC current. It is presumed that the<br>
absence of any oxide film, which is build during AC-<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
5<br>
cleaning, is the reason for the superior results of<br>
phosphoric acid in combination with the degreasing step.<br>
Preferably, the work piece is a strip or a sheet, in<br>
particular a lithostrip or a lithosheet. In this case the<br>
necessary electro-chemical graining process for<br>
manufacturing lithostrips or lithosheets can be<br>
accomplished thoroughly within less time and the<br>
manufacturing speed can be increased. Furthermore, the<br>
charge density needed can be reduced while providing a<br>
fully grained strip or sheet surface.<br>
More preferably, the inventive conditioning method is<br>
accompli shed subsequent the manufacturing of a strip, in<br>
particular a lithostrip, and the conditioned strip is<br>
reeled on a coil. In this case a coil of a conditioned<br>
lithostrip can be provided comprising an optimum<br>
performance in further elcectro-chemical graining<br>
processes used to manufacture lithographic printing<br>
plates.<br>
According to a second teaching of the present invention<br>
the above mentioned object is solved by a work piece<br>
consisting of an aluminium alloy conditioned by the<br>
inventive method. As outlined before, the inventive work<br>
piece provides a cleaned surface with an optimum<br>
performance for a subsequent electro-chemical graining<br>
process.<br>
More preferably, the work piece is a strip or a sheet, in<br>
particular a lithostrip or a lithosheet. Lithostrip or<br>
sheets are produced for lithographic printing plates and<br>
differ from ,,,normal" sheets due to the aluminium alloy<br>
they consist of and their specific thickness, which is<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
6<br>
typically less than 1 mm. Furthermore, the surface of<br>
lithostr.i.ps and sheets has to be prepared for a roughening<br>
process, since  manufacturing of lithographic printing<br>
plates generally comprises an electro-chemical graining<br>
process to prepare the surface of the lithographic<br>
printing plates for the printing process. With the<br>
inventive sheets or strips, in particular with the<br>
inventive lithosheets or lithostrips, the necessary<br>
electro-chemical graining of the surface can be<br>
accomplished in shorter time with a reduced charge carrier<br>
density.<br>
Beside an optimised surface of the inventive work piece<br>
the mechanical features and an improved graining structure<br>
during electro-chemical graining can be provided if the<br>
aluminium alloy of the work piece is one of the aluminium<br>
alloys AA1050, AA1100, AA3103 or AlMg0,5. These aluminium<br>
alloys provide the mechanical strength needed for<br>
lithographic printing plates while enabling due to the low<br>
amount of alloying constituents a homogeneous graining of<br>
the surface. However, work pieces consisting of other<br>
aluminium alloys may provide the same advantages.<br>
According to a more preferably embodiment of the inventive<br>
work piece the aluminium alloy contains the following<br>
alloying constituents in percent by weight:<br>
Si 
0,3 % ≤ Fe 
Cu 
Mn 
Mg 
Zn 
 <br>

7<br>
Ti  
impurities each less than 0,005 % in sum max.<br>
0,15 %,rest Al.<br>
The inventive aluminium alloy has state of the art<br>
mechanical and graining properties, in particular when the<br>
lithostrip consisting of said aluminium alloy is<br>
conditioned with the inventive method.<br>
The inventive method of conditioning the surface of an<br>
aluminium work piece as well as the inventive work piece<br>
can be designed and developed further in many different<br>
ways. In this respect, it is referred to the dependent<br>
claims of the independent claims 1 and 8 as well as to the<br>
description of embodiments of the present invention in<br>
connections with the drawings. The drawings shows in Fig.<br>
la) to 1c) pictures of a transmission electron microscope<br>
(SEM) of the surface of an aluminium alloy work piece<br>
conditioned with methods according to three different<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
In the present embodiments of the inventions the work<br>
piece consist of a cold rolled AlMg0,5 aluminium alloy.<br>
However, it has been found that the results achieved with<br>
a AlMg0,5 aluminium alloy are representative for the other<br>
aluminium alloys mentioned in the claims, too. On the left<br>
side Fig. la) to lc) show SEM pictures of a degreased<br>
surface of the work piece, whereby degreasing has been<br>
accomplished by a medium containing at least 1,5 - 3 % by<br>
weight of a composite of 5 - 40 % sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
3 - 10 % sodium gluconate, 30 - 70 % soda and 3 - 8 % of a<br>
composite of non-ionic and anionic surfactants. The dark<br>
areas are identified as rolled-in subsurface oxide<br>
islands. These oxide islands are typically not removed<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
8<br>
during degreasing. However, it has been found that the<br>
capability of the pre-treatments prior to the electro-<br>
chemical graining to remove subsurface oxide islands is<br>
very important to improve the results of electro-chemical<br>
graining, since the oxide islands prevent the respective<br>
surface area from being grained. In Fig. la) on the right<br>
side the work piece surface of the left picture of Fig.<br>
la) is shown after a treatment with sodium hydroxide with<br>
a concentration of 50 g/1 for 1.0 s and at a temperature of<br>
80°C according to a first embodiment of the inventive<br>
conditioning method.<br>
On the one hand pickling with sodium hydroxide at the<br>
elevated temperature has removed almost completely the<br>
oxide island which indicates the interaction between the<br>
two conditioning steps of degreasing and pickling. On the<br>
other hand the pitted structure indicates that pickling<br>
already attacks the bulk material of the work piece<br>
surface. However, this pitted structure may be avoided by<br>
reducing the temperature or the time of pickling with<br>
sodium hydroxide.<br>
Fig. 1b) shows on the right a SEM picture of the surface<br>
of the Inventive work piece conditioned with an AC-<br>
cleaning in an phosphoric acid electrolyte. The AC-<br>
cleaning is accomplished in the present embodiment of the<br>
invention with a current density of 10 A/dm2 with a<br>
concentration of phosphoric acid of 20 % at a temperature<br>
of 80 °C for 10 s. Comparing left SEM picture after<br>
degreasing and the right SEM picture after degreasing and<br>
pickling with AC-cleaning in phosphoric acid it can be<br>
derived that small parts of the black coloured oxide<br>
island has been left on the work piece surface. However, a<br>
pitted structure which indicates that the bulk material<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
9<br>
has been attacked, has not been observed with AC-cleaning<br>
in phosphoric acid in this embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 1c) presents the surface of the inventive aluminium<br>
work piece conditioned with phosphoric acid as second<br>
step. In comparison with the degreased work piece surface,<br>
pickling with phosphoric acid shows that the oxide islands<br>
are attacked mainly and removed from the work piece<br>
surface without leaving a pitted structure as shown after<br>
a conditioning with sodium hydroxide. The pickling with<br>
phosphoric acid shows the best results with respect to<br>
removing of subsurface, rolled-in oxide islands. The<br>
parameters regarding concentration, temperature and<br>
application time are variable and depend on each other.<br>
Hence, similar results may be achievable with different<br>
parameters.<br>
Anyhow, the inventive two-step method of conditioning the<br>
surface of aluminium work pieces provides almost complete<br>
removal of rolled-in subsurface oxide islands enabling a<br>
reduction of the charge entry during electro-chemical<br>
graining to achieved a fully grained surface. Since fully<br>
grained surfaces are particularly desired in manufacturing<br>
lithosheets and lithostrips an advantageous pre-treatment<br>
prior electro-chemical graining is presented with the<br>
inventive conditioning method.<br>
To investigate the ability of the inventive two-step<br>
conditioning of the aluminium work piece to be applied in<br>
a mass production further test with different<br>
concentrations, temperatures has been done. As a result,<br>
for phosphoric acid with concentrations from 20 % to 50%,<br>
at temperatures more or equal than 70 °C an application<br><br>
WO 2006/122852	PCT/EP2006/061358<br>
10<br>
time of 0,1s to 10s shows good results with respect to a<br>
removal of subsurface oxide islands on the aluminium<br>
workpiece. Hence, the inventive two step conditioning<br>
method of the surface of aluminium work pieces can be<br>
applied even in a mass production of conditioned aluminium<br>
work pieces.<br><br>
