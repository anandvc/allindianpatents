LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention provi0des lenses incorporating both birefringent material and zones of more<br>
than one optical power, or focal length.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As an individual ages, the eye is less able to accommodate, or bend the<br>
natural lens, to focus on objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
condition is known as presbyopia. Similarly, for persons who have had their natural<br>
lens removed and an intraocular lens inserted as a replacement, the ability to<br>
accommodate is totally absent.<br>
Among the methods used to correct for the eye's failure to accommodate are<br>
lenses that have more than one optical power. In particular, contact and intraocular<br>
lenses have been developed in which zones of distance and near power are provided.<br>
These lenses are disadvantageous because they are difficult to manufacture.<br>
Additionally, the use of both distance and near power results in some loss of image<br>
contrast at each distance producing a less than completely clear image.<br>
Another known method is to use diffractive simultaneous vision bifocal<br>
lenses which incorporate both diffractive optical elements and refractive elements.<br>
These lenses are disadvantageous in that light is lost to higher order diffraction.<br>
Additionally, the remaining light is split between distance and near vision resulting<br>
in less than clear images. Further, these lenses are extremely difficult to<br>
manufacture.<br>
Yet another known method is to use birefringent material or a material with<br>
two refractive indices. However, the known birefringent lenses are disadvantageous<br>
in use in that the image seen through the lens is not entirely clear.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a multifocal lens that overcomes some or all of<br>
the disadvantages of the prior art lenses.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides a multifocal lens, and methods for producing the<br>
lens, in which concentric, annular zones of differing power are used in combination<br>
with a birefringent material. The lenses of the invention provide a multifocal lens<br>
capable of providing clear vision at both near and far distances.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a lens comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, and consisting of at least two concentric, annular zones of alternating<br>
refractive power and a birefringent material.<br>
By "lens" is meant a contact, an intraocular lens, a comeal implant lens, an<br>
onlay lens, and the like, spectacle lens or combinations thereof. Preferably, the<br>
lenses of the invention are contact lenses.<br>
The birefringent material may form the lens itself. Alternatively, the<br>
concave or convex surface of the lens may be formed from a birefringent material<br>
and the remainder of the lens formed from an isotropic material. As yet another<br>
alternative, and preferably, a birefringent material may be embedded within a non-<br>
birefringent lens material or an isotropic material. By "embedded" is meant that the<br>
birefringent material is substantially encased within the lens material. Suitable<br>
birefringent materials for lens production are known and include, without limitation,<br>
organic<br>
polymers and polymers in which birefringence is induced by application of stress or<br>
stretching.<br>
In embodiments in which an isotropic material is used in combination with a<br>
birefringent material, the isotropic materials may be any material useful for forming<br>
ophthalmic lenses. Preferably, the materials used are suitable for forming hard or,<br>
more preferably, soft contact lenses. Suitable soft contact lens materials include,<br>
without limitation, silicone elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including,<br>
without limitation, those disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,371,147,<br>
5,314,960, and 5,057,578 incorporated herein in their entireties by reference,<br>
hydrogels, silicone-containing hydrogels, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
More preferably, the surface of the contact lens is a siloxane, or contains a siloxane<br>
functionality, including, without limitation, polydimethyl siloxane macromers.<br>
In the lenses in which the birefringent material is embedded within the lens,<br>
preferably, the birefringent material is embedded so that h is substantially wholly<br>
within the optic zone of the lens. Additionally, the birefringent material preferably<br>
is embedded within the bulk of the lens material to ensure wearer comfort. The<br>
embedded birefringent material may be introduced into the non-birefringent or<br>
isotropic lens material by any convenient method. For example, the birefringent<br>
material may be first formed and then surrounded by lens material by inserting it<br>
into a contact lens mold half into which lens material is then dispensed, introducing<br>
the other mold half, and curing the mold assembly. As another example, lens<br>
material may be dispensed into a mold half and partially cured followed by inserting<br>
the birefringent material onto the partially cured lens material, dispensing additional<br>
lens material, introducing the second mold half, and curing the mold assembly.<br>
In the lenses of the invention, at least two, concentric annular zones are<br>
provided. In the case of a contact lens, the annular zones will be within the lens'<br>
optic zone. One of the annular zones is of a refractive power substantially equal to<br>
the distance optical power, or power required to correct the lens wearer's distance<br>
vision acuity. The distance optical power zone alternates with a zone of refractive<br>
power substantially equal to that of the near optical power, or power required to<br>
correct the lens wearer's near vision acuity.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a pair of lenses is provided in which the<br>
central portion of the optic zone of each lens provides optical power substantially<br>
equal to the distance optical power. Annular zones or alternating distance and near<br>
optical power surround this central zone. Annular rings of alternating near and<br>
distance optical power surround this central optical zone. Alternatively, one lens<br>
may be as above-described, the other lens having a central zone with power<br>
substantially equal to the near optical power and surrounded with alternating near<br>
and distance optical power annular zones.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a pjir of ophthalmic<br>
lenses, one lens to be worn in the dominant eye and one to be worn in the non-<br>
dominant eye. By "dominant eye" is meant the eye that predominates for distance<br>
vision. The lens worn by the dominant eye has a surface, preferably the convex<br>
surface, with a central optic zone with substantially the desired distance optical<br>
power, and a surface, preferably the concave surface, that has at least two concentric<br>
annular zones in its optic zone. The power of each of the at least two annular zones<br>
is substantially equal to that of the distance optical power. Either or both the convex<br>
and concave surfaces may have additional annular zones with distance optical<br>
power, near optical power, or combinations thereof. Preferably, one surface, more<br>
preferably the convex surface, has only the central optical zone and no annular<br>
zones, the opposite surface, preferably the concave surface, in this embodiment<br>
having at least two annular zones of alternating distance and near optical power.<br>
Most preferably, the convex surface has only a central optical zone having the<br>
distance optical power, the concave surface having at least two zones of alternating<br>
distance and near optical powers.<br>
Further in this embodiment, the lens worn by the non-dominant eye has a<br>
surface, preferably the convex surface, with a central optic zone with substantially<br>
the desired near optical power. The opposite surface, preferably the concave surface,<br>
has at least two concentric annular zones in its optic zone. The power of each of the<br>
at least two annular zones is substantially equal to that of the near optical power.<br>
Either or both the convex and concave surfaces have additional annular zones with<br>
distance optical power alternating with those having near optical power.<br>
For the various contact lens embodiments, typically, the lens will be<br>
constructed with one or both non-optical lenticular and peripheral zones. The ratio<br>
of the contact lenses' optic zone to be devoted to distance and near optical power<br>
may be determined as disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,929,969, 5,835,192,<br>
5,715,031, 5,682,223, 5,485,228, and 5,448,312, incorporated herein in their<br>
entireties by reference.<br>
In all embodiments of the lenses of the invention, the distance and near<br>
optical powers may be aspherical or spherical powers, but preferably are spherical.<br>
The lenses may have any of a number of a variety of corrective optical<br>
characteristics incorporated onto the surfaces in addition to distance and near optical<br>
powers, such as, for example, cylinder power.<br>
The annular zone of the lenses of the invention may be formed by any<br>
conventional method. For example, contact lenses with the annular zones formed<br>
therein may be produced by diamond-turning using alternating radii. The zones may<br>
be diamond-turned into the molds that are used to form the lens of the invention.<br>
Subsequently, a suitable liquid resin is placed between the molds followed by<br>
compression and curing of the resin to form the lenses of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the zones may be diamond-turned into lens buttons. Similarly,<br>
spectacle lenses may formed using molds with the zones formed therein. Additional<br>
methods for forming lenses are within the ordinary skill of the art of lens<br>
manufacture.<br>
