200710129604.6, filed on July 23, 2007 and entitled "Vector Coding/Decoding Method and<br>
Apparatus and Stream Media Player", which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to codec technologies and in particular to a vector<br>
coding/decoding method and apparatus and a stream media player.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Vector quantization technologies are usually deployed in stream media coding, a<br>
common one of the technologies is lattice vector quantization which is quite widely used in<br>
low-rate scenarios. In audio coding, for example, the quantization technology deployed in<br>
Transform Code Excite (TCX) part of the widely used Extend Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband<br>
codec (AMR-WB+) audio coding algorithm is a multi-rate lattice vector quantization<br>
technique built on REg.<br>
In the TCX part of the AMR-WB+ audio coding algorithm, the multi-rate lattice<br>
vector quantization approach is applied as the quantization approach. The multi-rate lattice<br>
vector quantization approach is applied on preshaped spectral data by groups each consisted of<br>
eight values, and quantizes the eight values as elements in the REg set based on a principle of<br>
proximity. In the algorithm, a set of elements is selected from the RE8 with the quantization,<br>
which	is	defined	as	RE8 =2DgO{2D8 +(1,...,1)}	,	where<br>
D8 = {( x1, x2, ..., x8) Є Z8 | x1 + • • • + x8 is even}. Therefore, the sum of all elements in<br>
the RE8 set is a multiple of 4. Thus, the quantization approach includes searching the 2D8 set<br>
for an element closest to the original data, searching the 2D8+(1,1,1,...,1) set for an element<br>
closest to the original data, and comparing the two elements searched out to obtain a result, i.e.<br>
an initial vector, which is a group of integer data (x0,x1 ,... , xn-1) denoted by ck. Because<br>
the inputted data is divided into groups each consisted of eight values, the resulting ck is<br>
actually (x0,x1,...,x7) .<br>
Subsequently, basic codebooks of Q0, Q2, Q3, Q4 are searched for the ck. If no ck is<br>
found in the basic codebooks, the basic codebooks are extended with the ck through Voronoi<br>
extension, so that a corresponding basic codebook index and an extended codebook index are<br>
determined. The basic codebooks of Q0, Q2, Q3, Q4 are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br><br>
Characteristic codebooks shown in Table 1, i.e. leaders, are distributed on the<br>
respective spheres. The Sphere indicates the size of a sphere, the Size indicates a number of<br>
the codewords derived from permutation and combination of the leader, and the Ka identifies<br>
the respective leaders, with each leader being identified by a different Ka value. The value of<br>
Sphere(S) is a quarter of the sum of all components of the leader each to the power of four, i.e.<br><br><br>
Each leader corresponds to an S having a different value. In the<br>
coding, each value of S corresponds to a value of ka. In the case of an 8-dimensional vector, a<br>
corresponding ka can be searched out with only the calculated value of S of the 8-dimensional<br>
vector, and thus a leader to which the value of S belongs may be determined from the value of<br>
ka. The basic codebooks of the leaders are further shown in Table 1. The basic codebooks are<br>
divided into Q0, Q2, Q3 and Q4. The Qo contains only one leader, and the Q2, Q3, and Q4<br>
contain 3, 8 and 28 leaders respectively, where as shown in Table 1.<br>
After the basic codebook to which the ck belongs is determined, assuming that the<br>
ck is a sample from a set of elements (a0, a1,..., aq-1 ,) and w(i) is the number of element<br>
ai in the sample, thus the number of possible states of Leader L is k(l) given as follows:<br><br><br>
Then (x0,x1,...,xn_l) is derived from d(k) based on that d(k) = i and<br>
xk=ai .<br>
The above solution is disadvantageous at least in that multiple irregular factorials<br>
are calculated during coding and decoding, furthermore, the calculation of these random<br>
factorials can hardly be simplified by lookup process, resulting in high calculation complexity.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The present invention is described in details below illustratively with reference to<br>
the drawings for better understanding of objects, solutions and advantages of the present<br>
invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the vector coding method according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes the following steps. It shall be noted that stream media in the<br>
description refer to multimedia applying streaming technologies, such as video and audio. For<br>
the sake of description, only audio is described in the description, and processes on other<br>
stream media such as video are similar to those on audio.<br>
Step 101. An initial vector is decomposed to obtain a sign vector and an initial<br>
absolute vector.<br>
A sign of an element in the initial vector may be positive or negative, and there are<br>
numerous possible combinations of the positive and negative signs. Therefore, by<br>
decomposing the initial vector to obtain the sign vector, the number of combinations of<br>
elements in the initial vector may be reduced, thereby reducing subsequent amount of<br>
calculation.<br>
Step 102. A sign code is obtained by coding the sign vector.<br>
A sign of each of all the elements may be picked up directly. Alternatively, signs of<br>
only non-zero elements may be picked up after a sign of any zero element is removed, and thus<br>
data bits to be occupied by integer value of the sign vector is reduced.<br>
The integer value of the sign vector may be obtained using a scheme provided in an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In the scheme, a sign of any element in the initial vector<br>
having a value of zero is removed from the sign vector, the signs of the non-zero elements are<br>
arranged in an order in which the non-zero elements are arranged in the initial vector, and thus<br>
a sign code is obtained, with "1" representing a positive sign and "0" representing a negative<br>
sign, or "0" representing the positive sign and "1" representing the negative sign, so that the<br>
sign code corresponding to the sign vector of the initial vector is obtained and the number of<br>
bits of the sign code equals to the number of the non-zero elements in the initial vector. As<br>
described above, while "1" and "0" are used in the case of binary, other values may be used in<br>
the case of, for example, octal, decimal, etc. The arrangement order in the description is<br>
described as from left to right. However in practice, the arrangement order may be from right<br>
to left or from middle to right and left, and processes are similar to those in the case of the<br><br>
arrangement order from left to right and description thereof are omitted herein.<br>
Furthermore in practice, a post-process is required for the sign code, because a<br>
constraint exists in designing a basic codebook for a quantization process, in other words, a<br>
sum of values of all elements in a vector needs to be a multiple of 4. If a variance of the sum of<br>
values of all elements due to a change on a sign of any individual element is a multiple of 4,<br>
the signs of the individual elements are independent; otherwise, the signs of the individual<br>
elements are dependent, which means that correlation and redundancy between the signs exists,<br>
and the redundancy between the signs needs to be eliminated for the purpose of efficient<br>
coding. Because any dependent sign of the initial vector may be determined by other sign bits,<br>
a simple approach of eliminating redundancy is not to code the sign of the last non-zero<br>
element of the initial vector among the dependent signs, i.e. to remove the last bit of the<br>
obtained sign code, so as to satisfy the condition that a sum of values of all elements in a<br>
vector needs to be a multiple of 4. The sign of the remaining one element may be derived<br>
directly from known signs of other elements of the vector.<br>
Step 103. Multi-level permutation-based coding is performed on the initial absolute<br>
vector to obtain an absolute vector code.<br>
The multi-level permutation-based coding is to remove level by level an element of<br>
the initial absolute vector which satisfies a preset condition, for example, an element<br>
corresponding to the most frequent element value. If two or more most frequent element<br>
values are present, elements corresponding to which may be removed in order of their values.<br>
Of course, the elements may also be selected and removed using other means depending on<br>
specific application environment. In practice, all elements corresponding to two or more most<br>
frequent element values may be removed.<br>
In multi-level permutation-based coding, for elements remaining at the current<br>
level, data on their positions at an upper level constitutes a position permutation, a possible<br>
value of the position permutation is the number of elements belonging to the upper level, and<br>
the obtained position permutation at the current level is coded. In this way, the multi-level<br>
permutation-based coding is performed on the absolute vector until an element at the<br>
decomposition level corresponds to only one element value, as a result, a series of level-based<br>
coded values are obtained and the absolute vector code is obtained by combining the<br>
level-based coded values. In practice, in the multi-level permutation-based coding, the<br>
level-based coded values may be combined level by level, or combined at a time after all the<br>
level-based coded values are obtained. In the description of the present invention hereinafter,<br>
the way that the level-based coded values are combined level by level is taken as an example<br>
for illustration.<br>
Step 104. The sign code and the absolute vector code are combined to obtain a code<br><br>
of the initial vector.<br>
The code of the initial vector may be obtained by combining the sign code and the<br>
absolute vector code, so that in decoding, the absolute vector and the sign vector of elements<br>
of the absolute vector can be decoded from the code of the initial vector. A specific<br>
combination process includes: after determining the number of bits of the sign code,<br>
combining the absolute vector code shifted left by the number and the sign code, thereby<br>
obtaining the code of the initial vector.<br>
In practice, it is also possible to combine the absolute vector code shifted right and<br>
the sign code. Alternatively, it is possible to combine the sign code shifted left or right and the<br>
absolute vector code after the number of bits of the absolute vector code is determined. The<br>
present invention is not limited to a particular approach of combining the absolute vector code<br>
and the sign code, and all approaches of deriving a sign code and an absolute vector code from<br>
a code of an initial vector in decoding are intended to fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
As can be seen from the above description that no calculation using complex<br>
formula is performed to code absolute vector with multi-level permutation-based coding<br>
approach in embodiments of the present invention, so that calculation complexity is reduced.<br>
In practice, multiple characteristic codebooks may be present, in other words, at<br>
least two characteristic codebooks exist in the codebook space. In this case, after a coded value<br>
of the initial vector, which belongs to a characteristic codebook, is obtained, it is required to<br>
proceed with:<br>
obtaining a characteristic value of the characteristic codebook to which the initial<br>
vector belongs in the codebook space, combining the characteristic value and the code of the<br>
initial vector which belongs to the characteristic codebook, and obtaining a resulting code of<br>
the initial vector.<br>
Characteristic values of the individual characteristic codebooks in the codebook<br>
space are different, and the characteristic value may be an entirely shifted value of the<br>
characteristic codebook in the codebook space, or other value which may uniquely identify the<br>
characteristic codebook in the codebook space, such as a serial number of the characteristic<br>
codebook. Accordingly, by combining the code of the initial vector which belongs to the<br>
characteristic codebook and the characteristic value, the code is mapped to characteristic<br>
codebook, so that the corresponding codebook may be used for decoding. The specific<br>
procedure of the combination is same as that of combining an integer value of a sign vector<br>
and a code of an initial vector. In practice, when an entirely shifted value of a characteristic<br>
codebook in the codebook space is used as the characteristic value, due to an interval between<br>
entirely shifted values of the respective characteristic codebooks in the codebook space, a final<br><br>
coded value may be obtained by adding the code of the initial vector which belongs to the<br>
characteristic codebook and the entirely shifted value if the interval is sufficiently large.<br>
After the above steps, an initial vector may be mapped to a corresponding<br>
characteristic codebook in the case of multiple characteristic codebooks.<br>
When the method according to the embodiment of the present invention is<br>
deployed in a transform-domain lattice vector quantization coding in a speech audio standard,<br>
due to that all basic codebooks for the lattice vector quantization coding are constant, element<br>
types of each Leader and the number of elements of each type are determined, and an order of<br>
multi-level permutation-based coding, configuration parameters, etc., may be determined in<br>
advance according to the Leader. In the case of the codebook of the basic codebooks shown in<br>
Table 1, for example, the order of multi-level permutation-based coding and the configuration<br>
parameters according to an embodiment of the present invention are shown in Table 2, where<br>
an element corresponding to the most frequent element value is removed level by level.<br><br><br><br>
Table 2 shows a decomposition order corresponding to each Leader, i.e. element<br>
values removed level by level, as shown in the column of decomposition order. Each element<br>
in the Leader is removed level by level based on a value of the element in accordance with<br>
data in the column of decomposition order from left to right. Data of m 1, m2 and m3 in the last<br>
column denote respectively values of numbers (m) of elements for permutation-based coding<br>
at levels 1, 2 and 3, m at an upper level equals to a value of a number (n) of elements at the<br>
current level, and a value of n of the permutation-based coding at the first level is a dimension<br>
of the lattice vector (for example, n is 8 for REg). Data Vc in the last column denotes the<br>
number of element types in the terms of an absolute value in the Leader, i.e. the number of<br>
levels of the multi-level permutation-based coding. Data Sn in the last column denotes the<br>
number of bits of a sign code.<br>
The vector coding method according to an embodiment of the present invention is<br>
described below in a specific embodiment. As shown in Figure 2, calculated data at each stage<br>
of the vector coding belonging to Leader 20 is described.<br>
By decomposing elements in vector of (0, -2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0) belonging to Leader<br>
20, an absolute vector of (0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0) and a sign vector of (0, -1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) are<br>
obtained.<br>
After 0s are removed from the sign vector, a binary sign code of 100 is obtained<br>
with "1" representing the negative sign and "0" representing the positive sign. The binary 100<br>
is a decimal 4, thus the sign code Sign=4.<br>
With reference to Table 2, to perform multi-level permutation-based coding on the<br>
absolute vector, elements having a value of 0 in the absolute vector are removed to obtain an<br>
absolute vector of (2, 4, 6). For the elements of 2, 4 and 6, data on their positions at an upper<br>
level are 1,4 and 6 respectively. In this case, three elements are selected from eight elements<br>
in accordance with a combination principle, and a corresponding position code may be<br>
calculated with a preset formula, i.e. index83 = <br>
where p0 denotes the position data of "2", p1 denotes the position data of "4", and p2 denotes<br>
the position data of "6". Alternatively, the position code may be searched out from a preset<br><br>
position code table, an example of which in an embodiment of the present invention is shown<br>
in Figure 3 a. The position code corresponding to the respective position data of 1,4 and 6 is 31,<br>
as can be seen from Figure 3a.<br>
Subsequently, the multi-level permutation-based coding is proceeded with on the<br>
obtained absolute vector which has three elements. Because the three elements correspond to<br>
three different element values, one element is removed from the three elements in order. With<br>
reference to Table 2, an element having a value of 2 is removed, obtaining an absolute vector<br>
of (4, 6) having two elements. Because the position code at the upper level is 31, a combined<br>
position code of 31*3+2=95 is obtained by combining the position code at the current level<br>
and the position code at the upper level. The reason for timing 3 is that the number of<br>
combinations obtained from selecting two elements from three elements is 3, and the reason<br>
for adding 2 is that the data of positions in the vector of (2, 4, 6) for the elements of 4 and 6<br>
from the obtained absolute vector of (4, 6) is 1 and 2 and a position code of 2 is obtained in<br>
accordance with a formula of index32= where p0 denotes the<br>
position data of the element of "4", and p1 denotes the position data of the element of "6". Of<br>
course, the position code may be also searched out from a preset position code table, an<br>
example of which in an embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 3b. The<br>
position code corresponding to the respective position data of 1 and 2 is 2, as can be seen from<br>
Figure 3b.<br>
Likewise, the multi-level permutation-based coding is proceeded with on the<br>
obtained absolute vector which has two elements. With reference to Table 2, an element<br>
having a value of 4 is removed, obtaining an absolute vector of (6) having only one element.<br>
The position code at the upper level is 95, the number of combinations obtained from selecting<br>
one element from two elements is 2, and the data on position in the vector of (4, 6) for the<br>
element of 6 is 1, therefore a position code of 1 is obtained in accordance with a formula of<br>
index21 = where p0 denotes the data on position in the vector of (4, 6) for the<br>
element of "6". As a result, the combined position code is 95*2+1=191.<br>
At this point, the multi-level permutation-based coding is completed because the<br>
number of element value in the obtained absolute vector is 1. Because the number of non-zero<br>
elements among initial elements in the absolute vector is 3, in other words, the number of bits<br>
of the integer value of the sign vector is 3, in order to combine the sign code and the absolute<br>
vector code, the absolute vector code is shifted left by 3 bits and added to the sign code, so that<br><br>
the absolute vector code and the sign code are combined and stored, and a coded value of the<br>
initial vector which belongs to Leader 20 is obtained as 191*(23)+4=191*8+4=1532, where 4<br>
is the sign code. Subsequently, the code belonging to Leader 20 and the entirely shifted value<br>
of Leader 20 in the codebook space are combined, and the obtained final coded value is 59260<br>
given that the entirely shifted value of Leader 20 in the codebook space is 57728. The entirely<br>
shifted value of Leader 20 in the codebook space is dependent upon the storage position of<br>
Leader 20 in a system, and may vary from system to system, but is constant in a system.<br>
As can be seen from the above description that no complex factorial is calculated<br>
and amount of calculation is low. Furthermore, it is required to store only a table shown as<br>
Table 2, formulas for calculating a position code or a position code table used in searching for<br>
a position code, and a little of temporal data in an embodiment, therefore not much storage<br>
space is occupied. In the embodiment, any element corresponding to one element value are<br>
removed at each level; however in practice with many element values, elements corresponding<br>
to multiple element values may be removed at each level.<br>
The method according to the third embodiment of the present invention is shown in<br>
Figure 4, and the method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 401. A sign vector and an absolute vector are obtained by decomposing an<br>
initial vector.<br>
Step 402. The signs of non-zero elements are arranged in an order in which the<br>
non-zero elements are arranged in the initial vector, and thus a sign code is obtained, with "1"<br>
representing the positive sign and "0" representing the negative sign.<br>
In practice, the sign code may be obtained with "0" representing the positive sign<br>
and "1" representing the negative sign, or otherwise.<br>
Step 403. It is determined whether the signs of the elements in the initial vector are<br>
independent. If the signs are independent, the method proceeds to Step 405, otherwise the<br>
method proceeds to Step 404.<br>
Step 404. The last bit of the sign code is removed.<br>
Step 405. Any element which corresponds to the element value corresponding to<br>
the most elements is removed form the absolute vector.<br>
In the embodiment, an approach that any element which corresponds to the<br>
element value corresponding to the most elements is removed from the absolute vector is<br><br>
deployed. However in practice, an approach that any element which corresponds to the<br>
element value corresponding to the least elements is removed from the absolute vector may be<br>
deployed.<br>
Step 406. For elements which correspond to element values not corresponding to<br>
the most elements, their data on the positions in the absolute vector is obtained, and a position<br>
code is obtained by a preset approach.<br>
The preset approach may be that the position code is calculated using a formula for<br>
calculating a position code or searched out in a preset position code table.<br>
Step 407. It is determined whether the number of element values not corresponding<br>
to the most elements is 1; and if the number is 1, the process proceeds to Step 409; otherwise,<br>
the process proceeds to Step 408.<br>
Step 408. Elements corresponding to element values not corresponding to the most<br>
elements are retained in order, to construct a new absolute vector, and the process proceeds to<br>
Step 405.<br>
Step 409. The obtained position codes are combined into a combined position code,<br>
which is shifted left by the number of bits of the sign code and combined with the sign code, to<br>
obtain a code of the initial vector which belongs to the characteristic codebook determined<br>
from the initial vector.<br>
Step 410. The code belonging to the characteristic codebook and the entirely<br>
shifted value of the characteristic codebook in the codebook space are combined, to obtain a<br>
final coded value of the initial vector.<br>
The multi-level permutation-based coding is deployed in the embodiment, no<br>
complex factorial is calculated and amount of calculation is low. Furthermore, not much<br>
temporal data is required to be stored in the embodiment, and therefore not much storage space<br>
is occupied.<br>
A vector decoding method corresponding to the vector coding method is provided<br>
in an embodiment of the present invention. After receiving the resulting code of an initial<br>
vector, a decoding side decomposes a value to be decoded in accordance with an approach<br>
opposite to the coding, obtains permutation-based decoding values of the respective parts,<br>
obtains position information by decoding, and multi-level replacement is performed, to obtain<br>
the resulting initial vector. The decoding includes: (1) searching the range of the coded value<br><br>
to obtain a Leader to which the lattice vector belongs, thereby obtaining a shift value of the<br>
code, and subtracting the shift value from the coded value to obtain a coded value in the<br>
Leader; (2) decomposing the coded value in the Leader, to obtain a value of sign code and a<br>
value of multi-level permutation-based code; (3) decomposing level by level the value of<br>
multi-level permutation-based code to obtain values of permutation-based code at each level,<br>
obtaining position vectors at each level through parse using a permutation-based decoding<br>
module, and restoring element values at all positions in the initial vector using multi-level<br>
replacement approach.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the vector decoding method according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes:<br>
Step 501. A vector code is decomposed, to obtain a sign code and an absolute<br>
vector code.<br>
A characteristic codebook corresponding to the vector may be obtained from the<br>
vector code, and the number of bits of the sign code corresponding to the vector code may be<br>
searched out from a preset decoding table.<br>
The sign code indicates signs of elements in the initial vector. The number of<br>
elements in each characteristic codebook is known, therefore the number of bits of the sign<br>
code is determined from the determined characteristic codebook, and all of these may be<br>
stored in the preset decoding table.<br>
Data on bits of a sign code is extracted from the vector code, to obtain the sign code.<br>
Due to that the vector code is constructed by the absolute vector code and the sign code jointly,<br>
if the coded value of the characteristic codebook is obtained from combining the absolute<br>
vector code shifted left and the sign code in coding, the several most right bits of the vector<br>
code is the sign code<br>
To obtain the absolute vector code, the vector code from which the data on the bits<br>
of the sign code has been extracted is shifted right by the number of bits of the sign code. After<br>
the sign code is extracted, the data from which the sign code has been extracted is shifted right<br>
by the number of bits, thereby obtaining the absolute vector code, which is inverse to the<br>
procedure of coding.<br>
Step 502. The sign code is decoded to obtain a sign vector.<br>
The obtained integer value of sign vector is converted as binary. The signs of<br><br>
elements are determined dependent upon whether "0" represents the positive sign and "1"<br>
represents the negative sign or "0" represents the negative sign and "1" represents the positive<br>
sign in coding. In this embodiment, the sign code is described as being determined from the<br>
signs of non-zero elements.<br>
Step 503. Multi-level permutation-based decoding is performed on the absolute<br>
vector code, to obtain an initial absolute vector.<br>
A specific procedure of the multi-level permutation-based decoding includes the<br>
following.<br>
The absolute vector value is decomposed, to obtain position codes of elements<br>
from the absolute vector at the upper-level absolute vector. Actually, the absolute vector code<br>
is consisted of position codes obtained in the multi-level permutation-based coding, thus the<br>
position codes related the respective levels may be obtained by decomposing directly the<br>
absolute vector code in decoding.<br>
The position codes are decoded, thereby obtaining data on positions at the<br>
upper-level absolute vector for elements from the absolute vector.<br>
The number of elements of the absolute vector at the upper level, and any element<br>
value of elements removed for obtaining the absolute vector are searched out from the preset<br>
decoding table.<br>
The elements of the absolute vector are arranged in the absolute vector at the upper<br>
level in accordance with the data on position, and the element value of the removed elements<br>
is provided at the remaining position, so that the absolute vector at the upper level is obtained.<br>
If the absolute vector at the upper level is not the initial absolute vector, the method<br>
proceeds with the multi-level permutation-based decoding in accordance with the steps above,<br>
until the initial absolute vector is obtained.<br>
Step 504. The sign vector and the initial absolute vector are combined, thereby<br>
obtaining an initial vector.<br>
Particularly, the signs are provided in order for the non-zero elements in the initial<br>
absolute vector.<br>
It is possible that the last bit of the sign code is removed in coding due to the<br>
dependency of the signs of elements, therefore in reconstructing the initial vector, if the most<br>
right non-zero element of the initial vector is provided with no element sign, an element sign<br><br>
of the most right non-zero element may be determined in accordance with the principle that<br>
the sum of values of all elements in the initial vector is a multiple of 4. Of course, it is also<br>
possible that the most left non-zero element of the initial vector is provided with no element<br>
sign, depending on the non-zero element of which the sign is removed in coding.<br>
As can be seen from this embodiment, no irregular factorial is calculated and<br>
amount of calculation is low in decoding using the solution according to the embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, the temporal data is similar with that for coding, and therefore not much storage<br>
space is occupied.<br>
In practice, if the obtained code is a final code combined with a characteristic value<br>
of the characteristic codebook in the codebook space, the final code is required to be<br>
decomposed with the following steps:<br>
determining a characteristic codebook corresponding to the initial vector from the final<br>
code of the initial vector, thereby obtaining a characteristic value of the characteristic<br>
codebook in the codebook space; and<br>
determining a vector code of the initial vector which belongs to the characteristic<br>
codebook from the final code and the characteristic value.<br>
The characteristic value may be an entirely shifted value. Due to that a storage<br>
position of each characteristic codebook in the codebook space is fixed, the entirely shifted<br>
value of the characteristic codebook in the codebook space is fixed, and the characteristic<br>
codebook where the coded value is may be determined from the range where the coded value<br>
is after the code is obtained. Particularly, a table, in which each characteristic codebook and its<br>
shift value are recorded, may be stored in a system. The table may be searched for decoding.<br>
Likewise, a similar process is performed for the case where the characteristic value is a serial<br>
number of the characteristic codebook.<br>
Particularly, if the code is obtained by adding a code of the vector which belongs to<br>
the characteristic codebook and the entirely shifted value in coding, the coded value belonging<br>
to the characteristic codebook may be obtained by subtracting the entirely shifted value from<br>
the code.<br>
With the above steps, the code of the vector which belongs to the characteristic<br>
codebook may be obtained by decomposing the final code, thereby decomposing the coded<br>
value of the vector which belongs to the characteristic codebook to obtain the initial vector.<br>
The vector decoding method according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown in Figure 6, and includes the following.<br><br>
Step 61. A Leader and an Offset are obtained from the range where the final coded<br>
value is.<br>
Given the coded value of 59260, it may be determined that the coded value belongs<br>
to Leader 20, and the Offset is 57728.<br>
Step 62. A coded value of the initial vector which belongs to the Leader may be<br>
obtained by subtracting the Offset from the final coded value.<br>
A coded value of 1532 which belongs to Leader 20 is obtained by subtracting<br>
57728 from 59260.<br>
Step 63. A sign code and an absolute vector code are obtained by decomposing the<br>
coded value of the initial vector which belongs to the Leader.<br>
A sign code of 4 and an absolute vector code of 1528 are obtained by decomposing<br>
1532.<br>
Step 64. Element signs of elements in the absolute vector are restored from the sign<br>
code.<br>
A decimal 4 is converted to a binary 100 given that" 1" represents the negative sign<br>
and "0" represents the positive sign in coding, therefore element signs corresponding to the<br>
non-zero elements indicate respectively "-", "+" and "+" from left to right.<br>
Step 65. Multi-level permutation-based decoding is performed, which includes:<br>
Step 651. A level-n code of the absolute vector code is decomposed.<br>
The n indicates the number of levels of the multi-level permutation-based coding<br>
used in coding. The value of n may vary with different characteristic codebook, and may be<br>
obtained directly from item Vc in Table 2.<br>
This embodiment is described taking Leader 20 as an example. As can be seen<br>
from Table 2, there are 4 levels, any element having an element value of 0 is removed at level<br>
1, any element having an element value of 2 is removed at level 2, and any element having an<br>
element value of 4 is removed at level 3, as a result, the level 4 has an element having a value<br>
of 6. It will be noted that sign bits of the absolute vector code are shifted right by 3 bits<br>
(corresponding to the shift by 3 bits in coding) before decomposition, and obtains 191 from<br>
1528/(23)=1528/8.<br>
Step 652. The level-3 code of the absolute vector code is decomposed.<br>
For example, in the case of Leader 20, there are 4 levels, but decomposition will<br>
not be carried out at the level 4, and only 3 levels of permutation-based coding are carried out<br>
for Leader 20, accordingly, the decoding starts with the level 3. Because any element<br>
corresponding to one element value is removed at each level during the coding, any element<br><br>
corresponding to one element value is restored correspondingly at each level during decoding.<br>
As can be seen from Table 2 that m3 is 1, m2 is 2 and ml is 3, the number of combinations<br>
obtained from selecting elements the number of which is the number of elements at level 2<br>
from elements the number of which is the number of elements at level 3, i.e. 1 out of 2, is 2.<br>
Therefore, according to a calculation of 191%2, the obtained quotient is 95, which is a<br>
permutation-based position code for levels 1 and 2, the remainder is 1, which is a position<br>
code of an element from the absolute vector at level 3 at the absolute vector at level 2, and<br>
position data corresponding to the position code is 1.<br>
Step 653. The level-2 code of the absolute vector code is decomposed.<br>
Similarly, according to a calculation of 95%3, the obtained position code for level<br>
1 is 31, the remainder is 2, which is a position code of an element from the absolute vector at<br>
level 2 at the absolute vector at level 1, and position data corresponding to the position code is<br>
1 and 2.<br>
Step 654. The level-1 code of the absolute vector code is decomposed.<br>
Because the level 1 is the last level, a position code of an element from the level-1<br>
absolute vector at the initial vector is obtained. Further, ml is 3 and the number of bits of the<br>
initial data is 8, thus position data of 1,4 and 6 which corresponds to the position code of 31 is<br>
searched out from the table shown in Figure 3a. It will be appreciated that the position data<br>
may be also calculated with a formula.<br>
Step 655. Data at the position to be determined at the level 1 is replaced with a<br>
decoded result at the level 2.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the element value removed first is 0, thus 0 is set at positions<br>
in the absolute vector other than positions 1, 4 and 6.<br>
Step 656. Data at the position to be determined at the level 2 is replaced with a<br>
decoded result at the level 3.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the element value removed secondly is 2, and positions 4 and<br>
6 among the positions 1, 4 and 6 in the absolute vector is retained at the lower level, thus the<br>
element value of 2 is provided at the position 1.<br>
Accordingly, the element value of 4 is provided at the position 4 and the element<br>
value of 6 is provided at the position 6, thereby obtaining the initial absolute vector of (0,2, 0,<br>
0,4, 0, 6, 0).<br>
No step for levels 4 to n is carried out because decoding for 3 levels only is<br>
required for Leader 20. In practice, for a certain Leader corresponding to many levels, process<br>
for each level is similar, and description thereof is omitted herein.<br><br>
Step 657. Data at the position to be determined at the level n-1 is replaced with a<br>
decoded result at the level n.<br>
Step 66. Signs of the non-zero elements in the absolute vector are restored from left<br>
to right.<br>
The obtained signs of the non-zero elements are respectively "-", "+" and "+" from<br>
left to right, thus an initial vector of (0, -2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0) is obtained.<br>
Step 67. If the sign of the most right non-zero element in the initial vector has not<br>
been determined, the sign of this non-zero element may be determined according to the<br>
principle that the sum of values of all elements in the initial vector is a multiple of 4.<br>
In practice, it is possible that the sign bit for the most right non-zero element is<br>
removed due to the dependency of the signs of initial vector, therefore in decoding, if the most<br>
right non-zero element of the obtained initial vector is provided with no sign value, the sign of<br>
the most right non-zero element may be determined in accordance with the principle that the<br>
sum of values of all elements in the initial vector is a multiple of 4.<br>
As can be seen in the embodiment, no irregular factorial is calculated and amount<br>
of calculation is low in decoding using the solution according to the embodiment. Furthermore,<br>
the temporal data is similar with that for coding, and therefore not much storage space is<br>
occupied.<br>
A vector coding apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention is<br>
provided, as shown in Figure 7, and the apparatus includes:<br>
a decomposing unit 71, adapted for decomposing an initial vector to obtain a sign vector<br>
and an initial absolute vector;<br>

condition if the number of the element values in the new absolute vector is larger than 1; and<br>

code calculating formula, or search a preset position code table for the position code. In<br>
practice, the multi-level permutation-based coding unit 73 may further include a preset code<br>
table storage unit adapted for storing the preset code table in which the preset condition is<br>
stored, and the element removing unit searches the preset code table for any element to be<br>
removed; and<br>

unit adapted for determining the number of bits of a sign code; and a combining unit adapted<br>
for shifting left the absolute vector code by the number of bits of the sign code and combining<br>
the sign code to obtain the initial vector code.<br>
As can be seen, the absolute vector is coded using an approach of multi-level<br>
permutation-based coding in the embodiment, so that no calculation with complex formulas is<br>
conducted, and computation complexity is lowered.<br>
In practice, if the number of characteristic codebook in a codebook space is at least<br>
two, the code of the initial vector needs to be mapped to the characteristic codebook. To this<br>
end, the vector coding apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention further<br>

obtaining unit adapted for arranging elements from the absolute vector at an absolute vector at<br>
the upper level in accordance with the position data and providing the element value of the<br>
removed element at the remaining position to obtain the absolute vector at the upper level, and<br>

absolute vector at the upper level if the absolute vector at the upper level is not the initial<br>
absolute vector; the position data obtaining unit may calculate the position code with a preset<br>
position data decoding formula, or search a preset position data decoding table for the position<br>
data; and<br>

In practice, if a plurality of characteristic codebooks are involved in the coding, the<br>
