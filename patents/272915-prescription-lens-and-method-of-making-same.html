PRESCRIPTION LENS AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a lens, and more particularly to a<br>
prescription lens and a method of manufacturing same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lenses used in eyeglasses or spectacles for treating myopia, hyperopia,<br>
astigmatism and presbyopia of a wearer, or used in sunglasses or protective eyeglasses<br>
having wrap-around segments designed to shield the eye from incident light, wind and<br>
foreign objects in the temporal vision field of a wearer, have certain optical properties<br>
corresponding to a set of specifications as described in a prescription for the wearer.<br>
These lenses are usually prescribed to have a front curved lens surface designed to<br>
fit a curve profile of frames. As shown in Fig. 9, for a minus lens 900 with a front curved<br>
lens surface 910, the lens edge 920 is thicker than the other area of the lens 900. The<br>
larger the front base curve of a minus lens is, the thicker the lens edge of the minus lens<br>
is. For example, for a lens with a minus prescription of -4.00 sphere, if the lens has a<br>
front base curve of 2.00, the back surface curve of the lens would be of 6.00. If the lens<br>
has a front base curve of 4.00, the back surface curve of the lens would be of 8.00. The<br>
edge thickness of the lens with the front base curve of 4.00 is larger than that of the lens<br>
with the front base curve of 2.00. Traditionally, a patient with a strong minus<br>
prescription needs a lens with a very thick edge. Therefore, traditionally the myopia<br>
patient will use flatter ophthalmic frame base curve to reduce lens thick edge.<br>
The large thickness at the edge of a lens may have a number of disadvantages<br>
such as obscuring wearer's views at wide angles, unappealing appearance, increasing the<br>
lens weight, and so on.<br>
Additionally, conventional prescription lens is almost impossible to match with<br>
sunglass frame since most of sunglass frame use base curve 6 or 8, whereas conventional<br>
minus lens is using base curves between 2 and 4. For instance, for a minus lens of-4.00,<br>
 <br>
its thickness will be extremely thick if the frame base curve is about 6.00 (so as to lens)<br>
and lens back side curve shall be cut at a base curve 10 regardless of solution of<br>
inadequate bevel matching attempt.<br>
Therefore, a heretofore unaddressed need exists in the art to address the<br>
aforementioned deficiencies and inadequacies.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a<br>
prescription lens. In one embodiment, the method includes the step of obtaining<br>
information of a prescription lens and information of a frame to accommodate the<br>
prescription lens, where the information of the prescription lens comprises a lens power,<br>
an optical area and a spherical front base curve, and the information of the frame<br>
comprises a frame curve.<br>
The method further includes the steps of calculating the maximum lens thickness<br>
of the prescription lens at the optical area according to the information of the prescription<br>
lens; selecting a lens according to the calculated maximum lens thickness at the optical<br>
area, the information of the prescription lens and the information of the frame; and<br>
processing the selected lens so as to obtain the prescription lens that has a transition zone<br>
surrounding the optical area and an edge portion surrounding the transition zone such that<br>
the thickness of the edge portion is substantially thinner that the maximum lens thickness<br>
of the optical area. In one embodiment, the frame curve is characterized with an angle<br>
and tilt of the frame. The spherical front base curve of the prescription lens matches the<br>
frame curve of the frame.<br>
The prescription lens has a geometric center and an optical center that is<br>
corresponding to the center of the optical area of the prescription lens. In one<br>
embodiment, the optical center is substantially coincident with the geometric center. In<br>
another embodiment, the optical center is substantially displaced from the geometric<br>
center.<br>
In one embodiment, the prescription lens is a single vision lens. In another<br>
 <br>
embodiment, the prescription lens is a progressive lens. Additionally, the prescription<br>
lens can be a plus lens or a minus lens.<br>
In one embodiment, the selected lens is a finished lens. The processing step is<br>
performed by injection, casting and cutting the edge portion of the finished lens so that<br>
the thickness of the edge portion is substantially constant and thinner that the maximum<br>
lens thickness of the optical area.<br>
In another embodiment, the selected lens is a semi-finished lens. The processing<br>
step is performed by cutting a predetermined area of the semi-finished lens to form the<br>
optical area therein and cutting the edge portion of the semi-finished lens so that the<br>
thickness of the edge portion is constant and substantially thinner that the maximum lens<br>
thickness of the optical area.<br>
The prescription lens is formed of glass or plastic.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a prescription lens manufactured<br>
according to the method disclosed above.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a prescription lens. In one<br>
embodiment, the prescription lens has a spherical front lens surface, a rear lens surface,<br>
and a lens body defined between the spherical front lens surface and the rear lens surface.<br>
The lens body is characterized with an optical area, a transition zone surrounding the<br>
optical area and an edge portion surrounding the transition zone, where the optical area is<br>
adapted for providing a lens power according to a prescription of a lens for a wearer. The<br>
thickness of the edge portion is substantially constant and thinner that the maximum lens<br>
thickness of the optical area. The lens body has a geometric center and an optical center<br>
that is corresponding to the center of the optical area. In one embodiment, the optical<br>
center is substantially coincident with the geometric center. In another embodiment, the<br>
optical center is substantially displaced from the geometric center.<br>
The spherical front lens surface is configured to match the frame curve of a frame.<br>
In one embodiment, the rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body is configured<br>
such that the lens body at the optical area corresponds to a single vision lens. In another<br>
embodiment, the rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body is configured such<br>
 <br>
that the lens body at the optical area corresponds to a progressive lens. In one<br>
embodiment, the rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body is configured such<br>
that the lens body at the optical area corresponds to a plus lens. In one embodiment, the<br>
rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body is configured such that the lens body<br>
at the optical area corresponds to a minus lens.<br>
These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
following description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the<br>
following drawings, although variations and modifications therein may be affected<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.<br>

 <br>
purposes of this invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, this invention, in<br>
one aspect, relates to a prescription lens and a method for manufacturing same.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates schematically lenses 110 and 120 used in a pair of eyeglasses<br>
with the prescription information of the lenses 110 and 120 (a set of specifications) as<br>
described in a prescription for a wearer. The prescription information includes a size of<br>
the lenses 110 and 120 including a height, H, and a width, W, a pupillary distance (PD)<br>
that is the distance (usually measured in millimeters) between the center 114 (124) of the<br>
pupil in an eye and the inner edge of the lens 110 (120), a distance between the lenses<br>
(DBL) that is distance between the inner edges of the lens 110 (120), and optical center<br>
height (OCH). The size of the lenses 110 and 120 is adapted for fitting an eyeglass<br>
frame, and used to select proper lens blanks to produce the lenses 110 and 120. The size<br>
information defines the geometric center 112 (122) of the lens 110 (120). Additionally,<br>
the pupillary distance (PD) defines the optical center 114 (124) of the lens 110 (120).<br>
The prescription information also includes a lens power, a front base curve, sphere<br>
power, cylinder power, axis, distance vision (DV), near vision (NV), and so on, for each<br>
lens 110 or 120.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a prescription minus lens 200 with a top view (a) and a side<br>
view (b) is schematically shown according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The prescription lens 200 has a spherical front lens surface 216, a rear lens surface 218,<br>
and a lens body 210 defined between the spherical front lens surface 216 and the rear lens<br>
surface 218. The lens body 210 is characterized with an optical area 211, a transition<br>
zone 213 surrounding the optical area 211 and an edge portion 215 surrounding the<br>
transition zone 213. The optical area is adapted for providing a lens power according to a<br>
prescription of a lens for a wearer. The thickness Te of the edge portion 215 is<br>
substantially constant and thinner that the maximum lens thickness of the optical area<br>
211. The lens body 210 has a geometric center 212 and an optical center 214 that is<br>
corresponding to the center of the optical area 211. The optical center 214 is<br>
substantially displaced from the geometric center 212. As shown in Fig. 4, the optical<br>
center 414 of a prescription lens 400 is also substantially displaced from the geometric<br>
 <br>
center 412. However, the optica! center 514 of a prescription lens 500 (600, 700) can also<br>
substantially be coincident with the geometric center 512, as shown in Figs. 5 to 7.<br>
The spherical front lens surface 216 is configured to match the frame curve of a<br>
frame. The rear lens surface 218 at the optical area 211 of the lens body 210 is<br>
configured such that the lens body 210 at the optical area 211 corresponds to a single<br>
vision lens. In one embodiment, the rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body<br>
is configured such that the lens body at the optical area corresponds to a progressive lens.<br>
Additionally, rear lens surface 218 at the optical area 211 of the lens body 210 is<br>
configured such that the lens body 210 at the optical area 211 corresponds to a minus<br>
lens. In one embodiment, the rear lens surface at the optical area of the lens body of the<br>
prescription lens 600 (700) is configured such that the lens body at the optical area<br>
corresponds to a plus lens, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.<br>
The prescription lens is formed of a transparent material such as glass or plastic.<br>
The prescription lens 200 can be manufactured by the following steps: at first, the<br>
information of a prescription lens and information of a frame to accommodate the<br>
prescription lens are acquired, where the information of the prescription lens comprises at<br>
least a lens power, an optical area and a spherical front base curve and other information<br>
described above. The information of the frame comprises a frame curve that is<br>
characterized with an angle and tilt of the frame. The spherical front base curve of the<br>
prescription lens is adapted for matching the frame curve of the frame. The frame angle,<br>
which is up to 24 degrees for a wrap around type sunglass, is measured. Additionally, the<br>
pantoscopic tilt of the frame in degrees is also measured or estimated at the time of<br>
performing the lens calculations. The information of the optical center height (OCH) or<br>
the distance above the bottom most portion of the frame is also needed.<br>
Then with a combination of the pupil distance, the frame angle and the lens front<br>
curve selected, the lens angle is determined, which varies with each frame. Once the lens<br>
angle is known, then a compensation for the axis can be made.<br>
The changes in sphere and cylinder power necessary due to the wrap angle are<br>
determined. The angle needed to cylinder, and the changes needed to the sphere and<br>
 <br>
cylinder powers are determined so that the patient experiences the same sphere and<br>
cylinder as prescribed. The pupil distance (PD) is also compensated so that the optical<br>
center is mounted directly in the line of site of the patient. The actual lens surface is<br>
calculated to take all of these calculations into account.<br>
Then, the lens thickness of the prescription lens at the optical area is calculated<br>
according to the information of the prescription lens. The calculating step is performed<br>
lens design software developed by Advanced Lens Technologies, LLC. The software is<br>
specifically designed to manage the patient's prescription and frame information, lens<br>
blank selection which enables the creation of personalized lenses for the customer. In<br>
one embodiment, the lens edge thickness and edge thinness are determined by the<br>
compensated prescription rear surface and resulting thickness of the optical area before<br>
determining the optical zone, transition zone and outer zone.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is to determine the maximum<br>
thickness desired by a combination or individual value based on the prescription. For<br>
example: the maximum lens thickness for a -4.00 sphere with -0.75 cylinder at 80<br>
degrees can be calculated based on the following formula: the maximum lens thickness =<br>
sphere power only, or the maximum lens thickness = (sphere power + cylinder power).<br>
The optical zone can be selected, based on an optical zone diameter or other shape that<br>
are predetermined. This will then be used as the maximum lens thickness at the edge of<br>
the selected optical zone in a minus lens. The lens thickness can be set for sphere +<br>
cylinder = maximum thickness of 5 mm for example. Then, the maximum size of the<br>
optical zone is calculated.<br>
Once the maximum size of the optical zone is known, the transition zone and the<br>
outer zone are then calculated. The transition zone can be either predetermined with a<br>
size of, e.g., 5 mm, or can be varied based on various thickness lenses and desired<br>
cosmetic appearance.<br>
Fig. 8(a) shows a top view of a prescribed minus lens 810 according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, showing how the wrap angle of about 22 degrees is<br>
determined. Fig. 8(b) shows a top view of a traditional minus lens 820, where, as a<br>
 <br>
comparison, the profile of the prescribed minus lens 810 is outlined. It is clearly shown<br>
that the edge thickness of the prescribed minus lens 810 is much thinner that of the<br>
traditional minus lens 820.<br>
Based on the calculated maximum lens thickness at the optical area, the<br>
information of the prescription lens and the information of the frame, a lens blank 201 is<br>
selected, as shown in Fig. 3(a).<br>
The selected lens is then processed to obtain the prescription lens 200 that has a<br>
transition zone 213 surrounding the optical area 211 and an edge portion 215 surrounding<br>
the transition zone 213 such that the thickness Te of the edge portion 215 is substantially<br>
thinner that the maximum lens thickness To of the optical area 211.<br>
The selected lens can be a finished lens or a semi-finished lens. For a finished<br>
lens, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the processing step is performed by injection, casting and<br>
cutting the edge portion 217 of the finished lens so that the thickness of the edge portion<br>
is substantially constant and thinner that the maximum lens thickness of the optical area.<br>
According to the present invention, for a finished lens with blend zone and outer zone,<br>
the backside mold for the finished lens is much different from the traditional back surface<br>
mold for the finished lens. This invention allows for stronger minus and plus powered<br>
lenses to be made with an optical zone, and a blend zone, plus an outer zone. The<br>
traditional injected or cast lens is made with a back mold that is made to include the<br>
prescription powers only with no accommodation for a blend zone or other zones.<br>
For a semi-finished lens, the processing step is performed by cutting a<br>
predetermined area of the semi-finished lens to form the optical area therein and cutting<br>
the edge portion of the semi-finished lens so that the thickness of the edge portion is<br>
constant and substantially thinner that the maximum lens thickness of the optical area.<br>
The process of manufacturing a prescription sunglass lens using a spherical front<br>
lens surface manufactured to offer a best fit for the sunglass frame. This invention is not<br>
limited to sunglass lenses and is intended to cover any prescription lens used with the<br>
matching front base curve and frame curve. This invention acknowledges that a limited<br>
number of prescriptions will use the proper front lens base curve and matching frame<br>
 <br>
curve, however the traditional methods of producing these prescription lenses would not<br>
compensate the prescription of the curvature of the wrap or tilt of the sunglass frame.<br>
This invention covers single vision finished lenses.<br>
This offers cosmetic benefits as well as increased optical correctness. This<br>
invention is a combination of best appearing and fitting of a prescription lens. When<br>
viewed from the front this invention produces a prescription sunglass lens that fits in the<br>
frame like a non-prescription lens. When viewed from the backside the lens is produced<br>
to be thinner than a lens produced using traditional lens production methods currently<br>
used to produce the majority of prescription lenses.<br>
A prescription sunglass lens is currently produced based on the prescription.<br>
Once the prescription is known a front spherical curve lens is recommended. Then the<br>
calculation for making the required prescription is determined. Production of the lens is<br>
then able to begin. The stronger the minus prescription lens is, the flatter the front base<br>
curve of the lens is recommended.<br>
For example, a strong minus prescription of -4.00 sphere would traditionally<br>
recommend a front base curve of 2.00 to 4.00. To produce this for a lens with a base<br>
curve of 2.00 you would have to have a back surface curve of 6.00. With a front curve of<br>
4.00 you would need a back curve of -8.00 to produce a -4.00 prescription. Both of<br>
these example lenses are now cut to fit the frame. Almost all sunglass frames are<br>
designed for a 6 base front curve lens or an 8 base front curve lens, (a few more recent<br>
frame designs require a 9 base front curve lens). To fit an incorrect front curve to a 6 or 8<br>
base curve frame the lens will have a portion the prescription lens that does not fit exactly<br>
to the spherical front surface but rather to a bevel that has been applied to the prescription<br>
lens to allow it to be placed in a frame that the front curve was not designed for.<br>
The solution this invention provides is that a prescription lens can be produced<br>
that will fit the frame curve with an almost perfect fit. To do this, the method of<br>
developing the lens form to produce a prescription that will allow the patient to see<br>
clearly must be calculated to take into account data currently not considered for the<br>
production of a sunglass prescription lens.<br>
 <br>
A limited number of optical professionals producing a prescription lens have<br>
changed the prescriptions to take into account the frame wrap and pantoscopic tilt. This<br>
makes the wearer able to see as if the wearer is looking through traditional prescription<br>
lenses made to fit flat to the face. The difference that this invention offers over the<br>
changes to wrap and tilt is that with this method of making a sunglass lens the lens<br>
prescription is adjusted for proper vision in the as worn position and the front base curve<br>
is matched to the frame.<br>
This invention makes a lens that when viewed from the front, as if looking at the<br>
patient, does not look any different than a non-prescription lens. The optics of the lens is<br>
also modified by this invention to make the prescription work properly with the fit of the<br>
frame and the non-traditional front base curve that is used.<br>
This invention has the ability to produce better fitting and better cosmetic looking<br>
lenses in both plus and minus powers. This benefit is produced by developing a lens that<br>
will work for the patents prescription based on the frame angle and tilt without<br>
considering the patients actual frame shape. The optical area of this lens may not extend<br>
to all parts of the frame. To accomplish producing a lens that the patient can see out of,<br>
and one that fits the frame, we must create area of the lens that make the lens fit and keep<br>
the prescription lens as thin as possible for the area of vision we have chosen to use.<br>
The optical center and the geometric center are not located in the middle of the<br>
lens. The geometric center is the center of the circular lens, while the optical center is<br>
located 4 to 10mm from the geometric center. This allows the lens to cover the frame<br>
and place the optical center in front of the patient's eye.<br>
A significant aspect of this invention is the calculation of the thinnest lens that<br>
will still give the patient an excellent area of the lens that is optically correct for their<br>
prescription. To calculate the optimized lens we first need to know the patient<br>
prescription information. We also need the frame information. A trace of the frame or<br>
other method to acquire the frame shape is needed. Depending on the prescription a<br>
different target lens thickness is developed. As an example: A lens with a -5.00 sphere<br>
with an 8 base curve frame will produce a thick edged lens. Our software will calculate<br>
 <br>
the prescription after it is optimized for lens and frame information including frame angle<br>
and frame tilt. If the desired maximum lens thickness is 4.5 mm then an optical area is<br>
described by the software where the maximum lens thickness is 4.5mm. Any area<br>
outside this thickness that is greater than 4.5 mm would become a non-optically correct<br>
area and only be used to develop additional lens material needed to properly fit the frame<br>
so that the end result is a cosmetic design that has a good usable optical area yet looks<br>
like a non-prescription lens when worn by the patient.<br>
