CATIONIC DYES, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE Cationic dves<br>
The present invention relates to novel cationic dyes, compositions thereof, to processes for their preparation and to their use in the dyeing of organic material, such as keratin fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, especially keratin-containing fibers, cotton or nylon, and preferably hair, more preferably human hair.<br>
It is known, for example, from WO 95/01772, WO 95/15144, EP 714 954 and EP 318 294 that cationic dyes can be used to dye organic material, for example keratin, silk, cellulose or cellulose derivatives, and also synthetic fibers, for example polyamides. Cationic dyes exhibit very brilliant shades. A disadvantage is their unsatisfactory fastness to hydrolysis and to light, their frequently inadequate stability under reducing or oxidizing conditions, and their frequently unsatisfactory storage stability (see: John F. Corbett:"The Chemistry of Hair-Care Products", JSCD August 1976, page 290).<br>
The actual technical problem of the present invention was to provide brilliant dyes that are distinguished by deep dying having good fastness properties with respect to washing, light, shampooing and rubbing, and that preferably exhibit satisfactory stability under reducing or oxidizing dyeing conditions, for the dyeing of organic material.<br><br>
has been discovered,<br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R7 are each independently of the other hydrogen, hydroxyl; unsubstituted or<br>
substituted C1-C6alkyl, aryl radical or C1-C6alkoxy; or -NR3R4,<br>
wherein<br><br>
R3 and R4 are each independently of the other hydrogen, unsubstituted or substituted aryl radical or CrC6alkyl, and<br><br><br>
The alkyl radical is, for example, C1-C8alkyl, C1-C6alkyl and preferably C1-C4alkyl, and may be straight-chain, branched, substituted or unsubstituted, or, from C5alkyl upwards, monocyclic or polycyclic, and may be uninterrupted or interrupted by hetero atoms, such as O, S, N, NH; for example -CH2CH2-O- CH2CH2-O- CH2CH3, or - CH2CH2-<br>
o- CH2CH3l or-CH2CH2-0-CH3, or - CH2-0-CH3.<br>
Ci-C8alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 2,2'-dimethylpropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl or 2-ethylhexyl.<br>

C1-C4alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
C1-C6alkoxy is O-C1-C6alkyl, preferably O-C1-C4alkyl.<br>
Aryl radical is, for example, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, benzyl- or tolyl<br>
Halide is, for example, fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide, especially chloride and fluoride.<br>
"Anion" denotes, for example, an organic or inorganic anion, such as halide, preferably chloride and fluoride, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, phosphate, boron tetrafluoride, carbonate, bicarbonate, oxalate or C1-C8alkyl sulfate, especially methyl sulfate or ethyl sulfate; anion also denotes lactate, formate, acetate, propionate or a complex anion, such as the zinc chloride double salt.<br>
The anion is especially a halide, preferably chloride or fluoride, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate,<br>
methylsulfate, phosphate, formate, acetate or lactate.<br>
The anion is more especially chloride, methyl sulfate, formate or acetate.<br><br>
Most preference is given to cationic dyes of formula (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7)<br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
X" is an anion.<br>
The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of the dyes of formula (1), preferably to a dye of formula (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7) and comprises reacting a compound of formula (8), which is obtainable according to methods known, such as described in T. Deligeorgiev at al in "Dyes and Pigments", Vol. 31(3), pages 219 to 224, from 1996,<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R3 and R4 are each independently of the other hydrogen, C1-C6alkyl, unsubstituted or<br>
substituted aryl radical, preferably R3 and R4 are each independently of the other<br>
hydrogen, CrCealkyl, preferably, wherein R^ is hydrogen; and X" is an anion.<br>
The reaction is generally initiated by bringing the compound of formula (8) and the amine of formula (9) into contact; for example by mixing together the starting compounds or by drop wise addition of one starting compound to the other.<br>
Customary, the temperature is in the range of 290 to 300 K during the mixing of the starting compounds.<br>
The molar ratio of compound of formula (8) to amine of formula (9) is generally selected in the range from 5:1 to 1:5, especially in the range from 3:1 to 1:3, more especially in the range from 2:1 to 1:1.<br>
The duration of reaction is generally dependent on the reactivity of the starting compounds, on the reaction temperature chosen and on the desired conversion. The chosen duration of reaction is usually in the range from one hour to three days.<br>
The reaction temperature for the reaction of the compound of formula (8) with the amine of formula (9) is advisable to select in the range from 293 to 363K, especially in the range from 323 to 355K, more especially in the range from 333 to 355K.<br>
The reaction pressure chosen is generally in the range from 70 kPa to 10 MPa, especially from 90 kPa to 5 MPa, and is more especially atmospheric pressure.<br>
It may by desirable to conduct the reaction of compound of formula (8) and amine of formula (9) in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The molar ratio of compound of formula (8) to the catalyst is generally selected in the range from 10:1 to 1:5, especially in the range from 10:1 to 1:1.<br><br>
Suitable catalysts are for example an alkali metal C1-C6alkyloxide, such as sodium-, potassium or lithium Ci-C6alkyloxide, preferably sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide or lithium methoxide, or sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide or lithium ethoxide; or tertiary amines, for example, such as pyridine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, trioctyllamine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan, chinuclidine, N-methylpiperidine; or alkalimetal acetate, for example such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, or lithium acetate. Preferred are potassium acetate, sodium methoxide, pyridine and 1,4-diaza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octan.<br>
It is recommended that the reaction mixture obtained be subsequently stirred in the selected temperature range from 293 to 363 K, especially in the range from 323 to 355K, more especially in the range from 333 to 355K. The duration chosen for the subsequent stirring is generally from 1 hour to 24 hours.<br>
In addition, the reaction can be carried out with or without solvent, but is preferably carried out in a solvent. Preference is given to organic solvents or solvent mixtures.<br>
Within the context of this invention, solvents are organic solvents and water, or a mixture of organic solvents or a mixture of organic solvents and water.<br>
Organic solvents are, for example, protic or aprotic polare organic solvents, such as alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, butanol or glycols, especially isopropanol, or nitrile, such as acetonitrile or propionitrile, or amide, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide or N-methylpyridine, or sulfoxide, such as dimethylsulfoxide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The ratio by weight of compound of formula (8) to the solvent is generally in the range from 20 to 90% by weight, especially in the range from 30 to 60% by weight.<br>
The prepared product may be advantageously worked up and isolated, and if desired be purified.<br>
Customary, the work up starts by decreasing the temperature of the reaction mixture in the range from 280 to 300 K, especially in the range from 290 to 300 K.<br><br>
It may be of advantageous to decrease the temperature slowly, over a period of several hours.<br>
In general, the reaction product is usually filtered and then washed with water or a salt solution and subsequently dried.<br>
Filtration is normally carried out in standard filtering equipment, for example Buchner funnels, filter presses, pressurised suction filters, preferably in vacuo.<br>
The temperature for the drying is dependent on the pressure applied. Drying is usually carried out in vacuo at 50-200 mbar.<br>
The drying is usually carried out at a temperature in the range from 313 to 363 K, especially from 323 to 353 K, and more especially in the range from 328 to 348 K.<br>
It has proved advantageous for the product to be purified by recrystallisation after it has been isolated.<br>
Organic solvents and solvent mixtures are suitable for the recrystallisation. Preference is given to alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or butanol, especially 2-propanol.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) according to the invention are suitable for dyeing organic material, such as keratin, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, especially keratin-containing fibers, cotton or nylon, and preferably human hair.<br>
Special preference is given to colouring compositions for the colouring of hair. Further additives that are suitable for such compositions include additives that are customary in hair-colouring, for example further dyes, surfactants, solvents, perfumes, polymeric adjuvants, thickeners and light stabilisers.<br>
The diversity of shades and the colour fastness of the dye mixtures used in accordance with the invention can be increased by combination with other dyes used in the field of hair-<br><br>
colouring compositions. They can be combined very readily both with oxidation dyes and with direct dyes, it being possible for the latter to be of anionic or cationic nature or uncharged.<br>
In all colouring compositions, it is also possible for a plurality of different colourants to be used together; likewise, it is possible for a plurality of different oxidation dye precursors from the group of the developer and coupler compounds to be used together, for example aromatic compounds having a primary or secondary amino group, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, aromatic hydroxy compounds or amino acids, as described, for example, in German Patent Application 197 17 224.5.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention produce colour shades in the range from yellow to blue, and the fastness properties are outstanding. Attention is drawn to the excellent fastness to light and fastness to washing properties and to their property that enables hair that has already been coloured a dark colour still to be distinctly altered in shade.<br>
In a further embodiment, for the purpose of further modification of colour shades the colouring compositions according to the invention also comprise, in addition to the dye mixtures according to the invention, customary direct dyes, for example from the group of the nitroanilines, nitrophenylenediamines, nitroaminophenols, anthraquinones, indophenols, phenazines, phenothiazines and methines.<br>
Also very suitable for combination with the dye mixtures according to the invention are cationised nitroaniline and anthraquinone dyes, for example those described in the following patent specifications: US-5 298 029, US-5 360 930, US-5 169 403, US-5 256 823, US-5 135 543, EP-A-818 193, US-5 486 629 and EP-A-758 547.<br>
Also, cationic direct dyes such as cationic azo dyes, for example according to<br>
GB-A-2 319 776, as well as the oxazine dyes described in DE-A-299 12 327 and mixtures<br>
thereof with the other direct dyes mentioned therein, are likewise suitable for combination.<br>
Cationic direct dyes, for example according to WO 95/01772, WO 95/15144, EP 714 954 and EP 318 294, are also suitable for combination.<br><br>
In addition, the colouring compositions according to the invention may also comprise naturally occurring dyes, for example henna red, henna neutral, henna black, camomile blossom, sandalwood, black tea, Rhamnus frangula bark, sage, campeche wood, madder root, catechu, sedre and alkanet root. Such colouring methods are described, for example, in EP-A-404 868.<br>
In respect of further customary dye components, reference is made expressly to the series "Dermatology", edited by Ch. Culnan, H. Maibach, Verlag Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, Basle, 1986, Vol. 7, Ch. Zviak, The Science of Hair Care, chapter 7, pages 248-250 (direct dyes), and chapter 8, pages 264 - 267 (oxidation dyes), and to "Europaisches Inventar der Kosmetikrohstoffe", 1996, published by The European Commission, obtainable in diskette form from the Bundesverband der deutschen Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen fur Arzneimittel, Reformwaren und Kdrperpflegemittel e.V., Mannheim.<br>
It is not necessary for the oxidation dye precursors, where present, or for the dyes each to be single compounds, but rather the colouring compositions according to the invention may additionally comprise, depending on the preparation procedures for the individual dyes, lesser amounts of further components, provided such components do not have an adverse effect on the colouring result or do not need to be excluded for other reasons, for example toxicological reasons.<br>
The dye mixtures according to the invention may also readily be used in combination with other dyes and/or adjuvants used in the colouring of hair, for example with<br>
•	oxidising agents to achieve lightened colorations, as described in EP-A-810 851,<br>
•	oxidising agents in the form of permanent-wave fixing solution, as described in DE-A-197 13 698 or WO 99/40895,<br>
•	oxidation dyeing compositions, as described in EP-A-850 636, EP-A-850 637, EP-A-850 638 and EP-A-852 135,<br>
•	oxidation dyes in the presence of oxidoreductase enzyme, as described in WO 99/17730 and WO 99/36034,<br>
•	autooxidisable oxidation dyes, as described in WO 99/20234, or<br>
•	nitrobenzene derivatives, as described in WO 99/20235.<br><br>
The colouring compositions according to the invention produce intense colorations even at physiologically tolerable temperatures of less than 45°C. They are accordingly suitable especially for colouring human hair. For use on human hair, the colouring compositions can usually be incorporated into an aqueous cosmetic carrier. Suitable aqueous cosmetic carriers include, for example, creams, emulsions, gels and also surfactant-containing foaming solutions, e.g. shampoos or other preparations, that are suitable for use on keratin-containing fibres. Such forms of use are described in detail in Research Disclosure 42448 (August 1999). If necessary, it is also possible to incorporate the colouring compositions into anhydrous carriers, as described, for example, in US-3 369 970. The colouring compositions according to the invention are also outstandingly suitable for the colouring method described in DE-A-3 829 870 using a colouring comb or colouring brush.<br>
The colouring compositions according to the invention may furthermore comprise any active ingredient, additive or adjuvant known for such preparations. The colouring compositions in many cases comprise at least one surfactant, there being suitable in principle anionic and also zwitterionic, ampholytic and non-ionic surfactants. In many cases, however, it has proved advantageous to select the surfactants from anionic and non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Anionic surfactants suitable for use in preparations according to the invention include any anionic surface-active substance that is suitable for use on the human body. Such a substance is characterised by an anionic group that imparts water solubility, for example a carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate group, and a lipophilic alkyl group having approximately from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. In addition, glycol or polyglycol ether groups, ester, ether and amide groups and also hydroxy groups may be present in the molecule. Examples of suitable anionic surfactants, each in the form of sodium, potassium or ammonium salts or mono-, di- or tri-alkanolammonium salts having 2 or 3 carbon atoms in the alkanol group, are:<br>
-	linear fatty acids having from 10 to 22 carbon atoms (soaps),<br>
-	ether carboxylic acids of formula R-0-(CH2-CH2-0)x-CH2-COOH, in which R is a linear alkyl group having from 10 to 22 carbon atoms and x = 0 or from 1 to 16,<br>
-	acyl sarcosides having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the acyl group,<br><br>
-	acyl taurides having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the acyl group,<br>
-	acyl isothionates having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the acyl group,<br>
-	sulfosuccinic acid mono- and di-alkyl esters having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and sulfosuccinic acid monoalkylpolyoxyethyl esters having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and from 1 to 6 oxyethyl groups,<br>

-	linear a-olefin sulfonates having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms,<br>
-	a-sulfo fatty acid methyl esters of fatty acids having from 12 to 18 carbon atoms,<br>
-	alkyl sulfates and alkyl polyglycol ether sulfates of formula R'-0(CH2-CH2-0))<:-s03h in which r is a preferably linear alkyl group having from to carbon atoms and x or></:-s03h>
-	mixtures of surface-active hydroxysulfonates according to DE-A-3 725 030,<br>
-	sulfated hydroxyalkylpolyethylene and/or hydroxyalkylenepropylene glycol ethers according to DE-A-3 723 354,<br>
-	sulfonates of unsaturated fatty acids having from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and from 1 to 6 double bonds according to DE-A-3 926 344,<br>
-	esters of tartaric acid and citric acid with alcohols that are addition products of approximately from 2 to 15 molecules of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants are alkyl sulfates, alkyl polyglycol ether sulfates and ether carboxylic acids having from 10 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and up to 12 glycol ether groups in the molecule, and also especially salts of saturated and especially<br><br>
unsaturated C8-C22carboxylic acids, such as oleic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid and palmitic acid.<br>
The term "zwitterionic surfactants" denotes surface-active compounds that carry at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one -COO(_) or -S03(_) group in the molecule. Zwitterionic surfactants that are especially suitable are the so-called betaines, such as the N-alkyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoalkyldimethylammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoacylaminopropyldimethylammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethylimidazolines each having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or acyl group and also cocoacylaminoethylhydroxyethylcarboxymethyl glycinate. A preferred zwitterionic surfactant is the fatty acid amide derivative known by the CTFA name cocamidopropyl betaine.<br>
Ampholytic surfactants are to be understood as meaning surface-active compounds that, in addition to a C8-C18-alkyl or -acyl group, contain at least one free amino group and at least one -COOH or -SO3H group in the molecule and are capable of forming internal salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants include N-alkylglycines, N-alkylpropionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamido-propylglycines, N-alkyltaurines, N-alkylsarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids, each having approximately from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Ampholytic surfactants to which special preference is given are N-cocoalkylamino-propionate, cocoacylaminoethylaminopropionate and Ci2-C18acylsarcosine.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants contain as the hydrophilic group, for example, a polyol group, a polyalkylene glycol ether group or a combination of polyol and polyglycol ether groups.<br>
Such compounds are, for example:<br>
- addition products of from 2 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide and/or from 0 to 5 mol of propylene oxide with linear fatty alcohols having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, with fatty acids having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and with alkylphenols having from 8 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl group,<br><br>
-	C12-C22 fatty acid mono- and di-esters of addition products of from 1 to 30 mol of ethylene oxide with glycerol,<br>
-	C1-C22alkyl-mono- and -oligo-glycosides and ethoxylated analogues thereof,<br>
-	addition products of from 5 to 60 mol of ethylene oxide with castor oil and hydrogenated castor oil,<br>
-	addition products of ethylene oxide with sorbitan fatty acid esters,<br>
-	addition products of ethylene oxide with fatty acid alkanolamides.<br>
The alkyl-group-containing compounds used as surfactants may be single substances, but the use as starting materials of natural raw materials of vegetable or animal origin is generally preferred in the preparation of such substances, with the result that the substance mixtures obtained have different alkyl chain lengths according to the particular starting material used.<br>
The surfactants that are addition products of ethylene and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols or derivatives of such addition products may either be products having a "normal" homologue distribution or products having a restricted homologue distribution. "Normal" homologue distribution is to be understood as meaning mixtures of homologues obtained in the reaction of fatty alcohol and alkylene oxide using alkali metals, alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal alcoholates as catalysts. Restricted homologue distributions, on the other hand, are obtained when, for example, hydrotalcites, alkali metal salts of ether carboxylic acids, alkali metal oxides, hydroxides or alcoholates are used as catalysts. The use of products having restricted homologue distribution may be preferred.<br>
Examples of further active ingredients, adjuvants and additives are:<br>
-	non-ionic polymers, for example vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acrylate copolymers, polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone and vinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymers and polysiloxanes,<br><br>

-	thickeners, such as agar, guar gum, alginates, xanthan gum, gum arabic, karaya gum, locust bean flour, linseed gums, dextrans, cellulose derivatives, e.g. methyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyi cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, starch fractions and derivatives, such as amylose, amylopectin and dextrins, clays, e.g. bentonite or fully synthetic hydrocolloids such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
-	structuring agents, such as glucose and maleic acid,<br>
-	hair-conditioning compounds, such as phospholipids, for example soya lecithin, egg lecithin and cephalins, silicone oils, and also conditioning compounds, for example such as those described in DE-A-197 29 080, EP-A-834 303 or EP-A-312 343,<br>
-	protein hydrolysates, especially elastin, collagen, keratin, milk protein, soya protein and wheat protein hydrolysates, condensation products thereof with fatty acids and also quatemised protein hydrolysates,<br>

The constituents of the aqueous carrier are used in the preparation of the colouring compositions according to the invention in the amounts customary for that purpose; for example emulsifiers are used in concentrations of from 0.5 to 30 % by weight and thickeners in concentrations of from 0.1 to 25 % by weight of the total colouring composition.<br>
To colour keratin-containing fibres, especially to colour human hair, the colouring compositions are usually applied to the hair in an amount of from 50 to 100 g in the form of the aqueous cosmetic carrier, left on the hair for approximately 30 minutes and then rinsed off or washed off with a commercially available hair shampoo.<br><br>
The colouring compositions used in accordance with the invention and the optionally used oxidation dye precursors may be applied to the keratin-containing fibres either simultaneously or successively, the order in which they are applied being unimportant.<br>
The colouring compositions used in accordance with the invention and the optionally used oxidation dye precursors may be stored either separately or together, either in a liquid to paste-like preparation (aqueous or non-aqueous) or in the form of a dry powder. When the components are stored together in a liquid preparation, the preparation should be substantially anhydrous in order to reduce reaction of the components. When they are stored separately, the reactive components are intimately mixed with one another only immediately before use. In the case of dry storage, before use a defined amount of hot (from 50 to 80°C) water is usually added and a homogeneous mixture prepared.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention without limiting the invention thereto. Unless specified otherwise, parts and percentages relate to weight. The amounts of dye specified are relative to the material being coloured.<br><br>
