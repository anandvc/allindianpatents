				<td>Pasteurising installation<br>
The invention refers to a pasteurising installation for the pasteurisation of products<br>
in containers as per the generic term of claim 1<br>
In the beverage industry, it is in particular used in easily perishable goods, to<br>
pasteurise these items. In known pasteurising installations, therein the containers are<br>
delivered with the products in practically uniform movement from entry area to the<br>
exit area. During this movement these are heated up till these have picked up the<br>
desired pasteurising units, thereafter cooled, with which the pasteurising process is<br>
completed. A pasteurising passage planned for this has accordingly, a heating up<br>
section, a super heating and pasteurising section with a following cooling section.<br>
The individual sections can have further sub zones. The gradual heating up and<br>
cooling down ensured through it is in particular preferred for the glass bottles used<br>
in the beverage industry in order to avoid a destruction of glass bottles through abrupt<br>
change of temperature. The heat transmission to the products contained in the<br>
containers takes place normally through spraying of these containers with water,<br>
which are moved forward on a conveyor belt which permits the spray liquid to pass<br>
through downward. Below the conveyor belt the collecting containers for the spray<br>
liquid are brought, from which the pumps for the spray are fed. Between the heating<br>
up and cooling down sections zone wise heat can be exchanged with the spray liquid.<br>
In order to reach an optimum gradation of temperature in the individual sections,<br>
these are correspondingly subdivided. Mostly, the section "heating up" has three to<br>
four individual zones, the pasteurizing area has two to three zones, in doing so yet<br>
a super heating zone can be planned before the pasteurising zone. The adjoining<br>
section "cooling down" has again three to four individual zones in whiGh the<br>
containers are cooled down through a stepwise decreasing temperature of the spray<br>
liquid up to the desired exit temperature.<br>
The spray temperatures adjusted in each case are matched exactly to the product,<br>
the length of the zones and the speed of the conveyors, so that it is ensured that<br>
the product contained in the containers attains the specified degree of pasteurisation.<br>
For the purpose of spray of the containers, in the pasteurising unit housing, trans-<br>
verse to the delivery direction a multiple number of spray tubes with spray nozzles<br>
or spray openings maintained at spacings adjacent to each other and a sidewise<br>
liquid feed are provided. Spray tubes of this type are known as for example from<br>
the DE 29716644. Proceeding from a such pasteurising installation the assignment<br>
lies at the base of the invention to reduce the required manufacturing-, erection-and<br>
commissioning cost of these installations as well as of their pasteurising unit housing<br>
and to procure standardised housing module for preferably almost all execution<br>
types.<br>
This assignment lying at the base of the invention is now solved through it that the<br>
passage housing is built in modular design out of any number of flexible,interchangeable<br>
segments, in doing so these segments run transverse or longitudinal to the delivery<br>
direction of pasteurising unit and may be positioned and placed serially one after<br>
the other on zonal tanks and/or hot water tanks showing parallel or longitudinal to<br>
this delivery direction.<br>
With this design and the features represented in further claims as well as in<br>
description supplements simple housing base modules are present which show a high<br>
equal part share and which permit a series production of many components. Moreo-<br>
ver, it provides a flexible zonal structure for an optimum machine lay out, in doing<br>
so on the whole the standardised housing modules are suitable for almost all execu-<br>
tion types of heat treatment machines for containers like pasteurising unit, recooler,<br>
heater and so on.<br>
In the following the invention is explained closer with the help of a diagram with<br>
Figures 1 to 5 representing an execution example.<br>
In Figure 1 and the following description, in addition to this, first it is referred to a<br>
general pasteurising installation and the course of it's process.<br>
In the Figures 2 to 5 then the corresponding housing structure in shape of an<br>
execution example is explained.<br>
Therefore, the pasteurising installation comprises a heating section 2 assembled in<br>
flow direction of the respective container 1 in starting area, which can again com-<br>
prise a multiple number of individual zones 5-7, in doing so the heating phase is<br>
taken up correspondingly carefully. A super heating zone 8 connects to a heating<br>
section 2 this follows the actual pasteurising zone 9. Connectingly the area of the<br>
cooling section 4 starts which like aiso in other sections, can comprise a larger<br>
number of individual zones 10-12.<br>
The operating program of such a pasteurising installation is laid out first for the<br>
pasteurising operation under optimum conditions. Thus it is as for example planned<br>
that the first heating zone 5 shows a spray temperature of 18°C. Correspondingly<br>
the exit temperature of the pasteurised products is planned with a spray temperature<br>
of 17°C. The second heating zone 6 shows a spray temperature of slightly above<br>
24°C, in doing so the cooling zone communicating with it can again He slightly lower<br>
at 23°C. At the example of both these zones it is identifiable that the water out of<br>
the zones "cooling" 4 in each case is supplied to the zone in section "heating 2"<br>
whose desired heating temperature comes nearest to the desired cooling tempera-<br>
ture. For balancing of the respective temperature difference, preferably water from<br>
the first tank 13 is supplied in minor amount to water out of cooling section 4, whose<br>
water of higher temperature comes from the last station 7 of the heating section 2.<br>
In connection to the heating section the superheating zone 8 is located whose<br>
temperature is again higher than the temperature of the last heating zone 7 and is<br>
fed from a second container 15 with higher temperature in contrast to the first<br>
container 13. A third container 16 is allocated to the second container 15 to which<br>
the excess water of the container 15 is supplied. This third container 16 is in addition<br>
maintained at a predetermined higher temperature by means of a heating equipment.<br>
From this container 16 also the super heating- and pasteurising zone 8, 9 are<br>
serviced, in doing so the draining hot water quantity is collected in the second<br>
container 15 and is mixed with hot water of the third container 16.<br>
in case of an arising disturbance, as for example caused through a container back<br>
pressure in the pasteurizing installation, through a not further represented control<br>
equipment a careful activation of definite valves is taken up, so that as for example<br>
the water of less temperature is supplied from the fixed container 13 to the super<br>
heating- and/or pasteurising zone 8, 9.<br>
Likewise water of less temperature can be supplied to other sections 2, 4 as for<br>
example to a fourth container 14.<br>
The device itself, as per the Figure 2 to 5 in shape of a pasteurising unit housing,<br>
is a modular housing construction out of multiple number of segments, in doing so,<br>
the lower structure out of pre erected zone tank 21 comprise the pipelines,valves and<br>
wiring to which sidewise the pipelines 22 in joint or individual segments are allocated.<br>
From these at spacing the segments 24 of hot water buffer tanks run. The free space<br>
remaining in between is planned as crawling way 25 for maintenance cases, as<br>
Figure 2 shows.<br>
In Figure 3 the interchangeable and flexible segment 6 of the real passage housing<br>
is represented. These individual segments contain the conveyor belt substructure with<br>
a back strand support as well as the spray distributor and a lid structure preferably<br>
with external ribbings. The side openings 28 are sealable with side panels 29 which<br>
may be brought sidewise. The passage segments 26 are put on as per Figure 4<br>
transverse to the convey device of pasteurizing unit running on the zone tank 21 and<br>
the hot water tank 24 located for this at distance. The passage segments 26 are<br>
equipped in the base area with sliding items, assembly rolls or rearrangeable sliding<br>
rolls for the simplified local shifting and are to be placed in horizontal level which<br>
may be moved as well as may be lined up in series to each other.<br>
In this way the passage segments 26 form as per Figure 5 a compact housing<br>
structure 30 which form through front sided pre connection of the actual inlet - and<br>
outlet segment 31 a complete, each time reducable or expandable pasteurizing<br>
installation. Therein the machine width forms on the whole also the treatment width,<br>
in doing so the compact housing structure is limited purely by narrow side panels<br>
29. These are held sealing free in the side wall formations 20 of the segments 26<br>
and purposefully supported in a water carrying lower frame 32. In place of this<br>
passage segments aligned transverse to the delivery device of the pasteurizing unit,<br>
also segments can be used which may be lined up one after the other in series<br>
parallel to the delivery direction, in doing so the substructures run in shape of tanks<br>
21 and 24 transverse to the actual delivery direction.<br>
The frame of the segments 26 can as for example be shaped out of tubes, square<br>
tubes or the equivalent. The outfit parts like spray tubes, spray distributors, delivery<br>
goods sub structure, back strand support and further are preferably integral com-<br>
ponent of the segment construction and consequently are also planned for the<br>
stiffening of the system. The standardised housing segments are built in form of<br>
assembly structure groups, in doing so their dimensions correspond to the permitted<br>
usual container sizes as for example of a ship-or sea container.<br>
The zone tanks can additionally be equipped with endless- belt screen dirt- and<br>
fragment conveyors. In the regenerative zone a cascading cooling or hot water run<br>
is planned for optimum utilisation of the energy of hot or cooling water. The water<br>
management is taken up over stepped weirs in doing so the level of the zones is<br>
maintained through suitable medium like as for example corresponding sensors and<br>
frequency regulated pumps.<br>
The erection of pasteurization installation takes place preferably as per the features<br>
of the claims 15, to which it is referred correspondingly.<br>
