3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing g-nitrophosphonates. More particularly, the invention relates to process of preparation of g-nitrophosphonates reacting phosphonate stabilized carbanion to nitroalkenes selectively comprising steps of asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric induction, i.e. without using any chiral source.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Last few decades have seen development of chiral catalysis to an extent where it can be thought of biomimicking. However, source of pure enantiomer still beholds in the technique of classic resolution, biochemical and biological methods. This is due to the fact that most of the asymmetric reactions are not absolute in the sense of selectivity. The present invention envisages that the autocatalytic amplification can be critical leading to the utilization of general reactions where enantiomeric excess is anything but absolute. The exclusion of external ligand for catalysis save costs to a great extent and also removes the necessity to separate the product from catalyst which could further prove economical in commercial applications.<br>
The origin of homochirality and the chemical routes mimicking the process leading to high enantiomeric enrichment of organic compounds generated great interest in the past few years. Soai reaction was pivotal which led to utilization of several chiral initiators including product itself in these reactions [Chirality 2006, 18, 469-478]. However, only a rare set of reactions with very limited substrate scope is known to show asymmetric autocatalytic amplification (AAA). A recent report demonstrated<br><br><br>
Mannich reaction of acetone with (E)-ethyl 2-(4-methoxyphenylimino)acetate [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 393-396]. Another report shows the phenomenon with moderate amplification in Mannich and aldol reactions [Chirality 2007, 19, 816-825]. The milestone of breaking the symmetry and absolute asymmetric synthesis are even rarer [Mirror symmetry breaking: Chem. Rev. 2003, 103, 3369-3400; Absolute asymmetric synthesis (3 papers, 1 patent): Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2003, 14, 185-188; Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 4337-4339; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10010-10011; Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho 9,268,179,1997].<br>
The Soai reaction, i.e. addition of organozinc compounds to aldehydes, works with only a few substrates and the report on Mannich reaction is based on only one example of substrates (references; vide supra). These reactions are generally based on weak interactions which are very sensitive to minor change in electronic and steric factors. On practical hand, the best condition [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 315-317] takes at least three steps for amplification upto &gt;99% ee after addition of product of low ee's as the chiral catalyst.<br>
The main disadvantage with the prior art is that the projected speculations for these reactions in the presence of product as the chiral catalyst require three steps to attain such enantioselectivities and in the absence of any catalyst for which the prior art is also limited to a specific reaction, i.e. addition of dialkyl zinc to an aromatic aldehyde, the selectivities are only moderate. The existing process for preparation of aminophosphonates requires addition of other chiral catalysts such as cinchonine [Tetrahedron:Asymmetry,,2001',18, 2719]. Such types of processes are cumbersome and costly.<br><br><br>
Thus, there is a need for development in terms of a process for preparation of nitrophosphonates, more particularly, y-nitrophosphonates which would be first and cost effective.<br>
The present inventors have found a process which by adopting selectively asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric synthesis in Michael addition produces an amplification of greater than 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) in one step which is about three times superior to that of Soai reaction in literature. The products synthesized and their derivatives are possible drug candidates and their asymmetric synthesis was highly desirable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing y-nitrophosphonates with high stereoselectivity and chemical yields.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a methodology which can serve the above purpose by autocatalysis in the presence/absence of any chiral/achiral ligand. This provides a highly commercially viable process for y-nitrophosphonates giving an access to several well known biologically active molecules (e.g. y-aminophosphonic acid, [Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 1991, /, 501]) in enantiopure form.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to take this field a step ahead so that the plethora of asymmetric reactions can also gain practical importance by contributing to pool of pure enantiomers.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric synthesis (i.e. achieving enantioselectivity without any catalyst or additive) in the Michael addition of alkyl and benzyl phosphonates to nitroalkenes.<br>
A typical procedure involves the following steps:<br>
(i)       mixing of phosphonate at low temperature (-78 °C) in freshly prepared<br>
LDA solution in THF for an hour thereby forming phosphonate stabilized<br>
carbanion; <br>
(ii)      addition of nitroalkene (with the same product, non-racemic, in the case of<br>
asymmetric autocatalysis,  racemic,  in the  case  of mirror symmetry<br>
breaking and none in the case of absolute asymmetric synthesis) and (iii)      further mixing till completion of the reaction<br>
(iv)	quenching the reaction mixture by saturated aqueous NH4C1 solution and <br>
(v)       extracting by ethyl acetate after saturating with brine.<br><br><br>
In case of solid product, the product is washed by isopropanol/hexane (1:10) after trituration and further recrystallization with CH2Cl2/hexane (1:10) to afford chemically pure product. In case of liquid product, the residue is purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/pet ether, 0-50%, gradient elution).<br>
The methodology proved to be general after screening various phosphonates (benzyl, naphthyl, p-chlorobenzyl and methyl) and nitroalkenes (p-chloronitrostyrene and p-methoxynitrostyrene).<br>
Non-racemic catalysts with enantiomeric excess (R,R) or (S,S) provides the same enantiomers as products in excellent yields. The substrates undergo &gt;50% conversion within a minute of reaction in high ee's. The rate of reaction is greater in the mirror symmetry breaking experiment by using racemic catalyst as compared to that of absolute asymmetric synthesis.<br>
The stereoselectivity may vary according to the solvent/mixture concentration (e.g. 1/4-1/8 molar), but the preferred concentration is 1/6 molar.<br>
The reaction mixture can be brought to ambient temperature after addition of all the reagents to give the product in good yields without much depletion in stereoselectivity, but a common procedure best suited to all the substrates needs 8 h of low temperature with 10 h of stirring at room temperature.<br>
The reaction is sensitive to additives and solvent, but the best solvent is found to be THF.<br>
The invention is now illustrated with a few but non-limiting examples (See Tables 1-3).<br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of diethyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-nitro-l-phenylpropylphosphonate 3a<br><br>
A solution of LDA (1.5 mmol) was prepared by dropwise addition of w-BuLi (2.4 ml, 1.5 mmol, 1.6 M solution in hexanes) to diisopropylamine (0.21 ml, 152 mg, 1.5 mmol) in THF (2 ml) at 0 °C followed by stirring for 30 min at the same temperature. To this freshly prepared LDA, cooled to -78 °C, was added dropwise phosphonate 2a (114 mg, 0.5 mmol) in THF (1 ml). After stirring the reaction mixture for 1 h, catalyst 3a (21 mg, 0.05 mmol, non-racemic, racemic or none, see Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and nitroalkene la (138 mg, 0.75 mmol) in THF (1 ml) were added to the reaction mixture and the temperature was maintained at -78 °C for an additional 8 h. The reaction mixture was warmed to ambient temperature and stirring continued for 10 h. The time at -78 °C can be varied with minor (~1%) depletion in stereoselectivity. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4C1 (2 ml), further saturated with NaCl and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 10 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (5 ml), dried (anhyd Na2S04) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturated, washed by isopropanol/hexane (1:10, 3 x 1 ml) and recrystallized from CH2Cl2/hexane (1:10) to afford the pure product. Notably, the product can be prepared with high purity without involvement of column chromatography in case of solid products.<br><br><br>

To this freshly prepared LDA, cooled to -78 °C, was added dropwise phosphonate 2d (0.075 mg, 0.5 mmol)in THF (1 ml).

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing g-nitrophosphonates. More particularly, the invention relates to process of preparation of g-nitrophosphonates reacting phosphonate stabilized carbanion to nitroalkenes selectively comprising steps of asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric induction, i.e. without using any chiral source.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Last few decades have seen development of chiral catalysis to an extent where it can be thought of biomimicking. However, source of pure enantiomer still beholds in the technique of classic resolution, biochemical and biological methods. This is due to the fact that most of the asymmetric reactions are not absolute in the sense of selectivity. The present invention envisages that the autocatalytic amplification can be critical leading to the utilization of general reactions where enantiomeric excess is anything but absolute. The exclusion of external ligand for catalysis save costs to a great extent and also removes the necessity to separate the product from catalyst which could further prove economical in commercial applications.<br>
The origin of homochirality and the chemical routes mimicking the process leading to high enantiomeric enrichment of organic compounds generated great interest in the past few years. Soai reaction was pivotal which led to utilization of several chiral initiators including product itself in these reactions [Chirality 2006, 18, 469-478]. However, only a rare set of reactions with very limited substrate scope is known to show asymmetric autocatalytic amplification (AAA). A recent report demonstrated<br><br><br>
Mannich reaction of acetone with (E)-ethyl 2-(4-methoxyphenylimino)acetate [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 393-396]. Another report shows the phenomenon with moderate amplification in Mannich and aldol reactions [Chirality 2007, 19, 816-825]. The milestone of breaking the symmetry and absolute asymmetric synthesis are even rarer [Mirror symmetry breaking: Chem. Rev. 2003, 103, 3369-3400; Absolute asymmetric synthesis (3 papers, 1 patent): Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2003, 14, 185-188; Org. Lett. 2003, 5, 4337-4339; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10010-10011; Japan Kokai Tokkyo Koho 9,268,179,1997].<br>
The Soai reaction, i.e. addition of organozinc compounds to aldehydes, works with only a few substrates and the report on Mannich reaction is based on only one example of substrates (references; vide supra). These reactions are generally based on weak interactions which are very sensitive to minor change in electronic and steric factors. On practical hand, the best condition [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 315-317] takes at least three steps for amplification upto &gt;99% ee after addition of product of low ee's as the chiral catalyst.<br>
The main disadvantage with the prior art is that the projected speculations for these reactions in the presence of product as the chiral catalyst require three steps to attain such enantioselectivities and in the absence of any catalyst for which the prior art is also limited to a specific reaction, i.e. addition of dialkyl zinc to an aromatic aldehyde, the selectivities are only moderate. The existing process for preparation of aminophosphonates requires addition of other chiral catalysts such as cinchonine [Tetrahedron:Asymmetry,,2001',18, 2719]. Such types of processes are cumbersome and costly.<br><br><br>
Thus, there is a need for development in terms of a process for preparation of nitrophosphonates, more particularly, y-nitrophosphonates which would be first and cost effective.<br>
The present inventors have found a process which by adopting selectively asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric synthesis in Michael addition produces an amplification of greater than 99% enantiomeric excess (ee) in one step which is about three times superior to that of Soai reaction in literature. The products synthesized and their derivatives are possible drug candidates and their asymmetric synthesis was highly desirable.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing y-nitrophosphonates with high stereoselectivity and chemical yields.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a methodology which can serve the above purpose by autocatalysis in the presence/absence of any chiral/achiral ligand. This provides a highly commercially viable process for y-nitrophosphonates giving an access to several well known biologically active molecules (e.g. y-aminophosphonic acid, [Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters 1991, /, 501]) in enantiopure form.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to take this field a step ahead so that the plethora of asymmetric reactions can also gain practical importance by contributing to pool of pure enantiomers.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to asymmetric autocatalysis, mirror symmetry breaking and absolute asymmetric synthesis (i.e. achieving enantioselectivity without any catalyst or additive) in the Michael addition of alkyl and benzyl phosphonates to nitroalkenes.<br>
A typical procedure involves the following steps:<br>
(i)       mixing of phosphonate at low temperature (-78 °C) in freshly prepared<br>
LDA solution in THF for an hour thereby forming phosphonate stabilized<br>
carbanion; <br>
(ii)      addition of nitroalkene (with the same product, non-racemic, in the case of<br>
asymmetric autocatalysis,  racemic,  in the  case  of mirror symmetry<br>
breaking and none in the case of absolute asymmetric synthesis) and (iii)      further mixing till completion of the reaction<br>
(iv)	quenching the reaction mixture by saturated aqueous NH4C1 solution and <br>
(v)       extracting by ethyl acetate after saturating with brine.<br><br><br>
In case of solid product, the product is washed by isopropanol/hexane (1:10) after trituration and further recrystallization with CH2Cl2/hexane (1:10) to afford chemically pure product. In case of liquid product, the residue is purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/pet ether, 0-50%, gradient elution).<br>
The methodology proved to be general after screening various phosphonates (benzyl, naphthyl, p-chlorobenzyl and methyl) and nitroalkenes (p-chloronitrostyrene and p-methoxynitrostyrene).<br>
Non-racemic catalysts with enantiomeric excess (R,R) or (S,S) provides the same enantiomers as products in excellent yields. The substrates undergo &gt;50% conversion within a minute of reaction in high ee's. The rate of reaction is greater in the mirror symmetry breaking experiment by using racemic catalyst as compared to that of absolute asymmetric synthesis.<br>
The stereoselectivity may vary according to the solvent/mixture concentration (e.g. 1/4-1/8 molar), but the preferred concentration is 1/6 molar.<br>
The reaction mixture can be brought to ambient temperature after addition of all the reagents to give the product in good yields without much depletion in stereoselectivity, but a common procedure best suited to all the substrates needs 8 h of low temperature with 10 h of stirring at room temperature.<br>
The reaction is sensitive to additives and solvent, but the best solvent is found to be THF.<br>
The invention is now illustrated with a few but non-limiting examples (See Tables 1-3).<br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of diethyl 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-nitro-l-phenylpropylphosphonate 3a<br><br>
A solution of LDA (1.5 mmol) was prepared by dropwise addition of w-BuLi (2.4 ml, 1.5 mmol, 1.6 M solution in hexanes) to diisopropylamine (0.21 ml, 152 mg, 1.5 mmol) in THF (2 ml) at 0 °C followed by stirring for 30 min at the same temperature. To this freshly prepared LDA, cooled to -78 °C, was added dropwise phosphonate 2a (114 mg, 0.5 mmol) in THF (1 ml). After stirring the reaction mixture for 1 h, catalyst 3a (21 mg, 0.05 mmol, non-racemic, racemic or none, see Tables 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and nitroalkene la (138 mg, 0.75 mmol) in THF (1 ml) were added to the reaction mixture and the temperature was maintained at -78 °C for an additional 8 h. The reaction mixture was warmed to ambient temperature and stirring continued for 10 h. The time at -78 °C can be varied with minor (~1%) depletion in stereoselectivity. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4C1 (2 ml), further saturated with NaCl and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 10 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (5 ml), dried (anhyd Na2S04) and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturated, washed by isopropanol/hexane (1:10, 3 x 1 ml) and recrystallized from CH2Cl2/hexane (1:10) to afford the pure product. Notably, the product can be prepared with high purity without involvement of column chromatography in case of solid products.<br><br><br>

To this freshly prepared LDA, cooled to -78 °C, was added dropwise phosphonate 2d (0.075 mg, 0.5 mmol)in THF (1 ml).
