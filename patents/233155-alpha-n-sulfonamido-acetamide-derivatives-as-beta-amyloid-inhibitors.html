				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides novel α-(N-sulfonamido)acetamide compounds having drug and bio-affecting properties, their pharmaceutical compositions and method of use. In particular, the invention is concerned with α-(N-arylsulfonamido)acetamides. These compounds possess unique inhibition of the ß-amyloid peptide (ß-AP) production, thereby acting to prevent the accumulation of amyloid protein deposits in the brain. More particularly, the present invention relates to the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD is characterized pathologically by the accumulation of senile (neuritic) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid deposition in neural tissues and vessels, synaptic loss, and neuronal death. It is the most common form of dementia and it now represents the third leading cause of death after cardiovascular disorders and cancer. The cost of Alzheimer's Disease is enormous (in the U.S., greater than $100 billion annually) and includes the suffering of the patients, the suffering of families, and the lost productivity of patients and caregivers. As the longevity of society increases, the occurrence of AD will markedly increase. It is estimated that more than 10 million Americans will suffer from AD by the year 2020, if methods for prevention and treatment are not found. Currently, AD is estimated to afflict 10% of the population over age 65 and up to 50% of those over the age<br><br><br>
of 85. No treatment that effectively prevents AD or reverses the clinical symptoms and underlying pathophysiology is currently available (for review see Selkoe, D.J. Ann. Rev. CellBiol, 1994.10: 373-403).<br>
There have been many theories relating to the etiology and pathogenesis of AD. These theories were either based on analogies with other diseases and conditions (e.g., slow virus and aluminum theories), or based on pathologic observations (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, or tangle theories). Genetic analysis can potentially differentiate between competing theories. The identification of mutations in the P-amyloid precursor protein (P-APP) of individuals prone to early onset forms of AD and related disorders strongly supports the amyloidogenic theories.<br>
Histopathological examination of brain tissue derived upon autopsy or from neurosurgical specimens hi affected individuals reveals the occurrence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillar tangles hi the cerebral cortex of such patients. Similar alterations are observed in patients with Trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome). Biochemical and immunological studies reveal that the dominant proteinaceous component of the amyloid plaque is an approximately 4.2 kilodalton (kD) protein of about 39 to 43 amino acids. This protein is designated Ap, p-amyloid peptide, and sometimes P/A4; referred to herein as Ap. In addition to its deposition hi amyloid plaques, Ap is also found in the walls of meningeal and parenchymal arterioles, small arteries, capillaries, and sometimes, venules. Compelling evidence accumulated during the last decade reveals mat Ap is an internal polypeptide derived from a type 1 integral membrane protein, termed P-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Selkoe, D. Physiol. Rev. 2001,81,741-766; Wolfe, M. J. Med. Chem. 2001,44,2039-2060). pAPP is normally produced by many cells both in vivo and in cultured cells, derived from various animals and humans. Several proteolytic fragments of APP are generated by proteinases referred to as secretases. A subset of these proteolytic fragments, designated p-amyloid peptide (Ap), contains 39 to 43 ammo acids and is generated by the combined action of P-secretase and y-secretase. p-secretase is a membrane-bound, aspartyl protease<br><br>
that forms the N-tenninus of the Ap peptide. The C-terminus of the A|3 peptide is formed by y-secretase, an apparently oligomeric complex that includes presenilin-1 and/or presenilin-2. Presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 are polytopic membrane-spanning proteins that may contain the catalytic components of y-secretase (Seiffert, D.; Bradley, J. et al. /. Biol Chem. 2000,275,34086-34091).<br>
Multiple lines of evidence together strongly suggest that a reduction in brain Ap levels will prevent the onset and progression of AD. First, Ap is a major constituent of the parenchemyal plaques observed in all AD patients and the cerebral vasculature amyloid deposits observed in 90% AD patients (reviewed in Selkoe, D. Physiol. Rev. 2001,81,741-766; Wolfe, M. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44,2039-2060). These plaques are formed from the aggregation of soluble Ap whose brain levels are highly correlated with the severity of AD neurodegeneration (McLean, C., Cherny, R. et al. Ann. Neurol. 1999,46,860-866). Second, mutations in three genes (APP, PS-1, or PS-2) that increase Ap cause familial AD (FAD), where AD onset is accelerated by at least a decade. Included in the mutations that increase Ap are chromosome 21 Trisomy that causes Down's syndrome. Third, transgenic mice that express one or more of the mutant FAD genes have increased Ap levels, form parenchymal plaques and cerebral vascular deposits containing Ap, exhibit memory deficits (Chapman, P.; White, G. et al. Nature Neurosci. 1999,2,271-276) and enhance neurofibrillary degeneration in mice that also overexpress mutant tau (Lewis, J.; Dickson, D. et al. Science 2001,293,1487-1491). Fourth, Ap is toxic to cultured cells (Dahlgren, K.; Manelli, A. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277, 32046-32053), induces neurofibrillary tangles in mice with mutant tau (Gotz, J., Chen, F. et al. Science 2001,293,1491-1495) and interferes with long-term potentiation, a likely component of memory (Walsh, D., Klyubin, I. et al. Nature 2002,416,535-539 and references therein). Taken together, these data lead one skilled in the art to conclude that excess AP production and/or reduced AP clearance cause AD. From mis it follows that reducing brain Ap levels by inhibition of y-secretase will prevent the onset and progression of AD.<br><br>
In addition to AD, excess production and/or reduced clearance o causes cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (reviewed in Thai, D., Gherbremedhin, E. et al. J. Neuropath. Exp. Neuro. 2002, 61,282-293). In these patients, vascular amyloid deposits cause degeneration of vessel walls and aneurysms that may be responsible for 10-15% hemorrhagic strokes in elderly patients. As in AD, mutations in the gene encoding AP lead to an early onset form of CAA, referred to as cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type, and mice expressing this mutant protein develop CAA that is similar to patients.<br>
It is hypothesized that inhibiting the production of AP will prevent and reduce neurological degeneration, reducing neurotoxicity and, generally, mediating the pathology associated with Ap production. Methods of treatment could target the formation of AP through the enzymes involved in the proteolytic processing of p-amyloid precursor protein. Compounds that inhibit P- or y-secretase activity, either directly or indirectly, could control the production of Ap. Advantageously, compounds that specifically target y-secretases, could control the production of Ap. Such inhibition of P- or y-secretases could thereby reduce production of Ap which, could reduce or prevent the neurological disorders associated with Ap protein.<br>
Smith, etal. in International Application WO 00/50391, published August 31,2000, disclose a series of sulfonamide compounds that can act to modulate production of amyloid P protein as a means of treating a variety of diseases, especially Alzheimer's Disease and other diseases relating to the deposition of amyloid. Japanese Patent No.l 1343279, published December 14,1999 discloses a series of sulfonamide derivatives which are TNF-alpha inhbitors useful for treating autoimmune diseases.<br>
Nothing in these references can be construed to disclose or suggest the novel compounds of this invention and their use to inhibit p-AP production.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A series of a-(N-sulfonamido)acetamide derivatives have been synthesized. These compounds specifically inhibit the production of p-amyloid peptide (P-AP) from B-amyloid precursor protein (p-APP). The phannacologic action of these compounds makes them useful for treating conditions responsive to the inhibition of P-AP in a patient; e.g., Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Down's Syndrome. Therapy utilizing administration of these compounds to patients suffering from, or susceptible to, these conditions involves reducing P-AP available for accumulation and deposition in brains of these patients.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention comprises compounds of Formula I, their pharmaceutical formulations, and their use in inhibiting P-AP production in patients suffering from or susceptible to AD or other disorders resulting from P-AP accumulation in brain tissue. The compounds of Formula I which include nontoxic pharmaceuticalry acceptable salts and/or hydrates thereof have the following formula and meanings:<br>

General Reaction Schemes<br>
The general procedures used to synthesize the compounds of Formula I are described in Reaction Schemes 1-23. Reasonable variations of the described<br><br>
procedures, which would be evident to one skilled in the art, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The starting (a-amino)acetamides of Formula II are used in racemic or in enantiomerically pure form and are commercially available or are prepared by well-known literature procedures from commercially available (a-amino)acids (general reference for amide preparation.: R.C. Larock "Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, pp. 972 - 976; see also Reaction Scheme 18 for the conversion of the acid of Formula XLVHf to the amide of Formula XLJX). The compound of Formula n is treated with a suitable base and a sulfonylating reagent such as a sulfonyl chloride in an aprotic solvent such as CH2C12 at room temperature to generate the (a-sulfonarnido)acetamide of Formula in. Suitable bases include triethylamine arid pyridine.<br>
In one method for conversion of the compound of Formula HI to the sulfonamide of Formula I, the compound of Formula in is treated with a suitable base and an alkylating agent in an aprotic solvent with or without heating. Suitable bases for this reaction include potassium carbonate and cesium carbonate. Alkylating agents include alkyl halides (e.g., alkyl chloride, alkyl bromide, or alkyl iodide) and alkyl sulfonates (tosylates, mesylates, trifluoromethanesulfonates). Preferred solvents include DMF and acetonitrile. The temperature range for the reaction is typically 20 °C to 100 °C.<br>
An alternative method for conversion of the compound of Formula HI to the compound of Formula I involves treatment of the compound of Formula HI<br><br>
with triphenyl phosphine, a dialkyl a2X&gt;dicarboxylate, and an alcohol in an inert solvent with or without heating.<br>
Reaction Scheme 1-solid support<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compounds of Formula I can also be prepared using solid phase methodology. For example, FMOC-protected Rink amide resin is treated with piperidine in DMF to effect removal of the FMOC group. The resin is then coupled with an amino-protected (oc-amino)acid in the presence of a coupling agent such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and a dialkyl carbodiimide in an inert solvent such as DMF with or without heating.  Deprotection of the a-amino group affords the polymer-bound amide of Formula IV. In the case of an FMOC-protected amino acid, the deprotection can be accomplished by treatment with piperidine in DMF.<br>
Reaction of the compound of Formula IV with an appropriate base such as pyridine and a sulfonylating agent such as a sulfonyl chloride in an inert solvent provides the resin-linked sulfonamide of Formula V. Alkylation of the compound of Formula V with an alkyl halide (e.g., alkyl chloride, alkyl bromide, or alkyl iodide) or alkyl sulfonate (e.g., mesylate, tosylate, or lifluoromethanesulfonate) is carried out in the presence of a base in an inert solvent at room temperature. A preferred base is 2-/-butylimrno-2-die&amp;ylarnino-lJ3-dimethylperhydro-l,3^2-diasaphosphorine. Cleavage from the resin provides he sulfonamide of Formula I. In the case of the Rink amide resin, the cleavage is referably carried out using trifluoroacetic acid in an inert solvent such as<br><br>
Reaction Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compounds of Foimula I can also be prepared as shown in Reaction Scheme 2. Reductive alkylation of the amine of Formula I to provide the amine of Formula VI is effected by treatment with an aldehyde and a hydride reducing agent in the presence of an acid catalyst with or without heating.

BIOLOGICAL TESTING METHODS<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) are expected to possess y-secretase inhibitory activity. The detection of y-secretase activity requires assays capable of reliable, accurate and expedient detection of y-secretase cleavage products, particularly Ap. The y-secretase inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention is demonstrated using assays for such activity, for example, using the assays described below. Compounds within the scope of the present invention have been shown to inhibit the activity of y-secretase, as determined using assays for such activity.<br>
Compounds provided by this invention should also be useful as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical to inhibit Ap production. These would be provided in commercial kits comprising a compound of this invention.<br>
In vitro binding assay to identify y-secretase inhibitors.<br>
Competitive binding assays can be used to identify molecules that inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled y-secretase inhibitor and therefore inhibit y-secretase activity. For example, [3H]-Compound A can be used for binding assays with membranes from THP-1 cells (Seiffert, D.; Bradley, J. et al., J. Biol Chem. 2000,275,34086-34091). Compound A is (2R.3S) Nl-[(3S)-hexahydro-l-(3-phenoxybenzyl)-2-oxo-lH-azepm-3-yl]-2-(2-methylpropyl)-3-(propyl)-butanediamide, the synthesis of which is described in U.S. patent US6331408 (12/18/2001); PCT Publication WO 00/28331; PCT Publication WO 00/07995; and Seiffert, D., Bradley, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000,275.34086-34091.<br>

For these assays, THP-1 cells were grown in spinner cultures in RPMI 1640 containing L-glutamine and 10 uM p-mercaptoethanol to a density of 5 x 10s cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were quick frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at - 70 °C prior to use. The pellets of approximately 2 x 10^ THP-1 cells were homogenized using a Brinkman Polytron at setting 6 for 10 sec. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 12 min, and the resulting pellet was washed by repeating the homogenization<br><br>
and centrifugation. The final cell pellet was resuspended in buffer to yield a protein concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/ml. Assays were initiated by the addition of 150 pi of membrane suspension to 150 jil of assay buffer containing 0.064 nCi of radioligand and various concentrations of unlabeled compounds. Binding assays were performed in duplicate in polypropylene 96-well plates in a final volume of 0.3 ml containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Nonspecific binding was defined using incubations with 300 nM compound A (Seiffert, D., Bradley, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275,34086-34091). After incubating at 23 °C for 1.3 hr, bound ligand was separated from free radioligand by filtration over OFF glass fiber filters presoaked in 0.3% ethyleneimine polymer solution. Filters were washed three times with 0.3 ml of ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Filter-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. ICSO values were then determined and used to calculate Kj values using the Cheng-Prusoft<br>
correction for IC50 values. Compounds were scored as active y-secretase inhibitors if Ki values were less than 10 |oM.<br>
Examples of the results obtained when the invention compounds are subjected to the above described assay are shown in Table 1. In the table, an inhibitory concentration (ICSO) of less than or equal to 50 nM is represented by ; between 50 nM and 500 nM by ++; between 500 nM and 10000 nM by +.<br>

In vitro assay to identify y-secretase inhibitor based on the inhibition of Aft formation from membrane preparations.<br>
An isolated membrane fraction which contains functionally active y-secretase and P-APP substrates can generate y-secretase cleavage products including Ap (Roberts, S.B.; Hendrick, J. P.; Vinitsky, A.; Lewis, M.; Smith, D.W.; Pak, R. PCX Publication WO 01/0175435; Fechteler, K.; Kostka, M.; Fuchs, M. Patent Apph'cation No. DE 99-19941039; Shearman, M.; Beher, D. et al., Biochemistry, 2000,39, 8698-8704; Zhang, L. Song, L. et al., Biochemistry 2001,40, 5049-5055). An isolated membrane fraction can be prepared from human derived cell lines such as HeLa and H4 which have been transfected with wild type or mutant forms of p-APP or a human alkaline phosphatase P-APP fusion construct, and stably express high levels of y-secretase substrates. The endogenous y-secretase present in the isolated membranes prepared at 0-4 °C cleaves the p-APP substrates when the membranes are shifted from 0-4 to 37 °C. Detection of the cleavage products including Ap can be monitored by standard techniques such as immunoprecipitation (Citron, M.; Diehl, T.S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1996,93,13170-13175), western blot (Klafki, H.-W.; Ambramowski, D. et al., J. Biol Chem.. 1996,271,28655-28659), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA ) as demonstrated by Seubert, P.; Vigo-Pelfrey, C. et al., Nature, 1992,359,325-327, or by a preferred method using ime-resolved fluorescence of the homogeneous sample containing membranes rad Ap (Roberts, S.B.; Hendrick, J. P.; Vinitsky, A.; Lewis, M.; Smith, D.W.; 'ak, R. PCT Publication WO 01/0175435; Shearman, M.; Beher, D. et al., biochemistry, 2000,39, 8698-8704). The Ap present in a homogeneous sample :ontaining membranes can be detected by time-resolved fluorescence with two ntibodies that recognize different epitopes of Ap. One of the antibodies<br>
recognizes an epitope that is present in Ap but not present in the precursor fragments; preferably the antibody binds the carboxyl terminus of Ap generated by the y-secretase cleavage. The second antibody binds to any other epitope present on Ap. For example, antibodies that bind the N-terminal region (e.g., 26D6-B2-B3 ® SIBIA Neurosciences, La Jolla, CA) or bind the C-terminal end (e.g., 9S3.2 ® antibody, Biosolutions, Newark, DE) of the Ap peptide are known. The antibodies are labeled with a pair of fluorescent adducts that transfer fluorescent energy when the adducts are brought in close proximity as a result of binding to the N- and C-terminal ends or regions of Ap. A lack of fluorescence is indicative of the absence of cleavage products, resulting from inhibition of y-secretase. The isolated membrane assay can be used to identify candidate agents that inhibit the activity, of y-secretase cleavage and Ap production.<br>
A typical membrane-based assay requires 45 ug membrane protein per well in a 96- or 3 84-well format. Membranes in a neutral buffer are combined with the test compound and shifted- from 0-4 to 37 °C. Test agents may typically consist of synthetic compounds, secondary metabolites from bacterial or fungal fermentation extracts, or extracts from plant or marine samples. All synthetic agents are initially screened at doses ranging from 10-100 uM or in the case of extracts at sufficient dilution to minimize cytotoxicity. Incubation of the membranes with the test agent will continue for approximately 90 minutes at which time fluorescence labeled antibodies are added to each well for Ap quantitation. The time-resolved fluorescence detection and quantitation of Ap is described elsewhere (Roberts, S.B.; Hendrick, J. P.; Vinitsky, A.; Lewis, M.; Smith, D.W.; Pak, R PCT Publication WO 01/0175435; Shearman, M.; Beher, D. et al., Biochemistry, 2000. 39, 8698-8704). Results are obtained by analysis of the plate in a fluorescence plate reader and comparison to the mock treated membranes and samples in which known amounts of Ap were added to construct a standard concentration curve. A positive acting compound is one that inhibits the Ap relative to the control sample by at least 50% at the initial tested concentration. If a compound is found to be active then a dose response<br>
experiment is performed to determine the lowest dose of compound necessary to elicit the inhibition of the production of Ap. Compounds were scored as active y-secretase inhibitors if Kf values were less than 10 pM.<br>
Examples of the results obtained when the invention compounds are subjected to the above described assay are shown in Table 2. In the table, an inhibitory concentration (ICSO) of less than or equal to 50 nM is represented by ; between 50 nM and 500 nM by -H-; between 500 nM and 10000 nM by -K<br>

In vitro assays to identify y-secretase inhibitor based on the inhibition of Aft formation in cultured cells.<br>
Cultured human cell lines, such as HEK293 and H4 cells, which express APP and y-secretase activity or transfected derivative cell lines that overexpress<br>
wild-type APP, mutant APP, or APP fusion proteins will secrete Ap peptides into the culture media that can be quantified as previously outlined (Dovey, H., John, V. et al., J. Neurochem. 2001, 76,173-181). The incubation of these cultured cells with y-secretase inhibitors decreases the production of AP peptides. For instance, H4 cells stably transfected to overexpress the HPLAP-APP fusion protein described above were grown as above, detached, and adjusted to 2 x 10^ cells/ml. 100 ul of the resulting suspension was then added to each well of a 96-well plate. After 4 hrs, the media was removed and replaced with 100 jj.1 serum-free media containing various dilutions of the test compound. Plates were then incubated for 18 hrs at 37 °C and a 100 pi aliquot of the tissue culture supernatant was removed for determination of AP levels using time-resolved fluorescence of the homogenous sample as outlined above. Alternately, the other methods described above for AP determination could be used. The extent of AP inhibition was used to calculate the ICSO value for the test compound. Compounds of the present invention are considered active when tested in the above assay if the IC50 value for the test compound is less than 50 uM.<br>
Examples of the results obtained when the invention compounds are subjected to the above described assay are shown in Table 3. In the table, an inhibitory concentration (ICSO) of less than or equal to 50 nM is represented by (-; between 50 nM and 500 nM by ++; between 500 nM and 50000 nM by +.<br>

Compounds of the present invention have been demonstrated to have an IC50 value less than 10 uM in one or all of the above assays. Therefore, the compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful in the treatment, alleviation or elimination of disorders or other disorders associated with the inhibition of |}-amyloid peptide.<br>
In addition to cleaving APP, y-secretase cleaves other substrates, including: the Notch family of transmembrane receptors (reviewed in: Selkoe, D. Physiol Rev. 2001, 81,741-766; Wolfe, M. J. Med. Chem. 2001 44,2039-2060); LDL receptor-related protein (May, P., Reddy, Y.K., Herz, J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002,277,18736-18743); ErbB-4 (Ni, C.Y., Murphy, M.P., Golde, T.E., Carpenter, G. Science 2001,294,2179-2181); E-cadherin (Marambaud, P., Shioi, J., et al., EMBOJ. 2002,21,1948-1956); and CD44 (Okamoto, L, Kawano, Y., et al., /. Cell Biol 2001,155, 755-762). If inhibition of cleavage of non-APP substrates causes undesirable effects in humans, then desired y-secretase inhibitors would preferentially inhibit APP cleavage relative to unwanted substrates. Notch cleavage can be monitored directly by measuring the amount of cleavage product or indirectly by measuring the effect of the cleavage product on<br>

In vivo assays for the determination of Aft reduction bv Y-secretase inhibitors. In vivo assays are available to demonstrate the inhibition of y-secretase activity. In these assays, animals, such as mice, that express normal levels of APP and y-secretase or are engineered to express higher levels of APP and hence Ap can be used to demonstrate the utility of y-secretase inhibitors (Dovey, H., John, V., et al., J. Neurochem. 2001, 76,173-181). In these assays, y-secretase inhibitors were administered to animals and Ap levels in multiple compartments, such as plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain extracts, were monitored for AP levels using methods previously outlined. For instance, Tg2576 mice, which overexpress human APP, was administered y-secretase inhibitors by oral gavage at doses that will cause measurable AP lowering, typically less than 100 mg/kg. Three hours after dosing plasma, brain, and CSF were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at —80 °C until analysis. For AP detection, plasma was diluted 15-fold in PBS with 0.1% Chaps while CSF was diluted 15-fold in 1% Chaps with protease inhibitors (5 ug/ml leupeptin, 30 fig/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenyhnethylsulfonylfluoride, 1 uM pepstatin). Brains were homogenized in 1% Chaps with protease inhibitors using 24 ml solution/g brain tissue. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr at 4 °C. The resulting supematants were then diluted 10-fold in 1% Chaps with protease inhibitors. AP levels in the plasma, CSF, and brain lysate were measured using time-resolved fluorescence of the homogenous sample or one of the other methods previously described. A y-secretase inhibitor is considered active in one of the above in vivo assays if it reduces Ap by at least 50% at a dosage of 100 mg/kg.<br>
Therefore, the compounds of Formula I or pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful in the treatment, alleviation or elimination of disorders or other disorders associated with the inhibition of p-amyloid peptide.<br>
In another embodiment, this invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I in combination with a pharmaceutical adjuvant, carrier or diluent.<br>
In still another embodiment, this invention relates to a method of treatment or prevention of disorders responsive to the inhibition of p-amyloid peptide in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment, this invention relates to a method for treating Alzheimer's Disease and Down's Syndrome in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate thereof.<br>
For therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds of Formula I will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants and excipients employing standard and conventional techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions include suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous) bronchial or nasal administration. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The solid carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tableting lubricants, disLntegrants, wetting agents and the like. The tablet may, if desired, be film coated by conventional techniques. If a liquid carrier is employed, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying<br>
agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils), preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents. For parenteral administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part, although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized. Injectable suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may be employed. Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like also may be added to the parenteral dosage forms. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques appropriate to the desired preparation containing appropriate amounts of the active ingredient, ihat is, the compound of Formula I according to the invention. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 17th edition, 1985.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of Formula I to achieve a therapeutic effect will depend not only on such factors as the age, weight and sex of the patient and mode of administration, but also on the degree of p-AP inhibition desired and the potency of the particular compound being utilized for the particular disorder of disease concerned. It is also contemplated that the treatment and dosage of the particular compound may be administered in unit dosage form and that the unit dosage form would be adjusted accordingly by one skilled in the art to reflect the relative level of activity. The decision as to the particular dosage to be employed (and the number of times to be administered per day) is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
A suitable dose of a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutical composition thereof for a mammal, including man, suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition related to P-AP production as described herein, generally the daily dose will be from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg and preferably, about 0.1 to 2 mg/kg when administered parenterally. For oral administration, the dose may be in the range from about 1 to about 75 mg/kg and preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight. The active ingredient will preferably be administered in equal doses from one to four times a day. However, usually a small dosage is administered, and the dosage is gradually<br>
increased until the optimal dosage for the host under treatment is determined. In accordance with good clinical practice, it is preferred to administer the instant compounds at a concentration level that will produce an effective anti-amyloid effect without causing any harmful or untoward side effects. However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound of be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
