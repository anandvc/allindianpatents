The present invention relates to a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.<br>
The present invention relates to substituted pyrimidine derivatives. In particular, the invention relates to [4-(3-substituted-phenyl)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-phenyl-amines and [4-(3-substituted-phenyl)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-(pyridine-3-yl)-amines and their use in therapy. More specifically, but not exclusively, the invention relates to compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more protein kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
In eukaryotes, all biological functions, including DNA replication, cell cycle progression, energy metabolism, and cell growth and differentiation, are regulated through the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. The phosphorylation state of a protein determines not only its function, subcellular distribution, and stability, but also what other proteins or cellular components it associates with. The balance of specific phosphorylation in the proteome as a whole, as well as of individual members in a biochemical pathway, is thus used by organisms as a strategy to maintain homeostasis in response to an ever-changing environment. The enzymes that carry out these phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps are protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively.<br>
The eukaryotic protein kinase family is one of the largest in the human genome, comprising some 500 genes [1,2]. The majority of kinases contain a 250-300 amino acid residue catalytic domain with a conserved core structure. This domain comprises a blading pocket for ATP (less frequently GTP), whose terminal phosphate group the kinase transfers covalently to its macromolecular substrates. The phosphate donor is always bound as a complex with a divalent ion (usually Mg2+or Mn2+). Another important function of the catalytic domain is the binding and orientation for phosphotransfer of the macromolecular substrate. The catalytic domains present in most kinases are more or less homologous.<br><br>
A wide variety of molecules capable of inhibiting protein kinase function through<br>
antagonising ATP binding are known in the art [3-7]. By way of example, the applicant has<br>
previously disclosed 2-anihno^-heteroaryl-pyrimidine compounds with kinase inhibitory<br>
properties, particularly against cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [8-12]. CDKs are<br>
serine/threonine protein kinases that associate with various cyclin subunits. These<br>
complexes are important for the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle progression, but also<br>
for the regulation of transcription [13,14].<br>
The present invention seeks to provide [4-(3-substituted-phenyl)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-phenylamines<br>
and [4-(3-substituted-phenyl)-pyrmii6^-2-yl]-(pyridine-3-yl)-amines. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to compounds that have broad therapeutic applications in<br>
the treatment of a number of different diseases and/or that are capable of inhibiting one or<br>
more protein kinases.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl" refers to a group comprising at least C and H. If the<br>
hydrocarbyl group comprises more than one C then those carbons need not necessarily be<br>
linked to each other. For example, at least two of the carbons may be linked via a suitable<br>
element or group. Thus, the hydrocarbyl group may contain heteroatoms. Suitable<br>
heteroatoms will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include, for instance, sulphur,<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and silicon. Where the hydrocarbyl group contains one or<br>
more heteroatoms, the group may be linked via a carbon atom or via a heteroatom to<br>
another group, i.e. the linker atom may be a carbon or a heteroatom. Preferably, the<br>
hydrocarbyl group is an aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, alicyclic, heteroalicyclic<br>
or alkenyl group. More preferably, the hydrocarbyl group is an aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aralkyl or alkenyl group. The hydrocarbyl group may be optionally substituted<br>
by one or more R11 groups.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkyl" includes both saturated straight chain and branched alkyl<br>
groups which may be substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted. Preferably, the alkyl<br>
group is a €1-20 alkyl group, more preferably a CMS, more preferably still a CMZ alkyl<br>
group, more preferably still, a Ci-e alkyl group, more preferably a Ci-3 alkyl group.<br>
Particularly preferred alkyl groups include, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,<br>
butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl. Suitable substituents include, for example,<br>
one or more R11 groups. Preferably, the alkyl group is unsubstituted.<br>
As used herein, the term "cycloalkyl" refers to a cyclic alkyl group which may be<br>
substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted. Preferably, the cycloalkyl group is a €3-12<br>
cycloalkyl group. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more Rn groups.<br>
As used herein, the term "alkenyl" refers to a group containing one or more carbon-carbon<br>
double bonds, which may be branched or unbranched, substituted (mono- or poly-) or<br>
unsubstituted. Preferably the alkenyl group is a 02-20 alkenyl group, more preferably a C2.<br>
15 alkenyl group, more preferably still a Cz-iz alkenyl group, or preferably a C2-6 alkenyl<br>
group, more preferably a €2-3 alkenyl group. Suitable substituents include, for example,<br>
one or more R11 groups as defined above.<br>
As used herein, the term "aryl" refers to a €5-12 aromatic group which may be substituted<br>
(mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted. Typical examples include phenyl and naphthyl etc.<br>
Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more Ru groups.<br>
As used herein, the term "heteroaryl" refers to a Ca-n aromatic, substituted (mono- or poly-<br>
) or unsubstituted group, which comprises one or more heteroatoms. Preferably, the<br>
heteroaryl group is a €4.12 aromatic group comprising one or more heteroatoms selected<br>
from N, O and S. Suitable heteroaryl groups include pyrrole, pyrazole, pyrimidine,<br>
pyrazine, pyridine, quinoline, thiophene, 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, thiazole, oxazole,<br>
iso-thiazole, iso-oxazole, imidazole, furan and the like. Again, suitable substituents<br>
include, for example, one or more R11 groups.<br>
As used herein, the term "alicyclic" refers to a cyclic aliphatic group which optionally<br>
contains one or more heteroatoms. Preferred alicyclic groups include piperidinyl,<br>
pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl and morpholino. More preferably, the alicyclic group is selected<br>
from N-piperidinyl, N-pyrrolidinyl, N-piperazinyl and N-morpholino<br>
As used herein, the term "aralkyl" includes, but is not limited to, a group having both aryl<br>
and alkyl functionalities. By way of example, the term includes groups in which one of the<br>
hydrogen atoms of the alkyl group is replaced by an aryl group, e.g. a phenyl group<br>
optionally having one or more substituents such as halo, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, and the<br>
like. Typical aralkyl groups include benzyl, phenethyl and the like.<br>

THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
The compounds of the present invention have been found to possess anti-proliferative<br>
activity and are therefore believed to be of use in the treatment of proliferative disorders<br>
such as cancers, leukaemias and other disorders associated with uncontrolled cellular<br>
proliferation such as psoriasis and restenosis. As defined herein, an anti-proliferative effect<br>
within the scope of the present invention may be demonstrated by the ability to inhibit cell<br>
proliferation in an in vitro whole cell assay, for example using any of the cell lines A549,<br>
HT29 or Saos-2 Using such assays it may be determined whether a compound is antiproliferative<br>
in the context of the present invention.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the present invention therefore relates to the use of one or<br>
more compounds of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for treating a<br>
proliferative disorder.<br>
As used herein the phrase "preparation of a medicament" includes the use of a compound<br>
of the invention directly as the medicament in addition to its use in a screening programme<br>
for further therapeutic agents or in any stage of the manufacture of such a medicament.<br>
Preferably, the proliferative disorder is a cancer or leukaemia. The term proliferative<br>
disorder is used herein in a broad sense to include any disorder that requires control of the<br>
cell cycle, for example cardiovascular disorders such as restenosis, cardiomyopathy and<br>
myocardial infarction, auto-immune disorders such as glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal,<br>
antiparasitic disorders such as malaria, emphysema, alopecia, and chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disorder. In these disorders, the compounds of the present invention may<br>
induce apoptosis or maintain stasis within the desired cells as required.<br>
The compounds of the invention may inhibit any of the steps or stages in the cell cycle, for<br>
example, formation of the nuclear envelope, exit from the quiescent phase of the cell cycle<br>
(GO), Gl progression, chromosome decondensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, START,<br>
initiation of DNA replication, progression of DNA replication, termination of DNA<br>
replication, centrosome duplication, G2 progression, activation of mitotic or meiotic<br>
functions, chromosome condensation, centrosome separation, microtubule nucleation,<br>
spindle formation and function, interactions with microtubule motor proteins, chromatid<br>
separation and segregation, inactivation of mitotic functions, formation of contractile ring,<br>
and cytokinesis functions. In particular, the compounds of the invention may influence<br>
certain gene functions such as chrornatin binding, formation of replication complexes,<br>
replication licensing, phosphorylation or other secondary modification activity, proteolytic<br>
degradation, microtubule binding, actin binding, septin binding, microtubule organising<br>
centre nucleation activity and binding to components of cell cycle signalling pathways.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is administered in an<br>
amount sufficient to inhibit at least one CDK enzyme.<br>
Preferably, the compound of the invention is administered in an amount sufficient to<br>
inhibit at least one of CDK2 and/or CDK4.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for treating a viral disorder, such as human cytomegalovirus<br>
(HCMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1<br>
(HTV-1), and varicella zoster virus (VZV).<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is<br>
administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit one or more of the host cell CDKs involved<br>
in viral replication, i.e. CDK2, CDK7, CDKS, and CDK9 [23].<br>
As defined herein, an anti-viral effect within the scope of the present invention may be<br>
demonstrated by the ability to inhibit CDK2, CDK7, CDKS or CDK9.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention relates to the use of one or more<br>
compounds of the invention in the treatment of a viral disorder which is CDK dependent or<br>
sensitive. CDK dependent disorders are associated with an above normal level of activity<br>
of one or more CDK enzymes. Such disorders preferably associated with an abnormal<br>
level of activity of CDK2, CDK7, CDK8 and/or CDK9. A CDK sensitive disorder is a<br>
disorder in which an aberration in the CDK level is not the primary cause, but is<br>
downstream of the primary metabolic aberration. In such scenarios, CDK2, CDK7, CDK8<br>
and/or CDK9 can be said to be part of the sensitive metabolic pathway and CDK inhibitors<br>
may therefore be active in treating such disorders.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a CDK-dependent disorder,<br>
said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a compound according<br>
to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above in an<br>
amount sufficient to inhibit a cyclin dependent kinase.<br>
Preferably, the CDK-dependent disorder is a viral disorder or a proliferative disorder, more<br>
preferably cancer.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of the invention, or<br>
pharmaceutically accetable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating<br>
diabetes.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the diabetes is type n diabetes.<br>
GSK3 is one of several protein kinases that phosphorylate glycogen synthase (GS). The<br>
stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in skeletal muscle results from the<br>
dephosphorylation and activation of GS. GSKS's action on GS thus results in the latter's<br>
deactivation and thus suppression of the conversion of glucose into glycogen in muscles.<br>
Type n diabetes (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus) is a multi-factorial disease.<br>
Hyperglycaemia is due to insulin resistance in the liver, muscles, and other tissues, coupled<br>
with impaired secretion of insulin. Skeletal muscle is the main site for insulin-stimulated<br>
glucose uptake, there it is either removed from circulation or converted to glycogen.<br>
Muscle glycogen deposition is the main determinant in glucose homeostasis and type n<br>
diabetics have defective muscle glycogen storage. There is evidence that an increase in<br>
GSK3 activity is important in type II diabetes [24]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated<br>
that GSK3 is over-expressed in muscle cells of type n diabetics and that an inverse<br>
correlation exists between skeletal muscle GSK3 activity and insulin action [25].<br>
GSK3 inhibition is therefore of therapeutic significance in the treatment of diabetes,<br>
particularly type II, and diabetic neuropathy.<br>
It is notable that GSK3 is known to phosphorylate many substrates other than GS, and is<br>
thus involved in the regulation of multiple biochemical pathways. For example, GSK is<br>
highly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems.<br>
Preferably, the compound is administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit GSK, more<br>
preferably GSK3, more preferably still GSK30.<br>
Another aspect of the invention therefore relates to the use of compounds of the invention,<br>
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for<br>
treating a CNS disorders, for example neurodegenerative disorders.<br>
Preferably, the CNS disorder is Alzheimer's disease. Tau is a GSK-3 substrate which has been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In healthy nerve cells, Tau co-assembles with tubulin into microtubules. However, in<br>
Alzheimer's disease, tau forms large tangles of filaments, which disrupt the microtubule<br>
structures in the nerve cell, thereby impairing the transport of nutrients as well as the<br>
transmission of neuronal messages.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that GSK3 inhibitors may be able to<br>
prevent and/or reverse the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated<br>
protein tau that is an invariant feature of Alzheimer's disease and a number of other<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal<br>
degeneration and Pick's disease. Mutations in the tau gene cause inherited forms of frontotemporal<br>
dementia, further underscoring the relevance of tau protein dysfunction for the<br>
neurodegenerative process [26].<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of the invention, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating<br>
bipolar disorder.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of the invention, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating a<br>
stroke.<br>
Reducing neuronal apoptosis is an important therapeutic goal in the context of head<br>
trauma, stroke, epilepsy, and motor neuron disease [27]. Therefore, GSK3 as a proapoptotic<br>
factor in neuronal cells makes this protein kinase an attractive therapeutic target<br>
for the design of inhibitory drugs to treat these diseases.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of compounds of the invention, or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for treating<br>
alopecia. '"<br>
Hair growth is controlled by the Wnt signalling pathway, in particular Wnt-3. In tissueculture<br>
model systems of the skin, the expression of non-degradable mutants of p-catenin<br>
leads to a dramatic increase in the population of putative stem cells, which have greater<br>
proliferative potential [28]. This population of stem cells expresses a higher level of noncadherin-<br>
associated p-catenin [29], which may contribute to their high proliferative<br>
potential. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing a truncated p-catenin in the skin<br>
undergo de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, which normally is only established during<br>
embryogenesis. The ectopic application of GSK3 inhibitors may therefore be<br>
therapeutically useful in the treatment of baldness and in restoring hair growth following<br>
chemotherapy-induced, alopecia.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a GSK3-dependent<br>
disorder, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a compound<br>
according to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above<br>
in an amount sufficient to inhibit GSK3.<br>
Preferably, the GSK3-dependent disorder is diabetes.<br>
Preferably, the compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is<br>
administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit GSK3j3.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is administered in an<br>
amount sufficient to inhibit at least one PLK enzyme.<br>
The polo-Eke khiases (PLKs) constitute a family of serine/threorune protein kinases.<br>
Mitotic Drosophila melanogaster mutants at the polo locus display spindle abnormalities<br>
[30] and polo was found to encode a mitotic kinase [31]. In humans, there exist three<br>
closely related PLKs [32]. They contain a highly homologous amino-terrninal catalytic<br>
kinase domain and their carboxyl termini contain two or three conserved regions, the polo<br>
boxes. The function of the polo boxes remains incompletely understood but they are<br>
implicated in the targeting of PLKs to subcellular compartments [33,34], mediation of<br>
interactions with other proteins [35], or may constitute part of an autoregulatory domain<br>
[36]. Furthermore, the polo box-dependent PLK1 activity is required for proper<br>
metaphase/anaphase transition and cytokinesis [37,38].<br>
Studies have shown that human PLKs regulate some fundamental aspects of mitosis<br>
[39,40]. In particular, PLK1 activity is believed to be necessary for the functional<br>
maturation of centrosomes in late G2/early prophase and subsequent establishment of a<br>
bipolar spindle. Depletion of cellular PLK1 through the small interfering RNA (siRNA)<br>
technique has also confirmed that this protein is required for multiple mitotic processes and<br>
completion of cytokinesis [41].<br>
In a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of the invention is<br>
administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit PLK1.<br>
Of the three human PLKs, PLK1 is the best characterized; it regulates a number of cell<br>
division cycle effects, including the onset of mitosis [42,43], DNA-damage checkpoint<br>
activation [44,45], regulation of the anaphase promoting complex [46-48], phosphorylation<br>
of the proteasome [49], and centrosome duplication and maturation [50].<br>
Specifically, initiation of mitosis requires activation of M-phase promoting factor (MPF),<br>
the complex between the cyclin dependent kinase CDK1 and B-type cyclins [51]. The<br>
latter accumulate during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and promote the inhibitory<br>
phosphorylation of the MPF complex by WEE1, MIK1, and MYT1 kinases. At the end of<br>
the G2 phase, corresponding dephosphorylation by the dual-specificity phosphatase<br>
CDC25C triggers the activation of MPF [52]. In interphase, cyclin B localizes to the<br>
cytoplasm [53], it then becomes phosphorylated during prophase and this event causes<br>
nuclear translocation [54,55]. The nuclear accumulation of active MPF during prophase is<br>
thought to be important for initiating M-phase events [56]. However, nuclear MPF is kept<br>
inactive by WEE1 unless counteracted by CDC25C. The phosphatase CDC25C itself,<br>
localized to the cytoplasm during interphase, accumulates in the nucleus in prophase [57-<br>
59]. The nuclear entry of both cyclin B [60] and CDC25C [61] are promoted through<br>
phosphorylation by PLK1 [43]. This kinase is an important regulator of M-phase initiation.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the compounds of the invention are ATPantagonistic<br>
inhibitors of PLK1.<br>
In the present context ATP antagonism refers to the ability of an inhibitor compound to<br>
diminish or prevent PLK catalytic activity, i.e. phosphotransfer from ATP to a<br>
macromolecular PLK substrate, by virtue of reversibly or irreversibly binding at the<br>
enzyme's active site in such a manner as to impair or abolish ATP binding.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is administered in an<br>
amount sufficient to inhibit PLK2 and/or PLK3.<br>
Mammalian PLK2 (also known as SNK) and PLK3 (also known as PRK and FNK) were<br>
originally shown to be immediate early gene products. PLK3 kinase activity appears to<br>
peak during late S and G2 phase. It is also activated during DNA damage checkpoint<br>
activation and severe oxidative stress. PLK3 also plays an important role in the regulation<br>
of microtubule dynamics and centrosome function in the cell and deregulated PLK3<br>
expression results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [62]. PLK2 is the least well understood<br>
homologue of the three PLKs. Both PLK2 and PLK3 may have additional important postmitotic<br>
functions [35].<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a PLK-dependent disorder,<br>
said method comprising administering to a subject hi need thereof, a compound according<br>
to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above in an<br>
amount sufficient to inhibit PLK.<br>
Preferably, the PLK-dependent disorder is a proliferative disorder, more preferably cancer.<br>
Preferably, the compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is<br>
administered in an amount sufficient to inhibit aurora kinase.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating an aurora kinase-dependent<br>
disorder, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a compound<br>
according to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above<br>
in an amount sufficient to inhibit aurora kinase.<br>
Preferably, the aurora kinase dependent disorder is a viral disorder as defined above.<br>

acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers. Even though the compounds of the present<br>
invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in<br>

SALTS/ESTERS<br>
The compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, hi particular<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid<br>
addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in<br>
Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong<br>
inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrohalic<br>
acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms which are unsubstiruted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with<br>
saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic,<br>
fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic,<br>
glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or<br>
glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (Ci-C4)-alkyl- or<br>
aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such<br>
as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
Esters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the<br>
functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as<br>
alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g.,<br>
by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for<br>
example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric<br>
acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or ghitamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with<br>
organic sulfonic acids, such as (Ci-C^-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are<br>
unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene<br>
sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols<br>
include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted,<br>
e.g. by a halogen).<br>
ENANTIOMERS/TAUTOMERS<br>
In all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where<br>
appropriate all enantiomers and tautomers of compounds of the invention. The man skilled<br>
in the art will recognise compounds that possess an optical properties (one or more chiral<br>
carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or<br>
tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
STEREO AND GEOMETRIC ISOMERS<br>
Some of the compounds of the invention may exist* as stereoisomers and/or geometric<br>
isomers - e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so<br>
may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention<br>
contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those<br>
agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms,<br>
provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the<br>
same degree).<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present<br>
invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one hi which at least<br>
one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass<br>
different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be<br>
incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes<br>
of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as<br>
2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36C1, respectively. Certain isotopic<br>
variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in<br>
which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or<br>
substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are<br>
particularly preferred for then: ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution<br>
with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages<br>
resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased hi vivo half-life or<br>
reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic<br>
variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using<br>
appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
SOLVATES<br>
The present invention also includes the use of solvate forms of the compounds of the<br>
present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.<br>
POLYMORPHS<br>
The invention furthermore relates to the compounds of the present invention hi their<br>
various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established<br>
within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of<br>
such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the<br>
solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.<br>
PRODRUGS<br>
The invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form.<br>
Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate<br>
groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon<br>
administration to a human or mammalian subject. Such reversion is usually performed by<br>
an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be<br>
administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo.<br>
Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above),<br>
wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
ADMINISTRATION<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for oral, rectal,<br>
vaginal, parenteral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial,<br>
subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, nasal, buccal or sublingual routes of<br>
administration.<br>
For oral administration, particular use is made of compressed tablets, pills, tablets, gellules,<br>
drops, and capsules. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more<br>
preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.<br>
Other forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected<br>
intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally<br>
or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories,<br>
pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or<br>
dusting powders.<br>
An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example,<br>
the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of<br>
polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a<br>
concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax<br>
or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be<br>
required.<br>
f<br>
Injectable forms may contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of<br>
active ingredient per dose.<br>
Compositions may be formulated in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions<br>
containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose.<br>
DOSAGE<br>
A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the<br>
instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a<br>
physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual<br>
patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the<br>
age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual<br>
undergoing therapy. The^ dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case.<br>
There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are<br>
merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.01 to 30<br>
mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg<br>
body weight.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, one or more doses of 10 to 150 mg/day will be administered<br>
to the patient.<br>
COMBINATIONS<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are<br>
administered in combination with one or more other therapeutically active agents, for<br>
example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the<br>
invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one<br>
or more other active agents.<br>
By way of example, it is known that anticancer drugs in general are more effective when<br>
used in combination.- In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an<br>
overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s).<br>
Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses<br>
with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining<br>
chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects<br>
through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance in<br>
early tumor cells which would have been otherwise responsive to initial chemotherapy<br>
with a single agent. An example of the use of biochemical interactions in selecting drug<br>
combinations is demonstrated by the administration of leucovorin to increase the binding<br>
of an active intracellular metabolite of 5-fluorouracil to its target, thymidylate synthase, '<br>
thus increasing its cytotoxic effects.<br>
Numerous combinations are used in current treatments of cancer and leukemia. A more<br>
extensive review of medical practices may be found in "Oncologic Therapies" edited by E.<br>
E. Yokes and H. M. Golomb, published by Springer.<br>
Beneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the growth inhibitory activity of<br>
the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a<br>
particular cancer initially or cell lines derived from that cancer. This procedure can also be<br>
used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or<br>
after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the cycle acting agents identified<br>
herein.<br>

Example 46<br>
Kinase assays<br>
j<br>
The compounds from the examples ahove were investigated for their ability to inhibit the<br>
enzymatic activity of various protein kinases. This was achieved by measurement of<br>
incorporation of radioactive phosphate from ATP into appropriate polypeptide substrates.<br>
Recombinant protein kinases and kinase complexes were produced or obtained<br>
commercially. Assays were performed using 96-well plates and appropriate assay buffers<br>
 (typically 25 mM p-glycerophosphate, 20 mM MOPS, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM<br>
Na3VO3, pH 7.4), into which were added 2 - 4 jj.g of active enzyme with appropriate<br>
substrates. The reactions were initiated by addition of Mg/ATP mix (15 mM MgCl2 + 100<br>
HM ATP with 30-50 kBq per well of [y-32P]-ATP) and mixtures incubated as required at<br>
30 °C. Reactions were stopped on ice, followed by filtration through p81 filterplates or<br>
GF/C filterplates (Whatman Polyfiltronics, Kent, UK). After washing 3 times with 75 mM<br>
aq orthophosphoric acid, plates were dried, scintillant added and incorporated radioactivity<br>
measured in a scintillation counter (TopCount, Packard Instruments, Pangbourne, Berks,<br>
UK). Compounds for kinase assay were made up as 10 mM stocks in DMSO and diluted<br>
into 10 % DMSO in assay buffer. Data was analysed using curve-fitting software<br>
(GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California<br>
USA) to determine ICso values (concentration of test compound which inhibits kinase<br>
activity by 50 %.). ICso values for selected compounds of the invention are shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
MTT cvtotoxicity assay<br>
The compounds from the examples above were subjected to a standard cellular<br>
proliferation assay using human tumour cell lines obtained from the ATCC (American<br>
Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manessas, VA 20110-2209, USA).<br>
Standard 72-h MTT (thiazolyl blue; 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium<br>
bromide) assays were performed [67, 68]. hi short: cells were seeded into 96-well plates<br>
according to doubling time and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Test compounds were made<br>
up in DMSO and a 1/3 dilution series prepared in 100 uL cell media, added to cells (in<br>
triplicates) and incubated for 72 ho at 37 °C. MTT was made up as a stock of 5 mg/mL in<br>
cell media and filter-sterilised. Media was removed from cells followed by a wash with<br>
200 jjL PBS, MTT solution was then added at 20 uL per well and incubated in the dark at<br>
37 °C for 4 h. MTT solution was removed and cells again washed with 200 uL PBS. MTT<br>
dye was solubilised with 200 jiL per well of DMSO with agitation. Absorbance was read at<br>
540 nm and data analysed using curve-fitting software (GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for<br>
Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA) to determine ICso values<br>
 (concentration of test compound which inhibits cell growth by 50 %). IC50 values for<br>
selected compounds of the invention are shown in Table 2.<br>
Various modifications and variations of the described aspects of the invention will be<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
