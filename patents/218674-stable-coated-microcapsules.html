				<td>STABLE COATED MICROCAPSULES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to microencapsulated compositions of lipophilic<br>
compounds, having improved stability and to a method for preparing said composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Processes for encapsulating oils and oil soluble substances are well known in the art.<br>
US 4,389,419, for example, which is incorporated herein by reference, relates to a<br>
process for encapsulating oils and oil-soluble substances in multi-compartmentalized,<br>
mechanically stable microcapsules. The process comprises the steps of first forming an<br>
emulsion consisting of a continuous phase comprising an aqueous solution of an alkali<br>
metal alginate and optionally a water-soluble, alcohol-insoluble filler such as a<br>
polysaccharide, and a dispersed phase of an oleophilic substance such as one or more<br>
vitamins dissolved in an oil. The emulsion is then formed into droplets which are<br>
thereafter immersed in an alcoholic solution of multivalent cations, to produce a shape-<br>
retaining alginate matrix filled with precipitated polysaccharide and enclosing plural oil<br>
droplets. The vitamins are thereby protected from oxidative degradation and can be<br>
handled like conventional crystalline solids.<br>
Algin is a polysaccharide found in brown algae. Alginates and their derivatives have<br>
become significantly important hydrocolloids and are applied in a wide variety of<br>
industrial fields.<br>
Algin is a polysaccharide that contains ß-(l ?4)-D-mannuroic acid of structure I:<br>
and a-(1?4)-L-guluronic acid of the structure II:<br>
Algin is a heterogeneous polymer consisting of the following three types of molecular<br>
blocks:<br>
a) M-block, consisting of only M-M linking;<br>
b) G-block, consisting of only G-G linking; and<br>
c) Random block, M and G randomly linked.<br>
Calcium alginate gel beads are used to entrap a wide variety of substances. The<br>
entrapment with calcium alginate is particularly favored because of the mild conditions<br>
employed and the nontoxicity of the reactants. Typically, the procedure simply involves<br>
dropping a 1-2% solution of sodium alginate into a 1-2% solution of calcium chloride.<br>
The alginate solution may be pumped through a small orifice, such as a needle, or<br>
rotating plate or vibrating droplets feeder and allowed to free-fall, producing a spherical<br>
bead, which gels upon contact with the calcium source. The beads then remain in the<br>
calcium bath until hardened.<br>
Islets of Langerhans, the cells producing the insulin in the pancreas, may be entrapped<br>
in an alginate polycation microcapsule to allow small molecules such as glucose and<br>
other nutrients to diffuse freely, while preventing the passage of large molecules and<br>
cells. Physico-chemical properties of the microcapsules, such as shape, size and<br>
permeability, can be controlled (Goosen et al., Applied Biotechnology and<br>
Bioengineering, 10, 87-98, 1984).<br>
According to US 4,389,419, "...the amount of oil used may range broadly between 1%<br>
and close to 30%. However, at the higher end of the range, the stability of the oil-in-<br>
water emulsion is decreased, and the quality of the microcapsule is reduced." (column 3<br>
lines 5-9).<br>
BASF Health and Nutrition publication dated 10.97 reports a process for<br>
microencapsulation using gelatin. In this report, the mean particle size of the final<br>
product is approx. 250µ and the concentration of the active ingredient is up to 50%.<br>
However, the BASF process involves the use of gelatin, which is an undesirable<br>
limitation. Gelatin is purified mainly from pigs and cows which are susceptible to The<br>
Mad Cow disease and the Foot and Mouth disease.<br>
U.S. 6,146,671 discloses a method for protecting a heat and/or oxygen-labile compound<br>
by encapsulation in a protective matrix of alginate and an additional polymeric material,<br>
which provides a single layer coating system. U.S. 6,146,671 farther suggests the use of<br>
gelatin as a preferred protective polymer. Recently, the market is looking for materials<br>
which are not derived from animals which are susceptible to Mad Cow Disease.<br>
In view of the above, the need for a stable, GMO-free, vegetable source alginate<br>
microcapsule having a high lipophilic compound content, small particle size with<br>
improved bioavailability, remains.<br>
It is therefore the objective of the present invention to provide a microencapsulated<br>
formulation of lipophilic compounds which contains a relatively high Iipophilic<br>
compound content with improved bioavailability and stability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a composition containing at<br>
least one microencapsulated lipophilic compound comprising:<br>
(i) particle size reduction of the lipophilic, compound in the presence of (1) a surface active<br>
agent and (2) water or a water miscible solvent or a mixture thereof, to provide a first<br>
composition comprising an emulsion or suspension of surface active coated lipophilic<br>
particle in said water or water miscible solvent or mixture thereof;<br>
(ii) providing a solution of alkali metal alginate;<br>
(ui)combining said first composition and the alkali metal alginate solution to provide a<br>
second composition;<br>
(iv) adding dropwise the second composition to a solution containing Ca2+, thereby obtaining<br>
beadlets having a second coating of Calcium alginate, and removing the formed beadlets<br>
from said solution;<br>
(v) rinsing the beadlets with an 0.1% to 10% acidic solution and dying said beadlets to obtain<br>
dried beadlets; and<br>
(vi) coating the dried beadlets with a third coating material to obtain microcapsules<br>
containing said lipophilic compound, said coating material being of vegetable origin and<br>
being selected from the group consisting of cellurose derivatives, waxes, fats, proteins<br>
and polysaccharides.<br>
compounds is not greater than 20 µm, and rinsing the alginate beadlets with an aqueous<br>
acidic solution before the final drying of the beadlets, provides a microcapsule wherein<br>
the lipophilic compound displays improved bioavailability.<br>
The lipophilic compounds suitable for the present invention are lipophilic compounds<br>
which are sensitive to heat or oxygenating conditions. Non-limiting examples of<br>
lipophilic compounds are carotenoids (e.g., lycopene, beta and alpha-carotene, lutem,<br>
astaxanthin, zeaxanthin), vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, omega 3, omega 6 oils and<br>
mixtures thereof. Further lipophilic compounds suitable for the present invention are<br>
lipophilic compounds which have a taste or smell which is required to be masked, e.g.,<br>
bitter tasting vitamins and fish oil. Throughout the description the term lipophilic<br>
compounds encompasses the foregoing definition and mixtures of said compounds.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the process of the present invention, a solution<br>
containing 0.01% to 5% of a surfactant agent, 0.1% to 5% of a lipophilic compound,<br>
wherein said lipophilic compounds are selected from among a group comprising of<br>
lycopene, beta-carotene, lutein ,alfa-carotene, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, vitamin A,<br>
vitamin E, vitamin D, omega 3 and omega 6 oils, or mixtures thereof, and 0% to 20% of<br>
a filler is prepared. Said solution is processed for size reduction of the particles of the<br>
lipophilic compounds. Wherein the lipophilic compound is in solid form said solution is<br>
processed in a grinder and wherein the lipophilic compound is in liquid form said<br>
solution is processed in a high shear mixer. The processing of the lipophilic compound<br>
with a surface active agent (surfactant) creates a coating of the surfactant around the<br>
particles of the lipophilic compound, i.e. a primary protective layer. Following size<br>
reduction, a separate alkali metal alginate solution is prepared by dissolving an alkali<br>
metal alginate in water to provide a solution containing 0.5% to 10% of an alkali metal<br>
alginate, preferably 1.5% sodium alginate in water. The alkali metal alginate solution is<br>
mixed with the solution containing the lipophilic compound. The resulting solution is<br>
homogenized to provide a substantially homogenous emulsion or dispersion which is<br>
added drop-wise to a solution containing 0.2% to 5% of Ca2+, preferably 1.5% calcium<br>
chloride. The drop-wise addition is carried out such that the drops are not bigger than<br>
1000 µm. Thus, upon contact of the drops with the Ca2+ solution, beadlets of lipophilic-<br>
compound-containing alginate is formed. This creates a second protective layer for the<br>
lipophilic compound. The size of the beadlets can be controlled by controlling the size<br>
of the droplets. Preferably the size of the drops is adjusted so as to provide beadlets in<br>
the size range of about 100 µm to 450 urn. The beadlets are than separated from the<br>
solution by conventional separating means, e.g., screening, and rinsed with an aqueous<br>
acidic solution. The acidic solution is preferably a 0.1% to 10% solution of an acid<br>
selected from among a group comprising of citric, aspartic, acetic, ascorbic, lactic,<br>
phosphoric or hydrochloric acid. More preferably, said acidic solution is a 2.5%<br>
solution of citric acid or phosphoric acid in water. The rinsing with an acidic solution<br>
effects shrinkage of the beadlets and improves the bioavailability of the<br>
microencapsulated lipophilic compound. The beadlets are then dried according to<br>
drying methods known in the art, preferably, by fluidized bed drying. "Drying" meaning<br>
lowering the water content below 10%. The dry beadlets are then coated with a coating<br>
material in a fluidized bed apparatus, according to the coating technique described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,710,384, incorporated herein by reference. Hence, a third coating<br>
layer is provided. Suitable coating materials for the final coating stage are cellulose<br>
derivatives, waxes, fats, proteins or polysaccharides. Non-limiting examples of cellulose<br>
derivatives suitable for coating material are: ethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and methyl cellulose. Waxes can be carnauba wax,<br>
candelila wax and beeswax. Fats can be hydrogenated vegetable oils, e.g. soybean and<br>
palm oil, mono and diglycerides, stearic, palmitic acids. Proteins can be albumins, zein,<br>
soy proteins or milk proteins. Polysaccharides can be starches, maltodextrins, pectins,<br>
xanthan gum, gum Arabic or carrageenan. According to a particular embodiment of the<br>
present invention, wherein there is no restriction regarding the use of products derived<br>
from animals, gelatin may be applied as a suitable protein for the third layer coating.<br>
The operation of size reduction in stage (i) of the present invention may be effected in a<br>
liquid medium. The liquid medium may be water or other water miscible solvents<br>
wherein non-limitive examples of suitable liquids are alcohols e.g., methanol, ethanol,<br>
iso-propanol, acetone and ethyl acetate. Accordingly, the liquid is added to the solution<br>
of stage (i) which contains the lipophilic compound and surface active agent.<br>
According to yet a further embodiment of the present invention, the drying and final<br>
coating are carried out in one step in a fluidized bed apparatus.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present invention when the lipophilic<br>
compound is in liquid form, stage (i) of the process is carried out so that the drop size of<br>
the lipophilic compound is reduced to a size not greater than 20 µm, preferably in the<br>
range of 3 µm to 7 µm, and the solution obtained from stage (i) is an emulsion or<br>
suspension.<br>
In yet a further preferred embodiment of the present invention the lipophilic compound<br>
is selected from among a group consisting of beta-carotene, lycopene, alpha-carotene,<br>
lutein, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, omega 3 and omega 6<br>
oils, wherein the microcapsule contains 0.1% to 40% of said lipophilic compound or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable fillers for use in stage (i) and/or (ii) of the process are selected from among a<br>
group comprising of polysaccharides e.g., pectin, starch, carrageenan, gum Arabic,<br>
xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
proteins from soybean, corn, milk or whey.<br>
The term "surfactant agent" refers to any substance which has emulsifying, colloidal,<br>
stabilizing or dispersing qualities. Non-limiting examples of suitable surfactants can be<br>
non-ionic, anionic or cationic surfactants, e.g., alcohol alkoxylates; alcohol ethoxylates;<br>
alkylphenol alkoxylates; alkylphenol ethoxylates; alkyl polysaccharides; block<br>
copolymers e.g., ethoxylated polypropylene oxides, alcoxylated ethylene diamine; esters<br>
e.g., glycerol mono and distearate, glycerol mono and dioleate; ethoxylated sorbitan<br>
esters and sorbitan esters, different proteins e.g. protein from soybean, corn or whey.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present composition, the<br>
microencapsulated lipophilic-cornpound-containing composition contains 0.1% to 40%<br>
of a lipophilic compound selected from among beta-carotene, lycopene, alpha-carotene,<br>
lutein, astaxanthin, zeaxanthin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, omega 3 and omega 6<br>
oils or mixtures thereof, wherein the particle size of the lipophilic compound is not<br>
greater than 10 µm, preferably between 2 µm and 5 µm. Said composition further<br>
comprises a surfactant, an alginate matrix which incorporates the surfactant-coated<br>
lipophilic compound and a coating which coats the lipophilic-compound-containing<br>
alginate matrix. The coating material is selected from among a group comprising of<br>
cellulose derivatives, waxes, fats, proteins and polysaccharides.<br>
The microencapsulated compositions according to the present invention are suitable for<br>
tablet preparation, hard shell capsule filling and incorporating in different foods.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the lipophilic<br>
compounds or mixtures thereof employed herein may further comprise fillers,<br>
excipients or additives. Examples of suitable fillers are starch, pectins, carraginanes,<br>
xanthan gums, proteins, polyethylene glycols, cellulose derivatives (e.g., methyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose and ethyl cellulose) and other polysaccharides.<br>
The microcapsule prepared according to the present invention comprises of three<br>
protective layers which protect the lipophilic compounds. The first protective layer is<br>
created by the surfactant; the second protective layer is created by the alginate matrix<br>
and the third layer is the final coating layer.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention The present process is suitable for<br>
encapsulating lipophilic compounds which have a taste or smell which is required to be<br>
masked. This is particularly important for introducing lipophilic compounds into food<br>
stuff and beverages wherein said lipophilic compound has a taste or smell which is<br>
offensive to the consumer or does not correlate with the taste or smell of the food stuff<br>
and beverage. For example masking the taste of a bitter tasting lipophilic compound<br>
wherein said lipophilic is added to a sweet or salty food. This effect is achieved by the<br>
present process without inhibiting the bioavailability of the lipophilic compound.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that it provides microcapsules of lipophilic<br>
compounds with improved stability, relatively high content of the lipophilic compound<br>
and improved bioavailability of the lipophilic compound. These advantages are<br>
achieved by the process which provides a three layer coating of the lipophilic compound<br>
and by the small particle size of said compounds. The advantages of the present<br>
composition are also found it the improved mechanical properties of the microcapsules<br>
which is achieved by the third layer coating. Thus, the microcapsules of the present<br>
invention are also tablet grade, i.e. suitable for use in tableting. Furthermore the<br>
compositions of the present invention are gelatin free. Due to the fact that the common<br>
use of gelatin is obviated according to the present invention, the product of the present<br>
invention is from vegetable origin.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>

A second solution was made at 70°C:<br>
(b)<br>
1. Sodium Alginate - 180.0g<br>
2. Sucrose palmitate - 22.7g.<br>
3. Starch (from Peas) - 120g<br>
4. Water - 12000.0 g<br>
Solution (a) was added to solution (b) and mixed to form a homogenous suspension.<br>
The dropping and coating processes are repeated, as in Example 1, with the coating<br>
solution containing:<br>
(c)<br>
1. Hydroxypropylcellulose - 95.9gr.<br>
2. Methanol - 242.0gr.<br>
3. Acetone - 506.0 gr.<br>

particle size of 70% of the beadlets between 150 and 400 microns.<br>
Example 4<br>
Encapsulation of DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) oil was performed in the following way:<br>
The following ingredients were homogenized together in a high sheer mixer to provide<br>
a fine emulsion:<br>
(a)<br>
1. DHA oil from algae (40% DHA) - 220g.<br>
2. Sorbitan monolaurate - 8.0g.<br>
3. Water - 1000.0g<br>
A second solution was prepared from the following materials:<br>
(b)<br>
1. Sodium alginate - 75.0g.<br>
2. Starch (from Peas) - 150.0g.<br>
3. Water - 9000g.<br>
The two solutions were mixed together to form a homogenous suspension. The<br>
dropping filtering, washing, drying and coating was performed as in Example 1. The<br>
coating solution was made from the following ingredients:<br>
(c)<br>
1. Hydroxypropyl cellulose - 85.0g.<br>
2. Methanol - 215g.<br>
3. Acetone - 447.0g.<br>
The process produced coated dry spherical beads of encapsulated DHA.<br>
Example 5 - Improved Bioavailability and Stability - Comparative Test<br>
The microcapsules prepared by the present invention were tested for stability<br>
and bioavailability. Stability tests were done by incubating the microcapsules in pure<br>
oxygen atmosphere for 10 to 40 days at room temperature (25°C) and then assay the<br>
microcapsules for their lipophilic compound content. Bioavailability was checked using<br>
a USP type 2 dissolution apparatus. The microcapsules were incubated in gastric fluid<br>
(0.1M HCl) for one hour at 37°C with the paddles rotating at 75RPM. Then the pH was<br>
raised to 7 with the addition of tri-sodium phosphate 0.2M solution. In addition, cholic<br>
acid 0.1% and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) 0.1% were added to simulate an intestinal<br>
fluid. After another three hours the solution was sampled and filtered. The filtrate was<br>
assayed for the concentration of the lipophilic compound. The bioavailability was<br>
estimated by the percent of the lipophilic compound from the microcapsules that was<br>
dissolved in the simulated intestinal fluid.<br>
Microcapsules prepared according to Example 1 were examined for<br>
bioavailability which was found to be 86%. A similar preparation in which the beta-<br>
carotene was not ground in the presence of the surfactant the bioavailability was 4%.<br>
This shows the importance of the first layer of coating and the particle size of the<br>
lipophilic compound in the bioavailability of the lipophilic compound.<br>
When the microcapsules that were made as in Example 3 were tested for<br>
stability the lycopene content of the microcapsules was reduced in ten days in oxygen<br>
atmosphere by 7%. Similar microcapsules that were not washed in acidic solution but<br>
prepared similarly otherwise their Lycopene content was lowered by 25% in ten days in<br>
oxygen atmosphere. This shows the importance of the acidic wash for the stability and<br>
bioavailability of the lipophilic compound.<br>
Example 6: Tableting of the microcapsules<br>
The suitability of the beadlets for tableting, i.e. tablet grade was evaluated by tablet<br>
compression in a Korsch EKII single punch tablet press. The beadlets (30g) were mixed<br>
with 190g of microcrystalline cellulose, 2.25g of magnesium stearate and 2.25g of<br>
sodium starch glycolate. The mixture was compressed in the tablet press using a 12mm<br>
die producing tablets of 680mg in weight with strength of 12kg. Using beadlets<br>
produced in Example 1 and 3 gave tablets spotted with dark red spots. When these<br>
tablets were put in oxygen atmosphere, as mentioned above, no reduction in the<br>
concentration of beta-carotene (Example 1) or Lycopene (Example 3) was observed<br>
after 10 days. In comparison, beadlets that were not coated with hydroxypropyl<br>
cellulose were produced. These beadlets were identical to those made in Example 1 and<br>
3 but were not coated with solutions (c) in each example. When these beadlets were<br>
compressed into tablets with the same composition, the tablets were stained orange<br>
indicating that the beta-carotene and the Lycopene were leaking out of the uncoated<br>
beadlets. In addition, these tablets show reduction in beta-carotene concentration (-30%)<br>
and in Lycopene concentration (-36%) in 10 days in oxygen atmosphere. This shows the<br>
importance of the third coating layer for the stability of the microencapsulated lipophilic<br>
compound and for its suitability to tablet compression.<br>
