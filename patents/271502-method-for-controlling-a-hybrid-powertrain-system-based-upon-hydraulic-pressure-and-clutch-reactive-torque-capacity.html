CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,632, filed on 11/05/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	This disclosure pertains to control systems for hybrid<br>
powertrain systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known hybrid powertrain architectures can include multiple<br>
torque-generative devices, including internal combustion engines and non-<br>
combustion machines, e.g., electric machines, which transmit torque through a<br>
transmission device to an output member. One exemplary hybrid powertrain<br>
includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission which<br>
utilizes an input member for receiving tractive torque from a prime mover<br>
power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an output<br>
member. The output member can be operatively connected to a driveline for a<br>
motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Machines, operative as<br><br>
motors or generators, can generate torque inputs to the transmission<br>
independently of a torque input from the internal combustion engine. The<br>
Machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy transmitted through the<br>
vehicle driveline to energy that is storable in an energy storage device. A<br>
control system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and<br>
provides operational control of the hybrid powertrain, including controlling<br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the power interchange among the energy<br>
storage device and the machines to manage outputs of the transmission,<br>
including torque and rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A powertrain system includes an engine coupled to an electro-<br>
mechanical transmission to transfer power between the engine and a plurality<br>
of torque generating machines and an output member. The transmission is<br>
operative in one of a plurality of operating range states through selective<br>
application of torque transfer clutches and the engine is operatively coupled to<br>
a main hydraulic pump to supply pressurized fluid to a hydraulic circuit<br>
operative to apply the torque transfer clutches. A method for controlling the<br>
powertrain system includes determining an output torque request to the output<br>
member, determining a pressure output of the main hydraulic pump based<br>
upon an engine input speed, calculating a clutch reactive torque capacity for<br>
each applied torque transfer clutch based upon the pressure output of the main<br>
hydraulic pump, and determining a preferred engine input speed to achieve the<br><br>
clutch reactive torque capacity to meet the output torque request to the output<br>
member.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary hybrid<br>
powertrain system. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system in accordance<br>
with the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1, comprising a two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission 10 operatively<br>
connected to an engine 14 and torque generating machines comprising first<br>
and second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14<br><br><br>
and first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate mechanical<br>
power which can be transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated<br>
by the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and<br>
transferred to the transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor<br>
torques, referred to herein as TI, TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred<br>
to herein as N|, NA,and NB, respectively.<br>
[0012] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed NI and the input torque TI to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump 88 and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0013] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. The hydraulic<br>
pump 88 supplies pressurized hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic control circuit<br>
('HYD') 42 that is preferably controlled by a transmission control module<br>
(hereafter 'TCM') 17 operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and<br><br><br>
C4 75 preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches.<br>
Clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
Each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably<br>
hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42. Clutch pressure, and thus clutch reactive torque is<br>
based upon and limited by the hydraulic pressure in the hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42. The operation of the hydraulic control circuit 42 including the<br>
hydraulic pump 88 to generate hydraulic pressure is described hereinbelow<br>
with reference to Fig. 8.<br>
[0014] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably<br>
comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a<br>
rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for<br>
each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0015] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br><br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NAand NB, respectively.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output<br>
torque To- A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a friction brake 94 and a sensor (not shown)<br>
adapted to monitor wheel speed, the output of which is monitored by a control<br>
module of a distributed control module system described with respect to Fig.<br>
2, to determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for<br>
braking control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 ( TI, TA, and TB respectively)<br>
are generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br><br><br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torque commands TA and TB- Electrical current is<br>
transmitted to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is<br>
being charged or discharged.<br>
[0018] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the motor<br>
torque commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA<br>
and TB. The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase<br>
power electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to<br>
AC power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate<br>
bipolar transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive<br>
control commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors for each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States<br>
of the insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br><br><br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0019] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control<br>
module system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an<br>
overall vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of<br>
the exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UI') 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain system. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an<br>
operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL').<br>
and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector<br>
114 may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br><br><br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other<br>
control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter<br>
'LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states<br>
of operating parameters and actuator command signals between the various<br>
control modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-<br>
specific. The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust<br>
messaging and multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned<br>
control modules, and other control modules providing functionality including<br>
e.g., antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torque commands TA<br>
and TB for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and<br>
functions to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14<br><br><br>
over a plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-<br>
directional interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque<br>
command from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input<br>
torque, TI, provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon<br>
monitored engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5, The<br>
ECM 23 monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the<br>
engine input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission<br>
input speed, NI. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br><br><br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX-<br>
[0025] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes 94 on each of the vehicle wheels 93. The BrCM<br>
22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and generates control<br>
signals to control the friction brakes 94 and sends a control signal to the HCP<br>
5 to operate the transmission 10 and the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72 based thereon. Braking preferably comprises a blending of friction<br>
braking and regenerative braking. Friction braking is effected by applying the<br>
friction brakes 94. Regenerative braking is effected through the driveline 90<br>
by selectively applying one of the clutches and controlling the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to react torque transferred from the driveline 90<br>
through the power inverters and respective motor control modules to meet the<br>
commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
[0026] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM<br>
21, and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising<br>
a microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br><br><br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0027] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several states that can be described in terms of engine states comprising one of<br>
an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'), and transmission<br>
operating range states comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br><br>
[0028] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('MlEngOn') or OFF<br>
('MI_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., NI/NO. A first fixed gear operation ('Gl') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br><br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NA and NB respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0029] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
brake pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or<br>
more of the other control modules determine torque commands to control the<br>
torque generating devices comprising the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output<br>
member 64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from<br>
the user interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP<br>
5 determines the operator torque request, the output torque command from the<br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, the input torque from the engine 14. clutch<br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0030] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors<br>
including, e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The engine state and<br>
the transmission operating range state are determined based upon operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br><br><br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The transmission operating<br>
range state and the engine state may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque<br>
generating mode. The transmission operating range state and the engine state<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines<br>
optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery<br>
state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque generating machines,<br>
and determines the power output from the transmission 10 at output member<br>
64 that is required to meet the operator torque request while meeting other<br>
powertrain operating demands, e.g., charging the ESD 74. As should be<br>
apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power<br>
flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to transfer power therebetween to generate a<br>
power flow to the output member 64.<br><br>
[0031] Fig. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generating devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of Figs. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned control<br>
modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The control<br>
system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain systems<br>
having multiple torque generating devices, including, e.g., a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid powertrain<br>
system having an engine and multiple electric machines. Alternatively, the<br>
hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque-generative machines<br>
and energy storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical hybrid transmissions<br>
(not shown).<br>
[0032] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and<br>
the brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request.<br>
The operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112<br>
comprise individually determinable operator torque request inputs including<br>
an immediate accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request<br>
Accel Immed'), a predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque<br>
Request Accel Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type<br>
('Axle Torque Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers<br>
to an operator request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing<br>
vehicle speed over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected<br>
position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the<br><br><br>
vehicle in the forward direction. The terms 'deceleration' and 'brake' refer to<br>
an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle speed from the<br>
present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque<br>
request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque<br>
response type are individual inputs to the control system. Additionally,<br>
operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine<br>
the input speed ('Ni')and the output speed ('No').<br>
[0033] The immediate accelerator output torque request is determined<br>
based upon a presently occurring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113,<br>
and comprises a request to generate an immediate output torque at the output<br>
member 64 preferably to accelerate the vehicle. The predicted accelerator<br>
output torque request is determined based upon the operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an optimum or preferred output torque at<br>
the output member 64. The predicted accelerator output torque request is<br>
preferably equal to the immediate accelerator output torque request during<br>
normal operating conditions, e.g., when any one of antilock braking, traction<br>
control, or vehicle stability is not being commanded. When any one of<br>
antilock braking, traction control of vehicle stability is being commanded the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request remains the preferred output torque<br>
with the immediate accelerator output torque request being decreased in<br>
response to output torque commands related to the antilock braking, traction<br>
control, or vehicle stability control.<br>
[0034] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based<br>
upon a presently occurring operator input to the brake pedal 112, and<br><br><br>
comprises a request to generate an immediate output torque at the output<br>
member 64 to effect a reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably<br>
decelerates the vehicle. The predicted brake output torque request comprises<br>
an optimum or preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in<br>
response to an operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum<br>
brake output torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of<br>
the operator input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum<br>
brake output torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g.<br>
The predicted brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when<br>
vehicle speed approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake<br>
pedal 112. When commanded by the operator, there can be operating<br>
conditions under which the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero,<br>
e.g., when the operator setting to the transmission gear selector 114 is set to a<br>
reverse gear, and when a transfer case (not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive<br>
low range.<br>
[0035] A strategic control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a<br>
preferred input speed ('NiDes') and a preferred engine state and transmission<br>
operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed<br>
and the operator torque request and based upon other operating parameters of<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and response limits of<br>
the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72. The predicted accelerator output torque request and the predicted<br>
brake output torque request are input to the strategic control scheme 310. The<br>
strategic control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each<br>
100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle. The desired operating range<br><br><br>
state for the transmission 10 and the desired input speed from the engine 14 to<br>
the transmission 10 are inputs to the shift execution and engine start/stop<br>
control scheme 320.<br>
[0036] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation ('Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('Ni_Prof) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle. The engine operating commands<br>
and the operator torque request are based upon the input speed profile during a<br>
transition in the operating range state of the transmission.<br>
[0037J A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine commands<br>
('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a preferred input<br>
torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon the output speed,<br>
the input speed, and the operator torque request comprising the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request, the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request, the immediate brake output torque request, the predicted brake output<br>
torque request, the axle torque response type, and the present operating range<br><br><br>
state for the transmission. The engine commands also include engine states<br>
including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder deactivation<br>
operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are deactivated and<br>
unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and a fuel cutoff<br>
state. An engine command comprising the preferred input torque of the<br>
engine 14 and the present input torque ('Ti') reacting between the engine 14<br>
and the input member 12 are preferably determined in the ECM 23. Clutch<br>
reactive torques ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75, including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches are<br>
estimated, preferably in the TCM 17.<br>
[0038] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('To_cmd'). This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') to transfer a net commanded output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that meets the operator<br>
torque request, by controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
in this embodiment. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
immediate brake output torque request, the present input torque from the<br>
engine 14 and the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the present operating<br>
range state of the transmission 10, the input speed, the input speed profile, and<br>
the axle torque response type are inputs. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 executes to determine the motor torque commands<br>
during each iteration of one of the loop cycles. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly<br><br>
executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the<br>
preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0039] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque<br>
at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input<br>
to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
the output torque to the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0040] Fig. 4 details signal flow in the strategic optimization control<br>
scheme 310, which includes a strategic manager 220, an operating range state<br>
analyzer 260, and a state stabilization and arbitration block 280 to determine<br>
the preferred input speed ('NiDes') and the preferred transmission operating<br>
range state ('Hybrid Range State Des'). The strategic manager ('Strategic<br>
Manager') 220 monitors the output speed N0, the predicted accelerator output<br>
torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel Prdtd'), the predicted brake<br>
output torque request ('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd'), and available<br>
battery power PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The strategic manager 220 determines<br><br><br>
which of the transmission operating range states are allowable, and determines<br>
output torque requests comprising a strategic accelerator output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Accel Strategic') and a strategic net output torque<br>
request ('Output Torque Request Net Strategic'), all of which are input the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260 along with system inputs ('System Inputs')<br>
and power cost inputs ('Power Cost Inputs'). The operating range state<br>
analyzer 260 generates a preferred power cost ('P*cost') and associated input<br>
speed ('N*i') for each of the allowable operating range states based upon the<br>
operator torque requests, the system inputs, the available battery power and<br>
the power cost inputs. The preferred power costs and associated input speeds<br>
for the allowable operating range states are input to the state stabilization and<br>
arbitration block 280 which selects the preferred operating range state and<br>
preferred input speed based thereon.<br>
[0041] Fig. 5 shows the operating range state analyzer 260, which<br>
executes searches in each candidate operating range state comprising the<br>
allowable ones of the operating range states, including Ml (262), M2 (264),<br>
Gl (270), G2 (272), G3 (274), and G4 (276) to determine preferred operation<br>
of the torque actuators, i.e., the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 in this embodiment. The preferred operation preferably<br>
comprises a minimum power cost for operating the hybrid powertrain system<br>
and an associated engine input for operating in the candidate operating range<br>
state in response to the operator torque request. The associated engine input<br>
comprises at least one of a preferred engine input speed ('Ni*'), a preferred<br>
engine input power ('Pi*'), and a preferred engine input torque ('Ti*') that is<br>
responsive to and preferably meets the operator torque request. The operating<br><br><br>
range state analyzer 260 evaluates Ml-Engine Off (264) and M2-Engine Off<br>
(266) to determine a preferred cost ('P*cost') for operating the powertrain<br>
system responsive to and preferably meeting the operator torque request when<br>
the engine 14 is in the engine-off state.<br>
[0042] Fig. 6 schematically shows signal flow for a 1-dimension search<br>
scheme that is preferably executed for each of Gl (270), G2 (272), G3 (274),<br>
and G4 (276) to determine the preferred operation. A range of one<br>
controllable input, in this embodiment comprising minimum and maximum<br>
input torques (Ti Min/Max'), is input to a 1-D search engine 415. The engine<br>
power output and thus engine torque input to the transmission 14 varies over<br>
the range of input speeds Ni. The input speed ('Ni') is determined in each of<br>
the candidate fixed gear operating range states based upon the gear ratio, for<br>
the transmission output speed No that is input to the strategic control scheme<br>
310.<br>
[0043] The 1-D search engine 415 iteratively generates candidate input<br>
torques ('Ti(j)') which range between the minimum and maximum input<br>
torques, each which is input to an optimization function ('Opt To/Ta/Tb') 440,<br>
for n search iterations. Other inputs to the optimization function 440 include<br>
system inputs comprising parametric states related to battery power, electric<br>
motor operation, transmission and engine operation, the specific operating<br>
range state and the operator torque request.<br>
[0044] The system inputs include clutch reactive torque capacity, i.e.,<br>
maximum and minimum clutch reactive torques ('TCL Min/Max') for the<br>
applied clutches for the candidate fixed gear operating range state. In<br>
operation, the input speed ('Ni') is combined with a capability of the hydraulic<br><br><br>
system to generate pressure ('Pr Main Cap') (413) to determine a main<br>
hydraulic pressure ('Pmain'). In one embodiment, the control system includes<br>
a lookup table stored in memory to determine the main hydraulic pressure<br>
based upon the input speed. Fig. 8 shows the datagraph that illustrates a<br>
capability of an exemplary hydraulic control circuit 42 including the main<br>
hydraulic pump 88 to generate hydraulic pressure ('Pr Main Cap') based upon<br>
the input speed Ni. The hydraulic control system 42 preferably includes an<br>
electrically powered auxiliary pump (not shown) that generates a minimum<br>
hydraulic pressure when the input speed is zero, i.e., the engine-off state<br>
('Ni=0'), and when the engine 14 is operating at idle ('Idle'). When the input<br>
speed increases from zero, e.g., when the engine 14 is spinning, the main<br>
hydraulic pump 88 generates hydraulic pressure. As depicted, the hydraulic<br>
pressure in the hydraulic control circuit does not increase above the minimum<br>
hydraulic pressure until the input speed exceeds the idle speed. When the<br>
input speed exceeds the idle speed, the main hydraulic pump 88 pumps<br>
hydraulic fluid to generate hydraulic pressure that increases with increasing<br>
engine input speed, leveling off at a maximum hydraulic pressure (not shown)<br>
that can be determined based upon a capacity of the specific hydraulic pump.<br>
[0045] The control system determines the maximum and minimum clutch<br>
reactive torques ('TCL Min/Max') based upon the hydraulic pressure<br>
capability ('Pr Main Cap') and the operating range state, which determines the<br>
specifically applied clutch(es) (414). In operation, the maximum clutch<br>
reactive torque is determined as set forth in the following equation:<br>
TCL_Max = Kn * (PMAIN - PRET)	[1]<br><br>
wherein Kn comprises a scalar gain term describing clutch reactive torque as<br>
a function of pressure gain for the applied clutch,<br>
PMAIN is the main hydraulic pressure determined based upon the<br>
engine input speed, and<br>
PRET is a return spring pressure for the applied clutch.<br>
The minimum clutch reactive torque TCL Min is determined to be a negative<br>
value of the maximum clutch reactive torque.<br>
[0046] The optimization function 440 determines transmission operation<br>
comprising an output torque, motor torques, and associated battery and<br>
electrical powers ('To(j), Ta(j), Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j), Pb(j)') associated with the<br>
candidate input torque based upon the system inputs including the maximum<br>
and minimum clutch torques in response to the operator torque request for the<br>
candidate operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and<br>
associated battery and electrical powers and power cost inputs are input to a<br>
cost function 450, which executes to determine a power cost ('Pcost(j)') for<br>
operating the powertrain at the candidate input torque in response to the<br>
operator torque request. The 1-D search engine 415 iteratively generates the<br>
candidate input torques over the range of input torques. The optimization<br>
function 440 and the cost function 450 determine power costs associated with<br>
each candidate input torque. A preferred input torque ('Ti*') and associated<br>
preferred cost ('P*cost') are identified. The preferred input torque ('Ti*')<br>
comprises the candidate input torque within the range of input torques that<br>
results in a minimum power cost of the candidate operating range state, i.e.,<br>
the preferred cost.<br><br><br>
[0047] The preferred operation in each of Ml and M2 can be determined<br>
by executing a 2-dimensional search scheme that can be executed in each of<br>
Ml (262) and M2 (264), shown with reference to Fig. 7. Fig. 7 schematically<br>
shows signal flow for the 2-dimension search scheme. Ranges of two<br>
controllable inputs, in this embodiment comprising minimum and maximum<br>
input speeds ('Ni Min/Max') and minimum and maximum input powers ('Pi<br>
Min/Max') are input to a 2-D search engine 410. The 2-D search engine 410<br>
iteratively generates candidate input speeds ('Ni(j)') and candidate input<br>
powers ('Pi(j)') which range between the minimum and maximum input<br>
speeds and powers. The candidate input power is preferably converted to a<br>
candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') (412). Each candidate input speed ('Ni(j)') is<br>
input to a pre-optimization function (418). Other inputs to the pre-<br>
optimization function (418) include the hydraulic pressure capability<br>
('Pr_Main_Cap (Ni)') and the operating range state, as previously described.<br>
[0048] The pre-optimization function (418) generates a range comprising<br>
maximum and minimum clutch reactive torques ('TCL_Min/Max(j)') based<br>
upon the candidate input speed Ni(j) (413, 414). Other outputs of the pre-<br>
optimization function 418 include a range of motor torques ('Ta Min/Max(j)',<br>
('Tb Min/Max(j)') for the candidate operating point. The optimization<br>
function 440 determines transmission operation comprising an output torque,<br>
motor torques, and associated battery and electrical powers ('To(j), Ta(j),<br>
Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j), Pb(j)') associated with the candidate input torque OTi(j)')<br>
and candidate input speed ('Ni(j)'), limited by the range of minimum and<br>
maximum input powers from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 ('Pi<br>
Min/Max') and based upon the system inputs including the maximum and<br><br><br>
minimum clutch torques and the operating torque request for the candidate<br>
operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and associated<br>
battery powers and power cost inputs are input to a cost function 450, which<br>
executes to determine a power cost (Tcost(j)') for operating the powertrain at<br>
the candidate input power and candidate input speed in response to the<br>
operator torque request in the candidate operating range state. The 2-D search<br>
engine 410 iteratively generates the candidate input speeds and candidate input<br>
powers over the range of input speeds and range of input powers and<br>
determines the power costs associated therewith to identify a preferred input<br>
power ('P*') and preferred input speed('Ni*') and associated preferred cost<br>
('P*cost'). The preferred input power ('P*') and preferred input speed ('N*')<br>
comprises the candidate input power and candidate input speed that result in a<br>
minimum power cost for the candidate operating range state.<br>
[0049] The power cost inputs to the cost function 450 are determined<br>
based upon factors related to vehicle driveability, fuel economy, emissions,<br>
and battery usage. Power costs are assigned and associated with fuel and<br>
electrical power consumption and are associated with a specific operating<br>
points of the hybrid powertrain. Lower operating costs can be associated with<br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for each engine speed/load operating point, and<br>
take into account the candidate operating state of the engine 14. The power<br>
costs include engine power losses, electric motor power losses, battery power<br>
losses, brake power losses, and mechanical power losses associated with<br>
operating the hybrid powertrain at a specific operating point which includes<br><br>
input speed, motor speeds, input torque, motor torques, a transmission<br>
operating range state and an engine state.<br>
[0050] The state stabilization and arbitration block 280 selects a preferred<br>
transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') which<br>
preferably is the transmission operating range state associated with the<br>
minimum preferred cost for the allowed operating range states output from the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260, taking into account factors related to<br>
arbitrating effects of changing the operating range state on the operation of the<br>
transmission to effect stable powertrain operation. The preferred input speed<br>
('Ni_Des') is the engine input speed associated with the preferred engine input<br>
comprising the preferred engine input speed ('Ni*'), the preferred engine input<br>
power ('Pi*'), and the preferred engine input torque ('Ti*') that is responsive<br>
to and preferably meets the operator torque request for the selected preferred<br>
operating range state.<br>
[0051] The evaluation of candidate input speeds Ni(j) based in part upon<br>
hydraulic pressure and correlative minimum and maximum clutch reactive<br>
torques ('TCL Min/Max(j)') in the operating range state analyzer 260 is<br>
intended to assure that the transmission operation comprising the output torque<br>
('To(j)') associated with the candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') is not limited by<br>
the minimum and maximum clutch reactive torques ('TCL Min/Max(j)')<br>
achievable at the candidate input torque.<br>
[0052] In operation the control system acts to control the engine input<br>
speed NI to control the clutch reactive torque capacity to effect torque transfer<br>
across the applied clutch(es). This can affect system operation at system<br>
operating conditions wherein the engine may be in an engine-off state or be<br><br><br>
operating at slow speeds, and the demand for torque transfer through the<br>
transmission 10 across the applied clutch(es) exceeds the clutch reactive<br>
torque(s) of the applied clutch(es). Under such operating conditions, the<br>
control system can act to increase the engine input speed to increase hydraulic<br>
pressure to increase the clutch reactive torque capacity. Such system<br>
operating conditions can include an operator torque request through the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 wherein the engine is at idle or in the engine-off state,<br>
such as occurs during a vehicle launch. Another system operating condition<br>
can include system operation at higher speed when an operator torque request<br>
through the accelerator pedal 113 goes to zero including an input to the brake<br>
pedal 112, which can lead to a regenerative braking operation. Under such<br>
operating conditions, the control system can act to limit a decrease in the<br>
engine input speed to limit a decrease in the hydraulic pressure to maintain the<br>
clutch reactive torque capacity sufficient to effect torque transfer through the<br>
transmission 10 to react with the first and second electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0053] Fig. 9 shows operation of an exemplary system, including a signal<br>
input from an accelerator pedal ('AP') 113 and input speed NI and output<br>
speed No ('No Output Speed') shown plotted over elapsed time ('Time'). At a<br>
point in time, system operation changes due to an operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113 comprising a part throttle tip-in ('Part-Throttle Tip In'),<br>
which is the operator torque request used to determine the predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request and the immediate accelerator output torque<br>
request that are inputs to the control system described beginning with Fig. 3.<br>
A first line ('A') depicts the input speed operation of the engine 14 in response<br>
to the input to the accelerator pedal 113, including a response time delay and<br><br><br>
without compensation or adjustment for the clutch reactive torque capacity.<br>
The engine input speed in this condition does not spin the hydraulic pump 88<br>
sufficiently to generate hydraulic pressure to supply pressurized hydraulic<br>
fluid to the hydraulic control circuit 42 to meet the output torque request<br>
('Input Speed Too Low to Carry Output Torque Request'). A second line<br>
depicts the input speed operation of the engine 14 in response to the input to<br>
