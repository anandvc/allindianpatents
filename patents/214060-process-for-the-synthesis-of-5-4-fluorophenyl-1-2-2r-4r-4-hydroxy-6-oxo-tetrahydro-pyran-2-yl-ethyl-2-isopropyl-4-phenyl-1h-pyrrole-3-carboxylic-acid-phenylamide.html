An improved synthesis for the preparation of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxyIic acid phenylamide is described where methyl cyanoacetate is converted in eight operations or fewer to the desired product, as well as other valuable intermediates used in the process.<br>

])5	The asymmetric reduction of P-ketoesters, as well as P-diketones, is a<br>
well-established transformation in organic synthesis. However, the complexity of<br>
these reactions increases in the case of 1,3,5-tricarbonyl systems and poor yields<br>
and poor stereoselectivities often result. In fact, investigations by Saburi<br>
(Tetrahedron, 1997,1993;49) and Carpentier (Eur. J. Org. Chem. 1999;3421)<br>
2)0	have independently demonstrated low to moderate diastereo- and/or enantio-<br>
selectivities for diketoester asymmetric hydrogenations. Furthermore, the fact that<br>
the processes in the prior art require high pressure hydrogenation and extended<br>
reaction times makes these procedures unpractical and not amenable to large-scale<br>
manufacturing processes.<br>
2|5	However, we have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the diol esters<br>
of the present invention, (R)-7-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl-3-phenyl-4-<br>
phenylcarbamoyl-pyrrol-l-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid esters, can be<br>
obtained directly from the corresponding 1,3,5-tricarbonyl precursors in a highly<br>
stereoselective manner via a mild and efficient ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric<br>
3j0	hydrogenation reaction utilizing chiral non-racemic diphosphine ligands in the<br>
presence of secondary activating agents such as protic acids.<br><br><br>

The object of the present invention is a short and efficient process for the preparation of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-l-[2-((2R,4R)-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-tetrahydro-pyran-2-yl)-ethyl]-2-isopropyl-4-phenyl-li?-pyiTole-3-carboxylic acid phenylamide. The present process avoids the use of a costly chiral raw material ((R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxy-butyric acid ethyl ester), and a low temperature diastereoselective borane reduction. Furthermore, a key Paal-Knorr condensation step, common to the present and prior art processes, has been improved through a significant decrease in reaction time.<br>
Thus, the present process has significant advantages over the prior art processes and is amenable to large-scale synthesis.<br><br>

A nitrogen inerted reactor equipped with reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet and mechanical stirring is charged with morpholine (1.2 mol), methyl cyanoacetate (1.0 mol), and MtBE (52 mL). The homogeneous solution is heated to ca. 55°C and stirred at that temperature for 12 to 18 hours. MtBE (33 mL) is added over ca. 15 minutes, and the solution is slowly cooled below 50°C until<br>
nucleation becomes evident. Additional MtBE (66 mL) is added over a 1-hour period. During this time, the reaction is allowed to cool to near ambient temperature. After complete MtBE addition, the reaction is cooled with stirring to ca. 0°C. The resulting precipitate is collected via filtration and the cake is washed with additional MtBE (40 mL). The crude 3-morpholin-4-yl-3-oxo-propionitrile is taken up in MeOH (2 L) and transferred to a nitrogen inerted pressure reactor that has been charged with 5% Pt-C (55 g; 58% water-wet). HCI (12 N; 1.1 mol) is added at such a rate as to maintain an internal temperature of ca. 25 °C. The vessel and its contents are degassed via three N2 pressure purges (50 psi). The atmosphere is switched to hydrogen via three H2 pressure purges (50 psi), and the reaction is stirred vigorously at ca. 25 °C under a sustained pressure of hydrogen (50 psi) for ca. 24 hours. The H2 pressure is released and replaced with N2. The<br>
reaction is passed through filter agent, which is subsequently washed with MeOH (500 mL). The reaction is concentrated to a MeOH-wet solid, which is reslurried in IPA (100 mL). The slurry is cooled to 00C and filtered. The filter cake is washed with cold (0°C) IPA (75 mL) and reslurried in MeOH (500 mL) and MteE (500 mL).

The reaction mixture is cooled to -5°C and LiOH (38.2 mmol) is added. After stirring for 1 hour at -5°C the reaction is quenched with 37% HCl (42 mmol) and toluene (125 mL). After the mixture is wanned to ambient temperature, the reaction is concentrated to a volume of ca. 15 mL. Additional toluene (50 mL) is added and the reaction is concentrated via distillation to a crude oil that solidifies upon standing. The crude residue is taken up in DME (340 mL). To this solution is added deionized water (20 mL),/?-toluenesulfonic acid (2.25 g) and 5% Pd/C (11 g; 50% water-wet). The resulting mixture is heated to 45°C under a N2<br>
atmosphere for 1.5 hours and at ambient temperature for an additional 16 hours. The solution is passed through filter aid to remove catalyst, and solvent is removed in vacuo. The residue is taken up in toluene (50 mL). Water (75 mL) and KOH (950 mg) are added, and the reaction mixture is heated to 65°C where the layers are separated.
