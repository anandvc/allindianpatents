				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERFORMING SOFT-HANDOFF IN A<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Cross-reference to Related Application<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application serial no.<br>
10/439,743, Attorney Docket No. CE11382R, filed May 16, 2003, and further claims<br>
priority from U.S. provisional application serial no. 60/483,807, filed June 30, 2003,<br>
which is commonly owned and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems and, in<br>
particular, to soft-handoffs in a wireless communication system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Wireless communication systems are well known and consist of many types<br>
including land mobile radio, cellular radiotelephone (inclusive of analog cellular, digital<br>
cellular, personal communication systems (PCS) and wideband digital cellular systems),<br>
and other communication system types. In cellular radiotelephone communication<br>
systems, for example, a number of communication cells are typically comprised of one or<br>
more Base Transceiver Stations (BTS's) coupled to one or more Base Station Controllers<br>
(BSCs) or Central Base Station Controllers (CBSCs) and forming a Base Station<br>
Subsystem (BSS). The BSCs or CBSCs are, in turn, coupled to a Mobile Switching<br>
Center (MSC) which provides a connection between the BSS and an external network,<br>
such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), as well as interconnection to<br>
other BSSs. Each BTS provides communication services to a mobile station (MS)<br>
located in a coverage area serviced by the BTS via a communication resource that<br>
includes a forward link for transmitting signals to, and a reverse link for receiving signals<br>
from, the MS.<br><br>
Fundamental to a wireless communication system is the ability to maintain<br>
established communication connections while an MS moves in and between coverage<br>
areas. In order to maintain established communication connections, lsoft-handoff<br>
techniques have been developed for code division multiple access (CDMA)<br>
communication systems whereby an MS is in concurrent, active communication with<br>
multiple BTSs. Each BTS in active communication with the MS is a member of an<br>
'active set' of the MS and transmits bearer traffic to, and receives bearer traffic from, the<br>
MS. As the MS moves through the communication system, BTSs are added to, or deleted<br>
from, the MS's active set so as to assure that the MS will always be in communication<br>
with at least one BTS.<br>
For example, FIG. 1 is block diagram of a CDMA wireless communication<br>
system 100 of the prior art. Communication system 100 includes a BSS 104 comprising<br>
multiple BTSs 106-108 that are each coupled to a CBSC 110. BSS 104 is coupled to an<br>
MSC 114 and MSC 114 is in turn coupled to an external network 116 and provides a<br>
communication link between the external network, or other BSSs, and BSS 104.<br>
Communication system 100 further includes an MS 102 that concurrently is in active<br>
communication with each of BTS 106 and 107. That is, MS 102 is in 'soft-handoff with<br>
each of BTSs 106 and 107 and each of BTS 106 and BTS 107 is a member of an 'active<br>
set' of MS 102. As members of the active set of MS 102, each BTS of BTSs 106 and 107<br>
concurrently maintains a respective wireless communication link 120, 130 with the MS.<br>
Each communication link 120, 130 includes a respective forward link 122, 132, for<br>
conveyance of signals to MS 102 and a respective reverse link 124, 134, for receipt of<br>
signals from the MS.<br>
Each BTS 106,107 in the active set of MS 102 conveys the same bearer traffic to,<br>
and receives the same bearer traffic from, the MS. By providing multiple BTSs that<br>
concurrently convey same signals to, and receive same signals, from MS 102,<br>
communication system 100 enhances the likelihood that the MS will receive an<br>
acceptable quality signal from BSS 104 and that the BSS will receive an acceptable<br>
quality signal from the MS. For example, when each BTS of BTSs 106 and 107 receives<br>
a same frame from MS 102, the BTS determines whether the received frame is acceptable<br>
or erroneous and forwards the frame, and an accompanying indicator of whether the<br><br>
frame is acceptable, that is, good, or erroneous, that is, erased, to CBSC 110. CBSC 110,<br>
specifically a selection and distribution unit (SDU) 112 included in the CBSC, then<br>
selects a version of the received frame from among the versions received from BTSs 106<br>
and 107 and forwards the selected version to MSC 114.<br>
As MS 102 heads towards a coverage area, or sector, associated with BTS 108, a<br>
signal strength of a pilot signal received by MS 102 from BTS 108 via a forward link 142<br>
associated with BTS 108 increases until MS 102 identifies the pilot signal from BTS 108<br>
as a viable communication link. In addition, as MS 102 heads away from a coverage<br>
area, or sector, associated with BTS 106 a signal strength of a pilot signal received by MS<br>
102 from BTS 106 via forward link 122 may deteriorate to the point that MS 102<br>
determines that communication link 120 is no longer a viable communication link. MS<br>
102 then requests that communication system 100 add BTS 108 to the MS's active set,<br>
that is, establish a communication link 140 associated with BTS 108, comprising forward<br>
link 142 and a reverse link 144, as an active communication link for transmitting data to,<br>
and receiving data from, MS 102, and drop BTS 106 from the active set, that is, terminate<br>
communication link 120. Typically, the request to drop a BTS is conveyed by MS 102<br>
via a Pilot Strength Measurement Message (PSMM). Upon receiving the PSMM<br>
message, BSS 104 drops BTS 106 from the active set of MS 102 and terminates, or<br>
drops, communication link 120 between MS 102 and BTS 106.<br>
A decision to add or drop a communication link 120, 130, 140 and a<br>
corresponding BTS 106, 107, 108 from an active set is based on a forward link<br>
measurement, that is, a measurement of a signal strength of a pilot signal received by an<br>
MS, such as MS 102, via a corresponding forward link. That is, in making an add and/or<br>
drop decision, communication system 100 assumes that a performance of a forward link<br>
122, 132, 142 is substantially identical to a performance of a corresponding reverse link<br>
124, 134, and 144. However, a problem arises when there is an imbalance between a<br>
performance of a forward link, such as forward links 122,132,142, and a performance of<br>
a corresponding reverse link, that is, respective reverse links 124, 134, and 144. For<br>
example, a sector serviced by a BTS may be subject to interference particular to a reverse<br>
link, or propagation paths and fading associated with each of a forward link and a reverse<br>
link in a sector may be different due to frequency band separation between the forward<br><br>
and reverse links. As a result, in some cases a communication link with a strong reverse<br>
link may be dropped due to a weak forward link while a communication link with a weak<br>
reverse link may be added due to a strong forward link. When the reverse link of the<br>
dropped communication link, such as reverse link 124 of communication link 120, is the<br>
only good reverse link of multiple reverse links, such as reverse links 124 and 134,<br>
utilized by an MS while the reverse link of the added communication link, such as reverse<br>
link 144 of communication link 140, is of unacceptable quality, then the dropping of the<br>
communication link may result in a dropped call.<br>
Thus, a need exists to ensure that a communication link is not terminated, or<br>
dropped, as part of a soft-handoff until such time as the communication system may<br>
confirm that an acceptable quality reverse link is being added.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To address the need for a method and an apparatus that ensures that a first<br>
communication link with the only acceptable reverse link is not dropped while a second<br>
communication link with an unacceptable reverse link is added during a soft-handoff, a<br>
communication system is provided that, when performing the soft-handoff, determines<br>
whether to engage in an analysis of a reverse link associated with a base station under<br>
consideration to be added to an active set of a mobile station. Upon determining not to<br>
analyze the reverse link, the communication system adds the base station to the active set<br>
without evaluating the associated reverse link. Upon determining to engage in a reverse<br>
link analysis, the communication system evaluates the reverse link in order to assure that<br>
a communication link is not terminated, or dropped, as part of the soft-handoff until such<br>
time as the communication system may confirm that an acceptable quality reverse link is<br>
being added. The communication system then determines whether to add the base station<br>
to the active set based upon the evaluation. Upon determining to not add the base station<br>
to the active set, the communication system may further monitor the forward links<br>
associated with the MS to determine whether to re-consider adding the base station, and<br>
the communication links associated with the base station, to the active set.<br>
Generally, an embodiment of the present invention encompasses a method for<br>
performing a soft-handoff in a wireless communication system. The method includes<br>
receiving a request to add a base station to an active set of a mobile station and<br>
determining whether to analyze a reverse link associated with base station. Upon<br>
determining not to analyze the reverse link, the method further includes adding the base<br>
station to the active set without evaluating the reverse link. Upon determining to analyze<br>
the reverse link, the method further includes evaluating the reverse link and, upon<br>
evaluating the reverse link, determining whether to add the base station to the active set<br>
based upon the evaluation.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention encompasses an apparatus for<br>
performing a soft-handoff in a wireless infrastructure. The apparatus includes a processor<br>
that determines whether to analyze a reverse link associated with a base station under<br>
consideration to be added to an active set of a mobile station, upon determining not to<br><br>
analyze the reverse link, adds the base station to the active set without evaluating the<br>
reverse link, upon determining to analyze the reverse link, evaluates the reverse link, and<br>
upon evaluating the reverse link, determines whether to add the base station to the active<br>
set base upon the evaluation.<br>
The present invention may be more fully described with reference to FIGs. 2-6.<br>
FIG. 2 is block diagram of a CDMA wireless communication system 200 in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention. Similar to communication system 100,<br>
communication system 200 includes a Base Station Subsystem (BSS) 204 comprising<br>
multiple Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) 206-209 (four shown) that are each coupled to<br>
a controller 212, such as a Base Station Controller (BSC) or a Central Base Station<br>
Controller (CBSC). BSS 204 is coupled to a mobile switching center (MSC) 260 and<br>
MSC 260 is in turn coupled to an external network 262 and provides a communication<br>
link between the external network, or other BSSs (not shown), and BSS 204. BSS 204<br>
and MSC 260 may collectively be referred to as an infrastructure of communication<br>
system 200.<br>
Each of the multiple BTSs 206-209 and controller 212, preferably a Selection and<br>
Distribution Unit (SDU) 214 included in the controller, comprises a respective processor<br>
210, 215 such as one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors<br>
(DSPs), combinations thereof or such other devices known to those having ordinary skill<br>
in the art Each of the multiple BTSs 206-209 and controller 212 further includes a<br>
respective one or more memory devices 211, 216 respectively associated with the<br>
processor 210, 215, such as random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access<br>
memory (DRAM), and/or read only memory (ROM) or equivalents thereof, that store<br>
data and programs that may be executed by the processor. Controller 212 may further<br>
include a timer 218 that is coupled to SDU 214.<br>
Communication system 200 further includes a mobile station (MS) 202 that is<br>
concurrently in active communication with each BTS of multiple BTSs 206-208. That is,<br>
MS 202 is in 'soft-handoff mode with the multiple BTSs 206-208 and each BTS of the<br>
multiple BTSs 206-208 is a member of an 'active sef of MS 202. As members of the<br>
active set of MS 202, each BTS of the multiple BTSs 206-208 concurrently maintains a<br><br>
respective wireless communication link 220, 230, 240 with the MS. Each communication<br>
link 220, 230, 240 includes a respective forward link 222, 232, 242 for conveyance of<br>
signals to MS 202 and a respective reverse link 224, 234, 244 for receipt of signals from<br>
the MS.<br>
Preferably, communication system 200 is a Code Division Multiple Access<br>
(CDMA) communication system, in which each of forward links 222, 232, 242, and 252<br>
and reverse links 224, 234, 244, and 254 comprises multiple communication channels,<br>
such as access channels, control channels, paging channels, and traffic channels. Each<br>
communication channel of a reverse link 224, 232, 242, 252 or a forward link 224, 234,<br>
244,254 comprises an orthogonal code, such as a Walsh Code, that may be transmitted in<br>
a same frequency bandwidth as the other channels of the link. However, those who are of<br>
ordinary skill in the art realize that communication system 200 may operate in accordance<br>
with any wireless telecommunication system, such as but not limited to a Global System<br>
for Mobile Communications (GSM) communication system, a Time Division Multiple<br>
Access (TDMA) communication system, a Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)<br>
communication system, or an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDM)<br>
communication system.<br>
When communication system 200 is operating in a soft-handoff mode, a first<br>
plurality of frames transmitted by MS 202 is received by each BTS of the multiple BTSs<br>
206-208 in the active set of the MS via a respective reverse link 224, 234, 244. Each<br>
BTS of the multiple BTSs 206-208 then forwards to controller 212 the plurality of frames<br>
received by the BTS and further forwards one or more quality indicators that indicates a<br>
quality of the received plurality of frames.<br>
The one or more quality indicators forwarded by each BTS 206-208 are based on<br>
a reverse link quality metric mat may be determined by the BTS on frame-by-frame basis<br>
or may be determined with respect to the plurality of frames. For example, the reverse<br>
link quality metric may be a frame error rate (FER) that is determined with respect to the<br>
plurality of frames, or may be based on a bit error rate (BER), a signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR), a signal strength, a carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR), or an Eb/Io ratio (energy per<br>
bit/interference power density (per Hertz)) that is determined with respect to one or more<br><br>
of the plurality of frames. Those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that many<br>
quality metrics are known and may be used herein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The quality indicator may then comprise the reverse link quality metric or may be<br>
an indicator representative of the reverse link quality metric. For example, a BTS may<br>
determine, with respect to each frame and based on the frame quality metric, whether the<br>
received frame is acceptable or erroneous. The BTS embeds a quality indicator in a<br>
header of the frame, which quality indicator indicates whether the frame is acceptable,<br>
mat is, good, or erroneous, that is, erased. The BTS then forwards the frame and the<br>
embedded quality indicator to controller 212.<br>
When controller 212 receives a plurality of frames and an associated one or more<br>
quality indicators from each of the multiple BTSs 206-208, the controller stores the one<br>
or more quality indicators in association with the BTS sourcing the plurality of frames<br>
and/or the reverse link or communication link via which the plurality of frames are<br>
received, in one or more memory devices 216. Upon receiving a same frame from each<br>
of the multiple BTSs 206-208, controller 212 then selects a frame from among the same<br>
frames received from each of the BTSs and forwards the selected frame to MSC 260.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated herein, all functions performed herein by controller 212 are<br>
preferably performed by SDU 214, and in particular by processor 215.<br>
As MS 202 moves through communication system 200, the MS may head towards<br>
a coverage area, or sector, associated with a BTS not in the MS's active set, such as BTS<br>
209, and away from a coverage area, or sector, associated with a BTS in the active set,<br>
such as BTS 206. As MS 202 moves toward BTS 209, a signal strength of a pilot signal<br>
received by MS 202 via a forward link 252 associated with BTS 209 increases until MS<br>
202 identifies the pilot signal from BTS 209 as a viable communication link. In addition,<br>
as MS 102 heads away from BTS 206, a signal strength of a pilot signal received by MS<br>
202 from BTS 206 via forward link 222 associated with BTS 206 deteriorates to the point<br>
that MS 202 determines that communication link 220 is no longer a viable<br>
communication link. At that point, communication system 200 determines whether to<br>
execute a soft-handoff by adding BTS 209, along with associated communication link<br><br>
250, to the active set of MS 202 and dropping BTS 206, along with associated<br>
communication link 220, from the active set of MS 202.<br>
FIG. 3 is a logic flow diagram 300 of steps executed by communication system<br>
200 in determining whether to execute a soft-handoff in accordance with an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 300 begins when MS 202 conveys to the<br>
infrastructure of communication system 200, in particular BSS 204, and the infrastructure<br>
receives (302) from the MS, a request that the communication system add a first BTS,<br>
that is, BTS 209, to the MS's active set and establish a first communication link 250<br>
associated with BTS 209, comprising forward link 252 and a reverse link 254, as an<br>
active communication link for transmitting data to, and receiving data from, MS 202. MS<br>
202 further conveys to infrastructure of communication system 200, in particular BSS<br>
204, and the infrastructure receives (304) from the MS, a request that the communication<br>
system drop a second BTS, that is, BTS 206, of the multiple BTSs 206-208 in the active<br>
set of MS 202 and terminate, or drop, a second communication link associated with the<br>
BTS, that is, communication link 220. Preferably, each of the request to add BTS 209<br>
and/or communication link 250 and the request to drop BTS 206 and/or communication<br>
link 220 is conveyed by MS 202 by use of a Pilot Strength Measurement Message<br>
(PSMM) in which is embedded a request to add or drop the respective BTS and/or<br>
communication link.<br>
In order to ensure that the second communication link 220 is not terminated, or<br>
dropped, as part of an execution of a soft-handoff and replaced by the first<br>
communication link 250 until such time as communication system 200 can confirm that a<br>
new reverse link 254 associated with a BTS 209 that may be added to the active set is of<br>
acceptable quality, controller 212 determines (306) whether to perform a reverse link<br>
analysis prior to adding BTS 209 to the active set of MS 202, that is, whether to evaluate<br>
reverse link 254 associated with BTS 209 prior to adding the BTS to the active set of MS<br>
202.<br>
Controller 212 determines whether to perform a reverse link analysis, or<br>
evaluation, based on a quality of at least one forward link of the forward links 234, 244<br>
associated with BTSs that are members of the active set of MS 202 and that are not under<br><br>
consideration to be dropped. When controller 212 determines not to perform a reverse<br>
link analysis, the controller executes (308) a soft-handoff without first performing a<br>
reverse link analysis. That is, controller 212 adds BTS 209, and associated<br>
communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202 and drops BTS 206, and associated<br>
communication link 220, from the active set of MS 202 without performing a reverse link<br>
analysis. By not performing a reverse link analysis, any delay associated with adding<br>
needed forward link 252 is minimized.<br>
When, at step 306, controller 212 determines to perform a reverse link analysis<br>
prior to performing a soft-handoff, the controller then proceeds to perform (310) a reverse<br>
link analysis. The reverse link analysis comprises evaluating at least one of the reverse<br>
link associated with the BTS under consideration to be added to the active set of MS 202,<br>
that is, reverse link 254 and BTS 209, and the reverse links associated with the BTSs that<br>
will remain in the active set of MS 202 after execution of the soft-handoff, that is, reverse<br>
links 234 and 244 and BTSs 207 and 208. Based on the reverse link analysis, controller<br>
212 then determines (312) whether to add BTS 209, and associated communication link<br>
250, to the active set of MS 202. Logic flow 300 then ends.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a logic flow diagram 400 illustrates a method by which<br>
controller 212 determines, in step 306, whether to perform a reverse link analysis in<br>
accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, logic flow 400 begins when controller 212 determines (402) a<br>
forward link quality metric associated with at least one of a forward link 232, 242<br>
currently in a soft-handoff mode with MS 202 and that will remain in a soft-handoff<br>
mode with the MS in the event that BTS 206 and associated communication link 220 are<br>
dropped from the active set. Controller 212 then compares (404) the determined forward<br>
link quality metric to a forward link quality metric threshold that is stored in the one or<br>
more memory devices 216 of controller 212.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the forward link quality metric may<br>
be an aggregate metric that is based on forward link quality determinations for all of the<br>
forward links 232, 242 currently in a soft-handoff mode with MS 202 and that will<br>
remain in a soft-handoff mode with the MS after a possible dropping of link 220 and an |<br><br>
adding of link 250. For example, controller 212 may determine aggregate signal strengths<br>
for all such forward links 232, 242. Controller 212 then compares the determined<br>
forward link quality metric to an aggregate forward link quality metric threshold.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, controller 212 may determine a<br>
forward link quality metric by determining a quality of each forward link 232, 242<br>
currently in a soft-handoff mode with MS 202 and that will remain in a soft-handoff<br>
mode with the MS after a possible dropping of link 220 and an adding of link 250, and<br>
further determining a best forward link quality from among the multiple determined<br>
forward link qualities. Controller 212 then compares the forward link quality metric, that<br>
is, the best forward link quality, to a forward link quality metric threshold.<br>
Forward link quality metrics are well-known in the art For example, the forward<br>
link quality metric may be a frame error rate (FER) that is determined with respect to the<br>
plurality of frames, or may be based on a bit error rate (BER), a signal-to-noise ratio<br>
(SNR), a signal strength, a carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR), or an Eb/I0 ratio (energy per<br>
bit/interference power density (per Hertz)) that is determined with respect to one or more<br>
of the plurality of frames. Those who are of ordinary skill in the art realize that many<br>
quality metrics are known and may be used herein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, MS 202 may determine a forward<br>
link quality metric with respect to signals received via a forward link 232, 242, and<br>
convey the forward link metric to BSS 204, and in particular controller 212, via any one<br>
or more of the BTSs in the active set of the MS. Controller 212 may then determine a<br>
forward link quality metric based on the forward link quality metric received from MS<br>
202. In another embodiment of the present invention, the MS may make measurements in<br>
regard to a signals received by the MS via a forward link 232, 242, and convey the<br>
measurements to BSS 204, and in particular controller 212, via any one or more of the<br>
BTSs in the active set of the MS. Controller 212 may then determine a forward link<br>
quality metric based on the measurements received from MS 202<br>
When the forward link quality metric compares unfavorably with the forward link<br>
quality metric threshold, for example, when the forward link quality metric is less than<br><br>
the threshold, then the forward links 232, 242 currently in a soft-handoff mode with MS<br>
202 and that will remain in a soft-handoff mode with the MS may be considered to be<br>
weak and a new forward link is needed for the active set. As a result, when controller<br>
212 determines (406) that the forward link quality metric compares unfavorably with the<br>
threshold, controller 212 further determines (408) to execute a soft-handoff without<br>
performing a reverse link analysis. That is, controller 212 adds BTS 209, and associated<br>
communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202 without performing a reverse link<br>
analysis. By not performing a reverse link analysis, any delay associated with adding<br>
needed forward link 254 is minimized. Logic flow 400 then ends.<br>
When the forward link quality metric compares favorably with the forward link<br>
quality metric threshold, then at least one of the forward links 232, 242 currently in soft-<br>
handoff with MS 202 and mat will remain in soft-handoff with the MS may be considered<br>
to be acceptable. As a result, MS 202 may be considered to be capable of maintaining an<br>
acceptable level of communication with the infrastructure of communication system 200<br>
without adding a new forward link, that is, forward link 252. Accordingly, a new forward<br>
link is not urgently needed and communication system 200 may tolerate a delay<br>
associated with performing a reverse link analysis prior to adding the new forward link,<br>
that is, forward link 252. As a result, when controller 212 determines (406) that the<br>
forward link quality metric compares favorably with the forward link quality metric<br>
threshold, controller 212 further determines (410) to perform a reverse link analysis prior<br>
to determining whether to add BTS 209, and associated communication link 250, to the<br>
active set of MS 202. Controller 212 then determines (412) whether to add BTS 209, and<br>
associated communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202 based on the reverse link<br>
analysis. Logic flow 400 then ends.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the method by which controller<br>
212 determines, in step 306, whether to perform a reverse link analysis may further<br>
include the following steps. Prior to determining a forward link quality metric in step<br>
402, controller 212 may determine (414) a quantity of communication links, or forward<br>
links, currently in soft-handoff mode with MS 202, that is, currently engaged in an active<br>
communication with MS 202. Controller 212 then compares (416) the quantity of<br>
communication links, or forward links, to an active link threshold. The active link<br><br>
threshold corresponds to, at the least, a minimum quantity of communication links<br>
desirable for maintaining an acceptable soft-handoff mode of operation between MS 202<br>
and the infrastructure of communication system 200.<br>
When controller 212 determines (418) that the quantity of communication links,<br>
or forward links, is less than the active link threshold, then logic flow diagram 400<br>
proceeds to step 408. That is, when the quantity of communication links, or forward<br>
links, is less than the active link threshold, the addition of new communication link 250,<br>
or forward link 252, to the links in active communication with MS 202 is desirable<br>
regardless of reverse link quality. Controller 212 then determines (408) to add the new<br>
BTS 209, and the associated communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202 without<br>
performing a reverse link analysis.<br>
When controller 212 determines (418) that the quantity of communication links,<br>
or forward links, is equal to or greater than the active link threshold, then logic flow<br>
diagram 400 proceeds to step 402. That is, when the quantity of communication links, or<br>
forward links, is equal to or greater than the active link threshold, the addition of new<br>
communication link 250, or forward link 252, to the links in active communication with<br>
MS 202 may be desirable but is of a lesser importance. Controller 212 then performs a<br>
forward link analysis, that is, steps 402, 404, and 406, in order to determine whether to<br>
perform a reverse link analysis prior to adding the new BTS 209, and the associated<br>
communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a logic flow diagram 500 is illustrated depicting a<br>
method by which controller 212 performs a reverse link analysis in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 500 begins when<br>
communication system 200, and in particular controller 212, receives (502), from MS<br>
202, a request that the communication system add BTS 209 to the active set and/or add<br>
communication link 250. Controller 212 men instructs (504) BTS 209 to decode the<br>
reverse link between the BTS and MS 202, that is, reverse link 254. In response to the<br>
instruction, BTS 209, in particular processor 210 of the BTS, decodes (506) signals<br>
received from MS 202 via reverse link 254. Based on the decoded signals, BTS 209, and<br>
in particular processor 210, determines (508) a reverse link quality metric with respect to<br><br>
the decoded signals. BTS 209, and in particular processor 210, then compares (510) the<br>
reverse link quality metric determined with respect to reverse link 254 to a reverse link<br>
quality metric threshold that is stored in the one or more memory devices 211 of the BTS.<br>
Based on the comparison, BTS 209, and in particular processor 210, then determines<br>
(512) whether the BTS can acceptably decode signals received from MS 202 and so<br>
informs controller 212. Based on whether BTS 209 can acceptably decode signals<br>
received from MS 202, controller 212 then determines (514) whether to add BTS 209 to<br>
the active set of MS 202. Logic flow 500 men ends.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, one or more of steps 508, 510,<br>
512 of logic flow diagram 500 may be distributed among BTS 209 and controller 212.<br>
For example, BTS 209 may make a measurement with respect to a quality of reverse link<br>
254, that is, with respect to signals received via the reverse link, and forward the<br>
measurement to controller 212. The measurement may comprise a reverse link quality<br>
metric, or controller 212 may determine a reverse link quality metric with respect to<br>
reverse link 254 based on the received measurement. Controller 212 may then compare<br>
the reverse link quality metric determined with respect to reverse link 254 to a reverse<br>
link quality metric threshold that is stored in the one or more memory devices 216 of<br>
controller 212 to produce a comparison. Based on the comparison, controller 212 may<br>
determine whether BTS 209 can acceptably decode signals received from MS 202 and,<br>
based on whether the BTS can acceptably decode signals received from MS 202, whether<br>
to add BTS 209 to the active set of MS 202.<br>
For example, BTS 209 or controller 212 may determine the reverse link quality<br>
metric based on one or more quality indicators stored with respect to a predetermined<br>
number of frames received via reverse link 254, such as 120 frames, or stored with<br>
respect to frames received via the reverse link during a predetermined time period. The<br>
predetermined number of frames or the predetermined time period may be maintained in<br>
the one or more memory devices 211 of the BTS or the one or more memory devices 216<br>
of controller 212, whichever is appropriate. When the stored one or more quality<br>
indicators comprises an indication of whether a frame is a good frame or an erased frame,<br>
step 508 may comprise determining, by BTS 209 or controller 212, the reverse link<br>
quality metric by determining a quantity of frames based on the stored quality indicators,<br><br>
such as a quantity of erased frames or a quantity of good frames received via reverse link<br>
224. Step 510 may then comprise comparing, by BTS 209 or controller 212, the<br>
determined quantity of frames to a threshold that is stored in the one or more memory<br>
devices 216 to produce the first comparison.<br>
Step 512 may then comprise the following steps. Based on the comparison, when<br>
the quantity of frames compares unfavorably with the threshold, BTS 209 or controller<br>
212 may determine that reverse link 254 is not a good link. Controller 212 may then<br>
determine not to add BTS 209 and communication link 250. However, when the quantity<br>
of frames compares favorably with the threshold, BTS 209 or controller 212 may<br>
determine that reverse link 254 is an acceptable, or good, link. Controller 212 may then<br>
determine to add BTS 209, and associated communication link 250, to the active set of<br>
MS 202.<br>
For example, when BTS 209 or controller 212 determines, in step 508, a quantity<br>
of erased frames received via reverse link 254 and further determines, in step 510, that the<br>
determined quantity of erased frames exceeds an erased frame threshold, BTS 209 or<br>
controller 212 may determine that reverse link 254 is not a good link. However, if the<br>
determined quantity of erased frames does not exceed the erased frame threshold, then<br>
BTS 209 or controller 212 may determine that reverse link 254 is good link. By way of<br>
another example, when BTS 209 or controller 212 determines, in step 508, a quantity of<br>
good frames received via reverse link 254 and further determines, in step 510, that the<br>
determined quantity of good frames exceeds a good frame threshold, BTS 209 or<br>
controller 212 may determine that reverse link 254 is a good link. However, if the<br>
determined quantity of good frames does not exceed the good frame threshold, then BTS<br>
209 or controller 212 may determine that reverse link 254 is not a good link.<br>
When communication system 200 determines, at step 514, not to add a new BTS,<br>
that is, BTS 209, and an associated communication link, that is communication link 250,<br>
to the active set of MS 202, BTS 209 and/or controller 212 may continue consideration of<br>
BTS 209 and associated communication link 250 and as add candidates and initiate<br>
another add determination. FIG. 6 is a logic flow diagram 600 of steps performed by<br>
communication system 200 in making a subsequent determination of whether add BTS<br><br>
209, and associated communication link 250, to an active set of MS 202 after initially<br>
determining not to add the BTS and communication link in accordance with various<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Logic flow diagram 600 begins when controller<br>
212 determines (602) to not add BTS 209 and/or the associated communication link, that<br>
is, communication link 250 to the active set of MS 202. Subsequent to the determination<br>
to not add the BTS and/or communication link, controller 212 determines (604) a forward<br>
link quality metric associated with at least one of a forward link 232, 242 currently in<br>
soft-handoff with MS 202 and that will remain in soft-handoff with the MS in the event<br>
that BTS 206 and associated communication link 220 may be dropped from the active set,<br>
and a forward link 252 associated with the BTS 209 associated communication link 250<br>
being considered to be added to the active set. Upon expiration of a first time period that<br>
is determined by controller 212 with reference to timer 218, controller 212 compares<br>
(606) the determined forward link quality metric to the forward link quality metric<br>
threshold that is stored in the one or more memory devices 216 of controller 212.<br>
When controller 212 determines (608) that the forward link quality metric<br>
compares unfavorably with the threshold, controller 212 further determines (610) to<br>
execute a soft-handoff without performing a reverse link analysis. That is, controller 212<br>
adds BTS 209, and associated communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202<br>
without performing a reverse link analysis. When controller 212 determines (608) that<br>
the forward link quality metric compares favorably with the forward link quality metric<br>
threshold, controller 212 further determines (612) to perform a reverse link analysis prior<br>
to determining whether to add BTS 209, and associated communication link 250, to the<br>
active set of MS 202. Controller 212 then determines (614) whether to add BTS 209, and<br>
associated communication link 250, to the active set of MS 202 based on the reverse link<br>
analysis. Logic flow diagram 600 then ends.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention as depicted in FIG. 6, wherein<br>
controller 212 continues consideration of BTS 209 and communication link 250 as add<br>
candidates after a determination not to add, instead of making a subsequent determination<br>
of whether to add BST 209 and communication link 250 without receiving a subsequent<br>
drop/add request, controller 212 may prompt (616) MS 202 to convey a drop/add request<br>
upon expiration of a second time period. The second time period is determined by<br><br>
controller 212 with reference to timer 218 and may or may not be the same as the first<br>
time period. The drop/add request indicates a desire of the MS to either add or not add<br>
BTS 209 and communication link 250 to the active set of MS 202. Preferably, controller<br>
212 prompts MS 202 for the drop/add request by conveying a Pilot Measurement Request<br>
Order (PMRO) to the MS.<br>
In response to receiving the prompt, MS 202 conveys to controller 212, and<br>
controller 212 receives (618) from the MS, a drop/add request that indicates a desire to<br>
either add or not add BTS 209 and communication link 250 to the active set of MS 202.<br>
Preferably, the drop/add request comprises a PSMM message in which the MS embeds an<br>
indication of whether to add or not add the BTS and communication link. When the<br>
drop/add request indicates a desire to add BTS 209 and communication link 250,<br>
controller 212 compares (620) the determined forward link quality metric to the forward<br>
link quality metric threshold that is stored in the one or more memory devices 216 of<br>
controller 212 and logic flow diagram 600 proceeds to step 608.<br>
In summarizing, in order to ensure that, during a soft-handoff, that a BTS 209<br>
with an acceptable quality reverse link 254 is being added to an active set of MS 202<br>
before dropping a communication link 220, communication system 200 may perform an<br>
analysis of the reverse link 254 being added. However, before performing the reverse<br>
link analysis, communication system 200 first determines that the communication system<br>
can tolerate any delay associated with performing the reverse link analysis, or that a<br>
reverse link analysis is desired, by performing a forward link analysis. When<br>
communication system 200 determines that communication system cannot tolerate any<br>
delay associated with performing the reverse link analysis and/or that a reverse link<br>
analysis is not desired, the communication system adds BTS 209 and associated<br>
communication links 250 and 254 without performing a reverse link analysis. When<br>
communication system 200 determines that the communication system can tolerate a<br>
delay associated with performing the reverse link analysis and/or that a reverse link<br>
analysis is desired, the communication system performs an analysis of reverse link 254<br>
and, based on the reverse link analysis, determines whether to add BTS 209, and the<br>
communication links associated with the BTS, to the active set of MS 202. Upon<br>
determining to not add BTS 209 to the active set, communication system 200 may further<br><br>
monitor the forward links associated with MS 202 to determine whether to re-consider<br>
adding BTS 209, and the communication links associated with the BTS, to the active set.<br>

is a member of the active set of the mobile station based on the new<br>
comparison.<br><br>
When performing a soft-handoff, a communication system (200) determines whether<br>
to engage in an analysis of a reverse link (254) associated with a base station (209)<br>
under consideration to be added to an active set of a mobile station (MS) (202).<br>
Upon determining not to analyze the reverse link, the communication system adds<br>
the base station to the active set without evaluating the associated reverse link.<br>
Upon determining to engage in a reverse link analysis, the communication system<br>
evaluates the reverse link in order to assure that a communication link (220) is not<br>
terminated, or dropped, as part of the soft-handoff until such time as the<br>
communication system may confirm that an acceptable quality reverse link is being<br>
added. The communication system then determines whether to add the base station<br>
to the active set based upon the evaluation.</td>
