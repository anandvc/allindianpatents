				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present  invention  relates  to an improved      process   for • <br><br>
manufacturing Portland cement using Gamheo  TUST from paper mills. More precisely, this invention relates to a process for producing ordinary Portland cement (DPC) by the black meal process using bamboo dust obtained as waste in the paper mills as a fuel and a raw material.<br>
Portland cement, the most common construction material, is made by grinding Portland cement clinker with a small quantity of gypsum. The clinkers are produced by burning a well proportioned and homogenized mixture containing calcareous (lime containing like limestone) and argillaceous silica, materials (alumina containing like clay) at high temperature of around 1500 degree Celsius.During the course of heating, the materials undergo drying, dehydroxylation, decarbonation etc. reactions forming the acidic and basic oxides which subsequently react at high temperature to form the various clinker constituents (phases). The silicates are the major constituents of the clinker. The di and tricalcium silicates together account for about 70 7% of the clinker and these are responsible for the strength charactristics of the cement. The tricalcium silicate phase is responsible for the initial strength characteristics of the cement and its formation takes place at about 13OO degree Celsius temperature. Cement clinkerization is therefore highly energy intensive. Fuel accounts for a major cost of the cement. In general, the fuel requirement for manufacturing cement by the^i<br>
shaft  kiln  technology is around 1OOO k.cal/kg  of  clinker. Cement  clinkerization is done either in rotary or  in  shaft kiln.  Large  scale cement manufacturing is usually  done  by the  rotary  kiln technology. Such technology  require  large limestone  deposits and assured markets. Coal, oil, gas  etc. are  the common fuels for the rotary kiln.  The  rotary  kiln however  is considered to be a versatile incinerator and  any type  of low grade fuel or combustible waste may be  used  as fuel  as reported by S C Ahluwalia and C H Page,  in  the article  'Effect of low grade fuels, combustible  wastes  and non traditional raw materials, published in the  Proceedings, 9th  International Congress on the Chemistry of  Cement,  New Delhi, 1992, Vol.1, pages 83-124.<br>
The shaft kiln technology is ideally suited for manufacturing cement in small scale. The technology is based on the black meal process, wherein, the fuel is intermixed with the raw material and therefore the generated ash also takes part in the clinkerization process. The commonly used fuel for the shaft kiln technology is low volatile breese coke obtained as a bye product in the coke ovens of steel plants. Since coke ovens are localized, its availability and cost in some places are becoming scarce and high.<br>
Accordingly, there is a growing interest in developing processes for manufacturing cement by the black meal process by substituting a part or the entire amount of the conventional fuel coke breeze by alternative material.<br>
In  countries like India, huge amounts of  biomass  are generated as waste in the fields and factories. These biomass contain   various  amount  of  carbonaceous  materials   like cellulose,  hemicellulose, lignin, pentosan, resin,  wax  oil etc. The calorific values of the biomass rich in ash is  low, whilst,  those  rich  in  oils,  resins,  waxes   are  high. Therefore,  lignocellulosic  materials may be thought  of  as fuel  for  producing  cement clinker in the  shaft  kiln.  In general, unlike the coke breeze, these materials are rich  in volatile matter and their  calorific values are less than the coke breeze. The ash content and physicochemical  characteristics of the ash also varies from source to source. Rice husk obtained  as  waste material in the rice  milling  industries having calorific value of around 3OOO K.Cal/Kg, on combustion generate about 17-25 54 of its weight as ash and around 90'/, of the  ash is silica, which is highly reactive. The  husk  have been  described as a good source of fuel and a  raw  material for  making  Portland  cement of  various characteristics  as described in Indian Patent No.172587 by K C Misra, D Bordoloi and  P C Borthakur, Indian Patent Application Nos  993/Del/94 and 994/Del/92 by P Barkakati,D Bordoloi,A C Baruah,U C Borah and  P C Borthakur. Literature reports on use of  lignocellulosic materials other than that of the rice husk as source of fuel  and raw material in black meal process of cement  manufacturing is not available.<br>
Bamboo,  soft  wood  etc. are used as  the  most  common pulping  material for manufacture of paper in India and  many other   countries.   Processing  of   these   materials   for preparation of the pulp generate huge amount of wastes in the form of dust, chips etc. The quantity generated is  enormous. On an average, a bamboo based paper mill producing around 30O tonnes  of paper/day generates around 25-30 metric tonnes  of bamboo dust.  The common practice of disposal is to transport and  dump the waste in open places nearer to the  paper mill and  burn  the same. The calorific value of  the  waste  over .£4000  K.cal/kg) are thus wasted. The ash content  of  bamboo dust  is  relatively  small,(about  1OX  by  weight)  and  is comprised  of  silica,  and  small to  traces  of  oxides  of aluminium,  iron, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium  etc. The  silica content is relatively small and alkli content  is high.  The  cumulative deposits of the  generated  ash  cause concern for disposal and associated pollution.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for obtaining Portland cement by the black meal process utilising bamboo dust as a fuel and a raw material. Another object of the present invention is to develop a method of producing Portland cement at a relatively low temperature ideal for implementation at a small scale, using bamboo waste as a fuel and a raw material. Still another object of the present invention is to conserve nonrenewable fossil fuels like coal, petroleum etc. usually used as the source of fuel in cement manufacturing. Yet another object of<br><br>
the present invention is to utilize bamboo dust, a waste from the<br><br>
paper  mills,    for   useful   purposes   and   eliminate   the   problems associated with it's disposal.<br>
Accordingly,    the   present   invention   provides   an   improved<br><br>
•process for manufacturing Portland cement using Gamheo tust  which comprises of pulverising separately limestone, clay, coke or coal to a fineness of 90 micron or below and bamboo dust to a fineness of 150 micron or below, mixing and homogenizing throughly, 65 - 75 wt % of the ground limestone, 10<br>
-	16 wt % of ground clay 4 - 10.5 % by wt. of ground coke or coal<br>
and 1.5 - 8 wt % of the finely ground bamboo dust, mixing with 10<br>
-	15 % by weight of water pelletizing the said mixture in the<br>
form of pellet by known procedures, firing the said pellets in<br>
the range of 1200 - 1450 °C under air blast followed by cooling<br>
the resultant clinker to ambient temperature by blowing ambient<br>
air, grinding the clinker with 4 - 5 % of gypsum to obtain the<br>
desired portland cement.<br>
The essential steps of the process of the present invention consist in separately grinding or Pulverising limestone, clay and coke or coal to a fineness in the range of 80-100 micron size and bamboo waste to a fineness of 150 micron size or below, mixing and homogenizing 50 -70 wt.% of ground limestone, 4 to 10 wt.% of ground clay and 4 to 12 wt.% of pulverized coal or coke and 2 to 10% by weight of ground bamboo and then agglomerating the mixture in the form of nodules of 8-12 mm diameter by known methods in a disc type nodulizer using water in the range of 10 - 15 % by wt. of the mixture and then igniting the agglomerates in a vertical shaft kiln at temperatures in the range of 1200-1450 deg. Celsius by known methods , cooling the resultant clinkers to ambient temperature by blowing air, discharging the clinkers<br><br>
from the kiln followed by grinding the same with 4-5 % by weight of gypsum to a Blaine's surface area of 3000-350O sq.cm/gm to obtain the Portland cement.<br>
