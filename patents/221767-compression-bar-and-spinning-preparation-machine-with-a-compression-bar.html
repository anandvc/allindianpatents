3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Compression Bar and Spinning Preparation Machine with a Compression Bar<br>
The invention relates to a compression bar, which seeks to guide a sliver across the<br>
width of a drafting zone of a drawing frame between both the clamping lines of the<br>
drafting zone. Further, the invention relates to a spinning preparation machine with<br>
such kind of compression bar as well as a procedure for removing fibers and/or<br>
contamination from a drafting zone.<br>
Compression bars are used especially in regulated and non-regulated drawing frames and serve the purpose of guiding so-called floating fibers. These are fibers, which are -for a short while during the transport - clamped neither by the downstream roller pair nor by the upstream roller pair in the drafting zone formed by both these roller pairs. The drafting zone here in most of the cases the main drafting zone, which is formed by a middle roller pair and a delivery roller pair. It is, however, also thinkable, to provide for a compression bar in pre-drafting zone, which is formed by an entry roller pair and the middle roller pair.<br>
However, while deploying a compression bar there is the problem, that especially on its top side fibers and other particles accumulate, which are released from the sliver. The reason for this lies in the fact, that short fibers and dirt, which emanate from the sliver and get whirled up in the main drafting zone, do not leave the drawing frame area and mostly remain on the compression bar or even fall back on the sliver. Both the situations are undesirable, because on the one hand a regular cleaning of the compression bar is necessary and on the other hand the resultant quality of the drawn sliver is impaired due to falling back dirt.<br>
As a solution - in the present state of technology - a suction was recommended by means of a suction channel oriented from top on to the main drafting zone, whereby a higher air volume flow and a higher air speed are achieved. The results achieved through this, however, are less satisfactory.<br>
It is task of this invention, to eliminate the problem of contamination in drafting zones of drawing frames or at least alleviate the same.<br>
According to the invention this task is resolved through the features of independent claims.<br>
2<br><br>
The advantages of the invention can be seen especially in the fact, that flow conditions in the drafting zone are influenced by means of the compression bar, in order to reduce the size and/or number of flow whirls in the drafting zone, which hold fibers and dirt in the drafting zone, and the dead flow zones, which lead to accumulation of fibers and dirt and to achieve a higher transportation of dirt, if necessary, along with the measures<br>
according to the state of technology (suction from top). The two measures as per the invention, i.e. on the one hand application of pressure or suction air by means of compression bar and on the other hand optimized external shaping of the compression bar, can be alternatively deployed or can be implemented jointly in a single compression bar.<br>
In the first aspect of invention the compression bar has at least one connecting device for an external compression or suction source, wherein fibers, dirt and, if necessary also hot air in the drafting zone are removed by compressed air exiting from at least one opening or, are sucked through at least one opening and carried away by the connection device. Herein, in the first variant, compressed air is fed directly in the main drafting zone, whereby<br>
The air flow from the main drafting zone is strengthened.<br>
In a preferred design form at least one hollow section is built-up in the compression bar as hollow space stretching lengthwise. Herein, preferably minimum one opening is planned in a wall of the compression bar, which connects the hollow space with the surrounding. The compression bar thus has a hollow profile and is, therefore, excellently suitable, for undertaking the known fiber orientation as well as for ensuring carriage of fibers and dirt.<br>
Alternatively, at the compression bar a hollow strip functioning as hollow section is fitted in its lengthwise stretch (e.g. pasted), which has on the one side minimum one connecting device and on the other hand minimum one opening. According to an advantageous design form the hollow section has a profile which changes in lengthwise direction. Hereby, a possibly occurring pressure drop due to increasing distance from the connecting device is compensated, especially if the profile of the hollow section tapers off with the increasing distance from the connecting<br>
3<br><br>
device.<br>
According to a further additional or alternative design, on each of the two front sides of the compression bar one each connecting device is provided for, through which compressed air or suction air can be applied.<br>
In stead of a single hollow section several of them can be provided for in the compression bar according to the invention, which, for example, run from a front side up to the center of the compression bar and are separated there from each other through a center wall.<br>
In view of minimum one opening, the same can be built-up preferably round, rectangular or longish (like a slit). It is further preferred, that several neighboring openings are mainly distributed across the width of the drafting zone, so that the removal of fiber and/or dirt is effective to maximum possible extent. The same is applicable for one or more slots.<br>
Mostly, a single opening is preferably oriented in such a way with respect to the drafting zone being cleaned, that an optimum fiber/dirt removal is enabled. In a variant the minimum one opening is oriented upwards - i.e. away from the sliver. In another variant the minimum one opening is oriented against the downstream top roller (in case of a main drafting zone the top delivery roller), so that free flowing fibers occurring even near or in the pendentive can be whirled up and carried away.<br>
Also, for example, two parallel running lengthwise slots can be provided, which can be discontinuous, or several openings can be provided in two or more rows, wherein one row can be oriented against the said roller and the other slotted row can be oriented away from the sliver. Or one row is oriented in the pendentive, which is formed by both the delivery rollers and another row can be oriented against the upper delivery roller. Also it can be provided, that the two or more rows of slots or openings comprise of slots or rows counter arranged crosswise in the length direction.<br>
According to a preferred design of the invention at least two of the openings have different cross section sizes, for implementing optimized flow conditions in the drafting zone. Especially, according to design form with reference to this it has proved to be<br>
4<br><br>
advantageous, if the cross section sizes - at those of some of the openings - decrease from front sides of the compression bar towards the compression bar center. In a suitable design the opening cross sections - in case of consequent circular openings -have for example, starting from outer sides towards compression bar center, diameters from 4 mm, 3.5 mm, 3 mm, 2,5 mm etc..<br>
Further, it is advantageous, if at least some of the openings on their outlet side have a bevel or rounding, since in this way a more homogeneous air distribution in the drafting zone can be implemented and by virtue of this, dead zones can be effectively avoided.<br>
In an advantageous design of the invention based compression bar at least some of the openings run from inside towards outside inclined against the center of the compression bar. Also it is apparent, that a more homogenous air distribution can be maintained in the drafting zone through this measure.<br>
With the advantage, the orientation of at least one opening can be adjusted with respect to the drawing frame, in order to undertake an optimized orientation depending on drawing frame geometry (for example, according to just set clamping line distance of both the roller pairs), type of material to be drawn, delivery speed and related flow conditions in the drafting zone, top roller lagging and/or other parameters. For this purpose the compression bar can have suspension means on the front side to facilitate rotary suspension at the drawing frame.<br>
Further, the blowing-in angle a of at least one opening against the horizontal plane advantageously 0° to 90°, wherein the angle a opens against the downstream rollers. At 0° blowing is done in the pendentive of the delivery rollers, at about 45° against the upper delivery roller and at 90° upwards between the top center and upper delivery roller.<br>
As detailed above, the compression bar can also have at least one suction opening, which connects the surrounding with the hollow section. In this manner fibers and dirt can be carried out at or in the compression bar, wherein it has to be ensured, that no blockage of at least one opening, at least one hollow section and at least one connecting device occurs. At least one suction opening can be preferably oriented on<br>
5<br><br>
the sliver in the drawing frame. In case of several suction openings, these can be oriented to different areas of the drafting zone.<br>
In a further special design the compression bar can be operated as kind of water jet pump. Herein, on applying compressed air in at least one hollow section, air and fibers can be sucked through at least one suction opening at or in the compression bar and can be discharged again through at least one blow opening at or in the compression bar in to the surrounding towards distance from the drafting zone.<br>
According to the second aspect of invention the compression bar is characterized by a profile, which influences the flow conditions in the drafting zone in such a way, that number and/or size of dead flow zones between the top rollers of the drafting zone are reduced as compared with the known compression bars. Through the optimized form of the compression bar in an advantageous manner an increase in air speed is achieved. The whirl points in the drafting zone can be pushed further, or in parts the whirl formations can be entirely avoided. The speed of air, which should carry away dirt from the drafting zone, can be increased and thus the disposal can be improved.<br>
In a design example of an optimized profile formation the compression bar has a surface stretching in lengthwise direction of the compression bar, which is matched with the opposite side peripheral surface of the neighboring, downstream top roller. Herein, especially the said surface of the compression bar of the partial cylinder surface of the top roller can be mostly copied.<br>
A compression bar with an optimized profile form can have another surface provided for contacting with the sliver, which is mostly built from an even surface and can be arranged parallel to the running direction of the sliver.<br>
Alternatively or additionally to the said features the cross section of an advantageous compression bar tapers off in downstream direction, i.e. in running direction of the sliver.<br>
In an advantageous variant the bottom side of the compression bar has a concave camber. Herein, the bottom side runs out preferably in a downstream pointed edge,<br>
6<br><br>
which is visible towards pendentive of both the downstream rollers of the drafting zone. The concave camber has the advantage, that the upstream edge guides the sliver in traditional manner, whereas the cambering has no contact with the sliver and, therefore, does not disturb, while the downstream edge ensures optimized flow conditions between compression bar and upper delivery roller and has hardly any influence on the drawing pattern of the sliver.<br>
For further improvement of the flow situation in the drafting zone the compression bar has no or hardly rounded edge at the top side opposite the sliver side, in order to reduce the dead zone in this area.<br>
Advantageously, the respective cross section of the represented compression bars is<br>
same across their length. A changing cross section is, however, not ruled out.<br>
The invention covers also a spinning preparation machine, especially a drawing frame,<br>
combing machine, combing preparation machine or carding machine, with a drawing<br>
frame, which have at least one drafting zone formed by two roller pairs, wherein the<br>
machine has at least one compression bar as per invention arranged in the drafting<br>
zone.<br>
According to an advantageous improvement the machine has a device for setting the height of the compressed air application, in order to be able to accurately set the fiber-/dirt removal. Herein the height of the compressed air application can be advantageously adjustable to suit the production speed and/or the degree of contamination of the material under processing.<br>
According to another preferred design of the machine the compression bar with respect to the middle rollers is arranged in the main drafting zone in such a way, that it get moved along, with the change of the drawing zone width, but retaining the same distance to this middle roller. For example, the compression bar is coupled here with the punching of the upper middle roller.<br>
Further, it is preferred, if a suction device above the drafting zone is provided for, which helps carrying away of fiber waste and/or dirt originating from the drafting zone, which s whirled up by means of invention based compression bar and is transported in the<br>
7<br><br>
direction of suction device.<br>
Object of invention is also a procedure for removal of fibers and/or dirt from a drafting zone of a drawing frame with the help of invention based compression bar described earlier.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are characterized by the features<br>
of the sub-claims.<br>

In Figure 1 a schematic side view of a drawing frame is shown as example for a spinning machine (here to be precise: spinning preparation machine). According to this<br>
example several mainly reversed slivers FB (only these are shown here from top) of the drawing frame are placed next to each other. It is also possible, to feed only one sliver FB to the drawing frame, which is placed directly by an in-line carding or combing machine. At the entrance of the drawing frame a funnel 12 is arranged, which compresses the slivers FB. Alternatively, other compression devices can be used. After running through a scanning device 2, 3 as part of an entry sensor the now compressed sliver FB'; consisting of several individual slivers, is guided in a drawing frame 4, which forms the core of the drawing arrangement. The drawing frame 4 has normally drafting elements or roller pairs, between which the actual drafting takes place. These are the entry roller pair 5a, 5b, the middle roller pair 6a, 6b and the exit or also called delivery roller pair 7a, 7b, which rotate in this sequence at increased rounds per minute. Through these varying rotation speeds of the roller pairs the sliver FB', which is spread in the drawing frame like spun yarn, is drawn in proportion to the rotation speeds. The entry roller pair 5a, 5b and the middle roller pair 6a, 6b form the so-called pre-drafting zone VF, the middle roller pair 6a, 6b and the delivery roller pair 7a, 7b form the so-called main drafting zone HF.<br>
In the main drafting zone there is another compression bar 20, which deflects the sliver FB' and thus ensures a better guiding of the fibers, especially of those fibers not<br>
clamped between two roller pairs (so-called floating fibers). The drawn sliver FB' is compiled by means of a deflecting roller 9 and a sliver forming device 10 and is placed with a speed VL in a can 18 via a calendar roller pair 13, 14 and a oscillating sliver channel 16, which is arranged in a rotary disc 17 rotating at angular speed co.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show two different computer based flow simulations in the main drafting zone HF, wherein in Figure 2 a compression bar 20 with a circular shaped cross section has been shown. It is shown, that before the compression bar 20 a dead zone (i.e. there are hardly any flow lines) is formed, where dirt particles can accumulate on the compression bar 20. in standard compression bar 20 as per Figure 3 with an oval cross<br>
9<br><br>
section although this dead zone does occur, however, it less prominent, since the gap between middle top roller 6b and compression bar 20 is only about 2 mm.<br>
From the simulations it becomes apparent, that the profile form of the compression bar 20 has a great influence on the formation of air whirls (closed lines). Through an<br>
improved form of the compression bar 20 the whirl points can be pushed or partly the whirl formations can be avoided. Also the speed of the air, which should transport the dirt from the drafting zone, is increased by means of an optimized compression bar and thus the removal is improved.<br>
In case of invention based compression bars 20 shown in the Figures 4 and 5 the upper rounding of the oval standard compression bar (refer Figure 3) is replaced through an edge 21 of two compression bar walls vertically joining above each other. As the flow simulations show, in this way the referred dead zone can be almost eliminated.<br>
A whirl formation occurs on the downstream side of the compression bar 20 and that is in the immediate proximity of the sliver FB'. This whirl occurs in all the three compression bars according to Figures 2, 3 and 4 (refer Marking in Figure 4). Here as per the invention the solution is provided by the fact, that the bottom side 22 of the compression bar 20 as per Figure 5 stretches itself near to the pendentive Z, which is formed by both the rollers 7a, 7b and it runs out into the edge 26 slightly bent upwards and rounded against the pendentive Z. By means of this design the whirl at the sliver FB' can be effectively restricted, so that the dirt free flowing in the main draft can be carried away by the return flow from the pendentive area and from the main drafting zone HF. This is achieved through equally long stretched surface 24 near the top roller 7b, which represents a guiding of fibers and dirt from the main drafting zone HF.<br>
In the Figures 6-15 compression bars 20 are represented, which can be impacted together by compressed air. The compression bar 20 shown in the Figure 6, which is shown more precisely in Figure 8, has - like the traditional compression bar (refer Figure 3) - an oval outer cross section with a hollow section 30, which stretches itself inside of the compression bar 20 across its entire length. According to the invention, at the top side of the compression bar 20 an opening 40 is provided, which is built up as a<br>
slot according to the Figure 7.<br>
10<br><br>
Further, from the plane view of Figure 7 it can be seen, that on both the front sides of the compression bar 20 one each of connecting devices 29 has been provided, to each of which a compressed air source 90 is connected. Through merely schematically represented device 91 the intensity of the compressed air flow can be set (connection<br>
between this device 91 and the other compressed air source has not been shown for reasons of simplification). Also a single source of compressed air 90 can be provided for both the connecting devices 29. Further, it is possible, that only on a front side of the compression bar 20 a connecting device 29 is provided.<br>
From the compressed air sources 90 compressed air reaches via the connecting<br>
devices 29 in the hollow section 30 and from there through the opening 40 in the outer surrounding in the main drafting zone HF. There the compressed air carries along fibers, dirt and heat from the main drafting zone HV upwards.<br>
Above the drawing frame 4 a traditional suction device 80 is arranged, which carries away fibers, dirt and heat from the drawing frame area (refer Arrow f1). The invention based design of the compression bar 20 conveys fibers, dirt and heat effectively to the suction device 80<br>
In the design form according to Figure 9 another opening 50 is provided, which can facilitate the compression bar 20 to function like a water jet pump. The compressed air is guided like in case of compression bar according to Figure 8 in the hollow section 30 and is guided via the opening 40 towards outside. The hollow section 30 is designed in such a way, that air is sucked from the pendentive area through the opening 50 and it similarly escapes through the opening 40 upwards in the compression bar 20.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show the results of a flow simulation with a hollow round compression bar 20 with air blow directed vertically upwards in the main drafting zone HF, wherein the compressed air in Figure 10 is switched off and switched on in Figure 11. As can be seen from Figure 10 - like in the Figure 2 - a few whirls and dead zones are formed around the compression bar 20. Also without air blow-in in the area between top middle and delivery roller 6b, 7b a dead zone is formed (refer marking), which is further facilitated through the normally present cleaning bars 60 (for cleaning<br>
11<br><br>
of top roller coats). The particles emanating from the sliver FB' remain in this dead<br>
zone and settle themselves on the cleaning bars 60. It can be noted, that the experimental investigations and simulations were carried out without a suction device arranged above the drawing frame (although this is present normally in all frames). It<br>
is, therefore, at least questionable, whether a suction would be sufficient, to overcome<br>
the dead zone, which occurs without air blowing between the cleaning bars.<br>
In contrast, in Figure 11 it can be noticed, how the dead zone in reference is removed, since the air speed clearly increases in the gap between top middle and delivery roller 6b, 7b and fibers and dust particles, which get into the feeding air flow, which carries upwards, are separated with high probability. This is shown in detail in Figure 12. A taper blow direction in the drafting zone HF, as shown in Figure 13, and thus a direct flooding of marginal layer of the upper delivery roller 7b can also improve the dirt separation, since more particles can be covered by the air flow. Here, it is to be ensured, that by changing the blow angle, as far as possible, no fresh dead zone emerges, where dirt can settle down on the compression bar 20.<br>
As an advantage the compression bar 20 is suspended in such a way (for example through suitable suspension at the connecting devices 29, (refer Figure 7), that the blow-in angle can be adjusted.<br>
Like it is clear from Figure 11 to 13, on blowing-in the air in the main drafting zone HF the compression bar 20 and the cleaning bars 60 remain clean. If air is blown-in via the hollow compression bar 20 in the main drafting zone HF, no dead zone is formed. The particles are carried away by the air flow. The cleaning bar 60 for the upper middle roller 6b (refer Figure 11) is washed by air flow, and no dust particles can settle down. The drawing frame remains clean. This air flow can facilitate he dirt transport with a drawing frame suction.<br>
Like the results of flow simulations show on the basis of Figures 2-5 and 10-13, the air flow can be improved through the geometric design of the compression bar 20 as well as through air feeding in the drafting zone HF by means of the compression bar 20. A compression bar 20 optimized according to flow technical aspects avoids maximum possible dead zones in the entire flow area. Figure 14 shows a suitable compression<br>
12<br><br>
bar design. The long shape of this compression bar 20 and especially its long bottom side 22 reduce the whirl formation directly above the fiber material. The outlet flow direction of the compressed air is inclined and is directed against the upper delivery roller 7b. Further, the surface 24 near the upper delivery roller 7b is mostly matched with its semi-circular cross section. Overall, a directed air flow emerges, which facilitates the particle separation. The blowing-in of air in the drafting zone HF increases the flooding speed and improves the consequential property of particles. The formation of dead zones at locations is avoided, where dirt particles can settle.<br>
In Figure 15 different cross sections and the respective front view for an invention based compression bar 20 have been shown. The compression bars 20 have been shown in the same position like in the earlier figures. In the design forms a), c), e) and f) of Figure 15 air (indicated by arrows) in a blowing angle a, which is here about 45° with respect to the horizontal plane,<br>
Is brought in through several openings located next to each other in the main rafting zone HF. Herein especially the upper delivery roller 7b is flooded. As against this, in the design form b) the blow-in angle is 90°, whereas in the design form d) an additional horizontally oriented blow-in follows through several openings 41 located next to each other.<br>
Only for the design form a) it is represented, that the openings 40 can be built-up differently. In the representation on the left side there are seven there are seven round openings 40 located next to each other, whereas in the design form 3 shown on the right elongated slots 40 are foreseen. Also it is naturally possible, to provide merely elongated opening (refer Figure 7). These alternatives are not shown in the design forms b)-f) of Figure 15 for the sake of simplification.<br>
Whereas in the design form a) the upper edge is rounded, the edge in case of design forms b)-f) runs pointed, which - as described above - is beneficial from flow technical point of view.<br>
Further, the bottom sides of the compression bars according to design forms c), d) and<br>
f) have a concave camber 23, which preferably stretches itself across the entire length<br>
13<br><br>
of the compression bar 20. (it may be pointed out here, that all represented compression bars have preferably the same cross section across their entire length.) As against this the compression bar 20 according to e) has a horizontally running bottom side 22. The camber 23 offers the advantage, that on the one hand a longer compression bar shape is retained, wherein the advantages discussed in the context of the design form of<br>
Figure 5 of a better flow profile are achieved. On the other hand it is achieved, that the actual zone of the main draft - due to concave camber 23 - is not reduced, which otherwise could have disadvantages from textile engineering point of view. The actual function of the compression bar 20 takes over the upstream edge 25 at the bottom side 22 of the compression bar 20. the downstream edge 26 serves, as against this, for profiling of the compression bar 20 directed towards the pendentive of the delivery roller pair 7a, 7b.<br>
In Figure 16 another design form of an invention based compression bar 20 - like in Figure 15 for sake of simplification without reproduction of connecting devices - has been shown in lengthwise cut. On its top side several openings 40 having cross section reducing towards compression bar center have been provided. Further, the openings 40 always run from inside to outside a inclined towards compression bar. As further feature, each of the exit sides of openings 40 directed outwards (towards the drafting zone) has one bevel 44. the above said measures have proved themselves to be advantageous for achieving a homogeneous air distribution (air flow indicated by arrows) in the drafting zone and thus for more effective prevention of dead zones and improved removal of fibers and other particle and, if necessary, heated air from the drafting zone. The above said features of the design example according to Figure 16 can be implemented also individually in an invention based compression bar. The cross section of the compression bar 20 according to Figure 16 can be built-up according to different design examples in the rest of the figures.<br>
The compression bars 20 described in various figures can be integrated in an invention based spinning preparation machine (in the pre and/or main drafting zone), but can also be covered by the invention as individual components, especially spares.<br>
