Papillomaviruses (PVs) belong to the taxonomic family Papiliomaviridae, which are small, non-enveloped, double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. These viruses infect a wide range of higher vertebrates and are highly species-specific. Upon infection, human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have a particular tropism for undifferentiated squamous epithelial cells and apart from being associated with plantar warts, fiat warts, and genital warts (condyloma acuminata), HPV infections are also linked to a disease called epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a rare lifelong disease characterized by disseminating papillomas. There has, furthermore, been an epidemiological and biochemical link of certain papillomavirus isolates with urogenital cancers, including cervical, vulvar, penile cancer, and malignant transformation of epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions. Of the characterized HPV types, about 27 have been identified as the causal agents of anogenital infections. HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35 and 42<br><br>
have been identified as being the most prevalent, whereas types 16, 18, 31, 33, 51 and 54 have been associated with anogenital carcinomas, believed to be of high risk, more particularly HPV-16 has been found in 95% of cervical cancers.<br>
Until recently it was believed that high-risk genital HPVs were only transmitted during sexual intercourse, however studies indicate that infants acquire high-risk HPV infections from their mothers at birth. In addition to non-sexual parent-to-child transmission, investigators detected HPV DNA in vaginal swabs from women, in cervical-vaginal specimens from young girls, and in vulval swabs from 9 out of 61 women who claimed no history of sexual contact.<br>
Initial HPV infection causes cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), more commonly known as pre-cancerous lesions. It has been found that in some women there is a spontaneous regression of CIN, but this is not always the case and lesions can persist for years, increasing the likelihood of progression towards cervical cancer.<br>
Treatment methods ranging from cryotherapy, surgical excision and topical treatments do not often alleviate problems and for patients who do respond to the treatment, recurrence is often a problem. Ultimate destruction of all infected tissue does not appear to be feasible, since multifocal disease and latency are common features of the infections. Antiviral drugs designed to target and arrest viral replication seem to be ineffective in the case of HPV infections, firstly because the virus does not replicate in the cells that maintain the infection and secondly due to the fact that viral replication genes seem to get lost through integration, rearrangement and deletions.<br>
Traditionally most prophylactic vaccines have consisted of live, attenuated virus or formalin-inactivated virus. Due to the difficulties and risks involved in generating large quantities of these traditional vaccines there has been great emphasis on developing a viral protein subunit vaccine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The methods for preparing recombinant proteins and extracting said proteins are known to those skilled in the art and will not be developed in depth in the present description.<br>
HPV 16 L1 genes<br>
Two different L1 genes were used for this study, SA-L1 and SAopt-L1. The amino acid (AA) sequence of these varied from the prototype sequence published by Seedoft et al. (1985) as outlined in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Amino acid differences of the variant HPV L.1 genes<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
SA-L1 was optimised by site directed mutagenesis following the results published by Touze et al, 1998.<br>
With the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) having been identified (Zhou et al., 1991), L1 genes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified without the nuclear localisation signal (last 21 Ms) for the L1 genes.<br>
Cloning of the cienes into TMV pBSG 1057 vector<br>
All the L1 genes (including the NLS-) were cloned into pGEM-T easy plasmid with Pacl and Xhol restriction sites (at 5' and 3' respectively) having been introduced during amplification by PCR. This was done to facilitate the subcloning of this gene fragment after sequencing into the pBSG 1057 vector (Large Scale Biology Corporation).<br>
The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was excised from pBSG1057 by restriction enzyme digestion with Pacl and Xhol, and L1 cloned into the TMV vector between these sites to produce the following constructs:<br>
pBSG-O, pBSG-ON, pBSG-S, pBSG-SN,<br>
R-Rochester isolate<br>
S-South African isolate<br>
O-Optimised South African isolate (Ala =* Thr at AA 266)<br>
N-Without nuclear localisation signal (MLS); AC483<br>
Transcription of pBSG plasmids<br>
mRNA of pBSG-O, pBSG-ON, pBSG-S, pBSG-SN, and pBSG1057 was transcribed using a Ribomax Transcription/translation kit (Promega). Ten micrograms of plasmid DNA was used for each reaction.<br>
Infection of Nicotiana benthamiana with recombinant TMV mRNA<br>
Half of the mRNA (50|ul) was rubbed onto leaves of 3-week old N. benthamiana plants using cotton-wool buds and celite. Plants inoculated with the control pBSG1057 mRNA were monitored daily with a UV light for the appearance of GFP in both inoculated and upper leaves of the plants. Systemic spread of GFP was used as an indicator of systemic spread of recombinant TMV and leaves were sampled from all plants for detection of L1 protein on SDS polyacrylamide gels, for VLPs ("virus-like particles") using EM and mRNA detection using RT-PCR.<br>
Detection of L1 Protein<br>
Crude protein preparations were made by crushing leaves in a mortar and pestle, or using Eppendorf pestles. Loading buffer was added samples and boiled for 10 minutes and run on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels to separate the proteins.<br>
Western blots were also performed on protein transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes from the SDS polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were probed with a mouse D9 monoclonal antibody (ex Christensen) at a dilution of 1:500.<br>
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)<br>
The ELISA plates were coated overnight with the plant derived antigen and washed and blocked with 1% non-fat milk before being probed with anti-VLP monoclonal antibody, V5 for 2 hrs. Following further washing the wells were probed with secondary anti-mouse (alkaline phosphatase labelled) antibody at 37Â°C for an' hour. The binding reactions were detected by colorimetric methods using NBT and BCIP at an optical density of 492nm.<br>
Bulk purification of VLPs from N. benthamiana infected with various recombihant TMV mRNA<br>
The plant leaf material was homogenised in 1:2 volumes (plant material: buffer, w/v) of buffer (for HPV use PBS with 0.5M NaCI) and pressed out through cheesecloth over funnel until pulp dry. The extract was centrifuged for 10 mins at 4Â°C (SOOOrpm). 10% (w/v) PEG (MW 8000) was added to the supernatant and stirred overnight at 4Â°C. This was then centrifuged at SOOOrpm for 10 mins at 4Â°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1/1 Oth the original volume in PBS (0.5M NaCI) overnight at 4Â°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 mins,to remove denatured non-soluble components. The extract was overlaid onto a 40% sucrose cushion (made in PBS with 0.5M NaCI) and centrifuged at 100 000 x g (for SW28, 24 000 rpm) at 10Â°C for 21/2 hrs. The pellet was resuspended in PBS-CsCI (0.4g/ml CsCI) and the suspension was passed through 18 &amp; 26 gauge needles to reduce viscosity. This was spun over night at 10Â°C at 100 000 x g. The TMV band was identified and the rest of material above was extracted and dialysed against PBS (0.5M NaCI). The diaiysed material was spun down at 100 000 x g onto a 40% sucrose cushion and resuspended in a small quantity of PBS (0.5M NaCI) and mixed thoroughly. This suspension was loaded onto a linear sucrose gradient of 20-60% and spun at 100 000 x g (for SW 28, 24 000 rpm) at 10Â°C for 3 hrs. The VLP band observed under scattered light was removed with a needle and syringe and dialysed against PBS (0.5M NaCI) at 4Â°C for 12-24 hrs.<br>
Electron microscope analysis<br>
The VLPs were trapped onto carbon-coated copper grids coated with monoclonal antibody (conformation specific for HPV 16 L1) V5 and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The grids were viewed under the 200CX electron microscope.<br>
Nicotians benthamiana were infected with the RNA transcripts for each of 5 constructs. The plants infected with pBSG1057 was observed daily using a long wavelength UV light to detect the spread of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the site of inoculation. In general green spots were observed three days post inoculation on the inoculated leaves. The GFP was spread systemically on average 8 days post inoculation. The main symptom observed were the slight mosaic pattern on the leaves and the extensive curling of the leaves.<br>
Infected leaf material was used to infect more plants by inoculating leaves with the crushed infected leaf material in water or phosphate buffer.<br>
VLPs were isolated from plants that were infected with TMV constructs expressing the 4 different L1 genes. The VLPs were seen to bind the monoclonal neutralising antibody V5 by ELISA.<br>
The VLPs observed under the electron microscope (trapped or untrapped with antibody) were similar in appearance to those as a result of the same gene expressed In an insect cell system (using baculoviruses), as shown in Figures 8 and 9, respectively (size bar indicates 70 nm). The size of the particles was observed to be approximately 50-60nm in diameter and in crude preparations TMV particles were also observed. In one case (pBSG-SN infected) the necrosis was observed indicating that the L1 gene had been knocked out by TMV.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 10 to 13, a series of micrographs confirm the production of VLPs from plants. The purified plant protein extract was viewed with a JEOL 200CX transmission electron microscope by immunotrapping the particles with J4 and V5 monoclonal antibodies at a dilution of 1/50. J4 binds a linear epitope in region aa 261-280 and V5 binds a conformation-specific epitope.<br>
Immunisation of rabbits with plant produced VLPs<br>
Rabbits were immunised subcutaneous (2 sites) and intramuscular (1 site) with the plant produced VLPs and given a total of three boosters. VLP extracts were concentrated approximately 20 fold from initial concentrations.<br>
The rabbit serum was analysed for VLP specific antibodies by ELISA against baculovirus-produced HPV-16 L1 VLPs (Figure 14) and by western blots (Figure 15).<br>
The crudely-purified HPV-16 VLPs were made from both TMV vector-infected and transgenic plants. The antisera produced reacted with baculovirus-produced VLPs, indicating that plant-produced VLPs are "antigenically appropriate".<br>
The effects of various N- and C-terminal deletions, as well as of a mutation abolishing assembly into VLPs, on the structural and assembly properties of baculovirus-produced HPV-16 L1 protein were investigated. Abolishing the C at aa 428 in L1 results in pentamers which cannot assemble into VLPs, which are highly stable. Deletion of 10 N-terminal, or up to 21 C-terminal amino acids, resulted in pentamers that still bound neutralisation-blocking V5 MAbs. This is an indication that sub-VLP-sized particles may be very useful vaccines for HPV as they may be easier to purify.<br><br>
A number of different constructs of HPV-16 L1 protein and L1 protein lacking a nuclear localisation signal (NLS-, A483) have been expressed in plants via Tobacco mosaic virus vector infection, and" it has been determined that these make T=7 icosahedral particle VLPs, are immunogenic in rabbits upon injection, and appear morphologically identical to VLPs made in a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. Additionally, it has been determined that HPV-16 VLPs made in infected plants bind a monoclonal antibody (MAb V5) which is conformationally specific and blocks neutralising antibody binding. These findings indicate that VLPs made in plants are functionally identical to VLPs made in insect cells. Further, the following constructs have been expressed via recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells, which bind the same conformationally-specific and sequence-specific MAbs as are bound by unaltered L1 protein:<br>
a.	HPV 16 L1 gene lacking the 10 N-terminal codons (AN10),<br>
which assembles into T=1 and also T=7 icosahedral particles;<br>
b.	HPV 16 L1 gene lacking 10 N-terminal codons and NLS<br>
(AN10A483),   which   assembles   into  T=1   and   also   T=7<br>
icosahedral particles;<br>
c.	HPV 16 L1 gene with a C to G mutation (pen) at aa428<br>
(pen504), which assembles into pentamers;<br>
d.	HPV 16 L1 gene with pen and AN10 modifications, which<br>
assembles into pentamers;<br>
e.	HPV 16 L1 gene with pen and A483 modifications, which<br>
assembles into pentamers; and<br>
f.	HPV 16 L1 gene with pen and AN10A483 modifications,<br>
which assembles into pentamers.<br>
It is apparent to one skilled in the art that these constructs could be expressed in TMV vector infected plants and should behave in exactly the same way.<br><br>
It will be immediately apparent to a person skilled in the art that although certain embodiments only of the invention have been set out herein, other modifications and/or variations of the invention are possible. Such modifications and/or variations are to be considered as falling within the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A modified nucleotide sequence set out in any one of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4 or a complement thereof for use in producing virus-like particles of a papillomavirus L1 protein.<br>
2.	A vector comprising the modified nucleotide sequence as claimed in claim 1.<br>
3.	A method of producing virus-like particles of a papillomavirus L1 protein, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) contacting a plant cell with a vector containing a nucleotide sequence set out in any one of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4 or a complement thereof; and<br>
(ii) cultivating the plant cell under conditions suitable for the production of a protein encoded by any one of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4 or a complement thereof, wherein the protein spontaneously assembles into virus-like particles.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the plant cell is a Nicotiana benthamiana plant cell.<br>
5.	A virus-like particle encoded by a modified nucleotide sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs. 1-4 or a complement thereof.<br>
6.	A virus-like particle as claimed in claim 5, which is capable of eliciting an immunogenic response against a papillomavirus.<br><br>
7.        A virus-like particle as claimed in claim 5 or 6, for use in a vaccine for treating or preventing papillomavirus infection in a human.<br>
