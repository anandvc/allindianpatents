FOR SELECTING AN INSERT AS REGARDS ITS MECHANICAL<br>
STRENGTH<br>
The invention relates to a method of selecting a<br>
polymeric insert that has to be chosen for its<br>
mechanical strength qualities and is intended, for<br>
example, to be used in laminated glazing, preferably-<br>
giving the glazing acoustic properties.<br>
The term "polymeric insert" is understood to mean a<br>
monolithic insert or a composite insert consisting of<br>
the assembly of several polymeric elements in the form<br>
of layers, resins or films. Preferably, at least one of<br>
the elements incorporates polyvinyl butyral (PVB).<br>
Laminated glazing is generally intended for fitting<br>
into vehicles or buildings. It has major assets from<br>
the standpoint of its mechanical strength. This is<br>
because, when an impact occurs, before the glass<br>
fractures, the insert advantageously allows some of the<br>
energy to be absorbed by viscous dissipation. The role<br>
of the insert is also paramount since it guarantees to<br>
a great extent the integrity of the structure when the<br>
glass is completely shattered, making it possible,<br>
thanks to the adhesion of the glass fragments to the<br>
film, to prevent glass splinters from being sprayed and<br>
consequently preventing injury to people.<br>
Moreover, it is becoming increasingly desirable, for<br>
better comfort, for the insert to allow the glazing<br>
also to meet acoustic performance criteria so as to<br>
attenuate the perception of airborne and/or solid-borne<br>
noise reaching the passenger compartment via the<br>
glazing.<br>
Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) is widely used for its<br>
mechanical properties. It may also provide the<br>
laminated glazing with acoustic properties when its<br><br>
composition, including in particular its content of<br>
plasticizers, is very suitable.<br>
The insert is selected for providing acoustic<br>
properties using a method of determining the critical<br>
frequency of the laminated glass and its comparison<br>
with the critical frequency of a glass bar. Such a<br>
method is described in patent EP-B-0 100 701; an insert<br>
is regarded as being suitable when a bar 9 cm in length<br>
and 3 cm in width made of a laminated glass, which<br>
comprises two glass sheets 4 mm in thickness joined<br>
together by said insert 2 mm in thickness, has a<br>
critical frequency that differs by at most 35% from<br>
that of a glass bar having the same length and the same<br>
width and a thickness of 4 mm.<br>
 This method of selection, valid for any type of insert<br>
 intended for being incorporated into laminated glazing,<br>
is not only applicable to PVB but also to other<br>
polymeric films.<br>
Now, whether used in PVB-laminated glazing or glazing<br>
laminated with other polymeric films, in combination or<br>
otherwise, so as to obtain "acoustic" glazing, it is<br>
paramount for the insert to meet mechanical strength<br>
criteria.<br>
This is because building or automobile glazing is<br>
required to exhibit excellent response capabilities in<br>
terms of impact protection, such as accidental<br>
collisions, the falling of an object or a person,<br>
vandalism and break-in by throwing objects. Most<br>
glazing in use must at least meet the criteria of<br>
European Standard EN 356 up to Class P2A.<br>
One method of assessing the tear strength of the insert<br>
is known from European patent application EP 1 151 855.<br>
For a given thickness of the insert, the value of the<br><br>
critical energy Jc of the insert, which is<br>
representative of the energy needed to propagate a<br>
crack initiated in the insert, is calculated and if<br>
this value is greater than a reference value the insert<br>
meets the tear strength criterion.<br>
However, the inventors have demonstrated that some<br>
inserts although meeting the tear strength criterion<br>
are, nevertheless, not completely satisfactory from the<br>
mechanical strength standpoint.<br>
Consequently, the object of the invention is to provide<br>
a method of selecting the quality of the mechanical<br>
strength of an insert, optionally one that also<br>
 exhibits acoustic insulation properties, which<br>
completes the existing one described in patent<br>
application EP 1 151 855 so as to completely guarantee<br>
the effectiveness of the insert used for impact<br>
protection.<br>
According to the invention, the method, which consists<br>
in evaluating the tear strength of the insert, is<br>
characterized in that it also consists in evaluating<br>
the adhesion of said insert to at least one glass<br>
substrate.<br>
According to one feature, the tear strength is<br>
evaluated by:<br>
determining the value of the critical energy Jc<br>
of the insert, this value being representative of the<br>
energy needed to propagate a crack initiated in the<br>
insert;<br>
calculating the value of the critical energy<br>
normalized to thickness Jc and defined by the equation<br>
Jc = Jcxe1, e1 being the thickness of the insert; and<br>
comparing Jc with a reference value Jref<br>
representative of a reference insert formed by a PVB<br>
film 0.38 mm in thickness, and equal to 13.3 J/m, the<br><br>
insert meeting the tear strength criterion when<br><br>
According to another feature, the adhesion of the<br>
insert is evaluated by twisting a specimen of the<br>
insert fastened to two glass substrates, by measuring<br>
the value of the torsional force or torque for which<br>
the separation of the insert from at least one of the<br>
substrates is initiated, by calculating the shear<br>
strength x from this value and by comparing this value<br>
with a warning value established for a reference insert<br>
formed from PVB.<br>
According to another feature, the mechanical strength<br>
of the reference insert with respect to its thickness<br>
is mathematically in the form of an approximately<br>
parabolic function defined by the critical energy Jc as<br>
a function of the adhesive strength τ. The insert whose<br>
mechanical strength is to be evaluated meets the tear<br>
and adhesive strength criteria when, after evaluating<br>
the critical energy and adhesive strength values, these<br>
values lie within the parabolic curve that has a<br>
minimum corresponding to a value of the critical energy<br>
Jc equal to 17,500 J/m2.<br>
The insert is selected when, at a temperature of 20°C,<br>
its critical energy value is greater than 17,500 J/m2<br>
and its shear strength x is between 3.8 and 6.9 MPa.<br>
In particular, the insert is selected when, at a<br>
temperature of 20°C, its critical energy value is<br>
greater than 22,500 J/m2 and its shear strength x is<br>
between 4.8 and 6.1 MPa.<br>
The method according to the invention also consists in<br>
selecting the insert for the acoustic properties given<br>
to the laminated glazing, the insert meeting the<br>
selection of acoustic insulation properties is<br><br>
especially chosen when a bar 9 cm in length and 3 cm in<br>
width made of a laminated glass, which comprises two<br>
glass sheets 4 mm in thickness joined together by said<br>
insert 2 mm in thickness, has a critical frequency<br>
which differs by at most 35% from that of a glass bar<br>
having the same length and the same width and a<br>
thickness of 4 mm.<br>
Preferably, the device which evaluates the shear<br>
strength of an insert is characterized according to the<br>
invention in that it comprises two jaw systems intended<br>
to sandwich a glazing specimen consisting of two glass<br>
substrates and the insert, one of the systems being<br>
fixed while the other is capable of being moved and<br>
rotated, a shaft for rotating the movable-jaw system, a<br>
motor for rotating the shaft, a torque meter placed<br>
between the motor and the movable-jaw system, and a box<br>
that houses the computing elements and includes a<br>
display part on which the value of the strength may be<br>
read.<br>
The invention also relates to a polymeric insert<br>
intended to be incorporated in laminated glazing,<br>
characterized in that it has, at a temperature of 20°C,<br>
a critical energy value of greater than 17,500 J/m2,<br>
preferably greater than 22,500 J/m2, and a shear<br>
strength x of between 3.8 and 6.9 MPa, preferably<br>
between 4.8 and 6.1 MPa.<br>
According to one feature, the insert has a thickness of<br>
at least 0.76 mm.<br>
According to another feature, the insert has a<br>
thickness e equal to at least  , where:<br>
Jc is the critical energy value specific to the<br>
material of the insert and representative of the energy<br>
needed to propagate a crack initiated in the insert;<br><br>
Jref is a reference critical energy value<br>
corresponding to the critical energy value of a<br>
polyvinyl butyral (PVB) film and equal to 35,100 J/m2<br>
for a temperature of 2 0°C and for a stretch rate on the<br>
PVB film of 100 mm/min; and<br>
eref is a reference thickness corresponding to that<br>
of the PVB film and equal to 0.38 mm.<br>
Advantageously, the insert gives acoustic insulation<br>
properties to the laminated glazing for which it is<br>
intended. In particular, it is such that a bar 9 cm in<br>
length and 3 cm in width, made of a laminated glass<br>
comprising two glass sheets 4 mm in thickness joined<br>
together by said insert 2 mm in thickness, has a<br>
critical frequency which differs by at most 35% from<br>
that of a glass bar having the same length and the same<br>
width and a thickness of 4 mm.<br>
The insert comprises one or more polymeric elements,<br>
preferably at least one PVB film.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to laminated glazing<br>
comprising at least two glass sheets and at least one<br>
polymeric insert, especially a PVB-based insert,<br>
characterized in that the insert has, at a temperature<br>
of 20°C, a critical energy value of greater than<br>
17,500 J/m2, preferably greater than 22,500 J/m2, and a<br>
shear strength x of between 3.8 and 6.9 MPa, preferably<br>
between 4.8 and 6.1 MPa.<br>
Advantageously, this glazing is glazing for a vehicle,<br>
comprising two glass sheets each having a thickness of<br>
between 1.2 and 2.5 mm, and an insert joined to the two<br>
glass sheets and having a thickness of at least<br>
0.76 mm.<br>
Preferably, the insert gives this glazing acoustic<br>
insulation properties, that is to say, in particular,<br><br>
the insert is such that a bar 9 cm in length and 3 cm<br>
in width, made of a laminated glass comprising two<br>
glass sheets 4 mm in thickness joined together by said<br>
insert 2 mm in thickness, has a critical frequency<br>
which differs by at most 35% from that of a glass bar<br>
having the same length and the same width and a<br>
thickness of 4 mm.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will<br>

figure 9 illustrates a profile view of one<br>
embodiment of the device for evaluating the adhesion of<br>
the insert to the substrate to which it is joined.<br>
The method of the invention is intended for selecting<br>
an insert as regards its mechanical strength, the<br>
insert being intended to be incorporated into a single<br><br>
or multiple laminated glazing unit, which must<br>
withstand hard impacts (EN 356 standard up to Class<br>
P2A) or soft impacts (EN 12600 standard) . The purpose<br>
of the method is to select without having to evaluate<br>
mechanical strength by a destructive impact effect.<br>
In the example below, it is desired to know whether an<br>
insert is suitable for it to be incorporated into<br>
laminated glazing, such as building or automobile<br>
glazing.<br>
The single laminated glazing shown in figure 1<br>
comprises two glass substrates 10 and 11 between which<br>
is fastened an insert 12.<br>
To select the insert, it is therefore necessary to<br>
evaluate its mechanical strength. The inventors have<br>
demonstrated that two parameters should be evaluated,<br>
namely the tear strength of the insert and the adhesion<br>
of the insert to the substrate to which it is joined.<br>
The tear strength is evaluated on the basis of the test<br>
and calculation method explained in patent application<br>
EP 1 151 855, which we repeat here.<br>
The tear strength of the insert depends on the type of<br>
material of which it is made and on its thickness. It<br>
is characterized by an energy value representative of<br>
the energy needed to propagate a crack initiated in the<br>
material. This energy, called the critical energy Jc,<br>
is different for each type of material and is<br>
independent of the thickness of the film, it being<br>
expressed in J/m2.<br>
The tear strength or critical energy Jc is given in a<br>
known manner by an energy method based on the Rice<br>
integral J, which defines the energy localized at the<br>
root of a crack in a film subjected to very high<br><br>
stresses at the location of a crack. It may be written<br>
in the simplified mathematical form (1) :<br>
  for a given stretch 5 of the<br>
specimen tested which will hereafter be called the<br>
displacement 5, and in which:<br>
e1 is the thickness of the specimen;<br>
a is the length of the crack; and<br>
U is the potential energy of the specimen.<br>
The above method for calculating the crack root energy<br>
J is that developed by Tielking.<br>
The experimental device as illustrated in figure 2 is<br>
the following:<br>
Tensile tests using a tension-compression machine 2 are<br>
carried out on several specimens, for example four<br>
specimens Ex1 to Ex4, of the same material and with the<br>
same surface area of 100 mm (50 mm in length by 20 mm<br>
in width). Each specimen is notched according to the<br>
reference 20 on its sides and perpendicularly to the<br>
tensile force, with a different crack length a for each<br>
specimen Ex1 to Ex4, corresponding to 5, 8, 12 and 15 mm<br>
respectively.<br>
Each specimen Ex is stretched perpendicularly to the<br>
cracks 20 at a stretch rate of 100 mm/rain over a given<br>
stretch length or distance 5 and in an environment in<br>
which the temperature is 2 0°C.<br>
This method is used to establish a curve of variation C<br>
(figure 3) of the crack root energy J as a function of<br>
the displacement 8 undergone by the specimen and to<br>
determine, from this curve, the critical energy Jc for<br>
initiating tearing in the specimen.<br><br>
It is therefore at this critical value Jc that the<br>
material tears and that it is consequently mechanically-<br>
damaged as regards the required mechanical function.<br>
Curve C is obtained from the steps that we explain<br>
below. The specimens here are polyvinyl butyral films<br>
having a thickness of 0.38 mm.<br>
Firstly, for each of these specimens Ex1 to Ex4, curve<br>
C1 (figure 4) representative of the tensile force<br>
exerted on the specimen is plotted as a function of the<br>
displacement 5 undergone by said specimen, which<br>
displacement goes from 0 to 4 0 mm.<br>
From the curves C1 of the specimens, the potential<br>
energy U corresponding to a displacement 5 given as a<br>
function of the increased length a of the crack<br>
relative to its initial length is then deduced. The<br>
potential energy U is measured by calculating the area<br>
A, equivalent to the hatched area shown in figure 4,<br>
under the curve C1 between 0 mm and the given<br>
displacement 5, here 22 mm in the case of the hatched<br>
area and corresponding to specimen Ex4.<br>
Eight displacements 5 from 3 mm to 22 mm were<br>
considered. It is then possible to plot, for each of<br>
the eight displacements, a curve C2 illustrated in<br>
figure 5, representing the potential energy U as a<br>
function of the length a to which the crack has grown.<br>
Curve C2 representative of the potential energy U is a<br>
straight line; consequently, the derivative (∂U / ∂a) ,<br>
formulated in equation (1), of the energy J is in fact<br>
the slope of the line C2 and therefore equal to a<br>
constant. The value of J is calculated by dividing this<br>
constant by the thickness e1 of the specimen.<br><br>
After calculating each of the slopes	corresponding to<br>
the eight displacements, curve	C (figure 3)<br>
representative of the energy J as a	function of the<br>
displacement δ is established.<br>
A video camera, which displays the propagation of the<br>
crack 20, is used to detect at which displacement δC<br>
propagation of the crack in the specimen starts. Using<br>
curve C, the corresponding value of the critical energy<br>
Jc is deduced from this displacement 5C.<br>
This critical value Jc of 35,100 J/m2 in the case of PVB<br>
constitutes the reference value Jref of the energy,<br>
above which any energy value calculated for another<br>
material and according to the method explained above<br>
will be considered to be correct so that this material<br>
is suitable for meeting the mechanical strength<br>
criteria.<br>
Once the specific critical energy value Jc has been<br>
calculated, it is, as already explained above,<br>
normalized with respect to its thickness, Jc (Jc x e1) so<br>
as to be compared with the reference value of PVB equal<br>
to 13.3 J/m and so as to deduce therefrom the suitable<br>
thickness e when the thickness e1 is insufficient.<br>
As regards the adhesion of the insert to the substrate<br>
to which it is joined, this is evaluated in the<br>
following manner.<br>
The adhesion test consists in applying a torsional<br>
force to a specimen of the laminated glazing until<br>
separation of the insert from at least one of the<br>
substrates is initiated.<br>
The test is carried out on a round specimen 30 of<br>
radius r equal to 10 mm by means of a torsion device 3<br>
of known type illustrated in figure 6.<br><br>
The device comprises three jaws 31, 32, 33, a pulley 34<br>
of radius R equal to 100 mm and connected to a drive<br>
chain 35 of vertical axis. The jaws are in the form of<br>
circular arcs each of 120°, so as to clamp the entire<br>
specimen. The surface coating of the jaws is made of a<br>
material mechanically compatible with glass, for<br>
example aluminum, Teflon® or polyethylene.<br>
One of the jaws is kept fixed against a frame 3 6<br>
(figure 7), while another jaw is fixed to the pulley 34<br>
which is intended to rotate in order to exert torsion<br>
on the specimen.<br>
Rotation of the pulley is caused by the displacement of<br>
the chain 34 connected to the pulley. The chain is<br>
pulled at a constant speed of at least 35 to 50 mm/rain.<br>
The force F needed for the onset of debonding of the<br>
insert to appear when the specimen is twisted is<br>
measured using a force sensor.<br>
The shear strength may be calculated therefrom by the<br>
known formula:<br><br>
in which it will be recalled that F is the force needed<br>
for the onset of debonding of the insert to occur, R is<br>
the radius of the pulley and r is the radius of the<br>
specimen.<br>
However, this device is bulky and the tests must<br>
therefore be carried out in the laboratory. It is thus<br>
ill-suited to measurements of the "process indicator"<br>
type on a laminated glazing manufacturing line.<br>
Now, for the manufacture of laminated glazing, although<br>
the composition of the polymeric insert is designed to<br><br>
meet the strength values set by the invention, poor<br>
adhesion of the insert may nevertheless occur in the<br>
finished product because of parameters associated with<br>
the process for manufacturing the glazing.<br>
These may, for example, be the conditions under which<br>
the insert is stored; if the moisture content is not<br>
adequate, the PVB hydroxyl bonds may be altered by<br>
water, which will impair the bonding of the insert to<br>
the glass. Poor adhesion may also be due to poor<br>
washing of the glass and the deposition of ions may<br>
result in hydroxyl consumption. The calendering step<br>
during assembly of the glass and the insert also acts<br>
on the quality of the bonding, the temperature and the<br>
compression forces having to be properly controlled.<br>
Thus, the inventors have developed a measurement device<br>
other than that described above which is advantageously<br>
more compact and easily transportable so as to carry<br>
out measurements during monitoring of the manufacture<br>
close to the manufacturing line so that it becomes<br>
possible to quickly intervene in the process in<br>
response to poor measured strength values. This device<br>
thus constitutes a management tool for assessing the<br>
quality of manufacture of laminated glazing.<br>
Miniaturized to about 60 cm by 20 cm, the device 4<br>
shown in figure 9 comprises two three-jaw systems 4 0<br>
and 41, a rotation shaft 42, a motor 43 for driving the<br>
shaft, a torque meter 44 and a box 45 housing the<br>
computing elements.<br>
The round laminated glazing specimen is intended to be<br>
sandwiched between the two jaw systems 4 0 and 41, one<br>
of the systems 40 being fixed while the other is<br>
capable of being moved and rotated by means of its<br>
connection to the shaft 42. The torque meter is placed<br>
between the motor and the movable-jaw system 41. The<br><br>
rotation speed of the shaft depends on the thickness of<br>
the film. To take an example, for a film 0.76 mm in<br>
thickness, the rotation is around 0.08 revolutions per<br>
minute.<br>
The system 41 rotates and when the measured torque<br>
reverses, the initiation of debonding of the insert has<br>
taken place. The torque meter is connected to the<br>
computing elements of the box 45, which includes a<br>
display part on which the value of the strength x may<br>
be read directly. The adhesion is suitable if this<br>
value lies within the range defined by the invention,<br>
as explained below.<br>
To have a detailed understanding of the scatter in the<br>
value of the strength τ, it is preferred to repeat the<br>
test on several specimens, for example, a minimum<br>
number of 5 specimens, and to calculate an average of<br>
the strength together with its standard deviation.<br>
Finally, the strength value is compared with a warning<br>
range within which any value is appropriate for meeting<br>
the adhesion criterion. The warning range of the<br>
adhesive strength τ is equal to 3.8-6.9 MPa. This<br>
warning range was established from a PVB film which, it<br>
will be recalled, is considered at the present time as<br>
an insert having the highest performance with regard to<br>
mechanical strength for meeting the EN356 standard, in<br>
particular the characterizing Class P2A of a PVB<br>
0.76 mm in thickness.<br>
To make it easier to compare any insert with the<br>
reference insert, which is PVB, the inventors have<br>
demonstrated that the mechanical strength may be<br>
defined by a reference curve representative of the<br>
critical energy Jc as a function of the adhesive<br>
strength, this curve having an approximately parabolic<br>
shape.<br><br>
To take an example, figure 7 shows this curve for a PVB<br>
insert thickness of 0.76 mm. Since the critical energy-<br>
varies according to the thickness, for a 0.76 mm<br>
thickness the reference value of the energy is 17,500<br>
J/m2. Since in this graph the energy is not normalized<br>
with respect to thickness, it is necessary for any<br>
comparison with this curve to test an insert having the<br>
same thickness.<br>
Consequently, the minimum value that a critical energy<br>
must meet corresponds to the minimum of the curve,<br>
namely 17,500 J/m2, and the adhesive strength must lie<br>
within a range centered on the value 5.5 MPa and<br>
broadening with the increasing critical energy value.<br>
Thus, the critical energy and the adhesive strength<br>
values measured on an insert to be tested which lie<br>
inside this parabolic curve mean that the insert tested<br>
is regarded as being satisfactory from the mechanical<br>
strength standpoint.<br>
In order to meet the two criteria - tear strength and<br>
adhesive strength - with acceptable reproducibility,<br>
the insert must have a critical energy Jc of greater<br>
than 17,500 J/m2 and an adhesive strength of between<br>
3.8	and 6.9 MPa. Below 3.8 and above 6.9 MPa in the<br>
case of the adhesive strength, the laminated glass<br>
assembly has too high a probability of poor mechanical<br>
behavior. Between 3.8 and 4.8 and between 6.7 and<br>
6.9	MPa, the insert may be regarded as meeting the<br>
expected mechanical strength, while not being optimum.<br>
For an optimum insert, a region necessarily lying<br>
within the parabola, here the region B, will preferably<br>
be considered. In addition, an insert having a minimum<br>
thickness of 0.76 mm meeting the Class P2A requirements<br>
will be chosen when, preferably, the critical energy Jc<br><br>
is greater than 22,500 J/m2 and the adhesive strength τ<br>
is between 4.8 and 6.1 MPa.<br>
Other ranges of the adhesive strength τ may	be<br>
demonstrated for each type of impact, especially	on<br>
having a relatively low impact energy and with	an<br>
extensive contact area (soft impact).<br>
If it is desired to select an insert for laminated<br>
glazing having both acoustic insulation properties and<br>
mechanical strength, the insert will be firstly chosen<br>
for its acoustic performance. To achieve this, the<br>
reader may refer to the patent EP-B-0 100 701 or patent<br>
application EP 0 844 075 which indicate two selection<br>
technique variants, these also being summarized in the<br>
abovementioned Patent Application EP 1 151 855.<br>
In particular, an insert has acoustic insulation<br>
properties when a bar 9 cm in length and 3 cm in width,<br>
made of laminated glass comprising two glass sheets<br>
4 mm in thickness joined together by said insert 2 mm<br>
in thickness, has a critical frequency which differs by<br>
at most 35% from that of a glass bar having the same<br>
length and the same width and a thickness of 4 mm.<br>
Once the material has been chosen, its adhesion is<br>
evaluated by calculating its shear strength which, if<br>
this lies within the desired range, for example<br>
4.8 - 6.1 MPa for meeting the EN356 standard according<br>
to Class P2A, therefore meets the adhesion criterion.<br>
Finally, its thickness for meeting the mechanical<br>
strength criterion is determined. The thickness e of<br>
the insert must at least be equal to , where:<br><br>
Jc is the critical energy value specific to the<br>
material of the insert and representative of the energy<br>
needed to propagate a crack initiated in the insert;<br><br>
Jref is a reference critical energy value which<br>
corresponds to the critical energy value of a polyvinyl<br>
butyral (PVB) film and equal to 35,100 J/m2 for a<br>
temperature of 20°C and for a stretch rate on the PVB<br>
film of 10 0 mm/min; and<br>
eref is a reference thickness corresponding to<br>
that of the PVB film and equal to 0.38 mm.<br>
The tear strength of the material, which will therefore<br>
be identified directly with the critical energy Jc, is<br>
evaluated only after assessing the acoustic performance<br>
of said material and its adhesion. This is because, for<br>
the purpose of using an insert for laminated glazing<br>
providing acoustic insulation and having to meet the<br>
impact protection standards, the approach adopted by<br>
the invention is to firstly choose the material<br>
suitable for meeting the acoustic insulation criteria<br>
and then to test the adhesion performance of this<br>
material so as to deduce therefrom the thickness e<br>
needed to meet the tear strength criteria.<br>
It should be noted that satisfactory glazing from the<br>
mechanical strength standpoint may comprise a<br>
monolithic insert of thickness e or a plurality of<br>
inserts separated by various substrates, the sum of the<br>
thicknesses of the inserts corresponding to the<br>
calculated thickness e.<br><br>
