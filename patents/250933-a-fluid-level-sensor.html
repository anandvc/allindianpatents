Details of the components used in fuel level sensing<br>
Flange (41)<br>
Instant invention has a guide body (10) fixed to a flange (41), where the flange (41) is provided with integral connector (40). The purpose of the integral connector (40) to ease the routing of the wiring assembly in the assembly fitment. This connector has connection with wires from the PCB (73) of the PCB assembly (70) internally. See figure 4.<br>
Guide body (10):<br>
The guide body (10) comprises float cavity (53); cavities (50, 52) and PCB compartment (54). The float cavity (53) is having point's contacts (51, 55) over its surface at 4 places to have friction free movement of the float (60). These four points will have contact with the float (60) thus reducing the amount of friction, wear and tear due to surface contact of the float (60). See figure 5.<br>
The cavities (52, 50) are to use as suction and return of the fuel. The suction cavity (52) is usually bigger in size compare to the return cavity (50). Having this cavities (52, 50) will have an advantage of not having separate cavities for suction and return of the fuel in fuel tank. This gives advantage of not have fuel leakage due to the separate holes punched for fuel suction and return. This will also eliminate the time required to punch holes and welding to have air tight in the assembly line. The compartment (54) is the place where the PCB is inserted. Guide ribs are provided to fix the PCB (73) (figure 7) in tact. This compartment (54) is made bigger than required to place the PCB assembly<br><br>
(70) to reduce the weight of the guide body (10) and to reduce the material cost. The contour of the body is designed to have flat surface on one side to have pool-proofing method in the flange (41) assembly. The Flange (41) can also have a provision to allow the return and suction of the fuel to the guide body (10) cavities (52, 50). The guide body (10) is made up of Aluminium or plastic or poly acetal like Delrin based on the requirements of the flexi fuel.<br>
Float (60): figure 6<br>
The float (60) is designed to have blind cavity and not a through cavity to fix the iTiagnet(s) (62). This is having an advantage to fix the magnet(s) (62) in the ideal position and more rigid. The float contour is designed to have points contact instead of surface contact with the float cavity (53) to avoid friction/wear in the floating movement. The outer circumference of the float ribs (61) has point contact (63) with the float cavity (53) of the guide body (10). This float (60) is made out of hard rubber sponge using 14 chemical compositions bonding to have compatible with flexi fuel. The composition is varied in such a way that it suits the requirement of the flexi fuel.<br>
Further the guide body (10) is provided with a rubber grommet (06) (see figure 2) at bottom and top to restrict the fuel entry into the compartment (54). In addition the guide body (10) is provided with bottom cover (05) to stop the float (60) movement out side the guide body (10). This bottom cover (05) can have a provision to facilitate the fuel movement in the cavities (52, 50). Further the cavities (52, 50) are provided with filters to avoid entry of foreign materials.<br>
This invention has the advantage that this will allow to calibrate the instrument with much of easy. Early fuel level sensors had the disadvantage that the calibration is done by dipping the instrument in to the fuel which was difficuk and time consuming. Further after calibration the instrument, it has to be cleaned to remove fuel stains. This is an additional burden during manufacturing.<br>
Further the guide body (10) is mounted with flange (41) with a help of a rubber sleeve with serration (80) for robust holding. See figure 8. The entire diameter of the guide body (10) with float (60) is maintained or restricted such that is meets the user needs.<br><br>
Instant invention comprises a suction cavity (52), a return cavity (50) and a float cavity (53). The housing is having a longitudinal axis, where the above said suction cavity (52), return cavity (50) and float cavity (53) are sealed with respect to one another along the longitudinal axis and a float (60) positioned within the float cavity (53) and adapted for movement there along with the help of ribs (61) or grooves. The above said suction (52) and return cavity (50) are substantially parallel to one another and coextensive with one another. The float cavity (53) is substantially parallel to suction cavity (52) and return cavity (50) and is substantially coextensive with suction (52) and return cavity (50). A Flange (41) with integral connector (40) and insert molded terminal. The housing is inserted into the flange (41) rigidly. A Rubber Sleeve introduced in the cavity of the flange (41) where the housing gets inserted. This will helps in robust holding of the housing rigidly within the cavity of the Flange (41). A PCB Assembly (70) positioned within the compartment (54) for sensing the position of the float (60) in the float cavity (53). A set of Reed switches (72) and Resistor (71) are provided which activates the Fuel Level Sensor. A Float Assembly comprises of Magnet (62) for sensing the reed switches (72) and resistors (71). A Grommet (06) is provided at the bottom of the housing to prevent the fuel entry into the cavity in which the PCB Assembly is enclosed. This also comprises of a Bottom Cover (05) to cover the housing at the bottom end and it restricts the fuel entry in to the PCB Cavity area. Float Assembly comprises of Magnet (62) for sensing the reed switches (72) and resistors (71). A Plug is provided to restrict the movement of the float (60) above a certain height from the bottom side. The plug can be provided any were in the float cavity (53) to restrict the float (60) movement to predetermined length of the guide body (10). The float (60) is provided in such a way that only a part of it i.e. the ribs (61) fits within the float cavity (53) and reset remains outside the flat cavity (53).<br>
Instant fluid level sensor works even if it is placed inclined to the fluid level. This works perfectly when fitted at an angle instead of exactly perpendicular to the fluid surface. The angle can go upto 30 from perpendicular and still working fine. In this specification, the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Accordingly, the specification and<br><br>
drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. Figure 9, 10 and 11 shows one of the possible modifications as an example for the flange, the fluid level sensor with the modified flange and guide body i.e. housing of fluid level sensor respectively.<br><br><br>
