				<td>INDOLES AS MODULATORS OF NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLIN RECEPTOR SUBTYPE ALPHA-71<br>
This invention relates to novel indole derivatives having activity in modulation of the a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The invention also relates to the use of the derivatives in treating diseases and conditions mediated by modulation of the a7 nAChR. In addition, the invention relates to compositions containing the derivatives and processes for their preparation.<br>
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), by binding to cholinergic receptors causes the opening of ion channels within the mammalian system. The central nervous system (CNS) contains two types of ACh receptor, muscarinic receptors and nAChRs. nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels containing five subunits (for reviews, see Colquhon et al. (1997) Advances in Pharmacology 39,191-220; Williams et al. (1994) Drug News &amp; Perspectives 7, 205-223; Doherty et al. (1995) Annual reports in Medicinal Chemistry 30, 41-50). The nAChR gene family can be divided into two groups: those coding for 3 subunits and those coding for a subunits (for reviews, see Karlin &amp; Akabas (1995) Neuron 15, 1231-1244; Sargent (1993) Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 16, 403-443). Three of the a subunits, a7, a8 and a9, can form functional receptors when expressed alone and form homooligomeric receptors.<br>
Studies have indicated that neuronal nicotinic receptors play important roles in modulating neurotransmission, cognition, sensory gating, and anxiety (Zarei et al. Neuroscience 1999, 88, 755-764, Frazier et al. J. Neurosci. 1998, 18, 8228-8235, Radcliffe et al. J. Neurosci. 1998, 18, 7075-7083, Minana et al. Neuropharmacology 1998, 37, 847-857, Albuquerque et al. Toxicol. Lett. 1998, 102-103, 211-218, Neubauer, et al. Neurology 1998, 51, 1608-1612, Stevens et al. Psychopharmacology 1998, 136, 320-327, Adler et al. Schizophrenia Bull. 1998, 24, 189-202.); thus, there has been interest in the use of compounds that modulate these receptors for treating CNS diseases.<br>
A role for a7 receptors in the etiology of schizophrenia has been suggested by linkage studies (Freedman et al, Psychopharmacology (2004), 174(1), 54-64) demonstrating an association between the a7 locus and a sensory gating deficit which represents a major schizophrenia endophenotype. Such gating deficits in patients have been transiently reversed by nicotine with a pharmacology consistent with action via a7. In addition in animal models, lesion of forebrain cholinergic afferents or pharmacological blockade of a7 receptors elicits similar sensory gating deficits which are also apparent in in-bred mouse<br>
strains expressing reduced levels of the a7 receptor. Nicotine has been reported to normalise the deficits in both lesioned animals and in-bred mouse strains, again with a pharmacology compatible with activity at the a7 receptor. Pharmacological blockade of a7 receptors has been reported to impair rodent short-term working memory, whilst receptor activation has been reported to enhance performance in the same paradigm, thus implicating a7 receptors as a target for cognitive enhancement.<br>
a7 nAChRs are characterised by their fast activation kinetics and high permeability to Ca2-compared to other subtypes (Delbono et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997, 280, 428-438.) and exhibit rapid desensitization following exposure to agonists. (Castro et al., Neurosci. Lett. 1993, 164, 137-140, Couturier et al., Neuron 1990, 5, 847-856, Alkondon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994, 271, 494-506). Treatment with a7 agonists may therefore be problematic because both acetylcholine and nicotine both show activation followed by blockade and/or desensitisation of the receptor and hence chronic treatment with an agonist may well result in apparent antagonism. In addition, agonists have been shown to exhibit highest affinity for the desensitised state of the receptor and can, thus, mediate receptor desensitisation at concentrations below the threshold for receptor activation (Briggs and McKenna. Neuropharmacology 1998 37,1095-1102).<br>
This problem may be overcome by treatment with a positive allosteric modulator (PAM). PAMs enhance a7 nAChR activation mediated by endogenous or exogenous agonists without activating the receptor in their own right, i.e. in the absence of agonist. A number of PAMs have been reported (Lightfoot et al. Progress in medicinal chemistry 46:131-71, 2008)<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof:<br>

As used herein, a C1-6alkyl substituent is a univalent radical derived by removal of a hydrogen atom from an acyclic C1-6alkane. Such C1-6alkyl substituents include methyl and ethyl, may be straight chain (i.e. n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl) or branched chain (for example, isopropyl, isobutyl, secbutyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl and neopentyl).<br>

It will be appreciated that the present invention is intended to include compounds having any combination of the embodiments defined hereinbefore.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise indicated, the term "substituted" means substituted by one or more defined groups. In the case where groups may be selected from a number of alternative groups, the selected groups may be the same or different.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, the term "independently" means that where more than one substituent is selected from a number of possible substituents, those substituents may be the same or different.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for example, non-toxic acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric,<br>
hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, with carboxylic acids or with organo-sulfonic acids. Examples include the HCI, HBr, HI, sulfate or bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, saccharate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, camsylate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate salts. For reviews on suitable pharmaceutical salts see Berge et al, J. Pharm, Sci., 66,1-19, 1977; P L Gould, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 33 (1986), 201-217; and Bighley et al, Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, Marcel Dekker Inc, New York 1996, Volume 13, page 453-497.<br>
In one embodiment the salt of the compound of formula (I) is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Hereinafter, the compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are also referred to as " the compounds of the invention".<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds defined in the first aspect which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prodrugs". All protected derivatives and prodrugs of compounds defined in the first aspect are included within the scope of the invention. Examples of suitable pro-drugs for the compounds of the present invention are described in Drugs of Today, Volume 19, Number 9,1983, pp 499 - 538 and in Topics in Chemistry, Chapter 31, pp 306 - 316 and in "Design of Prodrugs" by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985, Chapter 1 (the disclosures in which documents are incorporated herein by reference). It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that certain moieties, known to those skilled in the art as "pro-moieties", for example as described by H. Bundgaard in "Design of Prodrugs" (the disclosure in which document is incorporated herein by reference) may be placed on appropriate functionalities when such functionalities are present within the compound defined in the first aspect.<br>
The compounds of the invention are typically in solid form. In the solid state, the compounds of the invention may exist in crystalline or noncrystalline form, or as a mixture thereof. For a compound of the invention in crystalline form, the skilled artisan will appreciate that pharmaceutically acceptable solvates may be formed wherein solvent<br>
molecules are incorporated into the crystalline lattice during crystallization. Solvates may involve nonaqueous solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, DMSO, acetic acid, ethanolamine, and EtOAc, or they may involve water as the solvent that is incorporated into the crystalline lattice. Solvates wherein water is the solvent that is incorporated into the crystalline lattice are typically referred to as "hydrates". Hydrates include stoichiometric hydrates as well as compositions containing variable amounts of water. The invention includes all such solvates.<br>
The skilled artisan will further appreciate that the compounds of the invention in crystalline form, including the various solvates thereof, may exhibit polymorphism (i.e. the capacity to occur in different crystalline structures). These different crystalline forms are typically known as "polymorphs." The invention includes all such polymorphs. Polymorphs have the same chemical composition but differ in packing, geometrical arrangement, and other descriptive properties of the crystalline solid state. Polymorphs, therefore, may have different physical properties such as shape, density, hardness, deformability, stability, and dissolution properties. Polymorphs typically exhibit different melting points, IR spectra, and X-ray powder diffraction patterns, which may be used for identification. The skilled artisan will appreciate that different polymorphs may be produced, for example, by changing or adjusting the reaction conditions or reagents, used in making the compound. For example, changes in temperature, pressure, or solvent may result in polymorphs. In addition, one polymorph may spontaneously convert to another polymorph under certain conditions.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides N-[(2-trifluoromethyl-1H-indol-5-yl)methyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide in crystalline form.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides crystalline N-[(2-trifluoromethyl-1H-indol-5-yl)methyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide characterised in that it provides an XRPD pattern substantially in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
In a further embodiment, the present invention provides crystalline N-[(2-trifluoromethyl-1H-indol-5-yl)methyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide characterised in that it provides an XRPD pattern comprising peaks substantially as set out in Table 1.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides crystalline N-[(2-trifluoromethyl-1H-indol-5-yl)methyi]-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinecarboxamide characterised in that it provides a Raman spectrum substantially in accordance with Figure 2. Therefore, according to a further aspect, the invention provides a solvate, hydrate, prodrug or polymorph of the compounds of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention may exist in one or more tautomeric forms. All tautomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention may possess one or more chiral centres and so exist in a number of stereoisomeric forms. Compounds having one chiral centre may exist as enantiomers or a racemic mixture containing enantiomers. Compounds having two or more chiral centres may exist as diastereoismomers or enantiomers. All stereoisomers (for example enantiomers and diastereoisomers) and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention. Racemic mixtures may be separated to give their individual enantiomer using preparative HPLC using a column with a chiral stationary phase or resolved to yield individual enantiomers utilising methods known to those skilled in the art. In addition, chiral intermediate compounds may be resolved and used to prepare individual enantiomers.<br>
The invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention. An isotopic variation of the compound of the invention is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 170,180,35S, 18F and 36Cl respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the invention, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures such as by the illustrative<br>
methods or by the preparations described in the Examples and Preparations hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared in a variety of ways. In the following reaction schemes and hereinafter, unless otherwise stated R1 to R3 are as defined in the first aspect. These processes form further aspects of the invention.<br>
Throughout the specification, general formulae are designated by Roman numerals (I), (II), (III), (IV) etc. Subsets of these general formulae are defined as (la), (lb), (Ic), etc.(IVa), (IVb), (IVc) etc.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to scheme 1 by coupling compounds of formula (II) with compounds of formula (III). Typical conditions comprise treatment with a suitable coupling agent, such as HATU, HOBt, DCC in a suitable solvent such as DCM or DMF can be used. Alternative conditions comprise conversion of the carboxylic acid (II) to the corresponding acyl chloride, using oxalyl chloride in a suitable solvent (such as THF or DCM) with a suitable base (such as triethylamine).<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared from other compounds of formula (I).<br>
For example, according to reaction scheme 2, compounds of formula (la) where R2 is cyano, may be prepared from compounds of formula (lb), where R2 is bromo, by reaction with zinc cyanide with a suitable catalyst in a suitable solvent.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Compounds of formula (IIIa), i.e. compounds of formula (III) where R1 is hydrogen, may be prepared according to scheme 3. Treatment of compounds of formula (IV) with trifluoroacetic anhydride in the presence of a base (such as triethylamine) in a suitable solvent (such as DCM) gives compounds of formula (V). Halogenation of compounds of formula (V) with a suitable radical halogen source such as sulfuryl chloride or N-bromosuccinimide in a suitable solvent (such as carbon tetrachloride) gives compounds of formula (VI). Treating compounds of formula (VI) with a phosphine derivative (such as triphenylphosphine) gives compounds of formula (VII), which may be cyclised to give compounds of formula (VIII). Typical cyclisation conditions comprise heating in a suitable solvent (such as DMF) to a temperature in excess of 100°C. Compounds of formula (III) are obtained by reduction of compounds of formula (VIII) with borane or nickel borohydride.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br><br>
Compounds of formula (1Mb), i.e. compounds of formula (III) where R1 is C1-3 alkyl, may be prepared according to reaction scheme 4 by reacting compounds of formula (VIII) with a suitable alkyl halide (such as methyl iodide) in the presence of a base (such as sodium<br>
hydride) in a suitable solvent (such as DMF) followed by reduction using borane or nickel borohydride.<br>

For use in medicine, the compounds of the present invention are usually administered as a standard pharmaceutical composition. The present invention therefore provides in a further aspect a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) as hereinbefore described or a salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The pharmaceutical composition can be for use in the treatment of any of the conditions described herein.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient method, for example by oral, parenteral (e.g. intravenous), buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal or transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions adapted accordingly.<br>
The compounds of the invention which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids or solids, for example syrups, suspensions or emulsions, tablets, capsules and lozenges.<br>
A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or salt in a suitable liquid carrier(s) for example an aqueous solvent such as water, ethanol or glycerine, or a non-aqueous solvent, such as polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation may also contain a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring or colouring agent.<br>
A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid formulations.   Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose.<br>
A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures. For example, pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using standard carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule; alternatively, a dispersion or suspension can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s), for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled into a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil. Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration.<br>
Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols, drops, gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension of the active substance in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomising device.<br>
Alternatively the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve which is intended for disposal once the contents of the container have been exhausted. Where the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a compressed gas such as compressed air or an organic propellant such as a fluorochlorohydrocarbon. The aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of a pump-atomiser.<br>
Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges and pastilles, wherein the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar and acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerin.<br>
Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of suppositories containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter.<br>
Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and patches.<br>
The composition may be in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or ampoule. Each dosage unit for oral administration may contain, for example, from 1 to 500 mg (and for parenteral administration contains, for example, from 0.1 to 50 mg) of a compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof calculated as the free base. In an embodiment the unit dose for oral administration contains from 50 to 450 mg. In a further embodiment the unit dose contains from 100 to 400 mg.<br>
In order to obtain consistency of adjunctive administration, the compositions of each of the components, or of the combination of the components is, for example, in the form of a unit dose.<br>
