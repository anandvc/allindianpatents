				<td>OFDM RECEIVER AND ITS AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL CIRCUIT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) receiver for receiving and demodulating an OFDM signal and its automatic<br>
gain controller circuit.<br>
2. Description of Related Art<br>
In recent years, a modulation method called an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing method (hereinafter referred to as an OFDM method) is known as a<br>
method of modulating digital data. With this OFDM modulation method, a number of<br>
orthogonal subcarriers is provided in a transmission band, and digital data is assigned to<br>
the amplitude and phase of each subcarrier by phase shift keying (PSK) or quadrature<br>
amplitude modulation (QAM) to modulate the digital data.<br>
Since the OFDM method divides the transmission band by a number of<br>
subcarriers, the band per one subcarrier becomes narrower and a modulation speed<br>
lowers. However, it has a feature such that a total transmission speed is not different<br>
from that of a modulation method of current related art. Since the OFDM method<br>
transmits a number of subcarriers in parallel, a symbol speed becomes lowers, thereby<br>
enabling to shorten a relative time length of a multipath with respect to a time length of<br>
a symbol. It has therefore another feature of less susceptibility to multipath<br>
interference. Still another feature is such that since the OFDM method assigns data to<br>
a plurality of subcarriers, a transmission/reception circuit can be realized by using an<br>
Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) calculation circuit for inverse Fourier transform<br>
during modulation and a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculation circuit for Fourier<br>
transform during demodulation.<br>
The OFDM method having these features are often applied to terrestrial digital<br>
broadcasting which is strongly influenced by multipath interference. For terrestrial<br>
digital broadcasting adopting the OFDM method, there are standards such as Digital<br>
Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) and Integrated Services Digital<br>
Broadcasting-Terrestrial Sound Broadcasting (ISDB-TSB) (e.g., refer to "Terrestrial<br>
Digital Sound Broadcasting Receiver Standards (Desired Specification) ARIB STD-B30,<br>
ver. 1.1", Association of Radio Industries and Businesses, executed on May 31, 2001<br>
and revised to 1.1 on March 28, 2001, and "Transmission Method for Terrestrial Digital<br>
Sound Broadcasting ARIB STD-B29, ver. 1.1", Association of Radio Industries and<br>
Businesses, executed on May 31, 2001 and revised to 1.1 on March 28, 2001.<br>
In an OFDM receiver of related art, a tuner unit connected to an antenna<br>
converts an OFDM signal of a desired reception channel into an intermediate frequency<br>
(IF) signal which is then supplied to an intermediate frequency amplifier unit. The IF<br>
signal amplified by the intermediate frequency amplifier unit is converted into a digital<br>
signal by an A/D converter circuit, and the digital signal is supplied to a baseband<br>
processing unit. By using a carrier signal having a predetermined frequency (carrier<br>
frequency), the baseband processing unit orthogonally demodulates the digitized IF<br>
signal to obtain an OFDM time domain signal of the baseband. Only the effective<br>
symbol period of the OFDM time domain signal is subjected to FFT to obtain an OFDM<br>
frequency domain signal. The OFDM frequency domain signal is subjected to<br>
differential demodulation of DQPSK or synchronous demodulation of QPSK, 16QAM<br>
or 64QAM to obtain a demodulated output of the OFDM signal of the reception<br>
channel.<br>
The baseband processing unit has therein an automatic gain controller (AGC)<br>
circuit which maintains constant the level of the intermediate frequency signal to be<br>
supplied to the A/D converter circuit by controlling the gain of a voltage controlled<br>
variable gain amplifier constituting the intermediate frequency amplifier unit.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 8, an automatic gain controller circuit 510 of an<br>
OFDM receiver 500 of related art includes an absolute value (ABS) circuit 511, a<br>
subtracter circuit 512, a sign judgment (SON) circuit 513, a low-pass filter 514, a<br>
rounding process (RND) circuit 515, an accumulator circuit 516, etc.<br>
In this automatic gain controller circuit 510, the ABS circuit 511 obtains an<br>
absolute value of the signal level value of the intermediate frequency signal by<br>
removing the sign of the intermediate frequency signal digitized by and supplied from<br>
the A/D converter circuit 504. The subtracter circuit 512 subtracts a fixed target value<br>
from the signal level value of the intermediate frequency signal changed into the<br>
absolute signal level by the ABS circuit 511 to detect a signed difference value. The<br>
SON circuit 513 judges the sign of the signed difference value detected by the<br>
subtracter circuit 512, and supplies a 1-bit sign signal corresponding to the sign of the<br>
difference value to the accumulator circuit 516 via the low-pass filter 514 and rounding<br>
process (RND) circuit 515. The accumulator circuit 516 outputs an accumulation<br>
output as an automatic gain controller (AGC) signal.<br>
The AGC signal output from the automatic gain controller circuit 510 is<br>
supplied to a pulse density modulation (PDM) circuit 520 which outputs a PDM signal<br>
of a rectangular wave whose density changes with an amplitude of the AGC signal.<br>
The PDM signal is fed back via a low-pass filter 525 to a control terminal of a voltage<br>
controlled variable gain amplifier 503 A constituting an intermediate frequency amplifier<br>
unit 503.<br>
As described above, in the automatic gain controller circuit 510 of the OFDM<br>
receiver 500, the fixed target value is used as one of input parameters, and subtracted<br>
from the absolute value of the signal after A/D conversion. The sign of the resultant<br>
value is converted into a 1-bit signal. This signal is passed through the low-pass filter<br>
514 and accumulated in the accumulator circuit 516 to obtain and output the AGC<br>
signal.<br>
Input signals to the A/D converter circuit 504 of the OFDM receiver 500 have a<br>
property of a Gaussian distribution in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)<br>
channel, as shown in Figs. 9A and 9B. If a distribution of input signals is estimated<br>
and a fixed target value is used, a clip amount of the input signal can be adjusted.<br>
Adjusting noises by clipping and adjusting noises by quantization are properly balanced<br>
so that a quantity of noises mixed in the A/D converter circuit 504 can be minimized.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
However, in the OFDM receiver 500 equipped with the automatic gain<br>
controller circuit 510 having the above-described structure, the property (distribution) of<br>
input signals in a mobile channel to the A/D converter circuit 504 shifts from a Gaussian<br>
distribution, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. Figs. 10A and 10B show input signals<br>
(without AGC) and their distribution in a flutter channel, and Figs. 11A and 11B show<br>
input signals (without AGC) and their distribution in a one-wave Rayleigh channel.<br>
If a target value optimized in an AWGN channel is set, a large quantity of<br>
clipping occurs in a mobile channel so that the performance of a receiver is degraded.<br>
If a target is set for a mobile channel, quantization noises increases in an AWGN<br>
channel so that the performance of a receiver is degraded.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing (OFDM) receiver for receiving and demodulating an OFDM signal<br>
without clipping an input signal to an A/D converter circuit in a mobile channel (such as<br>
flutter, one-wave Rayleigh) while suppressing degradation. The present invention is<br>
made in view of the above-described circumstance.<br>
Other objects and particular advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more apparent from the following description of embodiments.<br>
In the present invention, an automatic gain controller (AGC) circuit of an<br>
OFDM receiver automatically controls a target value to an optimum value or<br>
substantially optimum value.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
OFDM receiver for receiving and demodulating an orthogonal frequency<br>
division-multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The OFDM receiver includes: variable gain<br>
amplifier means for controlling a signal level of an intermediate frequency signal that is<br>
obtained from a reception signal by frequency-conversion; and an automatic gain<br>
controller circuit for controlling a gain of the variable gain amplifier means. The<br>
automatic gain controller circuit includes: clip detection means for comparing a clip<br>
number threshold value with a detected number of transient clips in which a signal level<br>
of the intermediate frequency signal that is obtained from a reception signal by<br>
frequency-conversion exceeds a parameter clip level, to detect a period where the<br>
detected number exceeds the clip number threshold value; accumulator means for<br>
accumulating a detection output of the clip detection means; and target value decision<br>
means to which an accumulation output of the accumulator means is supplied. The<br>
target value decision means includes: first comparison means for comparing the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator means with a clip threshold value to judge if a<br>
clip occurs; and second comparison means for comparing the accumulation output of<br>
the accumulator means with a non-clip threshold value to judge whether clip does not<br>
occur. A target value for automatic gain control is adaptively determined by<br>
decreasing by a predetermined amount the target value in accordance with a comparison<br>
output of the first comparison means and by increasing by a predetermined amount the<br>
target value in accordance with a comparison output of the second comparison means.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an<br>
automatic gain controller circuit in an OFDM receiver for receiving and demodulating<br>
an orthogonal frequency division-multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The automatic gain<br>
controller circuit includes: clip detection means for comparing a clip number threshold<br>
value with a detected number of transient clips in which a signal level of the<br>
intermediate frequency signal that is obtained from a reception signal by<br>
frequency-conversion exceeds a parameter clip level, to detect a period where the<br>
detected number exceeds the clip number threshold value; accumulator means for<br>
accumulating a detection output of the clip detection means; and target value decision<br>
means to which an accumulation output of the accumulator means is supplied. The<br>
target value decision means includes: first comparison means for comparing the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator means with a clip threshold value to judge if a<br>
clip occurs; and second comparison means for comparing the accumulation output of<br>
the accumulator means with a non-clip threshold value to judge whether clip does not<br>
occur. A target value for automatic gain control is adaptively determined by<br>
decreasing by a predetermined amount the target value in accordance with a comparison<br>
output of the first comparison means and by increasing by a predetermined amount the<br>
target value in accordance with a comparison output of the second comparison means.<br>
According to the embodiments of the present invention, the automatic gain<br>
controller (AGC) circuit of an OFDM receiver automatically controls a target value to<br>
an optimum value or a substantially optimum value. It is therefore possible not to clip<br>
an input signal for an A/D converter circuit in a mobile channel (such as flutter,<br>
one-wave Rayleigh), thereby suppressing degradation.<br>

Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is applied to an automatic gain<br>
controller circuit 110 of an OFDM receiver 100 having a structure such as shown in Fig.<br>
1.<br>
The OFDM receiver 100 includes a tuner unit 102 connected to an antenna 101,<br>
an intermediate frequency amplifier unit 103 to which an intermediate frequency (IF)<br>
signal converted from an OFDM signal of a desired reception channel by the tuner unit<br>
102 is input, a baseband processing unit 105 to which the intermediate frequency signal<br>
amplified by the intermediate frequency amplifier unit 103 and digitized by an A/D<br>
converter circuit 104 is input, etc.<br>
By using a carrier signal having a predetermined frequency (carrier frequency),<br>
the baseband processing unit 105 orthogonally demodulates the digitized IF signal and<br>
obtains an OFDM time domain signal of the baseband. Only the effective symbol<br>
period of the OFDM time domain signal is subjected to FFT to obtain an OFDM<br>
frequency domain signal. The OFDM frequency domain signal is subjected to<br>
differential demodulation of DQPSK or synchronous demodulation of QPSK, 16QAM<br>
or 64QAM to obtain a demodulated output of the OFDM signal of the reception<br>
channel.<br>
The baseband processing unit 105 contains therein an automatic gain controller<br>
(AGC) circuit 110 which maintains constant the level of the intermediate IF signal to be<br>
supplied to the A/D converter circuit 104, by controlling the gain of a voltage controlled<br>
variable gain amplifier constituting the intermediate frequency amplifier unit 103.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 2, the automatic gain controller circuit 10 may<br>
include an absolute value (ABS) circuit 11, a subtracter circuit 12, an automatic target<br>
circuit 13, a sign judgment (SGN) circuit 14, a low-pass filter 15, a rounding process<br>
(RND) circuit 16, an accumulator circuit 17, etc.<br>
In the automatic gain controller circuit 10, the ABS circuit 11 obtains an<br>
absolute value of the signal level value of the intermediate frequency signal by<br>
removing the sign of the intermediate frequency signal digitized by and supplied from<br>
the A/D converter circuit 104. The subtracter circuit 12 subtracts a target value<br>
supplied from the automatic target circuit 13 from the signal level value of the<br>
intermediate frequency signal changed into the absolute value by the ABS circuit 11 to<br>
detect a signed difference value. The SGN circuit 14 judges the sign of the signed<br>
difference value detected by the subtracter circuit 12, and supplies a 1-bit sign signal<br>
corresponding to the sign of the difference value to the accumulator circuit 17 via the<br>
low-pass filter 15 and rounding process (RND) circuit 16. The accumulator circuit 17<br>
accumulates the sign signal supplied via the rounding process (RND) circuit 16 and<br>
outputs an accumulation output as an automatic gain controller (AGC) signal.<br>
The AGC signal output from the automatic gain controller circuit 10 is supplied<br>
to a pulse density modulation (PDM) circuit 120 which outputs a PDM signal of a<br>
rectangular wave whose density changes with an amplitude of the AGC signal. The<br>
PDM signal is fed back via a low-pass filter 125 to a control terminal of a voltage<br>
controlled variable gain amplifier 103 A constituting an intermediate frequency amplifier<br>
unit 103.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 3, the automatic target circuit 13 may include a<br>
clip detection circuit 131 to which the signal level value of the intermediate frequency<br>
signal changed to the absolute value by the ABS circuit 11 is input, an accumulator<br>
circuit 132 for accumulating a detection output from the clip detection circuit 131, and a<br>
target value decision circuit 133 to which an accumulation value from the accumulator<br>
circuit 132 is input.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 4, the clip detection circuit 131 may include a<br>
clip level comparator 311, an adder 312, a register 313 and a clip number comparator<br>
314.<br>
In this clip detection circuit 131, the clip level comparator 311 compares a<br>
parameter clip level with the signal level value of the intermediate frequency signal<br>
changed to the absolute value by and supplied from the ABS circuit 11, and if the signal<br>
level value is larger, detects it as a transient clip. An output of the clip level<br>
comparator 311, i.e., a detection output of the transient clip, is added by the adder 312 to<br>
a detected number of transient clips stored in the register 313. The register 313 is<br>
cleared at a predetermined period to store a cumulative addition value of the detected<br>
number of transient clips. The clip number comparator 314 compares a clip number<br>
threshold value with the detected number of transient clips stored in the register 313.<br>
If the detected number is equal to the clip threshold value or more, it is judged that a<br>
clip occurs during the corresponding period, and "1" is output as a clip detection. If<br>
the detected number is smaller than the threshold value, "0" is output.<br>
The accumulator circuit 132 of the automatic target circuit 13 accumulates the<br>
detection output of the clip detection circuit 131, and inputs the accumulation output to<br>
the target value decision circuit 133.<br>
The detection output of the clip detection circuit 131 may be input directly to<br>
the target value decision circuit 133. However, in order to monitor the signal level<br>
value in a longer period for dealing with slow fading, the detection output of the clip<br>
detection circuit 131 of the automatic target circuit is accumulated during a<br>
predetermined accumulation period by the accumulator circuit 132, and the<br>
accumulation output is input to the target value decision circuit 133.<br>
The target value decision circuit 133 includes first and second comparators 331<br>
and 332, a near-clip state detection circuit 333, a subtracter 334, an adder 335, first and<br>
second data selectors 336 and 337, an AND gate 338, a register 339, etc.<br>
In the target value decision circuit 133, the accumulation output of the<br>
accumulator circuit 13 is input to the first and second comparators 331, 332 and to the<br>
near-clip state detection circuit 333. The first comparator 331 is supplied with a clip<br>
threshold value SHI for determining that the clip occurs, and the second comparator<br>
332 is supplied with a non-clip threshold value SH2 for determining that the clip does<br>
not occur. The near-clip state detection circuit 333 is supplied with a near-clip<br>
threshold value SH3 for determining that the state is a near-clip state. The register 339<br>
is supplied with a target initial value TOO. The target value output from the resister<br>
339 is supplied to the subtractor 334 and first and second data selectors 336 and 337.<br>
Further, the subtractor 334 is supplied with subtraction data DD indicating an<br>
amount for decreasing the target value, and the adder 335 is supplied with addition data<br>
DI indicating an amount for increasing the target value. The subtractor 334 subtracts<br>
the amount for decreasing the target value represented by the subtraction data DD from<br>
the target value TG output from the register 339, and inputs a substraction output to the<br>
first data selector 336. The adder 335 adds the amount for increasing the target value<br>
represented by the addition data DI to the selection output by the first data selector 336,<br>
and inputs an addition output to the second data selector 337.<br>
The first comparator 331 compares the accumulation output of the accumulator<br>
circuit 13 with the clip threshold value SHI, which is the value for determining that the<br>
clip occurs, and controls the first data selector 336 by the comparison output.<br>
Under control of the comparison output of the first comparator 331, the first<br>
data selector 336 selects the substraction output from the register 339 if the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator circuit 13 exceeds the clip threshold value SHI.<br>
The subtraction output is obtained by subtracting the amount for decreasing the target<br>
value, which is obtained by the subtracter 334, from the target value TG. If the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator circuit 13 does not exceed the clip threshold<br>
value SH2, which is the value for determining that the clip does not occur, the first<br>
selector 336 selects the target value TG output from the resister 339. In this way, if the<br>
clip occurs, the target value TG is lowered. A selection output by the first data selector<br>
336 is input to the adder 335 and the second data selector 337.<br>
The second comparator 332 compares the accumulation output of the<br>
accumulator circuit 13 with the non-clip threshold value SH2, which is the value for<br>
determining that the clip does not occur, and controls the second data selector 337 by<br>
the comparison output via the AND gate 338.<br>
The near-clip state detection circuit 333 detects the near-clip state, which is<br>
close but not equal to the clip-state, based on an accumulation output of the accumulator<br>
circuit 13 and the near-clip threshold value SH3, which is the value for determining the<br>
near-clip state.<br>
Under control of the comparison output of the second comparator 332 via the<br>
AND gate 338, the second data selector 337 selects the addition output if the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator circuit 13 does not exceed the clip threshold<br>
value SH2, which is the value for determining that the clip does not occur. The<br>
addition output is obtained by adding the amount for increasing the target value output<br>
from the adder 335 to the selection output of the first data selector 336. If the<br>
accumulation output of the accumulator circuit 13 exceeds the clip threshold value SH2,<br>
the second selector 337 selects the selection output of the first data selector 336. In<br>
this way, if the clip does not occur, the target value TG is increased. A selection output<br>
by the second data selector 337 is input to the register 339.<br>
The amount for increasing or decreasing the target value may be an external<br>
parameter (amount for increasing or decreasing the target value) or a fixed value.<br>
However, if the selection operation of the second data selector 337 is controlled<br>
only by the comparison output of the second comparator 332, the clip state and non-clip<br>
state are repeated. In order to avoid this, the near-clip state detection circuit 333<br>
detects the near-clip state that is close but not equal to the clip state, and upon the<br>
near-clip state detection, the target value will not be increased. The near-clip state<br>
detection circuit 333 may be a circuit which, for example, subtracts "1" from an output<br>
of the accumulator circuit 132 and compares the subtraction result with the near-clip<br>
threshold value. The near-clip state detection circuit 132 further outputs "1" if the<br>
subtraction result is larger.<br>
The automatic gain controller circuit 10 having the structure described above<br>
may deal with the clip which occurs over a longer span of time, by having the automatic<br>
target circuit 13.<br>
In a reception environment of an OFDM signal at the OFDM receiver 100, the<br>
clip may occur with a shorter time period. Particularly at a flutter channel of 0 dB, a<br>
signal may disappear repetitively. In this case, a typical automatic gain control<br>
increases the gain greatly, and the clip occurs as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The OFDM receiver 100 used in the reception environment of this kind may<br>
use an automatic gain control circuit 20 having the structure such as shown in Fig. 6, in<br>
place of the above-described automatic gain controller circuit 10.<br>
The automatic gain controller circuit 20 shown in Fig. 6 is an improved version<br>
of the automatic gain control circuit 10 to prevent the clip from occurring within a<br>
12<br>
shorter time period. The automatic gain controller circuit 20 includes an absolute<br>
value (ABS) circuit 21, a subtracter circuit 22, an automatic target circuit 23, a sign<br>
(SON) judgment circuit 24, a low-pass filter 25, a rounding process (RND) circuit 26,<br>
an accumulator circuit 27, a signal-off detection circuit 28, a clip detection circuit 29,<br>
etc.<br>
The absolute value (ABS) circuit 21, the subtracter circuit 22, the automatic<br>
target circuit 23, the sign (SON) judgment circuit 24, the low-pass filter 25, the<br>
rounding process (RND) circuit 26, and the accumulator circuit 27 respectively of the<br>
automatic gain controller circuit 20 correspond to the absolute value (ABS) circuit 11,<br>
the subtracter circuit 12, the automatic target circuit 13, the sign (SON) judgment circuit<br>
14, the low-pass filter 15, the rounding process (RND) circuit 16, and the accumulator<br>
circuit 17 respectively of the automatic gain controller circuit 10, and the description of<br>
the constituent elements other than the low-pass filter 25 is omitted.<br>
The low-pass filter 25 has an adder circuit 251 to which a 1-bit sign signal is<br>
supplied from the SON circuit 24, a register 252 for storing an addition output value of<br>
the adder circuit 251, a weighting circuit 253 for weighting an addition output value of<br>
the adder circuit 251 by (1-cc), and a bit shift circuit 254 to which supplied is the<br>
addition output value of the adder circuit 251 stored in the register 252. The addition<br>
output value of the adder circuit 251 stored in the register 252 is supplied back to the<br>
adder circuit 251 via the weighting circuit 253.<br>
The low-pass filter 25 functions as a low-pass filter such that the adder circuit<br>
251 conducts cumulative addition of the sign signal supplied from the SON circuit 14<br>
and weighted by (1-ct) by the weighting circuit 253. The low-pass filter can change its<br>
pass-band width by controlling the bit shift circuit 254 which generates and outputs an<br>
AGC control signal. The AGC control signal is the addition output value of the adder<br>
circuit 251 stored in the register 252 and attenuated by 1/2" through n-bit shift.<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 7, the signal-off detection circuit 28 includes a<br>
signal-off level comparator 281, an adder 282, a resister 283 and a signal-off number<br>
comparator 284.<br>
In the signal-off detection circuit 28, the signal-off level comparator 281<br>
compares a signal-off level with the signal level value of the intermediate frequency<br>
signal that is changed to the absolute value by and supplied from the ABS circuit 21,<br>
and detects a state of a signal-off if the signal level value is smaller. An output of the<br>
signal-off level comparator, i.e., a detection output of signal-off, is added to the detected<br>
number of signal-off stored in the register 283 by the adder 282. The register 283 is<br>
cleared at a predetermined period and stores a cumulative addition value of the detected<br>
number of signal-off. The signal-off comparator 284 compares a signal-off number<br>
threshold value with the detected number of signal-off stored in the register 283. If the<br>
number exceeds the signal-off number threshold value, it is judged the signal-off<br>
occurred in the subject period, and "1" is output as a signal-off detection signal. If the<br>
signal-off number is smaller than the threshold value, "0" is output. Namely, the<br>
signal-off detection circuit 28 outputs a signal-off detection signal which represents by<br>
" 1" the period where the signal-off detected number exceeds the signal-off threshold<br>
value and by "0" the period where the signal-off detected number is smaller than the<br>
threshold value.<br>
The clip detection circuit 29 is structured similar to the clip detection circuit<br>
131 shown in Fig. 4. The clip detection circuit outputs the clip detection signal which<br>
represents by " 1" the period where a detected number of transient clips in which the<br>
signal level value of the intermediate frequency signal, which is changed to the absolute<br>
value by and supplied from the ABS circuit 21, exceeds the clip number threshold value,<br>
and represents by "0" the period in which the detected number is smaller than the<br>
threshold value.<br>
In the automatic gain controller circuit 20, the operation of the bit shift circuit<br>
254 is controlled by each detection output of the signal-off detection circuit 28 and the<br>
clip detection circuit 29.<br>
In other words, if the signal-off detection circuit 28 detects the signal-off state<br>
(no signal), a bit shift amount n of the bit shift circuit 254 is increased. In this way, in<br>
the signal-off state, a change amount of the AGC control signal is reduced so as to<br>
narrow the pass-band width, and to increase the gain of an output of the automatic gain<br>
controller circuit 20 by a small amount.<br>
When the clip detection circuit 29 detects the clip, the bit shift amount n of the<br>
bit shift circuit 254 is reduced. In this way, when the clip occurs, the change amount<br>
of the AGC control signal is increased immediately so as to broaden the pass-band<br>
width, and to lower the output gain quickly.<br>
In the OFDM receiver 100 equipped with the automatic gain controller circuit<br>
20, the target level of AGC is changed at the mobile channel (particularly flutter<br>
channel) so as to reduce the clip of an AGC input signal, thereby enabling improvement<br>
of characteristics of a receiver at a succeeding stage. Furthermore, in an impulse noise<br>
channel, the clip state can be reduced, thereby enabling improvement of characteristics<br>
of a receiver at a succeeding stage. Furthermore, the clip caused by having ACI, CCI<br>
and other noised mixed in an OFDM signal can be reduced, thereby enabling<br>
improvement of characteristics of a receiver at a succeeding stage.<br>
