PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR DAMPING POWER OSCILLATIONS IN TRANSMISSION LINES"<br>
ABB AB, S-721 83, Vasteras, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for damping power oscillations in transmission lines.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for damping power oscillations in transmission lines , and to a device for carrying out the method.<br>
The device comprises means for forming a damping signal in dependence on the amplitude of an estimated power quantity and with an eligible phase sift in relation to the phase position thereof, and an actuator to be influenced in dependence of the damping signal and hence to influence the power transmitted in the transmission line.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In transmission lines, which connect two separate power networks or which connect two parts in one and the same power network, a constant phase-angle difference is maintained, during steady state as a certain transmitted power, between the voltages at the end points of the transmission line. Each change of the transmitted power entails a change of this angular difference. Because of the moments of inertia of the generators in the power network (s), each such change of the angular difference occurs in an oscillating manner with natural frequencies typically in the interval of 0.1 to 2 Hz. The internal damping of these power oscillations is often very small, and, in addition, decreases with increasing amplitude of the oscillation. If the amplitude of the oscillation is sufficiently great, the internal damping may even become negative, in which case the oscillation amplitude grows in an uncontrolled manner such that the transmission of power via the transmission line has to be interrupted._<br>
-2-<br><br>
Especially great power oscillations may occur upon a rapid disconnection of generators or in connection with lines in the power system being disconnected, for example in connection with short circuits on the transmission line or in some of the connected power systems.<br>
Figure 1 shows a typical appearance of a disturbance in the active power in a transmission line included in a power system, for example in case of a loss of a generator which is connected to and feeds power into the power system. The time t is plotted on the horizontal axis and the instantaneous active power p(t) is plotted on the vertical axis. In a given time interval, the disturbance may be characterized by a mean power Pav and an oscillating component Δp(t), the latter having an angular frequency Ω = 27πf. As mentioned above, the frequency f usually lies within the interval 0.1 to 2 Hz.<br>
The damping of the power oscillations may be improved by influencing the power transmitted by the transmission line. In a known way, this influence may, for example, be achieved:<br>
-	by influencing the terminal voltage of a generator connected to the power network(s) by means of a so-called Power System Stabilizer (PSS), which influences the magnetization equipment for the generator and hence the terminal voltage thereof,<br>
-	by influencing the total reactance of the transmission line by means of a controllable series capacitor connected into the line, a so-called Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), in which case thus the total reactance of the transmission line consists of the line reactance plus the reactance of the series capacitor, or<br>
-	by supplying/consuming reactive power at some point on the transmission line by means of a so-called reactive-power compensator (Static Var Compensator, SVC), which<br><br><br>
influences the voltage at that point on the line where the compensator is connected and hence also the power flow in the transmission line.<br>
The generator, the controllable series capacitor, and the reactive-power compensator, respectively, constitute actuators which modulate each of the above-mentioned quantities, the terminal voltage of the generator, the total reactance of the transmission line, the voltage at a certain point along the line, such that, in addition to the original power oscillation, an additional controlled power variation is achieved. If this controlled power variation is carried out with the same frequency as the original oscillation and with a phase position which deviates 90° from the phase position thereof, a damping of the original oscillation is obtained.<br>
In order not to burden the representation with distinc¬tions which are self-explanatory to the person skilled in the art, in the following description the same designa¬tions are generally used for quantities which occur in the installation as for the measured values and signals/calcu¬lating values, corresponding to these quantities, which are supplied to and processed in the control equipment which will be described in the following.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a known embodiment of damping equipment by means of a Power System Stabilizer (PSS). A generator 1 is connected, via a power transformer T1, to a transmission line 2, which in turn is connected to a power network N2 with an additional line 3 (only roughly indica¬ted) . The generator has magnetization equipment la. The voltage V and the current I through the transmission line are sensed by means of a voltage transformer T2 and a current-measuring device IM, respectively. A voltage con¬troller 4, only symbolically shown, is supplied with a<br><br><br>
4<br>
voltage-reference signal and a measured value V of the actual value of the voltage V, which measured value is obtained via the voltage transformer T2 . The output signal from the voltage controller is supplied to the magnetiza-tion equipment of the generator and influences its excita-tion current in such a way that the measured value  approaches the voltage-reference signal  to correspond thereto at least under steady-state conditions.<br>
A power-calculating member 5 is supplied with the measured value VSVAR and with a measured value i(t) of the actual value of the current I and calculates therefrom a calcula-ting value p(t) of the active power delivered to the power network N2 by the generator. This calculating value is supplied to an identification member 6 for identification of the amplitude and the phase position of a power oscillation, if any. The identification member forms from the calculating value p(t) a control signal  which is supplied to the voltage controller of the generator as an addition in addition to the normal voltage reference VREF. Since the power oscillation in the transmission line also occurs in the power delivered by the generator, in this way also a damping of the power oscillation in the trans¬mission line may be achieved.<br>
A known embodiment of the identification member 6 is illustrated in Figure 4. The calculating value p(t) is supplied to a so-called washout filter 61 with a transfer<br>
function   , where s is the Laplace operator. The<br>
filter separates the constant or slowly varying component Pav of the calculating value p(t) but forwards the oscillating part thereof. The filter has a cutoff<br>
frequency   chosen with a sufficient distance from the frequency of the oscillation which is to be damped.<br><br>
5<br>
The above-mentioned desired phase shift of 90° of the oscillating part of the calculating value p(t) is achieved with the aid of one or more lead-lag filters, in this embodiment by means of two cascade-connected filters 62<br>
and 63 with the transfer functions  respectively.<br>
The output signal D(t) from the lead-lag filter 63 con¬stitutes a damping signal which, after a necessary adapta¬tion (not shown in the figure) of the signal level to constitute the control signal   is utilized for modula¬ting the terminal voltage of the generator, thus achieving the desired controlled power variation.<br>
Because of limitations of the available control range of the actuators (limited by the maximum stresses which the apparatus may endure), limitations (only roughly indicated in the figure) of the output signals from the lead-lag filters are introduced.<br>
These limitations have an adverse effect on the efficiency of the damping equipment in that the effective amplifica¬tion at large signals is reduced below the nominal ampli¬fication at small oscillating amplitudes when the limita¬tions are not active.<br>
Experience shows that, in case of disturbances of the power systems, a change of the mean power on the trans¬mission line is obtained, almost without exception, at the same time as the oscillation is initiated. This is illu¬strated in Figure 1 which also shows how the original power is slowly stabilized at a new level. This return is controlled by overriding control systems in the power system and has a negligible effect on the power oscilla¬tion. However, a further problem is that the fast change<br><br>
of the mean power which occurs when a power oscillation starts (see Figure 1) causes an undesired transient con¬tribution to the output signal from the washout filter. This contribution tends to make the total output signal from the filter so large as to exceed the available con¬trol range of the actuators. To counteract this, limita¬tions in the lead-lag filters, according to some so-called non-integral windup strategy, are introduced. A negative consequence of this process, however, is that the main¬tenance of the desired phase shift in the lead-lag filters is rendered difficult.<br>
In a power system with more than two generators, several oscillation modes with different frequencies occur, in which different groups of generators oscillate between themselves. This causes damping equipment, the control equipment of which is based on the prior art according to Figure 4, to react on the different oscillation modes, a consequence of which may be that oscillation modes, which per se have an acceptable internal damping, may be dis¬turbed by action from the damping equipment.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a known embodiment of damping equipment in which the actuator is in the form of a con¬trollable series capacitor (TCSC). A generator Gl is connected, via a power transformer Tl, to a power network Nl, and a generator G2 is connected, via a power trans¬former T3, to a power network N2. The power networks are interconnected by means of at least one transmission line 2, into which a controllable series capacitor 7 is connected. It is assumed in the following that the controllable series capacitor, in a manner known per se, is controlled by a reactance regulator 8 via a reference value for its reactance.<br><br><br>
A power-calculating member 5 calculates, in a manner similar to that described with reference to Figure 2, a calculating value p(t) of the active power transmitted by the transmission line. The calculating value is supplied to a reactance calculating member 9 which comprises wash-out and lead-lag filters, as described with reference to Figure 4, as well as an adaptation (not shown in the figure) of the damping signal D(t) to constitute a correc¬tion value ΔXP0D. This correction value is supplied, together with the reference value XREF for the reactance of the series capacitor, to a summing member 10, the output signal of which is supplied to the reactance regulator 8 to achieve the desired controlled power variation.<br>
Figure 9A schematically shows a known embodiment of damp¬ing equipment in which the actuator is in the form of a reactive-power compensator (SVC), and in which corre¬sponding parts of the figure, and, where applicable, corresponding quantities, have been given the same reference numerals as in Figure 3. A reactive-power compensator 7' is connected in shunt connection to the transmission line 2 at a connection point Jl. The impe¬dance of the transmission line between the connection point and the power networks Nl and N2 are marked in the figure as line reactances LR1 and LR2, respectively. The compensator is adapted, in a manner known per se, to in¬fluence the voltage V at the connection point Jl via a voltage regulator 8' which, as output signal, forms and supplies to the compensator a reference value B(t) for its susceptance.<br>
A difference-forming member 4' is supplied and forms as output signal the difference of a voltage-reference value<br>
  and a measured value   obtained via the voltage transformer T2, of the actual value of the voltage V, which output signal is supplied to the voltage controller.<br><br><br>
The calculating value p(t) is supplied to a calculating member 9' which comprises washout and lead-lag filters as described with reference to Figure 4, and an adaptation (not shown in the figure) of the damping signal D(t) to constitute a correction value AU(t). This correction value is supplied to the difference-forming member 4' as an addition to the voltage-reference value  The reference value B(t) for the susceptance of the compensator is thus formed in dependence on the correction value AU(t).<br>
When the voltage at the connection point Jl varies (in dependence on the correction value AB(t)), also the active power flow in the transmission line will be influenced. It is to be noted that the relation between the voltage variation and the power variation depends on the location of the compensator along the transmission line as well as on the voltage characteristic for the load placed at the receiving end of the line, in the figure marked as a load L connected to the power network N2. An increase of the voltage at the connection point Jl usually leads to an increase of the transmitted active power, which relieves the generator G2 . In the event that the compensator (in this example) is connected near the power network N2 and, in addition, the load L is of a certain magnitude and/or is greatly dependent on the voltage, it may, however, happen that a voltage increase at the connection point Jl leads to such a large power increase in the load L that the load on the generator G2 instead increases. Under these circumstances, a reversal of the signs of correction values AU(t) to the reference value of the voltage con¬troller must thus take place in order for a correct damp¬ing of the power oscillations to be obtained.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to achieve a method of the kind described in the introduction, which permits a fast and robust identification of a component of the power oscillation, oscillating with a given angular frequency, without the identification being disturbed by the simul¬taneously occurring change of the mean power and of oscillations with deviating angular frequencies, and to a device for carrying out the method.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved by generating at least one first angular-frequency signal, representing a first angular frequency which is given  a priori knowledge of oscillation frequencies expected in the power system forming a first phase-reference signal as the time integral of the first angular-frequency signal, sensing a power quantity characterizing for the power transmitted by the transmission line, forming a first estimated power quantity in dependence on the characterizing power quantity, representing for an oscillation of the first angular frequency its amplitude and phase position relative to the first phase-reference signal, forming a first damping signal with an amplitude in dependence on the amplitude of the first estimated power quantity and with an eligible first phase shift in relation to the phase position thereof and by influencing an actuator in dependence on the first damping signal to thereby influence the power transmitted in the transmission line.<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, whereby the power system exhibits at least two oscillation modes, at least one second angular-frequency signal is generated in addition thereto, representing a second angular fre¬quency which is given by a priori knowledge of oscillation frequencies expected in the power system, a second phase-<br><br><br><br>
reference signal is formed as the time integral of the second angular-frequency signal, a second estimated power quantity is formed in dependence on the characterizing power quantity, representing for an oscillation of the second angular frequency its amplitude and phase position relative to the second phase-reference signal, a second damping signal is formed with an amplitude in dependence on the amplitude of the second estimated power quantity and with an eligible second phase shift in relation to the   phase position thereof, and the actuator is influenced also in dependence on the second damping signal.<br>
In another advantageous development of the invention, a correction frequency to the angular-frequency signal(s) is formed in dependence on the actual frequency of the power oscillations when the amplitude of the oscillating compo¬nent in the estimated power quantity/quantities exceeds an eligible level.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, the damping signal(s) is/are deactivated if the correction frequency exceeds or falls below the respective given levels.<br>
In still another advantageous development of the inven¬tion, the amplitude of the damping signal(s) is formed in dependence on an amplification factor which increases with increasing amplitude of the respective estimated power quantity/quantities mentioned.<br>
In yet another advantageous development of the invention, the eligible phase shift(s) mentioned is/are formed in dependence on the amplitude of an estimated value of the mean power in the transmission line.<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following description relates to the method as well as to the device.<br>
It is to be understood that, although the blocks shown in the figures are described as units, members, filters, etc., these are to be understood as means for achieving the desired function, particularly in the case where their functions are implemented as software in, for example, microprocessors.<br>
Especially the blocks and members described in Figures 5-9A, 9B may be carried out in some way known to the person skilled in the art, and therefore only their function will be described in the following.<br>
According to the invention, a priori knowledge of the expected frequency of the power oscillation is utilized for estimating the oscillating component of the oscilla¬tion without any annoying influence of the simultaneous mean-power change and oscillations with deviating fre¬quency. This is done by carrying out the estimation on the basis of an angular frequency given through knowledge of the expected behaviour - from the point of view of oscillation - of the power system in which the trans¬mission line is included. Such knowledge is obtained in ways known per se to the person skilled in the art by system studies in the form of calculations or simulations, or, alternatively, by observations of the power system, for example in connection with disturbances.<br>
From the identified oscillating component, a damping signal with the desired properties, for example with an amplitude proportional to the amplitude of the oscillation<br><br>
and with the desired relative phase in relation to the oscillation, may then be derived.<br>
Depending on which actuator is utilized for the damping, an additional adaptation of the damping signal may be carried out. This applies, for example, when the actuator is in the form of a controllable series capacitor which is controlled with a reference value for its reactance, or in the form of a static reactive-power compensator which is controlled with a reference value for its susceptance.<br>
By p(t) is meant in the following a quantity characte¬rizing for the active power in a transmission line, for example the above-described calculating value of the power transmitted by the transmission line, and the power deli¬vered by a generator to a power network via a transmission line, respectively. Let it further be assumed that the expected oscillation frequency is known and that its an¬gular frequency is Ω.<br>
A first embodiment of the invention.<br>
In a certain time interval, the active power may be ex¬pressed in terms of a mean power Pav and a superimposed oscillating component Ap(t) according to<br>
(1) <br>
where 9{t) is a phase-reference signal formed as the time integral of the given angular frequency Ω, Pav   is a scalar<br>
constant or a slowly varying function of the time, and<br>
  is a complex constant or a slowly varying function of the time. The task is thus to identify these constants in an efficient way. The phase-reference signal is thus used<br><br><br>
as a reference for phase position for the oscillating com¬ponent <br>
The expression (1) is re-written in the following way, where an asterisk as upper index denotes a complex conjugation of the corresponding quantity,<br>
(2) <br>
whereupon the expressions (1) and (2) are transformed into (3) <br>
The righthand terms in expression (3) become constants (complex and scalar, respectively) if the power signal p(t)<br>
may be produced as in expression (1). Let it now be<br>
assumed that estimated values of the constants <br>
are available, such that these estimated values in ex¬pression (3) may replace the constants <br>
pectively. This gives<br><br><br><br>
To the extent that the estimated values are correct and on condition that the expression (1) approximates the actual quantity p(t)   characterizing for the active power, the<br>
righthand terms in the expression (4) will be constant. After a signal processing comprising low-pass filtering on the righthand term in expression (4), estimated values of the desired constants   are therefore obtained.<br>
This gives the following algorithm:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where   are operators representing filters<br>
with low-pass characteristic. Low-pass filtering of the complex quantity  is then performed on its real part and its imaginary part, respectively, separately.<br>
Figure 5 shows in the form of block diagrams how the separation of the oscillating component is carried out according to this embodiment of the invention. It can be shown that the estimated values of the desired constants   after a transient dependent on the time con¬stants in the low-pass filters, assume stabilized values describing the oscillating component   according to<br>
expression (1) above.<br>
A difference-forming member 50 is supplied with and forms as output signal the difference of the quantity p(t) ,<br>
characterizing for the active power, and an estimated value  of the mean power   formed in a way which will<br>
become clear from the following description. The output signal from the member 50 is supplied to a multiplying member 51, where it is multiplied by a factor 2. A difference-forming member 52 is supplied with and forms as output signal the difference of the result of the multi¬plication and the calculating value   formed in a way which will become clear from the following descript¬ion. The output signal from the member 52 is supplied to a multiplying member 53 for multiplication by a factor  and the result of the multiplication is supplied to a low-pass filtering member 54 characterized by a transfer function   A comparison with the expression (5) above<br><br><br><br>
now shows that the output signal from the member 54 con¬stitutes the desired estimated power quantity  <br>
The output signal from the member 54 is supplied to a calculating member 55 which, as output signal, forms the complex conjugate  to the estimated power quantity  which output signal is supplied to a multiplying member 56 for multiplication by the factor  . The result of this multiplication constitutes the calculating value  which, for one thing, as mentioned above, is supplied to the difference-forming member 52 and, for another, a cal¬culating member 57 which, as output signal, forms the real<br>
part of the supplied calculating value. This output sig¬nal, designated   in the figure, thus constitutes an<br>
estimated value of the oscillating component   of the frequency superimposed on the mean power<br>
A difference-forming member 58 is supplied with and forms as output signal the difference of the quantity p{t) ,<br>
characterizing for the active power, and the output signal<br>
from the calculating member 57. The output signal from the<br>
member 58 is supplied to a low-pass filtering member 59 characterized by a transfer function  A comparison<br>
with the expression (5) above now shows that the output signal from the member 59 constitutes the estimated value   of the mean power  which, as mentioned above, is<br>
supplied to the difference-forming member 50.<br>
The above-mentioned members 51-57 together form a calcula¬ting device ESTl, which together with the difference-forming member 50 constitutes a filter device.<br>
Figure 5 also illustrates how the phase-reference signal   is formed as the time integral of the given angular<br>
frequency   in an integrating member 50a and how the above-mentioned factor  is formed in dependence on the<br><br><br>
phase-reference signal in a calculating member 50b. An angular frequency Ω.   representing the given angular frequency is formed in a manner known per se in a signal-generating member, illustrated in Figure 5 by a block 50d, the output signal of which is integrated in the integra¬ting member 50a.<br>
The filter device shown in Figure 5 thus achieves a signal processing which comprises low-pass filtering of the esti¬mated power quantity  and of the estimated mean power   in the transmission line by means of low-pass filtering<br>
members arranged in a cross-connection in that the esti¬mated power quantity  is formed in dependence on com¬ponents of the estimated value of the mean power,<br>
obtained through low-pass filtering, and the estimated value   of the mean power is formed in dependence on<br>
components of the estimated power quantity   also obtained through low-pass filtering.<br>
The low-pass filtering members 54 and 59 may, for example, be realized as first-order low-pass filters or second-order Bessel- or Butterworth-type filters with a bandwidth at -3 dB of typically (0.2 - 0.5) *Ω .<br>
A second embodiment of the invention<br>
The second embodiment of the invention is based on the use of a recursive regression according to the least-squares method, a so-called RLS algorithm. The mathematical back¬ground of the estimation is described below.<br>
The expression (1) above may also be written as (6) <br><br><br>
where   designate the real component and the<br>
imaginary component, respectively, of the complex quantity   . Here, all the unknown constants  are<br>
real. The first equation in the expression (6) may then be conceived as a regressive equation<br><br>
where  is a so-called regression vector and   is the sought parameter vector with the constants   and<br>
  . The parameter vector may be determined with the aid<br>
of a recursive least-squares estimation, a so-called RLS algorithm in a manner known per se, for example in the manner described in Astrom/Wittenmark: Adaptive Control (ISBN 0-201-55866-1).<br>
where<br><br>
The solution is given by the following expression<br><br><br><br><br>
is the estimated parameter vector, / is a unit matrix, and<br>
  the so-called forgetting factor which controls the memory of the algorithm.<br>
Figure 6 shows in the form of a block diagram the second embodiment of the invention.<br>
A calculating block 60 is supplied with the phase-reference signal, formed in the manner stated above, and forms as output signal the regression vector <br>
The quantity p(t)   characterizing for the active power, the<br>
regression vector and the forgetting factor are supplied to a calculating member 61, which, in dependence on the supplied values and, in the manner mentioned above, as output signal forms the estimated parameter vector accor¬ding to the expression (9).<br>
Generation of a damping signal for influencing the damping equipment according to the invention<br>
Based on the estimated power quantity   preferably obtained through any of the embodiments described above for separation of the oscillating component in the power signal, a damping signal D(t)   can be generated. The ampli¬tude thereof is formed in dependence on the amplitude <br>
of the oscillating component, for example proportional thereto with an amplification factor kD   and with an<br><br>
eligible phase shift 90°+ a   in relation to the phase position for the oscillating component in the power signal.<br><br><br><br>
It can be shown that, if only the moment of inertia of the generators are taken into consideration and if the losses in the transmission system are neglected, the ideal phase shift between power oscillation and damping signal is 90°. The angle a   in the expression (10) above has been added to make possible a correction of the ideal phase shift taking into account the influence of losses and other factors. The angle a   is, in practice, of the order of some ten degrees.<br>
Figure 7 shows the expression (10) in the form of a sche¬matic block diagram.<br>
The phase reference signal   is formed as the time<br>
integral of the given angular frequency Ω.   in the inte¬grated member 50a and a factor  formed in dependence on the phase reference signal in a calculating member 50c. A factor is formed in dependence on the angle a in a cal¬culating member 71.<br>
The estimated power quantity and the factor   are supplied to a multiplying member 72 and the result of the multiplication is supplied together with the factor   to a multiplying member 73. The output signal from the multi¬plying member 73 is supplied to a calculating block 74 which, as output signal, forms the imaginary part of the signal supplied thereto. The output signal from the calculating block 74 is thus equal to  that<br>
is, apart from the factor   equal to the third term in<br>
the expression (10). The output signal from the block 74 and the factor -kD   are supplied to a multiplying member<br>
75, the output signal of which thus constitutes the damping signal D(t).<br>
The damping signal D(t)   thus represents a desired influence on the torque on the oscillating machines.<br><br><br>
In the case where the actuator consists of magnetization equipment for a generator, as described above with reference to Figure 2, the damping signal, after level adaptation and limitation with respect to the operating range of the magnetization equipment, may be used directly as a control signal for the damping equipment. This is illustrated in Figure 7 in the form of an output from the multiplying member 75 designated PSS.<br>
In the case where the actuator consists of a controllable series capacitor, as described above with reference to Figure 3, the total effective reactance for the connection via the transmission line shall be influenced.<br>
The influence on the torque in a generator will thus be dependent on  the instantaneous direction of the power flow. Generally, damping is achieved if the total effec¬tive reactance of the transmission line decreases (i.e. becomes less inductive) when the power deviates from a zero line for the power, and if the total effective reac¬tance increases (i.e. becomes more inductive) when the power approaches this zero line.<br>
It is thus possible to transform the damping signal to a desired reactance signal (a signal corresponding to a reactance value for the controllable series capacitor) according to the following<br>
(11) <br>
where sign[p(t)]  designates the instantaneous power flow direction. As illustrated in Figure 7, the signal , <br>
is formed in some manner known per se in dependence on the quantity p(t) , characterizing for the active power, in a<br>
calculating member 7 6 and is supplied together with the damping signal D(t)   to a multiplying member 77, which as<br><br><br><br>
output signal thus forms a signal according to the ex¬pression (11) above.<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 7 in the form of an output from the multiplying member 77 designated TCSC.<br>
The signal thus obtained is adapted with respect to level and is then limited to those reactance values which the main circuit of TCSC can execute. These reactance values may be continuously or discontinuously variable or a com¬bination of continuously and discontinuously variable values.<br>
In the case where the actuator consists of a reactive-power compensator, as described above with reference to Figure 9A, the damping signal may be directly used, after adaptation with respect to level and limitation with respect to the operating range of the compensator, as a control signal for the voltage controller of the compen¬sator. This is illustrated in Figure 7 in the form of an output from the multiplying member 75 designated SVC. The<br>
necessity, in certain applications, of sign reversal of the damping signal or of the correction value AU(t)   to the<br>
reference value of the voltage controller, depending on the damping signal, as described with reference to Figure 9A, is not shown in Figure 7, but this modification may of course, where necessary, be carried out by a person skilled in the art.<br>
Frequency correction<br>
As mentioned above, the control device according to the invention is intended for power oscillations of a certain given frequency. In a power system, different operating states occur depending on which lines are in operation at a certain time. The frequency of the power oscillation in<br><br><br><br>
a certain mode will thus vary somewhat in dependence on the operating state of the power system. If the frequency of the actual oscillation deviates from the frequency to which the control device is set, the vector   represen¬ting the estimated power quantity, will rotate with the deviation frequency. The phase shift between the damping signal and the actual oscillation thus does not become the intended 90° +a .<br>
According to a development of the invention, a frequency correction to the given angular frequency Ω.   is therefore introduced in order to adapt the frequency of the damping signal to the frequency of the actual oscillation. An embodiment of such a frequency correction is described in the following and illustrated in Figure 8.<br>
The estimated power quantity   is supplied to an absolute-value forming member 81 which, as output signal,<br><br><br><br>
forms the absolute value<br><br>
of the amplitude of the<br><br>
estimated power quantity. The estimated power quantity   is also supplied to a phase-value forming member 82 which, as output signal, forms the argument  representing the phase position of the estimated power quantity.<br>
The output signal from the absolute-value forming member<br><br><br><br>
81, that is, the absolute value<br><br>
is supplied to a<br><br>
comparing member 83 for comparison with a comparison value<br><br><br><br>
AMPR. In the event that the absolute value<br><br>
exceeds the<br><br>
comparison value AMPR, the comparing member 83 forms a logic signal DEV which is supplied to a time-lag element 84 which forwards the signal DEV, delayed by an eligible time tl and now designated DEV, to a so-called sample-and-hold unit 85. The unit 85 is also supplied with the<br><br><br><br>
estimated power quantity   and, when it receives the delayed signal DEV, senses the power quantity and for¬wards the value thereof at this time, here designated to, to a phase-value forming member 86. The phase-value forming member 86 forms as output signal the argument<br><br>
representing the phase position of the estimated power quantity at the time tO.<br>
The output signal  from the phase-value forming member<br>
86 is now allowed to constitute a reference value for the actual phase position of the estimated power quantity,<br>
  which, as described above, is formed as output signal from the phase-value forming member 82.<br>
The signals   and  are supplied to a difference-forming<br>
member 87 and their difference to a frequency controller 88, preferably with proportional-integrating characteris¬tic. The output signal from the frequency controller 88 will thus have the form<br><br>
where  _  constitutes a correction frequency to the given angular frequency Q and kDF   and TDF   are amplification and<br>
time constant, respectively, in the frequency controller.<br>
The correction frequency ΔΩ   and the given angular<br>
frequency Ω.   are supplied to a summing member 89, which as output signal forms a corrected angular frequency <br>
according to the expression<br><br><br>
•xr<br><br>
In this development of the invention, the given angular frequency Ω., in the embodiments of the invention described<br>
with reference to Figures 5, 6 and 7, is replaced by the corrected angular frequency  in the expressions desc¬ribed above, whereas the given angular frequency Ω is only utilized to be supplied to the summing member 89, as desc¬ribed with reference to Figures 8 and 9B. This is illu¬strated in Figures 5, 6 and 7 by an input signal   to<br>
the integrating member 50a, put in parenthesis. The corre¬sponding output signal from the integrating member, that is, the phase-reference signal 6{t) , is also indicated in<br>
parenthesis.<br>
The delay tl in the time-lag element 84 may to advantage be chosen to constitute 1-2 cycles of the given angular frequency Ω .<br>
To prevent the damping from interfering and destabilizing oscillating modes in the power system for which it is not intended, in an additional development of the invention maximum permissible frequency deviations   both upwards and downwards from the given angular frequency for the power oscillation, set in the control system, are defined. The frequency controller 88 is thus modified such that, for all oscillations where the frequency deviation  exceeds the maximum permissible frequency deviation, its output signal remains at this maximum permissible frequency deviations, and, for all oscillations where the frequency deviation falls below the downward maximum permissible frequency deviation, its output signal remains at this downward maximum permissible frequency deviation. When the frequency controller in connection with power oscillations in the transmission line remains in any of<br><br><br><br>
these limitations for a predetermined period of time, the damping signal is deactivated.<br>
This is illustrated schematically in Figure 9B. A selector 91 has two inputs, one being supplied with the damping signal D(t)   formed in the manner described above, and the<br>
other being supplied with a signal with the value ZERO and forwarding on its output a signal designated D\{t) .   The<br>
signal D\(t)   is, in the normal position of the selector,<br>
identical with the damping signal D(t)   but in dependence on<br>
an influencing signal DACT, supplied to the selector, the position of the selector is changed such that it forwards the signal with the value ZERO. The frequency deviation AΩ,   formed as output signal from the frequency controller 88, is supplied to a limiting device 92 with schematically indicated limitations, both upwards and downwards, of the signal supplied thereto. The output signal ΔΩ1 from the limiting device 92 is thus equal to the frequency devia¬tion ΔQ as long as the latter does not exceed the maximum permissible frequency deviations but is otherwise limited to these deviations. The output signal ΔΩ1 from the limi¬ting device 92 is supplied, in this development of the invention, to the summing member 89, in a manner analogous to that described with reference to the expression (14) above.<br>
In some manner known per se, the limiting device forms logic output signals biml and Lim2, respectively, when the frequency deviation ΔΩ reaches an upper and a lower limi¬tation, respectively. The signals Liml and Lim2 are supplied to an OR  circuit 93 which forwards these to a timing circuit 94. In the event that any of the signals Liml and Lim2 remains at least for a predetermined period of time tL, the timing circuit forms, in some manner known per se, the influencing signal DACT.<br><br><br>
Power-dependent amplification and/or phase shift<br>
Oscillations occurring during normal operation normally exhibit a low amplitude and the inherent damping ability of the power system is normally sufficient for damping such oscillations. Under such circumstances, an inter¬vention by the damping device is not necessary, and therefore a low value may advantageously be imparted to the amplification factor kD   in the damping signal at such<br>
oscillation amplitudes, among other things to reduce the thermal stress on the actuators which are to deliver the damping effect.<br>
To ensure that sufficient damping is achieved at increasing oscillation amplitudes, the value of the amplification factor should then also increase, advan¬tageously in dependence on the amplitude of the oscilla¬tion, for example stepwise or according to a chosen continuous characteristic.<br>
Especially in the case where the actuator consists of a static shunt compensator for reactor power connected to the transmission line, the damping ability of which is normally dependent on the magnitude and direction of the power flow in the transmission line, it may be advan¬tageous to form the eligible angle a , described with reference to Figure 7 in the section entitled Generation of damping signal'.<br>
Figure 10A shows an embodiment of a power-dependent adaptation of the amplification factor kD .   The estimated<br>
of which is supplied to a functional-value forming member 102. This member generates a value kD<br><br>
output signal<br>
power quantity  formed, for example, by means of the filter device described with reference to Figure 5, is supplied to an absolute-value forming member 101, the<br><br>
of the amplification factor in dependence on the amplitude of the estimated power quantity and according to a charac¬teristic selected for the functional-value forming member, this characteristic being illustrated in the figure as a step-by-step function. The output signal from the functional-value forming member 102 is supplied, with reversed sign, to the multiplying member 75 described with reference to and shown in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 10B shows an embodiment of a power-dependent adaptation of the eligible angle a .   The estimated mean power  formed, for example, by means of the filter<br>
device described with reference to Figure 5, is supplied to a functional-value forming member 103. This member generates a value a   of  the eligible angle in dependence on the amplitude of estimated mean power and according to a characteristic selected for the functional-value forming member, this characteristic being illustrated in the figure as a continuous non-linear function which may adopt both negative and positive values. The output signal from the functional-value forming member 103 is supplied to the calculating member 71 described with reference to and shown in Figure 7.<br>
Simultaneous damping of oscillations of more than one oscillation frequency<br>
The foregoing description relates to embodiments of the invention where it is assumed that the device is intended for damping of oscillations of one single given frequency.<br>
In a power system with more than two generators, several oscillation modes with different frequencies occur, in which different groups of generators oscillate between themselves.<br><br><br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, the damp¬ing device may be designed for achieving simultaneous damping of several such oscillating modes with different but given frequencies. The following description of this development relates only to two oscillation modes with the angular frequencies Ω1 and Ω2, respectively. However, the<br>
principle described may be extended, in a manner obvious to the person skilled in the art, to apply to three or more oscillation modes.<br>
Let it be assumed that two expected oscillation frequen¬cies are known and that the angular frequencies thereof are Ω1 and Ω2, respectively. The expression (1) above may<br>
then be generalized to read (15) <br>
By a reasoning completely analogous to that which, based on the expression (1), results in the expression (5) for the estimated values of the desired constants  an algorithm is now obtained which expresses the estimated values of the desired constants of the<br>
following form<br><br><br><br>
where   are operators representing<br>
filters with low-pass characteristic. The low-pass fil¬tering of the complex quantities <br>
carried out on the real parts and the imaginary parts thereof, respectively, each separately.<br>
Figure 11 shows in the form of a block diagram how the separation of the oscillating components according to the expression (16) is carried out according to this development of the invention.<br>
A difference-forming member 501 is supplied with and forms<br>
as output signal the difference of, for one thing, the quantity p(t)   characterizing for the active power and, for<br>
another, en estimated value  of the mean power   and an estimated value of the oscillating component   of the frequency Ω2, which oscillating component is superimposed on the mean power, and which estimated values are formed in a manner which will be clear from the following. The output signal from the difference-forming member 501 is supplied to the calculating device EST1 described with reference to Figure 5, which calculating device thus com¬prises members of the same kind as the members 51-53 and 55-57, described with reference to Figure 5, and indicated with the same reference numerals in Figure 11. The low-pass filter 54 shown in Figure 5 has been indicated in Figure 11 with a characteristic   In a manner ana¬logous to that described with reference to Figure 5, the output signal from the low-pass filtering member 54 con¬sists of the desired estimated power quantity  which is also clear on a direct comparison with the expression (16) .<br>
A difference-forming member 502 is supplied with and forms as output signal the difference of, on the one hand, the<br><br><br>
32<br>
quantity p(t)   characterizing for the active power and, on the other hand, an estimated value   of the mean power  and an estimated value of the oscillating component  of the frequency Ω1 , which oscillating component is super¬imposed on the mean power, and which estimated values are formed in a manner which will be clear from the following. The output signal from the difference-forming member 502 is supplied to a calculating device EST2 which comprises members 51-53 and 55-57 of the same kind as the calcula¬ting device ESTl. In order not to make the figure un¬necessarily complicated, however, these members are not shown in the device EST2. A low-pass filtering member,<br>
indicated with reference numeral 542 in Figure 11, charac¬terized by a transfer function   is of the same kind<br>
as and corresponds to the low-pass filtering member 54 described with reference to Figure 5. In a manner ana¬logous to that described with reference to Figure 5, the output signal from the member 542 constitutes the desired estimated power quantity   which is also clear on a direct comparison with the expression (16).<br>
The estimated value  of the oscillating component   of the frequency Ω1, , superimposed on the mean power, and the estimated value  of the oscillating component  of the frequency Ω2, superimposed on the mean power, are formed in a manner analogous to that described with reference to Figure 5 as output signals from the calculating member 57 in the calculating devices ESTl and EST2, respectively (member 57 in device EST2 not shown in the figure).<br>
A  difference-forming member 58 is supplied with and forms as output signal the difference of the quantity p(t)<br>
characterizing for the active power and the output signals   from the calculating member 57 in the device<br>
ESTl and in the device EST2, respectively. The output signal from the member 58 is supplied to a low-pass<br><br><br><br>
filtering member 59 characterized by a transfer function   which member is of the same kind as the low-pass<br>
filtering member, described with reference to Figure 5, with the same reference numeral. A comparison with the expression (16) above now shows that the output signal from the member 59 constitutes the estimated value<br>
  of the mean power  which, as mentioned above, is<br>
supplied to the difference-forming members 501 and 502.<br>
Figure 11 also illustrates how the phase-reference signal   is formed as the time integral of the given angular<br>
frequency Ω1, in an integrating member 50al and how the factor   is formed in dependence on the phase-reference<br>
signal in the calculating member 50bl. An angular-frequency signal Ω1, representing the given angular<br>
frequency is formed in a manner known per se in a signal-generating member, illustrated in Figure 11 by a block 50dl, the output signal of which is integrated in the integrating member 50al.<br>
The phase-reference signal   the factor  and an angular-frequency signal Ω2 are formed in an analogous manner in an integrating member 50a2, in a calculating member 50b2, and in a signal-generating member 50d2.<br>
The expression (10) for the damping signal will in this case have the form<br>
(17) <br>
which, after expansion in a way similar to that in expression (10), will have the form as illustrated in Figure 12, which is to compare with Figure 7.<br>
The members 50al, 50cl and 711-751 shown in Figure 12 are of the same kind and correspond to the members 50a, 50c<br><br><br>
34-<br>
and 71-75 described with reference to Figure 7 and are<br>
supplied with quantities corresponding to those which have<br>
been described with reference to Figure 7 and which are to<br>
refer to the oscillation mode with an angular frequency Ω1 .<br>
The members 50a2, 50c2 and 712-752 shown in Figure 12 are<br>
also of the same kind and correspond to the members 50a,<br>
50c and 71-75 described with reference to Figure 7 and are<br>
supplied with the corresponding quantities as described<br>
with reference to Figure 7 and which are to refer to the oscillation mode with an angular frequency Ω2.<br>
The output signal from the multiplying member 7 51 consti¬tutes a damping signal D1(t) for damping the oscillation mode with an angular frequency Ω1 and the output signal<br>
from the multiplying member 752 constitutes a damping signal D2(t)   for damping the oscillation mode with an angular frequency Ω2    the two damping signals D1(t)   and D2{t)   are supplied to a summing member 78, the output signal of which forms a resultant damping signal D{t) .   The<br>
resultant damping signal may be processed and utilized as described above with reference to Figure 7.<br>
Also the frequency correction, described above, for adap¬tation of the frequency of the damping signal to the actual frequency of the real oscillation may be applied to this embodiment of the invention, in this case by an individual frequency correction for each one of the given expected frequencies. This extension of the frequency correction to comprise more than one frequency may, on the basis of the above description, be performed in a manner obvious to the person skilled in the art and will not therefore be described in greater detail in this context but is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12 with input signals<br><br><br><br>
  to the integrating members 50al and 50a2,<br>
respectively, put in parenthesis. The corresponding output signals from the integrating members, that is, the phase-reference signals  are also indicated in<br>
parenthesis.<br>
Also the second embodiment of the invention, described above, may be formed to comprise simultaneous damping of several oscillation modes with different but given frequencies.<br>
The expression (6) above may then be generalized to read<br>
(18) <br>
By a reasoning analogous to that which, on the basis of the expression (6), results in the expression (7), the corresponding regression vector will have the form<br><br><br><br>
The expression (8) remains unchanged with the expression 0 according to the expression (9) replaced by the following relationship<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments shown but a plurality of modifications, which the person skilled in the art may carry out on the basis of the above descrip¬tion, are feasible within the scope of the claims. Thus, the power quantity, designated p(t)   in the figures, used in<br>
the description and characterizing for the power, may be replaced by a corresponding current signal, in which case it should be taken into consideration that, if the damping equipment is to operate with oscillations intersecting the zero line, that is, the power changes direction, the signal shall be provided with signs which indicate the direction of the power transport in the transmission line to give a correct function for the damping equipment. Also other measurement signals may be useful for controlling damping equipment and may be utilized within the scope of the invention. In transmission lines with double parallel circuits, the total power signal for both circuits may be more suited for controlling the damping equipment than the power signal from one circuit only, since the damping equipment otherwise tends to move the power flow between the parallel circuits along the same transmission path.<br><br>
