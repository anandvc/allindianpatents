BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus that enables<br>
the computation of a signal in a certain subspace, its projection that lies outside the<br>
subspace, and the orthogonal basis for a given matrix. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to the use of such a method or apparatus for real-time hardware<br>
applications since the method and apparatus may be utilized without matrix inversions<br>
or square root computations.<br><br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In spread spectrum systems, whether it is a communication system, a<br>
Global Positioning System (GPS) or a radar system, each transmitter may be assigned a<br>
unique code and in many instances each transmission from a transmitter is assigned a<br>
unique code. The code is nothing more than a sequence (often pseudorandom) of bits.<br>
Examples of codes include the Gold codes (used in GPS - see Kaplan, Elliot D., Editor,<br>
Understanding GPS: Principles and Applications, Artech House, 1996), Barker codes<br>
(used in radar - see Stimson, G.W., "AN Introduction to Airborne Radar", SciTech<br>
Publishing Inc., 1998), Walsh codes (used in communications systems like CDMAOne<br>
and CDMA2000 - See IS-95 and IS2000 Standards). These codes may be used to<br>
spread the signal so that the resulting signal occupies some specified range of<br>
frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum or the codes may be superimposed on<br>
another signal which might also be a coded signal.<br>
Assigning a unique code to each transmitter allows the receiver to distinguish<br>
between different transmitters. An example of a spread spectrum system that uses<br>
unique codes to distinguish between transmitters is a GPS system.<br>
If a single transmitter has to broadcast different messages to different receivers,<br>
such as a base-station in a wireless communication system broadcasting to different<br>
mobiles, one may use codes to distinguish between the messages for each mobile. In<br>
this scenario, each bit for a particular user is encoded using the code assigned to that<br>
user. By coding in this manner, the receiver, by knowing its own code, may decipher<br>
the message intended for it from the composite signal transmitted by the transmitter.<br>
In some communication systems, a symbol is assigned to a sequence of bits that<br>
make up a message. For example, a long digital message may be grouped into sets of M<br>
bits and each one of these sets of M bits is a assigned to a symbol. For example, if M=6,<br><br>
then each set of 6 bits may assume one of 26 = 64 possibilities. One such possibility is<br>
101101. Such a system would broadcast a unique waveform, called a symbol, to<br>
indicate to the receiver the sequence of bits. For example, the symbol a might denote<br>
the sequence 101101 and the symbol β might denote the sequence 110010. In the<br>
spread spectrum version of such a system, the symbols are codes. An example of such a<br>
communication system is the mobile to base-station link of CDMAOne or IS-95.<br>
In some instances, such as in a coded radar system, each pulse is assigned a<br>
unique code so that the receiver is able to distinguish between the different pulses based<br>
on the codes.<br>
Of course, all of these techniques may be combined to distinguish between<br>
transmitters, messages, pulses and symbols all in one single system. The key idea in all<br>
of these coded systems is that the receiver knows the codes of the message intended for<br>
it and by applying the codes correctly, the receiver may extract the message intended for<br>
it. However, such receivers are more complex than receivers that distinguish between<br>
messages by time and/or frequency alone. The complexity arises because the signal<br>
received by the receiver is a linear combination of all the coded signals present in the<br>
spectrum of interest at any given time. The receiver has to be able to extract the<br>
message intended for it from this linear combination of coded signals.<br>
The following section presents the problem of interference in linear algebraic<br>
terms followed by a discussion of the current, generic (baseline) receivers.<br><br>
Let H be a vector containing the spread signal from source no.l and let θ1 be the<br>
amplitude of the signal from this source. Let si be the spread signals for the remaining<br>
sources and let i be the corresponding amplitudes. Suppose the receiver is interested in<br>
source number 1, the signals from the other sources may be considered to be<br>
interference. Then, the received signal is:<br><br>
where n is the additive noise term, and p is the number of sources in the CDMA system.<br>
Let the length of the vector y be N, where N is the number of points in the integration<br>
window. This number N is selected as part of the design process as part of the trade-off<br>
between processing gain and complexity. A window of N points of y will be referred to<br>
as a segment.<br>
In a wireless communication system, the columns of the matrix H represent the<br>
various coded signals and the elements of the vector 0 are the powers of the coded<br>
signals. For example, in the base-station to mobile link of a CDMAOne system, the<br>
coded signals might be the various channels (pilot, paging, synchronization and traffic)<br>
and all their various multi-path copies from different base-stations. In the mobile to<br>
base-station link, the columns of the matrix H might be the coded signals from the<br>
mobiles and their various multi-path copies.<br>
In a GPS system, the columns of the matrix H are the coded signals being<br>
broadcast by the GPS satellites at the appropriate code, phase and frequency offsets.<br>
In an array application, the columns of the matrix are the steering vectors or<br>
equivalently the array pattern vectors. These vectors characterize the relative phase<br>
recorded by each antenna in the array as a function of the location and motion dynamics<br>
of the source as well as the arrangement of the antennas in the array. In the model<br><br>
presented above, each column of the matrix H signifies the steering vector to a<br>
particular source.<br>
The equation (1) may now be written in the following matrix form:<br><br>
where<br>
H: spread signal matrix of the source that the receiver is demodulating<br>
S = [S2 ... sp]: spread signal matrix of all the other sources, i.e., the interference<br>
 = [2 .• • p]: interference amplitude vector<br>
Receivers that are currently in use correlate the measurement, y, with a replica of<br>
H to determine if H is present in the measurement. If H is detected, then the receiver<br>
knows the bit-stream transmitted by source number 1. Mathematically, this correlation<br>
operation is:<br>
	1<br>
correlation function = (HTH) HTy	(3)<br>
where T is the transpose operation.<br>
Substituting for y from equation (2) illustrates the source of the power control<br>
requirement:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
It is the middle term, (HTH)-1HTS, in the above equation that results in the near-<br>
far problem. If the codes are orthogonal, then this term reduces to zero, which implies<br>
that the receiver has to detect 9 in the presence of noise (which is (HTH)-1HTri) only. It<br>
is easy to see that as the amplitude of the other sources increases, then the term<br>
 (HTH)-1HTS contributes a significant amount to the correlation function, which makes<br>
the detection of 9 more difficult.<br>
The normalized correlation function, (HTH)-1HT, defined above, is in fact the<br>
matched filter and is based on an orthogonal projection of y onto the space spanned by<br>
 H. When H and S are not orthogonal to each other, there is leakage of the components<br>
of S into the orthogonal projection of y onto H. This leakage is geometrically illustrated<br>
in Fig. 1. Note in Fig. 1, that if S were orthogonal to H, then the leakage component<br>
goes to zero as is evident from equation 4, above. The present invention addresses an<br>
efficient method for mitigating this interference when H and S are not orthogonal.<br><br>
Signal projection may be computed by means of performing the projection<br>
operation directly by computing PS=S(STS)_1ST and then computing the other desired<br>
quantities. This direct matrix inversion method requires computing the inverse, which<br>
may be prohibitive in hardware. In addition, the direct matrix inversion method cannot<br>
 handle a subspace matrix S that is singular.<br>
Signal projection may also be computed using Householder, Givens and Gram-<br>
Schmidt methods (QR methods). These methods may be used to decompose a given<br>
matrix into an orthonormal basis. In these QR methods, the subspace matrix is first<br>
 decomposed into its orthonormal representation and then the orthonormal representation<br>
is used to compute the projection of the signal. No matrix inverse computations are<br>
 required, but square root computations are needed in the computation of the<br>
orthonormal representation.<br><br><br>
Thus, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus that provide for signal<br>
projection computations in signal processing applications without the need for any<br>
matrix inversions or square root computations, as well as to provide for the handling of<br>
a subspace matrix S which is singular.<br>

apparatus that provide for signal projection computations in signal processing<br>
applications without the need for any matrix inversions or square root computations.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
It is advantageous to define several terms before describing the invention. It<br>
should be appreciated that the following definitions are used throughout this application.<br>
Definitions<br>
Where the definition of terms departs from the commonly used meaning of the<br>
term, applicant intends to utilize the definitions provided below, unless specifically<br>
indicated.<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "analog" refers to any<br>
measurable quantity that is continuous in nature.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "base station" refers to a<br>
transmitter and/or receiver that communicate(s) with multiple mobile or stationary units<br>
in a cellular environment.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "baseline receiver" refers to a<br>
receiver against which a receiver of the present invention is compared.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the terms "basis" and "basis vector"<br>
refer to a set of vectors that completely span the space under consideration. In 3-D<br>
space, any three linearly independent vectors comprise a basis for the 3-D space, and for<br>
2-D space, any 2 vectors that are linearly independent comprise a "basis."<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "bit" refers to the<br>
conventional' meaning of "bit," i.e. a fundamental unit of information having one of two<br>
possible values, a binary 1 or 0, or in bipolar binary terms, a -1 or a +1.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "Code-Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA)" refers to a method for multiple access in which all users share the<br>
same spectrum but are distinguishable from each other by a unique code.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "chip" refers to a non-<br>
information bearing unit that is smaller than a bit, the fundamental information bearing<br>
unit. For example, one bit is composed of multiple chips in an application that employs<br>
spreading. Depending on the amount of the spreading factor, a fixed length sequence of<br>
chips constitute a bit.<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "code offset" refers to a<br>
location within a code. For example, base stations in certain cellular environments<br>
distinguish between each other by their location within a particular pseudorandom code.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying<br>
drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific<br>
illustrative embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments<br>
are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the<br>
invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that<br>
logical, mechanical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to<br>
be taken in a limiting sense.<br><br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for computing the<br>
orthogonal basis for a matrix that is free of matrix inversions and square root<br>
computations. The present invention was developed in the context of signal processing<br>
applications and the removal of interference from coded signals. However, the<br>
application of the present invention is not limited to signal processing applications.<br>
Linear combinations of structured signals are frequently encountered in a<br>
number of diverse signal environments including wireless communications, Global<br>
Positioning Systems (GPS) and radar. In each of these application areas, the receiver<br>
observes a linear combination of structured signals in noise. Mathematically,<br><br>
where y is the received signal, the columns of the matrix H are the structured signal, 0 is<br>
the relative weight of each component and n is the additive background noise.<br>
In a wireless communication system, the columns of the matrix H represent the<br>
various coded signals and the elements of the vector 9 are the powers of the coded<br>
signals. For example, in the base-station to mobile link of a CDMAOne system, the<br>
coded signals may be the various channels (pilot, paging, synchronization and traffic)<br>
and all their various multi-path copies from different base-stations at the appropriate<br>
code, phase and frequency offsets, and carrying on it navigation information.<br>
In the mobile to base-station link, the columns of the matrix H may be the coded<br>
signals from the mobiles and their various multi-path copies.<br>
In a GPS system, the columns of the matrix H may be the coded signals being<br>
broadcast by the GPS satellites at the appropriate code, phase and frequency offsets.<br>
In an array application, the columns of the matrix may be the steering vectors or<br>
equivalently the array pattern vectors. These vectors characterize the relative phase<br><br>
recorded by each antenna in the array as a function of the location and motion dynamics<br>
of the source as well as the arrangement of the antennas in the array. In the model<br>
presented above, each column of the matrix H signifies the steering vector to a<br>
particular source.<br>
The goal of the receiver in each case is to extract one or more of the structured<br>
signals, i.e., the columns of the matrix H, from the measured signal y. In some<br>
instances, the goal of the receiver is also to estimate the elements of the vector 0<br>
corresponding to the columns of interest. However, the remaining columns of the<br>
matrix of H, though not of interest to the receiver, will be a source of interference. This<br>
interference may be significant enough to impede the ability of the receiver to detect and<br>
extract the signal, i.e., column of H and relative weight, of interest. This problem is<br>
illustrated below using a CDMA example.<br>
Let if be a vector containing the spread signal from source no.l and let 0i be the<br>
amplitude of the signal from this source. Let st be the spread signals for the remaining<br>
sources and let §\ be the corresponding amplitudes. Supposing that the receiver is<br>
interested in source number 1, the signals from the other sources may be considered to<br>
be interference. Then, the received signal is:<br><br>
where n is the additive noise term, and p is the number of sources in the CDMA system.<br>
Let the length of the vector y be m, where m is the number of points in the integration<br>
window. The number m is selected as part of the design process as part of the trade-off<br>
between processing gain and complexity. A window of m points of y is referred to<br>
herein as a segment.<br>
The above equation is written below in the following matrix form:<br><br><br>
where<br>
H- spread signal matrix of the source that the receiver is demodulating,<br>
S = [S2 ... sp]; spread signal matrix of all the other sources, i.e., the interference, and<br>
  interference amplitude vector.<br>
Receivers that are currently in use correlate the measurement, y, with a replica of<br>
H to determine if H is present in the measurement. If H is detected, then the receiver<br>
knows the bit-stream transmitted by source number 1. Mathematically, this correlation<br>
operation is:<br>
correlation function =  <br>
where T is the transpose operation.<br>
Substituting for y from equation (2) illustrates the source of the power control<br>
requirement:<br><br>
It is the middle term,   in the above equation that results in the<br>
near-far problem. If the codes are orthogonal, then this term reduces to zero, which<br>
implies that the receiver has to detect 9 in the presence of noise (which is <br>
only. It is easy to see that as the amplitude of the other sources increases, then the term<br><br>
  contributes a significant amount to the correlation function, which makes<br>
the detection of 9 more difficult.<br>
The normalized correlation function,  defined above, is in fact the<br>
matched filter and is based on an orthogonal projection of y onto the space spanned by<br>
H. When H and S are not orthogonal to each other, there is leakage of the components<br>
of S into the orthogonal projection of y onto H. This leakage is geometrically illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. Note in Figure 1 that if S were orthogonal to H, then the leakage<br>
component goes to zero as is evident from equation (4).<br>
One way to mitigate this interference is to remove the interference from y by<br>
means of a projection operation. Mathematically, a projection onto the space spanned<br>
by the columns of the matrix S is given by:<br><br>
A projection onto the space perpendicular to the space spanned by the columns<br>
of S is obtained by subtracting the above projection Ps from the identity matrix (a matrix<br>
with ones on the diagonal and zeros everywhere else). Mathematically, this projection<br>
is represented by:<br><br>
The projection matrix Ps has the property that when it is applied to a signal of<br>
S
the type S§, i.e., this is a signal that lies in the space spanned by the columns of S, it<br>
completely removes no matter what the value of <j i.e. it is magnitude independent.></j>
This cancellation is illustrated below:<br><br><br>
When applied to our measurement vector y, it cancels the interference terms:<br><br>
The hardware realization of this projection operation and interference<br>
cancellation presents certain complexities and hurdles, overcoming which are the main<br>
objectives of this invention.<br>
In general, using  to compute   requires the computation of the<br>
Grammian of S (where S is an m x p matrix), which requires mp2 mathematical floating<br>
point operations (flops) and computing its inverse, which requires additional p* flops.<br>
Clearly, the computation of the inverse of the Grammian is difficult,<br>
time-consuming and expensive, and progressively more so as p increases. It is also<br>
potentially unstable when there are singularities in S. Singularities in S would occur if<br>
any of its columns were to be linearly dependent on a set of vectors comprising any of<br>
its other columns, and thus an entire row and column of the Grammian becomes<br>
identically zero. This would result in an inability to compute the inverse of the<br>
Grammian, and consequently, hamper any computations downstream from that step.<br>
Even in the absence of any singularities, performing matrix inverses in hardware<br>
implementation, especially in the fixed-point implementations that are likely to be used<br>
in practical implementations, can present complications. For a detailed discussion on<br>
this issue, see Rick A. Cameron, 'Fixed-Point Implementation of a Multistage<br>
Receiver', PhD Dissertation, January 1997, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State<br>
University, the entire contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference hi its entirety.<br>
One alternative to computing the inverse of the Grammian directly is to<br>
decompose S using QR factorization methods into Q and R matrices, and then utilizing<br><br>
those in further computations. QR factorization may be performed using any one of the<br>
Householder, Givens, Fast Givens, Gram-Schmidt, or the modified Gram-Schmidt<br>
methods. These methods are discussed in detail in Golub G.H and C. F. Van Loan,<br>
Matrix Computations, Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1983, the entire<br>
contents and disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The set of Householder methods involve computations of the order of 4mp2 and<br>
provide more information than is needed for the projection operation and come with the<br>
added cost of increased computations. Givens methods may have potentially high<br>
overflows. The Gram-Schmidt and the modified Gram-Schmidt methods are<br>
computationally more efficient, but involve square root computations. Square roots are<br>
particularly difficult and expensive to implement at the chip level, because of the<br>
multiple clock cycles needed to compute a single square root.<br>
The present invention describes an apparatus for computing to compute the<br>
subspace projection of a signal via the computation of the inverse of the Grammian of<br>
the subspace that is free of both square roots and inverse computations, and hence is<br>
eminently suitable for real-time application on digital signal processors, FPGAs, ASICs<br>
and other realizations.<br>
For the purposes of the remaining description, the following nomenclature<br>
applies:<br>
S = m x p matrix containing the spread signal interference structure, composed<br><br>
y = m x 1 measurement vector;<br>
  vector whose components that lie in the space spanned by the<br>
columns of the matrix S have been projected out; and<br>
U = m x p orthogonal (but not orthonormal) basis for S composed of vectors<br><br><br>
In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, let u, = S!. Then,<br>
s2 may be resolved into a component that is parallel to s, and another component that<br>
is not. Then, u2 may be defined to be a component of s2 that is not in Sj.<br>
Then, s2 is given by the equation:<br><br>
where a:is the component of s2 that lies in sl9 and s2is expressed as a linear<br>
combination of sl and u2, where u2 is the new desired basis vector.<br>
Solving for a,, the following is obtained:<br><br>
or alternately, since u, = Sj,<br><br>
Thus, the second basis vector, u2 is the component of s2 that is not in u0<br>
illustrated geometrically in Figure 2. Moreover, the basis vectors Uj and u2 together<br>
span the same space that is spanned by s, and s2. Furthermore, Uj and u2 are<br>
orthogonal to each other;<br><br><br>
Now, let the two basis vectors be represented by: and proceed to<br>
find the next basis vector, u3.<br>
Next, decompose the vector s3 into a component that lies in the space spanned<br>
by the already computed basis vectors, U2 and a residual component that lies outside<br>
the space spanned by U2, which then becomes the next basis vector. This step is<br>
geometrically illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
Setting and solving for a2 and u3, the following is obtained:<br><br>
Mathematically, the third basis vector u3 is the third vector in the S matrix s3<br>
with those components that lie in the space spanned by the previous basis vectors, ut<br>
and u2, projected out.<br>
In terms of inputs, stored variables, and outputs, the implementation as the<br>
procedure unfolds can be visualized in Figure 4. A more detailed architecture showing<br>
the interactions between the different hardware elements are shown in Figure 5. These<br>
Figures are discussed in detail, below.<br><br>
The process of orthogonalization continues in the same manner, and at each step,<br>
the next basis vector is computed from the corresponding s vector by projecting out<br>
from the vector all its components that lie in the space spanned by the previously<br>
computed basis vectors. In case the incoming vector is linearly dependent on the<br>
previously computed basis vectors, the result of subtracting out its projection onto the<br>
previously computed basis from itself becomes approximately zero or at any other<br>
predetermined threshold level, i.e., to the order of machine precision, and this vector<br>
does not contribute significantly to the basis, and should therefore be excluded. This<br>
point is a tradeoff between accuracy and computational complexity. This discussion<br>
will assume that the desire is to have a system that is as accurate as possible.<br>
Proceeding along these lines, the i'h step becomes the calculation of the i'h basis vector<br>
u, and can be expressed as<br><br>
The process of computing the basis vector terminates at i=p with the calculation<br>
of the p"' basis vector up. Exploiting the fact that us u, is a scalar and its inverse<br>
therefore is a simple reciprocal; the i'h step of the iteration process for computing the<br>
basis vectors can be rewritten as<br><br><br>
If the last two equations are examined closely, it is found that the a, terms may<br>
be reused, and thereby their computation avoided at every step.   step<br>
essentially would consist then of multiplying pre-computed values of the reciprocal<br>
terms with the newly computed values (which can be computed most<br>
efficiently by first performing the operation and scaling the number obtained<br>
using to obtain another scalar number, and then finally scaling the vector u, using<br>
this scalar), and then subtracting out the sum of these products from the si+1 vector.<br>
If the result of the subtraction is zero (to the order of the chip precision), that<br>
vector is excluded from the basis and not used in further computations. It should be<br>
appreciated that any other level of precision may be utilized without departing from the<br>
teachings of the present invention.<br>
In a computationally constrained system, where memory is available freely, the<br>
  step could be sped up by storing and reusing the values of the  outer<br>
product.<br>
At this point, the matrix factorization for S has been completed and the<br>
following has been computed The vectors comprising U are all<br>
orthogonal to each other; where is a<br>
scalar inner product. Note that this property varies slightly from typical orthogonal<br>
factorizations, which are also orthonormal computations in that the 2-norm of all the<br>
basis vectors are unity, i.e. <br>
Recalling that the objective of the factorization was to arrive at a method to<br>
compute  without the need to compute square-roots and matrix inverses,<br>
factorization is used to substitute for S in the original equation:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Thus, the process of computing the interference free signal vector has been<br>
simplified to a computation that is numerically stable in the presence of singularities in<br>
S, and one that is free of both matrix inverses and square root computations.<br>
The projection of the signal vector onto the space spanned by the columns of S,<br>
ys, is given by the representation<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
implementation of the algorithm involves the building of an apparatus that takes in as<br>
inputs the matrix S (whose columns are the vectors, s) and the measurement signal<br>
vector y, and produces as output the yperp vector, after performing the operation of<br>
projecting out the portion of the signal that is represented by S.<br>
In this implementation, the input may be visualized as a stream of s vectors<br>
being input into the apparatus one at a time (of length m) followed at the end by the y<br>
vector (also of length m), with the vector being the desired output at the end of the<br>
computational process. Each step in real-time would begin with the input of the first s<br>
vector, and terminate with the output of the vector.<br>
An apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention may be built<br>
using the basic operations detailed below.<br>
Each step involves p iterations (one for each column in the S matrix), beginning<br>
with the input of the first column, s1, and ending with sp. It should be appreciated that<br>
the mathematical complexity of the system may be reduced by choosing p to be a<br><br>
number smaller than the number of columns in the S matrix. This sacrifices accuracy<br>
for simplicity but is still considered within the teachings of the present invention. The<br>
following discussion will assume that we are not making any accuracy compromises.<br>
The flow of variables and the interconnection between the different basic elements of<br>
the apparatus are shown in Figure 5, which describes the i+1* iteration being the input<br>
of the Si+1 vector and the computation of the ui+1 basis vector.<br>
The first step is the computation of the inner product of the Si+1 vector 500 and<br>
each of the previously computed and stored basis vectors, u1 through ui 502. This step is<br>
shown in Figure 6, and may be realized using a single Multiply-add-accumulator (MAC)<br>
503 i times in succession, or by using a bank of i MACs in parallel, depending on the<br>
tradeoff between the hardware costs and requirements of speed. For a detailed<br>
discussion on MACs please see U.S. patent 6,230,180, to Mohamed et. al, the entire<br>
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The i inner-products obtained 504 are each next multiplied by a scalar multiplier<br>
507 (shown in Figure 7) by their respective previously computed and stored 506 to<br>
produce the values 508 which are then used to scale the basis vectors from<br>
storage 510 (shown in Figure 8) to produce i vectors 512, which represent<br>
the components of the Si+1 vector that lie in the space spanned by each of the previously<br>
computed basis vectors. Scalar vector multiplier 509 performs the scaling. The stored<br>
  are preferably stored in memory 521.<br>
The steps shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8 may be realized either in serial or in<br>
parallel (with varying degrees of parallelism) depending on the speed versus hardware<br>
cost tradeoff.<br><br>
The vector sum of these components 514 is then obtained by vector adder 511<br>
(shown in Figure 9) which is then subtracted from the Si+1 vector 500 by subtractor 516<br>
(shown in Figure 10) to obtain the new basis vector ui+1 518. In the event that the Si+1<br>
vector is a linear combination of the previously computed basis vectors, the<br>
corresponding ui+1 would be zero, the verification of which is the next step 519 (shown<br>
in Figure 11).<br>
If ui+1 is zero, then that vector is excluded from the basis and not used in further<br>
computations. Even if ui+1 was not zero, but below a pre-determined threshold, it is<br>
excluded from the basis because cancellation is the subspace spanned by that particular<br>
interference vector will not produce sufficient gain in performance to warrant its use in<br>
the basis, and subsequently, for cancellation. Otherwise, the UI+1 is stored for use in<br>
future computations 520. In addition, the inner-product of the new basis vector ui+i with<br>
itself, uTi+iui+1 522 is computed using a MAC 521 (shown in Figure 12), and then its<br>
reciprocal is computed 524 (shown in Figure 13) and stored for use in the next iteration<br>
steps by element 523.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the inputs, stored variables, and the outputs for the different<br>
iteration steps, discussed above.<br>
All the above iteration steps are repeated p times until the input of the last sp<br>
vector, and its basis vector up computed, at which point the computation of the<br>
orthogonal basis for S is complete.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates the novel manner by which an apparatus according to the<br>
present invention may be used to compute ys which is the output at 1414 and yperp 1402,<br>
the components of a given signal y 1400 in the direction along and perpendicular to the<br>
space spanned by S, respectively. For this, the apparatus should first have computed the<br>
complete orthogonal basis for S as illustrated in Figure 5. As may be seen, many<br>
elements from Figure 5 may be utilized in this embodiment and respective reference<br>
numerals have been utilized.<br><br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, illustrated in<br>
Figure 15, the summation and the subtraction steps are replaced by a single serial<br>
subtractor, and the incoming value of 1501 is serially subtracted out from<br>
the Si+1 vector 1500, temporarily storing the result obtained, and then proceeding to<br>
subtract out the next incoming value of until all the values are processed,<br>
until the next basis vector ui+1 1520 is computed. As may be seen, many elements from<br>
Figure 5 may be utilized in this embodiment and respective reference numerals have<br>
been utilized.<br>
An apparatus of the present invention may be used in a variety of ways to<br>
achieve different signal processing objectives. Such an apparatus may be used to<br>
calculate the orthogonal (but not orthonormal) decomposition of a matrix S in the mode<br>
shown in Figure 16. In this mode of operation, the embodiment shown in Figure 5 may<br>
be used until all the basis vectors in 520 are computed, the set of which comprises the<br>
orthogonal basis for S. An apparatus of the present invention thus may be used to<br>
compute the orthogonal decomposition of a matrix S, even when it is derived for<br>
applications not specifically associated with a CDMA environment. Thus, the teachings<br>
of the present invention are not limited to processing signals in just the CDMA<br>
environment but to any digital signal.<br>
For implementing projections and canceling interference in a signal y where the<br>
interference lies in the subspace spanned by S, an apparatus of the present invention<br>
may be used in the mode shown in Figure 17. Here, an apparatus of the present<br>
invention may take as inputs the signal vector y, and the subspace matrix S, and produce<br>
as output the component that lies outside, In this mode of operation; first, the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 5 may be used to compute the basis vectors in 520, and<br>
upon completing the computation of the basis vector, the embodiment shown in Figure<br>
14 may be used, and the output at 1402 is <br><br>
In Figure 18, an apparatus of the present invention may be used to compute the<br>
component of y that lies in the subspace spanned by a matrix S, ys. In this mode of<br>
operation, the embodiment shown in Figure 5 may be used followed by the use of the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 14, and ys is the output at 1414 .<br>
In addition, the same apparatus could be used to compute the projection of a<br>
reference signal vector onto the space spanned by a matrix formed from a set of<br>
interference vectors, and the projection of a reference signal vector perpendicular to the<br>
space spanned by a matrix formed from a set of interference vectors. This would be<br>
useful in implementations in signal processing applications, where, rather than<br>
calculating the orthogonal projection of a signal in the space of the interference and then<br>
correlating it using the desired reference signal, the orthogonal projection of the desired<br>
reference signal in the space of the interference vectors is computed using this present<br>
invention, and then correlated with the original measurement signal. This teaching is<br>
also considered within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As an illustration of the use of this invention, Figure 19 shows an<br>
implementation of the Coded Signal Processing Engine (CSPE) that is designed for<br>
acquiring, tracking and demodulating pseudorandom (PN) coded signals in the presence<br>
of interference from other PN coded signals. One example of a PN coded signal is the<br>
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals that are used in communications<br>
systems.<br>
The operation of the structure is illustrated in Fig. 19. In Fig. 19 the<br>
architectural layout is presented of a single data processing channel for eliminating both<br>
cross-channel and co-channel interference. A single data processing channel is designed<br>
to acquire and track the signal from a single source.<br>
In the architecture presented, the single data processing channel consists of<br><br>
multiple fingers 800, 800' and 800" where each finger consists of a code generation<br>
module 802, 802' and 802"(for building the S matrix); P/ modules 804, 804' and 804";<br>
an acquisition module 810, 801, and 810" and a tracking module 812, 812' and 812".<br>
The tracking module, of course, consists of FLLs 822, 822' and 822"; PLLs 820, 820'<br>
and 820"; as well as DLLs 818, 818' and 818". Each processing finger 800, 800' and<br>
800" within a channel has the function of acquiring and tracking a distinct multipath<br>
signal from the same source.<br>
In order to understand how the architecture depicted in Fig. 19 works, the<br>
starting assumption may be used that this channel has just been assigned to track the<br>
signals from a particular source and that the system is already in the process of acquiring<br>
and tracking other sources or sources.<br>
The input data to this channel arrives in the form of a digital IF data stream.<br>
Since there are other sources being tracked, the replicate code generator module 802,<br>
802' and 802" would generate the appropriate S matrix and this matrix is used to create<br>
  804' and 804". In this case, the digital IF data streamy is provided as input into<br>
the module. The output of this module 804 is fed into the acquisition module 810 in<br>
the same finger.<br>
In case the system was not tracking any other sources, then there would be no S<br>
matrix generated and therefore no Ps1 function. In this case, the input digital IF data<br>
stream is passed directly into the acquisition stage.<br>
The acquisition stage acquires the signal and all its multipath copies from the<br>
source of interest. If the acquisition stage identifies more than one multipath, then<br>
multiple tracking sections are used for each multipath signal individually. The outputs<br>
of the tracking stages 812, 812' and/or 812" are the code, phase, and Doppler offsets<br><br>
that are used to build the S in the other channels. Furthermore, if all the available<br>
processing tracks are consumed, there is no need to mitigate any co-channel<br>
interference.<br>
Now suppose that due to co-channel interference, the acquisition stage 810, 810'<br>
or 810" was only able to acquire fewer multipaths than there are available processing<br>
fingers, i.e., the other multipath signals are buried in the co-channel interference. In that<br>
case, the information from the acquisition stage is used to track the first signals<br>
identified. The information about the code, phase and Doppler offsets of the first<br>
signals being tracked are obtained from the tracking system 812, 812' and/or 812" and<br>
are provided as input into the replicate code generators modules 802' and 802" in the<br>
same channel.<br>
The S matrix built in this finger now has included in it the code of the lone<br>
signal being processed in the finger 800. As a result, the finger 800' will eliminate<br>
interference from all the other sources as well as the dominant signal from the source of<br>
interest. The acquisition module 810' in this finger then acquires the multipath signal<br>
which is now visible because the interference from the dominant signal has been<br>
eliminated. That multipath is then tracked in 812' and the tracking information is<br>
provided to both the finger 800 (to improve its ability to track the dominant signal) as<br>
well as to the other fingers, e.g., 800" to aid in finding additional weak multipath<br>
signals. The tracking information from all these modules are used to perform the Rake<br>
operation 830 for data demodulation.<br>
