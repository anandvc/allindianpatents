FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to radiation curable coatings for use as a<br>
Primary Coating for optical fibers, optical fibers coated with said coatings and methods for the preparation of coated optical fibers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION       ;<br>
i<br>
r<br>
[0003]	Optical fibers are typically coated with two or more radiation curable<br>
.coatings. These coatings are typically applied to the optical fiber in liquid form, and then exposed to radiation to effect curing. The type of radiation that may be used to cure the coalings should be that which is capable of initiating the polymerization of one or more radiation curable components of such coatings. Radiation suitable for curing such coatings is well known, and<br>
 <br>
includes ultraviolet light (hereinafter "UV") and electron beam ("EB"). The preferred type of<br>
radiation for curing coatings used in the preparation of coated optical fiber is UV.<br>
[0004]	The coating which directly contacts the optical fiber is called the Primary<br>
Coating, and the coating that covers the Primary Coating is called the Secondary Coating. It is known in the art of radiation curable coatings for optical fibers that Primary Coatings are advantageously softer than Secondary Coatings. One advantage flowing from this arrangement<br>
is enhanced resistance to microbends<br>
[0005]       Microbends are sharp but microscopic curvatures in an optical fiber involving local<br>
i<br>
axial displacements of a few micrometers and spatial wavelengths of a few millimeters.<br>
i Microbends can be induced by thermal stresses and/or mechanical lateral forces. When present,<br>
microberrds attenuate the signal transmission capability of the coated optical fiber. Attenuation<br>
is the undesirable reduction of signal carried by the optical fiber. The relatively soft Primary<br>
Coating provides resistance to microbending of the optical fiber, thereby minimizing signal<br>
attenuation.<br>
[0006]       Published information on Radiation Curable Coatings suitable for use as a Primary<br>
i<br>
Coating for Optical Fiber include the following:<br>
[0007]       Published Chinese Patent Aoolicntion No. CN!651 5331. "Radiation Solidification<br>
Paint and Its Application", assigned to Shanghai Feikaj Photoelectric, inventors: Jibing Lin and<br>
i Jinshan Zhang, describes and claims a radiation curable coating, comprising oligomer, active<br>
diluent, photoinitiator, thermal stabilizer, selective adhesion promoter, in which a content of the<br>
oligomer is between 20% and 70% (by weight, the following is the same), a content of the other<br>
components is between 30% and 80%; the oligomer is selected from (meth) acrylated<br>
2<br>
 <br>
I] polyurethane oiigomer or a mixmre of (meth) acrylated polyurethane oligomer and (meth)<br>
acryiated epoxy oligomer; wherein said (meth) acrylated polyurethane oligomer is prepared by<br>
using at least the following substances:	;<br>
[0008]        (1)   one of poiyols selected from polyurethane polyol, polyamide polyol, polyether<br>
polyol, polyester polyol, polycarbonate polyol, hydrocarbon polyol, polysiloxane polyol, a<br>
mixture of two or more same or different kinds of polyol (s);<br>
[0009]      ] (2) a mixture of two or more diisocyanates or Polyisocyanates;<br>
[0010]        (3) (meth) acrylated compound containing one hydroxyl capable of reacting with<br>
isocyanate.<br>
[0011]       Example 3 of Published Chinese Patent Application No. CN16515331 is the only<br>
3 .'!<br>
Example in this published patent application that describes the synthesis of a radiation curable coating suitable for use as a Radiation Curable Primary Coating. The coating synthesized in Example 3 has an elastic modulus of 1.6 MPa.<br>
[0012]	The article, "UV-CURED POLYURETHANE-ACRYLIC COMPOSITIONS AS<br>
HARD EXTERNAL LAYERS OF TWO-LAYER PROTECTIVE COATINGS FOR OPTICAL FIBRES", authored by W. Podkoscielny and B. Tarasiuk , Polim.Tworz.Wielk, Vol. 41, Nos. 7/8, p.448-55, 1996, NDN- 131-0123-9398-2, describes studies of the optimization of synthesis of UV-cured urethane-acrylic oligomers and their use as hard protective coatings for optical fibers. Polish-made oligoetherols, diethylene glycol, tolulene diisocyanate (Izocyn T-80) and isophorone diisocyanate in addition to hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl methacrylates are used for the synthesis. Active diluents (butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and 1,4-butanediol acrylate or mixtures of these) and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as a photoinitiator are<br>
3	I<br>
 <br>
added to these urethane-acrylic oligomers which had polymerization-active double bonds. The compositions are UV-irradiated in an oxygen-free atmosphere. IR spectra of the compositions are recorded, and some physical and chemical and mechanical properties (density, molecular weight, viscosity as a function of temperature, refractive index, gel content, glass transition temperature, Shore hardness, Young's modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break, heat resistance and water vapor diffusion coefficient) are determined before and after curing. [0013]     ' The article, "PROPERTIES OF ULTRAVIOLET CURABLE POLYURETHANE-ACRYLATES", authored by M. Koshiba; K.K.S. Hwang; S.K. Foley.; D.J. Yarusso; and S. L. Cooper; published in J.Mat.ScL, 17,No.5,May 1982,p.1447-58; NDN- 131-0063-1179-2; described a study that is made of the relationship between the chemical structure and physical properties of UV cured polyurethane-acrylates based on isophorone diisocyanate and TDI. The two systems are prepared with varying soft segment molecular weight and cross linking agent content. Dynamic mechanical test results showed that one- or two-phase materials might be obtained, depending on soft segment molecular weight. As the latter increased, the polyol Tg<br>
shifted to lower temperatures: Increasing using either N-vinyl pyrroiidone (NVP) or polyethylene<br>
\ glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) caused an increase in Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength.<br>
i NVP cross ljnkin° increased toughness in the two-p^ase ^Qteri^ls and shifted the hi^h<br>
temperature Tg peak to higher temperatures, but PEGDA did not have these effects. Tensile<br>
properties of the two systems are generally similar.<br>
[0014] Typically in the manufacture of radiation curable coatings for use on Optical Fiber,<br>
isocyanates are used to make urethane oligomers. In many references, including U.S. Patent No.<br>

wherein the urethane-(meth)acrylate oligomer CA/CR comprises (meth)acrylate groups, at least one polyol backbone and urethane groups,<br>
wherein about 15% or more of the urethane groups are derived from one or both<br>
of 2,4- and 2,6-toluene diisocyanate,	]<br>

i<br>
 <br>
wherein at least 15% of the urethane groups are derived from a cyclic or<br>
i<br>
branched aliphatic isocyanate, and	wherein said (meth)acrylate functional oligomer has a number average molecular weight of from at least about 4000 g/mol to less than or equal to about 15,000 g/mol; and<br>
wherein a cured film of the radiation curable Primary Coating composition has a modulus of less than or equal to about 1.2 MPa.<br>
[0017]	The oligomers useful in the various aspects of the present invention will be<br>
described in the following sections. Generally, the oligomers are urethane (meth)acrylate<br>
oligomers, comprising a (meth)acrylate group, urethane groups and a backbone (the term<br>
(meth)acrylate including acrylates as well as methacrylate functionalities). The backbone is<br>
derived from use of a polyol which has been reacted with an aromatic diisocyanate and an<br>
aliphatic diisocyanate and hydroxy alky] (meth)acrylate, preferably hydroxyethylacrylate.<br>
[0018]	Surprisingly, it has been found that it is advantageous to use an 80/20 mixture of<br>
the 2,4- and 2,6- isomers of toluene diisocyanate rather than using TDS, which is 100% pure<br>
2,4-isomer of toluene diisocyanate.<br>
Oligomer A<br>
[0019]	Oligomer A is desirably prepared by reacting an acryiate (e.g., HEA) with an<br>
aromatic isocyanate (e.g., TDI); an aliphatic isocyanate (e.g., EPDI); a polyol (e.g., P2010); a<br>
catalyst (e.g., DBTDL); and an inhibitor (e.g., BHT).	.;<br>
[0020]	The aromatic and aliphatic isocyanates are well known, and commercially<br>
available. A preferred aromatic isocyanate is TDI, while a preferred aliphatic isocyanate is isophorone diisocycante.<br>
[0021]	When preparing oligomer A, the isocyanate component may be added to the<br>
oligomer reaction mixture in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 25 wt.%, desirably from about 1.5 to 20 wt.%, and preferably from about 2 to about 15 wt.%, all based on the weight percent of the oligomer mixture.<br>
ii<br>
 <br>
[0022]	Desirably, the isocyanates should include more aliphatic isocyanate than<br>
aromatic isocyanate. More desirably, the ratio of aliphatic to aromatic isocyanate may range<br>
from about 6:1, preferably from about 4:1, and most preferably from about 3:1.<br>
[0023]	A variety of polyols may be used in the preparation of the oligomer.<br>
Examples of suitable polyols are polyether polyols, polyester polyols, polycarbonate polyols,<br>
polycaprolactone polyols, acrylic polyols, and the like. These polyols may be used either<br>
individually or in combinations of two or more. There are no specific limitations to the manner<br>
of polymerization of the structural units in these polyols; any of random polymerization, block<br>
polymerization, or graft polymerization is acceptable. Preferably, P2010 (BASF) is used.<br>
[0024]	When preparing oligomer A, the polyol component may be added to the<br>
oligomer reaction mixture in any suitable amount, desirably ranging from about 20 to 99 wt.%, more desirably from about 40 to 97 wt.%, and preferably from about 60 to about 95 wt.%, all based on the weight percent of the oligomer mixture.<br>
[0025]	The number average Molecular Weight of the polyols suitable for use in the<br>
preparation of the oligomer may range from about 500 to about 8000, desirably from about 750<br>
to about 6000, and preferably from about 1000 to about 4000.<br>

[0026]	The acrylate component useful in the preparation of oligomer A may be of<br>
any suitable type, but is desirably a hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylate, preferably<br>
hydroxyethylacrylate (HEA). When preparing oligomer A, the acrylate component may be<br>
added to the oligomer reaction mixture in any suitable amount, desirably from about 1 to 20<br>
wt.%, more desirably from about 1.5 to 10 wt.%, and preferably from about 2 to about 4 wt %,<br>
all based on the weight of the oligomer reactant mixture.	]<br>

[0090] One or more reactive monomer diluents may also be added to the curable composition; such diluents are well known in the art. A variety of diluents are known in the art and may be used in the preparation of the oligomer including, without limitation, alkoxylated alky] substituted phenol acryiate, such as ethoxylated nonyl phenol acryiate (ENPA), propoxylated nonyl phenol acryiate (PNPA), vinyl monomers such as vinyl caprolactam (nVC), isodecyl acryiate (IDA), (2-)ethyl-hexyl acryiate (ERA), di-ethyleneglycol-ethyl-hexylacrylate (DEGEHA), iso-bomyl acryiate (EBOA), tri-propyleneglycol-diacrylate (TPGDA), hexande-diol-diacrylate (HDDA), trimethylolpropane-triacrylate (TMPTA), alkoxylated trimethylolpropane-triacrylate, and alkoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate such as ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate (EO-BPADA). Preferably, Photomer 4066 is used as a diluent. The total amount of diluent in the curable composition may vary depending on the desired properties, but will desirably range from about 20 to 80 wt.%, more desirably from about 30 to 70 wt.%, and preferably from about 40 to about 60 wt.%, based on the weight percent of the radiation curable composition. [0091] The curable composition may also desirably include one or more photoinitiators. Such components are well known in the art. When present, the photoinitiators should be included in<br>
 <br>
amounts ranging from about 0.5 wt.% to about 3 wt.% of the curable composition, and<br>

[0092] A further component that may be used in the curable composition is an antioxidant. Such<br>
components also are well known in the art. When present, the antioxidant component may be<br>
included in amounts ranging from about 0.2 to about 1 wt.% of the curable composition.<br>

Preferably, the antioxidant is Irganox 1035.<br>
[0094] Another component desirably included in the curable composition is an adhesion<br>
promoter which, as its name implies, enhances the adhesion of the cured coating onto the optical<br>
fiber. Such components are well known in the art. When present, the adhesion promoter may be<br>

Preferably, the adhesion promoter is A-189.	,<br>
[0095] The foregoing components may be mixed together to provide the radiation curable<br>
coating. Desirably, the oligomer, diluent monomer, photoinitiator, and antioxidant are mixed<br>
and heated at 70°C for about 1 hour to dissolve all the powdery material. Then, the temperature<br>

i<br>
may then be covered with a Secondary Coating, which is also desirably radiation curable.<br>
Suitable Secondary Coatings are commercially available. The radiation curable Secondary<br>
Coating may be any commercially available radiation curable Secondary Coating for optical<br>

[00106]	If desired, an ink material may be applied on the coated optica] fiber in order<br>

[00107]	The cured Primary Coatings described herein desirably have properties are<br>
described in the following paragraphs.<br>
[00108]	The zero shear viscosity at 23°C of the uncured coatings described herein are<br>

[00109]	The refractive index of the coatings described herein is preferably about 1.48<br>
or higher, and more preferable about 1.51 or higher.<br>
[00110]	The elongation-at-break of the cured Primary Coatings is desirably greater<br>
than about 50%, preferably greater than about 60%, more preferably at least about 100%, but<br>
preferably no higher than about 400%. This elongation-at-break may be measured at a speed of<br>
5 mm/min, 50 mm/min or 500 mm/min respectively, and preferably at 50 mm/min.<br>
[00111]	The equilibrium modulus, as tested on a cured film of the Primary Coating is<br>
preferably about 2 MPa or less, preferably about 1.5 MPa or less, more preferably about 1.2 MPa<br>
or less, even more preferably about 1.0 MPa or less and most preferred about 0.8 MPa or less.<br>
Desirably, this value is about 0.1 MPa or higher, and more desirably about 0.3 MPa or higher.<br>
[00112]	The Tg of the cured Primary Coating (defined as the peak-tan 5 in a DMA<br>
curve) is desirably about 0°C or lower, more desirably about -15°C or lower, and most desirably<br>
about -25°C or lower, with the Tg preferably also being about -55 °C or higher.<br>
[00113]	The viscosity and elasticity of the coalings may be measured as explained<br>
below.<br>
[00114]	Together with the zero-shear viscosity (rio), the steady state compliance (Je)<br>
largely determines the Theological behaviour of the uncured coating composition. Whereas the<br>
zero-shear viscosity is a measure for the viscous behaviour of the liquid, the steady state<br>
compiiance measures the elasticity of the liquid. Highly elastic liquids are unfavourable because<br>
 <br>
of the mentioned issues in handling. For a detailed description of these rheological parameters<br>
and their interrelation reference is made to pages 109-133 of the book "Rheology: principles,<br>
measurements and applications" by C. W. Macosko (VCH Publishers 1994) which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Although both parameters axe determined at low shear rate,<br>
they determine the flow curve as a whole over a broad range of shear rates.1<br>
[00115]	Experimentally, it is difficult to accurately determine the steady state<br>
compliance because it requires liquid elasticity measurements at very low shear rates and/or<br>
frequencies (when performing dynamic measurements). In a good approximation, the liquid<br>
elasticity may be measured (using dynamic mechanical measurements on the liquid uncured<br>
coating) from the value of the shear storage modulus G' at a fixed low value of the loss modulus<br>
G" (e.g. at 100 Pa). A higher value of G' indicates a more elastic liquid. It has been found that<br>
uncured coatings with a shear storage modulus G' less than 0.8 Pa, at a loss modulus G" of 100<br>
Pa, are easy to handle. Preferably, then, G' at G"=100 Pa is less than 0.6 Pa, even more<br>
preferably less than 0.5 Pa and most preferably less than 0.4 Pa.	]<br>
[00116]	By way of example, a polyether ureth an e-aery late oligomer CA/CR<br>

[00117]	In a good approximation of the zero shear viscosity, it has been found that<br>
one may use the dynamic viscosity at 20°C and at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s as a measure of the viscosity of the uncured liquid. The viscosity in this regard is desirably about 1 Pascal • s or higher, more desirably about 2 Pascal -s or higher, and even more desirably about 3 Pascal-s.<br>

Examples	;<br>
First Set of Test Methods for Liquid Coating and Cured Films	)<br>
I<br>
\ Tensile Strength. Elongation, and Modulus Test Method<br>
[00119]	The tensile properties (tensile strength, percent elongation at break, and<br>
modulus) of cured samples are determined using an lnstron model 4201 universal testing instrument. Sampies are prepared for testing by curing a 75-um film of the material using a Fusion UV processor. Samples are cured at 1.0 J/cm2 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Test specimens having a width of 0.5 inches and a length of 5 inches are cut from the film. The exact thickness of each specimen is measured with a micrometer.<br>
[00120]	For relatively soft coatings (e.g., those with a modulus of less than about 10<br>
MPa), the coating is drawn down and cured on a glass plate and the individual specimens cut from the glass plate with a scalpel, A 2-lb load cell is used in the lnstron and modulus is calculated at 2.5% elongation with a least squares fit of the stress-strain plot. Cured films are conditioned at 23.0 + 0.1°C and 50.0 + 0.5% relative humidity for a minimum of one hour prior to testing.<br>
[00121]	For relatively harder coatings, the coating is drawn down on a Mylar film and<br>
specimens are cut with a Thwing Albert 0.5-inch precision sample cutter. A 20-lb load cell is<br>
i<br>
used in the lnstron and modulus is calculated at 2.5% elongation from the secant at that point.<br>
Cured films are conditioned at 23.0 + 0.1°C and 50.0 + 0.5% relative humidity for sixteen hours<br>
prior to testing.	j<br>
[00122]	For testing specimens, the gage length is 2-inches and the crosshead speed is<br>
1.00 inches/minute. All testing is done at a temperature of 23.0+0.1°C and a relative humidity of<br>
50.0+0.5%. All measurements are determined from the average of at least 6 test specimens.<br>
DMA Test Method	!<br>
[00123]	Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) is carried out on the test samples<br>
using an RSA-II instrument manufactured by Rheometric Scientific Inc. A free film specimen<br>
(typically about 36 mm long, 12 mm wide, and 0.075 mm thick) is mounted in the grips of the<br>
 <br>
instrument, and the temperature initially brought to S0°C and held there for about five minutes. During the latter soak period at 80°C, the sample is stretched by about 2.5% of its original length. Also during this time, information about the sample identity, its dimensions, and the specific test method is entered into the software (RSI Orchestrator) residing on the attached personal computer.<br>
[00124]	All tests are performed at a frequency of 1.0 radians, with the dynamic<br>
temperature step method having 2°C steps, a soak time of 5 to 10 seconds, an initial strain of about 0.001 (.DELTA.L/L), and with autotension and autostrain options activated. The autotension is set to ensure that the sample remained under a tensile force throughout the run, and autostrain is set to allow the strain to be increased as the sample passed through the glass transition and became softer. After the 5 minute soak time, the temperature in the sample oven is reduced in 20°C steps until the starting temperature, typically -80°C or -60°C is reached. The final temperature of the run is entered into the software before starting the run, such that the data for a sample would extend from the glassy region through the transition region and well into the rubbery region.<br>
[00125]	The run is started and allowed to proceed to completion! After completion of<br>
the run, a graph of E'=Tensile Storage Modulus, E"=Tensile Loss Modulus, and tan delta, all<br>
versus temperature, appeared on the computer screen. The data points on each curve are<br>
smoothed, using a program in the software. On this plot, three points representing the glass<br>
transition are identified:	J<br>
[00126]	1) The temperature at which Tensile Storage Modulus^ E'=1000 MPa;<br>
[00127}	2) The temperature at which Tensile Storage Modulus^ E'=100 MPa;<br>
[00128]	3) The temperature of the peak in the tan delta curve. If the tan delta curve<br>
contained more than one peak, the temperature of each peak is measured. One additional value obtained from the graph is the minimum value for Tensile Storage Modulus= EE' in the rubbery region. This value is reported as the equilibrium modulus, Eo-<br>
 <br>
Measurement of Dry and Wet Adhesion	)<br>
[00129]	Detertninalion of dry and wet adhesion is performed using an lnstron model<br>
4201 universal testing instrument. A 75 p.m film is drawn down on a polished TLC glass plate<br>
and cured using a Fusion UV processor. Samples are cured at 1.0 J/cma in a nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
[00330]	The samples are conditioned at a temperature of 23.±0.1 :°C. and a relative<br>
humidity of 50. ±0.5% for a period of 7 days. After conditioning, eight specimens are cut 6 inches long and I inch wide with a scalpel in the direction of the draw down. A thin layer of laic is applied to four of ihe specimens. The first inch of each sample is peeled back from the glass. The glass is secured to a horizontal support on the lnstron with the affixed end of the specimen adjacent to a pulley attached to the support and positioned directly underneath the crosshead. A wire is attached to the peeled-back end of the sample, run along the specimen and then run through the pulley in a direction perpendicular to the specimen. The free end of the wire is clamped in the upper jaw of the lnstron, which is then activated. The test is continued until the average force value, in grams force/inch, became relatively constant. The crosshead speed is 10 in/min. Dry adhesion is the average of the four specimens.<br>
[00131]	The remaining four specimens are then conditioned at 23. ± 0.1°C. and a<br>
relative humidity of 95. ± 0.5% for 24 hours. A thin layer of a polyethylene/water slurry is applied to the surface of the specimens. Testing is then performed as in the previous paragraph. Wet adhesion is the average of the four specimens. Water Sensitivity<br>
[00132]	A layer of the composition is cured to provide a UV cured coating test strip<br>
(1.5 inch times 1.5 inch times 0.6 mils). The test strip is weighed and placed in a vial containing deionized water, which is subsequently stored for 3 weeks at 23°C. At periodic intervals, e.g. 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days, the test strip is removed from the vial and gently patted dry with a paper towel and reweighed. The percent water absorption is reported as 100*(weight after immersion-weight before immersion)/(weight before immersion). The peak water absorption is the highest water absorption value reached during the 3-week immersion period. At the end of the 3-week period,<br>
 <br>
the test strip is dried in a 60°C oven for 1 hour, cooled in a desiccator tor lb minutes, ana reweighed. The percent water extractables is reported as I00*(weight before immersion-weight after drying)/(weight before immersion). The water sensitivity is reported as [peaJc water absorptionl+jwater extractables|. Three test strips are tested to improve the accuracy of the test.<br>
Refractive Index<br>
[00133]	The refractive index of the cured compositions is determined with the Becke<br>
Line method, which entails matching the refractive index of finely cut strips'of the cured<br>
composition with immersion liquids of known refraction properties. The test is performed under<br>
a microscope at 23°C and with light having a wavelength of 589 nm.	j<br>
Viscosity<br>
(00134]	The viscosity is measured using a Physica MC10 Viscometer. The test<br>
samples are examined and if an excessive amount of bubbles is present, steps are taken to<br>
remove most of the bubbles. Not all bubbles need to be removed at this stage, because the act of<br>
sample loading introduces some bubbles.<br>
[00135]	The instrument is set up for the conventional Z3 system, which is used. The<br>
samples are loaded into a disposable aluminum cup by using the syringe to measure out 17 cc.<br>
The sample in the cup is examined and if it contains an excessive amount of bubbles, they are<br>
removed by a direct means such as centrifugation, or enough time is allowed to elapse to let the<br>
bubbles escape from the bulk of the liquid. Bubbles at the top surface of the liquid are<br>
acceptable.<br>
[00136]	The bob is gently loared into the liquid in the measuring cup, and the cup an&gt;<br>
bob are installed in the instrument. The sample temperature is allowed to equilibrate with the<br>
temperature of the circulating liquid by waiting five minutes. Then, the rotational speed is set to<br>
a desired value which will produce the desired shear rate. The desired value of the shear rate is<br>
easily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art from an expected viscosity range of the<br>
sample. The shear rate is typically 50 sec"' or 100 sec"1.<br>
37<br>
 <br>
[00137]     The instalment panei reads out a viscosity value, and if the viscosity value varied only slightly (less than 2% relative variation) for 15 seconds, the measurement is complete. If not, it is possible lhai the temperature had not yet reached an equilibrium value, or that the material is changing due to shearing. If the latter case, further testing at different shear rates will be needed to define the sample's viscous properties. The results reported are the average viscosity values of three test samples. The results are reported either in centipoise (cps) or milliPascal • seconds (mPa * s), which are equivalent. [00138]<br>

Determination of the dynamic viscosity at 20°C and the "shear storage modulus" also known as<br>
liquid elasticitv=G' at shear loss modulus = G"=100 Pa<br>
[0100]       The dynamic shear viscosity at 10 rad/s, rj(10rad/s, 20°C), and the liquid elasticity G'  -<br>
at G"=100 Pa of the uncured coating compositions are determined from dynamic mechanical<br>
measurements. These dynamic mechanical measurements are performed with a Rheometric<br>
Scientific (now TA instruments) ARES-LS rheometer equipped with a dual range 200-2000<br>
g*cm force rebalance torque transducer, a 25 mm Invar parallel plate geometry, a nitrogen gas<br>
oven and a liquid nitrogen cooling facility.	■<br>
[0101]       At the start of the experiments, the resin sample is loaded between the parallel plate<br>
I geometry of the rheometer at room temperature. The plate-plate distance is set to 1.6 mm. After<br>
closing of the gas oven, the sample is purged with nitrogen gas for about 5 minutes.<br>
[0102]	The experiment is run by performing isothermal frequency sweeps with angular<br>
frequencies between 100 and 0.1 rad/s (3 frequencies per decade, measured in decreasing order)<br>
at 5°C temperature intervals, starting with 20 °C and lowering the temperature in 5 °C steps until<br>
the sample becomes too stiff for the instrument to measure (for the cited examples this limit is<br>
typically passed between about -20 °C and about -30 °C). At the start of the frequency sweep<br>
the strain amplitude is set to 2%. For accurate viscosity and phase angle determination, care has<br>
to be taken that the dynamic torque amplitude is higher than 0.5 g*cm. With decreasing<br>
measurement frequency the torque will decrease. Therefore, upon approaching this lower limit,<br>
the strain is increased to 5% and in the next step to 20% to keep the torque above the minimum<br>
.1 allowed value of 0.5 g*cm. Typically, the measurements of the dynamic viscosity at 20°C and 10<br>
rad/s and of the shear storage modulus G' at a loss modulus G"of 100 Pa'are performed at a<br>
strain amplitude of 20%.	j<br>
[0103}       The shear storage modulus G', the loss modulus G", the dynamic modulus G*=<br>
(G" +G  ) " , the dynamic viscosity r|*= co*G* and the phase angle (5) are collected as a function<br>
 <br>
of the angular frequency.'Data points collected at a dynamic torque less than 0.5g*cm are removed from the results.<br>
[0104]       The dynamic viscosity at 10 rad/s is obtained from the frequency sweep measured at 20DC. G' at G"=100 Pa is derived from the frequency sweep at the highest temperature at which a value of G" between 100 and 200Pa is measured, by linear extrapolation of log, G' , vs. log, G" , from the two lowest frequency data points to G"=100 Pa. In most cases this result can be<br>
obtained from the frequency sweep at 10 or 0°C.	s<br>

[0106]       The modulus of the cured coating is measured with dynamic mechanical analysis,<br>
using a Rheometrics RDA-2 dynamic mechanical analyzer. For this purpose a 100 microns thick<br>
layer of the liquid coating is placed between two quartz parallel plates with a diameter of 9.5 mm<br>
as described in detail in 'Steeman c.s., Macrotnolecules, Vol. 37, No. 18, 2004, p700J-7007which is incorporated herein by reference. The coating is fully cured by illumination with UV<br>
light (25 mW/cm2) for 60 seconds and monitoring the modulus build up with the method<br>
described in the enclosed reference. After this cure measurement a frequency sweep is performed<br>
on the fully cured sample with a strain amplitude of 10%. From this frequency sweep, the value<br>
of the shear storage modulus G' at a frequency of 1 rad/s is taken. The tensile modulus E of the<br>
cured coating is approximated by calculating three times this value of the shear shear storage<br>
modulus G'.<br>

j when using mixed diisocyanates (TDI and IPDI)to make the same oligomer (Examples of the<br>
Invention) in comparison with making the same oligomer with using only one isocyanate<br>
(TDI)(Comparative Examples-not Examples of the Invention).	;<br>
[0118]       The results shows a decrease in elastic behaviour (in most cases also a drop of the<br>
viscosity) and a decrease of the modulus of the cured coating when using a mixture of technical<br>
grade TDI and IPDI as compared to using just TDI.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0120]       The oligomers are made according the inside-out method described above. The coating compositions exhibited a largely Newtonian behavior.<br>
[0121] The viscosity is about 5.1 Pascal-s and 5.0 Pascal-s for composition I and II at 25 °C<br>
respectively. The equilibrium modulus (E') about 1 MPa and 0.9 MPa respectively. The Tg are<br>
-36 °C and -33 °C respectively.	.<br>

[0122]        Draw Tower Simulator<br>
[0123]        In the early years of optical fiber coaling developments, all newly developed primary<br>
and Secondary Coatings are first tested for their cured film properties and then submitted for<br>
evaluation on fiber drawing towers. Out of all the coatings that are requested to be drawn, it is<br>
estimated that at most 30% of them are tested on the draw tower, due to high cost and scheduling<br>
difficulties. The time from when the coating is first formulated to the time of being applied to<br>
glass fiber is typically about 6 months, which greatly slowed the product development cycle.<br>
[0124]       It is known in the art of radiation cured coatings for optical fiber that when either the<br>
Primary Coating or the Secondary Coating is applied to glass fiber, its properties often differ<br>
from the flat film properties of a cured film of the same coating. This is believed to be because<br>
the coating on fiber and the coating flat film have differences in sample size, geometry, UV<br>
intensity exposure, acquired UV total exposure, processing speed, temperature of the substrate,<br>
curing temperature, and possibly nitrogen inerting conditions.<br>
[00141]   ' Equipment that would provide similar curing conditions as those present at fiber<br>
manufacturers, in order to enable a more reliable coating development route and faster<br>
turnaround time has been developed. This type of alternative application and curing equipment<br>
needed to be easy to use, low maintenance, and offer reproducible performance. The name of<br>
the equipment is a "draw lower simulator" hereinafter abbreviated "DTS". Draw tower<br>
simulators are custom designed and constructed based on detailed examination of actual glass<br>
fiber draw tower components. All the measurements (lamp positions, distance between coating<br>
I stages, gaps between coating stages and UV lamps, etc) are duplicated from glass fiber drawing<br>
towers. This helps mimic the processing conditions used in fiber drawing industry.<br>
[00142]     One known DTS is equipped with five Fusion F600 lamps - two for the upper coating<br>
stage and three for the lower. The second lamp in each stage can be rotated at various angles<br>
between 15 - 135°, allowing for a more detailed study of the curing profile.<br>
[00143]     The "core" used for the known DTS is 130.0±1.0 fim stainless steel wire. Fiber<br>
drawing applicators of different designs, from different suppliers, are available for evaluation.<br>
 <br>
This configuration allows the application of optical fiber coatings at similar conditions that<br>
actually exist at indusLry production sites.<br>
[00144]     The draw tower simulator has already been used to expand the analysis of radiation<br>
curable coatings on optical fiber. A method of measuring the Primary Coating's in-situ modulus<br>
that can be used to indicate the coating's strength, degree of cure, and the fiber's performance<br>
under different environments in 2003 is reported by P. A. M. Steeman, J J. M. Slot, H. G. H. van<br>
Melick, A. A. F. v.d. Ven, H. Cao, and R. Johnson, in the Proceedings of the 52nd fWCS, p.246<br>
(2003). In 2004, Steeman et at reported on how the rheological high shear profile of optical fiber<br>
coatings can be used to predict the coatings' processability at faster drawing speeds P. A. M.<br>
i Steeman, W. Zoetelief, H. Cao, and M. Bulters, Proceedings of the 53rd rWCS, p. 532 (2004).<br>
The draw tower simulator can be used to investigate further the properties of primary and<br>
i<br>
Secondary Coatings on an optical fiber.<br>
[00145]     These test methods are useful for Primary Coatings on wire or coatings on optical<br>

fiber:	,:<br>
[00146]     Test Methods<br>
[00147]     Percent Reacted Acrylate Unsaturation for the Primary Coating abbreviated as %<br>
RAU Primary Test Method:<br>
[00148]     Degree of cure on the inside Primary Coating on an optical fiber or metal wire is<br>
determined by FDR using a diamond ATR accessory. FTER instrument parameters include: 100<br>
co-added scans, 4 cm'1 resolution, DTGS detector, a spectrum range of 4000 - 650 cm" , and an<br>
approximately 25% reduction in the default mirror velocity to improve signal-to-noise. Two<br>
spectra are required; one of the uncured liquid coating that corresponds to the coating on the<br>
fiber or wire and one of the inner Primary Coating on the fiber or wire. A thin film of contact<br>
cement is smeared on the center area of a 1-inch square piece of 3-mil Mylar film. After the<br>
contact cement becomes tacky, a piece of the optical fiber or wire is placed in it. Place the<br>
sample under a low power optical microscope. The coatings on the fiber or wire are sliced<br>
through to the glass using a sharp scalpel. The coalings are then cut lengthwise down the top<br>
side of the fiber or wire for approximately 1 centimeter, making sure that the cut is clean and that<br>
the outer coating does not fold into the Primary Coating. Then the coatings are spread open onto<br>
i<br>
 <br>
the contact cement such that the Primary Coating next to the glass or wire is exposed as a flat film. The glass fiber or wire is broken away in the area where the Primary Coating is exposed. [00149]     The spectrum of the liquid coating is obtained after completely covering the diamond surface with the coating. The liquid should be the same batch that is used to coat the fiber or wire if possible, but the minimum requirement is that it must be the same formulation. The final format of the spectrum should be in absorbance. The exposed Primary Coating on the Mylar film is mounted on the center of the diamond with the fiber or wire axis parallel to the direction of the infrared beam. Pressure should be put on the back of the sample to insure good contact with the crystal. The resulting spectrum should not contain any absorbances from the contact cement. If contact cement peaks are observed, a fresh sample should be prepared. It is important to run the spectrum immediately after sample preparation rather than preparing any multiple samples and running spectra when all the sample preparations are complete. The final format of the spectrum should be in absorbance.<br>
[00150]     For both the liquid and the cured coaling, measure the peak area of both the acrylate<br>
double bond peak at 810 cm"  and a reference peak in the 750 - 780 cm"1 region. Peak area is<br>
determined using the baseline technique where a baseline is chosen to be tangent to absorbance<br>
minima on either side of the peak. The area under the peak and above the baseline is then<br>
determined, The integration limits for the liquid and the cured sample are not identical but are<br>
similar, especially for the reference peak.	'[<br>
[00151]     The ratio of the acrylate peak area to the reference peak area is determined for both the liquid and the cured sample. Degree of cure, expressed as percent reacted acrylate unsaturation (% RAU), is calculated from the equation below:<br>
where RL is the area ratio of the liquid sample and Rp is the area ratio of the cured primary.<br>
In-situ Modulus of Primary Coating<br>
[00152]     The in-situ modulus of a Primary Coating on a dual-coated (soft Primary Coating and hard Secondary Coating) glass fiber or a metal wire fiber is measured by this test method. The<br>
 <br>
detailed discussion on this test can be found in Steeman, P.A.M., Slot, J.J.M., Melick, N.G.H.<br>
van, Ven, A.A.F. van de, Cao, H. &amp; Johnson, R. (2003). Mechanical analysis of the in-situ<br>
Primary Coating modulus test for optical fibers may be determined in accordance with the<br>
i procedure set forth in Proceedings 52nd International Wire and Cable Symposium (rWCS,<br>
Philadelphia, USA, November 10-13, 2003), Paper 41.	]<br>
[00153]     For sample preparation, a short length (-2mm) of coating layer is stripped off using a<br>
stripping tool at the location ~ 2cm from a fiber end. The fiber is cut to form the other end with   ■<br>
8mm exactly measured from the stripped coating edge to the fiber end. The portion of the 8mm<br>
coated fiber is then inserted into a meta! sample fixture, as schematically shown in Figure 6 of<br>
the paper [1], The coated fiber is embedded in a micro tube in the fixture; the micro tube<br>
consisted of two half cylindrical grooves; its diameter is made to be about the same as the outer<br>
diameter (~245u.m) of a standard fiber. The fiber is tightly gripped after the screw is tightened;<br>
the gripping force on the Secondary Coating surface is uniform and no significant deformation<br>
occurred in the coating layer. The fixture with the fiber is then mounted on a DMA (Dynamic<br>
Mechanical Analysis) instrument: Rheometrics Solids Analyzer (RSA-D). The metal fixture is<br>
clamped by the bottom grip. The top grip is tightened, pressing on the top portion of the coated<br>
fiber to the extent that it crushed the coating layer. The fixture and the fiber must be vertically<br>
straight. The non-embedded portion of the fiber should be controlled to a constant length for<br>
each sample; 6mm in our tests. Adjust the strain-offset to set the axial pretension to near zero (-<br>
[00154]     Shear sandwich geometry setting is selected to measure the shear modulus G of the<br>
Primary Coating. The sample width, W, of the shear sandwich test is entered to be 0.24mm<br>
calculated according to the following equation:	f<br>
Ln(Rp/Rf)<br>
wherein Rr and Rp are bare fiber and Primary Coating outer radius respectively. The geometry of a standard fiber, Rf ■= 62.5p.rn and Rp=92.5pm, is used for the calculation. The sample length of 8mm (embedded length) and thickness of 0.03mm (Primary Coating thickriess) are entered in the shear sandwich  geometry. The tests are conducted at room temperature (~23°C). The test<br>
51<br>
 <br>
frequency used is 1.0 radian/second. The shear strain e is set to be 0.05. A dynamic time sweep is run to obtain 4 data points for measured shear shear storage modulus G.The reported G is the<br>
average of all data points.	!<br>
ji<br>
[00155]     This measured shear modulus G is then corrected according to the correction method<br>
described in the paper [1]. The correction is to include the glass stretching into consideration in<br>
the embedded and the non-embedded pans. In the correction procedures, tensile modulus of the<br>
bare fiber (Ef) needs to be entered. For glass fibers, Ef=70GPa. For the wire fibers where<br>
stainless steel S314 wires are used, Ef=120GPa. The corrected G value is further adjusted by<br>
using the actual Rf and Rp values. For glass fibers, fiber geometry including Rf and Rp values is<br>
measured by PK2400 Fiber Geometry System. For wire fibers, Rf is 65u.m for the 130pm<br>
diameter stainless steel S314 wires used; Rp is measured under microscope. Finally, the in-situ<br>
i modulus E (tensile shear storage modulus) for Primary Coating on fiber is calculated according<br>
to E = 3G. The reported E is the average of three test samples.<br>
In-situ DMA for T£ measurements of primary and Secondary Coatings on an optical fiber [0125]       The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of primary and Secondary Coatings on a dual-coated glass fiber or a metal wire fiber are measured by this method. These glass transition temperatures are referred to as "Tube Tg".<br>
[0126]        For sample preparation, strip ~ 2cm length of the coating layers off the fiber as a<br>
complete coating tube from one end of the coated fiber by first dipping the coated fiber end<br>
along with the stripping tool in liquid N2 for at least 10 seconds and then strip the coating tube<br>
off with a fast motion while the coating layers are still rigid.	[0127]       A DMA (Dynamic Mechanical Analysis) instrument: Rheometrics Solids Analyzer (RSA-II) is used. For RSA-II, the gap between the two grips of RSAII can be expanded as much as 1mm. The gap is first adjusted to the minimum level by adjusting strain offset. A simple sample holder made by a metal plate folded and lightened at the open end by a screw is used to tightly hold the coating tube sample from the lower end. Slide the fixture into the center of the lower grip and tighten the grip. Using tweezers to straighten the coating tube to upright position through the upper grip. Close and tighten the upper grip. Close the oven and set the oven temperature to a value higher than theTg for Secondary Coating or 100°C with liquid nitrogen<br>
 <br>
as temperature control medium. When the oven temperature reached that temperature, the strain<br>
offset is adjusted until the pretension is in the range of Og to 0.3g<br>
[0128]       Under the dynamic temperature step test of DMA, the test frequency is set at 1.0<br>
radian/second; the strain is 5E-3; the temperature increment is 2°C and the soak time is 10<br>
seconds.	",<br>
[0129]       The geometry type is selected as cylindrical. The geometry setting is the same as the<br>
one used for secondary in-situ modulus test. The sample length is the length of the coating tube<br>
between the upper edge of the metal fixture and the lower grip, 11mm in our test. The diameter<br>
(D) is entered to be 0.16mm according to the following equation:	'=<br>
	.	'i<br>
D = 2x^Rs2-Rp2       ■<br>
where Rs and Rp are secondary and Primary Coating outer radius respectively. The geometry of a standard fiber, Rs= I22.5u.rn and Rp=92.5u.m, is used for the calculation.. [0130]       A dynamic temperature step test is run from the starting temperature (100°C in our test) till the temperature below the Primary Coating Tg or -80°C. After the run, the peaks from tan 6 curve are reported as Primary Coating Tg (corresponding to the lower temperature) and Secondary Coating Tg (corresponding to the higher temperature). Note that the measured glass transition temperatures, especially for primary glass transition temperature, should be considered as relative values of glass transition temperatures for the coating layers on fiber due to the tan 8 shift from the complex structure of the coating tube.<br>
Draw Tower Simulator Examples<br>
Various compositions of the instant claimed Primary Coating and a commercially<br>
available radiation curable Secondary Coating are applied to wire using a Draw Tower Simulator. The wire is run at five different line speeds, 750 meters/minute/llOO meters/minute, 1500 meters/minute, 1800 meters/minute and 2100 meters/minute.<br>
. Drawing is carried out using either wet on dry or wet on wet mode.  Wet on dry mode means the liquid Primary Coating is applied wet, and then the liquid Primary Coating is cured to<br>
 <br>
a solid layer on the wire. After the Primary Coating is cured, the Secondary Coaling is applied<br>
and then cured as well. Wet on wet mode means the liquid Primary Coating is applied wet, then<br>
the Secondary Coating is applied wet and then both the Primary Coating and Secondary Coatings<br>
are cured.	■<br>
The properties of the Primary Coating and Secondary Coating are measured and reported for the following tests:  % RAU, initial and at one month aging at 85°C/85%RH at uncontrolled light. After the Primary Coating has been cured, then the Secondary Coating is applied.<br>
Multiple runs are conducted with different compositions of the Primary.Coating P, Primary Coating CA, Primary Coating CR , Primary Coating BJ and Primary Coating H and a commercially available radiation curable Secondary Coating.<br>
The cured Primary Coating on the wire is tested for initial %RAU, initial in-situ modulus<br>
and initial Tube Tg. The coated wire is then aged for one month at 85"C and 85% relative<br>
humidity. The cured Primary Coating on the wire is then aged for one month and tested for<br>
%RAU, in-situ modulus and aged Tube Tg.

-(2) 600 W/in2 D Fusion UV lamps are used at 100% for the 1° coatings.<br>
-(3) 600 W/in2 D Fusion UV lamps are used at 100% for the 2° coatings. -Temperatures for the two coatings are 30°C. The dies are also set to 30°C. -Carbon dioxide level is 7 liters/min at each die.<br>
 <br>
-Nitrogen level is 20 liters/min at each lamp.<br>
-Pressure for the I ° coating is 1 bar at 25 m/min and goes up to 3 bar at 1000 m/min.<br>
ij<br>
-Pressure for the 2° coating is 1 bar at 25 m/min and goes up to 4 bar at 1000 m/min.<br>
