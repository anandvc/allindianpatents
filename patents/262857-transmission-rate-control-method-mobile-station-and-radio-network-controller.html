				<td>TRANSMISSION RATE CONTROL METHOD, MOBILE STATION AND RADIO NETWORK CONTROLLER<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission rate control method, mobile station and a radio network controller, which controls a transmission rate of uplink user data.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
In a conventional mobile communication system, in an uplink from a mobile station UE to a radio base station Node B, a radio network controller RNC is configured to determine a transmission rate of a dedicated channel, in consideration of radio resources of the radio base station Node B, an interference volume in an uplink, transmission power of the mobile station UE, transmission processing performance of the mobile station UE, a transmission rate required for an upper application, and the like, and to notify the detemiined transmission rate of the dedicated channel by a message of a layer-3 (Radio Resource Control Layer) to both of the mobile station UE and the radio base station Node B.<br>
Here, the radio network controller RNC is provided at an upper level of the radio base station Node B, and is an apparatus configured to control the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE.<br>
In general, data communications often cause burst traffic compared with voice communications or TV communications. Therefore, it is preferable that a transmission rate of a channel used for the data communications is changed fast.<br>
However, as shown in FIG 11, the radio network controller RNC integrally controls a plurality of radio base stations Node B in general. Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been a problem that it is difficult to oerform fast control for chanaina of the transmission rate of channel for example per<br><br>
approximately 1 through 100 ms), due to processing load, processing delay, or the like.<br>
In addition, in the conventional mobile communication system, there has been also a problem that costs for implementing an apparatus and for operating a network are substantially increased even if the fast control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel can be perfomfied.<br>
Therefore, in the conventional mobile communication system, control for changing of the transmission rate of the channel is generally performed on the order from a few hundred ms to a few seconds.<br>
Accordingly, in the conventional mobile communication system, when burst data transmission is perfomied as shown in FIG. 12(a), the data are transmitted by accepting low-speed, high-delay, and low-transmission efficiency as shown in FIG 12(b), or, as shown in FIGi 12(c), by reserving radio resources for high-speed communications to accept that radio bandwidth resources in an unoccupied state and hardware resources in the radio base station Node B are wasted.<br>
It should be noted that both of the above-described radio bandwidth resources and hardware resources are applied to the vertical radio resources in FIG 12.<br>
Therefore, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which are international standardization organizations of the third generation mobile communication system, have discussed a method for controlling radio resources at high speed in a layer-1 and a media access control (MAC) sub-layer (a iayer-2) between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE, so as to utilize the radio resources effectively. Such discussions or discussed functions will be hereinafter referred to as "Enhanced Uplink (EUL)".<br>
As shown in the non-patent document 1, a conventional mobile communication system using "EUL" is configured to; increase a transmission rate of uplink user data by adding a predetermined value to the transmission rate of uplink user data currently in use, when the mobile station UE has received a Relative rate Control Channel (RGCH) from the radio base station Node B, the RGCH indicating that the transmission rate of uplink user data should be increased (indicating "Up").<br>
However, in the conventional mobile communication system using "EUL", the<br>
transmission rate of uplink user data is decreased at a fixed increase step, even when many uplink user data are transmitted in the uplink, or when the uplink user data type does not require very precipitous increase in the transmission rate, and the like. Therefore, there has been a problem that the transmission rate of the uplink user data is unnecessary increased.<br>
In addition, in the conventional mobile communication system using "EUL", the transmission rate of uplink user data is increased at a fixed increase step, even when the uplink is unoccupied, or when the uplink user data type requires increase in the transmission rate, and the like. Therefore, there has been a problem that the level of increase in the transmission rate is insufficient.<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
(Mobile Communication System According to First Embodiment of the  Present Invention)<br>
A description will be given of a configuration of a mobile communication system according to a first embodiment of the present invention with reference to Figs. 1 to 8.<br>
It should be noted that, as shown in FIG. 11, the mobile communication system according to this embodiment is provided with a plurality of radio base stations Nod B #1 to Node B #5 and a radio network controller RNC.<br>
In addition, in the mobile communication system according to this embodiment,<br><br>
a "High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)" is used in a downlink, and an "Enhanced Uplink (EUL)' is used in an uplink.<br>
It should be noted that in both of the HSDPA and the EUL, retransmission control (N process stop and wait) shall be perfonned by a "Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ)".<br>
Therefore, an Enhanced Dedicated Physical Channel (E-DPCH), configured of an Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel (E-DPDCH) and an Enhanced Dedicated Physical Control Channel (E-DPCCH), and a Dedicated Physical Channel (DPCH), configured of a Dedicated Physical Data Channel (DPDCH: Dedicated Physical Data Channel) and a Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH: Dedicated Physical Control Channel), are used in the uplink.<br>
Here, the E-DPCCH transmits control data for the EUL such as a transmission format number for defining a transmission fonmat (transmission block size, or the like) of the E-DPDCH, HARQ related infomiation (the number of retransmission, or the like), and scheduling related information (transmission power, buffer residence-volume, or the like in the mobile station UE).<br>
In addition, the E-DPDCH is paired with the E-DPCCH, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data for the EUL transmitted through the E-DPCCH.<br>
The DPCCH transmits control data such as a pilot symbol that is used for RAKE combining, SIR measurement, or the like, a Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) for identifying a transmission format of uplink DPDCH, and a transmission power control bit in a downlink.<br>
In addition, the DPDCH is paired with the DPCCH, and transmits user data for the mobile station UE based on the control data transmitted through the DPCCH. However, if user data that should be transmitted does not exist in the mobile station UE, the DPDCH can be configured not to be transmitted.<br>
In addition, in the uplink, a "High Speed Dedicated Physical Control Channel (HS-DPCCH)" and a "Random Access Channel (RACH)", which are needed when the HSPDA is applied, are also used.<br><br>
The HS-DPCCH transmits a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) in a downlink and an acknowledge signal (Ack or Nack) for the HS-DPCCH.<br>

The radio network controller RNC according to the present embodiment is an<br><br>
apparatus located on upper level of the radio base station Node B and configured to control radio communication between the radio base station Node B and the mobile station UE.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the radio network controller RNC according to this embodiment is provided with an exchange interface 51, a Logical Link Control (LLC) layer processing section 52, a MAC layer processing section 53, a media signal processing section 54, a radio base station interface 55, and a call control section 56.<br>
The exchange interface 51 is an interface with an exchange 1. The exchange interface 51 is configured to forward the downlink signals transmitted from the exchange 1 to the LLC layer processing section 52, and to forward the uplink signals transmitted from the LLC layer processing section 52 to the exchange 1.<br>
The LLC layer processing section 52 is configured to perfom an LLC sub-layer processing such as a synthesis processing of a header such as a sequence number or a trailer.<br>
The LLC layer processing section 52 is also configured to transmit the uplink signals to the exchange interface 51 and to transmit the downlink signals to the MAC layer processing section 53, after the LLC sub-layer processing is performed.<br>
The MAC layer processing section 53 is configured to perform a MAC layer processing such as a priority control processing or a header granting processing.<br>
The MAC layer processing section 53 is also configured to transmit the uplink signals to the LLC layer processing section 52 and to transmit the downlink signals to the radio base station interface 55 (or a media signal processing section 54), after the MAC layer processing is performed.<br>
The media signal processing section 54 is configured to perform a media signal processing against voice signals or real time image signals.<br>
The media signal processing section 54 is also configured to transmit the uplink signals to the MAC layer processing section 53 and to transmit the downlink signals to the radio base station interface 55, after the media signal processing is performed.<br>
The radio base station interface 55 is an interface with the radio base station Node B.   The radio base station interface 55 is configured to forward the uplink signals<br><br>
transmitted from the radio base station Node B to the MAC layer processing section 53 (or the media signal processing section 54) and to fonvard the downlink signals transmitted from the MAC layer processing section 53 (or the media signal processing section 54) to the radio base station Node B.<br>
The call control section 56 is configured to perform a radio resource control processing, a channel setup and open processing by the layer-3 signaling, or the like. Here, the radio resource control processing includes a call admission control processing, a handover processing, or the like.<br>
The call control section 56 is configured to notify an increase pattem of a transmission rate of uplink user data to the mobile station UE, when setting, with the mobile station UE, a user data channel connection for transmitting uplink user data.<br>
Further, the call control section 56 may be configured to notify an increase pattem of the transmission rate of the uplink user data to the radio base station Node B, when setting a connection with the radio base station Node B.<br>
With reference to Fig. 9, the operation of the mobile communication system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. Here, in Fig. 9, although the example is given to a case where the mobile station UE originates a call to the radio network controller RNC, the present invention is also applicable to a case where the mobile station receives a call.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, in step S1001, the mobile station UE starts transmission in order to request the communication setup (setting a user data channel connection) by using the E-DPCH to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step SI 002, the radio network controller RNC requests the radio base station Node B to set connection for the E-DPCH. Here, the mobile station UE is located on lower level of the radio base station Node B.<br>
In step S1003, when the radio base station Node B has completed setting of the connection, the radio base station Node B transmits the connection setting response indicating that the connection has set, to the radio network controller RNC.<br>
In step S1004, the radio network controller RNC transmits control channel connection setting request to the mobile station UE. The control channel connection<br><br>
setting request is a request for setting a control channel connection for transmitting or receiving the information such as a user data type, a release number of the mobile station, or a transmittable/receivable transmission rate.<br>
In step SI 005, when the mobile station UE has completed setting of the control channel connection, the mobile station UE transmits the control channel connection setting response to the radio network controller RNC. The control channel connection setting response indicates that the connection setting has been completed.<br>
In step S1006, each parameter relating to the E-DPCH (for example, a transmission wave amplitude ratio in each transmission fomiat) is transferred between the mobile station UE and the radio network controller RNC. Thus, the user data channel connection is set.<br>
In step S1007, a communication between the mobile station UE and the radio network controller RNC is performed by using the user data channel connection (for example, an E-DPDCH) which has set in step S 1006.<br>
Further, in step SI 002. the radio network controller notifies an increase pattern of the transmission rate of the uplink user data (corresponding to the E-RGCH) to the radio base station Node B.<br>
Then, the radio base station Node B allocates reception process resource of the uplink user data on the assumption that the mobile station UE increases the transmission rate of the uplink user data in accordance with the notified increase pattern.<br>
In addition, in transmitting or receiving each parameter in step S1006, the radio network controller RNC notifies the increase pattem of the transmission rate of the uplink user data (corresponding to the E-RGCH) to the mobile station UE.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an example of the increase pattem of the transmission rate of<br>
the uplink user data. For example, the radio network controller RNC notifies the<br>
increase pattem B when many uplink user data are transmitted in the uplink, so as to<br>
reduce fluctuation of interference caused by precipitous increase in the transmission<br>
rate of the uplink user data.	It should be noted that the radio network controller<br>
RNC comprises a plurality of the increase pattem. and may be configured to notify the<br><br>
increase pattern selected based on a predetennined standard. Further, the radio network controller RNC may be configured to calculate the slope of time function of the increase pattern and to notify the calculated inclination of time function.<br>
In addition, in step S1007, when the RGCH indicating "Up" has been received from the radio base station Node B, the mobile station UE increases the transmission rate of the uplink user data in accordance with the increase pattern corresponding to the E- RGCH.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail above with the embodiment, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described in the present application. The present invention can be implemented as altered and modified embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the description of claims. Therefore, the description of the present application is for illustrative purposes and is not intended to limit the present invention in any way.<br>
