				<td>Sn-comprising heavy-duty material composition: Method for the production<br>
of a heavy-duty coating, and use thereof<br>
The invention relates to a Sn-comprising material composition for coating<br>
base metals, methods for the production of a Sn-comprising heavy duty<br>
coating on base metals, and the use of this coating. Heavy-duty metal<br>
coatings are produced as a compound of metal bases. For this purpose,<br>
special heavy-duty metal materials are used, which are applied to the metal<br>
bases (support structures). Often, heavy-duty metal materials are employed<br>
on Sn basis, which have positive slide, running-in, embedding and fail-safe<br>
characteristics. In case the coating is more strongly stressed thermally, or<br>
the static and dynamic stress of the coating is high, as is the case with<br>
bearings more likely to experience collision and impact, additional elements<br>
must be employed. Typical applications are heavily stressed bearings in<br>
compressors, pistons and expansion machines as well as rolling equipment.<br>
In the following, the term ,,metal" refers to an individual metal as well metal<br>
alloys and composites comprising a high percentage of metal. Powder<br>
mixtures as well as compressed powders or composites are understood to be<br>
metal mixtures.<br>
Because the support structures of the heavy-duty coating consist, at least at<br>
its surface, of metal or a metal alloy, a bond between the heavy-duty coating<br>
material and the surface of the support structure must be produced.<br>
Generally, many different methods can be used to produce a bond between<br>
the metal layers: sand casting, centrifugal casting, cast cladding, roll<br>
cladding, galvanic coating, soldering, welding, etc. In doing this, it is<br>
important that the heavy-duty coating material adheres well to the support<br>
material, with as much capacity for withstanding stress as possible. In order<br>
to coat metal support structures, Sn-comprising layers - e.g. Sn- founding<br>
alloys according to DIN ISO 4381, UNI 4515, ASTM B23, e.g. SnSbl2Cu6, or<br>
other Sn-alloys or copper alloys according to DIN IS04382, eg. CuPb20Sn5,<br><br>
or other Cu-alloys, known to expert in the technical field are employed;<br>
alternatively, aluminum based alloys, e.g. AISn20Cul are used.<br>
Until now, narrow boundaries for the metal alloys of heavy-duty coating<br>
material had to be taken into account for the security of the metal bond<br>
between the heavy-duty coating and the metal support structures. In this<br>
way, the Sb-content of all established, lead-free tin casting-alloys were, until<br>
now, restricted to a maximum of 14 wt. % and the Cu-content to a maximum<br>
of 9 wt. %; a fine crystal texture, satisfying homogeneity, and particularly<br>
the required bond (without segregation) could only be achieved in this way.<br>
Through the boundaries preset by the casting process, material development<br>
has previously had strict boundaries imposed on it. A material group is<br>
designated as a tin casting-alloy when it, for example, qualifies to cast<br>
bearings, which comprise a maximum 91 wt. % of Sn and maximum 14% of<br>
Sb and maximum 9% of Cu, as well as optional minimal portions of further<br>
elements such as Cd, Zn, Ni, Ag, Se, Cr, Bi, In for example.<br>
In order to improve crystallization, refining elements such as As or Ag were<br>
added to the tin alloys, wherein As causes an environmental problem and Ag<br>
is relatively expensive. Qualified alloys are, for example:<br>
SnSbl2Cu6Zn0,6Ag0, 1.<br>
Another material for the heavy-duty metal coatings is copper alloys. They<br>
comprise &gt;50% of Cu, up to 20 wt. % of Sn, and up to 27% of Pb and are<br>
characterized through resistance to various media. Because both copper<br>
alloys and Sn- casting alloys comprise many of the same components albeit<br>
with different amounts thereof, a transition zone exists between the two.<br>
Typical representatives for such metals for heavy-duty coatings are<br>
CuPb10Sn10, CuPb20Sn5.<br>
In the end, Sn-comprising aluminum alloys are employed as heavy-duty<br>
coatings. In this way, AISn20, AISn20Cu, AISn6Cu, for example, are used for<br>
the production of bearings.<br><br>
Until now, a pretreatment of the bonding surface of the metal support<br>
structure in order to achieve a good bond between the metal layers was<br>
necessary for adhesion reasons. For example, corrosives or a tinning of the<br>
bonding surface become conditions for compound casting between metal<br>
base bodies like steel, cast steel, gray cast iron, bronze and Sn-comprising<br>
coating materials are required; this leads to involved, cost-intensive and<br>
often also pollutive procedures. For some procedures and material pairings,<br>
additional metallic inter-layers are necessary; this brings additional effort<br>
with it.<br>
Until now, most coatings of this sort are cast. Casting such coating materials<br>
entails high efforts. To do this, an exact temperature control is required and<br>
often a pretreatment of the support material with mostly toxic corrosives like<br>
zinc chloride compounds. This also requires an alloy which can be cast and<br>
which can be applied to the support material without segregations or other<br>
decomposition phenomena. In casting procedures, a defined warming of the<br>
support structure and defined cooling after it has been poured out are also<br>
necessary in order to achieve a good quality of crystal texture, high<br>
homogeneity and bonding through equal temperature profiles in both layers.<br>
After the application of the metal layer comprising tin, a machining process is<br>
necessary in order to give the coating its final form.<br>
According to the state of the art, this meant the provision of casting<br>
equipment and the according monitoring and post-processing equipment. In<br>
the case of complex support structures with strongly varying material<br>
thickness, it is, in practice, often difficult to accomplish an even and satisfying<br>
heavy-duty metal layer casting. Also in the case of other methods named<br>
above, the adherence to various parameters are required for a positive<br>
bonding and used to depend strongly on the individual processing<br>
requirements- the method was difficult to standardize.<br><br>
Another method for applying a particularly thin heavy-duty metal layer was a<br>
galvanic coating for the production of multi-layer compound materials.<br>
The thin coating can also be produced through roll cladding on the bases of<br>
Sn-, AI-, Cu-alloys with a high resistance and a thickness of mostly under one<br>
millimeter.<br>
The stress capacity of the coating rises for thin heavy-duty metal coatings—<br>
the pressure resistance as well as the load bearing capacity of the coating.<br>
In contrast to all other materials mentioned, the Sn-casting alloys possess<br>
good fail-safe characteristics when in contact with a slide partner and display<br>
particularly tolerant properties in the event of damage, wherein the slide<br>
partner is not damaged. Sn-casting alloys are relatively soft and can embed<br>
impurities. Until now, they could not be designated as heavy-duty because of<br>
the required larger layer thicknesses (casting procedures). Copper alloys,<br>
which are also employed, are relatively hard and because of this, lead to<br>
significant damages to the slide partner in the case of breakdowns<br>
For this reason, the problem of the invention is to create a simplified method<br>
for the production of Sn-comprising heavy-duty metal-coatings.<br>
According to the invention, the problem is solved through a Sn-comprising<br>
heavy-duty material composition for the coating of metal bases comprising:<br>
0.6 - 91 wt. % of Sn; 75 - 94 wt. % of Al; 0.7 -8 2 wt. % of Cu; 0 - 27 wt. %<br>
of Pb; 6 - 30 wt. % of Sb; 0 - 2 wt. % of Zn; 0 - 1 wt. % of Ni; 0 - 1 wt. %<br>
of As; 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag; 0 - 1.2 wt. % of Cd; 0 - 0.1 wt. % of Se; 0 - 0.2<br>
wt. % of Cr; 0 - 2 wt. % of Bi; 0 - 5 wt. % of In; optional hard materials,<br>
solid lubricants, auxiliary welding agents.<br>
Surprisingly, it is now possible, that because of the new processing methods<br>
according to the invention, these materials, which could not be used in<br>
conventional casting procedures, can be employed for heavy-duty coatings<br><br>
on metal bases. Because until now, the method required extremely restricted<br>
properties of alloys as capable of being cast, compositions which did not<br>
satisfy any of the casting characteristics could not be used for heavy-duty<br>
coatings; this led to the widespread belief that they could not be used at all.<br>
Further, the invention also relates to methods for producing a heavy-duty<br>
coating with a composition of 0.6 - 91 wt. % of Sn; 75 - 94 wt. % of Al; 0.7 -<br>
82 wt. % of Cu; 0 - 27 wt. % of Pb; 6 - 30 wt. % of Sb; 0 - 2 wt. % of Zn; 0<br>
- 1 wt. % of Ni; 0 - 1 wt. % of As; 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag; 0 - 1.2 wt. % of Cd;<br>
0-0.1 wt. % of Se; 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Cr; 0 - 2 wt. % of Bi; 0 - 5 wt. % of In;<br>
optional hard materials, solid lubricants, auxiliary welding agents and<br>
auxiliary processing agents such as free-flowing agents and pressing agents.<br>
According to the inventive method, an starting material of said composition is<br>
provided, the starting material is introduced into the laser welding station,<br>
one or several metal layers are laser-welded onto a base metal by means of<br>
the laser welding station, and the obtained heavy-duty coating is optionally<br>
finished. The invention finally relates to the use of said coating as a heavy-<br>
duty coating on base metals, bearings.<br>
Through the laser welding process/method, it is now possible to also apply<br>
poor quality or not capable of being cast material compositions such as alloys<br>
or compounds — with solid lubricants such as MoS2 or graphite composites,<br>
etc. — to metal bases. Because no casting requirements must be taken into<br>
account, these can be processed even without the costly warming of the<br>
support structures and the subsequent cooling.<br>
A useful material composition is a a Sn-rich heavy-duty material composition<br>
wherein the composition contains 40 - 91% of Sn; 3-30 wt. % of Cu; 6-30<br>
wt. % of Sb.<br>
An advantageous Sn-rich heavy-duty material composition contains 61 - 83%<br>
of Sn; 3 - 9% of Cu; &gt;14 - 30% of Sb; 0.1 - 1% Zn.<br><br>
A further advantageous alloy sub-group of the heavy-duty material<br>
compositions contains 56-85 wt. % of Sn; &gt;9 - 30 wt. % of CU; 6-14 % of<br>
Sb; 0.1-1 wt. % of Zn. Alternatively, another Sn-rich heavy-duty material<br>
composition can be employed comprising 40 - 77 wt. 5 of Sn; &gt;9 - 30 wt. %<br>
of Cu; &gt; 14 - 30 wt. % of Sb; 0.1-1 wt. % of Zn.<br>
Typical suitable Sn-rich heavy-duty material compositions can be, but are not<br>
restricted to: SnSb7Cu7Zn0.8; SnSb7Cul2Zn0.8; SnSb7Cul8Zn0.8;<br>
SnSbl2Cu6Zn0.8; SnSbl2Cul2Zn0.8; SnSbl2Cul8Zn0.8.<br>
A further sub-group of the Sn-compositions are Cu-rich; these recommend<br>
themselves with a content of: 0.6 - 20 wt. % of Sn; 50 - 83 wt. % of Cu; 0 -<br>
27 wt. % of Pb.<br>
Typical Cu-rich Sn-compositions have a content of 0.6 - 11 wt. % Sn; 78 - 82<br>
wt. % of Cu; 9-27 wt/% of Pb. Typical Cu-rich Sn-compositions are:<br>
SnSb8Cu4; CuPb10Sn10, CuPb17Sn5; CuPb25Sn4, CuPb24Snl, on which the<br>
Cu-rich Sn-material compositions according to the invention are not in any<br>
way restricted to.<br>
Sn-comprising Al-rich material compositions have a percentage of 5 - 23 wt.<br>
% of Sn; 75 - 94 wt. % Al, 0.7 - 2 wt. % of Cu; 0.1 - 1.5 wt. % of Ni. Typical<br>
representatives, on which the the Al-rich Sn-comprising material<br>
compositions according to the invention are in no way restricted to, include<br>
AISn20Cu, AISn6Cu.<br>
It is advantageous if the heavy-duty material composition is available in the<br>
form of a powder, also a compressed powder, such as a powder pellet or a<br>
friction-welded powder pellet.<br>
The laser welding station is preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
the powder and wire laser welding stations, for the reason that these<br>
procedures make an even application of the material possible.<br><br>
When powder-based starting materials are employed, costly wire drawing can<br>
be avoided. In using powder, the necessity to produce one or more wires is<br>
not immediate and materials which are hardly, or not at all ductile, such as<br>
for composites, can be processed. In this way, the processing is simplified,<br>
particularly because powder can be added more constantly. However, the<br>
wire is easy to handle and can, in some cases, be easier to store and to have<br>
on hand. The powder can consist of a mixture or an alloy.<br>
The wire can consist of a unitary material, but can also consist of various<br>
components— for example, it can comprise a core made from another<br>
material. The wire can be drawn in the usual way, but also through a powder<br>
shaping process, such as the conform process or powder forging; optionally it<br>
can be produced with pressing agents or adhesion agents.<br>
In many cases, as is obvious to the expert in the technical field, laser welding<br>
takes place in a protective gas atmosphere in order to avoid unwanted<br>
oxidation or reactions with other air components such as dampness, nitrogen<br>
or CO2. It can be preferable that a composite is formed from the starting<br>
material.<br>
A typical layer thickness of the applied layers of the Sn-comprising material<br>
compositions is 0.05 to 3 mm.<br>
Through the laser welding technology used according to the invention, it is<br>
possible to apply thinner heavy-duty metal coatings on Sn-bases of good<br>
quality with new compositions on metal support structures, wherein<br>
advantageously and surprisingly any pretreatment of the bonding surface can<br>
be avoided. As a result, the pretreatment which was necessary for casting<br>
and which used ecologically questionable corrosives or tinning can be<br>
avoided. The costly casting process with restricted non-uniform quality can<br>
simply be replaced by laser welding. In addition, the preheating/cooling of<br>
the materials, which was previously necessary in the casting process, can<br><br>
also be avoided. This process was only necessary to achieve a good crystal<br>
texture with good homogeneity and adhesion. Further, the result is no longer<br>
influenced by the form of the coated body and the process can be undertaken<br>
normally according to repeatable parameters. Even a repair of heavy-duty<br>
coating or a new coating of metal supports on location is possible through the<br>
use of mobile laser welding tools, wherein the result is only influenced by the<br>
welding parameters.<br>
In using the laser welding method, thin or thick layers as needed, which are<br>
both homogeneous and finely crystalline, are achieved; in this way a very<br>
quick economic coating of high quality is achieved.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been established that the material boundaries of the<br>
casting process, which requires alloys capable of being melted, no longer<br>
apply in the case of laser welding. Now alloys and composites can be laser<br>
welded, which could not be used in the casting process because of<br>
decomposition phenomena and crystallization problems; refinement agents<br>
are also no longer necessary because refinement takes place through the<br>
application. For example, the amounts of Sb and Cu in the Sn- casting alloys<br>
are not subject to any restriction necessitated by the procedure and crystal<br>
refining elements such as As and Ag are no longer absolutely necessary.<br>
In this way, Sn-comprising lead-free metal coating can essentially consist of<br>
the basic elements Sn, Sb, Cu<br>
a)	with up to 14 wt. % Sb and up to 9 wt. % Cu,<br>
optionally with further elements such as, for example: from 0 to 1 wt.<br>
% of Ni, from 0 to 1 wt. % of As, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag, from 0 -<br>
1.2 wt. % of Cd, from 0 - 0.1 wt. % of Se, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Cr,<br>
from 0 - 2 wt. % of Bi, from 0 - 5 wt. % of In, preferably with 0.1-1<br>
wt. % of Zn or, however, also with<br>
b)	with&gt;14 wt. % of Sb and up to 9 wt. % of Cu<br>
optionally with further elements such as, for example: from 0 to 1 wt.<br>
% of Ni, from 0 to 1 wt. % of As, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag, from 0 -<br><br>
1.2 wt. % of Cd, from 0-0.1 wt. % of Se, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Cr,<br>
from 0 - 2 wt. % of Bi, from 0 - 5 wt. % of In, preferably with 0.1-1<br>
wt. % of Zn<br>
c)	with up to 14 wt. % of Sb and &gt;9 wt. % of Cu,<br>
optionally with further elements such as, for example: from 0 to 1 wt.<br>
% of Ni, from 0 to 1 wt. % of As, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag, from 0 -<br>
1.2 wt. % of Cd, from 0-0.1 wt. % of Se, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Cr,<br>
from 0 -2 wt. % of Bi, from 0 - 5 wt. % of In, preferably with 0.1-1<br>
wt. % of Zn<br>
d)	with &gt; 14 wt. % of Sb and &gt;9 wt. % of Cu<br>
optionally, with further elements such as, for example: from 0 to 1 wt.<br>
% of Ni, from 0 to 1 wt. % of As, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Ag, from 0 -<br>
1.2 wt. % of Cd, from 0 - 0.1 wt. % of Se, from 0 - 0.2 wt. % of Cr,<br>
from 0 - 2 wt. % of Bi, from 0 - 5 wt. % of In, preferably with 0.1-1<br>
wt. % of Zn.<br>
These are produced and used as coatings.<br>
However, Sn-comprising metal coatings with a Cu-base and an Sn-content of<br>
up to 20 wt. % or Sn-comprising metal coatings with an Al-base and Sn-<br>
content of up to 23 wt. % can also be advantageous and more simply<br>
applied, mostly with a marked improvement in quality. All these alloys can<br>
optionally comprise further alloy elements in small amounts; optionally, they<br>
can comprise composites, solid lubricants, and auxiliary welding agents.<br>
Through this expansion of the coating material spectrum, a clear<br>
improvement of the technological characteristics of the coating is possible<br>
and an, until now, unacknowledged improvement in the Sn-comprising<br>
heavy-duty coatings can be realized.<br>
Previous risks for material inhomogeneity occurring during casting no longer<br>
apply.<br><br>
According to the patents DE 44 40 477 or EP 0717121, an improvement in<br>
the technological data can be achieved for white metals through the<br>
additional element Zn. This improvement refers not only to the pressure<br>
resistance, but also to the creep strength. This means that Sn-comprising<br>
materials with a Zn-supplement possess a particularly high geometric form<br>
stability under extreme stress and, for this reason, comprise a high long-term<br>
stress capacity- similar to the stress/strain - diagram of steel- the material<br>
creeps less and therefore also has fewer plastic crack-free deformation in the<br>
case of higher temperatures and pressure. As a result, its life span is<br>
lengthened; the running surface, for example, can be decreased and<br>
improved lifetimes and stress capacity, such as those characterizing materials<br>
without Zn, can be attained. Additionally, when there are the same technical<br>
properties, the installation space for each bearing can be markedly reduced.<br>
Because practically every variation of the material composition can be<br>
produced and processed as a powder, all materials with Sn, Al and Cu basis<br>
can be used as long as they are all qualified as heavy-duty coatings. In this<br>
way, composites that have markedly improved characteristics to the known<br>
Sn-comprising coatings can also be laser welded. In the case of powder, this<br>
can only consist of one material, the alloy, but also of various components<br>
which result in a desired final composition.<br>
Through supplementing with zn, the coating characteristics of the Sn-<br>
comprising materials is further improved; long life spans can be achieved in<br>
this way. The stress/strain diagram of the alloy changes itself and becomes<br>
more steel-like; the material creeps less (plastic, crack-free deformation<br>
caused by temperature and pressure). The less a material creeps, the longer<br>
the life span of the corresponding heavy-duty coating.<br>
With the casting process, the heavy-duty coatings which were lead free on<br>
the basis of Sn, for example, could only employ up to 14 % of Sb and up to 9<br>
% of Cu, preferably 12 % of Sb, 6 % of Cu - the more Sb and Cu, the more<br>
load capacity. Through the new process, material compositions in the Sn/Cu-<br><br>
system, which comprise considerably better characteristics, can be processed<br>
simply, whereas through the previous method, they could not be processed.<br>
As a result of composites now being able to be processed, it is now possible<br>
to incorporate solid lubricants into the bearing metal layer and to improve its<br>
characteristics in this way additionally.<br>
In this way, a smooth transition between the Sn-casting alloys and copper<br>
alloys can be produced with mixing ratios, wherein these materials are<br>
exceptionally advantageous in various uses.<br>
In the following, the invention is further detailed with the aid of<br>
advantageous examples which the invention in no way restricts itself to.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Application of a coating through laser welding with a wire feed.<br>
A laser welding machine a was operated with wire feed from SnSb8Cu4 under<br>
protective gas. With this material, a steel support was coated. It formed a<br>
smooth, adhering layer of a thickness of 3 mm out of many welded layers<br>
that was machined thereafter. Higher-quality axial bearing segments for a<br>
turbine could be produced more quickly and with less effort than through the<br>
usual casting process.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Application of a coating through laser welding with a powder feed.<br>
A laser welding machine with a powder composition of<br>
SnSb12Cu6Zn0,6Ag0,1 was operated with protective gas. With this material,<br>
a steel support material was coated through laser welding. It formed a<br>
smooth, adhering layer of 1 mm. A higher-quality bearing layer could be<br>
produced more quickly and with less effort than through the usual casting<br><br>
process. As a result of avoiding the step of the wire feed, it is possible to use<br>
less ductile materials which are not easily drawn on a wire, as starting<br>
materials.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Application of a coating through laser welding with a powder feed.<br>
On the coating shown detailed in example 2, a further layer with a thickness<br>
of 3 mm was applied with changed welding parameters through one<br>
operational step. A higher-quality thicker layer could also be produced more<br>
quickly and with less effort than through the usual casting process. As a<br>
result that the step of producing the wire was avoided, it is possible to add<br>
greater material amounts continually at the same speed.<br>
Even though the invention was described with the aid of advantageous<br>
embodiment examples, it is apparent to the expert in the technical field that<br>
various alternative embodiments exist so that the scope of protection of the<br>
invention is bounded through the claims and not through the specific<br>
description.<br><br>
