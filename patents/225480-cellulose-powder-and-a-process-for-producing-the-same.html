				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CELLULOSE POWDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to cellulose<br>
powder suitable as an excipient for compression, molding<br>
in medicir.al, food and industrial applications. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
cellulose suitable as an excipient for compression<br>
molding that has excellent fluidity and disintegrating<br>
properties while retaining good compression mold-<br>
ability, when, used in medicinal applications; and to an<br>
excipient comprising the cellulose.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Tablettir.g of a drug has advantages such as<br>
high productivity and easy handling of the resulting<br>
tablets during their transportation or upon their use.<br>
Therefore, an excipient for compression melding needs<br>
to have sufficient molaability to inapart such hardness<br>
that the tablets are not worn away or destroyed during<br>
their transportation or upon their use. Tablets used<br>
as medicine are required to be uniform in drug centert<br>
per tablet in order tc accurately exhibit their<br>
efficacy. Therefore, when mixed powder of a drug and<br>
an excipient for compression molding is compressed into<br>
the tablets, a uniform amount of the powder should be<br><br>
packed into the die of a tabletting machine. Accord-<br>
ingly, the excipient for compression molding needs to<br>
have not only moldability but also sufficient fluidity.<br>
Moreover, the tablets as medicine should have not only<br>
the properties described above but also a short<br>
disintegration time to rapidly exhibit their efficacy<br>
after taking. With an increase of the rate of disinte-<br>
gration, the medicine is dissolved more rapidly in<br>
digestive fluid, so that the transfer of the medicine<br>
into blood is more rapid, resulting in easy absorption<br>
of the medicine. Therefore, the excipient for compres-<br>
sion molding should have rapid disintegrating property<br>
in addition to moldability and fluidity.<br>
Many active ingredient materials cannot be<br>
molded by compression and hence are tabletted by blend-<br>
ing with an excipient for compression molding. In<br>
general, the larger the amount of the excipient for<br>
compression molding blended into the tablets, the<br>
higher the hardness of the resulting tablets. The<br>
higher the compression stress, the higher the strength<br>
of the resulting tablets. Crystalline cellulose is<br>
often used as an excipient for compression molding from<br>
the viewpoint of safety and the above-mentioned<br>
properties.<br>
When an active ingredient and the like which,<br>
are poor in moldability are tabletted in the field of<br>
medicine, an excessive compression stress is<br>
unavoidably applied attain a practical tablet hardness.<br><br>
The excessive compression stress on a tabletting<br>
machine accelerates the abrasion of dies and punches,<br>
and the disintegration time of the resulting tablets is<br>
increased. For example, where an amount of an active<br>
ingredient, such as a drug, to be blended is large<br>
(i.e. where the starting powder has a large specific<br>
volume) such as a Chinese orthodox medicine, is<br>
blended, or where tablets are miniturized so that the<br>
tablets are taken more easily, the problems, such as<br>
abrasion or destruction of the tablets during their<br>
transportation, are caused since the amount of an<br>
excipient blended is so remarkably limited, that<br>
desirable tablet hardness cannot be attained. More-<br>
over, there is, for example, the problem that when the<br>
active ingredient to be used is that sensitive to<br>
striking pressure, such as an enzyme, antibiotic or the<br>
like, the active ingredient is inactivated by heat<br>
generation by striking pressure or striking pressure<br>
per se, it cannot be formulated into tablets because<br>
its content is decreased in an attempt to attain a<br>
practical hardness. In order to solve such problems,<br>
an excipient for compression molding is desired which<br>
has sufficient fluidity and disintegrating property and<br>
has a moldability higher than before, which can impart<br>
a sufficient tablet hardness even when added in a small<br>
amount, or impart a sufficient tablet hardness even at<br>
a low striking pressure.<br>
For cellulose powder used as an excipient for<br><br>
medicine, compression moldability, disintegrating<br>
property and fluidity are desired to be satisfactorily<br>
high at the same time. However, since compression<br>
moldability and the other properties, i.e.,<br>
disintegrating property and fluidity are contrary to<br>
each other, no previous cellulose powder that has a<br>
high moldability has exhibited excellent disintegrating<br>
property and fluidity.<br>
Cellulose powder, crystalline cellulose and<br>
powdered cellulose have been known and used in<br>
medicinal, food and industrial applications.<br>
JP-B-40-26274 discloses crystalline cellulose<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 15 to 375,<br>
an apparent specific volume of 1.84 to 8.92 cmVg and a<br>
particle size of 300 nm or less. JP-B-56-2047<br>
discloses crystalline cellulose having an average<br>
polymerization degree of 60 to 375, an apparent<br>
specific volume of 1.6 to 3.1 cmVg, a specific volume<br>
of 1.40 cmVg or more, a content of powder of 200-mesh<br>
size or more of 2 - 80 wt% and an angle of repose of 35<br>
- 42°. DE2921496 discloses that cellulose powder<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 150 is<br>
produced by carrying out acid hydrolysis of a cellulose<br>
material in the form of flowable, non-fibrous and<br>
water-insoluble cellulose powder to adjust the solid<br>
content to 30 - 40 wt%, followed by drying on trays at<br>
140 - 150°C. RU2050362 discloses a process in which in<br>
order to produce a stable gel of powdered cellulose,<br><br>
powdered cellulose having an average polymerization<br>
degree of 400 or less is obtained by impregnating a<br>
starting material containing cellulose with a mineral<br>
acid or an acid salt solution, and then hydrolyzing the<br>
starting material at a high temperature while stirring<br>
a starting material layer at a shear rate of 10 -<br>
1,000 s"1 for 1-10 minutes. The crystalline<br>
celluloses and powdered celluloses concretely disclosed<br>
in these references, however, are disadvantageous in<br>
that the average L/D value of particles of 75 |im or<br>
less after drying, the apparent specific volume and the<br>
apparent tapping specific volume are so small that the<br>
compression moldability is low.<br>
JP-A-63-267731 discloses cellulose powder<br>
having a certain average particle size (30 (xm or less)<br>
and a specific surface area of 1.3 m2/g or more. This<br>
cellulose powder involves the following problems<br>
because it is produced through a grinding step: its<br>
moldability is insufficient because the average L/D<br>
value of particles of 75 fim or less is small; its<br>
fluidity is low because its particles are small and<br>
light; and its disintegrating property is very low<br>
because its apparent tapping specific volume is too<br>
low.<br>
JP-A-1-272643 discloses cellulose powder<br>
having a specified crystal form (cellulose I type), a<br>
porosity for pores with a diameter of 0.1 pm or more of<br>
20% or more, and a content of powder of 350-mesh size<br>
or more of 90% or more. JP-A-2-84401 discloses<br>
cellulose powder having a crystal form of type I, a<br>
specific surface area of 20 m2/g or more, a total volume<br>
of pores with a diameter of 0.01 mm or more of 0.3 cm3/g<br>
or more, and an average particle size of at most 100<br>
mm. Although they have a relatively high moldability,<br>
these cellulose powders, however, are different from<br>
the cellulose powder of the present invention as the<br>
L/D value of dried powder is less than 2.0. In<br>
addition, the cellulose powders are not desirable<br>
because the nitrogen specific surface area of their<br>
particles is too large, so that their conduits are<br>
decreased during compression, resulting in low<br>
disintegrating property. Moreover, the cellulose<br>
powders disclosed in the above references are obtained<br>
by hydrolysis followed by spray drying using an organic<br>
solvent as a medium for a slurry before drying. These<br>
powders have not been put to practical use because the<br>
use of the organic solvent requires, for example, a<br>
dryer having an explosion-proof structure and a system<br>
for recovering the organic solvent and hence entails<br>
high cost.<br>
JP-A-6-316535 discloses crystalline cellulose<br>
obtained by acid hydrolysis or alkali oxidative<br>
decomposition of a cellulosic material, which has an<br>
average polymerization degree of 100 - 375, an acetic<br>
acid retention of 280% or more, compression character-<br>
istics represented by Kawakita's equation wherein the<br><br>
constants a and b are 0.85 - 0.90 and 0.05 - 0.10,<br>
respectively, an apparent specific volume of 4.0 - 6.0<br>
cmVg, a specific volume of 2.4 cm3/g or more, a<br>
specific surface area of less than 20 m2/g, substantially<br>
no particles of 355 mm. or more, and an average<br>
particle size of 30 - 120 mm. The crystalline<br>
cellulose powder disclosed in the above reference is<br>
described as having an excellent balance between<br>
moldability and disintegrating property. The angle of<br>
repose of the concretely disclosed crystalline<br>
cellulose powder of an example having the best balance<br>
between moldability and disintegrating property is<br>
measured and found to be more than 55°. The fluidity<br>
of this crystalline cellulose powder is thus not<br>
satisfactory. Particularly when molded under a high<br>
striking pressure, the crystalline cellulose disclosed<br>
in the above reference can be given a high hardness but<br>
has the following problems: the water vapor specific<br>
surface area of particles after drying is so small that<br>
the conduits in the resulting tablets is decreased to<br>
retard the disintegration of the tablets; and in the<br>
case of, for example, a recipe in which the proportion<br>
of an active ingredient having a low fluidity is high,<br>
the coefficient of variation of the weight of the<br>
resulting tablets is increased because of the low<br>
fluidity to affect the uniformity of the content of a<br>
drug.<br>
In addition, JP-A-11-152233 discloses<br>
crystalline cellulose having an average polymerization<br>
degree of 100 - 375, a content of particles capable of<br>
passing through a 75-mm screen and remaining on a 38-mm<br>
screen of 70% or more based on the total weight of the<br>
crystalline cellulose, and an average L/D (the ratio of<br>
the major axis to the minor axis) value of particles of<br>
2.0 or more. This reference, however, does not<br>
describe the angle of repose of the crystalline<br>
cellulose disclosed therein. The crystalline cellulose<br>
specifically disclosed which is obtained by sieving the<br>
crystalline cellulose disclosed in JP-A-6-316535 has<br>
problems of worse fluidity and disintegrating property<br>
than the crystalline cellulose of JP-A-6-316535 itself.<br>
JP-A-50-19917 discloses a process for producing an<br>
additive for molding tablets which comprises<br>
depolymerizing purified pulp to an average polymeriza-<br>
tion degree of 450 - 650 by pretreatment, and subject-<br>
ing the depolymerization product to mechanical grinding<br>
treatment until the apparent tapping specific volume<br>
becomes 1.67 - 2.50 cmVg and the particle size becomes<br>
such a value that 50% or more of the particles pass<br>
through a 200-mesh screen. The cellulose powder<br>
disclosed in this reference is disadvantageous in that<br>
its polymerization degree is so high it exhibits<br>
fibrousness, the average L/D value of its particles of<br>
75 mm or less and its apparent specific volume are too<br>
large, so that it is poor in disintegrating property<br>
and fluidity. The fact that the apparent tapping<br><br>
specific volume of this cellulose powder is small for<br>
its apparent specific volume is also a cause for the<br>
deterioration of the disintegrating property of tablets<br>
obtained by compression.<br>
As described above, no cellulose powder<br>
having moldability, fluidity and disintegrating<br>
property at the same time with a good balance among<br>
them has been known as conventional cellulose powder.<br>
Medicine often has a form of a granular<br>
preparation such as granules or fine granules, to which<br>
a coating is applied to improve the stability of an<br>
active ingredient, adjust the release rate of a drug,<br>
mask a taste, or impart enteric properties; or a form<br>
of a matrix type granular preparation obtained by<br>
granulating a mixture of a coating agent and a drug<br>
together with other ingredients. When the granular<br>
preparation has a particle size of about 1 mm or less,<br>
it is made into capsules in most cases from the view-<br>
point of ease of handling, but it is preferably made<br>
into tablets by compression molding of a mixture of the<br>
granular preparation and an excipient, from the<br>
viewpoint of cost and ease of taking. However, when<br>
granules having a coating film, such as sustained<br>
release coated granules, bitter-taste-masked granules,<br>
enteric coated granules or the like are tabletted by<br>
compression, there is the following problem: the<br>
coating film is damaged by compression stress and hence<br>
the rate of dissolution and release is increased in<br><br>
mouth, stomach and intestines, so that the exhibition<br>
of an expected drug efficacy is not achieved. In order<br>
to solve this problem, the following methods have been<br>
disclosed. JP-A-53-142520 discloses a method wherein<br>
crystalline cellulose is used. JP-A-61-221115<br>
discloses a method wherein crystalline cellulose is<br>
used in a proportion of approximately 10 - 50% based on<br>
the amount of tablets. JP-A-3-36089 discloses a method<br>
wherein crystalline cellulose having an average<br>
particle size of 30 (jia or less and a specific surface<br>
area of 1.3 m2/g or more is used. JP-A-5-32542 _<br>
discloses a method wherein crystalline cellulose having<br>
a specific surface area of 20 nr/g or more and a porous<br>
structure in which the total volume of pores having a<br>
diameter of 0.01 mm or more is 0.3 cmVg or more. JP-A-<br>
8-10465H—discloses a method wherein a microcrystalline<br>
cellulose having an average polymerization degree of<br>
150 - 220, an apparent specific volume of 4.0 - 6.0<br>
cmVg, an apparent tapping specific volume of 2.4 cmVg<br>
or more, a specific surface area of less than 20 m2/g,<br>
an acetic acid retention of 280% or more, a content of<br>
particles of 355 mm or more of less than 5 wt%, a<br>
particle size distribution with an average particle<br>
size of 30 - 120 mm compression characteristics<br>
represented by Kawakita's equation wherein the<br>
constants a and b are 0.85 - 0.90 and 0.05 - 0.10,<br>
respectively, and such compression molding character-<br>
istics that a cylindrical molded product with a base<br><br>
area of 1 cm2 obtained by compressing 500 mg of the<br>
crystalline cellulose at 10 MPa for 10 seconds has a<br>
fracture strength in the direction of diameter of 10 kg<br>
or more (100 N or more in terms of a fracture strength<br>
in SI system of units) and a disintegration time of 100<br>
seconds or less, is used.<br>
The methods disclosed in JP-A-53-142520 and<br>
JP-A-61-221115, however, are disadvantageous in that<br>
because of the low compression moldability of the<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, high compression stress is<br>
unavoidably applied in order to attain a practical<br>
hardness, so that the damage to the coating film cannot<br>
be sufficiently prevented. The method disclosed in JP-<br>
A-3-36089 is disadvantageous in that the microcrystal-<br>
line cellulose has a low fluidity and hence is apt to<br>
be separated and segregated from granules during the<br>
preparation of tablets. The microcrystalline cellulose<br>
disclosed in JP-A-5-32542 is disadvantageous in that it<br>
is not practical due to high cost which attributes to<br>
the use of an organic solvent for the preparation<br>
thereof. In the case where high compression stress<br>
cannot be applied, for example, the case where the<br>
strength of granules is low, the content of crystalline<br>
cellulose should be increased in order to reduce the<br>
compression stress. In such a case, the crystalline<br>
cellulose disclosed in JPz-A-8-104650 is disadvantageous<br>
in that the use of the crystalline cellulose is<br>
limited, as it makes the disintegration of the result-<br><br>
ing tablets very difficult.<br>
Many active ingredients for medicine are<br>
often used after being made into fine particles, and<br>
have such a low fluidity that they are not easily<br>
compression-molded by a direct compression method (a<br>
direct striking method). In particular, the larger the<br>
amount of the active ingredient for medicine to be<br>
added, the more difficult the compression molding. The<br>
above JP-A-8-104650 describes that the use of the<br>
above-mentioned microcrystalline cellulose, a fluidiz-<br>
ing agent and a disintegrating agent for Chinese<br>
orthodox medicine powder or crude drug powder ensures<br>
enough fluidity to be subjected to a direct tabletting<br>
method, and thus makes it possible to produce tablets<br>
having an excellent balance between moldability and<br>
disintegrating property. However, in the case where<br>
the content of an active ingredient for medicine having<br>
a low moldability, which is not limited to Chinese<br>
orthodox medicine powder or crude drug powder, is<br>
increased in a pharmaceutical composition, there is<br>
still a problem that sufficient fluidity cannot be<br>
attained. Moreover, if the amount of a disintegrating<br>
agent is not sufficient, the retardation of disinte-<br>
gration and a decrease of the rate of dissolution<br>
occur. Since an active ingredient powder for medicine<br>
is poor in compression moldability and cannot give a<br>
molded product without the addition of an excipient, a<br>
granule compression method is generally adopted in<br><br>
which compression moldability, disintegrating property<br>
and fluidity are assured by carrying out a step of<br>
granulating the active ingredient for medicine together<br>
with an excipient by a well-known wet or dry process,<br>
and then the resulting granules are compression-molded.<br>
An extra-granulation method is also often adopted as a<br>
means for enhancing the effect of the addition of an<br>
excipient by adding the excipient outside the granules<br>
besides the excipient added inside the granules upon<br>
producing the granules. JP-B-5-38732 discloses a<br>
crystalline cellulose having an average particle size<br>
of 30 |am or less and a specific surface area of 1.3 m2/g<br>
or more. JP-A-8-104650 discloses a process for<br>
tabletting, using specific crystalline cellulose, by<br>
the granule compression method. These crystalline<br>
celluloses, however, are disadvantageous in that when<br>
compression stress is increased, the disintegration is<br>
retarded and the rate of dissolution is decreased.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is intended to provide<br>
cellulose powder having various properties, i.e.,<br>
moldability, fluidity and disintegrating property, at<br>
the same time with a good balance among them. Further-<br>
more, the present invention is intended to provide the<br>
following tablets by incorporating said cellulose<br>
powder into the tablets: tablets having high hardness<br>
without the retardation of their disintegration,<br><br>
especially when molded under a high striking pressure;<br>

granules, and less damages to the coating films of the<br>
granules and having only a slight change in drug-<br>
releasing property when compression molded; and tablets<br>
which are uniform in their weight even when their drug<br>
content is high, and which have a good balance between<br>
hardness and disintegrating property.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described below in<br>
detail.<br>
The cellulose powder according to the present<br>
invention should have an average polymerization degree<br>
of 150 - 450, preferably 200 - 450, more preferably 230<br>
- 450. When the average polymerization degree is less<br>
than 150, the moldability of the cellulose powder is<br>
undesirably insufficient. When the average polymeriza-<br>
tion degree is more than 450, the cellulose powder<br>
shows remarkable fibrousness, so that its fluidity and<br>
disintegrating property are undesirably deteriorated.<br><br>
When the average polymerization degree is 230 - 450,<br>
the cellulose powder has an especially excellent<br>
balance among moldability, disintegrating property and<br>
fluidity, and thus preferred- The average polymeriza-<br>
tion degree is preferably not a level-off polymeriza-<br>
tion degree. When hydrolysis is carried out to the<br>
level-off polymerization degree, the L/D value of<br>
particles is liable to be low by a stirring operation<br>
in a production process, so that the moldability is<br>
undesirably deteriorated. The term "level-off<br>
polymerization degree" used herein means a polymeriza-<br>
tion degree measured by a viscosity method (a copper<br>
ethylenediamine method) after hydrolysis carried out<br>
under the following conditions: 2.5N hydrochloric acid,<br>
boiling temperature, and 15 minutes. It is known that<br>
when a cellulosic material is hydrolyzed under mild<br>
conditions, its region other than crystals permeable<br>
with an acid, i.e., the so-called noncrystalline region<br>
is selectively depolymerized, so that the cellulosic<br>
material hydrolyzed has a definite average polymeriza-<br>
tion degree called a level-off polymerization degree<br>
(INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY, Vol. 42, No. 3,<br>
p. 502-507 (1950)). After the polymerization degree<br>
reaches the level-off polymerization degree, it does<br>
not become lower than the level-off polymerization<br>
degree even if the hydrolysis time is prolonged.<br>
Therefore, when the polymerization degree is not<br>
lowered by hydrolysis of dried cellulose powder under<br><br>
the following conditions: 2.5N hydrochloric acid,<br>
boiling temperature, and 15 minutes, it can tell that<br>
the polymerization degree has reached the level-off<br>
polymerization degree. When the polymerization degree<br>
is lowered by the hydrolysis, it can tell that the<br>
polymerization degree has not yet reached the level-off<br>
polymerization degree.<br>
The polymerization degree should be higher<br>
than the level-off polymerization degree by preferably<br>
about 5 to about 300, more preferably about 10 to about<br>
250. When the difference is less than 5, it becomes<br>
difficult to control the L/D value of particles to be<br>
within a specific range, so that the moldability is<br>
undesirably deteriorated. When the difference is more<br>
than 300, the fibrousness is increased, to give<br>
inferior disintegrating property and the fluidity,<br>
which is not preferred.<br>
In the cellulose powder according to the<br>
present invention, the content of particles capable of<br>
remaining on a 250-|am screen is preferably 50 wt% or<br>
less. Since particles of more than 250 (jia form a dense<br>
structure when granulated, their presence in a propor-<br>
tion of more than 50 wt% undesirably deteriorates the<br>
moldability and the disintegrating property. The<br>
content is preferably 30 wt% or less, more preferably<br>
10 wt% or less, in particular, 5 wt% or less.<br>
The average particle size of the cellulose<br>
powder of the present invention should be 20 - 250 fam.<br><br>
When the average particle size is less than 20 mm, the<br>
adhesive and cohesive properties of the cellulose<br>
powder are increased, resulting in not only difficult<br>
handling but also a low fluidity. When the average<br>
particle size is more than 250 mm, the cellulose powder<br>
is separated and segregated from an active ingredient,<br>
so that the content uniformity of the resulting<br>
pharmaceutical composition is undesirably apt to be<br>
decreased. The average particle size is preferably 20<br>
- 120 |im.<br>
In the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention, the average L/D value of particles of 75 mm<br>
or less should be 2.0 - 4.5, preferably 2.2 - 4.2.<br>
When the average L/D value of particles of 75 mm or<br>
less is less than 2.0, the plastic deformation<br>
properties and the moldability are deteriorated, which<br>
is not preferred. When the average L/D value of<br>
particles of 75 mm or less is more than 4.5, the<br>
fluidity and the disintegrating property are deterio-<br>
rated, which is not preferred. Moreover, the mold-<br>
ability tends to be deteriorated probably because the<br>
cellulose fiber attains fibrousness and tends to have<br>
elastic recovery.<br>
Average yield pressure is employed as an<br>
indication of the plastic deformation properties of<br>
powder. The lower the value of the average yield<br>
pressure, the higher the plastic deformation properties<br>
and compression moldability of the powder. The highly<br><br>
moldable excipient of the present invention preferably<br>
has an average yield pressure of 35 MPa or less when<br>
0.5 g of this powder is compressed to 10 MPa. When the<br>
average yield pressure is more than 35 MPa, the<br>
moldability is deteriorated, which is not preferred.<br>
The average yield pressure is preferably, in<br>
particular, 30 MPa or less.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
should have an apparent specific volume of 4.0 - 7.0<br>
cmVg. When the apparent specific volume is less than<br>
4.0 cmVg, the moldability is deteriorated. When the<br>
apparent specific volume is more than 7.0 cmVg, the<br>
disintegrating property and the fluidity are deterio-<br>
rated, which is not preferred. Moreover, the mold-<br>
ability tends to be deteriorated probably because the<br>
cellulose fiber attains fibrousness and tends to have<br>
elastic recovery. The apparent specific volume is<br>
preferably 4.0 - 6.5 cmVg, in particular, 4.2 - 6.0<br>
cmVg.<br>
The apparent tapping specific volume of the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention should be 2.4<br>
- 4.5 cmVg, preferably 2.4 - 4.0 cmVg, in particular,<br>
2.4 - 3.5 cmVg. Even when the apparent specific volume<br>
is in a range of 4.0 - 7.0 cmVg, if the apparent<br>
tapping specific volume is less than 2.4 cmVg, the<br>
disintegrating property of tablets prepared from the<br>
cellulose powder are undesirably deteriorated because<br>
of excessive consolidation.<br><br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
should have an angle of repose of 55° or less. When<br>
the angle of repose of the cellulose powder is more<br>
than 55°, its fluidity is remarkably deteriorated.<br>
Particularly when tablets are produced by blending a<br>
large amount of an active ingredient with poor<br>
fluidity, the weight variation of the tablets becomes<br>
remarkable if the fluidity of the excipient for<br>
compression molding is low, so that the tablets cannot<br>
be put to practical use. The angle of repose of the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention is preferably<br>
54° or less, more preferably 53° or less, in<br>
particular, 52° or less. The term "angle of repose"<br>
used herein means an angle of repose measured by a<br>
powder tester (mfd. by Hosokawa Micron Corporation)<br>
after adjusting the water content of the powder to 3.5<br>
to 4.5%. To impart such high fluidity, the cellulose<br>
powder preferably has compressibility [%] (= 100 x<br>
(apparent tapping density [g/cm3] - apparent density<br>
[g/cm3] ) / apparent tapping density [g/cm3]) in a<br>
specific range. The compressibility is preferably in a<br>
range of approximately 30 - 50%, more preferably 30 -<br>
49%, in particular, 30 ~ 47%.<br>
The terms "apparent tapping density" and<br>
"apparent density" used herein mean the reciprocal<br>
numbers of the apparent tapping specific volume and<br>
apparent specific volume, respectively, defined herein.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br><br>
preferably has a specific surface area of 85 m7g or<br>
more as measured by water vapor adsorption. When the<br>
specific surface area is less than 85 itiVg, an area for<br>
water infiltration into particles is small and hence<br>
the amount of conduits of the tablets prepared from the<br>
cellulose powder is small, to lower disintegrating<br>
property of the tablets, which is not preferred.<br>
Although the upper limit of the specific surface area<br>
is not particularly limited, that of the cellulose<br>
powder before drying is about 200 mVg as a measure<br>
because specific surface area is considered as a value<br>
which is decreased by drying.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
preferably has a specific surface area in a range of<br>
0.5 - 4.0 mVg as measured by a nitrogen adsorption<br>
method. When the specific surface area is less than<br>
0.5 mVg, the moldability is deteriorated, which is not<br>
preferred. When the specific surface area is more than<br>
4.0 mVg, the disintegrating property are remarkably<br>
deteriorated, which is preferred. The specific surface<br>
area is preferably 0.8 - 3.8 mVg, more preferably 0.8 -<br>
3.5 mVg.<br>
When the nitrogen specific surface area is<br>
increased, spaces among particles (i.e. conduits) are<br>
crushed during compression, so that the disintegrating<br>
property tend to be deteriorated. However, even if the<br>
nitrogen specific surface area is high, as long as the<br>
nitrogen specific surface area is in a definite range,<br><br>
the amount of the conduits can be maintained to prevent<br>
the deterioration of the disintegrating property, by<br>
controlling the water vapor specific surface area at a<br>
definite value or more. A practical physical property<br>
value indicating the moldability is the hardness of a<br>
molded product. The higher this hardness, the higher<br>
the compression moldability. A practical physical<br>
property value indicating the disintegrating property<br>
is the disintegration time of a molded product. The<br>
shorter this disintegration time, the better the<br>
disintegrating property. The balance between the<br>
tablet hardness and disintegration time of a molded<br>
product obtained by compression at a high striking<br>
pressure is important in practice, considering that the<br>
disintegrating property are generally deteriorated with<br>
an increase of the hardness and that the compression at<br>
a high striking pressure is unavoidable because many<br>
active ingredients for medicine or the like have low<br>
moldability.<br>
The breaking load in the direction of<br>
diameter of a cylindrical molded product with a<br>
diameter of 1.13 cm obtained by compressing 0.5 g of<br>
the cellulose powder of the present invention at 20 MPa<br>
for 10 seconds is preferably 170 N or more, more<br>
preferably 180 N or more, in particular, 190 N or more.<br>
The disintegration time (a solution in pure water at<br>
37°C, a disc is present) of the cylindrical molded<br>
product is preferably 130 seconds or less, more prefer-<br><br>
ably 120 seconds or less, in particular, 100 seconds or<br>
less. The breaking load in the direction of diameter<br>
of a cylindrical molded product with a diameter of 1.13<br>
cm obtained by compressing 0.5 g of a mixture of equal<br>
amounts of the cellulose powder of the present inven-<br>
tion and lactose (Pharmatose 100M, available from DMV<br>
Corp.) at 80 MPa for 10 seconds is preferably 150 N or<br>
more, more preferably 170 N or more, in particular, 180<br>
N or more. The disintegration time (a solution in pure<br>
water at 37°C, a disc is present) of this cylindrical<br>
molded product is preferably 120 seconds or less, more<br>
preferably 110 seconds or less, in particular, 90<br>
seconds or less.<br>
In addition, a cylindrical molded product<br>
with a diameter of 0.8 cm obtained by compressing 0.05<br>
g of the cellulose powder of the present invention at<br>
90 MPa for 10 seconds preferably has adsorption<br>
characteristics represented by the following equation<br>
(1), after its immersion treatment with acetonitrile<br>
solvent:<br>
In[9e/ (9e-6) ] = Ka-t (1)<br>
wherein Ka &gt; 0.0200 min"1, 9e is the saturated water<br>
vapor adsorption rate [%] of tablets at a relative<br>
humidity of 55% RH, and 9 is the water vapor adsorption<br>
rate [%] of the tablets at a relative humidity of 55%<br>
RH and a water vapor adsorption time of t [min.]).<br>
The term "immersion treatment with aceto-<br>
nitrile solvent" used herein means immersing the<br><br>
cylindrical molded product in acetonitrile solvent fcr<br>
48 hours to permeate the same with the acetonitrile<br>
solvent sufficiently, and drying the cylindrical molded<br>
product at 25°C in a nitrogen stream until the relative<br>
humidity becomes 0% RH. In the case where the occur-<br>
rence of moisture absorption or adsorption during<br>
operations is conjectured, for example, the case where<br>
the linearity of the equation (1) is low, the cellulose<br>
surface should be cleaned by vacuum drying with heat.<br>
When the Ka value is less than 0.0200 min"1, the adsorp-<br>
tion rate of water is slow, so that the disintegration<br>
time tends to be prolonged, which is not preferred.<br>
The effect of the immersion treatment with acetonitrile<br>
solvent is conjectured as follows. The compression of<br>
the cellulose powder causes an increase of inter-<br>
particle hydrogen bonds and crush of micro-spaces<br>
(conduits) in particles. When the cylindrical molded<br>
product compressed to have a high density is immersed<br>
in acetonitrile, acetonitrile enters the micro-spaces<br>
(conduits) in particles but not sites of the inter-<br>
particle hydrogen bonds to increase the diameter of the<br>
conduits.<br>
That is, it can be speculated that with an<br>
increase of the number of the inner-particle micro-<br>
spaces (conduits) in the cellulose powder which remain<br>
in tablets after the compression, the acetonitrile<br>
solvent permeates the cellulose powder more easily to<br>
increase the diameter of the conduits to give higher<br><br>
water vapor adsorption rate of the tablets. It can<br>
also be speculated that since such tablets adsorb water<br>
rapidly, their disintegration time in water is reduced.<br>
Although the upper limit of the Ka value is not<br>
particularly limited, the Ka value is preferably 0.0400<br>
min"1 or less because with an increase of the Ka value,<br>
the disintegration time tends to be reduced. The Ka<br>
value is preferably in a range of 0.0210 - 0.0400 min"1,<br>
more preferably 0.0220 - 0.0400 min"1.<br>
A process for producing cellulose powder of<br>
the present invention needs to comprise: i) obtaining a<br>
cellulose dispersion containing cellulose particles<br>
wherein, a) an average polymerization degree is 150 -<br>
450, and b) the average L/D value in wet state is 3.0 -<br>
5.5, by controlling a solution-stirring force in<br>
hydrolyzing a natural cellulosic material or in a<br>
subsequent step, and ii) spray-drying the thus obtained<br>
cellulose dispersion at an article temperature lower<br>
than 100°C.<br>
The natural cellulosic material referred to<br>
herein is a vegetable fibrous material derived from a<br>
natural material containing cellulose, such as wood,<br>
bamboo, cotton, ramie or the like and is preferably a<br>
material having a crystalline structure of cellulose I<br>
type. From the viewpoint of production yield, the<br>
natural cellulosic material is preferably pulp obtained<br>
by purifying such natural materials and preferably has<br>
an a-cellulose content of 85% or more.<br><br>
Conditions for obtaining the cellulose<br>
dispersion having an average polymerization degree of<br>
150 - 450 are, for example, carrying out the hydrolysis<br>
under mild conditions in a 0.1 - 4N aqueous hydro-<br>
chloric acid solution at 20 - 60°C. However, when the<br>
cellulosic material is hydrolyzed to the level-off<br>
polymerization degree, the L/D value of particles is<br>
liable to be decreased by stirring operation in the<br>
production process, so that the moldability is<br>
deteriorated, which is not preferred.<br>
Particles in the cellulose dispersion before<br>
drying preferably such that, have the average L/D value<br>
of the particles capable of remaining on 75- to 38-um<br>
screens in a range of 3.0 - 5.5, more preferably 3.2 -<br>
5.2, when sieved (through JIS standard screens) in a<br>
wet state. Since particles in the cellulose dispersion<br>
are aggregated by drying, resulting in a small L/D<br>
value, cellulose powder having a high moldability and<br>
good disintegrating property can be obtained by keeping<br>
the average L/D value of particles before drying in a<br>
definite range. The average L/D value of particles<br>
before drying can be kept in the definite range by<br>
controlling a stirring force in the hydrolyzing<br>
reaction or in a subsequent step at a specific<br>
intensity.<br>
The stirring during the reaction or in the<br>
subsequent step shortens cellulose fiber. When the<br>
stirring is too vigorous, the average L/D value of<br><br>
particles is decreased, so that no sufficient mold-<br>
ability can be attained. Therefore, the stirring force<br>
should be controlled so that the average L/D value of<br>
particles becomes 3.0 or more. When the stirring is<br>
too mild, the fibrousness is enhanced, resulting in a<br>
low moldability and remarkably deteriorated<br>
disintegrating property. Therefore, the stirring force<br>
is preferably maintained so that the average L/D value<br>
of particles is not more than 5.5.<br>
The intensity of the stirring force can be<br>
controlled, for example, in consideration of P/V<br>
(kg-m"1-sec"3) value obtained by the empirical equation<br>
(2) described below. The P/V value, however, is not an<br>
absolute numerical value because it is dependent on the<br>
size and shape of a agitation vessel, the size and<br>
shape of an agitating blade, the number of revolutions,<br>
the number of turning blades, etc. The maximum value<br>
of P/V in each step-before drying ranges from 0.01 to<br>
10,000, and the lower and upper limits of P/V can be<br>
determined by controlling the number of revolutions,<br>
depending on the kind of the agitation vessel and the<br>
agitating blade. It is sufficient that the lower and<br>
upper limits is properly determined by comparing values<br>
of P/V obtained by varying the agitation vessel used<br>
and the number of revolutions of the agitating blade<br>
with the average L/D value of particles of 75 urn to 38<br>
\m, for example, as follow: P/V is adjusted so as to<br>
fall within a range of 0.3 to 80 in the case where Np «¦<br><br>
8/,V = 0.03 and d = 0.3; P/V is adjusted so as to fall<br>
within a range of 0.01 to 5 in the case where Np = 2.2,<br>
V = 0.07 and d = 0.05; and P/V is adjusted so as to<br>
fall within a range of 1 to 10,000 in the case where Np<br>
« 2.2, V - 1 and d = 1.<br>
P/V = (Np x p x n3 x d5)/V (2)<br>
wherein Np (-) is a power number of impeller, p (kg/m3)<br>
is the density of a liquid, n (rps) is the number of<br>
revolutions of the agitating blade, d (m) is the<br>
diameter of the agitating blade, and V (m3) is the<br>
volume of the liquid.<br>
The cellulose dispersion obtained by the<br>
above procedure should be made into powder by drying.<br>
The IC (electric conductivity) value of the cellulose<br>
dispersion before drying which has been washed and<br>
subjected to pH adjustment after the reaction is<br>
preferably 200 |iS/cm or less- When the IC value is<br>
more than 200 nS/cm,' the dispersibility of particles in<br>
water is deteriorated, resulting in unsatisfactory<br>
disintegration. The IC value is preferably 150 nS/cm<br>
or less, more preferably 100 |aS/cm or less. In<br>
preparing the cellulose dispersion, besides water,<br>
water containing a low proportion of an organic solvent<br>
may be used so long as it does not lessen the effect of<br>
the present invention.<br>
For obtaining cellulose powder having a good<br>
balance among moldability, fluidity and disintegrating<br>
property, spray drying is preferably conducted at an<br><br>
article temperature lower than 100°C. The term<br><br>
"article temperature" used herein means exhaust temper-<br>
ature, not inlet temperature, in the spray drying. In<br>
the spray drying, aggregated particles in the cellulose<br>
dispersion after the reaction are consolidated by heat<br>
shrinkage stress applied from all directions to be<br>
densified (become heavy-duty) and attain a good<br>
fluidity. Furthermore, the aggregated particles attain<br>
good disintegrating property because of weak hydrogen<br>
bonds among them. The concentration of the cellulose<br>
dispersion before the drying is preferably 25 wt% or<br>
less, more preferably 20 wt% or less. When the<br>
concentration of the cellulose dispersion is too high,<br>
particles are excessively aggregated during the drying<br>
and hence the average L/D value of the particles after<br>
drying is decreased, so that the bulk density is<br>
increased to give a low moldability, which is<br>
undesirable. The lower limit of the concentration of<br>
the cellulose dispersion is preferably 1 wt% or more.<br>
When the lower limit is less than 1 wt%, the fluidity<br>
is deteriorated, which is not preferred. Moreover,<br>
such a lower limit is not desirable from the viewpoint<br>
of productivity because it raises the cost.<br>
As compared with the drying method according<br>
to the present invention in which the spray drying is<br>
conducted at an article temperature lower than 100°C,<br>
the methods as described in JP-A-6-316535 and JP-A-11-<br>
152233 wherein a cellulose dispersion is heated at a<br>
temperature of 100°C or higher and then subjected to<br><br>
spray drying or drum drying, or a cellulose dispersion<br>
is dried in the form of a thin film without heating,<br>
are not preferable because hydrogen bonds among<br>
aggregated particles are firmly formed, so that the<br>
disintegrating property is deteriorated in these<br>
methods. In these methods, cellulose particles in a<br>
slurry are easily aggregated in the state where the<br>
particles are arranged along the direction of their<br>
major axis even if the L/D value of particles before<br>
drying is less than the lower limit of a specific<br>
range. Therefore, the decrease of the L/D value of<br>
particles by drying can be suppressed to give good<br>
moldability. However, disintegrating property and<br>
fluidity cannot be imparted together with the<br>
moldability. Cellulose powder having good fluidity and<br>
disintegrating property in addition to good moldability<br>
can be obtained only by controlling the L/D value of<br>
particles to be within a specific range before drying<br>
and conducting spray drying at an article temperature<br>
lower than 100°C. For controlling the L/D value of<br>
particles before drying to be within a specific range,<br>
it is preferred to carry out hydrolysis under<br>
conditions where the average polymerization degree does<br>
not reach a level-off polymerization degree, as<br>
described above.<br>
In addition, for the cellulose powder<br>
obtained by drum drying or thin film drying, it is<br>
essential to grind it after the drying in order to<br><br>
impart desirable powder physical properties. However,<br>
when all particles are ground, the amount of static<br>
electricity generated by friction among the particles<br>
becomes large probably because the surfaces of the<br>
particles become non-dense and uneven. This generation<br>
of a large amount of static electricity is not prefer-<br>
able because it also causes deterioration of the<br>
fluidity. However, the cellulose powder may be ground<br>
after the drying as long as the effect of the present<br>
invention is not lessened.<br>
A method in which a slurry before drying is<br>
dried after complete or excessive replacement of a<br>
solvent in the slurry with an organic solvent is not<br>
desirable because capillary force at the time of the<br>
evaporation of the organic solvent through spaces among<br>
particles is weak as compared with water, so that the<br>
formation of interparticle hydrogen bonds is<br>
suppressed. Therefore, the nitrogen specific surface<br>
area is increased too much to deteriorate the<br>
disintegrating property, which is not preferred. The<br>
proportion of the organic solvent added is 50 wt% or<br>
less, preferably 30 wt% or less, in particular, 20 wt%<br>
or less, based on the weight of the solvent in the<br>
slurry. Employment of a large amount of the organic<br>
solvent is not preferred because it requires large-<br>
scale equipments such as an explosion-proof drying<br>
equipment and an equipment for recovering the organic<br>
solvent and hence entails a high cost.<br><br>
The loss in weight on drying of the cellulose<br>
powder of the present invention is preferably in a<br>
range of 8% or less. When the loss in weight on drying<br>
is more than 8%, the moldability is deteriorated, which<br>
is not preferred.<br>
The excipient referred to herein is that used<br>
as a binder, disintegrating agent, granulation<br>
assistant, filler, fluidizing agent or the like in the<br>
formulation of an active ingredient into a pharma-<br>
ceutical composition by a well-known method in<br>
medicinal, food or industrial applications. The<br>
excipient is preferably an excipient for compression<br>
molding having an excellent balance among compression<br>
moldability, disintegrating property and fluidity.<br>
The molded product referred to herein is a<br>
molded product containing the cellulose powder of the<br>
present invention and obtained by processing by well-<br>
known methods properly selected from mixing, stirring,<br>

confectionery, health food, texture improvers, and<br>
dietary fiber supplements), solid foundations, bath<br><br>
agents, animal drugs, diagnostic drugs, agrochemicals,<br>
fertilizers, ceramics catalysts, etc.<br>
It is sufficient that the molded product<br>
referred to herein contains the cellulose powder of the<br>
present invention. Although the content of the<br>
cellulose powder is not particularly limited, it should<br>
be 1 wt% or more based on the weight of the molded<br>
product. When the content is less than 1 wt%, satis-<br>
factory physical properties cannot be imparted to the<br>
molded product; for example, the molded product is woirn<br>
away or destroyed. The content is preferably 3 wt% or<br>
more, more preferably 5 wt% or more.<br>
Furthermore, the molded product referred to<br>
herein may freely contain, besides the cellulose powder<br>
of the present invention, other additives such as<br>
active ingredients, disintegrating agents, binders,<br>
fluidizing agents, lubricants, correctives, flavoring<br>
materials, coloring matters, sweeteners, surfactants,<br>
etc. if necessary.<br>

pyrrolidone)s, carboxyvinyl polymers, poly(vinyl<br>
alcohol)s, etc.; and inorganic compounds such as<br>
calcium hydrogenphosphate, calcium carbonate, synthetic<br>

The fluidizing agents include hydrated<br>
silicon dioxide, light silicic anhydride, etc. The<br>

stevia, maltose, maltitol, thick malt syrup, powdered<br>
sweet hydrangea leaf, etc. The surfactants include<br>
phospholipids, glycerin fatty acid esters, polyethylene<br>
glycol fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters,<br>
polyoxyethylenes, hydrogenated castor oil, etc.<br>
The active ingredient referred to herein<br>
includes pharmaceutically active ingredients,<br>
agrochemical ingredients, ingredients for fertilizer,<br>
ingredients for feed, ingredients for food, ingredients<br>
for cosmetic, coloring matters, flavoring materials,<br>
metals, ceramics, catalysts, surfactants, etc., and may<br>
be in any form such as powder, crystals, oil, solution<br>
or the like. The active ingredient may be that coated<br>
for, for example, the control of dissolution and<br>
release or the reduction of a bitter taste.<br>
For example, the pharmaceutically active<br>
ingredients are those administered orally, such as<br>
antipyretic analgesic antiphlogistics, hypnotic<br>
sedatives, sleepiness inhibitors, dinics, infant<br>
analgesics, stomachics, antacids, digestives,<br>
cardiotonics, drugs for arrhythmia, hypotensive drugs,<br>
vasodilators, diuretics, antiulcer drugs, drugs for<br>
controlling intestinal function, therapeutic drugs for<br>
osteoporosis, antitussive expectorants, antasthmatics,<br>
antibacterials, drugs for pollakiurea, tonics, vitamin<br><br>
preparations, etc.<br>
The content of the active ingredient(s) in<br>
the molded product of the present invention is 0.01 to<br>
99 wt% based on the weight of the molded product. When<br>
the content of the active ingredient(s) is less than<br>
0.01 wt%, no sufficient drug efficacy can be expected.<br>
When the content is more than 99 wt%, the content of<br>
the excipient is not sufficient, so that satisfactory<br>
physical properties cannot be imparted; for example,<br>
the molded product is worn away or destroyed.<br>
When the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention is used in the case where the content of the<br>
active ingredient(s) in the molded product is high, it<br>
is especially advantageous because it has, for example,<br>
the following advantages: it can impart a sufficient<br>
moldability without accelerating the retardation of<br>
disintegration even at a high striking pressure; it<br>
permits reduction of the amount of the cellulose powder<br>
to be added and hence miniaturization of the molded<br>
product; and the degree of wear of the resulting<br>
tablets is low and their powdering and breakage during<br>
packing into bottles and transportation is minimal.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention is<br>
advantageous when the content of the active<br>
ingredient(s) is 5 wt% or more, preferably 10 wt% or<br>
more, still more preferably 30 wt% or more, in<br>
particular, 50 wt% or more.<br>
Since the cellulose powder of the present<br><br>
invention has an excellent compression moldability, it<br>
can be molded with a small blending amount thereof or a<br>
low compressive force and hence is very suitable for<br>
tabletting the active ingredient(s). The cellulose<br>
powder of the present invention enables the tabletting<br>
of a pharmaceutically active ingredient with poor<br>
moldability, the miniaturization of large tablets of a<br>
Chinese orthodox medicine, crude drug, cold remedy,<br>
vitamin preparation or the like, and the preparation of<br>
intraoral rapidly soluble tablets, granule-containing<br>
tablets, or the like.<br>
The tablets referred to herein are molded<br>
products containing the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention and optionally other additives and obtained<br>
by any of a direct tabletting method, a granule<br>
compression method and an extra-granulation method.<br>
Tablets obtained by direct compression are especially<br>
preferable.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
is especially advantageously used for an active<br>
ingredient for medicine having a low moldability,<br>
because of the advantages, for example, that compres-<br>
sion into tablets can be carried out at a high striking<br>
pressure without accelerating the retardation of<br>
disintegration. Whether the moldability is low or not<br>
can be determined by the hardness of tablets obtained<br>
by placing 0.5 g of the pharmaceutically active<br>
ingredient in a die (manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho<br><br>
Ltd. from material SUK 2,3) and compressing the active<br>
ingredient with a flat punch and a base area of 1 cm2<br>
(manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd. from material<br>
SUK 2,3) until the pressure becomes 100 MPa (a static<br>
compressing machine such as PCM-1A manufactured by<br>
Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. is used and the compression<br>
rate is approximately 20 - 30 cm/min). The cellulose<br>
powder of the present invention is especially<br>
effectively used when the tablet hardness of the<br>
pharmaceutically active ingredient is less than 100 N,<br>
preferably less than 50 N, more preferably less than 10<br>
N. Such a drug includes phenacetin, acetaminophen,<br>
ethenzamide, etc.<br>
When the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention is used in combination with a fluidizing<br>
agent and a disintegrating agent, tablets especially<br>
excellent in moldability and disintegrating property<br>
can be produced without deteriorating the fluidity<br>
during the production of the tablets. As the<br>
disintegrating agent, a super-disintegrating agent such<br>
as sodium croscarmellose (e.g. "Ac-Di-Sol" manufactured<br>
by FMC Corp.) is preferably used because it is<br>
effective even when added in a small amount. As the<br>
fluidizing agent, light silicic anhydride is especially<br>
preferable, and the fluidizing agent includes "Aerosil"<br>
(mfd. by Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.), "Carplex" (mfd. by<br>
Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd.), "Cyroid" (mfd. by Fuji Davisson<br>
Co., Ltd.), "Adsolider" (mfd. by Freund Sangyo K.K.),<br><br>
etc. Although the proportions of the components<br>
described above are not particularly limited, suitable<br>
examples thereof are as follows: the microcrystalline<br>
cellulose of the present invention 1 to 99 wt%, the<br>
disintegrating agent 0.5 to 20 wt%, and the fluidizing<br>
agent 0.1 to 5 wt%.<br>
It is preferable to adopt a method comprising<br>
premixing the active ingredient(s) and the fluidizing<br>
agent at first, mixing therewith the cellulose powder<br>
of the present invention, the disintegrating agent and<br>
optionally other additives, and then making the result-<br>
ing mixture into tablets, because this method gives<br>
higher fluidity and moldability than a method in which<br>
all the components are mixed at once. With a decrease<br>
of the fluidity of the active ingredient(s) and an<br>
increase of the proportion of the active ingredient(s),<br>
the timing of addition of the fluidizing agent has a<br>
more remarkable effect.<br>
Particularly when rapidly-disintegrating<br>
property is required, the molded product of the present<br>
invention is especially effective since the molded<br>
product of the present invention can have a sufficient<br>
hardness even when produced at a low striking pressure<br>
and thus may be made thick, so that many conduits can<br>
be left in the molded product. The term "rapidly-<br>
disintegrating property" means that a molded product is<br>
disintegrated within 1 minute in a medium such as<br>
water, artificial gastric juice, artificial intestinal<br><br>
juice, saliva or the like. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
having such a characteristic include intraoral rapidly-<br>
soluble tablets, intraoral rapidly-disintegrable<br>
tablets, etc.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
is very suitable also for tabletting, for example,<br>
granules each having a coating film. When a mixture of<br>
coated granules, the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention and optionally other additives are made into<br>
tablets, a practical hardness can be attained even if<br>
the compression stress is greatly reduced. Therefore,<br>
damages to the coating films by the compression stress<br>
can be suppressed, so that the mixture can be made into<br>
tablets while enabling the granules to retain their<br>
expected dissolving and releasing properties.<br>
The active ingredient vulnerable to compres-<br>
sion herein is, for example, an active ingredient which<br>
is inactivated by compression stress or heat, or an<br>
active ingredient which cannot exhibit expected<br>
dissolving and releasing properties because the coating<br>
portion of the active ingredient is damaged by<br>
pressure.<br>
The molded product containing a coated active<br>
ingredient(s) of the present invention refers to a<br>
molded product having the molded product form defined<br>
above, such as powder, granular preparations (e.g. fine<br>
granules or granules), or the like and containing one<br>
or more active ingredients, wherein the active<br><br>
ingredient(s) per se is coated with a film; particles<br>
made of the active ingredient(s) and additives are<br>
coated with a film; the active ingredient(s) is coated<br>
by granulating a mixture of the active ingredient(s)<br>
and a coating agent; or the mixture thereof. The<br>
coating agent is used, for example, masking a taste,<br>
imparting sustained-release properties or enteric<br>
properties, or preventing moisture, and includes, for<br>
example, cellulose type coating agents (e.g. ethyl<br>
cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate,<br>
carboxymethylethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl<br>
cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose acetate<br>
succinate, cellulose acetate phthalate, and cellulose<br>
acetate), acrylic polymer type coating agents (e.g.<br>
Eudragit RS, Eudragit L and Eudragit NE), shellac and<br>
silicone resins. These may be used singly or in<br>
combination. As a method for using these coating<br>
agents, a well-known method may be used. The coating<br>
agent may be dissolved in an organic solvent or<br>
suspended in water. The coating agent suspended in<br>
water may be freely granulated together with one or<br>
more active ingredients for medicine and other<br>
components.<br>
With an increase of the proportion of the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention blended in<br>
the molded product containing one or more coated active<br>
ingredients of the present invention, the suppression<br>
of the damage to the coating film by the cellulose<br><br>
powder becomes more effective. The proportion to be<br>
blended is preferably 1 to 90 wt%. When the proportion<br>
is less than 1 wt%, no sufficient effect can be<br>
obtained. When the proportion is more than 90 wt%, the<br>
proportion of the active ingredient(s) is undesirably<br>
insufficient. The proportion is more preferably 5 to<br>
80 wt%, in particular, 5 to 70 wt%.<br>
The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
can be used in wet granulation as, for example, a<br>
reinforcing agent for a sugar coating in sugar-coated<br>
tablets, an extrudability improver in extrusion<br>
granulation, or a granulation assistant in crushing<br>
granulation, fluidized-bed granulation, high-shear<br>
granulation, tumbling fluidized-bed granulation or the<br>
like, and permits preparation of a granular pharma-<br>
ceutical composition or granules to be compressed into<br>
tablets. For preparing the granules to be compressed<br>
into tablets, a dry granulation method may be adopted.<br>
In addition, tabletting by the method wherein the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention is added to<br>
such granules that are obtained by a well-known method<br>
and the mixture is compression molded (an extra-<br>
granulation method) is also applicable. Since the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention has high<br>
water absorption properties, the rate of granulation<br>
can be reduced even when a highly water-soluble<br>
pharmaceutical active ingredient is granulated. It,<br>
therefore, reduces the formation of coarse particles<br><br>
and, thus, contributes to the increase of granulation<br>
yield. The cellulose powder of the present invention<br>
gives a bulky granulation product because of its low<br>
particle density and hence contributes also to the<br>
preparation of granules for compression tabletting with<br>
high compression moldability. Furthermore, the<br>
cellulose powder of the present invention may be<br>
blended into a powder in order to, for example, prevent<br>
blocking or improve the fluidity, or it may be blended<br>
into capsules in order to, for example, improve the<br>
degree of filling.<br>
The present invention is described in detail<br>
by way of the following examples, which do not limit<br>
the scope of the invention. Method for measuring<br>
physical properties in the examples and comparative<br>
examples are as follows.<br>
1) Average polymerization degree<br>
A value measured by the copper ethylene-<br>
diamine solution viscosity method described in the<br>
crystalline cellulose identification test (3) in the<br>
13th revised Japanese Pharmacopoeia.<br>
2) L/D of particles before drying<br>
The average L/D value of particles in a<br>
cellulose dispersion before drying was measured as<br>
follows. The cellulose dispersion was sifted through<br>
JIS standard screens (Z8801-1987), and a photo-<br>
micrograph of particles that had passed through a 75-um<br>
screen and had remained on a 38-(jm screen was subjected<br><br>
to image analysis processing (apparatus: Hyper 700,<br>
software: Imagehyper, manufactured by Interquest Inc.).<br>
L/D of the particles was defined as the ratio between<br>
the long side and short side (long side/short side) of<br>
a rectangle having the smallest area among rectangles<br>
circumscribed about any of the particles. As the<br>
average L/D value of the particles, the average of the<br>
L/D values of at least 100 of the particles was used.<br>
3) Loss in weight on drying [%]<br>
After 1 g of powder was dried at 105°C for 3<br>
hours, the loss in weight was expressed as a percentage<br>
by weight.<br>
4) Proportion of particles capable of remaining on a<br>
250-mm screen [%]<br>
Using a low-tap type sieve shaker (Sieve<br>
Shaker Model A, mfd. by Heikoh Seisaku-sho Co., Ltd.),<br>
10 g of a sample was sifted through a JIS standard<br>
screen (Z8801-1987) with a screen opening of 250 mm for<br>
10 minutes, and the weight of particles remaining on<br>
the 250-mm screen was expressed as a percentage by<br>
weight based on the total weight.<br>
5) Average L/D value of particles of 75 mm or less<br>
A photomicrograph of particles that had<br>
passed through a 75-mm JIS standard screen in sifting<br>
with Air Jet Sieve (Model A200LS, mfd. by ALPINE) was<br>
subjected to image analysis processing (apparatus:<br>
Hyper 700, software: Imagehyper, manufactured by<br>
Interquest Inc.). L/D was defined as the ratio between<br><br>
the long side and short side (long side/short side) of<br>
a rectangle having the smallest area among rectangles<br>
circumscribed about any of the particles. As the<br>
average L/D value of the particles, the average of the<br>
L/D values of at least 400 of the particles was used..<br>
The average L/D value should be measured<br>
after previously making the particles discrete so that<br>
they are not entangled with one another.<br>
6) Apparent specific volume [cm3/g]<br>
A powder sample was roughly packed into a<br>
100-cm3 glass measuring cylinder over a period of 2 - 3<br>
minutes by the use of a metering feeder or the like,<br>
and the top surface of the powder layer was made level<br>
with a soft brush such as a writing brush, after which<br>
the volume of the powder sample was read. The apparent<br>
specific volume was expressed as a value obtained by<br>
dividing the read value by the weight of the powder<br>
sample. The weight of the powder was properly<br>
determined so that its volume might be approximately 70<br>
- 100 cm3.<br>
7) Apparent tapping specific volume [cmVg]<br>
Using a commercial powder physical property<br>
measuring machine (Powder Tester Model T-R, mfd. by<br>
Hosokawa Micron Corporation), a 100-cm3 cup was filled<br>
with powder and tapped 180 times. Then, the apparent<br>
tapping specific volume was calculated by dividing the<br>
volume of the cup by the weight of the powder layer<br>
remaining in the cup.<br><br>
8) Angle of repose [°]<br>
The water content of powder (measured by<br>
means of an infrared moisture meter (Model FD-220, mfd.<br>
by KETT Science Laboratory; lg, 105°C)) was adjusted to<br>
3.5 - 4.5%. Thereafter, using a commercial powder<br>
physical property measuring machine (Powder Tester<br>
Model T-R, mfd. by Hosokawa Micron Corporation), the<br>
powder fell under the following conditions: a metal<br>
funnel (made of a material incapable of generating<br>
static electricity) with an orifice diameter of 0.8 cm,<br>
and vibration graduation 1.5. The angles of the<br>
ridgelines (the angles of two ridgelines; measurement<br>
distance 3°) of a heap formed by the powder were<br>
measured. The angle of repose [°] was expressed as the<br>
average of three measurements.<br>
9) Compressibility [%]<br>
Compressibility was calculated by the<br>
following equation (3) by using the apparent specific<br>
volume and apparent tapping specific volume defined<br>
above:<br>
Compressibility = 100 x [(I/apparent tapping<br>
specific volume) - (I/apparent specific volume)] /<br>
(I/apparent tapping specific volume) (3)<br>
10) Average particle size [fom]<br>
Using a low-tap type sieve shaker (Sieve<br>
Shaker Model A, mfd. by Taira Kosaku-sho Co., Ltd.) and<br>
JIS standard screens (Z8801-1987), 10 g of a powder<br>
sample was sieved for 10 minutes to measure the<br><br>
particle size distribution. The average particle size<br>
was expressed as a particle size corresponding to a<br>
cumulative weight percentage of 50%.<br>
11) Water vapor specific surface area [irr/g]<br>
Using a dynamic water vapor adsorption<br>
apparatus DVS-1 (mfd. by Surface Measurement Systems<br>
Ltd.) and water vapor as an adsorption gas, the amount<br>
of water vapor adsorbed by a sample was measured in a<br>
range of 0 - 30% RH according to the measuring steps<br>
described below, and the water vapor specific surface<br>
area was calculated by a BET method. The calculation<br>
was carried out by taking the molecular occupied area<br>
of water as 8.lA. As the sample, 0.01 - 0.02 g of a<br>
sample obtained by removing water from about 0.10 g of<br>
cellulose powder by vacuum drying in 5-cm3 sample tube<br>
at 100°C for 3 hours was placed in the aforesaid<br>
apparatus and subjected to the measurement.<br>
(Measuring steps)<br>
The sample was allowed to stand at each of<br>
the following relative humidities for the following<br>
measurement time and the amount of water vapor adsorbed<br>
onto the sample was measured.<br>
Relative humidity Measurement time<br>
0% RH 200 min. or less<br>
3% RH 150 min. or less<br>
6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27 or 30% RH<br>
100 min. or less.<br><br>
12) Nitrogen adsorption specific surface area [mVg]<br>
Measured by a BET method using a Flowsorb<br>
II2300 manufactured by Shimadzu Corp. and nitrogen as<br>
an adsorption gas.<br>
13) Average yield pressure [MPa]<br>
The water content (measured by means of an<br>
infrared moisture meter (Model FD-220, mfd. by KETT<br>
Science Laboratory; lg, 105°C)) of powder was adjusted<br>
to 3.5 - 4.5%. Then, 0.5 g of a sample of the powder<br>
was placed in a die (manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho<br>
Ltd. from material SUK 2,3) and compressed with a flat<br>
punch having a base area of 1 cm2 (manufactured by<br>
Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd. from material SUK 2,3) until<br>
the pressure became 10 MPa (a compressing machine PCM-<br>
1A manufactured by Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. was used<br>
and the compression rate was adjusted to 1 cm/min). A<br>
stress P and the height h [cm] of the powder layer at<br>
the stress P were input into a computer at a data input<br>
rate of 0.02 second and recorded therein.<br>
The relationship between the stress P and<br>
In[l/(1 - D)] calculated from the volume V [cm3] of the<br>
powder layer at the stress P was graphically<br>
illustrated, followed by linear regression in a stress<br>
P [MPa] range of 2 - 10 MPa by a method of least<br>
squares. The average yield pressure was defined as the<br>
reciprocal number of the slope k of the regression<br>
line. V [cm3] was expressed as the product of the base<br>
area (1 cm2) of the punch with a flat surface and the<br><br>
height h [cm] of the powder layer at the stress P. The<br>
height h of the powder layer should be measured without<br>
strain in the system of the compressing machine (the<br>
total strain in the die, punch, load cell, plunger,<br>
etc.). D was calculated by the following equation (4):<br>
D = [(0.5 x (1 - W / 100)) / V] / 1.59 (4)<br>
wherein D is the packing rate of tablets, W is the<br>
water content [%] measured by means of an infrared<br>
moisture meter (Model FD-220, mfd. by KETT Science<br>
Laboratory; lg, 105°C), and the value 1.59 is the true<br>
density [g/cm3] of the cellulose powder measured with an<br>
air comparison type gravimeter (Pycnometer 930, mfd. by<br>
Beckmann AG).<br>
14) Water vapor adsorption rate of tablets Ka [1/min]<br>
A cylindrical molded product with a diameter<br>
of 0.8 cm obtained by compressing 0.05 g of a sample at<br>
90 MPa for 10 seconds (a compressing machine PCM-1A<br>
manufactured by Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. was used<br>
and the compression rate was adjusted to 29 cm/min) was<br>
immersed in acetonitrile (for liquid chromatography)<br>
for 48 hours, placed in a dynamic vapor adsorption<br>
measurement apparatus (Model DVS-1, mfd. by Microtec<br>
Nichion Co., Ltd.), and then dried at 25°C and a<br>
relative humidity of 0% RH in a nitrogen stream until<br>
the tablet weight reached sufficient equilibrium (the<br>
degree of variability of the weight for 5 minutes was<br>
0.0015%/ min or less). Then, the relative humidity was<br>
55% RH, and the tablet weight was recorded every<br><br>
1 minute until the tablet weight reached equilibrium<br>
(the degree of variability of the weight for 5 minutes<br>
was 0.0015%/ min or less). The relationship between<br>
the water vapor adsorption time t and In [6e/(0e-9) ] was<br>
graphically illustrated, followed by linear regression<br>
in a range of 20 - 100 minutes by a method of least<br>
squares. The slope of the regression line was taken as<br>
Ka. The saturated water vapor adsorption rate 0e[%] of<br>
the tablet at a relative humidity of 55% RH and the<br>
water vapor adsorption rate 6[%] of the tablet at a<br>
relative humidity of 55% RH and a water vapor adsorp-<br>
tion time of t were calculated as follows:<br>
9e = 100 x ms/m0 [%] (5)<br>
9 = 100 x mt/m0 [%] (6)<br>
wherein m0 is a tablet weight [g] at the time when<br>
equilibrium was sufficiently reached at a relative<br>
humidity of 0% RH, mt is a tablet weight [g] at a<br>
relative humidity of 55% RH and a water vapor adsorp-<br>
tion time of t, and ms is a tablet weight [g] at the<br>
time when equilibrium was sufficiently reached at a<br>
relative humidity of 55% RH.<br>
15) Hardness [N]<br>
Using a Schleuniger hardness meter (Model 6D,<br>
mfd. by Freund Sangyo K.K.), a load was applied to a<br>
cylindrical molded product or a tablet in the direction<br>
of diameter, and a load at the time of the destruction<br>
thereof was measured. The hardness was expressed as<br>
the number average of load values obtained for five<br><br>
samples. A cylindrical molded product of 100%<br>
cellulose powder and a cylindrical molded product of a<br>
mixture of equal amounts of cellulose powder and<br>
lactose were produced as follows. In a die (manufac-<br>
tured by Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd. from material SUK 2,3)<br>
was placed 0.5 g of a sample, and compressed with a<br>
flat punch having a diameter of 1.13 cm (base area: 1<br>
cm2) (manufactured by Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd. from<br>
material SUK 2,3). The cylindrical molded product of<br>
100% cellulose powder was produced by compression at 20<br>
MPa and maintenance of the compression stress for 10<br>
seconds (a compressing machine PCM-1A manufactured by<br>
Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. was used and the compres-<br>
sion rate was adjusted to about 10 cm/min). The<br>
cylindrical molded product of a mixture of equal<br>
amounts of cellulose powder and lactose was produced by<br>
compression at 8 0 MPa and maintenance of the compres-<br>
sion stress for 10 seconds (a compressing machine PCM-<br>
1A manufactured by Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. was used<br>
and the compression rate was adjusted to about 25<br>
cm/min).<br>
16) Disintegration time [seconds]<br>
A disintegration test was carried out<br>
according to the general test method and tablet<br>
disintegration test method prescribed in the 13th<br>
revised Japanese Pharmacopoeia. The disintegration<br>
time of cylindrical molded articles or tablets in pure<br>
water at 37°C was measured by means of a disintegration<br><br>
tester (Model NT-40HS, mfd. by Toyama Sangyo Co., Ltd.,<br>
fitted with a disc). The disintegration time was<br>
expressed as the number average of values measured for<br>
six samples.<br>
17) CV value of tablets [%]<br>
Ten tablets were accurately weighed and the<br>
CV value was defined as the coefficient of variation of<br>
the tablet weight.<br>
18) Degree of wear of tablets [%]<br>
The weight (Wa) of 20 tablets was measured,<br>
and the tablets were placed in a tablet degree-of-wear<br>
tester (mfd. by PTFR-A, PHARMA TEST), followed by<br>
revolution at 25 rpm for 4 minutes. Then, fine powder<br>
adhering to the tablets was removed and the weight (Wb)<br>
of the tablets was measured again. The degree of wear<br>
was calculated by the equation (7):<br>
Degree of wear = 100 x (Wa - Wb) / Wa (7)<br>
19) Rate of dissolution of a drug [%]<br>
The rate of dissolution is measured by a<br>
paddle method by using an automatic dissolution tester<br>
DT-610 (mfd. by Nippon Bunko Kogyo Co., Ltd.). As a<br>
test liquid, the first liquid among the test liquids in<br>
the general test method and degradation test method<br>
prescribed in the 13th revised Japanese Pharmacopoeia.<br>
The measurement was carried out three times and the<br>
average of the measured values was calculated.<br><br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Since the cellulose powder of the present<br>
invention is excellent in fluidity and disintegrating<br>
property while retaining a good compression mold-<br>
ability, the cellulose powder makes it possible to<br>
provide tablets having high hardness without retarda-<br>
tion of their disintegration, especially, even when the<br>
tablets are molded under a high striking pressure.<br>
Furthermore, the cellulose powder makes it possible to<br>
provide tablets which maintain their uniformity in<br>
weight even when their drug content is high and have a<br>
good balance between hardness and disintegrating<br>
property. Therefore, the cellulose powder of the<br>
present invention is very useful for miniaturizing, for<br>
example, tablets containing an active ingredient having<br>
a large specific volume, or tablets having a high<br>
content of an active ingredient. Moreover, in granule-<br>
containing tablets containing a coated active<br>
ingredient, the cellulose powder of the present inven-<br>
tion exhibits such an advantage that the compression<br>
molding of the tablets hardly destroys the granules,<br>
hardly damages the coating films of the granules and<br>
hardly cause a change in drug-releasing properties.<br><br>
