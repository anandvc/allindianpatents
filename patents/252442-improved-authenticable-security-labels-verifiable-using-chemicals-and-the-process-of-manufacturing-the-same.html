COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
"Improved authenticate security labels verifiable using chemicals and the process of manufacturing the same"<br>
PRS Solutions Private Limited, a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and having its office at 63, Bombay Samachar Marg, Mumbai - 400 001 Maharashtra State, India, Indian.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertain the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to "Improved authenticable security labels verifiable using chemicals and the process of manufacturing the same. The said labels have holographic image either on both sides or on any one side of a polymeric film. Such unique labels provide an end customer with benefits of 'seal of genuineness" of the articles, products, certificates, documents etc. by viewing either any hidden matter/message and/or another holographic layer after partial or complete removal of the metallic deposition on one of the sides of the holographic film by use of chemicals and save huge losses occurring to the brand owners due to counterfeiting.<br>
In one of the preferred embodiment of the present invention the hidden security matter can be printed on the side of the film from which the metallic deposition is chemically removed to view the matter. In another embodiment of the present invention the said matter can be printed with inks invisible to normal eye or inks giving one color under normal light and changing into another visible colour when viewed under ultra-violet radiation on at least one of the sides of the film. In yet another embodiment of the present invention the said label can be pasted on a matter printed with inks visible to normal eye and/or inks invisible to normal eye or inks having one colour visible under normal light and changing into another visible colour when viewed under ultra-violet radiation or infra red radiations.<br>
The said chemical can be filled in a container which is closed on all sides except one side where one small opening is provided and the said opening is blocked with a porous substance such as felt, wool, cotton etc. to allow the fluid from    the container to come out in<br><br><br>
controlled manner when the tip of the porous substance is rubbed against any hard surface such as the label.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART:<br>
Conventional holographic labels consist of plastic film like polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, coated with a very thin coat of Aluminium metal using vacuum coating technology to get metallised film. The metallised surface is embossed to get a holographic film. The holographic film is adhesive coated on the non embossed side to get holographic label. Ordinary Holographic labels are available in the market, which are easy to duplicate and are no more considered suitable for "Seal of genuineness".<br>
Scratch and read concept on documents are very common in the industry where a matter or number is printed and is covered with another printing of opaque ink. However, use of such concept is restricted to printed matters and is easily counterfeited/duplicated.<br>
Patent No. 195927 dated 7th July 2005 disclosed "Quadroscrach security device/label" using holographic films with added security features such as printing hidden messages which are revealed after removing the opaque metallised layer by mechanical scratching. Patent No. 196650 dated 31 October 2005 disclosed "holographic partial or full or scratchable labels having hidden security message printed with ultra violet activable ink" where hidden message is revealed when the top metal layer is pulled off with the help of another adhesive coated transparent polymeric film. Patent No. 196649 dated 31 October 2005 has disclosed use of "scratch and view holographic hide and two tier holographic tamper evident labels". All these patents have also disclosed use of invisible inks which become readable only<br><br><br>
under ultra violet radiation as one of the features for use as "Tamper evident labels".<br>
In all the three patents referred above the tamper evident film has a special release type of material which is loosely bonded on to the topside of the film and subsequently metallised from the same side to give a hiding effect to the message printed behind. Such special release coating require additional coating operations to be performed on the polymeric film and adds on to the cost. Further, mechanical scratching becomes difficult when the substrate on which such label is applied is soft or having curvatures which does not provide proper support for scratching activity to be performed.<br>
In order to overcome these difficulties and to provide a seal of genuineness at affordable cost an attempt has been made in the present invention to improve upon the concepts disclosed in the above referred patents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention is for Improved authenticable security labels verifiable using chemicals and the process of manufacturing the same. The holographic film used in this invention is commonly available in the market. All these holographic films use aluminium metal for giving metallic deposition on the film. Aluminium is known to be an amphoteric metal which reacts both with alkalies or acids to form colourless solutions. In the present invention a formulated chemical containing an alkali or acid or mixtures of alkali/s or acid/s has been used which when applied on the thin deposition of aluminium layer of holographic film react with aluminium metal and converts it into a<br><br><br>
colourless transparent substance thereby removing the opaque cover on top side of the film and reveals hidden matters printed either on top/first surface or on other/second surface of the film itself or on the substrate on which such labels are adhered to. In one of the embodiments the second surface of the film also has a holographic image as second layer of security. The said formulated chemical is filled in a container which is closed on all sides except one side where one small opening is provided and the said opening is blocked with a porous substance such as felt, wool, cotton etc. to allow the fluid from the container to come out in controlled manner when the tip of the porous substance is rubbed against any hard surface such as the label. In the alternative, the said chemical may also be applied directly on the label and rub to remove the metallic layer on the holographic film and view the hidden matter. The said chemical used for removing the metallic layer from the top side of the label is in the form of an aqueous solution and is having a alkalinity or acidity. The solution contains alkalies such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide or combination thereof or acids such as sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid or combination thereof.<br>
Product of this invention is best offered in the form of a label where the concept of this invention can be used with many probable embodiments some of which have been described in detail hereunder. The label consists of a plastic film that is a rigid polymer to provide a stable backing material for processing and it does not react with the subsequent coats and inks, which are printed on it. The film is subjected to aluminium coating done by the vacuum coating technique, at least on one side of the film using known method to get the metallised film. In the alterative the holographic films available in the market may be used.   This aluminium-coated (metallised) film is<br><br><br>
then embossed either in one step on one side using holographic master and known machine or on both sides in two separate steps as mentioned in one of the embodiment. The aluminium coated polymeric holographic film thus obtained is further processed for manufacturing of Improved authenticable security labels verifiable using chemicals having different possible constructions. The application details / construction of few probable embodiments of this invention will become more apparent from the descriptions and drawings which have been provided below:<br>
In one of the preferred embodiments (Figure 1) one side aluminium coated ( metallised) polymeric film is embossed on the metallised side using holographic master and known machines. The said holographic film is then coated with suitable pressure sensitive adhesive on the non aluminised (metallised)side of the film using known method and dried online using drying tunnel and laminated to release liner such as silicone paper or siliconised film; alternatively a dried acrylic or rubber based adhesive lamina coated separately using similar method and machine generally referred as "transfer adhesive tape" can be applied to the non aluminised (metallised) side of this film. The adhesive coated film is then slit to desired size and printed from the metallised side using transparent inks such as regular inks, invisible inks which are either not readable under normal light and can be read under ultra-violet or infra red radiations of specified range or having characteristics that show one color with normal light but show different colour when viewed under ultraviolet radiation. The said printed adhesive coated film thus produced is then cut to desired shape and size by using known method to get the label. The label thus produced acts as an authentication security label in a manner that when specific chemical as described above is applied on the top<br><br><br>
metallised side of the label the non printed portion of the metallised layer dissolves and disappears leaving behind the hidden matter printed using invisible inks and/or ultra violet or infra red radiation readable inks thereby providing the evidence of genuineness of the label.<br>
In another of the preferred embodiment (Figure 2) one side aluminium coated (metallised) polymeric film is embossed on the metallised side using holographic master and known machines. The said holographic film is then coated with suitable pressure sensitive adhesive on the non aluminised (metallised) side of the film using known method and dried online using drying tunnel and laminated to release liner such as silicone paper or siliconised film; alternatively a dried acrylic or rubber based adhesive lamina coated separately using similar method and machine generally referred as "transfer adhesive tape" can be applied to the non aluminised side of this film. The adhesive coated film is then slit to desired size and shape by using known method to get the label. The said label then can be used as such as an authentication label by applying the said label on any matter, number, etc. printed or engraved on any object, article, packaging, certificate, document, part or entire surface of another labels etc. The label thus produced acts as an authentication security label in a manner that when specific chemical as described above is applied on the top metallised side of the label the entire metallised layer dissolves and disappears thereby exposing the hidden matter originally printed on any object, article, packaging, certificate, document, part or entire surface of another label etc. on which the said label was applied thereby providing the evidence of equinity of the object, article, packaging, document etc.<br><br><br>
In yet another of the preferred embodiment (Figure 3) one side aluminium coated (metallised) polymeric film is embossed on the metallised side using holographic master and known machines. The said holographic film is then printed on the non metallised surface of the polymeric film using normal inks such as regular inks, invisible inks which are either not readable under normal light and can be read under ultra-violet or infra red radiations of specified range or having characteristics that shows one colour with normal light but shows different colour when viewed under ultraviolet radiation. Such printing is done by known methods of printing in a manner by which the matter appearing on the non metallised side at the time of printing is the mirror image of the actual matter. The said holographic film is then coated with suitable pressure sensitive adhesive on the printed non aluminised (metallised) side of the film using known method and dried online using drying tunnel and laminated to release liner such as silicone paper or siliconised film; alternatively a dried acrylic or rubber based adhesive lamina coated separately using similar method and machine generally referred as "transfer adhesive tape" can be applied to the printed non aluminised (metallised) side of this film. The adhesive coated film is then slit to desired size and shape by using known method to get the label. The label thus produced acts as an authentication security label in a manner that when specific chemical as described above is applied on the top metallised side of the label the entire metallised layer dissolves and disappears thereby exposing the hidden matter printed on non metallised surface of the label which can then be read under normal light and/or can be read when exposed to ultra violet and/or infra red radiations of specific intensity thereby providing the evidence of genuineness of the label.<br><br><br>
In yet another possible embodiment of this invention (Figure 4) involves aluminium coating (metallising) done by vacuum coating technique, using known methods in two separate steps on either sides of polymeric film. This aluminium-coated film is then embossed with (a) reverse image (so as to be readable from top) on one side and (b) another holographic normal image on second side of metallised film using holographic masters and known method. The said film is then coated on reverse holographic image side with pressure sensitive adhesive using known method and dried online using drying tunnel; and laminating with suitable release liner such as silicone paper or siliconised film, alternatively, a dried acrylic or rubber based adhesive lamina coated separately using similar method and machine referred as "transfer adhesive tape" can be applied to reverse holographic side of the film. The above adhesive coated film is then slit to desired size and printed from the readable holographic image side using regular printing inks. The label thus produced acts as an authentication security label in a manner that when specific chemical as described above is applied on the top metallised side of the label the entire metallised layer dissolves and disappears thereby exposing the second holographic image which was otherwise hidden thereby providing the evidence of genuineness of the label.<br>
