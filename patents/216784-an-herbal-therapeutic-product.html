DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an herbal therapeutic product controlling diabetes mellitus comprising at least one hypoglycemic compound extracted from the pulp of a species of the genus Eugenia, specifically Eugenia jambolina.<br>
The process for the preparation of such herbal product comprising cleaning and drying the fruit of a species of genus Eugenia of family Myrtaceae to remove the extraneous material from the outer layer of the said fruit, deseeding the said fruit, soaking the de-seeded pulp in water, mixing the said mixture of water and pulp and keeping it overnight in a controlled cooled conditions to maintain the activity of hypoglycemic compounds, filtering the<br><br>
said mixture by conventional manner, washing the residue with water to extract all the active compounds from the said mixture of water and pulp in the form of clear watery solution, reducing the water content by keeping the said clear watery solution in controlled freezing conditions by conventional means to get the residues in concentrated form, purifying the said concentrated product in a chromatography by using slurries of different columns, adding buffers in the said purified mixture present in the said chromatography to elute the mixture of hypoglycemic compounds<br>
The various steps involved in the aforementioned process are :<br>
(a)	The fruit of Eugenia jambolina is cleaned and dried to remove the<br>
extraneous material from the outer layer of the said fruit;<br>
(b)	the seed is removed from the said fruit by conventional manner and is<br>
kept separately.<br>
(c)	the de-seeded pulp is soaked in (distilled) water and the same is mixed<br>
to get a uniform consistency of the liquid ;<br>
,(d) the said mixture is kept overnight in a controlled cooled conditions preferably between 4-10 degrees centigrade;<br>
(e)	the said mixture is filtered by conventional manner<br>
(f)	the residue are washed with water to extract all the active compounds<br>
from the said pulp in the form of clear watery solution<br>
(g)	the water    content are reduced by keeping the said clear watery<br>
solution in freezing conditions by conventional means to get the residues in<br>
concentrated form;<br><br>
(h) the said concentrated product is purified by treating the same with slurries of solvents selected preferably from sephadex, diethyl amino ethyl cellulose, anion exchange resins or silica gel and distilled water in the chromatography;<br>
(i) buffers are added in the said purified mixture present in the chromatography to elute the hypoglycemic compounds from the said mixture.<br>
The water content from said mixture can be reduced optionally to get the end product in solid form . The water is extracted from the said mixture after the stage of filtration by means of lypholizer.<br>
The said pulp of Eugenia jambolina, is subjected to column chromatography for a period of 15 minutes -2 hours to obtain a hypoglycemic fraction at a slightly acidic pH of 5-7 preferably 6.0 to 6.5.<br>
The said hypoglycemic fraction is subjected to thin layer chromatography using silica gel to form at least 2 visible bands . The Rf value of all the four bands is between 0.1-1.0, wherein the Rf value of one visible band which is having highly active hypoglycemic compound is between 0.5 to 0.7 and the Rf value of less active hypoglycemic compounds is between 0.1-0.2 and 0.9-1.0.<br>
The pH of the column containing mixture of chemical compounds is maintained at pH of 6.0-8.0 preferably 6.5 to 7.5.<br>
The said buffer used in the chromatography is selected preferably from the phosphate buffer, citrate buffer or TRIS buffer.<br>
The pH of the said mixture of hypoglycemic compounds is to be maintained neutral.<br><br>
The said mixture of hypoglycemic compounds were further analyzed to .separate the active hypoglycemic compounds by means of thin layer chromatography to separate the different compounds in the form of separate bands. Such bands were further exposed to the iodine chamber for the clear demarcation of the individual compound. It has been found that out of 4 such hypoglycemic compounds present in the mixture, two compounds are having immediate effect in controlling and maintaining the blood sugar level , while other two hypoglycemic compounds have their effect after certain time.<br>
In the thin layer chromatography, the said mixture of hypoglycemic compounds are dropped in the lower most end of a silica gel coated plate to get the deposition of said hypoglycemic compounds in the form of bands on the said silica gel coated plate by running with a mixture of solvents for 2-3 hours in the ascending manner. The said solvents are n-butanol, acetic acid and water in the ratio of 5:1:4. The silica gel coated plate with bands of hypoglycemic compounds is dried in cooled conditions and is exposed to iodine chamber to get the clear demarcation of the different hypoglycemic compounds bands which are extracted from the silica gel coated plate along with the fractions of silica gel. The extracted hypoglycemic compound along with silica gel is mixed with water for the separation of said silica gel by centrifugation.<br>
The water used in the subject process is preferably distilled water.<br>
A study was conducted to determine the effect of a herbal therapeutic product prepared from the pulp extracted from the genus Eugenia on the blood glucose, liver, aorta, pancreas and heart. The results were found very effective with no side effects which is the main embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Various tests were conducted to analyze the effect of said product on testing the blood glucose level in fasting and in glucose tolerance test.<br><br>
The test was conducted on alloxan induced diabetic rabbit where the said product prepared from the process of subject invention was given to alloxan induced diabetic rabbit after drawing the blood from fasting rabbits. After giving the dose of said product, the blood was withdrawn again from said rabbit after 90 minutes. After that 2 grams of glucose in a water solution was given to that rabbit. The blood was again withdrawn after two hours of glucose feed. It was found that said mixture reduced the blood glucose level even after the glucose feed, which was due to the rise in insulin level in the blood.<br>
The said product was found to increase the activity of enzymes in liver, muscle and adipose tissue, which use glucose and thereby reduces blood glucose level. The said product was further found to reduce the level of lipids in blood which are responsible for heart diseases like total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. At the same time it increases the level of favourable lipids for health such as high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). The said mixture of hypoglycemic compounds were found to be having no adverse effects on the liver and kidney functions.<br>
No abnormalities were found after conducting the histopathology of liver, aorta, pancreas and heart, when the patient was treated with the product of subject invention.<br>
Hence, the subject invention relates to a herbal therapeutic product to control the glucose level in diabetes mellitus and also minimizes the risk of heart diseases extracted from the pulp of a species from the genus Eugenia prepared from the process as herein before described, comprising said hypoglycemic compound or a group of said hypoglycemic compounds in the form of a product.<br><br>
