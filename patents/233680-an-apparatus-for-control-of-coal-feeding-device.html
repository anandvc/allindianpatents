				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates an improved apparatus for on line computation and<br>
control of a coal feeding device during its feeding raw coal to pulverizers in coal-<br>
tired boilers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coal fired boilers are employed world wide by thermal power plants and many<br>
other industries which require steam and / or power for its operation. The coal<br>
from a bulk storage is fed to a pulverizer through a coal feeding device. The coal<br>
feeding device weigh the raw coal passing through a conveyor belt, adjust the<br>
quantum of coal fed to the pulverizer in proportion to demand of the system and<br>
compute the amount of coal fed to the pulverizer over a period of time. It is<br>
essential to maintain the weighing accuracy of the feeding device on a long-term<br>
basis. To achieve this, re-calibration of the coal feeding device is required to be<br>
done under the following conditions:<br>
•	When any of the components in weighing system / speed measuring<br>
circuit is changed.<br>
•	At regular intervals of around six months to take care of weighing system<br>
components wear and tear.<br><br>
In the presently available hardwired electronic (solid state) control, more than<br>
nine varieties of electronic modules (Electronic cards) are used to perform weight<br>
sensing, speed measuring, rate multiplying computation, belt speed and logic<br>
control functions. These modules are mounted in the card racks - one number,<br>
rack fixed inside remote power cabinet and another mounted in the feeder<br>
integral cabinet.<br>
During calibration of feeders under the conditions described above, the<br>
potentiometers located in the field mounted modules need to be adjusted to<br>
arrive at the calibration accuracy. Repeated adjustment of the potentiometers<br>
are required on trial basis, to achieve the accepted level of accuracy. Hence the<br>
calibration process takes more time (approximately one hour). Also the output of<br>
the potentiometers drift after few months of continuous operation due to feeder<br>
vibration etc., which ultimately affect the weighting accuracy.<br>
United States Patent no. 5,784,974 titled "System for improving fuel feed control<br>
of volumetric coal feeders" discloses a feeder system for measuring and<br>
controlling the massed feed rate of particulate fuel material, such as coal<br>
particles, made up of a group of volumetric feeders and a gravimetric feeder<br>
coupled to the group of volumetric feeders. The system controls the fuel feed<br>
rata of the volumetric feeders based upon data communicated from the<br>
gravimetric feeder.<br>
The reference in gist discloses a method of controlling a group of volumetric<br>
feeders with a gravimetric feeder coupled to it. The invented design pertains to<br>
an apparatus for controlling the feed rate of only an individual coal feeding<br>
device.<br><br>
United States Patent no. 4,582,026 titled "Feed-forward type automatic control<br>
system" describes an automatic anticipatory control system for controlling, by<br>
one common control quantity, a plurality of points of operation that can be<br>
changed over individually and arbitrarily between start and stop operations and<br>
between an automatic operation mode and a manual operation mode. In gist,<br>
the disclosure relates to an apparatus for controlling the feed rate of only one<br>
coal feeding device.<br>
Thus, the major disadvantages of the prior art constitute repeated adjustment of<br>
the potentiometers leading to delay and inaccuracy in measurement.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the invention to provide an improved apparatus for<br>
controlling a coal feeding device in a steam generation system.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved apparatus for<br>
controlling a coal feeding device in a steam generation system having automatic<br>
calibration facility and does not require any manual settings or adjustments in<br>
the Electronic Hardware.<br>
A further object of the Invention is to provide an improved apparatus controlling<br>
a coal feeding device in a steam generation system which has self-diagnostic<br>
features to guide the operator for easy troubleshooting.<br><br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide an improved apparatus<br>
controlling a coal feeding device in a steam generation system which is capable<br>
of establishing compatible interfaces for integration with other controllers and<br>
control means of the generation system.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved apparatus for<br>
controlling a coal feeding device in a steam generation system which is capable<br>
of easy maintenance and user friendly.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 - Shows a schematic diagram of the improved apparatus according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The improved apparatus comprises a Remote control panel, a Local Control Panel<br>
and associated interconnecting cables.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 1, the Remote control panei (1) consists of card racks (3)<br>
which comprise the microprocessor / microcontroller module, power supply and<br>
motor speed control module and other interface electronic modules. The card<br>
rack is wired with various system components. A Man-Machine Interface (2) is<br>
mounted on the door of the Remote Control Panel. The Local Control Panel (4) is<br>
mounted on the coal feeding device, and houses a signal conditioning module<br>
(5). Weighing modules (6) are used to weigh the coai passing through a fixed<br>
length of the conveyor belt. The coal feeding device has a drive means which<br>
consists of an AC induction motor (9), eddy current clutch (10) and gear<br>
reducers (11) to drive a conveyor belt. The interconnections between the<br>
Remote Control Panel (1) and the Local Control Panel (4) are made by special<br>
screened cable (8) to facilitate signal transfer. To perform calibration of the<br>
feeding device, two numbers of calibration probes (7) are hooked up to the<br>
signal conditioning module (5) whenever required. The calibration is done by<br>
attaching test weights to the coal feeding device.<br>
The improved apparatus maintains the feed rate accurately as per fuel demand<br>
signal from the combustion control means by regulating the current to the coil of<br>
the clutch means (10). The regulation of the current to the clutch coil controls<br>
the speed of the belt conveyor through gear reducers (11). In order to regulate<br>
the clutch coil current, the microprocessor / microcontroller estimates the<br>
required motor speed set point. To determine the actual federate, computation is<br>
carried out. The computation comprises a calculation of the federate by utilizing<br>
the speed factor and weight factor previously obtained during the calibration<br>
process. The actual feed rate is compared with the fuel demand feed rate to<br>
determine the motor speed set point.<br><br>
The man-Machine Interface (2) unit provided on the door of the Remote Control<br>
Panel (1) communicates the data to the microprocessor / microcontroller module<br>
mounted in the card rack (3) in the Remote Control Panel. Membrane type<br>
keyboard provided as part of Man-Machine Interface, is especially configured to<br>
meet the operational requirement of the feeding device.<br>
The Remote Control Panel (1) mounted microprocessor / microcontroller has<br>
provisions for automatic calibration of coal feeding device, thus eliminating time<br>
consuming, trial and error potentiometer method of calibration. The Man-<br>
Machine Interface is extremely user friendly including self-prompting instructions<br>
and messages. The face of the interface has a sealed membrane with a full-<br>
function keyboard. Further the interface also provides event recording, self test<br>
and diagnostic features for quick trouble shooting and reducing down time of the<br>
equipment.<br>
The microprocessor / microcontroller module further provides direct interface<br>
with Distributed Control System (DCS) through serial communication ports,<br>
configurable to RS232C or RS485. It also includes total password security for the<br>
protection of calibration constants and capacity reprogramming parameters.<br>
The microprocessor / microcontroller module can be located up to 750 m away<br>
from the coal feeding device.<br>
The apparatus can also be used to handle continuous bulk movement of<br>
minerals ores anrirhomirak fnnrlch iffc anA a uariof-u n( nfj-iar&gt; m»f«■&gt;;*(«•<br>
process. The actual feed rate is compared with the fuel demand feed rate to<br>
determine the motor speed set point.<br><br>
The microprocessor / microcontroller module is located in a modular type panel<br>
for better aesthetics.<br>
The apparatus is user friendly such that calibration / re-calibration can be done<br>
by data entry through a alpha-numeric display device (located in a panel,<br>
mounted away from the raw coal feeding device) and without potentiometers<br>
adjustment.<br><br>
