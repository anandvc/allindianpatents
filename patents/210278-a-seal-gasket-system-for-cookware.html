BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to cookware gasket. More especially this invention relates to novel gasket for domestic cookware. There are many varieties of the gaskets available in the market. The art of using gasket for domestic cookware Is yet unknown in the market.<br>
This invention relates to a system that provides a Soft Seal between the top of any cookware and the edge of its lid. This system can be used for the sealing-in of vapours and steam generated in various vessels such as, but not limited to, domestic cookware including the category commonly known as non-stick cookware. This is a complete gasket system which is made to match and mate with the edge of any lid made of any appropriate materials like glass, metal or plastic on the one hand and having a soft skirt on the lower portion that fits inner top edge of the cookware matching the lid on the other hand.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The disadvantage of the existing lids is that they have a rigid edge. Even when they have a vertical lip fitting inside the top of the cookware this lip is not in complete juxtaposition with the inner surface of the cookware. Because of this, during use the vapours or steam generated inside the vessel do not get sealed. The hot vapours tend to escape randomly around the edge of the vessel. Further such a rigid lid damages the inner nonstick surface when used in conjunction with nonstick cookware.<br>
Another disadvantage with existing cookware systems is that during normal use or inadvertently by being dropped from the hand the edge of the lid tends to develop nicks or other distortions, which aggravates the initial poor sealing.<br><br>
A further disadvantage is that in case of lids made of glass, ceramic or other brittle material any accidental knock or fall tends to break the lid, sometimes in a hazardous manner. In the interest of easy handling and less breakage of cookware lid during handling, the preferred embodiment provides for gasket shape and size such that the gasket act as a shock absorber to the lid during a fall.<br>
0B3ECT      OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to contrive a novel gasket to be used in domestic cookware. Consequence of this is that when used in cookwares, the rigid material does not adjust to imperfect edges and profile of the lids and the containers. This results in gaps in certain parts resulting in escape of vapour from the cookware at all such open spots. At certain spots, there will be pressure on the lid to fit into the profile of the cookware. The portion of the lids thus pressed additionally will cause damage to the lid and the cookware.<br>
The invention consisting of a soft seal gasket system obviates these disadvantages in addition to providing some extra advantages. It takes care of the profile of the lid and container. The concept of the system is such that it is adaptable to all manner of lids made of a variety of materials like glass,ceramic, metal or plastic or a comibanation of these. It is adaptable to all manner of shapes of the lid such as round, square or any other shape. Hence the container, lid and gasket are capable of being used without causing undue damage to all three components and sealing in the vapours within the cookware.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Existing systems have a rigid lip seal.  The present invention has soft seal t)etween the top of cookware and edge of its lid.<br><br>
Therefore it is the object of the invention to invent a gasket which can t)e used in a domestic cookware more specifically, without any damage to the cookware or the gasket and obtaining the maximum efficiency for sealing in vapours during cooking.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel gasket which is sturdy in construction and efficient in use with a domestic cookware.<br>
It is another object of the invention to construct a gasket, which is safe to use with a<br>
cookware.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, the enhanced efficiency and safety factor originates from the composition and shape of the gasket, which has been developed by the inventors,<br>
A gasket as per the invention comprises of soft shape with a profile designed to mate with the edge of the lid with top groove designed to accommodate onto the edge of the lid and the lower skirt designed to accommodate on to the edge of the lid and the lower skirt designed to accommodate into the inner periphery of the top of the vessel. The gasket as per invention is now described herein below in its broadest scopes and aspect and the possible variant features and characteristics of the invention are described along with equivalent features and characteristics in the preferred embodiment.<br><br>
The preferred embodiment is described herein below: -<br>
The gasket as per invention comprises of a body (1) having the upper edge (2) with groove (3) specifically designed. By virtue of the groove the gasket gets accommodated on to the edge of the lid. There is a skirt provided (4) at the lower edge. (5) By nature of the skirting, the gasket accommodates on to the inner periphery of the top of the vessel. The novel gasket has a unique composition, and construction, which is shown in Fig.2. Of the drawings. The gasket runs along the edge of the lid and coincides with the edge of the lid and the top of the container.<br>
The lower skirting matches the profile of the cookware container. This gasket is to be fixed manually within what cavity of the lid so provided, just prior to the use of the domestic cookware.<br>
The said use of the gasket in said cookware is a novel development.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the preferred embodiment, which is more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein. However, the scope of the      invention       is      not      limited       by      said      preferred      embodiment.<br>
Figure 1. Depicts the general cross-sectional view of the system.<br>
Figure 2.   Depicts a close up of the cross section of an exemplary gasket designed for one   specific   type   of   lid.   The   same   concepts   are   applicable   to   other   lids.<br><br>
The material of the gasket is any material like, but not limited to, nitrite rubber, silicon rubber, thermoplastic elastomers or other material approved for such purpose by Indian or other National or International Standards. The crucial parts are the top groove designed to fit snugly on the edge of the lid and the skirt designed to fit around ttie inner periphery of the top of the vessel.<br>
Figure 2 shows the details of the cross section of the exemplary gasket system generally depicted in Figure 1.<br>
The actual dimensions of the various parts of the profile of the system described here and depicted in the figures are designed to have appropriate values to achieve the specified performance in combination with the lid and the vessel for which the system is specifically designed.<br>
Now, the invention has been described to the best of our ability and knowledge and any modification variation, deviation made would come within the purview of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>
1. A soft seal gasket system for cookware essentially consisting of an appropriately shaped soft gasket made of an elastomer or polymer or a combination of them with or without other admixtures for providing a seal between a vessel and its lid, such as domestic cookware for providing a seal and controlling the leak of steam or vapours generated within the cookware during cooking.<br><br>
The gaskel system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lid is made of materials, like glass metal plastic or ceramic or a combination of these.<br>
The gasket system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the body of cookware is made of metal like Aluminium, stainless steel with or with out a non-stick coating to the<br>
metal.<br>
The gasket system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the shape of the containers and lid is round, square rectangular or oval.<br>
The gasket system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the materials for making the gasket is nitrite rubber, silicon rubber and thermoplastic elastomers, or a combination of these.<br>
The gasket as claimed in claim 1, wherein the gasket is so designed to have a top groove, such that it fits onto the edge of the lid of the cookware.<br>
The gasket system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the gasket is so designed to have a soft skirt on the lower portion, that fits correspondingly into the inner periphery of the top of the vessel.<br><br>
8.        The gasket system as claimed in claim 1-6, substantially as herein described and explained with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
