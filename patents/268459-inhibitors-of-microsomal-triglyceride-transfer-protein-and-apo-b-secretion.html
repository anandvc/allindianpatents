CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application nos. 60/672,778, filed April 19,2005, and 60/755,390, filed December 30, 2005. The contents of each of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compotmds which are inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and/or apolipoproteia B (Apo B) secretion. These compotmds can be useful for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae, for lowering serum lipids, and related ailments. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and to methods of treating diseases, such as hypertriglyceridemia, hyperchylomicronemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, and related conditions using the compounds. A method for decreasing apoHpoproteia B (apo B) secretion is also provided.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION J/ficrosomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes the transport of triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and phosphoUpids, MTP has been identified as an agent that may be involved in the assembly of Apo B-containing lipoproteins and biomolecules that contribute to the formation of atherosclCTotic lesions. Compounds that can inhibit MTP and/or inhibit Apo B secretion can be useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis and related diseases (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,919,795, incorporated herein by reference). These compounds are also useful in the treating diseases or conditions in which, by inhibiting MTP and/or Apo B secretion, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels are reduced. Examples of tbese diseases or conditions include hypertriglyceridania, hypercholesterolemia, pancreatits, and obesity; and hyperchylomicronemia and hyperhpidemla associated with pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes.<br>
Therefore, th^e is a need for compounds that inhibit MTP that are effective in treating diseases or conditions, such as atherosclerosis and related diseases, and/or can provide an effective lowering of serum apo B in mammals or humans.<br><br>

(e.g., the dihydrogeai phosphate, the citrate), at least one molar equivalent and usually a molar excess of the acid is employed. However, w:hen such salts as the sulfate, the hemisuccinate, the hydrogKi phosphate or the phosphate are desired, the appropriate and exact chemical equivalents of acid will generally be used. The free base and the acid axe usually combined in a co-solveot from which the desired salt precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and/or addition of a non-solvent<br>

The MTP inhibitors of the invention exhibit selective inhibition activity towards HepG2-ApoBl that is associated with the VLDL lipoproteins secreted by the intestine while remaining<br><br>
inert towards HepG2-ApoAl, which is related-to HDL (Table 1). One desired characteristic of a compound is the combination of permeability as shown in the Caco-2 peimeability assay and cellular activity as shown in the HepG2 and Caco-2 ApoB assays. These assays indicate that the compounds of the invrntion exhibit selective permeability. Such selective permeability may result in these compounds having the ability to permeate the intestinal membrane, but not cross it, which is expected to minimize side effects. The MTP inhibitor conq&gt;ounds of the iQvention are expected to exhibit selective activity in the intestine without exhibiting undesirable systemic exposure, when administered orally.<br>
