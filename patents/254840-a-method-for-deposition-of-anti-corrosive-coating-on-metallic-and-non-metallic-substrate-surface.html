				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a method for despositing anti-corrosive coating on<br>
metallic and non-metallic substrate surfaces. This invention further relates to a<br>
method for depositing Ni based pore free anti-corrosive coating of Group VA<br>
metals on metallic and non-metallic surfaces, by ion-exchange auto catalytic<br>
process. The deposit is hard enough to withstand salty, acidic, alkaline and<br>
corrosive gaseous environment. The coating provided has utilization in various<br>
industries like, Motor industries, aerospace industries, Chemical industries,<br>
Electronics industries, Food processing industries and Textile industries.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Oil and gas are explored from remote rural and unmanned areas. The metallic<br>
items like valves, exhaust stacks, pipe castings and conveyor components are<br>
used in oil and gas lifting as well as transporting them to the refineries. These<br>
items are made of metals and non-metals and are of complex shapes and sizes.<br>
They are mainly made of steel with various percentage of carbon that are<br>
affected in salty and acidic environment. The oil and gas environment is<br>
composed of corrosive gases like CO2, H2S. Dissolving these gases in water from<br>
an acidic environment and corrode the above items. As a result the lifetime of<br>
the above items are limited in the oil and gaseous atmosphere. The items<br>
mentioned above are placed at very remote locations like in the bed of sea, in<br>
desert etc. Damage, due to corrosion causes not only a big loss in terms of<br>
spillage of oil and gas and consequently financial loss but also renders the<br>
components vulnerable to environment.<br>
The difficulties of protecting substrate surface from corrosion particularly in oil<br>
and gas environment are known in the art. Therefore, the need exists, to protect<br>
the components to ensure proper functioning on a long term basis.<br><br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose a method for depositing an<br>
anti-corrosive coating on metallic and non-metallic surfaces, which is simple and<br>
cost effective.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose a method for depositing an anti-<br>
corrosive coating on metallic and non-metallic surfaces, which employs easily<br>
available raw materials and apparatus.<br>
These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing<br>
description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
This invention will be explained in greater detail with the help of the<br>
accompanying drawings where<br>
1.	Figure 1 is the diagram for testing the coating in salty environment.<br>
2.	Figure 2 is the corrosion characteristics of coating in salty<br>
environment.<br>
3.	Figure 3 is the diagram for testing coating in corrosive gas<br>
environment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a method for depositing an anti-<br>
corrosive coating on metallic and non-metallic surfaces.<br><br><br>
According to this invention further provided a solution composition for deposition<br>
of NixPy coating at various x and y values.<br>
Ni - stands for Nickel<br>
P - stands for Phosphorous<br>
x and y are the percentage of metal and non-metal embedded in the coating.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the coating is deposited from solution by an<br>
ion-exchange auto-catalytic process, without the passage of electricity. In<br>
general, the method involves the preparation of a chemical solution for<br>
electroless bath and surface treatment of metallic substrates like mild steel, cast<br>
iron etc. for deposition of NixPy. For deposition of NixPy using electroless<br>
technique a special type of solution bath is prepared. The solution consists of<br>
salts of Ni like NiCl2, NiSO4 or NiCO3 or combinations thereof, a reducing agent<br>
like Na2HPO2, a complexing agent such as sodium succinate and a stabilizer such<br>
as lead acetate Nickel chloride is used in a proportion of 60 to 220 gms per litre,<br>
nickel sulphate in 60 to 200 gms/litre and nickel carbonate in 50 to 190 gms per<br>
litre of water. The reducing agent sodium hypophosphite is present in 5.5 to 35.5<br>
gms/litre. The complexing agent and stabilizing agents are present in trace<br>
quantities of about 100 mg/litre of water. The above chemicals are mixed in<br>
particular proportion to have the exact solution strength. The solution is then<br>
warmed up to a temperature of 90-95°C. Metallic items of the above categories<br>
are treated in two other solutions. These are sensitizer and activator. The<br>
sensitizer solution is a mixture a tin salt such as for e.g. SnCl2 and an acid such<br>
as for example HCI. Tin chloride is present in 5 to 15 gms per litre of water and<br>
hydrochloric acid in 5 to 15 ml/litre of water. On the other hand the activator<br>
solution is a mixture of salt like PdCI2 and an acid with HCI. Palladium chloride is<br><br>
used in 300 to 500 mg/litre of water and hydrochloric acid in 5 to 15 ml/litre of<br>
water. Before deposition of NixPy layer the substrate surface is treated with<br>
sensitizer and activator solutions. The substrate is then put in the plating solution<br>
for the deposition of NixPy layer. Multi -layered coating are provided to make it<br>
pore free. Total thickness of the coating can range upto 20 µrn.<br>
The substrates are cleaned in cleaning solution to remove contaminations like<br>
grease and rust. The substrates are then treated in sensitizer solution to<br>
sensitize the substrate surface. After sensitization the substrate is activated in<br>
activator solution. After activation the substrates dipped in plating bath to<br>
deposit NixPy coating. Deposition was allowed for 7-10 mins. to have good<br>
coating.<br>
The substrates are then annealed in air at a temperature more than 250°C. The<br>
annealing enhances the contacting performance.<br>
According to the present method solution preparation is different from<br>
commercial solutions due to the incorporation of chemical at various percentage.<br>
The plating is conducted at a particular optimized condition and as a result exact<br>
percentage of P can be incorporated. The percentage of phosphorus control the<br>
corrosion resistance.<br>
The above coating was deposited from the ion exchanged autocatalytic process<br>
for the solution. As no electricity is involved in this coating process it is termed as<br>
electroless plating technique.<br>
The coating developed using the above technique has the following characteristic<br>
features:<br><br><br>
•	The reduction of metallic ions occur in presence of Hypophosphite at the<br>
substrate surface, chiefly belonging to the eighth group of periodic table,<br>
which are capable of catalyzing the process;<br>
•	The rate of deposition is greatly influenced by the temperature of the<br>
solution and is governed by exponential law;<br>
•	The rate of reduction of metallic ions is strongly influenced by the pH<br>
value of the solution;<br>
•	The deposit obtained from such solution is not a pure metallic one but<br>
always contains come percentage of phosphorous, a component of the<br>
reductant, the amount of which depends on the operating conditions and<br>
particularly the pH level of the solution;<br>
•	The deposition of metallic ions takes place with the evolution of hydrogen.<br>
Thus, the invention also provides a solution composition of solution for<br>
deposition of NixPy coating at various of x and y as desired for.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater details with the help of the<br>
following non limiting examples.<br>
Example 1:<br>
An electrolysis bath is prepared by dissolving 200 gms nickel chloride 20.5 gms<br>
of sodium hypophosphite, in a litre of water and warming the solution to 92°C.<br>
A sensitizer solution is prepared by dissolving 10 g of tin chloride and 10 ml<br>
hydrochlorine acid in a litre of water and an activator solution is prepared by<br>
dissolving 400 mg palladium chloride and 10 ml hydrochloric acid in a litre of<br>
water.<br><br><br>
The substrate is treated with a standard cleaning solution to remove grease and<br>
rust and then treated with the sensitizer solution for sensitization, followed by<br>
the activator solution. The activated substrate is then dipped in the electrolysis<br>
bath and deposition is allowed for approximately 6 min for a good coating. The<br>
substrates are then annealed in air at above 250°C to obtain the coated<br>
substrates.<br>
Example 2<br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using 183gms of nickel<br>
sulphate salt instead of nickel chloride in the electrolysis bath.<br>
Example 3<br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using 165gms nickel carbonate<br>
salt.<br>
Example 4<br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using a mixture of 100 gms<br>
nickel chloride and 92 gms Nickel sulphate in the electrolysis bath.<br>
Example 5<br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using a mixture of 92 gms<br>
nickel sulphate and 83 gms nickel carbonate in the electrolysis bath.<br>
Example 6<br><br><br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using a mixture of 100 gms<br>
nickel chloride and 83 gms nickel carbonate in the electrolysis bath.<br>
Example 7<br>
The same procedure as for Example 1 is followed using a mixture of 67 gms<br>
nickel chloride, 61 gms nickel sulphate and 55 gms nickel carbonate in the<br>
electrolysis bath.<br>
The substrates coated according to the invention are tested for their properties<br>
and Figure 1 shows the set up and methodology employed for testing in salty<br>
environment. The corrosion characteristic in salty environment is presented in<br>
Figure 2. Figure 2 indicates that corrosion rate is very low and expected coating<br>
life is very high. In Figure 3 a testing arrangement for corrosion resistance of<br>
coating in gas environment is shown. The corrosion resistance characteristics in<br>
gaseous environment is depicted in Figure 4.<br><br>
