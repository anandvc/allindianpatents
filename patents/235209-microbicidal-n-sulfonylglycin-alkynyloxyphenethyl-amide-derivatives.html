presence of an acid-binding agent and if desired in the presence of a diluent, with an amine of the general formula XII.<br>
Suitable carboxy-activated derivatives of the amino acid of fomnula XIII include any carboxy-activated derivatives, such as acid halides, for example acid chlorides; also symmetrical or mixed anhydrides, for example the mixed O-alkylcariaoxylic acid anhydrides; and also activated esters, for example p-nitrophenyl esters or N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, and activated forms of the amino acid produced in situ using condensing agents, e.g. dicyclo-hexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, 0-(benzotriazol-1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-bis(penta-methylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, 0-(benzotriazol-1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-bis(tetra-methylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, (benzotriazol-1 -yloxy)-tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate, (benzotriazol-1 -yloxy)-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluoro¬phosphate or 0-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate.<br>
The mixed anhydrides corresponding to the amino acid of formula XIII can be prepared by reacting the amino acid of formula XIII with a chloroformic acid ester, for example a chloro-formic acid alkyl ester, preferably isobutyl chloroformate, if desired in the presence of an acid-binding agent, such as an inorganic or organic base, for example a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylpiperidine or N-methylmorpholine.<br>
The reaction of the amino acid of formula XIII, or of a carboxy-activated derivative of the amino acid of formula XIII, with an amine of formula XII is carried out in an inert diluent, such as an aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbon, for example a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride or toluene; a ketone, e.g. acetone; an ester, e.g. ethyl acetate; an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide; a nitrile, e.g. acetonitrile; or an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether or tert-butyl methyl ether; or in a mixture of those inert diluents, if desired in the presence of an acid-binding agent, e.g. an inorganic or organic base, for example a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylpiperidine or N-methylmorpholine, at temperatures of from -80 to +150°C, preferably from -40 to +40°C.<br>
In a second step, a compound of formula XIV is reacted with a compound of formula V.<br><br>
The reaction of a compound of fonnula XIV with a compound of formula V is carried out in an inert diluent. The following may be mentioned as examples: aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons, for example toluene or methylene chloride; ketones, for example acetone; esters, for example ethyl acetate; amides, for example dimethylform-amide; nitriles, for example acetonitrile; ethers, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether or tert-butyl methyl ether; alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, n-butanol, isopropanol or tert-butanol; dimethyl sulfoxide; or water; or mixtures of those inert diluents. The reaction of a compound of formula XIV with a compound of formula V is carried out if desired in the presence of an acid-binding agent. Suitable acid-binding agents include inorganic or organic bases, for example alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alcoholates or carbonates, e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium metha-nolate, potassium methanolate, sodium ethanolate, potassium ethanolate, sodium tert-butanolate, potassium tert-butanolate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. The temperatures are from -80 to +200°C, preferably from 0 to +120°C; or the reaction is carried out as described under Process c).<br>
In a third step, compounds of formula XV are subjected to acid hydrolysis. The reaction of a compound of formula XV with an inorganic or organic acid, for example a mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or a carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or a sulfonic acid, e.g. methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, is carried out if desired in an inert diluent, such as an aromatic, non-aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbon, for example a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. methylene chloride or toluene; a ketone, e.g. acetone; an ester, e.g. ethyl acetate; an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dioxane; or water, at temperatures of from -40 to +150°C. If desired, it is also possible to use mixtures of different acids and of different inert diluents, or the acid itself may serve as the diluent.<br>
The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbicidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related fields preventively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concen¬tration not only by outstanding microbicidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous biocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic micro¬organisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agri¬cultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distin¬guished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and black¬berries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-<br><br>
taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such ais tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>

Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth.

Such carriers and additives are described, for example, in WO 95/30651.<br>
A preferred method of applying a compound of formula I, or an agrochemical composition comprising at least one of those compounds, is application to the foliage (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application depending upon the risk of infestation by the pathogen in question. The compounds of formula I may also be applied to seed grains (coating) either by impregnating the grains with a liquid formulation of the active ingredient or by coating them with a solid formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula I are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are for that purpose advantageously formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the<br><br>
nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering, coating or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended object¬ives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
Advantageous rates of application are normally from 1 g to 2 kg of active ingredient (a.i.) per hectare (ha), preferably from 10 g to 1 kg a.i./ha, especially from 25 g to 750 g a.iVha. When used as seed dressings, rales of from 0.001 g to 1.0 g of active ingredient per kg of seed are advantageously used.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the com-pound(s) (active ingredient(s)) of formula I and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Further surfactants customarily used in formulation technology will be known to the person skilled in the art or can be found in the relevant technical literature.<br>
The agrochemical compositions usually comprise 0.01 to 99 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula I, 99.99 to 1 % by weight, preferably 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, and 0 to 25 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant.<br>

infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 %<br>
relative humidity and 20°C.<br><br>
b) Systemic action<br>
2-3 week old potato plants (Bintje variety) are watered with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient based on the volume of the soil) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. Care is taken that the spray mixture does not come into contact with the parts of the plants that are above the ground. After 48 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and 20°C. Infestation is prevented virtually completely (0 to 5 % infestation) with compounds of Table 1 (e.g. compounds nos. 1.001, 1.003, 1.010, 1.033, 1.034, 1.035, 1.036, 1.037, 1.038, 1.039, 1.040, 1.042, 1.050, 1.051, 1.052, 1.053, 1.054, 1.055, 1.056, 1.061, 1.063, 1.065, 1.066, 1.070, 1.071, 1.072, 1.073, 1.075, 1.076, 1.080, 1.082, 1.086, 1.087, 1.091, 1.093, 1.095, 1.105, 1.128, 1.129, 1.136, 1.204, 1.207, 1.210, 1.219, 1.243, 1.249, 1.255, 1.258, 1.261, 1.264, 1.267, 1.270, 1.271, 1.282, 1.284 and 1.285).
