High-voltage switchgear assembly<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a gas-insulated high-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly. The invention further relates to<br>
modules for the gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear<br>
assembly according to the invention.<br>
It is generally known that gas-insulated high-voltage<br>
switchgear assemblies with rated voltages of above<br>
200 kV are generally designed as single-phase-<br>
encapsulated systems. In this case, the switching<br>
devices, such as circuit breakers, isolabors and<br>
grounding switches, for example, and further<br>
components, such as overhead line connections, for<br>
example, are designed to be single-phase and are<br>
arranged in separate housings.<br>
Also, the three phase conductors of a busbar are<br>
arranged in separate, generally tubular, housings.<br>
However, this design results in a comparatively high<br>
space requirement.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a<br>
high-voltage switchgear assembly having a reduced space<br>
requirement.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a<br>
high-voltage switchgear assembly having the features<br>
mentioned in claim 1.<br>
A gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear assembly<br>
according to the invention comprises at least one<br>
busbar having three phase conductors, each phase<br>
conductor being connected to the input of a busbar<br>
isolator associated with it. In this case, the phase<br>
conductors and the busbar isolators are arranged in a<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 2 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
common three-phase busbar module. The high-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly according to the invention further<br>
comprises three single-phase circuit breakers, which<br>
are each arranged in a separate circuit breaker<br>
housing. Each busbar isolator is in this case connected<br>
on the output side to in each case one circuit breaker<br>
associated with it.<br>
Owing to this arrangement in which the three phase<br>
conductors of a busbar and the associated busbar<br>
isolators are arranged in a common housing, the space<br>
requirement of the high-voltage switchgear assembly is<br>
advantageously reduced in comparison with a<br>
conventional high-voltage switchgear assembly.<br>
The object is also achieved by a busbar module having<br>
the features mentioned in claim 7.<br>
Accordingly, a busbar module according to the<br>
invention, in which three phase conductors of a busbar<br>
and three busbar isolators are arranged and each phase<br>
conductor is connected to the input of the busbar<br>
isolator associated with it, has three single-phase<br>
interfaces, which are each associated with a busbar<br>
isolator.<br>
Such a busbar module allows for a direct and therefore<br>
comparatively simple connection of three single-pole<br>
circuit breakers. It is not necessary to insert<br>
additional modules. The design of the high-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly is simplified, and the embodiment<br>
is particularly space-saving.<br>
The object is also achieved by a splitter module having<br>
the features mentioned in claim 9.<br>
A splitter module according to the invention has at<br>
least one three-phase interface and three single-phase<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 3 -         PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
interfaces. Three phase conductors are guided from the<br>
three-phase interface to in each case the single-phase<br>
interfaces within the splitter module.<br>
Such a splitter module allows for a connection of a<br>
busbar module with a three-phase interface to three<br>
single-phase circuit breakers.<br>
Busbar modules having a three-phase interface are known<br>
for switchgear assemblies having a low rated voltage,<br>
in particular of from 100 kV to 200 kV. Advantageously,<br>
a known busbar module can be used in a high-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly according to the invention with the<br>
aid of a splitter module.<br>
Furthermore, such a splitter module allows three<br>
single-phase circuit breakers to be connected to a<br>
three-phase outgoing feeder unit.<br>
Further advantageous configurations of the invention<br>
are provided in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention, advantageous configurations and<br>
improvements of the invention and further advantages<br>
will be explained and described in more detail with<br>
reference to the drawings, in which exemplary<br>
embodiments of the invention are illustrated and in<br>
which:<br>
figure 1  shows a circuit diagram of a first outgoing<br>
feeder  panel  of  a  switchgear  assembly<br>
according to the invention,<br>
figure 2  shows a circuit diagram of a second outgoing<br>
feeder  panel  of  a  switchgear  assembly<br>
according to the invention,<br>
figure 3  shows a splitter module for connection to two<br>
busbars,<br>
figure 4  shows a splitter module for connection to an<br>
outgoing feeder unit, and<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 4 -         PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
figure 5 shows a circuit diagram of a third outgoing<br>
feeder panel of a switchgear assembly-<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a circuit diagram of a first three-phase<br>
outgoing feeder panel 60 of a three-phase switchgear<br>
assembly according to the invention. The switchgear<br>
assembly is designed for a rated voltage of<br>
approximately from 2 00 kV to 250 kV. However, use at a<br>
lower rated voltage, for example of from 100 kV to<br>
2 00 kV, or at a higher rated voltage, for example of<br>
from 250 kV to 400 kV, is also within the concept of<br>
the invention.<br>
The switchgear assembly illustrated is in the form of a<br>
metal-encapsulated, gas-insulated high-voltage<br>
switchgear assembly. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is used<br>
as the insulating gas. Alternatively, nitrogen (N2) or<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as the insulating gas.<br>
The switchgear assembly has a busbar having three phase<br>
conductors LI, L2, L3. The three phase conductors LI,<br>
L2, L3 are guided in the region of the first; outgoing<br>
feeder panel 60 within a first busbar module 4 0 and<br>
further to busbar modules (not illustrated here) of<br>
adjacent panels.<br>
The  housing  of  the  first  busbar  module	4 0	is<br>
cylindrical, the phase conductors LI, L2, L3	of	the<br>
busbar being guided parallel to the mid-axis	of	the<br>
housing of the first busbar module 40.<br>
The first busbar module 4 0 has three flange connectors<br>
118, 128, 138 for connecting circuit breaker housings<br>
or other modules. These flange connectors are arranged<br>
on the outside of the cylindrical housing of the first<br>
busbar module 4 0 so as to protrude radially and so as<br>
to lie adjacent to one another along a surface line.<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 5 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
Furthermore, the first busbar module 4 has in each case<br>
one flange connector (not illustrated here) for<br>
connecting in each case one further busbar module or<br>
another element, such as a covering cap, for example,<br>
at each end side of its cylindrical housing.<br>
A first busbar isolator 11 is associated with the first<br>
phase conductor LI and is connected on the input side<br>
to the first phase conductor LI. The busbar isolator 11<br>
is in this case likewise arranged within the first<br>
busbar module 40. Correspondingly, the second phase<br>
conductor L2 is connected to a second busbar isolator<br>
21, and the third phase conductor L3 is connected to a<br>
third busbar isolator 31.<br>
Furthermore, in each case one grounding switch (not<br>
illustrated here) is associated with each busbar<br>
isolator 11, 21, 31 and is connected to the output of<br>
the respective busbar isolator 11, 21, 31. The busbar<br>
isolators 11, 21, 31 and the associated grounding<br>
switches can in this case be in the form of separate<br>
switching devices or in the form of a combined<br>
disconnecting and grounding switch. The busbar<br>
isolators 11, 21, 31 are in this case in particular in<br>
the form of sliding-contact isolators, but a<br>
configuration as rotary isolators is also conceivable.<br>
A first circuit breaker 12 is associated with the first<br>
busbar isolator 11, and said first busbar isolator is<br>
connected to said first circuit breaker on the output<br>
side. The first circuit breaker 12 is in rhis case<br>
arranged in a separate, first circuit breaker housing<br>
13, which is fixed on the first flange connector 118 of<br>
the first busbar module 40.<br>
Correspondingly, a second circuit breaker 22 is<br>
associated with the second busbar isolator 21. In this<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 6 -         PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
case, the second circuit breaker 22 is arranged in a<br>
separate second circuit breaker housing 23, which is<br>
fixed to the second flange connector 128 of the first<br>
busbar module 40. A third circuit breaker 32 is<br>
associated with the third busbar isolator 31. The third<br>
circuit breaker 3 2 is arranged in a separate, third<br>
circuit breaker housing 33, which is fixed to the third<br>
flange connector 138 of the first busbar module 40.<br>
The connecting conductors between the busbar isolators<br>
11, 21, 31 and the circuit breakers 12, 22, 32 are in<br>
this case each guided separately through in each case<br>
one of the three flange connectors of the first busbar<br>
module 40.<br>
In addition, in each case one intermediate piece can be<br>
inserted between the circuit breaker housings 13, 23,<br>
33 and the three flange connectors 118, 128, 138 of the<br>
first busbar module 40. Such an intermediate piece is<br>
in the form of a branch piece, for example, and<br>
therefore allows the connection of two or more busbars.<br>
In this way, the circuit breakers can be connected<br>
comparatively easily to a plurality of busbars.<br>
A first outgoing feeder housing 14, which is split into<br>
a plurality of segments (not illustrated here) which<br>
are connected in series, adjoins the first circuit<br>
breaker housing 13. In this case, further components<br>
(not illustrated here), such as an outgoing feeder<br>
isolator and an outgoing feeder grounding switch, for<br>
example, are arranged in the segments of the first<br>
outgoing feeder housing 14. The first outgoing feeder<br>
housing 14 has a first cable connection point 15, to<br>
which a high-voltage cable can be connected.<br>
Correspondingly, the second circuit breaker housing 23<br>
is connected to a second outgoing feeder housing 24,<br>
which has a second cable connection point 25, and the<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 7 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
third circuit breaker housing 33 is connected to a<br>
third outgoing feeder housing 34 with a third cable<br>
connection point 35.<br>
Voltage transformers (not illustrated here) are<br>
arranged on the outgoing feeder housings 14,, 24, 34,<br>
which voltage transformers are connected to the<br>
corresponding phase conductors LI, L2, L3 and measure<br>
their voltage to ground.<br>
Instead of the cable connection points 15,  25,  35,<br>
outdoor  bushings  for  connection  to  cables  of  an<br>
overhead line can also easily be provided. Connection<br>
elements  for  connecting  a  transformer  are  also<br>
conceivable and within the concept of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a circuit diagram of a second three-<br>
phase outgoing feeder panel 70 of a three-phase<br>
switchgear assembly according to the invention. In the<br>
text which follows, the same reference symbols as in<br>
figure 1 are used for identical components. In a<br>
similar manner to as in figure 1, the three phase<br>
conductors LI, L2, L3 of a busbar run within a second,<br>
cylindrical busbar module 41 parallel to its mid-axis,<br>
and the busbar isolators 11, 21, 31, which are<br>
associated with the phase conductors LI, L2, L3, are<br>
arranged within the housing of the second busbar module<br>
41.<br>
The second busbar module 41 has a radially protruding<br>
flange connector, which is arranged on the outside of<br>
the housing of said second busbar module and to which a<br>
first splitter module 42 is fixed.<br>
Furthermore, the second busbar module 41 has in each<br>
case one flange connector (not illustrated here) for<br>
connecting in each case one further busbar module or<br>
another element, such as a covering cap, for example,<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 8 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
at each end side of its cylindrical housing.<br>
The first splitter module 42 has a first three-phase<br>
interface 51 by means of which it is connected to the<br>
outputs of the busbar isolators 11, 21, 31. This first<br>
three-phase interface 51 of the first splitter module<br>
42 also comprises a flange connector, by means of which<br>
the first splitter module 42 is connected, for example<br>
screwed, to the flange connector of the second busbar<br>
module 41.<br>
The first splitter module 42 also has three single-<br>
phase interfaces 16, 26, 36, to which in each case one<br>
single-phase circuit breaker 12, 22, 32 is connected.<br>
The connection between the housing of the first<br>
splitter module 41 and the circuit breaker housings 13,<br>
23, 33 is also produced by means of flange connectors.<br>
All of the switching devices, such as the circuit<br>
breakers 12, 22, 32, the busbar isolators 11, 21, 31 or<br>
grounding switches, for example, are arranged outside<br>
of the housing of the first splitter module 42. Only<br>
rigid electrical conductors are guided in each case<br>
from the single-phase interfaces 16, 26, 36 to the<br>
first three-phase interface 51 in the interior of the<br>
splitter module 42.<br>
On the outgoing feeder side, a third splitter module 44<br>
is connected to the circuit breaker housings 13, 23,<br>
33. The third splitter module 44 has, for this purpose,<br>
three single-phase interfaces 18, 28, 38, by means of<br>
which it is connected to in each case one of the<br>
circuit breaker housings 13, 23, 33. The third splitter<br>
module  44  furthermore  has  a  second  three-phase<br>
interface 52, to which a three-phase outgoing feeder<br>
unit 46 is connected.<br>
The outgoing feeder unit 46 is split into a plurality<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 9 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
of segments (not illustrated here) which are connected<br>
in series and in which further components (not<br>
illustrated here) , such as three outgoing feeder<br>
isolators, three outgoing feeder grounding switches and<br>
three high-speed grounding switches, for example, are<br>
arranged. A three-phase voltage transformer (not<br>
illustrated here), which measures the voltages of the<br>
conductors with respect to one another arid/or the<br>
voltages of the conductors with respect to ground, is<br>
fixed to the outgoing feeder unit 46.<br>
The outgoing feeder unit 4 6 furthermore comprises, on<br>
the outgoing feeder side, a three-phase connection<br>
point (not shown here) having three cable connection<br>
points for connecting a high-voltage cable. Likewise, a<br>
three-phase outdoor bushing for connection to cables of<br>
an overhead line or a three-phase connection element<br>
for connecting a transformer are also conceivable.<br>
As an alternative to the three-phase connection point,<br>
which is laid on the outgoing feeder side, three<br>
single-phase connection points can also be realized,<br>
for example for connecting high-voltage cables.<br>
Switching devices, such as the circuit breakers 12, 22,<br>
32, outgoing feeder isolators or outgoing feeder<br>
grounding switches, for example, are arranged outside<br>
of the housing of the third splitter module 44. Only<br>
rigid electrical conductors are guided in each case<br>
from the single-phase interfaces 18, 28, 38 to the<br>
second three-phase interface 52 in the interior of the<br>
third splitter module 44.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second splitter module 43 having<br>
a third three-phase interface 53 and a fourth three-<br>
phase interface 54. The three-phase interfaces 53, 54<br>
are used for connection to in each case one busbar. The<br>
second  splitter  module  43  in  this  case  has  a<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 10 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
cylindrical housing,  whose mid axis runs at right<br>
angles to the plane of the drawing.<br>
The third three-phase interface 53 is fitted to the<br>
outwardly pointing side of this cylindrical housing.<br>
The third three-phase interface 53 comprises, in<br>
addition to the three electrical phase conductors LI,<br>
L2, L3, a flange connector for fixing it to a second<br>
busbar module 41 (not shown here). The three electrical<br>
phase conductors LI, L2, L3 pass through the flange<br>
connector of the third three-phase interface 53 and can<br>
be connected to busbar isolators of a busbar module.<br>
Furthermore, the fourth three-phase interface 54, which<br>
likewise has three electrical phase conductors LI, L2,<br>
L3 and a flange connector for fixing it to a busbar<br>
module (not shown here), is attached to the outwardly<br>
pointing side of the cylindrical housing of the second<br>
splitter module 43. The three electrical phase<br>
conductors LI, L2, L3 pass through the flange connector<br>
of the fourth three-phase interface 54 and can be<br>
connected to busbar isolators of a busbar module.<br>
Furthermore, a seventh single-phase interface 116, an<br>
eighth single-phase interface and a ninth single-phase<br>
interface are located on the outwardly pointing side of<br>
the cylindrical housing of the second splitter module<br>
43, in this example diametrically opposite the third<br>
three-phase interface 53. These three single-phase<br>
interfaces each have a flange connector for fixing in<br>
each case one circuit breaker housing (not shown here).<br>
Only the seventh single-phase interface 116 is visible<br>
in the illustration shown; the eighth single-phase<br>
interface and the ninth single-phase interface are<br>
hidden by the seventh single-phase interface 116.<br>
The first electrical phase conductor LI passes through<br>
the  flange  connector  of  the  seventh  single-phase<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 11 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
interface 116 and can be connected to a single-phase<br>
circuit breaker.<br>
Correspondingly, the second electrical phase conductor<br>
L2 passes through the flange connector of the eighth<br>
single-phase interface (not visible here) and can be<br>
connected to a single-phase circuit breaker, and the<br>
third electrical phase conductor L3 passes through the<br>
flange connector of the ninth single-phase interface<br>
(not visible here) and can likewise be connected to a<br>
single-phase circuit breaker.<br>
A seventh current transformer 117, which is arranged<br>
within the housing of the second splitter module 43 in<br>
the vicinity of the seventh single-phase interface 116<br>
and surrounds the first phase conductor LI, is<br>
associated with the seventh single-phase interface 116.<br>
Correspondingly, an eighth current transformer, which<br>
is arranged within the housing of the second splitter<br>
module 4 3 in the vicinity of the eighth single-phase<br>
interface and surrounds the phase conductor L2, is<br>
associated with the eighth single-phase interface. A<br>
ninth current transformer, which is arranged within the<br>
housing of the second splitter module 43 in the<br>
vicinity of the ninth single-phase interface and<br>
surrounds the phase conductor L3, is associated with<br>
the ninth single-phase interface.<br>
In the illustration shown, that section of the phase<br>
conductor L2 which runs through the eighth single-phase<br>
interface and that section of the phase conductor L3<br>
which runs through the ninth single-phase interface are<br>
not visible, since they are hidden by the first phase<br>
conductor LI. Likewise, the eighth current transformer<br>
and the ninth current transformer are hidden by the<br>
seventh current transformer 117.<br><br>

In this example, the second splitter module 4 3 has two<br>
three-phase interfaces 53, 54. However, it is also<br>
conceivable for one splitter module to have only one or<br>
more than two, for example three, three-phase<br>
interfaces.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the third splitter module 44 for<br>
connection to an outgoing feeder unit. The third<br>
splitter module 44 has a second three-phase interface<br>
52, which has, in addition to the three-electrical<br>
phase conductors LI, L2, L3, a flange connector for<br>
fixing an outgoing feeder unit (not shown here).<br>
Furthermore, the third splitter module 44 has a fourth<br>
single-phase interface 18, a fifth single-phase<br>
interface 28 and a sixth single-phase interface 38. The<br>
three single-phase interfaces 18, 28, 38 each comprise<br>
a flange connector for fixing in each case one circuit<br>
breaker housing (not shown here).<br>
A conductor section of the first phase conductor LI<br>
passes through the flange connector of the second<br>
three-phase interface 52 and is guided through the<br>
interior of the housing of the third splitter module 44<br>
to the fourth single-phase interface 18, which it<br>
likewise passes through.<br>
A conductor section of the second phase conductor L2<br>
passes through the flange connector of the second<br>
three-phase interface 52 and is guided through the<br>
interior of the housing of the third splitter module 44<br>
to the fifth single-phase interface 28, which it<br>
likewise passes through. Correspondingly, a conductor<br>
section of the third phase conductor L3 passes through<br>
the flange connector of the second three-phase<br>
interface 52 and is guided through the interior of the<br>
housing of the third splitter module 44 to the sixth<br>
single-phase interface 38,  which it likewise passes<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 13 -        PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
through.<br>
A fourth current transformer 19, which is associated<br>
with the fourth single-phase interface 18, is arranged<br>
within the third splitter module 44 in the vicinity of<br>
the fourth single-phase interface 18 and surrounds the<br>
first phase conductor LI.<br>
Correspondingly, a fifth current transformer 29, which<br>
surrounds the phase conductor L2, is associated with<br>
the fifth single-phase interface 28, and a sixth<br>
current transformer 39, which surrounds the phase<br>
conductor L3, is associated with the sixth single-phase<br>
interface 38.<br>
In the example shown, the second three-phase interface<br>
52 is arranged on that side of the housing of the third<br>
splitter module 44 which lies diametrically opposite<br>
the single-phase interfaces 18, 28, 38. Other<br>
arrangements are also conceivable. For example, the<br>
three-phase interface 52 can be arranged such that its<br>
mid-axis forms a right angle with the mid-axes of the<br>
single-phase interfaces 18, 28, 38.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a circuit diagram of a third<br>
three-phase outgoing feeder panel 80 of a three-phase<br>
switchgear assembly according to the invention. The<br>
third outgoing feeder panel 80 in this case has a<br>
second busbar module 41. A radially protruding flange<br>
connector, to which a first splitter module 42 is fixed<br>
by means of the flange connector of its first three-<br>
phase interface 51, is attached to the outside of the<br>
cylindrical housing of the second busbar module 41.<br>
In each case one single-phase circuit breaker 12, 22,<br>
32 is connected to the single-phase interfaces 16, 26,<br>
36 of the first splitter module 42. In this case, in<br>
each case one single-phase outgoing feeder housing 14,<br><br>
WO 2006/066785	- 14 -       PCT/EP2005/013474<br>
24, 25 is connected to the circuit breaker housings 13,<br>
23, 33 of the single-phase circuit breakers 12, 22, 32.<br><br>
