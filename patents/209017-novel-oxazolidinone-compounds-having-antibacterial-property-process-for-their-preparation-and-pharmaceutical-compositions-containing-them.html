Filed of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel oxazolidinone compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel oxazolidinones of the general formula (I). <br>
their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The present invention also relates to novel intermediates, methods for their preparation and their use in the preparation of compounds of formula (I).<br>
Oxazolidinones are useful as antibacterials (J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 673), antihistamines and anti allergic agents (EP 291,244), anticonvulsants (DE 3,915,184), treating cognition disorders, anti psychotics, platelet ant aggregators, antidepressants, sedatives, hypnotics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (WO 97/13768) and as chiral auxiliaries (Aldrichimica Acta, 1982, 15 23) in asymmetric synthesis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Since the discovery of penicillin, pharmaceutical companies have produced more than one hundred antibacterial agents to combat a wide variety of bacterial infections. In the past several years, due to the misuse of these antibiotics there has been rapid emergence of bacterial resistance to several of these antibiotics. The multidrug resistance among these bacterial pathogens may also be due to mutation leading to more virulent clinical isolation, the most disturbing milestone has been the acquisition of resistance to vancomycin, an antibiotic<br><br>
generally regarded as the agent of last resort for serious Gram-positive infections. This growing multidrug resistance has recently rekindled interest in the search for new structural class of antibiotic that inhibit or kill these bacteria possibly by novel mechanisms.<br>
A problem of larger dimension is the increasing incidence of the more virulent, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among clinical isolates found worldwide. As with vancomycin resistant organisms, many MRSA strains are resistant to most of the known antibiotics, but MRSA strains have remained sensitive to vancomycin. However, in view of the increasing reports of vancomycin resistant clinical isolates and growing problem of bacterial resistance, there is an urgent need for new molecular entities effective against the emerging and currently problematic Gram-positive organisms.<br>
Recently, several oxazolidinones have been discovered, which inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50S-ribosomal subunit which is close to the site to which chloramphenicol and lincomycin bind but their mode of action is mechanistically distinct from these two antibiotics.<br>
The new class of oxazolidinones of the present invention is useful for the treatment of a number of resistant and sensitive gram-positive strains both in vitro and in vivo. Some of the hitherto known compounds described in the prior art are outlined below: (i)        International Patent Application WO 93/23384 discloses compounds of formula<br>

They can also be used for the treatment of bacterial infections associated with multidrug resistance.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of compound of fonnula (I) forming parr of this invention may be prepared by conventional methods such as dissolving the compounds of formula (I) in solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol etc., preferably water and recrystallizing by using different crystallization techniques.<br>
The phamiaceutical compositions may be in the forms normally employed, such as tablets, capsules, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like, may contain tlavorants. sweeteners etc. in suitable solid or liquid carriers or diluents, or in suitable sterile media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. Such compositions typically contain from 1 to 20 %. preferably 1 to 10 % by weight of active compound, the remainder of the composition being pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or solvents.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and sterile aqueous or organic solutions. The active compounds will be present in such pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in the range as described above. Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can be combined with a suitable solid, liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules, tablets, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions, may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavorants, sweeteners, excipients and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds can be combined with sterile aqueous or organic media to form injectable solutions<br><br>
or suspensions. For example, solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts or salts with base of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this manner can then be administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously. or intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred in humans.<br>
In addition to the compounds of formula (I) the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also contain or be co-administered with one or more known drugs selected from other clinically useful antibacterial agents such as P-lactams or aminoglycosides. These may include penicillins such as oxacillin or flucloxacillin and carbapenems such as meropenem or imiphenem to broaden the therapeutic effectiveness against, for example. methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention may also contain or be co-admistered with bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein product (BPI) or efflux pump inhibitors to improve activity against gram negative bacteria and bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including human beings, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnonnality, it is essential that the drug be administered parenterally. By either route, the dosage is in the range of about 5 mg/kg to about 20 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
