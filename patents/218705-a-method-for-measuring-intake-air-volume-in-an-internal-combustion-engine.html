				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for measuring intake air<br>
volume based on which a fuel injection amount is calculated in an internal<br>
combustion engine, and more particularly, to a method for measuring intake air<br>
volume in an internal combustion engine in which the intake air volume is<br>
calculated using a pressure inside an air intake pipe as a parameter.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general in internal combustion engines, since a fuel injection amount<br>
is set based on intake air volume, it is required to always measure the intake air<br>
volume.<br>
In particular, in an independent air intake type of internal combustion<br>
engine such as a multi-slot type and single cylinder type, since there is no air<br>
intake chamber upstream of an air intake pipe, it is difficult to measure the intake<br>
air volume.<br>
Therefore, it has been performed that the intake air volume is estimated<br>
using the number of rotations of the internal combustion engine and a throttle<br>
open angle as parameters.<br>
However, in such a method, there occurs an inconvenience that the<br>
actual intake air volume departs from the state of operation of the internal<br>
combustion engine that is determined based on the number of rotations and the<br>
throttle open angle.<br>
In order to overcome such an inconvenience, a method has been<br>
proposed of detecting a pressure inside an air intake pipe using an intake air<br>
pressure sensor and based on the intake air pressure, estimating the intake air<br>
volume.<br>
When applying such an estimation method to the independent air intake<br>
type of internal combustion engine, since there is no air intake chamber as<br>
described above, a large intake air pressure pulsation occurs, which causes such<br>
an inconvenience such that the intake air volume cannot be measured accurately.<br>
That is, such a large pulsation occurs, in particular, when a large<br>
negative pressure is generated in the intake at the time of medium load and then<br>
the pressure returns to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
In order to estimate the intake air volume, it is required to unify varying<br>
intake air pressures, and therefore, the varying intake air pressures are averaged.<br>
However, when averaging the large intake air pressure pulsation as<br>
described above, since pressures near the atmospheric pressure are also included<br>
to average, it is not possible to estimate an accurate intake air volume, and such<br>
averaging is not effective in estimating the intake air volume.<br>
Further, in order to overcome such an inconvenience, a method has been<br>
performed of extracting intake air pressures at specific timing or in a specific<br>
range with respect to a crank angle signal, and averaging the specific intake air<br>
pressures.<br>
For example, as disclosed in JP H11-62691, intake air pressures near the<br>
bottom dead center of the piston are averaged.<br>
However, in the method for estimating the intake air volume using the<br>
value obtained by averaging intake air pressures in such a specific range, it is<br>
required to set the timing of detecting the intake air pressure using the crank<br>
angle signal, resulting in a problem that the control is complicated.<br>
Further, when an intake air pressure sensor is provided at a position<br>
some distance from an air intake pipe (for example, in an engine control unit),<br>
the air intake pipe and intake air pressure sensor are communicated using a<br>
connecting pipe.<br>
Therefore, a timewise delay occurs between an actual variation in<br>
pressure inside the air intake pipe and a detected variation in pressure, or the<br>
detected variation in pressure is smoothed as compared to the actual, variation in<br>
pressure i.e. so-called rounding occurs, depending on the capacity ot the connecting<br>
pipe, thereby making it difficult to sample accurate intake air pressures at specific<br>
crank timings.<br>
In view of the above-mentioned conventional problems, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method for measuring intake air volume in an internal<br>
combustion engine, which enables estimation of intake air volume with high precision,<br>
by setting the relationship between a detected intake air pressure and intake air volume<br>
to be more linear independently of crank timing, in estimating the intake air volume<br>
based on the intake air pressure.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, in a method for measuring intake air<br>
volume in an internal combustion engine as described in the present invention, intake<br>
air pressures in the internal combustion engine are detected at a plurality of timings<br>
during all the strokes of the internal combustion engine, a. threshold pressure is set<br>
between a minimum value and maximum value of detected intake air pressures, intake<br>
air pressures less than or equal to the threshold pressure among the detected intake air<br>
pressures are averaged to obtain an average intake air pressure, and using the average<br>
intake air pressure as a parameter, the intake air volume is measured.<br>
In the method for measuring intake air volume in an internal combustion engine<br>
as described in the present invention, a difference between the maximum value and<br>
minimum value of intake air pressures is obtained, and a predetermined rate of the<br>
difference between the maximum value and minimum value is added to the minimum<br>
value to set the threshold pressure.<br>
In the method for measuring intake air volume in an internal combustion engine<br>
as described the present invention, the maximum value as described in the atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
In the method for measuring intake air volume in an internal combustion engine<br>
of the present invention, the maximum value is an average value of all the intake air<br>
pressures detected in all the strokes of the internal combustion engine.<br>
In the method for measuring intake air volume in an internal combustion engine<br>
of the present invention, a virtual intake air pressure line is created by connecting<br>
linearly all the intake air pressures detected in all the strokes of the internal<br>
combustion engine as described in present invention and based on the virtual intake air<br>
pressure line, the average intake air pressure is calculated.<br>
In the method for measuring intake air volume in an internal combustion engine<br>
as described in the present invention, the predetermined rate of the difference between<br>
the maximum value and minimum value which is added to the minimum value is<br>
varied corresponding to the state of operation of the internal combustion engine.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
One embodiment of the present invention will be described below with<br>
reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1is a view showing a schematic configuration of a principal portion<br>
of an internal combustion engine 1 to which this embodiment is applied. The<br>
internal combustion engine 1 is generally comprised of a cylinder block 3 to<br>
which a piston 2 is inserted slidably, a cylinder head 4 that is mounted on an<br>
upper portion of the cylinder block 3 and forms a combustion chamber, an intake<br>
valve 5 and an exhaust valve 6 that are attached to the cylinder head 4 to be<br>
opened and closed, an intake pipe 7 that is continuously provided to the cylinder<br>
head 4 and forms an intake passage, an exhaust pipe 8 that is opened and closed<br>
by the exhaust valve 6, a fuel injection nozzle 9 that injects the fuel inside the<br>
intake pipe 7, a throttle valve 10 that controls the intake air volume, an air<br>
cleaner 11 that is attached to an end portion on upstream side of the intake pipe 7,<br>
a crank angle sensor 12 for detecting a rotation position of a crank shaft (not<br>
shown) coupled to the piston 2, an intake air pressure sensor 14 that is<br>
communicated with the intake pipe 7 via an connecting pipe 13 and detects a<br>
pressure inside the intake pipe 7, and a CPU 15 that controls operation of the<br>
internal combustion engine 1.<br>
Thus, the internal combustion engine 1 composes an independent air<br>
intake type of internal combustion engine where each cylinder has an air intake<br>
system.<br>
The following is given of a method for measuring intake air volume in<br>
the internal combustion engine 1 according to this embodiment.<br>
In this embodiment, an intake air pressure V in the internal combustion<br>
engine 1 is detected at each of a plurality of timings (in this embodiment,<br>
detected at eight points, X1 to X8, as shown in Fig.2) during all the strokes of<br>
the internal combustion engine 1, based on these detected values V1 to V8 an<br>
average intake air pressure Vave is calculated according to following procedures,<br>
and the intake air volume is measured using the average intake air pressure Vave<br>
as a parameter.<br>
1: Detect a minimum value Vmin of the intake air pressure.<br>
2: Detect a maximum value Vmax of the intake air pressure.<br>
3: Calculate Vmax-Vmin=Vdif.<br>
4: Calculate VdifxR(%)=Voff.<br>
In addition, R is a predetermined rate and a constant set as appropriate.<br>
5: Calculate Vmin+Voff=Vref<br>
6: Among the detected intake air pressures, intake air pressures not more than<br>
Vref (hereinafter, referred to as a threshold pressure) calculated in procedure 5<br>
are averaged to calculate the average intake air pressure Vave.<br>
To explain a specific example, Fig.2 shows variations in intake air<br>
pressure during all the strokes of the internal combustion engine with low load,<br>
where eight detection timings of intake air pressure are provided and indicated<br>
by X1 to X8, while pressures detected at detection timings X1 to X8 are<br>
indicated by V1 to V8, respectively.<br>
In this figure, Vmax is V8 (Vmax=V8), Vmin is V2 (Vmin=V2), and<br>
when the constant R is set at 50%, the following equations are obtained:<br>
Vdif=Vmax-Vmin=V8-V2 ... Eq. (1)<br>
Voff=Vdifx50%=(V8-V2)x50% ... Eq. (2)<br>
Vref=Vmin+Voff=V2+(V8-V2)x50% ... Eq. (3)<br>
The threshold pressure Vref obtained from the above Equation 3 is<br>
indicated by straight line A in Fig.2, and detected pressures less than the<br>
threshold pressure Vref are V1, V2, V3 and V4.<br>
Then, the average intake air pressure Vave is calculated by averaging<br>
detected values V1, V2, V3 and V4. In other words:<br>
Vave=( V1+V2+V3+V4)/4<br>
The relationships each between thus obtained average intake air pressure<br>
Vave and suction intake amount (intake air volume) are shown in Fig.3 to Fig. 5<br>
by curves S1 to S11. In the figures, S1 to S11 are curves when R is varied, and<br>
the relationships are as follows:<br>
R(S1)=5, R(S2)=10, R(S3)=20, R(S4)=30, R(S5)=40, R(S6)=50,<br>
R(S7)=60, R(S8)=70, R(S9)=80, R(S10)=90, and<br>
R(S11)=100.<br>
Further, Fig.3 shows results of a case that the number of rotations of the<br>
internal combustion engine 1 is 1000 (rpm), Fig.4 shows results of a case that the<br>
number of rotations of the internal combustion engine 1 is 4000 (rpm), and Fig.5<br>
shows results of a case that the number of rotations of the internal combustion<br>
engine 1 is 7000 (rpm).<br>
As is apparent from these results, when 5<r the relationship></r>
between the calculated average intake air pressure Vave and the intake air<br>
volume (mass of intake air) is approximately linear in almost all the load regions.<br>
Accordingly, by selecting the constant R as appropriate, even when the<br>
calculated average intake air pressure Vave is used as a parameter of the intake<br>
air volume, it is possible to estimate the intake air volume with high precision,<br>
and as a result, it is possible to control a fuel injection amount properly.<br>
Further, according to this embodiment, intake air pressures in all the<br>
strokes of the internal combustion engine 1 are detected at a plurality of timings,<br>
and based on the plurality of detected intake air pressures V1 to V8, the average<br>
intake air pressure Vave is calculated, whereby it is possible to calculate the<br>
average intake air pressure Vave independently of the crank angle of the internal<br>
combustion engine 1.<br>
Accordingly, in the case where the intake air pressure sensor 14 is<br>
provided at a position spaced from the intake pipe 7 using the connecting pipe 13,<br>
when delays and/or rounding occurs in variations in the detected intake air<br>
pressure with respect to variations in the intake air pressure of the intake pipe 7,<br>
effects of the delays and rounding are suppressed, and the control to estimate the<br>
intake air volume is made easy, while being performed with high precision.<br>
Further, reduced effects of the connecting pipe 13 that causes the delays<br>
and rounding enhance the versatility of setting position of the intake air pressure<br>
sensor 14 i.e. the versatility of layout of structural members of an internal<br>
combustion engine.<br>
Furthermore, in the conventional method for estimating intake air<br>
volume using intake air pressures in all the strokes as parameters, since the<br>
relationship between the intake air pressure and the intake air volume becomes<br>
inaccurate at the time of high load, it is required to switch the control method at<br>
the time of high load to a method for estimating the intake air volume using the<br>
throttle open angle and the number of rotations of the internal combustion engine.<br>
In contrast thereto, such switching of control is not required in this embodiment.<br>
Also from this respect, the control to estimate the intake air volume is<br>
made, and since a throttle open angle signal is not required to estimate the intake<br>
air volume, a control apparatus is simplified.<br>
Then, the constant R is set based on a state of the load on internal<br>
combustion engine 1, and is selected so that the relationships between the<br>
average intake air pressure Vave and the intake air volume in load regions are in<br>
good agreement as possible with one another.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in Figs.6 to 8, at the time of high load (when the<br>
throttle open angle is large), the intake air pressure is affected by inertia of the<br>
intake air flowing inside the intake pipe 7, which causes such a phenomenon that<br>
the maximum value Vmax of the intake air pressure varies greatly.<br>
In Figs.6 to 8, curves T1 to T14 are intake air pressure variation curves<br>
corresponding to throttle open angles, and are obtained in increasing the throttle<br>
open angle gradually in a range of 0.5 to 90 degrees so that T1<t2></t2>
Thus, when the maximum value Vmax of the intake air pressure V varies,<br>
it is presumed that the stable detection cannot be performed due to the<br>
relationship between the pressure and detection timing of the pressure.<br>
In order to suppress effects of such a phenomenon, it is effective to set<br>
the maximum value Vmax to be the atmospheric pressure.<br>
It is because the maximum pressure available inside the intake pipe 7 is<br>
the atmospheric pressure when estimating a static flow of intake air inside the<br>
intake pipe 7, and by adopting the atmospheric pressure as the maximum value<br>
Vmax, variations are suppressed in the maximum value Vmax that is a threshold<br>
value of the intake air volume estimation, thereby enhancing the precision in<br>
estimating the intake air volume.<br>
Then, when the maximum value Vmax is thus the atmospheric pressure,<br>
the relationship between the average intake air pressure Vave and the intake air<br>
volume is obtained in almost the same way as in the case where the maximum<br>
value Vmax is a detected value, and a detected value is detected at a position<br>
where the detected Vmax is stable as described previously.<br>
Further, in either method for measuring intake air volume as described<br>
previously, as shown in Figs.3 to 5, such a phenomenon occurs that the<br>
relationship between the average intake air pressure Vave and the intake air<br>
volume deteriorates at the time of low load.<br>
It is presumed that the phenomenon occurs due to the fact that variations<br>
in pressure inside the intake pipe occurring in an exhaust stroke at the time of<br>
low load affect the average calculation processing.<br>
Then, in order to improve the relationship between the calculated<br>
average intake air pressure Vave and the intake air volume in a low load region,<br>
the maximum value Vmax is set at the average value of all the intake air<br>
pressures (V1 to V8 in this embodiment) detected in all the strokes of the<br>
internal combustion engine 1, and it is thereby possible to resolve the<br>
inconvenience at the time of low load as described previously.<br>
Figs.9 to 11 each show the relationship between the average intake air<br>
pressure Vave and the intake air volume with the average value of all the<br>
detected intake air pressures set as the maximum value Vmax in cases where the<br>
number of rotations of the internal combustion engine 1 is 1000(rpm), 4000(rpm)<br>
or 7000(rpm), respectively.<br>
Herein, curves S1 to S11 were obtained by increasing the constant R<br>
gradually so that curve S1
Thus, by setting the maximum value Vmax at the average value of all<br>
the intake pressures (V1 to V8 in this embodiment) detected in all the strokes of<br>
the internal combustion engine 1, the relationship between the calculated average<br>
intake air pressure Vave and the intake air volume is greatly improved at the time<br>
of low load.<br>
Further, as shown in Figs.l2(a) and 12(b), with respect to set two<br>
constants Rs, despite of a small difference between threshold pressures Vrefs<br>
calculated from the constants Rs respectively, it is presumed that the number of<br>
intake pressures Vs added in calculating the average intake air pressure Vave<br>
varies, and that the value of calculated average intake air pressure Vave varies<br>
greatly.<br>
In the sample shown in the figure, the increased number corresponds to<br>
intake air pressure VI, and such a phenomenon tends to occur when detection<br>
internals of the intake air pressure V are large and the number of sampling is<br>
small.<br>
In order to prevent the average intake air pressure Vave from varying<br>
greatly in response to a minute variation in the threshold pressure Vref,<br>
following measures are further considered.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 13, a virtual intake air pressure line M is created<br>
by linearly connecting all the intake air pressures (V1 to V8 in this embodiment)<br>
detected in all the strokes of the internal combustion engine 1, the intake air<br>
pressures (shown by the oblique lines in Fig. 13) indicated by the virtual intake<br>
air pressure line M are averaged between two intersection points (points Y and Z<br>
in Fig. 13) of the virtual intake air pressure line M and the threshold pressure Vref,<br>
and thus the average intake air pressure Vave is calculated.<br>
By using the virtual intake air pressure line M, intervals between<br>
adjacent detected intake air pressures in V1 to V8 are made continuous virtually,<br>
and thereby, higher and lower intake air pressures Vs near a detected intake air<br>
pressure V are selected. Therefore, a variation in the calculated average intake<br>
air pressure Vave is suppressed to a small value with respect to a minute<br>
variation in the threshold pressure Vref, and the relationship between the average<br>
intake air pressure Vave and the intake air volume is made more linear.<br>
In addition, the form, size and others of each structural member<br>
illustrated in the above embodiment are samples, and are capable of being<br>
modified variously based on design requirements or the like.<br>
For example, it may be possible to use an intake air pressure obtained at<br>
a crank angle of near 540 degrees as the maximum value Vmax used in<br>
calculating the average intake air pressure Vave.<br>
This is based on the fact that the intake valve 5 is closed at the crank<br>
angle and the pressure inside the intake pipe 7 is relatively stable, and such an<br>
advantage is obtained that the relationship between the average intake air<br>
pressure Vave and the intake air volume can be made more linear at the time of<br>
low load.<br>
However, in this case, since it is required to make a judgment on intake<br>
or exhaust stroke, the control is made complicated to some extent.<br>
Further, at the time of high load, as shown by the oblique lines in Fig. 14,<br>
such a phenomenon occurs that the intake air pressure V is pulsated.<br>
When such a pulsation occurs, the number of intersection points of the<br>
threshold pressure Vref calculated at the beginning and virtual intake air pressure<br>
line M is multiple as shown by Y1 to Y3 and Z1 to Z3 in Fig. 14, a plurality of<br>
averaging regions, H1 to H3, is set by these intersection points, and in estimating<br>
the intake air volume, a procedure is required that average values of averaging<br>
regions H1 to H3 are further averaged to obtain the average intake air pressure<br>
Vave. Moreover, since it is required to calculate intersection points Y1 to Y3 and<br>
Z1 to Z3, an inconvenience occurs that the control is complicated.<br>
However, at the time of such a high load, since the pressure inside the<br>
intake pipe 7 is assumed to be approximately equal to the atmospheric pressure,<br>
by adding a correction pressure V a of a predetermined value to the calculated<br>
threshold pressure Vref as shown in Fig. 14, the intake air pressures in all the<br>
stokes are averaged, and it is possible to eliminate the effects associated with the<br>
pulsation as described previously.<br>
The addition processing of the correction intake air pressure Va can be<br>
performed by switching the control method at the time the load becomes high,<br>
while it is possible to perform the addition processing in all load regions.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, according to the method for measuring intake air<br>
volume in an internal combustion engine of the present invention, it is possible<br>
to estimate the intake air volume with high precision even using an intake air<br>
pressure as a parameter for the intake air volume, and as a result, it is possible to<br>
control a fuel injection amount properly.<br>
Moreover, intake pressures in all the strokes of the internal combustion<br>
engine 1 are detected at a plurality of timings, the average intake air pressure is<br>
calculated based on the plurality of detected intake air pressures, and therefore,<br>
the average intake air pressure is calculated independently of the crank angle of<br>
the internal combustion engine.<br>
Accordingly, even when the intake air pressure sensor is provided at a<br>
position some distance apart from the intake pipe using a connecting pipe and<br>
delays and rounding occurs in variations in detected intake air pressure with<br>
respect to variations in intake air pressure inside the intake pipe, it is possible to<br>
suppress effects of the delays and rounding, and to perform the control to<br>
estimate the intake air volume with ease and with high precision.<br>
Further, since the effects of delays and rounding caused by using the<br>
connecting pipe and others are reduced, it is possible to enhance the versatility of<br>
setting position of an intake air pressure sensor, in other words, to enhance the<br>
versatility of layout of structural members of the internal combustion engine.<br>
Furthermore, in a conventional method for estimating intake air volume<br>
using an intake air pressure as a parameter, since the relationship between the<br>
intake air pressure and the intake air volume becomes inaccurate at the time of<br>
high load, it is required to switch the control method at the time of high load to a<br>
method for estimating intake air volume using the throttle open angle and the<br>
number of rotations of the internal combustion engine. However, in the present<br>
invention such control switching operation is not required, the control to estimate<br>
the intake air volume is made easy also in this respect, and since the throttle open<br>
angle signal is not required to estimate the intake air volume, it is possible to<br>
simplify the control apparatus.<br>
