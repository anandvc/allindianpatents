				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of a one piece insert useful for an artificial foot. The invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of a one piece insert consisting of the components such as the ankle block,forefoot and the hindfoot. The one piece insert prepared by the process of the invention can be used for the preparation of an artificial foot such as the Jaipur foot. The process of the present invention is less labor intensive, cost effective and amenable to semi or automatic production techniques.<br>
In our copending application number 1096/del/93 (Patent no. 187914) we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of polyol useful for ankle block preparation. In application nos. 1087/del/93(Patent no. 187915) we have claimed and described process for the preparation of ankle and fore/hindfoot components respectively. These components can be used in the preparation of an artificial foot such as the Jaipur foot by the process of the present invention.<br>
Jaipur foot is an extensively used and very well accepted rehabilitation aid for the physically handicapped persons in this country. The number of amputees who have been fitted with these foot piece runs into hundreds and thousands. The utility of the foot has been well proven and there is a heavy demand from several countries including some of the advanced countries due to the mobility offered by the design, of the said foot.<br>
A number of alternative rehabilitation aids for the physically handicapped are available from the western world. The major difficulty of these rehabilitation aids, not acceptable in our country is due to the differences in the life style of the persons affected. The western style of rehabilitation aids for the physically handicapped has closed shoe wearing norm in contrast to the needs of the patients of this country where<br>
bare foot walking and use of well ventilated footwear for the warm climate is the preferred option. The Jaipur foot was first introduced in 1970 and though there have been design changes to suit the needs of the patients from time to time, the basic features continue to be followed.<br>
The conventional Jaipur foot is made from wood laminates shaped to form the ankle block portion and microcellular rubber blocks for the forefoot and hind foot. The three components are held together by a nylon reinforced tyrecord and enclosed within a cover of skin colored solid elastomer. The foot has been used in tough field conditions and is very well accepted by the handicapped persons. The conventional hindfoot component preparation has the following drawbacks :<br>
1.	The ankle block is made from wood and shaped to give the shape of the<br>
ankle   and is highly labour intensive and requires special skill of   the<br>
worker so that the block is useful<br>
2.	The   process   for  the   hindfoot   manufacturing   involves   preparation  of<br>
laminates of microcellular rubber and then manually carving the laminates<br>
into a form of hindfoot. The process is thus highly labor intensive and time<br>
consuming.<br>
3.	The hindfoot is heavy and the product is non-standardized in the sense that<br>
there is a large variation in the    product depending on the technician<br>
making the product and the material used.<br>
4. The technology is hand crafted and leads to unacceptable variations in the quality in addition to variations in the quality of microcellular rubber obtained from various sources.<br>
Most of the drawbacks were eliminated by the process fully described in copending applications bearing no. 1087/del/93 (Patent no. 187915) wherein we have claimed and described process for the preparation of ankle and fore/hindfoot components respectively. The process for the preparation of an artificial foot such as the Jaipur foot still required the tying of the individual components namely the ankle block,hindfoot block and the forefoot blocks with a nylon tyrecord. The components tied together were then used for the preparation of an artificial foot. The drawback in this process is that the labour involved and the skill involved in tying of the individual components of the foot. Failures resulted if the components were not tied together properly.<br>
The main object of this invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of the single insert using appropriate polyurcthane composition to give rigid, semi-rigid and flexible foam respectively. The single piece insert prepared by the process of this invention could then be used for the preparation of the artificial foot eliminating the procedure of tying the components. The polyurethane foam should be rigid for the ankle block part, semi-rigid in nature for the forefoot component and flexible in nature for the hindfoot component. The characteristics of the resultant foam are as follows :<br>
(a)	The density of the foam should be in the range of 0.38 to 0.42 gm/cc.<br>
(b)	The cell structure of the foam should be uniform.<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that the three components namely, the ankle,fore foot arid the hind foot are held together firmly by the use of the appropriate polyurethane formulation. Since all the components rare made from appropriate polyurethane formulation the one piece insert can be postcured at one time instead of curing the individual components separately and the adhesion between the components is very good.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of a one piece insert consisting of the components such as the ankle block.forefoot and the hindfoot useful in the preparation of an artificial foot which comprises a) coating the mold with relaxing agent such as herein described, b)casting flexible polyurethane formulation such as herein described for the hind foot c) allowing the formulation to solidify by maintaining the mold at a temperature in the range of 27 to 35 deg.C for a period upto 60 minutes, d) repeating step a), e)casting the rigid formulations such as herein described for the ankle and semirigid formulation such as herein described for fore foot wherein the order of casting can be varied, maintaining the mold at a temperature in the range of 27 to 35 deg.C for a period upto 60 minutes, f) demolding the one piece insert as obtained in steps c) and e) and postcuring the product at a temperature in the range of 80 to 100 deg.C for a period ranging from 2 to 4 hours.<br>
According to another feature of the invention the polyurethane for the ankle and fore foot components are prepared by the process described and claimed in our copending application numbers 1087/del/93(Patent no. 187915).<br>
In another copending application number 1086/DEL/93 we have described a process for the preparation of polyol useful for preparation of formulations and components such as ankle block.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the formulation for the ankle component can be cast first followed by the casting of the fore foot and hind foot components. The order of casting the components can be varied to suit the convenience.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, since all the components are made from polyurethane formulation, adhesion between the different components are very good.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, preparation of all the components in a single mold helps in saving of considerable time and labour as the process described as per the process of this invention does not require the need to tie the components with tyre cords as is done in conventional foot components.<br>
The invention is described with reference to examples typically describing the casting of the ankle block, fore foot and hind fool components for the foot of si/.e 7. The examples given below should not however be construed to limit the scope this invention.<br>
The preparation of polyester polyol that forms the resin component and is useful for the preparation of the polyurethane hindlbot, forefoot component and the ankle block component of an artificial foot, such as the Jaipur foot may be done by any of the known conventional process.<br>
Preferably the polyol can be prepared by reacting a diacid with di or polyhydroxy compounds under inert atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 200 °C<br>
to 220 °C for a period ranging from 7 to 1 1 hours, in the presence of a polyesterificalion catalyst, continuously removing (lie water Ibimed timing the reaclion by using xylcnc and removing the product from the reactor. The reaction product, the polyol was obtained in the form of a viscous liquid. The di or polyhydroxy component is selected from ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and glycerin, Irimethylol propane and pentaerythrilol. 1 he diacid is selected from succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid and the like. The polyesterification catalyst may be chosen from para toluene sulphonic acid and organometallic catalysis such as titanium tetra butoxide, Zinc di butoxide and the like.<br>
The invention is described with reference to examples typically describing the casting of the ankle block, fore foot and hind foot components Ibr the loot of size 7. The examples given below should not however be construed to limit the scope this invention. Polyol Preparation for the hindfoot/furcfoot:<br>
768.69 grams of adipic acid, 668.78 I'lams of dielhylene glycol, 6.06 grams of para toluene sulphonie acid and 25 ml xylene were taken in a reaction vessel. The reaction vessel was a four necked round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer for stirring the reactants, an opening for maintaining an inert atmosphere, provision for placing a thermowel to monitor the temperature of reaclion and an opening to fix a clean-stark apparatus. The reaclion assembly was set up after weighing the reactants. The dean-stark column was filled with xylene. The reaction mixture was heated from ambient temperature to a temperature of 120 °C at the rate of 4 °C per minute and 120 °C to 180 °C at the rate of 2 °C per minute. Acid value of the reaction mixture was continuously monitored during the heating c\cle and 129.9 grams of trimethylol propane<br>
was added to the reaction mixture at an acid value of 30 milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram oi sample. Rcactanls held at 180 °C constant for 120 minutes. The temperature was further increased from 180 °C to 200 °C at the rate of 1 °C per minute. The reactants were held at this temperature for 3 hours and then the temperature was raised to 220 °C at the rate of 1 °C per minute and held at this temperature for 3.5 hours to get the polyester polyol. The reaction was monitored by acid value of the reaction mixture estimated by drawing the samples at various times during the course of reaction. When the acid value reached 13 milligrams ol potassium hydroxide per gram of sample, the xylene was removed from the dean-stark apparatus and the xylene present in the reaction mixture was started removing using fast purge of nitrogen. When the acid value of the batch reached below 2 milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample, the heating was stopped. When the reaction mixture reaches at 180 °C vacuum applied for 240 minutes. After that reaction mixture was cooled and discharged from the reactor. During the course of reaction an inert atmosphere was maintained by bubbling nitrogen gas and the reactants were stirred at an rpm of 250. The resultant polyol had acid value of 1.4 milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample, hydroxyl value of 58.95 milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample and a viscosity of 6400 centipoise at 35 °C. Polyester Polyol Preparation for the ankle block :<br>
375 grams of polyethylene tercphthalate waste in the form of powder or chips, 625 grams of ethylene glycol and 2.24 grams of zinc acetate were weighed in the reaction vessel. The reaction vessel had provision for stirring the reactants, an opening for maintaining an inert atmosphere, provision for placing a thermowel to monitor the<br>
temperature of reaction and an opening to fix a reflux condenser. After weighing the reactants, the reaction assembly was setup. The reactants were heated initially to a temperature of 100 °C at the rate of 3 °C per minute and from 100 °C to 200 °C at the rale of 2 °C per minute. The reactants were held at the temperature of 200°C for 8 hours. The reactants were stirred continuously at an rpm of 350. At the end of 8 hours the reactants were cooled to ambient temperature 10 get the glycolysed product. 779 grams of adipic acid and 2.00 grams of para toluene sulphonic acid were added to this mixture and reaction assembly was again setup by replacing reflux condenser with dean-stark assembly which was filled with xylene. 25 ml xylene was added to the reaction mixture and heated from ambient temperature to a temperature of 100 °C at 3 °C per minute and from 100 °C to 180 °C at 1° per minute. The reactants were held at this temperature for 3 hours and then the temperature was raised to 200 °C at the rate of 1 °C per minute and held at this temperature for 4 hours to get the polyester polyol. Water of reaction was continuously removed during the course of reaction. During the course of reaction an inert atmosphere was maintained by bubbling nitrogen gas and the reactants were stirred at an rpm of 150. The polyester polyol thus obtained is coded PETB-2. Casting procedure for the one piece insert involves the use of three appropriate formulations each for the ankle, the hindfoot and the forefoot components. The hindfoot is cast first, using dummy inserts for the other two components. The dummy inserts arc then removed and formulations for the other two components are poured into the mold which contains hindfoot cast earlier. The complete one piece insert is removed from the mold after all the components have cured in the mold.<br>

The polyurethane components made as per the process of this invention offers following advantages :<br>
1.	The   forefoot  and  hindfoot  component  are  made   from   semi-rigid  and   flexible<br>
polyurethane foam to replace conventionally used laminated microcellular rubber<br>
block without compromising any physical property requirements. The ankle block<br>
component is made from rigid foam replacing the conventional wood.<br>
2.	The process of the present invention is less labor intensive.<br>
3.	The components of semi-rigid and flexible polyurelhane foams prepared using this<br>
process are standardized, offering advantages of consistent structure, dimensions and<br>
physical properties, thus ensuring product consistency.<br>
4.	The process of the present invention is amenable to tailor- making of materials with<br>
varying compressional characteristics to meet various needs of the patient.<br>
5.	The components made  from semi-rigid and  llcxihle polyuielhane loams are light<br>
weight as compared to the  conventionally  used microcellular rubber.  A weight<br>
reduction up to 30% can be achieved.<br>
6.	The components prepared are amenable to faster processing.   The foam preparation<br>
process can be adopted  for well  established  automatic  or semi-automatic  foam<br>
preparation techniques.<br>
7.	The components consisting of rigid,  semi-rigid  and  flexible polyurethane  foam<br>
prepared using this process is resistant to water.<br>
8.	The components based on rigid, semi-rigid and flexible polyurethane foam described<br>
in the said invention is a water blown, non-CFC foam and is thus, environmentally<br>
safe process.<br>
9.	Since all the components are prepared in a single mold, considerable time and labour<br>
is saving is ensured. The process also eliminates the need to tie the individual<br>
components with nylon tyre cords as  good  adhesion is observed between the<br>
individual components of the foot.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An improved process for the preparation of a one piece insert consisting of the<br>
components such as the ankle block,forefoot and the hindfoot useful in the<br>
