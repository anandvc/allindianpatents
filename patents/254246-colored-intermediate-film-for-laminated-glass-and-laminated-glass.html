SPECIFICATION<br>
COLOR INTERLAYER FILM FOR LAMINATED GLASS, AND LAMINATED GLASS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a color interlayer film<br>
for laminated glass, and laminated glass using said interlayer<br>
film for laminated glass.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, laminated glass obtained by inserting an<br>
interlayer film of a polyvinyl butyral resin between at least<br>
two glass plates is excellent in transparency, weather resistance,<br>
adhesion strength, and penetration resistance and further<br>
provided with a capability of preventing scattering of glass<br>
debris as basic properties , and accordingly has been used widely<br>
for window glass of automobiles and buildings.<br>
To heighten the beauty of laminated glass, laminated glass<br>
using a color interlayer film comprised of a polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin containing a coloring agent has also been used widely.<br>
However, there is a fear that the color interlayer film<br>
may turn its color to white if the film is put in highly humid<br>
atmosphere, resulting in discoloration of its original color<br>
into white. Further, the color interlayer film is desired to<br>
have high transparency and there arises a problem that if the<br>
color interlayer film has a light ray transmittance exceeding<br>
50%, even slight whitening discoloration tends to be noticeable.<br>
Therefore, it has been desired to develop a color interlayer<br>
film for laminated glass capable of preventing whitening of the<br><br>
2<br>
color interlayer film and maintaining the original color of the<br>
color interlayer film, and laminated glass using the interlayer<br>
film.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a color<br>
interlayer film for laminated glass capable of maintaining basic<br>
properties as the color interlayer film for laminated glass,<br>
excellent in the infrared ray shielding property, and resistant<br>
to whitening of the interlayer film part even in the case of<br>
moisture absorption, and laminated glass using the interlayer<br>
film. Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a color interlayer film resistant to whitening and capable of<br>
keeping the original color, regardless of high transparency,<br>
and maintaining low infrared ray transmittance, and also provide<br>
laminated glass using the interlayer film.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
Inventors of the present invention have made various<br>
investigations to accomplish the above-mentioned purposes and<br>
have found that the above-mentioned problems are all solved by<br>
adding a phosphoric acid ester compound at a ratio of 5 parts<br>
by weight or less to 100 parts by weight of a polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin in a resin composition containing the polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin, a coloring agent, and an infrared ray shielding agent,<br>
and accordingly have completed the invention based on further<br>
investigations.<br>
That is, the invention relates to:<br>
(1) a color interlayer film for laminated glass, comprising a<br><br>
3<br>
resin composition containing a polyvinyl acetal resin, a coloring<br>
agent, and an infrared ray shielding agent, characterized in<br>
that the resin composition further contains a phosphoric acid<br>
ester compound at a ratio of 5 parts by weight or less to 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin;<br>
(2)	the color interlayer film for laminated glass according to<br>
the above (1), wherein the phosphoric acid ester compound is<br>
a trialkyl phosphate, a trialkoxyalkyl phosphate, a triallyl<br>
phosphate, or an alkyl allyl phosphate;<br>
(3)	the color interlayer film for laminated glass according to<br>
the above (1), wherein the phosphoric acid ester compound is<br>
trioctyl phosphate, triisopropyl phosphate, tributoxyethyl<br>
phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, or isodecylphenyl phosphate;<br>
(4)	the color interlayer film for laminated glass according to<br>
any one of the above (1) to (3), wherein the content of the<br>
phosphoric acid ester compound is 0.001 to 5 parts by weight<br>
to 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin; and<br>
( 5 ) a laminated glass , characterized in that the color interlayer<br>
film for laminated glass according to any one of the above (1)<br>
to (4) intervenes between at least one pair of glass plates.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A color interlayer film for laminated glass of the present<br>
invention, and laminated glass using the film are excellent in<br>
an infrared ray shielding property and resistance against<br>
whitening while keeping basic properties as an interlayer film<br>
for laminated glasses or as a laminated glass. Also, the color<br>
interlayer film for laminated glass of the present invention<br>
and the laminated glass using the film have an effect which is<br><br>
4<br>
excellent in an infrared ray shielding property and preventive<br>
against whitening while durably keeping original color even if<br>
they are highly transparent.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The color interlayer film for laminated glass of the present<br>
invention is a color interlayer film for laminated glass,<br>
comprising a resin composition containing a polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin, a coloring agent, and an infrared ray shielding agent,<br>
and characterized in that the resin composition further contains<br>
a phosphoric acid ester compound at a ratio of 5 parts by weight<br>
or less to 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
The phosphoric acid ester compound to be used in the invention<br>
may include, for example, a trialkyl phosphate, a trialkoxyalkyl<br>
phosphate, a triallyl phosphate, and an alkyl allyl phosphate,<br>
and here, "alkyl" means an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms and "aryl" means an aromatic hydrocarbon group optionally<br>
substituted with a substituent (e.g. a phenyl group optionally<br>
substituted with a substituent such as a lower alkyl having 1<br>
to 4 carbon atoms and a lower alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms).<br>
More specific examples of the above-mentioned phosphoric acid<br>
ester compound are trioctyl phosphate, triisopropyl phosphate,<br>
tributoxyethyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, and<br>
isodecylphenyl phosphate.<br>
The content of the phosphoric acid ester compound is 5 parts<br>
by weight or less, usually 0.001 to 5 parts by weight, to 100<br>
parts by weight of the polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
The polyvinyl acetal resin to be used in the present invention<br>
is preferably those having an average acetalization degree of<br><br>
5<br>
40 to 75% by mole. If it is lower than 40% by mole, the<br>
compatibility with a plasticizer is decreased and it sometimes<br>
becomes difficult to mix a plasticizer in an amount needed for<br>
surely attaining penetration resistance. If it exceeds 75% by<br>
mole, the mechanical strength of the color interlayer film in<br>
the resultant laminated glass may be lowered, and it takes a<br>
long reaction time to obtain the resin, which is undesirable<br>
in terms of the process. It is more preferably 60 to 7 5% by<br>
mole and even more preferably 64 to 71% by mole.<br>
The above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal resin is used<br>
preferably as plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin with a<br>
plasticizer.<br>
With respect to the above-mentioned plasticized polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin, those which comprise 30% by mole or less of a vinyl<br>
acetate component are preferable. If it exceeds 30% by mole,<br>
blocking is easily caused at the time of producing the resin<br>
and it makes the production difficult. It is preferably 19%<br>
by mole or less.<br>
The above-mentioned plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
comprises a vinyl acetal component, a vinyl alcohol component,<br>
and a vinyl acetate component, and each amount of these components<br>
can be measured, for example, by " Polyvinyl Butyral Test Method",<br>
JIS K6782 and nuclear magnetic resonance method (NMR).<br>
In the case where the above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal resin<br>
is other than polyvinyl butyral resin, the amount of the remaining<br>
vinyl acetal component can be calculated by measuring each amount<br>
of the vinyl alcohol component and the vinyl acetate component<br>
and subtracting the amounts of both components from 100.<br>
The above-mentioned polyvinyl acetal resin can be produced<br><br>
6<br>
by a conventionally known method. For example, a method may<br>
be carried out as follows: a polyvinyl alcohol is dissolved in<br>
warm water and the resulting aqueous solution is kept at the<br>
predetermined temperature, for instance, at 0 to 95°C, preferably<br>
10 to 20°C and mixed with a necessary acid catalyst and an aldehyde<br>
to promote acetalization reaction under stirring condition.<br>
Next, the reaction temperature is raised to 70°C for aging to<br>
complete the reaction and after that, neutralization, water<br>
washing, and drying steps are carried out to obtain a powder<br>
of a polyvinyl acetal resin.<br>
As a polyvinyl alcohol which is served as the above-mentioned<br>
raw material, those having an average polymerization degree of<br>
500 to 5000 are preferable and those having an average<br>
polymerization degree of 1000 to 2500 are more preferable. If<br>
the average polymerization degree is lower than 500, the<br>
penetration resistance of the resultant laminated glass may be<br>
decreased in some cases. If the average polymerization degree<br>
exceeds 5000 , the f ormability of the resin film sometimes becomes<br>
difficult and the strength of the resin film may becomes too<br>
strong.<br>
Since it is preferable to set the amount of the vinyl acetate<br>
component of the obtained polyvinyl acetal resin to be not higher<br>
than 30% by mole, the saponification degree of the<br>
above-mentioned polyvinyl alcohol is preferably 70% by mole or<br>
higher. If it is lower than 70% by mole, the transparency and<br>
heat resistance of the resin may be decreased and also the<br>
reactivity may be decreased in some cases . It is more preferably<br>
95% by mole or higher. The average polymerization degree and<br>
saponif ication degree of the above-mentioned polyvinyl alcohol<br><br>
7<br>
can be measured, for example, according to "Polyvinyl Alcohol<br>
Test Method", JISK6726. The above-mentioned aldehyde includes<br>
preferably an aldehyde having 3 to 10 carbon atoms . If the number<br>
of carbon atoms of the aldehyde is less than 3, sufficient resin<br>
film formability cannot be obtained in some cases . If the number<br>
of carbon atoms of the aldehyde exceeds 10, the reactivity of<br>
acetalization is decreased, and blocks of the resin are easily<br>
formed during the reaction, resulting in a tendency of difficult<br>
resin synthesis.<br>
The above-mentioned aldehyde is not particularly limited<br>
and may include, for example, aliphatic, aromatic, and alicyclic<br>
aldehydes such as propionaldehyde, n-butyl aldehyde, isobutyl<br>
aldehyde, valeraldehyde, n-hexylaldehyde, 2-ethylbutyl<br>
aldehyde, n-heptyl aldehyde, n-octyl aldehyde, n-nonyl aldehyde ,<br>
n-decyl aldehyde, benzaldehyde, and cinnamaldehyde.<br>
Preferable aldehydes include, for example, aldehydes having 4<br>
to 8 carbon atoms, such as n-butyl aldehyde, n-hexyl aldehyde,<br>
2-ethylbutyl aldehyde, and n-octyl aldehyde. Since use of<br>
n-butyl aldehyde having 4 carbon atoms gives polyvinyl acetal<br>
resin whose use for resin films gives strong adhesion and<br>
excellent weather resistance, and makes the resin production<br>
easy and therefore, n-butyl aldehyde is more preferable. The<br>
aldehydes may be used alone, or two or more of them may be used<br>
in combination.<br>
As the infrared ray shielding agent to be used in the present<br>
invention, for example, metal fine particles or organic infrared<br>
ray absorbents can be exemplified.<br>
Examples of the above-mentionedmetal fine particles include<br>
various kinds of metals such as Sn, Ti, Si, Zn, Zr, Fe, Al, Cr,<br><br>
8<br>
Co, Ce, In, Ni, Ag, Cu, Pt, Mn, Ta, W, V as well as Mo; various<br>
kinds of oxides such as SnO2, TiO2, SiO2, ZrO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, A12O3,<br>

and AIN, or nitride oxides; sulfides such as ZnS; doped materials<br>
such as 9 wt% Sb2O3-SnO2 (ATO: manufactured by Sumitomo Osaka<br>
Cement, Co., Ltd.) and F-SnO2; and compounded oxides such as<br>
SnO2-10 wt% Sb2O3 and In2O3-5 wt% SnO2 (ITO: manufactured by-<br>
Mitsubishi Materials Corp.). Among them, ATO and ITO are<br>
particularly preferable since they satisfy the requirements for<br>
use for automobiles.<br>
The content of the above-mentioned infrared ray shielding<br>
agent is usually 0.001 to 10 parts by weight to 100 parts by<br>
weight of the polyvinyl acetal, although it depends on the type<br>
of the infrared ray shielding agents.<br>
The coloring agent to be used in the present invention is<br>
not particularly limited, and general purpose materials such<br>
as color toners, pigments, dyes and the like may be used. For<br>
example, as the color toners, green, black, blue, red toners<br>
can be exemplified, and they may be used alone or in the form<br>
of their mixture.<br>
Also, as the pigments, inorganic pigments such as carbon<br>
black, and titanium white; nitro- or nitroso-type pigments; azo<br>
type pigments; and phthalocyanine type pigments can be<br>
exemplified, and as the dyes, azo type dyes, anthraquinone type<br>
dyes, and phthalocyanine type dyes can be exemplified.<br>
The content of the above-mentioned coloring agent is not<br>
particularly limited, and may be approximately in an amount<br>
usually used for the color interlayer film for laminated glasses<br>
and may be properly determined in accordance with an aimed color.<br><br>
9<br>
The resin composition of the present invention may contain<br>
conventionally known additives such as an ultraviolet absorbent,<br>
a plasticizer, an antioxidant, a photostabilizer, and a<br>
surfactant other than the above-mentioned components.<br>
The above-mentioned ultraviolet absorbent may include, for<br>
example, benzotriazole derivatives such as<br>
2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-methylphenyl)benzotriazole, 2-(2'-hydroxy-<br>
3',5'-di-tert-butylphenyl)benzotriazole, 2-(2'-hydroxy-3'-<br>
tert-butyl-5'-methylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole, 2-(2 ' -<br>
hydroxy-3',5'-di-tert-butylphenyl)-5-chlorobenzotriazole,<br>
and 2-(2'-hydroxy-3',5'-di-tert-amylphenyl)benzotriazole;<br>
benzophenone derivatives such as 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone,<br>
2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone,	2-hydroxy-4-<br>
octoxybenzophenone, 2-hydroxy-4-dodecyloxybenzophenone,<br>
2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4, 4 ' -<br>
dimethoxybenzophenone, and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-<br>
sulfobenzophenone; and cyanoacrylate derivatives such as<br>
2-ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3'-diphenyl acrylate and<br>
ethyl-2-cyano-3,3'-diphenyl acrylate.<br>
As the above-mentioned plasticizer, there can be used a<br>
conventionally known plasticizer used for this kind of interlayer<br>
films, including plasticizers such as organic esters (e.g.<br>
monobasic acid esters and polybasic acid esters).<br>
Among the above-mentioned monobasic acid esters, preferable<br>
example is glycol type esters obtained by the reaction of<br>
triethylene glycol with an organic acid such as butyric acid,<br>
isobutyric acid, caproic acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid, heptanoic<br>
acid, n-octanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, pelargonic acid<br>
(n-nonanoic acid) , and decanoic acid. Additionally, esters of<br><br>
10<br>
tetraethylene glycol or tripropylene glycol with the<br>
above-mentioned organic acids may also be used.<br>
Preferable examples of the above-mentioned polybasic acid<br>
esters include esters of organic acids such as adipic acid,<br>
sebacic acid, and azelaic acid with straight chain or branched<br>
alcohols having 4 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
Specific examples of the above-mentioned organic ester type<br>
plasticizers include triethylene glycol di-2-ethylbutylate,<br>
triethylene glycol di-2-ethylhexoate, triethylene glycol<br>
dicaprylate, triethylene glycol di-n-octoate, triethylene<br>
glycol di-n-heptoate, and tetraethylene glycol di-n-heptoate<br>
and further dibutyl sebacate, diocty azelate, and<br>

and diethylene glycol dicaprylate can also be used as the<br>
plasticizer.<br>
The amount of the above-mentioned plasticizer is preferably<br>
20 to 70 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the polyvinyl<br>
acetal resin and more preferably 40 to 60 parts by weight. If<br>
it is less than 20 parts by weight, the penetration resistance<br>
of the laminated glass produced may be decreased, and if it exceeds<br>
70 parts by weight, the plasticizer may bleed to increase the<br>
optical strain and decrease the transparency and adhesion<br><br>
11<br>
property of the resin film in some cases.<br>
Although the above-mentioned antioxidant is not<br>
particularly limited, it includes, for example, a phenol type<br>
antioxidant such as tert-butylhydroxytoluene (trade name:<br>
Sumilizer BHT, manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.)<br>
and tetrakis-[methylene-3-(3',5'-di-tert-butyl-4'-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propionate]methane (Irganox 1010, manufactured<br>
by Ciba-Geigy Corp.).<br>
As the above-mentioned photostabilizer, hindered amine type<br>
ones such as Adeka Stab LA-57 (trade name) , manufactured by Asahi<br>
Denka Co., Ltd., can be exemplified.<br>
As the above-mentioned surfactant, for instance, sodium<br>
lauryl sulf ate and alkylbenzenesulf onic acid can be exemplified.<br>
(Production method)<br>
Although there is no particular limitation to a production<br>
method of the color interlayer film for laminated glass of the<br>
present invention, the color interlayer film can be produced<br>
by incorporating a coloring agent, an infrared ray shielding<br>
agent and a phosphoric acid ester compound, and optionally other<br>
additives into a polyvinyl acetal resin, kneading the mixture<br>
uniformly, and forming the kneaded product into a sheet-like<br>
resin film by an extrusion method, a calender method, a press<br>
method, a casting method, an inflation method or the like.<br>
In consideration of the minimum and necessary penetration<br>
resistance and weather resistance, the thickness of the entire<br>
color interlayer film for laminated glass of the present<br>
invention is, in its practical use, generally preferably in a<br>
range of 0.3 to 1.6 mm similar to the thickness of a common<br>
interlayer film for laminated glass.<br><br>
12<br>
As the glass plate to be used for the laminated glass, not<br>
only an inorganic transparent glass plate but also an organic<br>
transparent glass plate such as a polycarbonate plate and a<br>
poly(methyl methacrylate) plate may be used, though not<br>
particularly limited thereto.<br>
The type of the above-mentioned inorganic transparent glass<br>
plate is not particularly limited, and various kinds of inorganic<br>
glasses such as float plate glass, polished plate glass, figured<br>
glass, mesh-inserted plate glass, wire-inserted plate glass,<br>
heat beam-absorbing plate glass, and colored plate glass can<br>
be exemplified, and they may be used alone, or two or more of<br>
them may be used in combination. Further, an inorganic<br>
transparent glass plate and an organic transparent glass plate<br>
may be laminated. The thickness of the glass may properly be<br>
selected based on the applications and is not particularly<br>
limited.<br>
In order to produce the laminated glass of the present<br>
invention, a conventional method for the production of laminated<br>
glasses may be employed. For instance, a color interlayer film<br>
made of the resin film formed by the above-mentioned method is<br>
inserted between two transparent glass plates; the laminated<br>
product is put in a rubber bag and preliminarily adhered at about<br>
70 to 110°C under reduced pressure; and then actual adhesion<br>
is carried out at a temperature of about 120 to 150°C under a<br>
pressure of about 10 to 15 kg/cm2 by using an autoclave or a<br>
press to produce the laminated glass.<br>
In the production method of the laminated glass, the<br>
above-mentioned color interlayer film obtained by forming a film<br>
of a plasticized polyvinyl acetal resin may be inserted between<br><br>
13<br>
at least one pair of glass plates, and pressure-bonded under<br>
heating at a temperature of 60 to 100°C while vacuum degassing<br>
is simultaneously carried out under reduced pressure. More<br>
specifically, the production method may be carried out by placing<br>
a laminate product of a glass plate/color interlayer film/glass<br>
plate in a rubber bag and pressure-bonding the laminated product<br>
under heating at a temperature of about 60 to 100°C under a pressure<br>
of about 1 to 10 kg/cm2 for 10 to 30 minutes in, for example,<br>
an autoclave while carrying out vacuum-degassing at about -500<br>
to -700 mmHg for simultaneous degassing and adhesion.<br>
In this production method, the adhesion force between the<br>
color interlayer film and the glass can be adjusted within a<br>
proper desired range by, as described above, limiting the<br>
temperature within a temperature range of 60 to 100°C when<br>
pressure-bonded under heating, and properly setting various<br>
conditions such as pressure-bonding pressure, pressure bonding<br>
duration, and pressure reduction degree at the time of vacuum<br>
degassing within the above-mentioned ranges.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinafter, the invention will be described in more detail<br>
with reference to Examples, however it is not intended that the<br>
invention be limited to the illustrated Examples.<br>
(Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Example)<br>
A plasticizer-dispersed solution obtained by dispersing<br>
0.28 parts by weight of tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) and 0.014<br>
parts by weight of trioctyl phosphate in 10 parts by weight of<br>
triethyleneglycoldiethylhexanoate (3GO) ; and 29 parts by weight<br><br>
14<br>
of triethylene glycol diethylhexanoate (3G0), separately<br>
prepared, a color toner (the kinds of the colors used are as<br>
described in Table) , anantioxidant, and an ultraviolet absorbent<br>
in each amount described in the following Table 1 were added<br>
to 100 parts by weight of polyvinyl butyral resin, followed by<br>
mixing with three rolls. The resultant mixtures were formed<br>
by heat press to obtain polyvinyl butyral resin sheets (color<br>
interlayer films) with a thickness of 0.76 mm.<br><br><br><br>
16<br>
(Test example)<br>
According to the following test methods, haze values of<br>
the polyvinyl butyral resin sheets obtained in the<br>
above-mentioned Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Example as they<br>
were or while being sandwiched with clear glass and at the same<br>
time light transmittance of the resin sheets were measured. The<br>
test results are shown in the following Tables 2 and 3.<br>
(Test method)<br>
1.	Measurement of the haze value:<br>
The measurement was carried out by using an integrating<br>
turbidimeter after 24 hours from the time when color interlayer<br>
films were immersed in water at 23°C as they were or while being<br>
sandwiched with clear glass.<br>
2.	Measurement of the light transmittance:<br>
The following measurement and evaluation were carried out<br>
for the resultant laminated glasses.<br>
The transmittance was measured for the light with wavelength<br>
in a range of 340 to 2100 nm by a spectrophotometer ( Self-recording<br>
type 340 Model, manufactured by Hitachi Ltd. ) and visible light<br>
transmittance, sunlight transmittance Ts 2100, color tone and<br>
the like were measured according to JIS R3106.<br><br>

As can be understood from the above Tables 2 and 3, even<br>
if the color interlayer films of the present invention are color<br>
interlayer films having a light transmittance exceeding 50%,<br>
they are remarkably excellent in the haze values as compared<br>
with that of the comparative film, and preventive against<br>
whitening. Also, it can be understood that even if the color<br>
interlayer films of the present invention are color interlayer<br>
films having a light transmittance exceeding 50%, they can keep<br>
low infrared ray transmittance since infrared rays are remarkably<br>
shielded by the infrared ray shielding agent.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The laminate glass produced by using the color interlayer<br>
film for laminated glass in accordance with the present invention<br>
is useful for window glass of automobiles and buildings.<br><br>
