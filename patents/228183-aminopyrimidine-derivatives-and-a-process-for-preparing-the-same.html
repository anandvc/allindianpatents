EXAMPLES<br><br>
lH-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiple!; br, broad) and number of protons. Electron Spray Ionization (ESI) mass<br><br>
spectra were recorded on a Hewlett Packkard 5989A mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry results are reported as the ratio of mass over charge. Preparative HPLC purifications were performed with XTerraâ¢RP1819x150mm columns, using acetonitirle/water or MeOH/water as eluent systems. All reagents, starting materials and intermediates utilized in these examples are available from commercial sources or are readily prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
Aminopyrimidines of the formula XI were conveniently prepared by palladium(O)-catalyzed cross coupling reactions (Suzuki- or Stille-type) outlined as general Methods A to E in Scheme 1. These methods are illustrated below by representative Examples 1 to 5. The boronic acids are commercially available or were prepared in situ and used as such without further purification.<br><br><br><br><br>
To a stirred and cooled (ice bath) solution of 3-thiophen-2-yl-propionic acid methyl ester (2 g, 11.75 mmol) in 30 ml of THF was added MeMgBr (3M solution in ether, 11.7 ml, 35.1 mmol). Stirring was continued for 2 hours. Then, the mixture was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride solution (50 ml) and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated. Yield: 1.9 g (95%) of a pale yellow oil which was clean enough for further use.<br><br>
A solution of 2-methyl-4-thiophen-2-yl-butan-2-ol (630 mg, 3.7 mmol) in 10 ml of THF was treated with LDA (4.6 ml of 2M solution in THF/heptane/ethylbenzene, 9.2 mmol) at -78 Â°C under nitrogen and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. Then, trimethylborate (1 ml, 9.2 mmol) was added in one portion and the cooling bath was removed. After 15 minutes, the mixture was<br><br>
quenched with 50 ml of saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted twice with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine and evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature. This crude boronic acid was redissolved in 10 ml of DME and added to a stirred suspension 2,4-dichloro-pyrimidine (275 mg, 1.85 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (64 mg, 0.037 mmol), 20 ml of DME and 5 ml of a 10% solution of sodium bicarbonate. This mixture was then kept at reflux (100 Â°C heat bath) for 90 minutes. After cooling, most of the DME was evaporated and the crude was partitioned between water and EtOAc.

The Agents of the Invention, as defined above, e.g., of formula I, II and III particulariy as exemplified, in free or pharmaceutical1H acceptable acid addition salt form, exhibit pharmacological activity and are useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. for therapy, in the treatment of diseases and conditions as hereinafter set forth.<br>
In particular Agents of the Invention are potent inhibitors of IKK and thus have potential for pharmaceutical use for treatment of diseases and medical conditions mediated by IKK. In particular, as inhibitors of IKK, the Agents of the invention can act to inhibit or even block NFKB activated gene expression and thus act to inhibit production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1, and also to potentially block the effects of these cytokines on their target cells. These and other pharmacological activities of the Agents of the Invention as may be demonstrated in standard test methods, for example as described below:<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES - IKB kinase assay and IKB degradation assay<br>
Expression and purification of recombinant IKBOE. substrate. The cDNA encoding human IKBCX was cloned into the vector pET17b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A.)<br><br>
and recombinant IKBCX protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 DE3 pLysS (Novagen, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A.) according to the suppliers specifications and purified as follows (all steps at 0-4 Â°C). 3 g of wet cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, containing 1 mM DTE, and sonicated on ice (3 x 1 min). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged in a Beckman JA-20 rotor (Beckmann Instruments, Fullerton, CA, U.S.A.) at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes and the IKBCX protein was precipitated from the supernatant by addition of 15% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. After incubation for 15 minutes and centrifugation in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 14,000 rpm for 12 minutes, the pellet was dissolved in 20 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl at pH 8.0, containing 1 mM DTE, and loaded onto a 35 ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl. iKBa-containing fractions, which eluted between 0.55 and 0.6 M salt, were pooled, frozen by dripping the solution into liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 Â°C. Typical yields were 2-7 mg of pure protein per liter of E. coli cell culture.<br>
Purification of IKB kinase. IKB kinase was purified from TNFa-stimulated HeLa cells. HeLa cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 446 mg/1 L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 50 1HM mercaptoethanol. For 12 hours prior to stimulation, the cells were starved in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 50 \iM mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/ml penicilline (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) and 100 ng/ml streptomycine (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland). The starved cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml TNFa for 5 min at 37 Â°C, immediately chilled to 4Â°C and collected by centrifugation. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4Â°C or on ice. HeLa cells were suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, containing 10 mM KG, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTE and 100 fig/ml PMSF) and lysed by 20 strokes in a dounce homogenizer with a pistil B. Centrifugation in a Beckman JA-20 rotor for 30 minutes at 12,000 rpm and then in a Beckman Ti 45 rotor at 42,000 rpm for 2 hours yielded the post-ribosomal supernatant from which the proteins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate in a stepwise manner: addition of ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 8% (w/v), incubation for 15 min and centrifugation in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 14,000 rpm was followed by a second precipitation step at 31% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. After an incubation period of 15 min and centrifugation in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 14,000 rpm the latter pellet was dissolved in 50 ml of 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0,<br><br>
containing 1 mM DTE, and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The protein solution was then loaded onto a 300 ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column which was equilibrated with the above dialysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0-1 M NaCl. IKB kinase activity, which eluted from the column between 300 mM and 350 mM NaCl, was concentrated by ultrafiltration with Amicon PM 10 filters (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA, U.S.A.). The concentrated protein solution was then passed over a Sephacryl S300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) developed in 25 mM Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTE. The IKB kinase-containing fractions were pooled, loaded onto a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15-0.5 M NaCl in 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0,1 mM DTE. Purified IkB kinase was stored frozen at -80 Â°C until further use.<br>
IKB kinase activity assay. Nunc-ImmunoPlates MaxiSorp (Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) were coated for 2 hours at room temperature with 50 jal/well of 25 |iM IKBCX in 50 mM Tris/HCl at pH 8.0,1 mM DTE. After blocking for 1 hour with a solution of 2 % (w/v) BSA in PBS buffer, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20. The kinase reaction was done in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.0, containing 10 mM MgCk and 1 mM DTE. The substrate ATP was used at a concentration of 10 |iM and the reaction started by the addition of the purified IKB kinase. For measuring the inhibition of IKB kinase by compounds, the test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added to the enzyme reaction prior to addition of the kinase. After 20-90 minutes at room temperature the reaction was terminated by washing with PBS/0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20. The phosphorylated kBa was then detected using a phospho-specific IKBCX (Ser32) antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, U.S.A., cat. # 9041S) in combination with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CAj U.S.A.) and employment of BM Blue POD substrate (Roche Diagnostics AG, Basel, Switzerland) as follows. The first, phospho-specific IKBCX antibody was diluted 1:1500 with PBS, 2 % (w/v) BSA, 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20 and added to the wells. After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the plates were washed 5 times with PBS containing 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20. The second antibody, diluted 1:3000 with PBS, 2 % (w/v) BSA, 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20, was then added to the wells and the plates allowed to incubate for 1 hour at room temperature. Following 5 washing steps with PBS, 2 % (w/v) BSA, 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20, 50 1H1 BM Blue POD substrate was added to each well. The color<br><br>
reaction was stopped by addition of 50 1H1 of 2.25 M H2SO4 and the absorbance of the wells measured at 450 nm versus 650 nm. Each compound was tested twice in duplicate and calculation of IC50 values were done using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, U.S.A.)- Agents of the invention typically have IQo values when measured in the above assay in the range from 20 to 1000 nM.<br>
IKBCX degradation assay. THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium with Glutamax-I (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicilline and 100 |ig/ml streptomycine. For the assay, the cells were transferred to 96-well plates (Nunc, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland, cat. #245128) at a density of 600 000 cells/well and stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFa for 12 minutes at room temperature. For measuring the inhibition of TNFct-stimulated IKBCX degradation by compounds, the test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added to the cell suspension prior to addition of TNFa. Following incubation, the plates were centrifixged at 1200 rpm in a Heraeus Megafiige 2.OR (Heraeus AG, Zuerich, Switzerland), the supernatants discarded, and the cell pellet dissolved in 50 1Hil/well Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland, cat. #161-0737) supplemented with 5 % (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The concentration of IKBCX in the individual samples was analyzed by Western blotting using NOVEX 10 % Tris-Glycine gels (Invitrogen, Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) and the ECL+Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The primary antibody was an anti-IxBa antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A., cat. # sc-371) diluted 1:1000 and the secondary antibody a goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-cojugated antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland, cat. #172-1019). Each compound was tested in duplicate and estimation of IC50 values were done based on densitometric scanning or visual inspection. Agents of the invention typically have IC50 values when measured in the above assay in the range from 0.5 to 30 \iM.<br>
Assay for Inhibition of TNF-a release from hPBMCs<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) are prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using ficoll-hypaque density separation according to the method of Hansell et al., J. Imm. Methods (1991) 145:105. and used at a concentration of 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS. Cells are incubated with serial dilutions of the test compounds for 30 minutes at<br><br>
37Â°C prior to the addition of IFNg (100 U/ml) and LPS (5 mg/ ml) and subsequently further incubated for three hours. Incubation is terminated by centrifiigation at 1400 RPM for 10 min. TNF-a in the supernatant is measured using a commercial ELIS A (Innotest hTNFa, available from Innogenetics N.V., Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Agents of the Invention are tested at concentrations of from 0 to 10 mM. Exemplified Agents of the Ivention typically suppress TNF release in this assay with IC50 values raging from about 100 nM to about 3000 nM or less when tested in this assay.<br>
Assay for Inhibition of TNF-a Production in LPS stimulated mice<br>
Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a rapid release of soluble tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) into the periphery. This model is be used to analyse prospective blockers of TNF release in vivo.<br>
LPS (20 mg/kg) is injected i.v. into OF1 mice (female, 8 week old). One (1) hour later blood is withdrawn from the animals and TNF levels are analysed in the plasma by an ELISA method using an antibody to TNF-a. Using 20 mg/kg of LPS levels of up to 15 ng of TNF-a / ml plasma are usually induced. Compounds to be evaluated are given either orally or s.c. 1 to 4 hours prior to the LPS injection. Inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-release is taken as the readout.<br>
Agents of the Invention typically inhibit TNF production to the extent of up to about 50% or more in the above assay when administered at 30 mg/kg p.o., i.v. or s.c<br>
