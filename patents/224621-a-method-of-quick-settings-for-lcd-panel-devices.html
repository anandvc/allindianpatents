				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention in general relates to multi function peripheral devices (MFP) which have LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) panel and have complex Ul (User Interface) settings. Particularly, this invention focuses on efficient, easy and convenient configuration and usage of these devices through smart settings of user friendly LCD panel user interface. More particularly this invention encompasses a method of quick settings for LCD panel devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently, MFP device users configure and use the device by browsing and choosing the settings on the LCD panel user interface. MFP devices involve complex user interface settings which are not retained for later use once the task or job is completed.<br>
The existing art for configuring devices through panel settings via user interface has certain limitations. It will not be possible to store bulk data like sample or test fax if the user intends to utilize the MFP memory to save the same. A method would be needed to transfer the data from MFP to PC if the user wants to save the data on the PC side.<br>
Extra memory is needed if the user's intention is to save the data on the MFP itself and does not want to use the PC. The amount of data stored on the MFP or device depends on the number of users using it. The best solution to circumvent this problem is to utilize the PC memory.<br>
Firstly the limitation comes when the user tries to store the bulk data not the settings. If his/her idea is to save the bulk data then he can use PC or MFP with extra extended memory. This limitation comes when the user wants to save huge data for particular use for any reason. But storing of data is usually not practiced. Storing of data means storing headers or footers of letter pad which will be send along with the fax or printed with the document or a fax which he<br><br>
wants to send as a acknowledgement when some activity is over or user defined.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method of quick settings for LCD panel devices which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention is to make the complex LCD Ul settings user friendly and to store them with reference name for quick settings for later use.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide some standard settings (Vendor defined / User defined) for most used complex jobs for non technical user.<br>
It is another object of the invention to increase the convenience ratio which is a measure of the ease of use of any device. Higher the convenience ratio, easier is the usage and hence easy to configure the device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of saving the user defined and common settings for configuration and usage of LCD panel / MFP devices through Quick settings with associated name by means of a new "Quick settings" key.<br>
The present invention shall comprise some predefined features that could only be saved with Name on the device. The settings done on the MFP would be saved in a structure or some variables with a Name when the user selects the quick setting option. Later whenever the user wants to again bring that MFP to that state he has to browse the menu which will show all quick settings stored on that machine and on selecting the quick setting which is stored as a name on the machine, the machine can be configured with those settings.<br><br>
This invention will enable the users to save the settings with reference names and use them later for configuration of the devices with quickness and ease. Each user can configure MFP with his/her personnel settings by simply choosing particular Quick Setting which has been stored in past with a name.<br>
This feature will become more valuable if MFP is shared between many users and each user wants their settings whenever they logon to the machine. Settings could be:<br>
?	Change in locale.<br>
?	Time format.<br>
?	Date format.<br>
?	Default paper / media settings etc.<br>
Accordingly this invention relates to a method of quick settings for LCD panel devices wherein setting of the quick settings is done by name and ID, quick settings can be stored with the name and ID in flash memory as well as in SRAM, setting or configuration can be selected by the user and the information stored for that quick setting can be read from the memory;<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and the detailed description as follows.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a MFP system for present invention which explains the interaction among different modules.<br>
Figure 2 shows a functional block diagram of the operation of the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many times there are situations where some settings are to be configured repeatedly for particular type of job. These settings can be stored with reference Names as "Quick Settings" and later merely by choosing the "Quick settings" from the menu the intended settings can be restored in the quickest possible time.<br>
Broadly there are two types of settings. One is User Specific and second is common or general settings which are to be used by the common users. Settings are stored in MFP memory by name and can again be retrieved by selecting that "Quick Settings" name.<br>
These settings are generally configured through device panel. There is a provision for saving these settings from Web Ul provided for that device. The settings can be stored through device panel as well as through Web Ul using computer.<br>
Settings could be stored on the PC side if they are not to be exposed for other users or the memory allotted for storing the settings is insufficient. This condition could occur if the numbers of users are more which is typical of many organizations or the user wants to store bulk data.<br>
Generally MFP module consist of Ul module, NIC Module, LCD and Key Board drivers, shared memory along with device memory.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the interaction among various modules of the MFP. MFP module consist of Ul module 10, NIC Module 12, LCD 22 and Key Board 24 and their drivers 20, shared memory 14 along with device memory 18. Above all it contains a user interface block 16.<br>
Web based Ul settings 10 would be exchanged using shared memory 14 via network interface card 12. Settings which are configured on the MFP would be passed to the PC using shared memory 14 and can be stored with a user<br><br>
defined name. If the user doesn't want to store bulk settings then the settings done on the MFP would be stored on the MFP itself by Name i.e. on device memory 18. This exchange would take through shared memory or could be done through LPT or USB if the PC and MFP are attached to local intranet.<br>
Fig. 2 explains the different blocks giving a clear picture of the modules according to the functions. MFP module consist of Ul module 210, NIC Module 212, LCD 222 and Key Board 224 and their drivers 220, shared memory 214 along with device memory 218. Above all it contains a user interface block 216.<br>
Settings which are configured on the MFP would be passed to the PC using shared memory 214 and can be stored with a user defined name. Setting configured by using web based Ul 210 could be stored on the MFP by configuring the machine and invoking or pressing the quick setting menu or button. Web based Ul settings 210 would be exchanged using shared memory 214 via network interface card 212. If the user doesn't want to store bulk settings then the settings done on the MFP would be stored on the MFP itself by Name i.e. on device memory 218. There would be an option to transfer the bulk data to the PC for particular quick settings. In this case there would be an option on the MFP menu which will prompt the user to select the location to store the settings i.e. Device memory (MFP) 218 or on Hard Disk (PC) 215.<br>
There are two methods to set the quick settings:<br>
o Direct button key method - A dedicated button may be created which will prompt the user the name/nick name of the quick set.<br>
o Selecting "Quick Settings" from menu - In this method a menu will be added to access the quick settings; it could be sub-menu or main menu.<br>
There would be defined set of settings in the machine which would be stored in Quick Settings. A structure will be maintained in which variables will be set<br><br>
according to the settings done by user. By default all flags will be zero which will be the default option of that particular menu. RAM will be updated with the flash memory (non-volatile memory) when backup is over or when machine is rebooted.<br>
There could be a provision to store the earlier settings of the machine in default Quick Settings before selecting the particular user defined quick settings. After the user finishes his job by selecting his Quick Settings the earlier state of the machine will be returned. This feature will be provided with On / Off flag which will enable the user to decide whether to return to original state or remain in new state of the machine.<br>
Further there could be two types of Quick Settings :<br>
o   Vendor defined - These settings will  be supplied with the<br>
machine; o   User defined - Quick settings which will be configured by user<br>
according to his/her or organization need.<br>
For a particular Quick Settings there will be a provision to store the last 25 dialed and received numbers or as many designed by the developer so that when the user configures particular quick settings he can browse the history for that quick settings.<br>
Some examples<br>
For configuring Scan to Email feature which is used to send the mail directly to the Email address without using personnel computer, the user has to set and browse 6 to 7 settings/menus but if Quick Settings is used then it can be performed in 2 steps if the settings are saved in Quick Settings form. The convenience ratio is 3:1 i.e. user configures the machine in one third of the steps used in the normal case.<br><br>
Another example: For Copying functionality the, user has to configure the machine for 5 to 6 menus (Collated, Duplex, Orientation, Edge etc) but with Quick Setting feature, this can be done in 2 steps. Hence the convenience ratio is 2.5:1.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The setting or configuration chosen by the user will be stored in a flash memory as well as in SRAM whenever the dedicated button provided on the panel is pressed or the menu which is used to store the quick settings is selected.<br>
In the same manner whenever that particular Quick Settings is selected the information stored for that quick setting will be read from the memory and the machine will be configured accordingly.<br>
The User Interface menu will have a separate menu for storing the quick settings with name and ID.<br>
Settings will be stored in flash memory as well as in SRAM so that settings can be restored when needed and even when machine is rebooted.<br>
Administrator can use this feature to configure the MFP device according to the organization need to provide a standard across the organization. Settings could be:<br>
o   Mandatory numbers to track the fax sent/received.<br>
o   Standard reserved locations for storing telephone numbers (in the<br>
form of Speed / Group Dial/ One Touch locations) o   Developing Quick settings which can be used across organization as a standard.<br>
Quick Settings can be shared between various users. Suppose a user one has configured the MFP with complex settings and saves it with name as "Quick<br><br>
Settings". Then another user can use the same quick settings if he has been given permission to use the same. In other words if the administrator configures the device with some particular settings then he can allow the other users to use the same.<br>
•	Some complex necessary and tedious settings needed for every job, can be stored with a common name in form of Quick Settings and other extra settings can be developed on it.<br>
•	Some mandatory settings like IP address, Port number, Machine name and ID can be put in one Quick Settings and can be called whenever basic settings are to be reconfigured.<br>
