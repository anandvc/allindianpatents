				<td>The present invention relates to a connecting means for con¬necting several individual components, in particular for con¬necting two electrotechnical individual components or electric appliances. Such a connecting means consists of a connecting clip connecting two individual components with each other, a connecting clip seat which is provided at one of the individual components to be connected and an engaging seat which is like¬wise provided at one of the individual components to be con¬nected so as to allow engagement with a connecting clip for connecting two individual components. Thus, a connecting clip/connecting clip seat system is obtained, which represents the connecting means.<br>
The installation of electrotechnical components often requires the connection of two individual components since either they cooperate or a large number of them must be installed side-by-side in switch boxes etc.<br>
However, it shall be emphasized that the use is not restricted to the connection of electrotechnical elements alone. Rather is this field described as an example, since the presently pre¬ferred embodiments belong to this field.<br>
For example, it is a common thing in electric engineering to connect two individual components by spring clips. Such a spring clip consists of a spring steel which is spirally rolled at both ends. These two rolled end portions are then inserted into appropriate recesses provided in the individual components to be connected, the dimensions, being such that the insertion is only possible by applying a certain pressure, so that the spring clip virtually catches with the recesses so as to ensure a reliable connection, /md<br><br>
However, the assembly of this spring clip construction is dif¬ficult and requires a lot of manual skill, which results in a longer assembly time and, consequently, higher production costs. Besides, fixing members (e. g. rings or discs) are re¬quired between the appliances to be connected, which cause ad¬ditional expense. Moreover, the spring clip can easily be lost as it is a small separate member which is carried loose until assembly.<br>
Therefore, the problem of the present invention is to create a connecting means which provides a detachable connection between individual components in a simple manner.<br>
Further, a connecting means shall be as multifunctional as pos¬sible so as to be connectable to diverse connecting elements.<br>
This problem is solved by a connecting clip according to claim 1, a connecting clip seat according to claim 7 and an engaging seat according to claim 9.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention represent the subject matters of the subclaims.<br>
In the following, some advantages of the connecting means ac¬cording to the invention are indicated.<br>
The connecting clip can no longer be lost in that the swivel foot of the connecting clip is pre-assembled in one of the in¬dividual components to be connected and is supported so that it cannot drop out. Due to the advantageous design that the con¬necting clip is supported in an undercut groove in one individ¬ual component to be connected in a manner to be movable from the right edge of one side to the left edge of this side, only one connecting clip is necessary which allows the connection of an individual component to be connected optionally on the right<br><br>
side or on the left side, depending on the fact on which side the connection is needed.<br>
By providing a limiting peg at the rod of the connecting clip, which exceeds beyond the thickness of the connecting clip, the anchor stock of the connecting clip cannot completely disappear in the undercut groove within the component to be connected. Further, when clamping together the two components to be con¬nected, the limiting peg can serve for guiding the movement.<br>
The connecting clip can be preferably designed so that it can be easily handled, so that the connecting means can also be easily detached again. This is effected e. g. by an appropriate design of the anchor stock, e. g. by providing a notch in the middle of the anchor stock, into which, upon disassembly of the appliance, e. g. the point of a screw driver can be put and the connecting clip can consequently be easily detached.<br>
The connecting clip seat can be designed in a molding process so that it is provided, on at least two assembly sides, with a rectangular support for the swivel foot of the connecting clip as well as with an undercut for receiving the catch section of the anchor stock of the connecting clip so as to allow the con¬nection of a further component. This renders the connecting means multifunctional, because, according to demand, it may be used as a connecting clip seat for receiving the catch section of the anchor stock of the connecting clip or as a swivel foot receptacle of the connecting clip. This simplifies the produc¬tion of the connecting means and production costs can be re¬duced.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, it is possible to design the connecting clip seat so as to be multifunctional. This allows an optional use of different connecting clips in order to connect two components.<br><br>
In the following, the invention shall be explained more pre¬cisely by describing preferred embodiments and by referring to the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a connecting clip.<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of two individual components to be connected and of the connecting clip, both individual compo¬nents being represented partially broken off and one of the in¬dividual components besides being represented only partially.<br>
Figure 3 shows the same view as figure 2, the connecting clip, however, being in its caught state.<br>
Figure 4 shows another perspective representation of figure 3.<br>
Figure 5 shows a connecting clip which is used in a second em¬bodiment .<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective representation of the connecting clip shown in figure 5 and of -a connecting clip seat according to a second embodiment.<br>
Figure 7 is a sectional representation partially showing two components to be connected, which are connected by the connect¬ing clip according to figure 5.<br>
In the following, explanations as to the first embodiment are given by referring to the figures 1 to 4.<br>
By referring to figure 1, the connecting clip 1 is now ex¬plained more precisely.<br>
The connecting clip 1 has a substantially anchor-shaped con¬struction, comprising a rod 3 as well as an anchor stock 4 which extends at right angles across one end of the rod. The rod 3 as well as the anchor stock 4 have a flat design and a<br><br>
rectangular cross-section. At the other end of the rod, oppo¬site to the anchor stock 4, there is a swivel foot 2 which is shaped as a round shaft portion which laterally projects left and right of the rod 3. The rotational axis of the swivel foot is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the anchor stock 4. Besides, the rotational axis of the swivel foot 2 is aligned at right angles with respect to the longitudinal extension of the of the anchor stock 4. Approximately in the middle of the rod 3, a peg 5 is provided which extends in parallel with the rotational axis of the swivel foot 2 and, consequently, like¬wise, laterally projects a little from the rod 3. The anchor stock 4 has a slightly curved bellied catch section 4a which is bent towards the rod 3. During assembly, this catch section 4a serves as a catch element. Centrally, at the top of the anchor stock, on its side turned away from the rod, a notch 6 is pro¬vided.<br>
As can be seen in figure 2, the reference numerals 13 and 14 refer to two components to be connected, wherein e. g. the com¬ponent 14 is the main device and the component 13 is an auxil¬iary device which has to be mounted on the main device.<br>
In each of the two components 13 and 14 to be connected, a con¬necting clip seat as well as two recesses 11 provided on the left and on the right in the connecting clip seat are provided.<br>
In the following, the connecting clip seat is described.<br>
As shown by figure 2, on one side of the component 13 and 14, a groove 7 extending over the entire lateral length is provided. The groove 7 is open at both side ends. In the groove, an un¬dercut 9 is provided, so that the groove 7 together with the undercut 9 forms a kind of guide groove in which the swivel foot 2 of the connecting clip 1 is accomodated and supported so as to allow a sliding shift to the left and the right. While the rod 3 is guided in the groove 7 the swivel foot 2 is lo¬cated in the undercut 9. The anchor stock 4 is outside the<br><br>
groove 7. Due to the fact that the swivel foot 2 is guided in the undercut 9 it is impossible that the connecting clip drops out of the groove, so that it can no longer be lost. The peg 5 avoids that the anchor stock 4 inadvertently gets inside the component 13 through the groove 7 since, then, it would no longer be accessible from outside.<br>
In the following, the engaging recess in the components 13 and 14 is described.<br>
Same serves for receiving and holding the catch section 4a of the connecting clip 1. For this purpose, inside each of the components 13, 14, a recess 11 is formed on the left and right side on the side of the groove 7. This recess 11 has a shape substantially corresponding to that of the catch section 4a of the anchor stock. I. e. it consists of a contact surface which extends inside the component 13, 14 approximately perpendicu¬larly to the extension of the groove 7. At the end of this con¬tact surface, there -is an undercut which approximately corre¬sponds to the shape of the bellied catch section 4a of the con¬necting clip 1. When assembling both components to be connected the catch section 4a can catch with the recess 11 and engage with the undercut. Depending on the design of the recess and the adjustment of the material flexibility of the connecting clip, the catch function can be set from very hard and diffi¬cult to be detached again to very easy and easily detachable.<br>
In the following, the connection of both components 13, 14 by the connecting clip 1 is described.<br>
Figure 2 shows a representation where the connecting clip 1 is arranged in a component 13 to be connected and where it is in its open position. The component 14 to be connected to the com¬ponent 13 is in a contact position in which both components shall be connected to each other. More precisely, the swivel foot 2 of the connecting clip 1 is arranged in a rectangular pivot bearing 12 of the one component 13 to be connected. For<br><br>
an easier understanding, the upper cover of the component 13 to be connected, in which the connecting clip is provided, is par¬tially broken off, so that the connecting clip is entirely visible. In reality, of course, the rod 3 of the connecting clip 1 is located, together with its swivel foot 2, inside the component 13 to be connected and only a part of the rod 3 and the anchor stock 4 project from the component 13 to be con¬nected through a slit-like opening of the groove 7. The con¬necting clip 1 is rotatable around its swivel foot 2. If, now, the connecting clip 1 is rotated around the swivel foot 2 in the direction of the arrow A of figure 2 the connecting clip is forced into engagement with the second component 14 to be con¬nected, as shown in figure 3. In figure 3, the connecting clip 1 is in its closed position.<br>
As shown by the figures 2 and 3, the two components 13 and 14 are designed equally with regard to the design for receiving a connecting clip. This means, one is completely free to option¬ally force the connecting clip 1 of the component 13, for con¬nection with the component 14, into engagement with the corre¬sponding seat of the component 14 and, vice-versa, one could force a connecting clip provided at the component 14 into en¬gagement with the seat provided in the component 13. The refer¬ence numeral 12 refers to a swivel foot support which serves for supporting the swivel foot 2 in two directions, the con¬necting clip I remaining rotatable around the axis of the swivel foot 2. The swivel foot support 12 is formed by a wall portion 12a and a further wall portion 12b. The wall portion 12a is not as high as the wall portion 12b. The wall portion 12a is formed in that the undercut 9 of the groove 7 stops be¬fore the end of the groove. The wall portion 12a is necessary to enable the swivel foot 2 to rest thereon, whereas the rod 3 can pass over this wall portion 12a, so that the connecting clip 1 can be swung so as to be able to engage with the compo¬nent 14 to be connected, anyway (see figures 2 and 3). The wall portion 12b is provided as high that also the rod 3 rests thereon, so that the rotation of the connecting clip is limited<br><br>
by this wall portion. This ensures that the connecting clip cannot swing further inside, where it might no longer be acces¬sible for the assembler.<br>
Following the wall portion 12b, at right angles to it, there is the recess 11 including the undercut which is designed so as to correspond to a catch side of the catch section 4a of the an¬chor stock 4 of the connecting clip 1. If, now, the connecting clip 1 is rotated around the rotational axis of its swivel foot 2, as shown in the figures 2 and 3, the connecting clip can be rotated until a contact surface of its rod 3 rests on the wall portion 12b and the curved catch section 4a catches with the undercut of the recess 11. This state is shown in figure 3. In this state, in the embodiment as described, the auxiliary de¬vice and the main device 13, 14 are rigidly connected to each other. The dimensions of the connecting clip in combination with an appropriate selection of the dimensions of the recess 11 are chosen in the component to be connected so that, upon introduction, the connecting clip braces the two components to be connected with each other.<br>
As shown in figure 3, the catch section 4a of the anchor stock of the connecting clip arranged opposite to the caught catch section 4a extends into the groove 7 of the auxiliary device 14, through which the connecting clip 1 could be swung inwards. Due to this, the connecting clip remains accessible from out¬side even in its closed position, at least for an auxiliary tool such as a small screw driver. Due to this, the connection of both components can be detached again. Consequently, the auxiliary device can be easily attached to the main device and can just as easily be detached from it again.<br>
As shown e. g. in the figures 1 and 2, in the middle of the connecting clip's anchor stock 4, opposite to the rod 3, a V-¬shaped notch 6 is provided. This notch 6 allows an even easier detachment of the connecting clip by means of an auxiliary tool in order to move the catch sections 4a caught with the under-<br><br>
cuts 11 from the closed position to the open position. E. q. a small screw driver can easily engage in the notch and, thus, force out the connecting clip.<br>
As further disclosed e. g. by figure 4, where the auxiliary de¬vice is completely shown (i. e. without parts being broken off) , the connecting clip is freely shiftable within the groove 7 from the right to the left and vice-versa, so that it can be optionally shifted from one swivel foot support 12 on one side to another swivel foot support on the other side. This enables a main device 14 to be mounted on the auxiliary device 13 op¬tionally on the left and/or on the right side. This ensures a maximum flexibility upon assembly.<br>
As further shown by figure 2, the peg 5 disposed at the con¬necting clip 1 is provided to avoid that the connecting clip inadvertently completely disappears in the groove 7 of the com¬ponent 13 to be connected when the connecting clip is somewhere in the middle of the groove 7 in that the peg 5 abuts against the walls forming the groove 7 of the component 13. This design prevents that the anchor stock 4 of the connecting clip is com¬pletely swung inwards into the component, this means that its turning capacity is more strictly limited in the central range, i. e. not in the lateral range where the groove 7 is open and allows a swiveling of the connecting clip I until the rod 3 rests on the contact surface 12b,<br>
Additionally, laterally on each of the neighboring side faces of the components 13, 14 to be connected, a sectional indenta¬tion 8 is provided. If two components to be connected are joined together the two neighboring sectional indentations 8 form a groove 10. When the connecting clip is brought into the closed position, i. e. when the connecting clip is swung in its closed position (in the direction of arrow A in figure 2), the peg 5 already described above swings on this groove 10. Due to this design, the peg 5, on the one hand, does not hinder the assembly of the two components to be connected and, on the<br><br>
other hand, it may additionally serve for guidance. In order to enable the peg 5 to be swung on the groove 10, inyway, an as¬sembly assistance bevel 15 is provided at each edge. Of course, they need not be real assistance bevels. Also a rounding or any other suitable form may be provided in order to enable the peg 5 to reach the swiveled position without being hindered.<br>
In the following, a second embodiment of the present invention is described.<br>
In the following, in addition, a particularity of this embodi¬ment shall be described, that is the multiple usability of the connecting clip seat, as it is not absolutely necessary that always the connecting clip according to the present invention is used. Also a utilization thereof for another connecting clip is basically possible. In order to allow this, the provided connecting clip seat described above is designed in a clever way so that a connecting clip of the kind described above as well as a connecting clip of a further kind can be used. This other connecting clip is represented in figure 5. Figure 6 shows how the connecting clip according to figure 5 is inserted into the connecting clip seat and figure 7 shows in a sectional drawing how the connecting clip is inserted into the connecting clip seat.<br>
At first, the connecting clip 1-1 is described by referring to figure 5.<br>
The connecting clip has substantially an anchor-like shape. It consists of a rod 2-1 and an anchor stock 3-1 which is formed in one piece at one end of the rod so as to be perpendicular to the rod. The rod 2-1 and the anchor stock 3-1 have a substan¬tially rectangular cross-section and they are arranged so that the rod 2-1 is aligned upright to the anchor stock 3-1.<br>
At its other end, the rod 2-1 has a catch element 5-1. The catch element 5-1 consists of a V-shaped recess 7-1 which is<br><br>
opened at the lower end of the rod 2-1 and which converges in¬wards. By this design, foot member halves are obtained. These foot member halves are provided with catch projections 11-1 which project on the side of the rod 2-1 turned away from the V-shaped recess 7-1. These catch projections 11-1 include an assembly assistance bevel 6-1 for facilitating, during the later assembly, a pushing of the connecting clip into an appro¬priate groove provided in the individual component to be con¬nected. Due to the V-shaped recess 7-1, the rod 2-1 is flexible at its lower range and can be pressed together a little when pushed into a groove which is a little smaller than the foot member. This allows a slide-in into a recess the width of which is a little smaller than the width of the foot member with the catch projections, since the catch projections can be simply bent inwards so as to adapt to the width of the recess.<br>
At both end portions, the anchor stock 3-1 has a rectangularly bent pin-like insert portion 4-1 which is bent by approx. 90° so that it extends about in parallel with the rod 2-1. Within the angular range, at the inner side, a recess 10-1 is provided in order to give .the pin-like insert portions 4-1 a certain flexibility.<br>
In the following, a connecting clip seat which is provided in a component A, B to be connected and serves for accomodating the connecting clip shall be explained more precisely, in particu¬lar figure 6 being referred to.<br>
The connecting clip seat is provided twice and is located on two opposite sides of a component A, B to be connected. This design allows the connection of a component to be connected, optionally on the right or left side or even simultaneously on both sides, with one or two components to be connected. Such a side is joined to a corresponding side of a further individual component B and both components are fixed together by the con¬necting clip 1-1 (see figure 7).<br><br>
The connecting clip seat consists of a groove 20-1 which is formed on a side face of the individual component A to be con¬nected so that it is open at one end. This groove 20-1 has a substantially oblong extension proceeding from a slide-in side, that is the open side of the groove. At the open beginning of the groove, an assembly assistance bevel 23-1 serving for an easier slide-in of the connecting clip is provided. Then, an introduction section 21-1 having a groove width approximately corresponding to the width of the connecting clip's rod to be pushed in follows. Since, however, the connecting clip is pro¬vided with a catch projection 11-1 the width of which extends beyond the normal width of the rod 3-1, the catch projections 11-1 are pressed together a little when passing the introduc¬tion section 21-1. The V-shaped recess 7-1 allows their being pressed together. This introduction section 21-1 is followed by a catch section 22-1. The catch section 22-1 is provided with an undercut 24-1 the width of which is larger than the width of the introduction section 21-1. This enables the catch element to expand again after being pressed together in the introduc¬tion section 21-1 and, therefore, to catch with the undercut 24-1.<br>
According to figure 6, the groove 20-1 has a groove depth d/2 which is about half the thickness d of the rod 2-1, so that, when the connecting clip 1-1 is pushed in, only one half of the rod's thickness engages in the groove 20-1 of the connecting clip seat. The other half projects outwards.<br>
In the following, the assembly of two individual components is described. Two individual components A, B are placed adjacent to each other by joining the two sides each of which is pro¬vided with the connecting clip seat (see figure 7). By doing so, the two grooves 20-1 form an opening like a blind hole which is, at its end, widened by the undercut 24-1 so as to form the catch section 22-1. When the connecting clip is pushed in the groove 20-1 the catch projections 11-1 of the catch ele-<br><br>
ment 5-1 are flexibly pressed together. The connecting clip to. pushed in until the catch projections 11-1 engage in the con¬necting clip seat by engaging in the undercut 24-1 of the groove 20-1; this means that the catch projections 11-1, after being pressed together, regain their normal shape.<br>
Simultaneously, the pin-like insert portions 4-1 of the anchor stock 3-1 are pushed into appropriate insert receptacles 25-1 which are additionally provided in the connecting clip seat. The flexibility of the pin-like insert portion 4-1 compensates inaccuracies of dimensions, if any, on the part of the connect¬ing clip as well as on the part of the connecting clip seat. The flexibility is provided by the notch 9-1.<br>
In that the catch projections 11-1 of the connecting clip 1-1 engage in the catch section 22-1 of the groove 20-1 of the con¬necting clip seat the connection becomes locked, because the catch projections in the undercut are no longer accessible. By a simultaneous introduction of the pin-like insert portions 4-1 into the appropriate insert receptacles 25-1, all parts are aligned with each other.<br>
The connecting clip can be made of a synthetic material. It can be produced by using a plastic injection molding technique which allows a production of the connecting clip in one piece and, therefore, keeps production costs low. The same applies to the production of the connecting clip seat, which can be con¬sidered already when producing the component to be connected.<br>
By a suitable selection of the synthetic material, the connect¬ing clip can further be provided with a desired flexibility. By providing connecting clip seats on two opposite sides of a com¬ponent A, B to be connected, any desired number of individual components can be joined together in series.<br>
As shown by a comparison of the first embodiment of the figures 1 to 4 with the second embodiment of the figures 5 to 7, the<br><br>
connecting clip seats of both embodiments are designed equally. They are designed so that both connecting clips can be option¬ally inserted. This means that several functional surfaces of the connecting clip seats have a double function, that is, on the one hand, reception of the connecting clip of the first em¬bodiment and, on the other hand, reception of the connection clip of the second embodiment.<br>
E. g., partial areas of the groove 10 of the first embodiment correspond to partial areas of the groove 22-1 of the second embodiment. Further, e. g. figure 7 shows that the insert re¬ceptacle 25-1 is, for receiving the insert portion 4-1 of the connecting clip according to the second embodiment, provided with an undercut 27-1 which correspond to the undercut 11 of the connecting clip seat according to the first embodiment. Further, figure 6 shows that the connecting clip seat of the second embodiment is provided with a groove including an under¬cut, as it is necessary for receiving the connecting clip 1 of the first embodiment, which is there referred to by reference numeral 7.<br>
Summarizing, the connecting clip seat of both embodiments de¬scribed above comprises all features which are necessary for an optional reception of the connecting clip of the first or sec¬ond embodiment. Consequently, the construction of the connect¬ing clip seat is multifunctional.<br>
The above-described invention is provided in particular for electric switching devices such as automatic cutouts, residual current operated devices, auxiliary switches or the like. It is then an advantage to provide all devices of a series with con¬necting clip seats of the kind mentioned above, so that they can be assembled to any functional units desired.<br>
If, e. g., a functional unit shall be formed of three or four automatic cutouts, these devices are connected by undetachable connecting clips according to the second embodiment. For ob-<br><br>
taining a desired stability, then, e. q. ail automatic cutouts include three clip seats. One of them could be arranged within the range of the connecting terminals, as shown in the figures, and one in the bottom of the device.<br>
If, however, an auxiliary switch shall be combined with an automatic cutout, the auxiliary cutout is provided e. g. with two detachable connecting clips according to the first embodi¬ment already by the factory, which are, then, clicked in the connecting clip seats of the automatic cutout.<br>
Of course, for doing so, all clip seats of the devices of one series must be provided at the same height, since, then, the connected devices are arranged on the same top hat rail.<br><br><br>
