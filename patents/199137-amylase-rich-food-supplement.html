				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>ABSTRACT The invention is for a process of manufacture of Amylase Rich Food (ARF). The process consists of selection of the right type of cereal for germination. The grain is soaked in water for 6 to 12 hours or sprinkling of water for 6 to 8 hours. The grain is allowed to germinate. The germinated grain is dried in heat controlled incubator with a temperature of 35°C to 37°C. The grain is milled by hand pounding or using electric grinder. The ARF is further processed by addition of vitamins and minerals. The ARF has the property to liquify the solid gruel or porridge. Only a small quantity of ARF i.e. 2 to 5 gms is sufficient to liquify almost their gruel or porridge. ARF is ideally suited for patients suffering from HIV/AIDS, T.B., Refugee Camps, Athelets, bum cases and pregnancy conditions.</td>

				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to human necessities. Further this invention relates to food supplements more particularly this invention relates to improved amylase rich food . Also this invention pertains to a process of manufacturing improve amylase rich food.<br><br>
hot gruels (even upto 30%) solid concentration.<br>
The Inventor made further research in the field of ART to improve upon the same so that the benefits of composition could be coupled with the addition of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients required for specific categories of individuals such as persons, athlets adult people in refugee camps, and others ailing from certain diseases like HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Bum cases and for Tubal Feeding and Soft diets which is required in certain types of surgery. In short, where the subject requires high energy, high protein - but also more than his/her requirements of essential vitamins and minerals everyday. This is more fiilly described hereunder. The composition is made in powder form which is contained in sachet made of aluminum foil and hygienically sealed. The sachet is made in small size so that it may be conveniently carried with the user. Also due to its small size, large numbers of sachets can be cost-effectively transported and stored over long distances. The composition in the sachet is given in enclosed Annexure I.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to invent a novel amylase rich food.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel amylase rich food which is nutritious and easily digestible.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a novel process of manufacturing the said composition.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be clear from the following description.<br>
Now the invention will be described in detail. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed is clearly disclosed in the complete specification.<br>
The process of making this composition is as follows:<br>
INGREDIENTS<br>
a)	200 gms of staple flour of any cereal (will give 800 Kcal)<br>
b)	600 ml of clean water or the milk (will give about 400 Kcal)<br>
c)	One flat teaspoon of table salt (5 to 10 gms)<br>
d)	One table spoon of edible oil (15 to 20 gms - will give 135 to 180 Kcal)<br>
e)	One table spoon of sugar (15 to 20gms - will give 60 to 80 Kcal)<br>
The above ingredients would be available in any home or hospital. Hence, if the subject consumes on such feed in full he/she will get about 1500 Kcal and 20 to 40 gms of protein.<br>
2.1 PROCESS<br>
The above ingredients have to cooked in the normal way with brisk stirring. Take off the fire and allow it cool for 2 minutes then add the contents of the sachet. It may be noted that the energy 'Kcal) and protein will be supplied by the home ingredients. The contents of the sachet will supply the vitamins and minerals. The improved composition is described in the Annexure I hereto, which is powder form, is mixed to the cooked ingredients mentioned above. The thick mass of the ingredients will be transformed into a soupy condition containing the 'add-on' mentioned in the Annexure I herein. The soupy and liquified final product will be highly nutritious as it will contain both the essential macronutrients (energy, protein) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).<br><br>
2.2 A process for preparing Amylase Rich Food (ARF) comprises the following steps:<br>
i)	Soaking of grain in water for 6 to 12 hours, wrapping in wet cloth after<br>
draining the water and sprinkling of water every 6 to 8 hours, ii)       Wheat takes 48 hours to germinate to attain ideal condition to produce ARF. iii)      The germinated grain has to be dried in heat controlled incubator with a<br>
temperature of 35°C to 37°C. iv)       The grain is milled by hand pounding or using electric grinder, v)        The ARF is fiirther processed by the addition of vitamins and minerals.<br>
3.1 USAGES<br>
The composition is ideally suited for different categories of persons mentioned in the Annexure I. One way to increase energy of micronutrient requirement for those who need it (See Annexure I) is to take enormous amount of executive foods. This is neither feasible nor affordable for many. The usage of a small quantity of the improved 'ARF add on' mentioned in the Annexure I is the answer for such a situation.<br>
The improved 'ARF with the add on' supplied all the essential vitamins and minerals the subject requires/day. It also supplied half to more than half of energy / protein / fat from the home ingredients. The miracle of the ARF in sachet is that it will liquefy any carbohydrate based food such as an almost solid gruel, cooked ragi muddas, chappa this or biscuits or bread made into a thick mush. Hence, much more can be consumed by the subject in just one feed. This is specially true of the vitamins and minerals in the sachet which also will be consumed in large amounts.<br>
As described in Annexure I, the liquification process is a boon to those who require extra cut balanced nutrition on account of their physical disabilities or on account of their vocation (atheletes).<br>
The shelf-life of the improved ARF with add on hygienically packed in individual aluminium foil packets if over two years from the date of manufacture.<br><br>
3.2	A process for preparing Amylase Rich Food (ARF) comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	Soaking of grain in water for 6 to 12 hours, wrapping in wet cloth after draining the water and sprinkling of water every 6 to 8 hours.<br>
b)	Wheat takes 48 hours to germinate to attain ideal condition to produce ARF.<br>
c)	The germinated grain has to be dried in heat controlled incubator with a temperature of 35°C to 37°C.<br>
d)	The grain is milled by hand pounding or using electric grinder.<br>
e)	The ARF is further processed by the addition of vitamins and minerals.<br><br>
3.3	There is no need to germinate huge lots of grains or legumes to make porridge/gruels.<br>
3.4	The Alpha Amylase cleaves the long chains of carbohydrates into dextrine which liquefies and homoginizes the thick gruel.<br>
3.5	The ARF can permit much more of staple flour to be mixed into the gruel.<br>
3.6	On cooking (with ARF added at the beginning or at the end) the final product will not be solid and the baby or the patient will get 160 calories/lOOg of gruel.<br>
3.7	There is no need to germinate huge lots of cereals to male porridge or gruel.<br>
3.8	The addition of ARF is beneficial:<br>
i)        Li tubal feeding: In Reconmiended Daily Allowance (DRA) for moderate<br>
worker, ii)       In RIV/AIDS: Where the patient becomes very thin and emaciated, iron<br>
is very important, iii)      In Tuberculosis: Which is rampant in low-income countries, iv)       In the elderly: who have problems of less saliva, decreased ability to<br>
digest starch, loss of teeth, need for more calcium (porous bones) and<br>
generally poor absorption of nutrients in habitual diets, v)       In babies/toddlers (under two years of age): Depending on their age most<br>
babies can drink or eat any semi-solid upto 100ml per sitting. Hence, this<br>
can be made highly nutritious plus low bulk.<br><br>
vi) In Refungee camps (like Afghanistan) or Gujarat where inmates are generally not fed the right amount or kinds of food.<br>
vii) Among athletes: who need much more energy and much more of certain vitamins and minerals. For instance, swimming, squash and cross¬country running and skiing requires about 600 kcal/hour of activity. Even cricket requires about 300 kcal/hour of activity. Hence, a cricketer if is on field the whole day (8 hours) would require 8x300 kcal = 2400 calories in addition to his normal requirement of say 2000 to 2500 kcal/day i.e., 2400+2000 = atleast 4400 kcal/day.<br>
viii) High protein is also required along with calories, vitamins and minerals in prolonged fevers, hyperthrodism, the very thin and undernourished, during long convalescence and in bum cases.<br>
ix) In soft-diet conditions such as various diseases of the liver where high carbohydrate (or calories) is required, cancer of the esosphagers where the patient can swallow, ulcerativecolits and peptic ulcer.<br>
x)        In certain physiological conditions such as pregnancy and lactation.<br>
The above are give in a table form vide annexure I.<br>
3.9 Our Human Growth Trials on infants (6 to 24 months) over a six months period clearly showed the superiority of the one-complementary feed with ARP vs identical feed without ARF.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
