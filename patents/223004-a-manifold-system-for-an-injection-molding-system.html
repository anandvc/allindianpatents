				<td>The present invention relates to a manifold system for an injection molding system.<br>
The present invention relates, generally, to injection molding<br>
equipment. More particularly, the invention relates to hot<br>
runner manifold systems used for injection molding. The<br>
invention has particular utility in large cavitation systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The state of the art includes various arrangements for hot<br>
runner manifold systems to transfer molten material, typically<br>
plastic resin, from an injection molding machine to a mold.<br>
Hot runner manifold systems are well known and typically<br>
include a manifold plate, a manifold housed in the manifold<br>
plate, and a backing plate that supports the manifold and<br>
manifold plate. The manifold system routes molten material<br>
from a central sprue, which connects to an injection unit on an<br>
injection molding machine, to a plurality of nozzles which,<br>
inject the molten material into cavities in the mold. The<br>
manifold system divides the flow of the molten material into<br>
several branches as it flows from the central sprue to the<br>
nozzles. 'It is desirable that flow of molten material through<br>
the manifold system be balanced so that material arriving at<br>
each nozzle has approximately the same temperature and pressure<br>
to produce uniform parts in each mold cavity. Toward that end,<br>
manifold systems are preferably designed so that each branch<br>
provides  substantially the same size and length of flow path<br>
for the molten material. With uniform flow paths at each<br>
branch, temperature and pressure differences between branches<br>
should be minimized. However, for molds with a high number of<br>
cavities, such uniform flow paths are not always possible due<br>
to location limitations on the manifold.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, a prior art manifold system using<br>
two plates is shown with portions of the plates and main<br>
manifold cut away to reveal internal detail. For injection<br>
molding systems with many cavities in the mold, a manifold<br>
assembly 10 has a plurality of sub-manifolds 12 arranged in<br>
manifold plate 14 and fed by a main' manifold 16 mounted in<br>
backing plate 18. Sprue 20 connects to the main manifold 16 at<br>
a central location. Main manifold 16 has a melt channel 22 with<br>
branches to each arm 24 of main manifold 16 and connecting to<br>
an inlet of each sub-manifold' 12. Each sub-manifold 12 has its<br>
own melt channel network that communicates the molten material<br>
from main manifold 16 to nozzles (not shown) connected to each<br>
sub-manifold 12. In the example illustrated, each sub-manifold<br>
12 accommodates twenty-four nozzles. Typically, valve-gate<br>
type nozzles are used with such a system, f and have pneumatic<br>
valve actuators at the upper end of the nozzle that actuate<br>
valve stems in the nozzle. The valve stems extend through<br>
apertures 26 in the sub-manifolds 12 and the actuators are<br>
housed in actuator cavities 28 formed in backing plate 18.<br>
Such prior art manifold systems have significant limitations<br>
and shortcomings. Specifically, since the main manifold 16 and<br>
actuator cavities 28 are both in backing plate 18, and the main<br>
manifold 16 cannot pass through actuator cavities 28, the<br>
transverse spacing of actuator cavities 28, and hence the<br>
nozzles, can be greater than desired. That leads to the mold<br>
being larger than optimum, and flow length of the molten<br>
material being increased.<br>
Air lines 30 are routed to each actuator through the backing<br>
plate 18. The location of the air lines is constrained by the<br>
location of the manifold 16. Also since the location of the<br>
arms 24 of main manifold 16 is constrained by the location of<br>
actuator cavities 28, flow of molten material to portions of<br>
sub-manifolds 12 is not optimum. In the example illustrated,<br>
arm 24a conducts molten material through melt channel 22 to<br>
branches 32a and 32b to two sub-manifolds 12a and 12b at<br>
portions 34a and 34b located at the periphery of sub-manifolds<br>
12a and 12b. Material then flows to a central location in the<br>
sub-manifolds and subsequently through multiple channels to the<br>
nozzles. Such a flow path increases the likelihood of the<br>
molten material having less uniform temperature and pressure<br>
throughout the sub-manifolds 12, which can lead to unbalance in<br>
the system.<br>
Physical coupling, typically through the use of bolts, between<br>
the backing plate 18 and the manifold plate 14 stabilizes the<br>
layered structure by restricting bowing during the injection<br>
cycle. Plate bowing arises as a consequence of the injection<br>
pressure and pressure from spring-loaded seals at interfaces<br>
between the sub-manifolds 12 and nozzles and also between the<br>
sub-manifolds 12 and the arms 24 of the main manifold 16. If<br>
the plates bow, leakage can occur at those interfaces. Pillars<br>
36 are provided in manifold plate 14 where possible, and<br>
numerous bolt holes 38 are provided through backing plate 18 to<br>
facilitate such bolting. However, bolts cannot be put through<br>
the melt channel 22 of manifold 16, so to make the bolt spacing<br>
adjacent the manifold 16' as tight as possible, the arms 24 of<br>
manifold 16 are made as narrow as possible. To maintain<br>
structural integrity of such narrow portions, the manifold 16<br>
may have to be hardened or be made from a stronger material<br>
than is desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an manifold system for an<br>
injection molding system comprising a main manifold with at<br>
least one arm, at least one sub-manifold spaced from the main<br>
manifold, and a plurality of melt transfer bushings between the<br>
main manifold and each sub-manifold. The main manifold has a<br>
main melt channel -branching to each arm with an outlet at each<br>
branch. Each sub-manifold has an inlet and a plurality of<br>
secondary melt channels in communication with the inlet. Each<br>
melt transfer bushing is disposed between one of the submanifolds<br>
and one of the arms of the main manifold, and<br>
provides communication between the outlet of one of the arms of<br>
the main manifold and the inlet of one of the sub-manifolds. An<br>
air plate is disposed between the main manifold and the at<br>
least one sub-manifold, and between a backing plate, that<br>
preferably houses the main manifold, and a manifold plate, that<br>
preferably houses the-at least one sub-manifold. The air plate<br>
has a plurality of actuator cavities for receiving actuators<br>
for nozzles. The air plate also has a plurality of air<br>
channels therein which communicate with the actuator cavities<br>
for conducting fluid, in use, to the actuators. The air plate<br>
also preferably has a plurality of- cooling channels for<br>
conducting cooling fluid, in use, to cool the air plate.<br>
The air plate preferably has a plurality of air plate bolt<br>
holes, which receive bolts to secure the air plate to the<br>
manifold plate. A plurality of the air plate bolt holes may be<br>
disposed directly beneath the main manifold. The backing plate<br>
has a plurality of backing plate bolt holes which receive bolts<br>
to secure the backing plate to air plate. A plurality of the<br>
backing plate bolt holes are disposed directly above . submanifolds<br>
Each melt transfer  bushing has a melt channel therein and<br>
preferably a static mixer is disposed in the melt channel to<br>
homogenize the molten material at the entrance to each submanifold.<br>
Preferably each melt transfer bushing, has a heating<br>
device, such as an electric- heater or at least one heat pipe<br>
which transfers heat from the main manifold and a sub-manifold<br>
to the melt transfer bushing.<br>
Preferably, a plurality of valve gate nozzles- are connected to<br>
each sub-manifold, each nozzle has a melt channel in<br>
communication with a secondary melt channel in a sub-manifold,<br>
and each nozzle has a valve gate actuator disposed in one of<br>
the actuator cavities in the air plate. Each'sub-manifold has<br>
a plurality of manifold bushings .aligning with the nozzles and<br>
providing the communication between the melt channel in the<br>
nozzles and the secondary melt channels in the sub-manifold.<br>
Each manifold bushing has a flat sealing surface, and each<br>
nozzle preferably has a non-flat sealing surface, adjacent the<br>
flat sealing surface of the manifold bushing, which reduces the<br>
force required to adequately seal the sealing surfaces.<br>
Preferably the non-flat sealing surface is a raised conical<br>
surface around a melt channel of the nozzle angled less than<br>
one degree from planar.<br>
Similarly, the main manifold preferably has a flat sealing<br>
surface, and the melt transfer bushing preferably has a non<br>
flat sealing surface adjacent the flat sealing surface.<br>
The invention provides the opportunity for flow paths in such<br>
manifolds to be routed where needed without regard to nozzle<br>
location. The invention also provides the opportunity for a<br>
mixer to be inserted at each melt transfer  bushing between<br>
manifolds to thereby enhance mixing of resin being conducted<br>
there through and balancing of the system'.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an improved manifold and<br>
plate assembly, which overcomes the limitations arid<br>
shortcomings of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
Re-ferring to FIGS-. 3-5, an example of. the preferred embodiment<br>
of a manifold assembly of the present invention is illustrated<br>
and generally indicated by the reference numeral 50. The hot<br>
runner manifold system 50 has a plurality of sub-manifolds 52<br>
that are preferably arranged and housed in manifold plate <br>
and are fed by a main manifold 56 preferably housed in backing<br>
plate 58. As with the prior art manifolds, a sprue 60 connects<br>
to the main manifold 56 at a central location, and main<br>
manifold 56 has a main melt channel 62 that branches into arms<br>
64 of main manifold 56. Arms 64 may branch in several<br>
different directions, such as is illustrated, or a manifold may<br>
have only two arms aligned and extending opposite from each<br>
other and from sprue 60 to make a linear manifold. The<br>
manifold may also have only one arm, which in that case,<br>
functions to offset the flow in one direction only. Each arm<br>
has an outlet 63 of a branch of the main melt channel 62 that<br>
is in communication with the inlet 65 of one of the submanifolds<br>
52. The backing plate 58 is spaced from the manifold<br>
plate 54, so that main manifold 56 is spaced from the submanifolds<br>
52, and at each arm 64 of main manifold 56 a melt<br>
transfer bushing 68 connects the outlet 63 of the main melt<br>
channel 62 to the inlet 65 of a sub-manifold 52. Each submanifold<br>
52 has a'plurality of secondary melt channels 104 in<br>
communication with inlet 65 and nozzles 92 connected to submanifold<br>
52. Each sub-manifold 52 has apertures 66 through<br>
which valve stems for valve-gated nozzles pass.<br>
Between the manifold plate 54 and the backing plate 58 is an<br>
air plate 70 that has a plurality of actuator cavities 72 for<br>
nozzle actuators 90 as well as a plurality of air channels 74<br>
that conduct actuating fluid, such as air, to the actuators 90.<br>
The terms air plate and air channel are used only as labels<br>
and are not intended to limit the invention to the use of air.<br>
Other gaseous or liquid fluids can be used with the air plate<br>
to actuator the actuators 90. The actuator cavities 72 align<br>
with the apertures 66 in sub-manifolds, 52. Because the<br>
actuator cavities 72 for the actuators 90 and air channels 74<br>
are not in the same plane as the main manifold 56, the main<br>
manifold 56 can take an optimum path to the -sub-manifolds 52.<br>
Flow through the sub-manifolds 52 can be better balanced by<br>
introducing the molten material centrally rather than at one<br>
end of the sub-manifold 52, and the overall spacing of the<br>
actuator cavities 72, and hence the nozzles, can be closer,<br>
thereby .reducing the overall size of the manifold and mold<br>
compared to the prior art.<br>
Air plate 70 preferably has cooling channels 84 that, in use,<br>
conduct cooling' fluid, such as water, through air plate 70,<br>
preferably proximate to actuator cavities 72 so that air plate<br>
70 is sufficiently cool to prevent seal degradation for<br>
actuators 90 in actuator cavities 72. Cooling of air plate 70<br>
also enhances thermal isolation between main manifold 56 and<br>
sub-manifolds 52, which minimizes thermal variation in submanifold<br>
52 and improves the material flow balance in the<br>
system. Cooling channels 84 are aligned with and communicate<br>
with cooling ports 86 in air plate 70, which are aligned with<br>
and communicate with cooling ports 88 in manifold plate 54 and<br>
cooling ports 116 in backing plate 58.<br>
Cooling ports 116 may be arranged to align with and communicate<br>
with cooling ports 118 in a platen 119 of an injection molding<br>
machine in which manifold system 50 can be installed.<br>
Preferably o-rings 121, or similar types of seals, are used to<br>
provide sealing between adjacent plate faces at interfaces of<br>
cooling ports 86, 88 and 116. Such arrangement of cooling<br>
lines and ports in the plates 54,.58, and 70 eliminate the need<br>
for any cooling fluid hoses to be attached directly to the<br>
manifold system 50. Cooling fluid is received directly from<br>
the platen, to which cooling fluid hoses are attached. This<br>
reduces the time necessary to remove manifold system 50 from<br>
the injection molding machine since there are no hoses or hose<br>
fittings to disconnect from the manifold system 50.<br>
Bolting together of the plates 54, 58 and 70 is also improved<br>
with the present invention. Air plate 70 can be bolted to<br>
manifold plate 54 as desired with little concern for location<br>
of main manifold 56 since bolts 76 extend only between the air<br>
plate 70 and manifold plate 54. A plurality of air plate bolt<br>
holes 78 in air plate 70 provide for such bolting, with air<br>
plate bolt holes 78 running under main manifold 56 as needed to<br>
best counteract forces tending to separate the plates. The<br>
backing plate 58 can then be bolted to air plate 70 with little<br>
concern for the position of sub-manifolds 52, since bolts 80<br>
extend only between backing plate 58 and air plate 70. Backing<br>
plate bolt holes 82 . can be located very close to where<br>
separation forces occur near ends' of manifold arms 64, and<br>
directly over a sub-manifold 52. The better plate bolting of<br>
the present invention provides less likelihood of plate bowing,<br>
and thereby less likelihood of resin linkage at interfaces<br>
between components.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig.' 5, air plate 70 is shown<br>
as a relatively thin plate while manifold plate 54 and backing<br>
plate 58 both are thicker with pockets that house the submanifolds<br>
52 and main manifold 56 respectively. "Alternatively,<br>
the air plate 70 could be thicker and incorporate the pockets<br>
to house the 'main manifold 56 and/or the sub-manifolds. Such<br>
an arrangement allows manifold plate 54 and/or backing plate 58<br>
to-be substantially thinner plates, either bolting to air plate<br>
70.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, sub-manifolds 52 are constructed<br>
and arranged such that a plurality of nozzles 92 connect to<br>
them in a manner well-known in the art. Any nozzle<br>
configuration and any nozzle attachment method known in the art<br>
can be used with sub-manifold 52. For example, in the<br>
embodiment illustrated, nozzle 92 is spring-loaded against a<br>
manifold bushing 94 by spring 96. Nozzle 92 preferably has a<br>
non-flat sealing surface 98 adjacent the flat sealing surface<br>
100 of manifold bushing 94, which reduces the force required to<br>
adequately seal the sealing surfaces because of reduced contact<br>
area. Preferably the non-flat sealing surface 98 is a raised<br>
conical surface around melt channel 108 in nozzle 92 that is<br>
angled less than one degree from0 planar as described in US<br>
Patent application serial number 09/575,353, hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. A similar sealing interface<br>
is preferably provided between end 102 of melt transfer bushing<br>
68 and main manifold 56.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated, manifold bushing 94 communicates<br>
with a melt channel 104 in sub-manifold 52 and directs molten<br>
material to nozzle 92 through a manifold bushing melt channel<br>
106 that is aligned with the axial melt channel 108 in nozzle<br>
92. A sealing interface 112 occurs between valve stem 110 and<br>
manifold bushing valve stem guide channel 123 to prevent resin<br>
linkage along valve stem 110 to actuator 90.<br>
Another example of a nozzle/manifold assembly is illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7, where nozzle 120 has a melt' channel 122 with a nonaxial<br>
portion 124 that engages a manifold bushing 126 which<br>
communicates with melt channel 104. A sealing interface 114<br>
occurs between valve stem 128 and a valve stem guide channel<br>
125 in nozzle 120 to prevent resin linkage along valve stem 128<br>
to actuator 90. <br>
Figs. 6 and 7 also illustrate odifferent embodiments for<br>
actuator 90. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6, actuator<br>
90 is housed in a separate cylinder 130, which is installed in<br>
actuator cavity 72 formed in the bottom of air plate 70.<br>
Cylinder 130 seals between the base 132 of actuator cavity 72<br>
and a backup pad. 134 disposed between sub-manifold 52 and air<br>
'plate 70. Such sealing of a cylinder in an actuator cavity<br>
with a backup pad is described in US patent 6,343,925 assigned<br>
to the same assignee as the present invention and hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In the embodiment illustrated<br>
in FIG. 7, actuator cavity 72 is formed in the top of air plate<br>
70 and is itself the cylinder for actuator 90. A separate seal<br>
plate 136 is optionally provided to seal actuator cavity 72, or<br>
backing plate 58 itself could seal actuator cavity 72. This<br>
requires each actuator cavity to be a cylinder of sufficient<br>
quality to allow proper operation of actuator 90, but it does<br>
not require any seal that is dependent on the loads generated<br>
by installation of components below the air plate 70.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, another advantage of the hot runner<br>
manifold system 50 of'the present invention is that since the<br>
main manifold 56 is spaced from the sub-manifolds 52, the melt<br>
transfer bushings 68 are sufficiently long to allow<br>
installation of a static mixer 140 in the flow channel J.4B or<br>
each melt transfer bushing. The static mixer 140 homogenizes<br>
the molten material at the entrance to each sub-manifold 52,<br>
thereby providing a more balanced flow of the molten material.<br>
Static  mixers suitable for such application are well known.<br>
The invention is not limited to the use of any. particular<br>
static mixer. An example of -one suitable mixer, as<br>
illustrated, is described in US patent 6,382,528 assigned to<br>
the same assignee as the present invention and hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Mixer 1.40 has a spiral<br>
groove 142 around a central shaft 144 with an increasing space<br>
between the shaft 144 and the lands 146 adjacent the groove<br>
142. Flow of the molten material through the mixer 140 is<br>
transitioned from spiral flow to axial flow and homogenized in<br>
the process. Another example of a static mixer suitable for use<br>
in melt transfer bushing 68 is a stack of static mixing<br>
elements as described in US -patent 6,394,644, herein<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Melt transfer bushing 68 preferably has a heating device 150 so<br>
that there is little temperature loss in the molten material as<br>
it flows through melt transfer bushing 68. The heating device<br>
150 preferably is an electric heater, but heating device 150<br>
may be at least one heat pipe that draws heat from main<br>
manifold 56 and sub-manifold 52 to sufficiently heat melt<br>
transfer bushing 68. Alternatively, melt transfer bushing <br>
could be constructed of a material sufficiently thermally<br>
conductive to not require any heating device 150. Melt<br>
transfer bushing 68 may itself function as a heat pipe drawing<br>
sufficient heat from main manifold 56 and sub-manifold 52.<br>
Melt transfer bushing 68 is preferably fastened to sub-manifold<br>
52, such as by bolts 152 (only one of which is shown for<br>
clarity) which provide sufficient compressive force between the<br>
melt transfer bushing 68 and sub-manifold 52 to seal the<br>
interface 154 between melt channel 148 in melt transfer bushing<br>
68 and melt channel 104 in sub-manifold 52. To seal the<br>
interface 156 between melt channel 148 in melt transfer bushing<br>
68 and melt channel 62 in main manifold 56, force is exerted by<br>
a spring device 158 acting between main manifold 56 and backing<br>
plate 58 and preferably aligned with melt channel 148. The<br>
main manifold 56 preferably has a flat sealing surface 160, and<br>
the melt transfer bushing 68 preferably has a non-flat sealing<br>
surface 162 adjacent the flat sealing surface 160. Preferably<br>
the non-flat sealing surface 162 is a raised conical surface<br>
around the melt channel 148 of the melt transfer bushing 68,<br>
and is angled less than one degree from planar, as previously<br>
described. Of course, sealing between the melt transfer<br>
bushing 68 and main manifold 56 could be achieved using<br>
alternative techniques readily appreciated by one skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
With melt transfer bushing 68 fixed to sub-manifold 52 by bolts<br>
152, relative lateral motion between sub-manifold 52 and main<br>
manifold 56 due to thermal expansion differences occurs at<br>
interface 156. Because of the high frictional load at<br>
interface 156 from spring device 158, rather than melt transfer<br>
bushing 68 sliding relative to main manifold 56 at interface<br>
156, melt transfer bushing 68 may bend during such movement<br>
allowing interface 156 to leak. A centering feature 159, such<br>
as a ring, acts between melt transfer bushing 68 and air plate<br>
70 to facilitate sliding of melt transfer bushing 68 relative<br>
to main manifold 56 at interface 156 when there is relative<br>
lateral motion between sub-manifold 52 and main manifold 56.<br>
Centering feature 159 keeps melt transfer bushing properly<br>
located in air plate 70 and minimizes risk of leaking at<br>
interface 156 by minimizing likelihood of melt transfer bushing<br>
bending. Alternatively, melt transfer bushing could be made<br>
substantially stiff to sufficiently resist bending on its own,<br>
but such a design would be more massive, requiring more heat.<br>
The present invention advantageously provides an improved hot<br>
runner manifold system with less likelihood of plate bowing and<br>
its associated leakage, better thermal and geometric balance,<br>
and closer nozzle spacing all due primarily to the main<br>
manifold being spaced from the sub-manifolds. The additional<br>
space also allows for insertion of an air plate that provides<br>
all the air for valve gate actuators as well as' cooling fluid<br>
to better thermally isolate the main manifold from the submanifolds<br>
and to simplify installation and removal of the<br>
manifold system from an injection molding machine. There is<br>
\j<br>
also room for static mixers in melt transfer bushings between<br>
the main manifold and sub-manifolds to improve melt<br>
homogeneity. The invention provides the opportunity for flow<br>
paths in such manifolds to be routed where needed without<br>
regard to nozzle location. The invention also provides the<br>
opportunity for a mixer to be inserted at each melt transfer<br>
bushing between manifolds to thereby enhance mixing of resin<br>
being conducted therethrough and'balancing of the system.<br>
It will, of course, be understood that, the above description<br>
has been given by way of example only and that modifications in<br>
detail may be made within the scope of the present invention.<br>
For example, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art<br>
that more than two levels of manifolds may be supported by the<br>
invention. Sub-manifolds 52 may be grouped, for example, in<br>
groups of four, with each group fed by an "X" shaped manifold.<br>
Two, four, or more of those X-shaped manifolds with their submanifolds<br>
may be grouped and fed by another manifold. Such<br>
layering of manifolds can continue for as much space as the<br>
platen spacing of the molding machine allows.<br>
It will also be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a<br>
manifold system of the present invention can be used with hottip<br>
type nozzles instead of valve gate type nozzles. With no<br>
valve gate to actuate, the air plate has no actuator cavities<br>
and no air channels, but can have cooling channels. The<br>
benefits of separating the main manifold from the sub-manifolds<br>
when used with ' hot-tip type nozzles are improved thermal<br>
isolation between the main manifold and sub-manifolds, which<br>
can be enhanced by cooling the air plate, and the ability to <br>
install static mixers in the melt transfer bushings to<br>
homogenize the melt and better balance the system.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
