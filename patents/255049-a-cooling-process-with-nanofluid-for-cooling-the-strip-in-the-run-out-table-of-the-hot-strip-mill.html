FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a cooling process with nanofluid for cooling the strip<br>
in the run out table of hot strip mill. The invention also relates to a precursor of the<br>
development of a cooling agent by nanotechnology. The present invention is intended<br>
to be practiced only with the addition of nanofluid.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the existing practice, slabs are heated in hot strip mill (HSM) and soaked at an<br>
elevated temperature (~1200°C) in the furnace, and are subject to subsequent<br>
reductions in the Roughing and Fining Mill. The resultant strip coming out from the<br>
finishing mill is then cooled on the Run-out Table (ROT) using laminar water jets from<br>
the Finishing Rolling Temperature (FRT) (~890°C) to the coiling temperature<br>
(~600°C). The coiling temperature (CT) and the cooling rate (CR) are important<br>
paramenters at the end of the rolling and mechanical properties in turn.<br>
Laminar cooling is an efficient method of cooling for a hot strip for the reason of high<br>
value of local heat transfer coefficient between cooling water and hot strip. A Run-out<br>
Table (ROT) in a hot strip rolling has a laminar cooling system between the last<br>
finishing stand and the down coiler and cooling of the length of the strip over the<br>
length of coil is performed in the ROT.<br>
The microstructure of the grain size of the strip rolled in Hot Strip Mill is decided by<br>
the cooling rate over the length of the coil. The metallurgical transformation from<br>
austenite phase to ferrite phase in the grain brings a dramatic change in the<br>
mechanical properties of the strip during ROT cooling of the strip. The quality of the<br>
final product or the hot strip coil can change for a variation of cooling rate or<br><br>
the coiling temperature. Hence, the cooling rate is important as it in turn determines<br>
the metallurgical properties and mechanical properties. If the Mechanical property is<br>
uniform or almost same over the length of the coil, the tensile strength, Ultimate<br>
tensile strength and % Elongation of the coil is same at every point, which can<br>
guarantee better performance of the coil for use. Uniform mechanical properties over<br>
the length can be achieved by uniform cooling rate. To have the uniform mechanical<br>
property over the length of the coil, the steel manufacturers must ensure the uniform<br>
cooling rate over the length of the coil in the ROT of a Hot Strip Mill.<br>
The cooling of strip in the hot strip mill in laminar cooling by water exhibits a complete<br>
description of heat transfer mechanism. The nature of heat transfer from the bed of<br>
ROT is complex as it involves several modes of heat transfer. The strip coming out of<br>
the last finishing stand is exposed to air-cooling for a short distance (about 10 meter<br>
in the existing steel plants) before it meets first water jet at ~25°C from each cooling<br>
bank impinges on the surface of the running strip. Once it hits the hot surface, the<br>
strip at a temperature of above 800°C meets water at a temperature of 25°C. This<br>
gives rise to boiling heat transfer, which is normally described by boiling curve, as<br>
shown in Fig.2.<br>
Nukiyama [1] studied first the phenomenon of the boiling heat transfer which is heat<br>
transfer to water boiling on submerged metal surface and then elucidate the idea of<br>
boiling phenomenon. In case of water impingement on hot strip, there are several vies<br>
prevalent in the literature as described earlier and the exact nature of heat transfer is<br>
not known very precisely as the change of heat flux and the temperature change is<br>
very fast due to the boiling phenomenon and experimental studies for this case are<br>
always performed with high speed camera. The different regimes of heat transfer are<br>
illustrated in Figure 3 for a water jet impinging on a<br><br>
stationary strip. In zone, I just below the impinging jet, the single phase convection<br>
prevails as the jet temperature is very low compared to the high temperature of strip.<br>
Outside the stagnation region, the strip temperature increases and boiling starts.<br>
Regime II is marked with start of nucleate boiling. And this regime II separates the<br>
film-boiling region (Regime III) from the single phase forced convection. A situation<br>
occurs when the water jet falling on the vapor layer coalesce to form agglomerated<br>
pool due to surface tension and gives rise to regime IV. The pools are found to run<br>
away from the strip in a random-walk fashion till they evaporate or lost from the edge<br>
of the strip. Heat transfer outside these agglomerated pools takes place by radiation<br>
and convection from the dry strip surface.<br>
Instead of using water, nanofluid has been perceived as the cooling agent. It is a<br>
suspension of solid particles in the size of nanometer. The dispersion of the solid<br>
particles in the base medium increases the thermal conductivity. With the addition of<br>
4% volume of cupric oxide nanoparticles. The ethylene glycol exhibits an increase of<br>
its thermal conductivity by 40%. Similarly the large amount of increase of the thermal<br>
conductivity is noticed by the addition of aluminum oxide nanoparticles dispersed in<br>
water. Compared to the normal cooling water the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid<br>
is higher and it offers a great promise as a cooling agent for the future. Nanofluids can<br>
be described as the coolant for the future.<br>
Any particle with the size less than 100 nanometers (nm) falls under the consideration<br>
of nanotechnology. Choi [2] has experimentally shown the behaviour of nanoparticles<br>
as highly conductive particles. Nanofluids is a solution of nanoparticles of very low<br>
volume fraction distributed in quiescent base fluid. It has been found that the 30 nm<br>
diameter in volume 0.001 to 6 percent creates thermal<br><br>
conductivity of nanofluid solution as the three times of the base fluid by Choi et al.[3]<br>
Eastman et al. [4], Patel et al. [5]. In the study by Choi et al [3] and Eastman et al.<br>
[4] the anomalous behaviour in the increase of the thermal conductivity of nanofluid<br>
has been reported where the study was related to carbon nanotube and copper<br>
nanoparticles.<br>
Their findings have stimulated the idea of novel use of nanofuids for better heat<br>
transfer mechanism. People have started applying nanofluids in the area of medicine<br>
and biomedical engineering.<br>
Traditional mathematical model and correlation for thermal conductivity has been<br>
found in literature from the work of Maxwell [6] and Hamilton and crosser [7]. Recent<br>
attempt to evaluate and establishing a new correlation for the same has been<br>
proposed from the experimental work of Xuan and Li [8]. Keblinski et al. [9] have<br>
proposed four possible mechanism to provide physical explanation for the increase of<br>
thermal conductivity. The four mechanism can be summarized as (1) Brownian motion<br>
of the nanoparticles (2) Molecular level layering of the liquid at the liquid / particle<br>
interface (3) Clustering effect from the nanoparticles (4) the nature of heat transport<br>
in the nanoparticles.<br>
The thermal conductivity of metal oxide nanofluids are found to be higher than the<br>
base fluid in the work of Lee et al. [10]. Several novel models have been explored for<br>
expressing the effective thermal conductivity in recent times.<br>
A new model based on Brownian motion of the suspended particles has been<br>
developed to explain the effect of the size and temperature on thermal conductivity by<br>
Jang and Choi [11]. However, the Limited data obtained from<br><br>
experimental results are used to prove the validity of the most of the correlation<br>
developed.<br>
Based on Maxwell's theory and average polarization theory, Xue [12] has formulated a<br>
thermal conductivity model, which has been compared with the experimental results.<br>
Kumar et al. [13] have shown by means of a stationary particle model that thermal<br>
conductivity is dependent of the particle size and volumetric concentration. By<br>
considering the particle size and the interfacial properties, a correlation has been<br>
developed for the calculation of thermal conductivity of nanofluids with interfacial shell<br>
by Xue et. Al [14]. Xuan et al [15] analysed the enhanced heat transfer of nanofluids<br>
with the help of a dispersion model.<br>
In general , it is believed that the advantages of nanofluids are the reduced size and<br>
reduced cost. The reason of enhanced heat transfer performance of nanofluids may be<br>
attributed to the characteristics of nanoparticles for (1) increased surface area and<br>
heat capacity of the fluid (2) more collisions and interaction amongst fluid, particles<br>
and flow passage surface enhance the heat transfer performance of nanofluids (3)<br>
more turbulence and mixing fluctuation of the fluid.<br>
Thus, the above-mentioned prior arts suggest that the thermal conductivity of<br>
nanofluids is function of the particle size and interfacial properties. In most of the<br>
earlier studies, the focus was concentrated on the study of thermal conductivity or the<br>
development of stable nanofluid.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to achieve the stable form of the nanofluid<br>
in a laboratory study for the effective use of nanofluid to achieve the benefit of higher<br>
conductivity and translating the same achievement to the application in the plant scale.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to produce the desired higher rate of cooling in a strip vis-<br>
avis the wider range of metallurgical products in a hot strip mill. Although this study is<br>
concentrated for the specified plant, the same development can be applied for other plant<br>
with required tuning.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a method for achieving a faster cooling<br>
rate which will ensure the coiling temperature in the hot strip mill to be low.<br>

OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a method of achieving faster<br>
cooling rate over the length of the coil in a hot strip mill by a nanofluid to ensure the<br>
lower coiling temperature of the strip.<br>
Another object of the invention is to enhance formation of dual phase steel of ferrite-<br>
pearlite with optimized grain size and tensile strength at low coiling temperature and thus<br>
ensuring wider range of products from a hot strip mill with optimized mechanical and<br>
metallurgical properties.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE IN VENTION<br>
The cooling of the strip in the bed of run out table requires a large amount of heat<br>
dissipation as the strip temperature is required to be reduced from a temperature range of<br>
880-910°C over a length_of 90 ~ 100 metre.<br><br>
The heat conductivity of water is not very high. The addition of nano-particles with a<br>
lower volume concentration in water / base fluid or the suspension of nanoparticles<br>
makes the solution an efficient heat conducting liquid. The use of nanofluids increases<br>
the thermal conductivity by an amount 40 %. A nanofluid suspension is prepared in the<br>
laboratory. The nanofluid prepared from laboratory scale is proposed for use in the<br>
cooling of hot strip. This was tested first in a laboratory scale, where the strip from the<br>
hot strip mill is heated to a temperature of 900°C and thereafter the strip is cooled by<br>
nanofluid. The temperature of the strip is monitored with the time. This invention as a<br>
cooling method is specifically developed for hot plate or strip.<br>
The proposed invention is applicable to other hot strip mill, provided the similar conditions<br>
prevail. The invention has been developed on study of surface temperature of the strip to<br>
obtain an efficient cooling method. The steps in the cooling method involved are:<br>
•	Formation of nanofluid.<br>
•	Study of the cooling phenomena of hot strip by the use of nanofluid.<br>
•	Determination of the cooling rate.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Preparation of nanofiuid :<br>
A nanofiuid proposed has been prepared in the laboratory from Alumina nanopartides.<br>
Commercially available nanopartides are used for the preparation of the nanofiuid. Commercial<br>
nanopartides are procured for alumina. Different concentration of alumina has been prepared.<br>
A dispersant of Sodium Hexa-Metaphosphate has been added in the nanofiuid which maintains<br>
the stability. For the experimental purpose concentration of 0.5% and 1% has been used.<br>
Similarly solution of clay has been prepared.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL WORK WITH NANOFLUID:<br>
Fig. 4 is the experimental set up that was conceived at the beginning for the cooling of the<br>
strip. In this set up, refractory bricks are shown which are used for keeping the hot once the<br>
plate is heated inside the furnace upto a desired temperature of 950°C. The same set up has<br>
been modified and shown in Fig.5.<br>
The plate (a part of the strip from hot strip mill) is fitted with the two K-type<br>
thermocouples. The leads of the thermocouples are connected to the data acquisition<br>
system and in turn to a computer. The temperature recorded from the thermocouples of<br>
the hot plate is stored by the data acquisition. The plate/strip along with the connecting<br>
leads is placed inside the furnace for heating upto a temperature of 950°C.<br><br>
It takes about 20 minutes in the furnace to soak the plate. Following the heating of the strip<br>
is taken out. Figure 6 shows that the plate is being placed on the refractory bricks after<br>
the plate has been taken out from the furnace.<br>
Then the solution of the nanofluid is allowed to pour through the jet on the<br>
surface of the hot strip. The thermocouple attached to the strip is meant for<br>
reading the temperature of the strip with the addition of the nanofluid. The time<br>
variation of the strip temperature is recorded to study the cooling behaviour of the strip<br>
with the help of nanofluid. For comparison purpose water was used separately to cool the<br>
strip.<br>
The study is carried out with a 4 mm thick steel plate. Figure 7 depicts the comparison of<br>
cooling curve of water and nanofluid of aluminium oxide with 0.5% by wt and 1% by<br>
weight. The different concentration of Aluminium oxide, i.e. 0.5% and 1.0% has been<br>
used in the cooling experiment.<br>
It has been found the nanofluid with higher concentration i.e., 1% by weight of aluminium<br>
oxide has cooled the plate at a faster rate compared to the water that is also used for<br>
cooling. The initial drop in the temperature before the pouring of nanofluid or water is due<br>
to furnace drop-out temperature. As can be found from the results shown in Fig. 7, the quick<br>
nature of the dropping of the strip surface temperature has been manifested when the strip<br>
is cooled by Aluminium oxide.<br>
The same study has been done with silica of different concentration. This result has been<br>
shown in Fig. 8. Similar to Fig. 7, fig. 8 shows the nature of the cooling of the strip by clay<br>
with different concentration. Even in this case, the gradient of cooling is not steep when clay<br>
is used. For comparison purpose the influence of clay at different concentration in the base<br>
fluid of water could not cool at a faster rate.<br><br>
The experimental facility in the said laboratory scale will be upscaled and used for cooling<br>
the hot strip in the plant with the use of nanofluid. The prepared nanofluid will be used to<br>
cool the strip in the plant. Although the study is performed in the laboratory scale, this<br>
technology is targeted for cooling the full scale strip in the run out table of the hot strip mill.<br>
The pyrometer in the hot strip mill is the instrument for recording the temperature. If Fig<br>
7 and Fig. 8 are observed carefully, it may be noted that the nanofluid of Aluminium<br>
oxide is more effective in cooling the strip compared to water.<br><br>
We claim<br>
1.	A cooling process with nanofluid for cooling the strip in the run out table of<br>
the hot strip mill comprising;<br>
- dispersing the nanocrystalline particles in the fluid by suspension of<br>
the fluid, the nanofluid having concentration .5-1% by weight of<br>
aluminium oxide characterized in that the said coolant will increase<br>
the heat dissipation from the strips as the dispersion of the solid<br>
particles in the base medium increases thermal conductivity.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in claim 1 uses nanofluid to produce the higher<br>
amount of heat dissipation from the strip surface of the hot strip mill where<br>
the cooling fluid would enhance the more dissipation due to its property.<br>
3.	The nanofluid coolant as claimed in claim 1 wherein a dispersant of sodium<br>
hexa-meta phosphate has been added in the nanofluid to maintain stability.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>

the run out table of hot strip mill comprising dispersing the nanocrystalline<br>
