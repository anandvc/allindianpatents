The invention relates to a wire clothing for textile machines, especially for cards, with a tip, wherein the wire clothing has two wedge-shaped side faces running onto one another towards the tip and a method for its manufacture. The invention especially relates to wire clothing for stationary flats or for revolving flats of revolving flat systems in cards.<br>
The carding process of the card plays an important role in spinning technology. It influences the quality of the yarn produced and the productivity of the spinning factory like no other dividing process  Flock is carded using clothings. The use of suitable clothings is thus of decisive importance for the carding process. Thanks to the continuous further development of clothings, the productivity of the carding room has been improved continuously over the last few years or decades This development has had the result that different clothings are used on the individual working elements of the card. These clothings have quite different properties and are optimised to the particular dividing process in the card. Two groups of clothings can be fundamentally distinguished: wire clothings and all-steel clothings. In the case of wire clothings, the literature also makes a distinction between flexible and semi-rigid clothings. In this application "wire clothings" are thus to be basically understood as both flexible and semi-rigid clothings. The invention according to this application is exclusively concerned with wire clothings and all-steel clothings are thus only discussed subsequently in passing.<br>
Various clothings are known from the prior art. For example, various arrangements of clothings are described in CH 661 531, DE 39 24 890,FR 1176435, CH 177219, DE 35 36 403 C2 and DE 24 47 470.<br>
In order to grasp the mode of operation of the wire clothing according to the invention, it is important to understand the carding process. The carding process is thus explained briefly hereinafter.<br><br>
The carding of fibre flock has the aim of and primarily involves disentangling the flock into individual fibres and aligning and parallelising the fibres. The carding also fulfils further functions: further cleaning of the fibres (separating dust and dirt), disentangling (or reducing) neps (which is actually equivalent to disentangling individual fibres), separating short fibres and mixing (homogenising) the processed fibres. The carding process takes place in the card at various positions or at various working elements of the machine. The carding is inherently made possible by the interaction of two clothings. A fundamental distinction is made through the arrangement of the clothings in two positions: the carding and the doffing position. A carding effect is fundamentally achieved by both positions, i.e. even in the doffing position, although to a much lesser extent. In the carding position of the clothing, the teeth are directed towards each other (Figure 1). This configuration is found between cylinder and flat, and also between cylinder and doffer. In order for carding to take place, a relative velocity v1 must result between the clothings so the clothings move towards one another. During this relative movement the individual fibres of the flock are pulled apart, stretched and parallelised by the clothings directed towards each other. In the doffing position (see Figure 2) the teeth move in the direction in which they are pointing. During this relative movement the individual fibres from the slower clothing are transferred to the faster clothing. This position is typically to be found between the licker-in and the cylinder.<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically how the carding process takes place. The teeth of the clothings 2 and 3 are arranged in the carding position and move towards each other (shown schematically by v1 and v2). The figure shows two all-steel clothings but the process basically functions with any type of clothing which face one another in the carding position. Instead of the all-steel clothing 2, a wire clothing could thus also be shown. The figure shows how a fibre 1 holds onto the tooth 4 of the clothing 3 (e.g. the clothing of the cylinder) and is thereby transported. If the free end of the fibre 1 is grasped or contacted by one or several teeth of the opposite clothing 2, the fibre 1 experiences a tensile force F1 from the clothing 2. This tensile force is transferred from the free end of the fibre to the end lying on the tooth 4 (tensile force F2). These tensile forces stretch and align the fibres 1. If several fibres are entangled together as flock, they will also be disentangled into individual fibres by these tensile forces (known as<br><br>
carding forces). If we consider the tensile force F2 of the end of the fibre adhering to the tooth 4, this tensile force can be divided into two force components A and B. The force component A presses the fibre against the clothing and holds it there. This component makes an important contribution to the carding process. It is this component that holds the fibres on the teeth or tips of the clothings and thus allows the clothings to disentangle and align the fibres, almost like a comb. The force component B on the other hand, is a drawing-in force which pulls the fibre 1 into the clothing. This ensures that the fibres remain on the clothings and thus can be carded. The retention capacity of the clothing also depends on the force component B. The greater the inclination of the front teeth flanks 5, the higher is the retention capacity of the clothings, and the more aggressive is the carding process because the fibres adhere to the individual clothing element earlier or for longer.<br>
On examining these processes, it quickly becomes clear that the carding process depends on how good is the retention capacity of the clothing or how well the fibres are "held" by the clothings. As is shown in Figure 4, for example, the fibres 1 are held by the tooth flank 5 of the clothing element 4 and specifically both by the upper edge 6 and also by the two side edges 7. The literature states that carding takes place primarily by the upper edge 6. However, used clothings also have traces of wear at the side edges 7 so that it should be assumed that the side edges 7 also make an important contribution to the carding process. How well fibres are held by clothing elements depends primarily on the sharpness of the edges. As a result of the continuous processing of fibre material, the edges of the clothing (particularly the edge 6) become rounded with time and thus become blunt. The retention capacity of the clothing therefore decreases and the carding process deteriorates. For the carding process and the retention capacity it is therefore important that the clothings are sharp and are re-ground if necessary.<br>
On examining the examples shown in Figures 1 and 3, it can be seen that for the same types of opposite clothing in the carding position, to which clothing the fibre attaches and is transported further and which clothing cards out the fibre is in fact random. Naturally we do not wish to leave to chance the fibre transport and the type of<br><br>
simultaneous fibre processing. There are various possibilities and factors for influencing the flow of fibres and the carding process: the opposite clothings have different clothing densities, the fibres are continuously transported away from one clothing, the clothings have different velocities, the flow conditions are matched (e.g. through intermeshing zone between cylinder and doffer) and particularly effectively: the clothings have different retention behaviour as a result of clothing sharpness and special shaping (drawing-in capacity, gripping power) of the individual elements.<br>
The present invention relates to wire clothings for cards (see Figures 5 and 6). Such clothings can be found particularly in stationary flats or in revolving flats of revolving flat systems. However, the invention is not limited to this field of application for wire clothings. The wire clothings are located, as described above, in the carding position relative to the all-steel cardings of the cylinder. The most important functions of the card, disentangling individual fibres, stretching out and parallelising the fibres, are brought about by the interplay between the cylinder clothing and the flat clothing or by their carding work. This carding also has a cleaning function and specifically the separation of short fibres, dirt and dust. There must therefore be sufficient room between the individual wire clothings to allow the deposition of dirt (which must be removed periodically). The wire clothings of the flat thus make an important contribution to the carding work of the card. The fibres should remain suspended on the all-steel clothing of the cylinder and be aligned or carded by the wire clothing of the flat The retention capacity of the all-steel clothing of the cylinder must therefore be higher than the retention capacity of the flat wire clothings. In the optimum case, the wire clothings should merely card and not hold the fibres, i.e. they should only touch them to such an extent and supply a certain retention capacity so that the fibres are aligned. Fibre flock or neps should only remain suspended on the wire clothings insofar as they are pulled apart and disentangled into individual fibres and parallelised by the higher retention capacity of the all-steel clothing of the cylinder, wherein the individual fibres are transported further by the all-steel clothing. In order to possess this property, i.e. to card without offering the fibres too high a retention capacity, the wire clothings of the flat must have a small gripping area, i.e., it must be needle-shaped. That is to say, in the optimum case they should have a point-shaped tip and a smallest possible cross-<br><br>
section without sharp edges (as in the case of the all-steel clothing) so that the retention capacity is limited as far as possible.<br>
For reasons of stability it is difficult to manufacture a wire clothing having the shape described. A wire clothing which is too thin tends not to be able to withstand loading and becomes deformed. During the manufacturing process in particular very thin wire clothing can become poorly inserted e.g. punctured in the fabric or plastic layers. Using harder, stiffer material to produce thin wire clothing certainly enhances their stability but also leads to increased brittieness and an undesirable lower elasticity. In order to satisfy these requirements, wire clothings are nowadays provided with a side grinding in their working region (i.e. at the tip). Figure 7 shows different views of a wire clothing 14 with one such side grinding 11 at the side surfaces. The side grinding is logically formed on those surface regions of the wire clothing which do not lie frontally in the carding direction 15 but are positioned approximately normally thereto. As a result of the side grinding, the gripping surface discussed above and the retention capacity are optimised and the carding efficiency is this enhanced. The clothing tip ends in a sharp section, the front face 17. The individual wire clothings are first inserted in the fabric layer and then ground at the sides of the tip. The front gripping surface can thus be reduced to a minimum but thanks to the faihy long cross-section in the carding direction, it retains the necessary stability (Fig. 7). Wire clothings are frequently made of flat wire, round wire or biconvex wire and have a (unmachined) diameter in the width B (i.e. transverse to the carding direction, see Figure 7) of 0.33 mm to 0.255 mm. Figure 5 shows, for example, typical semi-rigid clothings 8. These are inserted in single- or multi-layer, barely elastic fabric or plastic layers 9. These semi-rigid clothings 8 consist of flat wire, biconvex wire or round wire, they can be curved in a U-shape (e.g. flat wire as double hooks, see Figures 5 or 6) or they can have a tip with a side grinding 10. When flat wire is used, the wire clothings generally have no knee 11, whilst for biconvex or round wire, designs with and without a knee are normal. For the invention the presence of a knee is unimportant. Semi-rigid clothings are, as mentioned, inserted in barely elastic or deeper fabric or plastic layers 9. By this means the wire can buckle less and barely move. The semi-rigid clothings 8 can thus yield far less under loading than the elastic clothings described hereinafter. The clothings are also mostly hardened. Figure 6 shows flexible clothings<br><br>
12. These flexible clothings 12 are inserted individually (not shown) or as U-shaped double hooks into elastic, possibly multi-layer fabric layers 13 (layers which are more elastic than the fabric layers 9). The flexible clothings 12 can also consist of flat wire, biconvex wire or round wire. They also have a tip with or without a side grinding 10 (Figure 6 shows clothings made of flat wire with a side grinding). If flat wire is used as shown in the figure, the wire clothings generally have no knee whereas when biconvex or round wire is used, designs with a knee are also common. The clothings are frequently hardened. The invention can typically be applied to clothings, i.e. wire clothings as in Figures 5 and 6 but is not restricted thereto.<br>
In this application the term "wire clothing" is taken to mean both semi-rigid clothings 8 and also flexible clothings 12. The application of the idea according to the invention relates to such "wire clothings". The term "wire clothing" is in particular not to be understood as all-steel clothing with saw-tooth wire, as was shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 for example. The idea of the invention cannot be applied to such all-steel clothings.<br>
As discussed previously, for wire clothing there must be found an optimum in its interplay with the all-steel clothings, for example of the cylinder. The wire clothings must not have too high retention capacity since they must not damage the fibres (aggressiveness). However, the retention capacity must also not be too low otherwise no carding takes place. An optimum retention capacity for this purpose is therefore necessary. The wire clothings of the flat must consequently have the smallest possible or optimum gripping surface, for example, needle-shaped with a point-shaped tip. For the efficiency of the carding process it is important that the tips of the wire clothing retain their optimum shape (small gripping surface with sufficient retention capacity by means of a sharp tip). As a result of the continuous carding of fibre material, the tips wear away with time in the working region of the wire clothing and become blunt. Figure 8 shows an example of such a blunt clothing tip: it can be seen that the originally sharp clothing tip (shown by the dashed line) has been blunted. With such a blunted tip the retention capacity of the wire clothing is too low as far as unsatisfactory: at such a blunt tip the fibres have an increased tendency to slip away from the clothing i.e. the fibres<br><br>
tend to slip away and are thus more difficult to align; the carding process deteriorates. Since the carding work of the wire clothings (as has been discussed previously) takes place mainly at the tip, a blunt tip 16, as shown in Figure 8, offers an unfavourable retention capacity in its interplay with the opposite clothing. The carding process is thus inferior. The state of the clothing tip can be quantified by two factors: firstly by the blunting 16.1 (rounding) of the clothing tip and secondly by the width of the edge surface 16 (see Figure 8). The greater the blunting 16.1 or the width of the edge surface 16 of the clothing tip, the more the carding process deteriorates. The width of the edge surface 16 has, however, a weaker influence on the carding quality than the sharpness of the clothing tip. When the blunting 16.1 or rounding reaches a certain value, the wire clothings must be reground at the front face (see front face 17 in Figure 7). If the edge surface 16 reaches a certain width, regrinding should theoretically also be carried out. In order to reduce the width of the edge surface 16, regrinding must be carried out at the side (so-called side grinding, see the ground side surfaces 11 in Figure 7). The fact is that side grinding is substantially more difficult to carry out: the grinding elements for the side grinding (elastic grinding bristles are preferably used) must penetrate between the clothing tip for grinding and - in order to again obtain a sharp section as given by A-A in Figure 7 - they must remove substantially more material than the grinding elements for the front face grinding. Since the influence of the width of the edge surface 16 on the carding process is also weaker, for said reasons side grinding is not generally used in practice. Preferably however, this should also be implemented. An apparatus according to Application WO 00/13850 would be suitable for this purpose. Preferably therefore a grinding apparatus is used which can regrind the front face 17 and the side surfaces 11 in a combined fashion.<br>
As a rule, even with combined front face and side grinding, regrinding takes place and material is removed until the blunting 16.1 or rounding disappears, i.e. the front face 17 again ends in a point (compare the side views in Figure 8 and Figure 7). During grinding the rounding 16.1 is eliminated but the width of the edge surface 16 is not completely returned to its original state as a result of gnnding the side surface 11 (i.e. the width 16 is not ground away back to "zero"). As a result, despite the side grinding (the width of the edge surface 16 is reduced by a certain amount during each regrinding) there is a<br><br>
gradual "broadening" of the edge surface 16. At some point the edge surface 16 becomes so broad even with side grinding that further regrinding is no longer possible and the clothing must be replaced. This reasoning naturally also applies to the case where only front face grinding is carried out without side grinding. Understandably in this case, as a result of the lack of side grinding, the maximum edge surface 16 which is no longer tolerable is reached more rapidly and the clothing must be replaced earlier. Various methods and apparatus can be used for the regrinding. It is particularly easy and quick to regrind wire clothings using an apparatus of the applicant in accordance with application WO 00/13850. By this means the support of the wire clothing (generally flats) need not be removed from the card but can be reground during operation of the card (when using revolving flats). Such an apparatus thus allows maintenance of the wire clothing without having to stop the machine.<br>
The disadvantage of the wire clothings according to the prior art described so far is that, as a result of their geometry, the maximum edge surface (16max) is reached after a relatively small number of grinding processes.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to configure a wire clothing such that is can be reground frequently until the maximum edge surface 16max (see Figure 11) Is reached.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the angle of inclination a of at least one of the two side surfaces 11 having a value which is smaller than 5 degrees, especially preferably less than 4.5 degrees.<br>
For the application of the wire clothings according to the invention it is of no importance whether the grinding processes merely comprise front face grinding or side grinding as well. The application of the wire clothings according to the invention is thus also not restricted to a specific grinding variant. The wire clothings according to the invention can also be used especially if only one front face grinding is carried out without side grinding. The advantages according to the invention are also obtained in this case.<br><br>
The invention is now explained with reference to Figure 9. The so-called side grinding (dimension h) generally goes at most as far as the so-called knee of the needle 11, i.e. as far as the bend of the needle. This corresponds to a height of approximately 3 mm away from the tip of the wire clothing. The wire clothing has, as mentioned, a normal wire thickness B of 0.255 to 0.33 mm transverse to the carding direction. As a result, a minimum angle of inclination a of 2.43 to 3.148 is obtained depending on the wire thickness. By lengthening the side grinding h, the needle can be made slimmer or the angle of inclination a can be reduced. The aim of each grinding process is to remove the rounding 16.1 (see Figure 8). As a rule, in each grinding process a (in certain regions) constant fraction Ah of the tip is removed.<br>
If we now consider Figure 11 (clothing according to the invention shown hatched), it can easily be seen that as a result of the smaller angle of inclination a, it takes comparatively longer or more grinding processes are required before the width of the edge surface 16 reaches the maximum value 16max in the clothing tip geometry according to the invention. It can be seen that with the clothing tip according to the invention (shown hatched) with a smaller angle of inclination a significantly more height must be removed before the maximum possible edge surface 16max appears. Since each grinding process corresponds to an approximately constant removal of height Ah , regrinding can thus be carried out frequently for the clothing tip according to the invention. If the same clothing can be reground frequently (until 16max is reached), this can be equated to an increased lifetime of the clothing.<br>
The possibility of being able to regrind frequently can also mean that one does not wait until the blunting 16.1 has a noticeable influence on the carding quality. Regrinding is carried out frequently and thus the carding quality of the wire clothings can be maintained at a relatively high and constant level (without having to accept a shorter clothing lifetime).<br>
The advantages of the clothing according to the invention become surprisingly noticeable especially combined with a grinding cycle according to the invention in which the wire clothings are reground after every 1 to 10 tonnes of production, especially after every 1 to 5 tonnes or 1 to 3 tonnes of production (depending on the material being<br><br>
processed). The term "production" means the quantity of (short) fibres processed by the card. Compared with conventional grinding where regrinding is known to take place after every 100 to 120 tonnes of production, in the regrinding according to the invention which takes place substantially more frequently, the height on the front face Ah is in each case only removed by a minimum amount. This ensures that an approximately uniform tip is obtained without any appreciable blunting and by this means a very high carding quality is achieved. Surprisingly it has been found when using these grinding cycles that in addition to the predicted high carding quality, a significantly higher lifetime of the clothings also results.<br>
The idea according to the invention thus comprises a wire clothing for textile machines,<br>
especially cards, with a tip wherein the wire clothing has two wedge-shaped side faces<br>
running onto one another towards the tip, wherein the side faces have a vertical height<br>
h of at least 3 mm towards the clothing tip.<br>
Preferably the side surfaces have a vertical height h of 3 mm to 4,5 mm towards the<br>
clothing tip.<br>
The idea according to the invention can also be expressed in terms of the angle of<br>
inclination of the ground side surface. The angle of inclination a of at least one of the<br>
two side surfaces must have a value as follows:<br><br>
Wire widths B transverse to carding direction (see Figures for value of B):	Angle of inclination a smaller than or equal to<br>
Up to 0.255 mm	2.43 degrees<br>
Between 0.255 and 0.28 mm	2.43 degrees<br>
Between 0.28 and 0.305 mm	2.7 degrees<br>
Between 0.305 and 0.33 mm	2.91 degrees<br>
More than 0.33 mm	3.15 degrees<br>
Preferred values for the angle of inclination a are, according to the wire thickness, i.e. the width B, 2.43 degrees, 2.67 degrees or 2.91 degrees or 3.15 degrees.<br>
The wire clothing according to the invention can also have rear grinding.<br><br>
The idea of the invention also comprises the method for manufacturing these wire clothings for textile machines. The tips of the wire clothing are provided on one side or on both sides with a side ground grinding (side grinding) so that the clothing has two wedge-shaped side surfaces running onto one another towards the tip, the side grinding is produced so that the side surface or side surfaces resulting from the side grinding have a height h (see, for example Figure 9 for h) of 3 mm to 4.5 mm, preferably 3.5 mm towards the clothing tip. Preferably rear grinding takes place by this method after or before the side grinding.<br>
The suitable wire clothing corresponds to the embodiments so far. It can consist of flat wire, round wire and especially preferably of biconvex wire. The wire diameter transverse to the carding direction B (see Figures) lies preferably in the range of 0.255 to 0.33 mm and in the carding direction, 0.355 to 0.43 mm. The wire clothing is not all-steel clothing (e.g. in accordance with Figures 1 or 2). It is not saw-tooth clothing. The wire clothing preferably has a knee and/or one or several shoulders.<br>
The wire clothing according to the invention is preferably used in stationary flats and/or revolving flats of a revolving flat system of a card.<br>
In another embodiment according to the invention as in Figure 10, the upper part of the wire clothing can be equipped with a shoulder 17. By this means the wire thickness in the working region of the clothing (that is to say in the region where the carding takes place) can be smaller without substantially reducing the stability of the entire clothing. Figure 13 shows two further variants which are embraced by the invention. The figure shows two clothing tips which only have side grinding on the one side. The other side has an angle of inclination a of almost zero. One variant also has a shoulder.<br>
Preferably the wire clothing according to the invention is used with a sharpening or grinding apparatus that is provided with a plurality of individual grinding elements which penetrate between the tips of the clothing to be ground, which sweep over the head parts of the tips and can thereby grind them at the side (side grinding 11), wherein<br><br>
additional grinding elements are provided to process the front faces 17 of the head parts.<br>
Preferably the sharpening or grinding apparatus has a rotatable support with grinding<br>
elements (e.g. elastic bristles) to process the front faces of the wire clothings.<br>
Preferably the grinding elements form a brush which lies on the clothing without<br>
substantial penetration of said grinding elements between the clothing tips.<br>
Preferably the sharpening or grinding apparatus for wire clothings (14) has a plurality of<br>
individual flank-grinding elements which penetrate between the clothing elements of the<br>
wire clothings to be ground wherein in addition to the flank-grinding elements, there are<br>
provided front-face grinding elements to process the front faces of the clothing<br>
elements.<br>
Preferably the flank-grinding elements and the front face grinding elements are<br>
arranged on a support. Preferably the support is a rotatable roller.<br>
Preferably the supports have front face grinding elements having a lower height than<br>
the flank grinding elements.<br>
Preferably said apparatus according to the invention is located in a revolving flat system<br>
of a card.<br>
Preferably the front face grinding elements have finer granulation that the flank-grinding<br>
elements.<br>
