				<td>ILLUMINATION SYSTEM AND PROJECTION SYSTEM ADOPTING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an illumination system and a projection system adopting the same, and more particularly, to an illumination system which can realize a color image without a color wheel, and a projection system adopting the same<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a conventional projection system includes a light source 100, a first relay lens 102 for condensing the light beam emitted from the light source 100, a color wheel 105 for splitting an incident light beam into R,.G and B color light beams, a fly eye lens 107 for making the light beam passing through the color wheel 105 uniform, a second relay lens 110 for condensing the light beam passing through the fly eye lens 107, a display device 112 for forming a color image from the R, G and B color light beams sequentially input through the color wheel 105, and a projection lens system 115 for making an image formed by the display device 112 proceed toward a screen 118.<br>
A xenon lamp, a metal-halide lamp, or a UHP lamp is used as the light source 100.   These lamps emit an unnecessary infrared ray and ultraviolet ray too much. Accordingly, as a lot of heat is generated, a cooling fan is used to cool the heat down. However, the cooling fan is one of sources to make noise.   Also, since the spectrum of the lamp light source is widely distributed across the entire wavelengths, due to a narrow color gamut, the selection of color is limited, color purity is inferior, and the life span is short, so that a stable use of the lamp is not possible.<br>
In the conventional projection system, to realize a color image, the color wheel 105 is rotated by a driving motor (not shown) at a high speed so that R, G and B color light beams are sequentially illuminated onto the display device 112.   R, G and B color filters are equally arranged on the entire surface of the color wheel 105. The color wheel 105 rotates three turns while one image is formed.   The three colors are sequentially used one by one during the rotation of the color wheel 105 according to a response speed of the display device 112, 2/3 of light are lost.   Also, since a gap is formed at a boundary portion between neighboring color filters for preferable generation of a color, loss of light occurs at this portion.<br><br>
Furthermore, since the color wheel 105 rotates at a high speed, noise is generated.   Also, the mechanical movement of the driving motor has an ill effect on stability.    Further, due to a mechanical limit in the driving motor, it is difficult to obtain a speed over a certain degree and a color breakup phenomenon occurs. Also, since a unit price of the color wheel is very high, the manufacturing cost rises.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an illumination according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes at least one light emitting device 10 for emitting a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, a holographic optical element 15 for changing a proceeding path of the light beam emitted from the light emitting device 10, and a wave guide 20 for guiding the light beam passing through the holographic optical element 15.<br>
An LED (light emitting diode), an LD (laser diode), an organic EL (electro luminescent), or an FED (field emission display) can be used as the light emitting device 10.   Also, an array structure in which the light emitting devices are arranged in a 2-dimension can be used.   The light emitting device 10 or the light emitting device array can be formed to emit light beams having different wavelengths.   For example, as shown in FIG. 4, the light emitting device 10 or the light emitting device array may include a first light emitting device 10a for emitting a light beam having a red (R) wavelength, a second light emitting device 10b for emitting a light beam having a green (G) wavelength, and a third light emitting device 10c for emitting a light beam having a blue (B) wavelength.<br>
A parallel beam forming unit 13, such as a collimating lens array or a Fresnel les array, for making the light beams emitted from the light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c to be parallel, can be further provided.   A holographic optical element 15 for making the light beam made parallel by the parallel beam forming unit 13 to be incident on the wave guide 20 at a predetermined angle at which the incident light beam is total reflected inside the wave guide 20, is provided.   The holographic optical element 15 diffracts the light beam incident on the wave guide 20 at a predetermined angle so that a cross section of the light beam is reduced inside the wave guide 20.   That is, it can be seen that the cross section of a light beam proceeding inside the wave guide 20 after passing through the<br><br>
holographic optical element 15 is reduced compared to that of the light beam incident on the holographic optical element 15.   Therefore, not only the volume of the illumination system but also loss of light can be reduced.<br>
The holographic optical element 15 can be installed at the upper or lower portion of the wave guide 20.   However, when the light beam passing through the holographic optical element 15 and starting from one end portion of the wave guide 20 is total reflected by a lower surface of the wave guide 20 and incident on an upper surface thereof, a diffraction angle or the length of the holographic optical element needs to be adjusted so as not to be reflected back to the holographic optical element 15.   The holographic optical element 15 can be replaced by a diffractive optical element having the same function.<br>
Also, a prisrn array 25 for making light beams passing through the wave guide 20 and proceeding in different directions from one another proceed in one parallel direction is arranged at an end portion of an exit side of the wave guide 20.   That is, the light beams coming out of the wave guide 20 in different directions from one another are condensed by the prism array 25 to proceed in one direction.   Here, although the prism array 25 is provided separate from the wave guide 20 in the above preferred embodiment, the prism array can be integrally formed at the one portion of the exit side of the wave guide 20.   Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 3A, the end portion of the exit side of the wave guide 20 can be formed to have a surface 26 inclined at a predetermined angle which performs the same function as the prism array 25.   Also, as shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C, the prism array can be formed such that the end portion of the exit side of the wave guide 20 has at least one prism surface 27 or 28.   Accordingly, the light beams proceeding in different directions through the wave guide 20 is made by using the wave guide 20, the integral prism arrays 26, 27, and 28 or a separate prism array 25, to proceed in one direction. Thus, the light beam emitted from the light emitting device 10 passes through the prism arrays 25, 26, and 28 while the cross section of the light beam is reduced by the wave guide 20.<br>
Furthermore, to secure a sufficient amount of light, the light emitting device or light emitting device array 10 is provided in multiple numbers.   Also, the holographic optical element 15' and the wave guide 20' can be provided in corresponding multiple numbers.   Here, the wave guides 20 and 20' are arranged to have a step shape on a different plane from that on which a neighboring wave guide is disposed,<br><br>
so that proceeding paths of the light beams passing through the wave guides 20 and 20' do not disturb each other.<br>
Meanwhile, an optical path changer 30 for changing a proceeding path of the light beam passing through the prism array 25, 26, 27, or 28 can be further provided. A detailed example of the optical path changer 30 will be described later.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an illumination system according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention includes at least one light emitting device or light emitting device array 40, a wave guide 50 for guiding a proceeding path of a light beam, and a focusing lens 45 for condensing a light beam toward an input end portion of the wave guide 50.   An LED (light emitting diode), an LD (laser diode), an organic EL (electro luminescent), or an FED (field emission display) can be used as the light emitting device or light emitting device array 40.<br>
An input end portion of the wave guide 50 has a surface 48 inclined at a predetermined angle so that a light beam condensed by the focusing lens 45 is total reflected in the wave guide 50.    Preferably, the surface 48 is inclined at about 45°. Here, since the light beam is condensed at a point of the input end portion of the wave guide 50 by the focusing lens 45, the cross section of the light beam passing through the wave guide 50 can be further reduced.<br>
Also, the light emitting device or light emitting device array 40 can be provided in multiple numbers and arranged linearly.    Here, the focusing lenses 45, 45' and 45" corresponding to the respective light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays are arranged on different planes in a step-like form.   The light beams condensed by the focusing lenses 45, 45' and 45" are respectively guided by wave guides 50, 50', and 50" disposed on different planes.   As a result, a sufficient amount of light can be secured.   While the light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 40 are arranged linearly, light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays emitting light beams having different wavelengths can be formed as above.<br>
A first parallel beam forming unit 43 for making the light beam emitted from the light emitting device or light emitting device array 40 to be parallel is provided between the light emitting device or light emitting device array 40 and the focusing lenses 45, 45' and 45".   A second parallel beam forming unit 55 for making the light beams emitted from the wave guides 50, 50', and 50" parallel beams is provided at the exit end portions of the wave guides 50, 50', and 50".   The first and second parallel beam forming units 43 and 55 may be collimating lens arrays or Fresnel lens<br><br>
arrays.   Here, an optical path changer 58 for changing a proceeding path of the light beam passing through the second parallel beam forming unit 55 can be further provided.<br>
FIGS. 6 through 8 show various examples of the optical path changers 30 and 58.    Here, although the examples of the optical path changers 30 and 58 can be applied to first and second preferred embodiments, reference numerals in the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be used in the following descriptions.<br>
The light emitting device and light emitting device array 10 can be formed of the first, second, and third light emitting devices and light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c respectively emitting light beams having an R, G, and B wavelengths, and can be arranged linearly in a horizontal direction, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. Also, to secure a sufficient amount of light, the first, second, and third light emitting devices and light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c emitting light beams having R, G, and B wavelengths can be provided further in multiple numbers.   The light emitting devices and light emitting device arrays can be arranged in multiple layers in a vertical direction, in addition to the arrangement in a horizontal direction. When the light emitting devices and light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c are provided in multiple numbers, the holographic optical element 15, the focusing lens 45, or the wave guides 20 and 50 are provided in corresponding multiple numbers.    In the case of a multiple layer structure, layers having the light emitting device 10, the holographic optical element 15 or the focusing lens 45, and the wave guides 20 and 50 are arranged to face one another.   The light emitting device or light emitting array corresponding to each wavelength can be formed by repeating the same horizontal structure or multiple layer structure.<br>
The optical path changers 30 and 58 selectively transmits or reflects light beams incident in different directions to proceed along the same optical path.   The optical path changer 30 and 58 can be formed of first, second, and third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c, each reflecting or transmitting the light beams from the first through third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c according to the wavelength thereof, as shown in FIG. 6.   For example, a light beam having an R wavelength is emitted from the first light emitting device or light emitting device array 10a, a light beam having a G wavelength is emitted from the second light emitting device or light emitting device array 10b, and a light beam having a B<br><br>
wavelength is emitted from the third light emitting device or light emitting device array 10c.<br>
The first dichroic filter 30a reflects only the light beam having an R wavelength and transmits the other light beams having G and B wavelengths.   The second dichroic filter 30b reflects only the light beam having a G wavelength and transmits the other light beams having R and B wavelengths.   The third dichroic filter 30c reflects only the light beam having a B wavelength and transmits the other light beams having R and G wavelengths.   Thus, when the light beam passing through the prism array 25 is incident on the first dichroic filter 30a, the light beam is reflected in a direction indicated by arrows A shown in FIG. 6.   When the G light beam passing through the prism array 25 is incident on the second dichroic filter 30b, the light beam is reflected by the second dichroic filter 30b and passes through the first dichroic filter 30b and proceeds in the direction A.   Also, when the B light beam passing through the prism array 25 is incident on the third dichroic filter 30c, the light beam is reflected by the third dichroic filter 30c and passes through the second and first dichroic filters 30b and 30a and proceeds in the direction A.   As a result, the R, G, and B color light beams traveling along different paths can proceed along the same path.<br>
Unlike the above, a cholesteric band modulation filter 35 for selectively reflecting or transmitting an incident light beam according to the polarization direction of the light beam can be used as the optical path changer, as shown in FIG. 7.   With respect to a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, the cholesteric band modulation filter 35, for example, can change an optical path by reflecting a light beam of right circular polarization and transmitting a light beam of left circular polarization, or reversely, by transmitting the light beam of right circular polarization and reflecting the light beam of left circular polarization.   The cholesteric band modulation filter 35 can be formed of first, second and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c which selectively transmit or reflect R, G, and B color light beams according to the polarization direction of circular polarization of each light beam.<br>
To improve the efficiency of light by using both light beams of right polarization and left polarization, each of the first through third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c includes a first mirror surface 37 for reflecting a light beam of right polarization and transmitting a light beam of left polarization, and<br><br>
a second mirror surface 38 for transmitting the light beam of right polarization and reflecting the light beam of left polarization, with respect to the wavelength corresponding to each filter.   Here, the light beam of right circular polarization and the light beam of left circular polarization are indicated by + and -, respectively.   For example, R+ denotes an R light beam of right circular polarization and R- denotes an R light beam of left circular polarization.<br>
The R, G, and B color light beams passing through the light emitting device or light emitting device array 10 proceed toward the first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c, respectively.    In the first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c, the first and second mirror surfaces 37 and 38 are provided in a diagonal direction with respect to a direction in which a light beam is input.   Here, an example of a proceeding path of the R light beam will be described.   When an R+ light beam of the R light beam passing through the prism array 25 first meets the first mirror surface 37, the light beam is reflected by the first mirror surface 37.   Then, when the R+ light beam meets the second mirror surface 38, the light beam passes through the second mirror surface 38 to proceed in a direction A'.    Meanwhile, when the R+ light beam first meets the second mirror surface 38, the light beam passes through the second mirror surface 38 and is reflected by the first mirror surface 37 to proceed in the direction A'.   Also, When an R- light beam of the R light beam passing through the prism array 25 first meets the first mirror surface 37, the light beam transmits the first mirror surface 37.   Then, when the R- light beam meets the second mirror surface 38, the light beam is reflected by the second mirror surface 38 to proceed in the direction A'.   Meanwhile, when the R- light beam first meets the second mirror surface 38, the light beam is reflected by the second mirror surface 38 to proceed in the direction A'.<br>
The above operation is equally applied to the G+ and G- light beams and B+ and B- light beams so that all light beams proceed in the same direction A'.   The first, second, and third cholesteric band modulation filters 35a, 35b, and 35c perform selective transmission or reflection operation with respect to only a light beam having a corresponding wavelength and transmit all the other light beams having different wavelengths regardless of the polarization direction.   Since both light beams of right circular polarization and left circular polarization can be effectively used, the efficiency of light is very high.<br><br>
Unlike the above, the optical path changer can be formed of an X prism 60 or X type dichroic filter film, as shown in FIG. 8.    Here, the first, second, and third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c are arranged to be separated from one another at a predetermined angle with respect to the X prism 60 or X type dichroic filter film.   The X prism 60 includes first, second, and third incident surfaces 61, 62, and 63 disposed to face the first, second, and third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c, the holographic optical element 15, and the wave guide 20, and one exit surface 64.   Also, the X prism 60 includes third and fourth mirror surfaces 60a and 60b formed to cross each other for changing an optical path by selectively transmitting or reflecting an incident light beam according to the wavelength of the light beam.   For example, the third mirror surface 60a reflects an R light beam while transmitting G and B light beams.   The fourth mirror surface 60b reflects the B light beam while transmitting the R and G light beams.<br>
The R, G, and B color light beams emitted from the first through third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c and passing through the holographic optical element 15, the wave guide 20, and the prism arrays 25, 26, 27, and 28 are incident on the corresponding first through third incident surfaces 61, 62, and 63 of the X prism 60.   The R, G, and B color light beams input along different paths are transmitted through or reflected by the third and fourth mirror surfaces 60a and 60b to proceed in the same direction through the exit surface 64.<br>
According to the above-described preferred embodiment, the light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c can be arranged in various ways, or one of the optical path changers 30, 35, and 60 suitable for the arrangement of the light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c can be selected and arranged.   Also, the above-described holographic optical element 15 cam be replaced by at least one diffractive optical element having the same function.    Further, in the second preferred embodiment, one of the dichroic filter, the cholesteric band modulation filter, the X prism, and the X type dichroic filter film can be selected and used equally.<br>
According to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 9, fourth, fifth and sixth light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 65, 66, and 67 for emitting the R, G, and B color light beams, a parallel beam<br><br>
forming unit 70 for making the light beams emitted from the fourth, fifth and sixth light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 65, 66, and 67 parallel, fourth through sixth holographic optical elements 75, 76 and 77 for changing the optical path of each of the R, G, and B color light beams at a predetermined angle, a wave guide 80 for making the incident light beam passing through the holographic optical elements 75, 76, and 77 total reflect and proceed, and a prism array 85 provided at an exit end portion of the wave guide 80.<br>
The parallel beam forming unit 70 may be a Fresnel lens array or collimating lens array.   The R, G, and B color light beams emitted from the parallel beam forming unit 70 to be parallel to one another are incident on the wave guide 80 to be total reflected, after passing through the corresponding fourth through sixth holographic optical elements 75, 76, and 77.    Since the prism array 85 is integrally formed at the exit end portion of the wave guide 80, the light beams proceeding in different directions through the wave guide 80 are emitted in one direction to be parallel to one another.   The prism array 85 can be formed integrally with the wave guide 80 or provided separate from the wave guide 80.   Also, to secure a sufficient amount of light, light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 65', 66', and 67' can be further provided.   A parallel beam forming unit 70', holographic optical elements 75', 76', and 77', a wave guide 80', and a prism array 85', which correspond to the light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 65', 66', and 67', are further provided in the same structure as one described above.    Here, the holographic optical elements 75', 76', and 77' and the wave guide 80' are arranged on a plane different from a plane where the holographic optical elements 75, 76, and 77 and the wave guide 80 are located, so that optical paths thereof do not overlap.<br>
According to the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, as the R, G, and B color light beams are emitted from the fourth through sixth light emitting devices and light emitting device arrays 65, 66, and 67 by being sequentially turned on and off, a color image can be formed without loss of light.    Since the R, G, and B color light beams proceed in the same path through the wave guide 80, an additional optical path changer needs not be provided.<br>
Meanwhile, the present invention provides a projection system adopting the above-described illumination system.   A projection system adopting the illumination system according to the present invention, as shown in FIG. 10, includes an illumination system for emitting a light beam, a display device 95 for forming an<br><br>
image by using R, G, and B color light beams emitted from an illumination system 90, and a projection lens unit 97 for projecting the image formed by the display device 95 toward a screen 98.   The illumination system 90, as shown in FIG. 2, includes at least one light emitting device 10 for emitting a light beam having a predetermined wavelength, at least one holographic optical element 15 for changing an optical path of the light beam emitted from the light emitting device 10, and a wave guide 20 for guiding an incident light beam input through the holographic optical element 15.<br>
The illumination system is formed of one of the illumination systems according to the first through third preferred embodiments of the present invention, and is indicated by reference numeral 90 in FIG. 10.    Referring to FIGS. 2 and 4, an LED (light emitting diode), an LD (laser diode), an organic EL (electro luminescent), or an FED (field emission display) can be used as the light emitting device or the light emitting device array 10.   The light emitting device or the light emitting device array 10 is formed of the first, second, and third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c for emitting R, G, and B color light beams.   To secure a sufficient amount of light, the light emitting devices 10a, 10b, and 10c, the holographic optical element 15, and the wave guide 20 can be further provided in the same structure in a horizontal or vertical direction.    Here, the holographic optical element 15 can be replaced by a diffractive optical element having the same function.<br>
Also, a prism array 25 for making the light beam emitted from the wave guide 20 parallel and proceed in one direction can be further provided.   As described above, the prism array 25 can be provided separate from the wave guide 20 or can be integrally formed at the exit end portion of the wave guide 20 (please refer to FIGS. 3A through 3C).   Here, a fly eye lens 92 for making the R, G, and B color light beams proceeding in the same direction through the prism arrays 25, 26, 27, and 28 uniformly distributed, and a relay lens 93 for condensing the light beam toward the display device 95, can be further provided.   Accordingly, a color image is formed by the display device 95 by using the R, G, and B color light beams.   The display device 95 can be a mobile mirror apparatus for realizing a color image by means of on-off switching operation of micro-mirrors according to an image signal or an LCD device for realizing a color image by polarizing and modulating an incident light beam.<br><br>
Here, the illumination system 90 can further include an optical path changer 30 for synthesizing light beams input from different directions by changing proceeding paths of the light beams to proceed into one direction, which is disposed after the prism arrays 25, 26, 27, and 28.<br>
The optical path changer can be formed of the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c for changing proceeding paths of the R, G, and B color light beams by selectively transmitting or reflecting according to the wavelength of each incident light beam.   The R, G, and B color light beams proceeding in the same direction through the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c are uniformly condensed by the fly eye lens 92 and the relay lens 93 to form a color image by the display device 95.<br>
Here, although the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c are used as the optical path changer in the above description, the cholesteric and modulation filter 35 for transmitting or reflecting a incident light beam according to the direction of circular polarization of the light beam can be used therefore.   Also, the X prism 60 or X type dichroic filter for changing the optical paths of the R, G, and B color light beams input from different directions to procee'd in the same direction by reflecting or transmitting the incident light beam according to the wavelength thereof, can be used.   Here, the first through third light emitting devices or light emitting device arrays 10a, 10b, and 10c for emitting the R, G, and B color light beams are arranged to be separated from one another at a predetermined angle with respect to the X prism 60 or X type dichroic filter, as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the illumination system 90, as shown in FIG. 5, may include a light emitting device or light emitting device array 40, a focusing ens 45 for condensing the light beam emitted from the light emitting device or light emitting device array 40, and a wave guide 50 having a reflection surface 48 inclined at a predetermined angle so that the light beam condensed by the focusing lens 45 is total reflected.   The parallel beam forming unit 55 such as a collimating lens or Fresnel lens for making the light beam passing through the wave guide 50 a parallel beam is further provided.<br>
The light beam made parallel by the parallel beam forming unit 55 is made uniform by the fly eye lens array 92 and condensed on the display device 95 by the relay lens 93.   Here, since an optical path changer such as the first through third dichroic filters 30a, 30b, and 30c, the cholesteric band modulation filter 35 or the X<br><br>
prism or X type dichroic filter 60 can be inserted after the parallel beam forming unit 55 as described above, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
Also, the projection system according to the present invention, as shown in FIG. 9, can adopt an illumination system in which the R, G, and B color light beams incident on the wave guide 80 through the fourth through sixth holographic optical elements 75, 76, and 77 proceed in the same direction.    In this case, since the R, G, and B color light beams proceed along the same optical path through the single wave guide 80, an additional optical path changer is not needed.   Thus, the entire volume of the projection system can be reduced.<br>
The R, G, and B color light beams emitted from the illumination system according to the above various preferred embodiments of the present invention are incident on the display device 95 via the fly eye lens 92 and the relay lens 93 to form a color image.    The color image is magnified by the projection lens unit 97 and focused on the screen 98.<br>
As described above, in the illumination system according to the present invention, since a light emitting device or light emitting device array for emitting a light beam having a narrow spectrum in a desired wavelength band is used, color purity is improved and color gamut having a wider distribution can be secured. Since the cross section of a light beam is reduced by the holographic optical element or diffractive optical element and the wave guide, the illumination system can be made compact and loss of light can be reduced.   Also, as the light beam condensed at one point by the focusing lens proceeds through the wave guide, the cross section of the light beam can be further reduced.   Further, less heat is generated and life span extends, compared to the conventional lamp light source.<br>
Also, in the projection system adopting the illumination system according to the present invention, since time sequential driving is possible by the illumination system having a light emitting device or light emitting device array, a color wheel is not needed.   Also, the on/off switching operation faster than the rotation speed of the color wheel is possible, a high frame rate can be realized and power consumption can be reduced.   Therefore, the projection system adopting the illumination system according to the present invention can provide a high resolution and high quality image.<br><br><br><br><br>
