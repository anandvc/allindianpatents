COMPOSITION PACKAGED IN ALUMINIUM CONTAINER".<br><br>

HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED,<br><br>

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to specific mousse-forming personal care compositions, which are packaged in aluminium cans having an inner coating of cured polyamideimide resin. This combination allows storage under extreme conditions without corrosion to the container.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Mousses are a particularly convenient and pleasant-to-use product form for personal care formulations. Consumers appreciate the ease of dispensing and application of a mousse. The product is generally applied to the user's hand, where it forms a creamy foam which can be easily worked through the hair or over the body.<br>
Such mousses have found widespread use in the context of hair styling products but more recently, rinse-off surfactant-based cleansing shampoos in a mousse product form have also been disclosed. Such aerosol shampoos can be worked through the hair without getting into the eyes, which is of particular advantage in the context of formulations based primarily on cleansing surfactants which can sometimes be harsh and irritating to the eyes.<br>
Aerosol containers must be pressurisable and are commonly metallic, traditionally tin plated. A well known problem in<br><br>
the field of aerosols is that of reaction of the metallic container with its contents.  This leads to corrosion of the container as well as deterioration of the product contained therein.  Corrosion is manifest as, for example, unsightly deposits in the composition and loss of propellant.  When corrosion is severe enough it may ultimately cause leaking of the can in addition to contamination of the product inside.  For example, oxidation can transform formulation components, such as those constituting the fragrance, with consequential adverse effects on odour.  Thus, stringent corrosion control is needed for personal care products.<br>
The problem of corrosion is particularly apparent when the can is used to contain water-based formulations and is further exacerbated by the presence of electrolytes such as salts and surfactants.  Thus, corrosion is a particular problem for formulations such as shampoos which typically contain high levels of sodium chloride as well as surfactant systems.<br>
In an attempt to overcome this problem, aluminium cans have been employed.  However, aluminium cans can also be susceptible to corrosion.  A further technique is to introduce a highly resistant coating on the inner surface of the container.  However, to date, we have been unable to find a satisfactory corrosion resistant container and aerosol formulation system, in which the formulation is water based and contains sufficiently high levels of electrolyte to perform its function, which meets the high quality demands and storage life of today's personal product market.<br><br>
US 5 750 223 (Tada and Hayashi) discloses an inner surface coated container, exhibiting resistance against corrosion and adsorption of the contents. The coating material is a thermosetting, cured polyamideimide of defined absorbency, which is applied to the inner surface of a metallic aerosol can. The polyamideimide coating is preferably formed from a polyamideimide resin and a curing agent comprising an epoxy resin. A wide range of contents suitable for use with such a container, such as foods, hair dyes and similar chemicals is disclosed.<br>
WO 99/32070 (Unilever) discloses a mousse-forming shampoo composition having improved conditioning performance. The composition comprises surfactant, emulsified conditioning agent, deposition polymer and propellant, for use in a pressurisable container. The problem of delivering higher levels of conditioning to hair from an aerosol shampoo is addressed.<br>
We have now found that corrosion can be inhibited by use of an aqueous personal care composition with defined chloride ion level and pH characteristics in a container, which is aluminium and coated with a cured polyamideimide resin.<br>

(b)	from 2 to 20% by weight of a propellant,	(<br>
wherein the aqueous base (a) comprises 0.16 % or less by weight of chloride ions and wherein the pH of the aqueous base (a) is from 5.0 to 8.0, and wherein the aluminium container has an inner surface coating of a thermosetting resin.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is<br>
provided a process for the preparation of a packaged mousse<br>
forming composition of the invention, comprising the steps<br>
of:	/<br>
(i)   charging the aluminium container with the aqueous base,<br>

(iii) adding the propellant through a valve.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The mousse-forming personal care composition of the invention is packaged in an aluminium container, which has a resistant inner surface coating of a thermosetting resin, preferably a cured polyamideimide resin.<br><br>
The mousse-forming personal care composition of the invention comprises an aqueous base (a) and a propellant (b) .  The term "aqueous base" will be used to refer to the liquid component of the personal care composition other than the propellant.  The term "mousse", as used herein, is the same as foam, and refers to the dispensed product unless otherwise specified.<br>
Aqueous base (a)<br>
The aqueous base (a) is present in an amount of from 80 % to 98 %, preferably 83 % to 91 % by weight of the mousse forming personal care composition.<br>
The aqueous base comprises water, which is present in an amount of from at least 30 %, preferably at least 40 %, most preferably at least 50 %.  Typically, the aqueous base comprises 50 % to 99 %, preferably 50 % to 90 %, most preferably 55 % to 80 % by weight of the aqueous base of water.<br>
The aqueous base (a) preferably has a viscosity of than 500 mPas or less (as measured with a cone and plate rheometer at<br>
21 s"1 and 25°C). Weight of chloride ions<br>
The aqueous base comprises not more than 0.16 % by weight of chloride ions, preferably in an amount of from 0 to 0.15 %.<br><br>
Sources of chloride ions are dependent upon the type of personal care composition.  For example, sodium chloride is commonly used as a thickener or viscosity modifier in shampoos.  Chloride ions are also a common impurity in some surfactants or form the counter ion in some ionic compounds.<br>
pH of the aqueous base<br>
(<br>
It is an essential feature of the invention that the aqueous base has a pH (as measured with a glass electrode at 25°C) in the range of from 5.0 to 8.0, more preferably from 5.5 to 7.0. For the sake of clarity, the pH is that of the aqueous base.<br>
The stability benefits of the invention have been found to be especially marked under neutral pH conditions.<br>
Aqueous personal care compositions according to the invention preferably comprise a pH adjusting agent.  This agent can be any suitable material, which is capable of changing the pH of the composition.  Such materials are well known to those skilled in the art. The pH adjusting agent is preferably selected from citric acid, arginine and mixtures thereof.<br>
Shampoo Compositions<br>
The corrosion-inhibiting conditions of the present invention are particularly useful where the aqueous base is a shampoo composition.  By shampoo composition is meant a rinse off cleansing composition such as hair shampoo or shower-gel.<br><br>
Sources of chloride ions in shampoos (that is shampoos which are not in accordance with the invention) are commonly as impurities in surfactants or from sodium chloride, which is used as a thickener or viscosity modifier.<br>
According to the invention, shampoo compositions must have a pH and a chloride ion concentration as described above.<br>
Shampoo compositions in accordance"with the invention preferably comprise one or more cleansing surfactants which are cosmetically acceptable and suitable for topical application to the hair. Further surfactants may be present as emulsifiers for any hydrophobic compounds present in the composition.<br>
Suitable cleansing surfactants, are selected from anionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants, and mixtures thereof.  The cleansing surfactant may be the same surfactant as the* emulsifier, or may be different. Preferably, low salt and more preferably salt free surfactants are used.  It is particularly preferred to use low salt and salt free betaines, where betaines are employed. As a consequence of the process of manufacture, the amphoteric surfactants, betaines, usually contain sodium chloride. By low salt surfactant is meant a surfactant in which the weight ratio of surfactant to sodium chloride is preferably 30:1 or more, more preferably 300:1 or more and most preferably 600:1 or more.  A suitable salt free betaine is Lebon 2000HG, supplied by Sanyo Chemical Industries, Japan.  For the sake of clarity, the term betaine as used here does not include the meaning, trimethylglycine.<br><br>

Comparative Examples D and E<br>
Aluminium containers with an inner cured polyamideimide coating were charged with shampoo bases having the<br><br>
compositions given in TaJDle 3, to make Comparative Examples D and E. The citric acid and arginine contents were selected to alter the pH to a value not according to the invention. The aluminium container was then sealed and the propellant added (LPG, 0.37 MPa at a level of 5 wt % by-total weight of the shampoo base + propellant).<br>

Comparative Example F<br>
An aluminium container with an inner coating of a thermosetting polyvinyl organosol, Micoflex (trademark) , was charged with the shampoo base given in Table 1 above to form Comparative Example F. The aluminium container was then sealed and the propellant added (LPG, 0.37 MPa at a level of 5 wt % by total weight of the shampoo base + propellant).<br>
Example 5 - Evaluation of storage stability<br>
The storage stability of Example 1 and Comparative Examples A to F were assessed by storing at 50°C for 6 months. Stability was assessed by the appearance of visible effects of corrosion on the can, specifically the formation of pin holes (i.e. leakage of the inner contents of the can) and blisters (i.e. corrosion on the inner surface of the container).<br><br><br><br>
It will be seen that storage stability was dramatically improved by use of the composition in accordance with the invention in aluminium containers with a cured polyamideimide inner coating.<br><br>
