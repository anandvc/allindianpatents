COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section ,10)<br>
AN IMPROVED DRUM CLOSURE<br>
SUDARSHAN MADHOPRASAD SARAF of 3 0 RAZAT APARTMENT, MOUNT PLESANT ROAD, MUMBAI - 400 006, MAHARASHTRA, India , INDIAN national<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Field Of Invention<br>
The invention relates to an improved drum closure, More particularly the invention relates to an improved drum closure used for metallic drums for transporting liquid material. During the painting drum bung is fitted on the bung hole to prevent spray of the paint getting inside the bung. During painting and due to the generation of heat the inside air of the drum is expanded and therefore the bung is loosely fitted otherwise drum may be get deform, therefore the spray of paint will get coated over the bung gasket. If frum customer do not permit this due to contamination problem due to chemicals, then painted caps are used to cober bung opening, and these caps after paint curing have to be removed and replaced. This is laborious and also paint cap becomes consumable and are required to cleaned of paint for environmental reason which again envisages extra cost.<br>
Drums made from mild steel of 205 liters or 55 gallons capacity employ threaded drum closures which is standard in world market. Various countries have adopted the same in their national standards.<br>
ISO has come out with draft standard. Following are the various specification numbers of this product.<br>
INDIA     :     IS 1784<br>
JAPAN     :    JIS - Z - 1604<br>
U.S.A.     :    PP - 420 - B<br>
GERMANY   :    DIN 664 3<br>
I.S.O.     :     ISO/DIS 15750 - 3<br>
STANDARD  PRACTICE   :<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Conventional Octagonal flange, round plug with capseai for leakproof and tamperproof are exhibited in annexure 1 and 2, Assembly with drum head and sketch of typical cross section is also enclosed in annexure 3 and 4.<br>
In this assembly to avoid the leakage there are three stages :<br>
1.	Flange gasket seals leakage between flange and drum top sheet.<br>
2.	Plug gasket prevents leakage between flange and plug/bung.<br>
3.	Lining on capseai prevents leakage within from leaky bung thread or leaky bung gasket, Capseai also prevents tampering of drum to retain the quality of product inside the drum.<br>
An improved drum closure which is a hybrid plug does away with paint cap and therefore, labor of inserting and removing the same is also eliminated cost of consumable paint cap is eliminated and cost of clean up of paint cap is eliminated.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The objects of the invention is to provide an improved drum closure 50mm and 20mm which obviate the aforesaid drawback of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved 50mm and 20mm drum closure which locks plug/bung because after crimping no chance of loosening in transport unlike conventional plug which has no extra lock to prevent unscrewing.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved drum closure 50mm and 20mm which reduces the labor of handling, tightening, crimping torquing because it is one of component in place of two. Common tool is made to torque as well as crimp. Therefore end user of drum also benefit and automation is easier as no need to first feed and screw the plug and then feed and crimp the capseal. Also single component becomes cost effective in place of two from point of view of procurement.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved drum closure 50mm which have hydroformed leak proof threads. Since hydroforming pressure are much high, Plug gets self checked for leakage at very high pressure, conventional plugs cannot be checked for such high pressures.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved drum closure some bung wherein there is no insert, poor weld strength causing breakage of weld problem is eliminated. Also formed lug saves cost compared to welded insert.<br>
An improved drum closure 5 0mm is threaded cup formed with skirt to act as a capseal and has formed lug to screw purpose of inserts, bung threads are hydroformed.<br>
An improved drum closure 200mm has insert which is formed from separate sheet which is converted in the combined shape of insert and capseal, then this part is welded to threaded cup to become hybrid plug cum capseal.<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved drum closure 2 0mm bung<br>
(1)	referring to fig. 2 consisting of bung threaded cup shaped<br>
(2)	insert (3) which is integral to capseal  (4) provided with scoring (5).<br>
Detail description with reference to drawings<br>
The invention will now describe with reference to Fig. 1 to 6 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan and elevation of an improved drum closure 50mm.<br>
Fig. 2 is a plan and sectional view 2 0mm hybrid bung.<br>
Fig. 3 is the assembly of the 50mm bung seal on the drum cap refer ortho view Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 4 is the assembly of 3/4" bung on the drum top refer ortho view Fig. 6.<br>
Fig. 5 is the ortho view of the 50mm hybrid bung assembly.<br>
Fig 6 is the ortho view of the 2 0mm hybrid bung assembly.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 an improved drum closure 50mm (1) consisting of threaded bung (2) which is integral to capseal (4) and it has lug (3) formed to act as a insert. There is also scoring (5) for seal tear off.<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
Fig. 3 is the assembly of drum top (1) with 50mm closure consisting of a threaded cup shape (2) having lugs (3) which acts as a insert provided with sealing surface (4) that is part of the bug cap which covers the drum top and flangs (8) which is also provided with gasket (6) and fits over the drum top (9). There is also plug gasket (7) and scoring for seal tear off (5).<br>
Fig. 4 consisting of threaded cup shaped bung (2) with insert (3) and seal surface that is part of insert (3) which is welded to bung cup (2) and fitted over the drum top (9). There is a flange gasket (5) and bung gasket (6) and scoring (7) for seal tear off. Fig. 3 shows assembly of 5 0mm and Fig. 4 shows 2 0mm hybrid bung.<br>
The invention has thus provided a cost effective and improved manner of drum closure which will avoid paint cap during painting of the drum since hybrid plug can be fitted loosely so that skirt portion covers the entire area so that spray of paint does not go on bung gasket and flange chamfer and cost effectiveness and ease of operation is achieved.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as   described in  the  accompanying  specification.<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
