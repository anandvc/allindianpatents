				<td>A PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING A DEVICE WHICH REQUIRES<br>
FOR ITS WORKING A NON EVAPORABLE GETTER MATERIAL<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing devices which<br>
require a non evaporable getter material for their working. The process is particularly<br>
suitable for being used in the processes for the manufacture of miniaturized devices.<br>
Non evaporable getter materials, also known as NEG, are capable of reversibly<br>
sorbing hydrogen and irreversibly sorbing gases such as oxygen, water, carbon<br>
oxides and, in some cases, nitrogen.<br>
The main NEG materials are transition metals such as titanium, zirconium,<br>
vanadium, niobium, hafnium and tantalum, or alloys thereof (and in particular<br>
titanium and zirconium) with one or more elements selected among the transition<br>
metals, Rare Earths and aluminum.<br>
A first use of these materials is for keeping vacuum. The maintenance of<br>
vacuum is required in very different applications, as for example in particle<br>
acceleralors, in X-rays generating tubes, in the flat displays of the field-emission type<br>
and in the evacuated jackets for thermal insulation, such as in thermal vessels<br>
(thermos), in Dewar bottles or in the pipes for oil extraction and transport.<br>
NEG materials can be also employed to remove the above-mentioned gases<br>
when traces thereof are present in other gases, generally noble gases. An example is<br>
the use in lamps, particularly fluorescent ones which are filled with noble gases at<br>
pressures of some tens of mbar, wherein the NEG material has the function of<br>
removing traces of oxygen, water, hydrogen and other gases to keep a suitable<br>
atmosphere for the operation of the lamp; another example of removal of traces of<br>
the above-mentioned gases by other gases is the purification of inert gases,<br>
particularly for applications in the microelectronic industry.<br>
Another emerging application is the use of NEG materials in miniaturized<br>
mechanical, electromechanical or optical devices. Since these devices are industrially<br>
important, and since the process of the invention is particularly suitable in the<br>
manufacturing processes of the same, in the following description reference will be<br>
particularly made to these devices and processes, but it is to be intended that the<br>
present process has general applicability in each application wherein a NEG material<br>
is used.<br>
The miniaturized mechanical or electromechanical devices are generally<br>
known in the field with the English definition "Microelectromechanical Systems", or<br>
with the abbreviation MEMS, while the miniaturized devices of optical type are<br>
known with the abbreviation MOEMS; for the sake of simplicity, however, the<br>
definition MEMS will be used in the present text also with reference to MOEMS.<br>
MEMS generally comprise an active device (the miniaturized mechanical,<br>
ectromechanical or optical part) and ancillary parts, enclosed in a sealed cavity;<br>
electrical feedthroughs assure the electrical supply to the device and the transmission<br>
of the signals from this toward the outside.<br>
The last generation MEMS are manufactured through technologies derived<br>
from the semiconductors industry, which comprise generally depositions on a<br>
support of layers of a desired material and selective and localized chemical attacks to<br>
remove only predefined parts of a deposited layer or of the support, so as to obtain<br>
miniaturized structures and geometries which would not be obtainable through<br>
traditional mechanics. Among the main types of MEMS, already used or in<br>
development at present, it is possible to mention microaccelerometers, an example of<br>
which is disclosed in the patent US 5,952,572, used for example in the motor-car<br>
field to perceive collisions and thus to activate the air bag of the vehicle;<br>
miniaturized mirrors, such as those disclosed in the patent US 5,155,778, used in the<br>
telecommunication systems in optical fiber; the arrays of miniaturized mirrors, as<br>
disclosed for example in the patent US 6,469,821, used in the formation of images;<br>
or microbolometers, that is, miniaturized detectors of infrared radiation, an example<br>
of which is disclosed in the patent US 6,252,229.<br>
Several ways of manufacturing MEMS have been proposed, but the most<br>
common ones comprise the use of at least two planar supports made of glass or<br>
quartz, ceramic material (e.g. silicon carbide) or semiconductor (silicon is preferred),<br>
whereon the different active and passive components of the MEMS are constructed.<br>
Commonly, upon one of the two supports (generally made of silicon) the active parts<br>
are constructed, for example the movable parts of a micromechanical device, while a<br>
second support (which may be made up of glass or quartz, ceramic or semiconductor<br>
material) has essentially the function of closing the finished device; the electrical<br>
feedthroughs for transferring signals between the inside and the outside of the<br>
MEMS may indifferently be obtained on any of the two planar supports.<br>
Once all the components necessary for the operation of the MEMS have been<br>
obtained on the two supports, said supports are fixed to each other, by welding them<br>
along a line which encloses the components of the device. The miniaturized device is<br>
thus sealed in a closed space and is mechanically and chemically protected from the<br>
outside. Numerous techniques, collectively known with the definition "bonding",<br>
may be used for the welding. A first possibility is the welding, simple or by pressure<br>
("pressure bonding"), wherein between the two supports it is interposed a malleable<br>
metal such as indium, lead or gold, and these are then melted and caused to solidify<br>
in the case of the simple welding, or pressed between the substrates in the case of<br>
pressure bonding: this technique, however, leads to weldings not completely reliable<br>
from the mechanical resistance standpoint. Another type of bonding is the anodic<br>
bonding (used especially in the case in which one of the two supports is made up of<br>
glass or quartz and the other of silicon), wherein between the two parts, kept at a<br>
temperature in the range from 300 to 500 °C, is applied a potential difference of<br>
about 1000 V; in these conditions, there is a migration of positive ions from the<br>
support kept at the more positive potential (for example, sodium ions from the glass)<br>
toward the support kept at the more negative potential, and of negative ions (for<br>
example, oxygen from silicon) in the opposite direction; this migration of material<br>
between the two supports gives rise to the mutual welding thereof. Another possible<br>
technique is the eutectic bonding, wherein between the two supports is interposed a<br>
layer of a metal or alloy capable of forming an eutectic composition with the material<br>
of at least one of the two supports, so that with a suitable thermal treatment a<br>
localized melting in the welding area is caused. Finally, it would be possible to use<br>
the direct bonding, which comprises the localized melting of the material of the<br>
supports, but this process generally requires too high temperatures, for example of<br>
about 1000 °C in the case of silicon, which may damage the component parts of the<br>
microdevice. Generally, all the types of bonding require a previous treatment of the<br>
surfaces to be fixed to each other, because dirty surfaces endanger the tightness of<br>
the welding. These treatments are both of mechanical type (gas blowing or<br>
mechanical washing with solid CO2), aimed to remove particles present in the<br>
welding area, and of chemical type, to eliminate the species (for example oxides)<br>
which alter the composition of the surface; the chemical treatments generally involve<br>
washings of the support with acid or basic solutions, or combinations thereof in<br>
sequence.<br>
All MEMS devices require a specific atmosphere for their working: for<br>
example, the inner space of microbolometers must rigorously be under vacuum,<br>
because traces of gases, if any, would give a convective contribution to the heat<br>
transfer in the system which would alter the measurement; the MEMS with moving<br>
parts may be in vacuum or in inert atmosphere, but the humidity content of the<br>
atmosphere must be controlled because water molecules present on the surface of the<br>
different parts which compose the microdevice may give rise to sticking phenomena<br>
or modify the friction between the stationary parts and the moving parts, thus<br>
modifying the mechanical characteristics of the system. The control of the inner<br>
atmosphere of a MEMS is, consequently, extremely important for the proper working<br>
thereof.<br>
There are different mechanisms which tend to deteriorate the quality of the<br>
inner atmosphere of a MEMS. First, the welding between the two supports, although<br>
properly accomplished, always leaves microscopic leaks which are channels for the<br>
passage of gases from the outside toward the inside of the cavity wherein the device<br>
is housed. Then, the same walls of the cavity and of all the inner parts of the MEMS<br>
release during time the gases adsorbed on their surface or dissolved inside the<br>
constituent material (phenomenon known as "outgassing"); this problem, common to<br>
all the devices under vacuum or containing a controlled atmosphere, is particularly<br>
felt in the case of MEMS, since these have a very high value of the ratio between the<br>
inner surface and the volume of the cavity. Even though the gas flow toward the<br>
inner space of a MEMS due to these two phenomena is small, it is an almost constant<br>
flow for the whole life of the device, so that in long periods of time, the total effect<br>
of alteration of the atmosphere with respect to the initial one, is important. A third<br>
phenomenon which considerably contributes to alter the atmosphere with respect to<br>
the optimal one takes place during the manufacturing process of the MEMS.<br>
Particularly, the welding of the two supports requires always high temperatures, from<br>
some hundreds of degrees up to about 1000 °C; during this manufacturing step, both<br>
the components of the MEMS and the material added for the welding, release big<br>
amounts of gases which are mostly entrapped in the inner space of the device.<br>
To obviate these problems, MEMS manufacturers use getter materials in the<br>
device. However, differently from the traditional productions, wherein the different<br>
parts of a device are separately manufactured and finally assembled, in the<br>
miniaturized productions, all components of a device are generally manufactured in<br>
series on a single support, or at most on two supports. This causes the general<br>
problem of the compatibility of each material deposited on a support with any<br>
subsequent manufacturing steps; when there is an incompatibility between a material<br>
and a process step, the material already deposited must be temporarily protected, for<br>
example with polymeric materials which are removed after the critical operation has<br>
been performed, but this obviously implies a slowing down and a complication of the<br>
process, with consequent increases of costs. The existence of the problem in the<br>
MEMS manufacture is acknowledged for example in patent US 6,252,229. In the<br>
case of getters, it is known that these materials have a high chemical reactivity with<br>
small molecules, apart from noble gases and in some cases nitrogen, and in the prior<br>
art it has been thought that the getter, once deposited on a support, has to be<br>
protected until the end of the manufacturing process, that is until it has to be exposed<br>
to the inner atmosphere of the cavity, already sealed, of the MEMS. In particular, at<br>
the state of the art, the treatment of a support whereon a getter material is already<br>
present with the acid or basic baths used for pre-treating the surfaces of the two<br>
supports before the welding operations, is considered particularly problematic.<br>
This problem is the subject of patent application US-A1-2003/0138656, which<br>
discloses a method for manufacturing a support with a getter deposit, particularly for<br>
the use in MEMS. This document expressly acknowledges that the getter is a delicate<br>
component of the system, and must be temporarily protected from the moment it is<br>
manufactured until the end of the manufacturing cycle of the MEMS. For this<br>
purpose the above mentioned application suggests to cover the getter deposit with a<br>
layer of a few nanometers of a noble metal, for example gold; this layer is inert and<br>
resistant to gases and to chemical reagents used in the different manufacturing steps<br>
of the MEMS, and thus it protects the getter deposit during said steps. In the last step,<br>
the bonding one, the temperature of the process causes the layer of noble metal to<br>
diffuse into the underlying material, that is thus exposed to the atmosphere in the<br>
cavity of the MEMS.<br>
Other patents disclose methods for avoiding the problem, or mention the<br>
necessity of the presence of the getter in the MEMS without disclosing how to<br>
integrate the formation of this component in the overall manufacturing process of the<br>
final device.<br>
The above mentioned patent US 6,252,229 proposes a manufacturing process<br>
which comprises a double step bonding, a "pressure bonding" step along a continue<br>
closed line around the cavity to obtain the gastightness, and a second one, for<br>
example of anodic bonding, more external with respect to the first one, which aims to<br>
accomplish a mechanically resistant welding of the two supports. According to what<br>
is disclosed in this document, with this process it would be possible to eliminate the<br>
getter in the cavity of the MEMS, but in this way the problem due to the<br>
accumulation of gas in the cavity due to the outgassing of the inner surfaces is not<br>
solved; furthermore, the method is, in any case, complex and expensive, requiring<br>
two process steps for the bonding, which is normally accomplished with a single<br>
operation.<br>
Patents US 6,621,134 and US 6,635,509 disclose processes wherein the MEMS<br>
is manufactured starting from a single support, thus avoiding the problem of the<br>
bonding with the second support. These patents indicate the presence of the getter<br>
material; however, since the step of formation of the getter deposit takes place almost<br>
at the end of the process, said deposit is produced externally to the cavity, covering<br>
small openings obtained on the wall thereof: in these conditions the surface of getter<br>
material exposed to gases present in the cavity is extremely limited, whereby the gas<br>
sorbing efficacy of the getter during the life of the MEMS is also reduced.<br>
The patent US 5,701,008 discloses a microbolometer manufactured by<br>
assembling two supports and containing a getter material. As to the manufacturing<br>
process, this document refers to the previous patent US 5,433,639, which relates to a<br>
process for manufacturing an infrared radiation sensor of traditional type (not a<br>
MEMS), and wherein the different components are manufactured in parallel and<br>
finally assembled; the process of US 5,433,639 is not directly applicable to US<br>
5,701,008, at least for what concerns the integration of the getter in the cavity, and<br>
therefore this last document does not give any information useful to solve the<br>
problem.<br>
Finally, patent US 6,590,850 mentions the general use of a getter in a MEMS<br>
and discloses the location thereof, but it does not disclose the manufacturing process<br>
of the device and consequently does not mention how to introduce the getter therein;<br>
patent US 5,952,572 is even more vague, mentioning only the use of a getter, a<br>
combination between titanium and an alloy Zr-V-Fe, without disclosing either the<br>
location of the getter in the cavity, and the less the step of introducing the getter in<br>
said cavity.<br>
It is therefore clear that according to the present state of the art, the integration<br>
of the formation of a deposit of getter material in the manufacturing process of a<br>
MEMS is still an open problem, and that the solutions proposed up to now are<br>
complicated and expensive.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process free from the<br>
problems of the prior art for manufacturing devices which require for their operation<br>
a non evaporable getter material.<br>
Said object is achieved according to the present invention with a process<br>
wherein:<br>
- a deposit of non evaporable getter material is formed on a support;<br>
the support with the deposit of non evaporable getter material is then<br>
treated with at least an acid or basic solution; and<br>
- the so treated support is then introduced in the inner space of a device<br>
whose operation requires the presence of a non evaporable getter material,<br>
or is used to form at least a portion of the surface which defines the inner<br>
space of said device, in such a way that said deposit is in contact with said<br>
space.<br>
The invention is based on the inventors' acknowledgement that the chemical<br>
treatments with acid or basic solutions (or combination in sequence thereof), contrary<br>
to what is commonly believed by those skilled in the art of getter materials, do not<br>
decrease the gas sorbing properties of the material, nor cause the loss of particles<br>
from the deposit or its detaching from the support, so that a NEG material may be<br>
subjected to chemical treatments used for the manufacturing of some devices<br>
wherein said material is required without having recourse to the measures of the prior<br>
art. Particularly, the inventors have determined that the chemical treatments with said<br>
solutions not only do not cause the loss of particles from the NEG material and do<br>
not cause its detachment from the support, but in some cases allow also to improve<br>
the gas sorbing properties of the material.<br>
 The invention will be in the following described in detail with reference to the<br>
attached drawings, wherein:<br>
- Figure 1 shows a part of a support on which a plurality of deposits of NEG<br>
material are present, which may be used to manufacture a plurality of<br>
devices containing said material;<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show in cross-section and in an extremely schematic way<br>
two possible embodiments of devices containing a NEG material;<br>
- Figures 4 and 5 show graphs representative of gas sorbing characteristics of<br>
NEG deposits subjected to the process of the invention.<br>
The invention may be used in all the cases in which the manufacturing process<br>
of the device containing the NEG material comprises the treatment of the part onto<br>
which said material is deposited with acid or basic solutions. Moreover, the process<br>
of the invention may be used for the activation, at least partial, of the NEG material;<br>
the activation obtained through chemical way according to the present process may<br>
be then optionally followed by a further treatment of thermal activation.<br>
As stated before, the invention is particularly suitable to be used in the<br>
manufacturing processes of devices of the MEMS type wherein it Is accomplished<br>
the bonding of at least two supports, on one of which the getter is present. The<br>
supports used in these processes are slices of silicon, glass, quartz or ceramic, called<br>
"wafer" in the field, which have generally a thickness of about 0,2-2 millimeters and<br>
diameters comprised between about 10 and 30 centimeters. On these wafer there are<br>
produced, with different techniques, the active parts of the MEMS device and the<br>
NEG deposits. From each wafer are generally obtained from some hundreds to some<br>
thousands devices. The NEG material may be deposited on the same support on<br>
which is constructed (or from which is obtained) the active part of the device, that<br>
may be a moving part or a sensor of electromagnetic radiation. However, the NEG<br>
material is preferably deposited onto the other support, the one used to close the<br>
device (defined in the field "cap wafer"), because on this part there is more available<br>
space and thus it is possible to deposit a greater amount of getter, and because in this<br>
way there are no incompatibility problems between the deposition of the getter and<br>
the presence of the active structure. Figure 1 shows a part of a "cap wafer" onto<br>
which a plurality of NEG deposits are present: for the sake of ease, this cap wafer is<br>
represented with some different areas thereof at different working steps, but<br>
obviously in the real processes all the parts of its surface will be always in the same<br>
manufacturing step. Wafer 10 has a upper surface, 11, ideally divided into areas 12,<br>
12',... (defined in the figure by the broken lines), each of which will be used to form<br>
the closing element of a single MEMS; at the centre of each area 12, 12', ..., in an<br>
area 13, 13', ..., there is obtained, for example through anisotropic chemical attacks<br>
known in the semiconductors field, a hollow 14, defined by lateral walls 15, 15', ...,<br>
and by a bottom wall 16. On at least one of the walls 15, 15' or 16 the getter deposit<br>
17 is produced; preferably, said device is formed at least on the bottom wall 16,<br>
which is the one that offers the greatest surface; furthermore, the most common<br>
technique of getter deposition in the MEMS manufacture is sputtering, and wall 16 is<br>
the most convenient for said deposition being perpendicular to the arrival direction of<br>
the material according to this technique. The finished cap wafer 10, wherein all the<br>
hollows 14 have internally a deposit 17 of getter material, is then placed over the<br>
support (not shown) on which the active components of the MEMS are constructed,<br>
in such a way that the hollows 14 define the cavity of the finished MEMS device,<br>
and that the walls 15, 15',... and 16 form, together with the surface of the other<br>
support, the walls of said cavity. The welding between the cap wafer 10 and the<br>
support on which the active components of the MEMS are present is carried out in<br>
the areas 18, that is the peripheric areas of each area 12, 12',...; the welding may be<br>
carried out by any known method, for example by anodic or eutectic bonding.<br>
The getter material used may be any known NEG material, for example a metal<br>
such as zirconium, titanium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium or yttrium, or alloys of at<br>
least one of these metals (preferably zirconium or titanium) with one or more<br>
elements selected among the transition metals, Rare Earths and aluminum.<br>
As previously said, before bonding, areas 18 must be subjected to chemical<br>
treatments for their cleaning. In the semiconductor industry there are provided<br>
numerous washing baths of the wafers, whose composition is standardized and<br>
optimized to obtain specific effects; these baths comprise both acid and basic<br>
solutions. Typical washing solutions are for example those named SC1 and SC2,<br>
wherein the wafer is immersed in sequence; the solution named SC1 is formed of one<br>
part (by volume) of ammonium hydroxide, one part of oxygenated water and five<br>
parts of distilled water, and is usually used at temperatures comprised between about<br>
60 and 80 °C; the solution named SC2 is formed of one part of hydrochloric acid,<br>
one part of oxygenated water and six parts of distilled water, and also in this case it is<br>
used at temperatures of about 60-80 °C; after the washing with the solution SC2, and<br>
optionally also between the washing SC1 and SC2, the support is generally rinsed<br>
with distilled water. Solution SC1 accomplishes a gentle chemical attack of the<br>
surface of the wafer, removing organic contaminants and particles which adheres to<br>
said surface, while solution SC2 removes the metallic contaminants. Another<br>
standard solution used in the field is a solution at 65% by weight of nitric acid in<br>
water, which is used at temperatures comprised between room temperature and about<br>
120 °C, and also in this case is followed by rinsing with distilled water. Other<br>
standard washings are with aqueous solutions of hydrofluoric or sulphuric acid at<br>
different concentrations; a broad description of the different washing solutions used<br>
in the field, and of their effects on substrates, is given in the book "Handbook of<br>
Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology", edited by Y. Nishi and R. Doering,<br>
published in 2000 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. publisher (in particular, see pags. 87-104).<br>
According to the process of the invention, during these steps of chemical attack<br>
the whole surface 11 of the cap wafer, as well as the walls of the hollows 14 free of<br>
the getter and the getter itself, are subjected to the same treatment, without the<br>
necessity of maskings for the temporary protection of the getter; this allows to have a<br>
simple, efficient and economic manufacturing process. Once the bonding has been<br>
carried out between the cap wafer 10 and the support on which the active<br>
components of the MEMS device are constructed, the single devices may be<br>
separated by cutting along the broken lines 19, 19', ..., in figure 1.<br>
Figure 2 shows in section and in an extremely schematic way a MEMS device<br>
which may be manufactured through the process of the invention. The device 20 is<br>
formed by assembling a part 21 and a part 22, joined to each other through a welding<br>
23; each of these two parts originates from a support of bigger dimension, and in<br>
particular part 22 originates from a support of type 10 after it has been cut along the<br>
broken lines of figure 1; said cutting is preferably carried out after the welding<br>
operation of the two supports. Between the parts 21 and 22 there is a cavity 24,<br>
which may be under vacuum or contain a controlled atmosphere; this cavity is<br>
defined by surface 25 of part 21, and by walls 15, 15', ... and 16 described with<br>
reference to figure 1. Onto wall 16 of part 22 there is the deposit of getter material<br>
17; finally, in cavity 24 the active part, 26, of the MEMS device is housed. For the<br>
sake of simplicity there are not shown other elements which form the device, such as<br>
the electrical feedthroughs which connect part 26 with the outside of the device.<br>
Figure 3 shows another possible MEMS device, 30, produced with the process<br>
of the invention. In this case, both the active part 31 and the getter deposit 32 are<br>
formed on the same part of support 33, while part 34 acts, in this case, simply as<br>
closing element of cavity 35; this structure is, however, less preferable than that of<br>
figure 2, since, as already said, in this case the space available for the getter deposit<br>
32 is smaller (with a consequent reduced gas sorbing capacity) and the production of<br>
both deposit 32 and part 31 on a part 33 of the same support is more complex.<br>
The formation of the getter deposit (17, 32) onto one of the two supports may<br>
be carried out according to different techniques, for example by evaporation; the<br>
preferred technique is in any case sputtering, which is the technique most widely<br>
used in the industrial manufacture of miniaturized devices on planar supports, and<br>
thus also of MEMS. The sputtering technique allows to obtain deposits with a<br>
thickness from fractions of micrometers (micron, µm) up to some tens of micron,<br>
which have an excellent adhesion to the substrate without loss of particles. With this<br>
technique it is also possible to control (at least within certain limits) the morphology<br>
of the deposit, optimizing it for the expected application; in the case of getter<br>
deposits, for example, it is preferable to have a columnar morphology, which shows<br>
a high specific surface (surface per unit of weight of the deposit). Moreover, with<br>
this technique it is possible to control to a high degree of precision also the lateral<br>
location of the deposit, ensuring that all deposits 17 or 32 are always in the same<br>
position in each device of type 20 or 30.<br>
The getter deposit 17 or 32, even if it has already been activated during the<br>
treatment with the cleaning chemical solutions of the surfaces of the two supports,<br>
undergoes a further activation during the bonding of said supports. As already said,<br>
all bonding operations imply the heating of the two supports at temperatures of some<br>
hundreds of degrees Celsius; at these temperatures all the components of the MEMS<br>
devices under manufacture release gases; the bonding operation is usually carried out<br>
under pumping, just to eliminate these gases, but during bonding the two supports are<br>
necessarily very close, and in the final step of the bonding the cavity of the device is<br>
closed and thus the pumping from outside is ineffective. Having an active getter<br>
device in this step helps to get rid of the undesirable gases, potentially harmful for<br>
the application. The process of the invention, allowing to have an active getter from<br>
the very beginning of this operation, ensures a better cleaning of the inner<br>
atmosphere of the device, because it increases the period of time in which the getter<br>
can play its action.<br>
The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this example it is checked the compatibility of a support with a deposit of<br>
getter material with the combined treatment with SC1 and SC2 solutions.<br>
On three silicon disks of 2.5 cm of diameter a 2 µm thick deposit of an alloy<br>
made up of zirconium, cobalt and Rare Earths is produced by sputtering; the deposit<br>
is produced starting from a target of alloy St 787, disclosed in the patent US<br>
5,961,750 in the name of the applicant. The first sample thus produced is not treated<br>
further, and constitutes the reference sample for this test. The second sample is<br>
immersed for 15 minutes in a bath of SC1 solution kept at 80 °C, then taken out,<br>
rinsed with distilled water and dried with a flow of dry nitrogen. The third sample is<br>
first immersed in the SC1 solution and then in the SC2 solution, for a period of 15<br>
minutes for each bath, then rinsed with distilled water and then dried with dry<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The three samples so obtained are initially subjected to a visual analysis at the<br>
optic microscope to check the morphology of the deposit and the possible<br>
detachment from the support; this first examination confirms that after the baths SC1<br>
and SC2 there is no detachment of the deposit from the support, and. that the samples<br>
treated with said baths do not lose particles.<br>
Subsequently, the three samples are assembled in vacuum benches and<br>
activated with a treatment under vacuum at 450 °C for 45 minutes; afterwards the<br>
samples are allowed to cool at 25 °C and their characteristics of hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide (CO) sorption are measured, according to the procedure defined in the<br>
standard ASTM F 798-82, with a testing pressure of 10-4 Pa. The results of the six<br>
tests are reported in figure 4 (in double logarithmic scale), as gas sorbing rate, S<br>
(measured in cc of gas sorbed per second and per square centimeter of deposit) as a<br>
function of the amount of gas sorbed, Q (measured in cc of gas sorbed multiplied by<br>
the pressure of measure in hectoPascal, hPa, per square centimeter of deposit); in<br>
particular, the graphs 1, 2 and 3 in figure 4 are referred to hydrogen sorption<br>
respectively on the reference sample, after the single treatment with SC1 and after<br>
the treatment with SC2, while the graphs 4-6 are referred to CO sorption on the<br>
reference sample, after the treatment with SC1 and after the treatment with SC2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this example it is checked the compatibility of a deposit of getter material on<br>
a support with the combined treatment with aqueous solutions of nitric acid at<br>
different temperatures for different period of times.<br>
Four samples similar to those produced for example 1 are prepared. The first<br>
one of these in not subjected to any treatment and constitutes the reference sample;<br>
the second one is immersed for 30 minutes in an aqueous solution of HNO3 at 65%<br>
by weight at room temperature; the third one is immersed in the same solution for 10<br>
minutes at 60°C; and the fourth one is immersed in the same solution for 10 minutes<br>
at 120°C.<br>
Also in this case the four samples, after possible rinsing and drying with<br>
nitrogen, are analyzed from the point of view of the detachment from support and of<br>
the loss of particles, confirming that the treatments in nitric acid do not alter these<br>
two parameters with respect to the reference sample.<br>
The four samples are then subjected to hydrogen and carbon monoxide sorbing<br>
tests as described in example 1. The results of the tests are reported in figure 5, as<br>
graphs from 7 to 10 for hydrogen sorption by, respectively, the samples from the first<br>
one to the fourth one as described; and graphs from 11 to 14 refer to CO sorption by<br>
the four samples (graphs 7 and 11 thus represent the properties of the reference<br>
samples in hydrogen and CO sorption, respectively).<br>
As can be noted from the graphs reported in figure 4, while the SC1 treatment<br>
worsens the sorbing characteristics of the getter films both for hydrogen and CO, the<br>
subsequent treatment with SC2 implies an improvement, increasing the hydrogen<br>
sorption to a value that is about three times that of the reference sample, and<br>
increasing rate and capacity of CO sorption of about one order of magnitude. All the<br>
three treatments tested with nitric acid, instead, give rise to sorbing characteristics of<br>
both hydrogen and CO comparable one to the other, and also in this case sensibly<br>
better than those of the reference sample.<br>
