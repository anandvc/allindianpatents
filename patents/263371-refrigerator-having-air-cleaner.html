Description<br>
REFRIGERATOR HAVING AIR-CLEANER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a re-<br>
frigerator in which an air-cleaner for purifying indoor air is provided on an upper surface of a refrigerator main body. <br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A refrigerator is an electric appliance for keeping foods fresh for a long time by re-<br>
frigerating or freezing them. Herein, the present invention will be described in connection to a side-by-side type refrigerator in which a freezing chamber and a refrigerating chamber are formed side by side.<br>
[3]	Fig. 1 shows a refrigerator having an air-cleaner according to a prior art.<br>
[4]	As shown in the figure, an air-cleaner 100 is detachably mounted on an upper<br>
surface of a refrigerator 10. The air-cleaner 100 comprises a case 110, filter units 120, a blower 130, and an anion generator 140. The case 110 is provided with inlets I and an outlet O through which air comes in and out. The filter units 120 serve to filter the air sucked through the inlets I. The blower 130 serves to suck the air through the inlets I and discharge the air filtered in the filter units 120 through the outlet O. The anion generator 140 generates anions to be discharged along with the air through the outlet Q<br>
[5]	The case 110 includes a blower case 112 and filter cases 116. The blower case 112<br>
is formed in a flat hexahedral shape with open both ends. The filter cases 116 are in communication with the both ends of the blower case 112. The outlet Q is formed in a front surface of the blower case 112. The blower 130 and the anion generator 140 are provided in the blower case 112.<br>
f6]	In addition, a pair of guide grooves 110a and 110b are formed in a bottom surface<br>
of the blower case 112. A pair of guide rails 10a and 10b, which are provided on the upper surface of the refrigerator 10, are inserted into the guide grooves 110a and 110b.<br>
[7]	In the meantime, the inlets I are formed in outer ends of the filter cases 116. The<br>
filter units 120 are detachably mounted in the filter cases 116. The filter cases 116 are mounted to be movable from side to side in a state where they are fitted into the blower case 112. A pair of support portions 116a are formed on a bottom surface of each of the filter cases 116. The support portions 116a are supported on the upper surface of the refrigerator 10 so that the filter cases can be flush with the blower case 112.<br>
[8]	In addition, a suction grille G is mounted in the inlet I. The suction grille G is<br>
provided with a filtering net that serves to filter out foreign materials from the air<br><br>
2<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
sucked through the inlets I. A filter mount opening 116h and guide ribs 116L are formed in a front surface and on a floor surface of each of the filter cases 116, respectively. The filter mount opening 116h and the guide ribs 116L are for the purpose of mounting and dismounting the filter unit 120.<br>
[9]	The filter unit 120 includes a filter drawer 126, an antibiotic filter 122, a dust<br>
collection filter 123, and a deodorizing filter 124. The filter drawer 126 is formed in a substantially hexahedral shape with an open upper face. The filter drawer 126 is mounted in the filter case 116 through the filter mount opening 116h.<br>
f 10]	Although not shown, the filter case 116 and/or the filter drawer 126 are provided<br>
with fasteners. The fasteners serve to prevent the filter drawer 126 from being detached from the filter case 116 inadvertently.<br>
[11]	The filter drawer 126 is guided by the guide ribs 116L. In addition, aplurality of<br>
guide portions 128a are provided in the filter drawer 126. The guide portions 128a serve to secure the filters 122, 123, and 124.<br>
[12]	The antibiotic filter 122, the dust collection filter 123, and the deodorizing filter 124<br>
are provided in the filter drawer 126 in this order from its inner end. The antibiotic filter 122, the dust collection filter 123, and the deodorizing filter 124 serve to remove various kinds of bacteria, dust and odor in air.<br>
[ 131	The blower 130 comprises a blowing fan (not shown), a fan housing 132, and a<br>
driving motor (not shown). An axial flow fan, which sucks air in an axial direction and discharges the sucked air in a radial direction, is used as the blowing fan. The blowing fan is installed in the fan housing 132. The driving motor serves to drive the blowing fan. The fan housing 132 is fastened with screws (not shown) to bosses provided on a floor surface of the blower case 112. When the driving motor drives the blowing fan, air is sucked through a lower portion of the fan housing 132 and discharged forward.<br>
[14]	In addition, an air guide 134 is provided in the blower case 112. The air guide 134<br>
guides air sucked by the blower 130 through the inlets I to be discharged through the outlet O. The interior of the blower case 112 is divided by the air guide 134 into a suction channel a and a discharge channel b.<br>
[15]	In the meantime, the anion generator 140 is installed at a side of the discharge<br>
channel B adjacent to the blower 130. Anions generated in the anion generator 140 are discharged through the outlet O together with the air blown by the blower 130.<br>
[16]	A display 152 is provided at aside of the front surface of the blower case ll2.The<br>
display 152 serves to display an operational state of the air-cleaner 100 to the outside. In addition, an operating unit 154 is provided at the side of the front surface of the blower case 112 adjacent to the display 152. The operating unit 154 receives a variety of signals for operating the air-cleaner 100.<br>
[17]	However, the refrigerator having the air-cleaner according to the prior art has the<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
following problems.<br>
[18]	In the prior art, by inserting the guide rails 10 and 10b formed on the upper surface<br>
of the main body 10 into the guide grooves 110a and 110b formed on the bottom surface of the case 110, respectively, the air-cleaner 100 is mounted on the refrigerator. However, there is provided no additional means for preventing the guide rails 10a and 10b from moving in a fore and aft direction in a stale where the guide rails 10a and 10b are inserted in the guide grooves 110a and 110b. Thus, due to user s carelessness, the air-cleaner 100 may be inadvertently moved when it is installed.<br>
[19]	A plurality of louvers are provided for opening and closing the outlet O and<br>
controlling the direction of the air discharged through the outlet O . Therefore, the configurations for pivoting the louvers are required as many as the number of the louvers. Accordingly, there are disadvantages in that the number of parts constructing the article is increased and the man-hour needed for the works is also increased.<br>
[20]	In addition, while being connected to each other, the louvers pivot together. Thus, if<br>
any one of the louvers abnormally operates, the outlet O is not opened and the air-cleaner 100 cannot operate. That is, there is a problem in that the operational reliability of the air-cleaner 100 is deteriorated.<br>
[21]	As described above, the filter drawer 126 is shaped as a hexahedron of which the<br>
upper and both side faces are opened, so that the filters 122,123 and 124 can be mounted or dismounted through the opened faces and the air passing through the filters 122, 123 and 124 can flow through the opened faces. Thus, the filter drawer 126 itself or the filters 122, 123 and 124 may be damaged due to external forces exerted through both side faces of the filter drawer 126.<br>
[22]	In order to overcome the foregoing problem, there may be provided support ribs for<br>
connecting both ends of the front and rear surfaces of the filter drawer 126. However, when such a filter drawer 126 is provided with the support ribs, there is a disadvantage in that a core is needed in addition to two molds in order to injection mold the filter drawer 126.<br>
[23]	In addition, the fan housing 132 is fastened with screws to the bosses provided on<br>
the bottom surface of the blower case 112. Therefore, vibration generated when the blowing fan installed in the fan housing 132 operates is transmitted to the air-cleaner 100 and the refrigerator through the fan housing 132 and the bosses. Thus, due to the vibration generated when the air-cleaner operates, noise may occur indoors. In addition, due to the vibration, there are problems in that parts of the refrigerator or the air-cleaner 100 may be damaged or the fastened portions thereof are released, and thus, the durability of the article is deteriorated.<br>
[24]	In addition, the direction of the discharged air is controlled by allowing the louvers<br>
connected to each other to pivot together. Thus, there is a disadvantage in that various<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
directions of the discharged air cannot be embodied according to the use environment.<br>

[51]	Preferably, the louver blades are vertically installed side by side in each of at least<br>
two regions into which the outlet is divided, and upper and lower ends of the louver<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
blades installed in each region are connected to each other, respectively.<br>
[52]	More preferably, the louver blades installed in the respective regions are rotated se-<br>
lectively in the same or opposite directions.<br>
[53]	Furthermore preferably, the outlet is divided into a plurality of regions formed<br>
vertically stepwise. Advantageous Effects<br>
[54]	According to a refrigerator having an air-cleaner of the present invention so<br>
configured, the following advantages can be expected.<br>
[55]	First, the air-cleaner is mounted on a refrigerator main body using engaging pins<br>
fixed on the upper surface of the refrigerator main body and mounting brackets fixed on the bottom surface of air-cleaner. At this time, since an elasticity of the mounting brackets keeps the air-cleaner to be mounted on the main body, they can be more securely mounted to each other.<br>
[56]	In the meantime, an outlet of the air-cleaner is opened and closed by a decor panel<br>
which moves in a fore and aft direction of the air-cleaner. Thus, the number of parts necessary to open and close the outlet can be reduced, so that the article can be simple.<br>
[57]	Furthermore, the operation of the decor panel is simply obtained using a pair of<br>
combinations of a motor, a gear and a rack. Catching hook and stopper meshed with each other prevent the decor panel from being detached from the air-cleaner. Thus, it is possible to minimize the abnormal operation of the article, so that operational reliability of the article can be increased.<br>
[58]	Because of forcible operation of users or abnormal operation of the article, there are<br>
cases where the decor panel moves in a state where a portion of the decor panel protrudes to the front of the air-cleaner compared with the other portions thereof. At this time, by correcting the state of the decor panel, the article can normally operate.<br>
[59]	In addition, support ribs are provided on both side surfaces of a filter basket, which<br>
has openings for allowing the air passing through the filters for purifying air to flow. Therefore, there are advantages in that the filters can be protected and the filter basket is reinforced.<br>
[60]	Furthermore, the filter basket can be injection molded using two molds. Thus, it is<br>
possible to reduce the man-hour needed for the works and the manufacturing costs of the article.<br>
[61]	There are generated vibrations during the operation of a blower for sucking and<br>
discharging air into and out of the air-cleaner. However, a vibration prevention means prevents such vibrations from being transmitted to the outside. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the vibrations generated during the operation of the air-cleaner from generating noises or the durability of the article from being deteriorated.<br><br>
9<br>
WO 2005/124251 	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
[62]	In the meantime, the outlet is divided into a plurality of regions, and louver blades<br>
installed in each region are interconnected to each other. Therefore, various directions of the discharged air are embodied according to the respective regions of the outlet, so that it is possible to prevent the interference with obstacles positioned around the air-cleaner and to discharge the purified air into a broad space.

[92]	Support portions 216b are provided at rear and outer ends of the bottom surfaces of<br>
the filter cases 216. The support portions 216b serve to support the case 210 by allowing lower ends of the support portions 216b to be in close contact with the upper surface of the main body 20 when the air-cleaner 200 is seated on the upper surface of the main body 20.<br>
[93]	A filter unit 220, which will be described below, is detachably mounted in each of<br>
the filter cases 216 via the front face of the filter case 216. In addition, at least a fastening piece 217 is provided at a lower end of the inner end of each filter case 216. The fastening piece 217 enables the blower case 212 and the filter case 216 to be fastened to each other.<br>
[94]	The fastening piece 217 horizontally extends from the inner end of the bottom<br>
surface of the filter case 216 by a predetermined length. A fastening hole 217a is formed in the fastening piece 217. A fastener (not shown) penetrating the fastening hole 217a is selectively fastened to one of a plurality of fastening holes (not shown) formed in the bottom surface of the blower case 212. Thus, the width of the case 210 can be adjusted along the width of the upper surface of the main body 20. Here, the fastening holes formed in the bottom surface of the blower case 212 are positioned on the traces of the fastening holes 217a of the fastening piece 217 according to the movement of the filter case 216.<br>
[95]	Referring again to Fig. 2, there are provided the filter units 220 for purifying the air<br>

[99]	The first and second dust collection filters 223 and 224 perform the dust collection<br>
function, that is, serves to filter out dust from the air passing through the antibiotic filter 222. For example, the first dust collection filter 223 may be formed of a mesh for filtering out oil generated when meat or fish is broiled. Also, the second dust collection filter 224 may be formed by bonding a pair of meshes to each other, which filter out dusts with the different sizes, for example, a mesh for filtering out dust of 0.3 m or more and a mesh for filtering out dust of 0.3 m or less.<br>
[100]	The deodorizing filter 225 serves to remove odor in the air which passes through<br>
the first and second dust collection filters 223 and 224 and from which dusts are filtered out. The deodorizing filter 225 is generally formed of activated carbon and the like containing carbon. Also, antibiotic may be coated on the surface opposite to the surface of the deodorizing filter 225adjacent to the second dust collection filter 224.<br>

[134]	The fixing portions 262 are provided at both ends of the fastening portion 264. A<br>
fastening hole 263 is formed in each of the fixing portions 262. In a state where the mounting brackets 260 are seated in the seating portions 212a and 216a of the case 210, screws (not shown) penetrating through the fastening holes 263 are fastened into fastening holes (not shown) formed in the seating portions 212a and 216a.<br>
[135]	The fastening portion 264 is formed to be inclined at a predetermined angle with<br>
respect to the fixing portions 262. A passing hole 265 and an engaging slit 266 are formed in the fastening portion 264. The passing hole 265 is formed to have a shape corresponding to a head Ph of an engaging pin P fixed to the upper surface of the main body 20. The engaging slit 266 is in communication with the passing hole 265.<br>
[136]	In a state where the head Ph of the engaging pin P penetrates through the passing<br>
hole 265, a body Pb of the engaging pin P moves along the engaging slit 266. At this time, the elastic force with which the head Ph pushes the fastening portion 264 causes the fastening portion 264 to be fastened to the upper surface of the main body 20,<br>
fl 37]	Hereinafter, the operation of the refrigerator having the air-cleaner according to the<br>
present invention thus configured will be described.<br>
fl 38]	The process where the air-cleaner of the preferred embodiment of the refrigerator<br>
having the air-cleaner according to the present invention is mounted to the upper surface of the refrigerator main body will be described.<br>
[139]	First, the mounting brackets 260 are seated in the seating portions 212a and 216a of<br>
the case 210. Then, the fixing portions 262 of the mounting brackets 260 are fixed to the bottom surface of the case 210.<br>
[ 140]	Then, the head Ph of each engaging pin P provided on the upper surface of the main<br>
body 20 passes through each passing hole 265 formed on the fastening portion 264 of the mounting bracket 260. In such a state, the air-cleaner 200 is drawn to the front of the main body 20. Therefore, the body Pb of the engaging pin P moves along the engaging slit 266. At this time, the elastic force which causes the head Ph to push the fastening portion 264 causes the air-cleaner 200 to be mounted on the upper surface of the main body 20. In addition, the support portion 216b of the case 210 is brought into close contact with the upper surface of the main body 20, so that the air-cleaner 200 is supported.<br>
[141]	Since the mounting bracket 260 causes the air-cleaner 200 to be mounted on the<br>
upper surface of the main body 20 as described above, the air-cleaner 200 is more securely mounted. Further, a worker without a specific technique can also easily mount the air-cleaner 200 on the upper surface of the main body 20.<br>
[142]	Next, the operational process of such an air-cleaner will be described in detail with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
19<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
[143]	Fig. 12 shows an airflow state in the air-cleaner in the preferred embodiment of the<br>
refrigerator having the air-cleaner according to the present invention.<br>
[144]	As shown in the figure, a signal for operating the air-cleaner 200 is first input by<br>
operating the operating unit 256. If the operational signal is input as above, the step motors M cause the gears Gl to rotate. Then, the racks R engaged with the gears Gl move through the rack through-openings 251, Thus, the decor pane! 218 moves to the front of the case 210 and then the outlet O is opened.<br>
[145]	At this time, the catching hooks H also penetrate through the hook through-<br>
openings 251 a and then move to the front of the case 210. Then, when the catching hooks H move by a predetermined distance, the catching jaws h of the catching hooks K are brought into close contact with the distal ends of the stoppers S, respectively. Therefore, the decor panel 218 does not further move to the front of the case 210.<br>
[146]	That is, the decor panel 218 moves to the front of the case 210 by a distance<br>
between the catching jaw h of the catching hook H and the distal end of the stopper &amp;. Therefore, even though the step motor M is driven further than the preset value due to its malfunction, the decor panel 218 is not fully detached from the case 210.<br>
[147]	Further, when a user draws the decor panel 218 forcibly to the front of the case 210<br>
or pushes it to the rear of the case 210, it is difficult to uniformly apply external forces to both sides of the decor panel 218. Therefore, for example, the left side of the decor panel 218 moves more rapidly than the right side thereof, and thus, can protrude from the front surface of the case 210.<br>
[148]	Tn such a state, when the air-cleaner 200 operates by manipulating the operating<br>
unit 256, the step motors M are driven and thus the gears Gl rotate. Then, the racks R meshed with the gears G1 move. Therefore, the decor panel 218 moves to the front of the case 210, so that the outlet O is opened.<br>
[149]	However, since the decor panel 218 is in a state where the left side thereof<br>
protrudes relatively more than the right side thereof, the left side of the decor panel 218 stops by means of the catching hook jH and the stopper S earlier than the right side thereof. At this time, until the right side of the decor panel 218 stops by means of the catching hook H and the stopper S, the right side of the decor panel 218 continues to move to the front of the case 210. Therefore, any one side of the decor panel 218 does not protrude from the front surface of the case 210 and becomes parallel with the front surface of the case 210.<br>
[150]	When the blower 230 operates, air is sucked into the case 210 through the inlets I.<br>
At this time, the filtering nets of the suction grilles O Filter out relatively large dust of foreign materials from the air sucked through the inlets I. Then, the air passing through the filtering nets of the suction grilles O is purified while passing through the filters 222, 223, 224, and 225 in order.<br><br>
20<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
[151]	That is, while the air passes the antibiotic filters 222, dust is filtered out at the same<br>
time bacteria are eliminated. While the air passes through the first and second dust collection filters 223 and 224, oil generated when meat and fish is broiled and dust are filtered out. Then, the deodorizing filters 225 remove odor in the air. Also, antibiotic coated on the deodorizing filters 225 eliminates bacteria that are not eliminated in advance. Therefore, the filters 222, 223, 224, and 225 cause air to be purified more effectively.<br>
[152]	The air purified as above is guided to the blower 230 by the suction channel A,. At<br>
this time, the air passing through the filters 222, 223, 224, and 225 is introduced into the intake portion of the fan housing 232 via the space between the floor surface of the case 210 and the lower surface of the fan housing 232 that is defined by the support bosses 213.<br>
[ 153]	The continuous operation of the blower 230 causes the air introduced through the<br>
intake portion of the fan housing 232 to be discharged to the exhaust portion of the fan housing 232. The air discharged through the exhaust portion of the fan housing 232 is guided by the discharge channel B and then discharged into the interior of a room through the outlet O .<br>
[ 154]	At this time, the air discharged through the outlet O is discharged together with<br>
anions generated in the anion generator 240. In addition, the air discharged through the outlet O is guided by the rear surface of the decor panel 218 and thus discharged upwards and downwards.<br>
[155]	Meanwhile, in order to stop the operation of the air-cleaner 200, the operational<br>
signal is input by operating the operating unit 256. The input operational signal causes the blower 230 to stop. Thus, air is not sucked and discharged through the inlets I and the outlet O .<br>
[156]	The step motors M operate in a direction opposite to the direction in which they<br>
cause the decor panel 218 to move to the front of the case 210. Accordingly, the operation of the step motors M causes the gears G1 to rotate. Then, the rotation of the gears Gl causes the racks R to move to the rear of the case 210 through the rack through-openings 251.<br>
[ 157]	When the racks R move as above, the catching hooks H also move to the rear of the<br>
case 210. Therefore, the catchingjawsijare spaced apart from the distal ends of the stoppers S. from a state where the catching jaws ii are in close contact with the distal ends. Then, the decor panel 218 moves to the rear of the case 210. Therefore, the decor panel 218 closes the outlet O . At this time, the decor panel 218 is seated in the panel seating steps 259a, so that the decor panel 218 no more moves to the rear of the case 210.<br>
[158]	In the meantime, the shock absorbing portions 213a and the sealing portions 214a<br><br>
21<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
provided between the fan housing 232 and the support bosses 213 and side guides 214 absorb the vibrations generated from the operation of the blower 230. Therefore, the vibrations of the blower 230 are not transmitted to the outside through the case 210 and the refrigerator main body 20. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the operation of the air-cleaner from generating noises or the durability of the article from being deteriorated.<br>
[159]	Next, a process of manufacturing the filter basket of the preferred embodiment of<br>
the refrigerator having the air-cleaner according to the present invention will be described.<br>
[160]	The filter basket 228 is manufactured through an injection molding. However, the<br>
support ribs 229c and 229d are formed stepwise to the interior of the basket main body 229. Therefore, basket main body 229 and the support ribs 229c and 229d do not vertically overlap with each other.<br>
[161]	If it is designed in such a manner that the basket main body 229 and the support ribs<br>
229c and 229d do not vertically overlap with each other, an additional core except two molds consisting of upper and lower molds with respect to the parting line PR is not required, when the filter basket 228 is injection molded. Therefore, the man-hour needed for the works and the manufacturing costs of the article are reduced. Mode for the Invention<br>
[162]	Hereinafter, another embodiment of a refrigerator having an air-cleaner according<br>
to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[ 163]	Fig. 13 shows the other embodiment of the refrigerator having the air-cleaner<br>
according to the present invention, and Fig. 14 shows louver blades of the embodiment shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[ 164]	As shown in the figures, a freezing chamber F and a refrigerating chamber £ are<br>
defined side by side in a refrigerator main body 2. A freezing chamber door 4 and a refrigerating chamber door 6 for selectively opening and closing the freezing chamber F and the refrigerating chamber R are pivotably installed on the front surface of the main body 2 through hinge assemblies 4a and 6a.<br>
[165]	An air-cleaner 10 is provided on the upper surface of the main body 2. An external<br>
appearance of the air-cleaner 10 is defined by a case 12. The case 12 is formed with inlets I and an outlet O . A plurality of louver blades B1 and B2 are installed in regions A and B of the outlet O , respectively, in order to embody various directions of the discharged air in the respective regions A and B.<br>
[ 166]	The inlets I are provided in both side surface of the case 12, while the outlet O is<br>
provided in the front surface of the case 12. The case 12 includes therein filter units<br><br>
22<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
(not shown) for filtering the air sucked through the inlets I, a blower (not shown) for sucking the air through the inlets I and discharging the air purified in the filter units through the outlet O , and an anion generator (not shown) for generating anions that are discharged along with the air through the outlet O . In addition, the case 12 includes therein a controller (not shown) for supplying the various parts with power and controlling the operation thereof.<br>
[ 167]	Furthermore, it is preferred that air guides (not shown) for guiding the flow of the<br>
air blown by the blower be provided in the case 12. Each inlet I is provided with a suction grille G. The outlet O is equipped with a plurality of the louver blades Bl and B2 that are vertically in parallel.<br>
[168]	As shown in Fig, 13, the louver blades Bl and B2 consist of a plurality of the first<br>
louver blades B1 installed in the region A of the outlet O to be connected to each other and a plurality of the second louver blades B2 installed in the other region B. of the outlet O to be connected to each other. It is preferred that the first louver blades Bl cooperate with each other separately from the second louver blades B2 cooperating with each other so that the directions of the air discharged from the respective regions A and B of the outlet O can be controlled independently of each other.<br>
[169]	Here, upper and lower ends of the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 are<br>
installed in the regions A and B of the outlet O , respectively so that the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 are rotatable in the respective regions. The first louver blades B1 are connected to one another by means of rotating links 14a and a pair of levers 16a to cooperate with one another, while the second louver blades B2 are connected to one another by means of rotating links 14b and a pair of levers 16b to cooperate with one another. A set of the first louver blades Bl, the rotating links 14a and the pair of levers 16a and another set of the second louver blades and B2, the rotating links 14b and the pair of levers 16b may be installed to be connected to one another by means of a variety of assembly grooves and protrusions, assembly screws, or the like.<br>
[170]	At this time, at least one of the rotating links 14a connected to the first louver<br>
blades Bl is connected to an additional first step motor (not shown). At least one of the rotating links 14b connected to the second louver blades B2 is connected to an additional second step motor (not shown). The first and second step motors are connected to the controller for supplying power and controlling the operation. A user may rotate the first and second louver blades B1 and B2 by hand to adjust them.<br>
[171]	According to user s selection, the controller controls the first and second louver<br>
blades Bl and B2. At this time, by controlling the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 to rotate in the same direction, the controller can control the purified air to be discharged from the outlet O only in the same direction. Further, by controlling the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 to rotate in the opposite directions, the<br><br>
23<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
controller can control the purified air to be discharged from the outlet O in two directions at a time.<br>
[172]	In the meantime, there are provided a plurality of the outlets O vertically stepwise<br>
formed. A plurality of the louver blades are vertically installed side by side in the stepwise outlets O . For example, there are the upper and lower outlets O , the louver blades in each outlet may be installed to cooperate with each other. In such a case, the louver blades installed in the upper outlet rotate in a direction to discharge the purified air in the direction, while the louver blades installed in the lower outlet rotate in the direction opposite to that of the air discharged from the upper outlet to discharge the purified air in the opposite direction. The louver blades installed in the upper and lower outlets may be divided into regions, and the louver blades in each region may cooperate with each other. Thus, a variety of directions of discharged air can be embodied in the respective outlets at a time.<br>
f 173]	Hereinafter, the operation of the other embodiment of the refrigerator having the<br>
air-cleaner according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[174]	Figs. 15 to 17 show the operational states of the louver blades of the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[175]	First, when a user operates the air-cleaner 10, the blower operates. Therefore, air is<br>
sucked in the case 12 through the inlets I of the case 12. The air sucked in the case 12 is purified while passing the filter units.<br>
[ 176]	Then, the continuous operation of the blower causes the air along with anions<br>
generated in the anion generator to be discharged indoors through the outlet O of the case 12. At this time, the directions of the discharged air can be controlled according to the rotation directions of the respective first and second louver blades B1 and B2 installed in both the regions A and 13 of the outlet O of the case 12<br>
[177]	In detail, obstacles such as other electric home appliances or walls may be<br>
positioned in a side of the front of the air-cleaner 10, i.e., to the right or left side in the figures. In such a case, as shown in Fig. 15 or 16, the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 are caused to rotate in the direction opposite to that in which the obstacles are positioned, i.e., to the left or right side in the figures. Therefore, the purified air discharged from the respective regions A and JS of the outlet O is discharged in the direction so as not to interfere with the obstacles.<br>
[178]	In the meantime, obstacles may be positioned in the middle of a front region of the<br>
air-cleaner 10. In such a case, as shown in Fig. 17, the first and second louver blades Bl and B2 are caused to rotate in opposite directions, i.e., to the right and the left side in the figures. Therefore, the purified air discharged from the respective regions A and B. of the outlet O is discharged in both directions so as not to interfere with the<br><br>
24<br>
WO 2005/124251	PCT/KR2005/001829<br>
obstacles, thereby effectively supplying the purified air to a broader space.<br>
[179]	It will be apparent that those skilled in the art can make various modifications<br>
thereto within the scope of the fundamental technical spirit of the present invention.<br>
The true scope of the present invention should be defined on the basis of the appended<br>
