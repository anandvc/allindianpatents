				<td>APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING MOLTEN IRON AND<br>
METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing molten iron<br>
and a method for manufacturing the same, and more particularly, to an apparatus<br>
for manufacturing molten irons by charging carbonaceous materials and iron<br>
carriers into a melter-gasifier and injecting fine carbonaceous materials into the<br>
melter-gasifier and a method for manufacturing molten irons using the same.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
The iron and steel industry is a core industry that supplies the basic<br>
materials needed in construction and in the manufacture of automobiles, ships,<br>
home appliances, etc. Further, it is an industry which has the longest history<br>
having advanced since the dawn of human history. Iron works, which play a<br>
pivotal roll in the iron and steel industry, produce steel from molten iron, and then<br>
supply it to customers, after first producing the molten iron (i.e., pig iron in a<br>
molten state) using iron ores and coals as raw materials.<br>
Nowadays, approximately 60% of the world's iron production is produced<br>
using a blast furnace method that has been developed since the 14th century.<br>
According to the blast furnace method, irons ores, which have gone through a<br>
sintering process, and cokes, which are produced using bituminous coals as raw<br>
materials, are charged into a blast furnace together and oxygen is supplied to the<br>
blast furnace to reduce the iron ores to irons, thereby manufacturing molten irons.<br>
The blast furnace method, which is the most popular in plants for manufacturing<br>
molten irons, requires that raw materials have strength of at least a predetermined<br>
level and have grain sizes that can ensure permeability in the furnace, taking into<br>
account reaction characteristics. For that reason, cokes that are obtained by<br>
processing specific raw coals are needed as carbon sources to be used as a fuel and<br>
as a reducing agent. Also, sintered ores that have gone through a successive<br>
agglomerating process are needed as iron sources. Accordingly, the modern blast<br>
furnace method requires rav material preliminary processing equipment, such as<br>
coke manufacturing equipment and sintering equipment. Namely, it is necessary<br>
to be equipped with subsidiary facilities in addition to the blast furnace, and also<br>
equipment for preventing ar d minimizing pollution generated by the subsidiary<br>
facilities. Therefore, the heavy investment in the additional facilities and<br>
equipment leads to increased manufacturing costs.<br>
In order to solve these problems with the blast furnace method, significant<br>
effort is made in iron works all over the world to develop a smelting reduction<br>
process that produces molten irons in the melter-gasifier by directly using general<br>
coals as a fuel and as a reducing agent and by directly using iron ores as iron<br>
sources.<br>
Since a coal packed bed consisting of coals is formed in the melter-gasifier,<br>
iron carriers and additives are melted and slagged in the coal packed bed, and are<br>
discharged as molten irons and slags. The oxygen is injected into the<br>
melter-gasifier through a plurality of tuyeres installed on the outer wall of the<br>
melter-gasifier, and burns the coal packed bed. Therefore, the oxygen is converted<br>
into a hot reducing gas and the hot reducing gas is supplied to the fluidized bed<br>
reactor. The hot reducing gas reduces and sinters iron carriers and additives and is<br>
discharged outside.<br>
The lumped coals charged into the upper portion of the melter-gasifier are<br>
differentiated due to the sudden thermal shock while falling in a dome portion of<br>
the melter-gasifier that is mainlained at a hot temperature of about 1000Â°C. In this<br>
case, a large amount of dust containing a large amount of carbon components is<br>
generated. Therefore, the permeability of the melter-gasifier is deteriorated due to<br>
the large amount of dust. For solving this problem, a dust burner is installed in<br>
the upper portion of the melter- gasifier and burns the dust while oxygen is injected<br>
to the melter-gasifier by the dust burner. By burning the dust, the combustion<br>
heat of the carbon components contained in the dust can be used.<br>
Meanwhile, lumped coals are charged into the melter-gasifier and are<br>
rapidly heated in the dome portion thereof. The volatile matters contained in the<br>
lumped coals are firstly pyrolyzed as a pyrolysis gas having a chain structure of<br>
CnHm or as a tar phase having a ring structure. The volatile matters are first<br>
pyrolyzed and are then re pyrolyzed into a reducing gas, such as a CO gas and a<br>
H2 gas. The heat, which is necessary for the pyrolyzing process, is absorbed<br>
during the process, and thereby the temperature of the dome portion is lowered.<br>
Therefore, extra oxygen, in addition to the oxygen which is necessary for burning<br>
the dust, is supplied by a dust burner or an oxygen burner in order to prevent a<br>
lowering of the temperature. A portion of the reducing gas formed in the dome<br>
portion of the melter-gasifier is burned by supplying the extra oxygen, and so<br>
prevents a lowering of the temperature thereof. However, in spite of such<br>
combustion, a portion of the coal pyrolysis gas or the tar is not completely<br>
pyrolyzed into CO2 and H2. Therefore, a portion of gas containing depyrolyzed<br>
hydrocarbon, such as CH4, is contained in the reducing gas discharged from the<br>
melter-gasifier.<br>
As described above, when the lumped coals are charged into the<br>
melter-gasifier, the combustion heat of the carbon contained in the volatile matters<br>
is mainly used in pyrolysis of the gas generated from the volatile matters<br>
themselves and raises he temperature of the pyrolysis gas. Carbonaceous<br>
materials are partly discharged out of the melter-gasifier without generating<br>
combustion heat. Therefore, only the amount of carbonaceous materials<br>
excepting the amount of carbon contained in the volatile matters among the entire<br>
amount of carbonaceous materials contained in the lumped coals is burned in the<br>
lower portion of the melter-gasifier. Accordingly, carbonaceous materials in an<br>
amount more than actually necessary should be used in order to supply a<br>
sufficient heat source for manufacturing molten irons. Meanwhile, depyrolyzed<br>
hydrocarbon gas, such a: a CH4, is discharged from the melter-gasifier while partly<br>
existing in the reducing gas. In addition, the reducing gas containing CO2 and<br>
H2O is partly discharged since the excessive oxygen is injected through the dust<br>
burner. Therefore, there s a problem in that a reduction power of the reducing<br>
gas supplied to the reduction reactor is deteriorated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with<br>
reference to Figs. 1 to 6. The emlbodiments of the present invention are merely to<br>
illustrate the present invention and the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a process of injecting fine carbonaceous materials<br>
into a melter-gasifier 20 Here, carbonaceous materials mean materials containing<br>
carbon. The fine carbonaceous. materials are injected with oxygen into the<br>
melter-gasifier 20 through tuyeres 202.<br>
The upper portion 206 of the melter-gasifier 20 is dome-shaped, which is<br>
different from that of 1 blast furnace. The dome-shaped upper portion 206 is<br>
located above a coal packed bed of the melter-gasifier 20. The volume V2 of the<br>
coal packed bed formed in the melter-gasifier 20 is formed to be smaller than the<br>
volume V1 of the dome-shaped upper portion 206. Due to such a structure, the<br>
dome-shaped upper portion 206 decreases a flow rate of gas. Therefore, dust<br>
contained in the reduced materials charged into the melter-gasifier 20 and dust<br>
generated due to a rapid rising temperature of the coals in the coal packed bed are<br>
prevented from discharging out of the melter-gasifier 20.<br>
Since the coals are directly used in the melter-gasifier 20, the amount of<br>
generated gas is irregularly varied. The dome-shaped upper portion 206 absorbs<br>
a varying pressure in the melter-gasifier 20 caused by the above circumstance.<br>
For this, the dome-shaped upper portion 206 of the melter-gasifier 20 is<br>
pressurized and maintained, and is maintained at a hot temperature in the range<br>
from 900Â°C to 1100Â°C. Sir ce the dome-shaped upper portion 206 is maintained at<br>
a hot temperature, tar components generated during a process of removing volatile<br>
matters of coals can be completely decomposed.<br>
The reduced irons are converted into molten irons and molten slags while<br>
falling in the coal packed bed. Therefore, a char bed containing a large amount of<br>
char is formed below the coal packed bed. Here, char means a material after the<br>
coal is gasified. As shown in Fig. 1, the coal packed bed is defined to contain a<br>
char bed for convenience. The chars are burned by oxygen injected through the<br>
tuyeres 202 and are destroyed. Therefore, the balance between the volume of<br>
mixtures containing coals, reduced irons, and additives, and that of chars which<br>
are burned and destroyed in the lower portion of the melter-gasifier should be set<br>
in order to uniformly maintain the volume of the coal packed bed. For this, it is<br>
preferable that the structure of the coal packed bed has a large upper portion and a<br>
small lower portion. That is, it is preferable that the upper portion of the coal<br>
packed bed is large while the lower portion is small. According to the present<br>
invention, the melter-gasifier 20 is pressurized since extra reducing gas is<br>
generated by injecting fine carbonaceous materials.<br>
Since the blast furnace has a structure which is completely different from<br>
that of the above described melter-gasifier 20, there is a big difference in the<br>
mechanism of manufacturi ng molten irons. The structure of a blast furnace has a<br>
small upper portion and a large lower portion. That is, the upper portion of the<br>
blast furnace is small while the lower portion is large. Therefore, the structure of<br>
the blast furnace is essentially different from that of the melter-gasifier 20 for<br>
generating a large amount of reducing gas.<br>
In the blast furnace method, molten irons are manufactured by using<br>
sintered ores and cokes having enhanced strength by previously removing volatile<br>
matters. Therefore, since gas is not generated from the volatile matters, the<br>
internal portion of the blast furnace is maintained at a pressure not more than 2<br>
atmospheric pressures. Sime gas is not generated from the volatile matters, the<br>
amount of the reducing gas is not increased and only heat is supplied instead of<br>
cokes even though pulverize i coals are injected into the blast furnace. In addition,<br>
the heat exchange between g is and solids in the cokes and sintered ores packed up<br>
to the upper portion of the b ast furnace is sufficiently carried out. Therefore, the<br>
temperature of gas discharged from the upper portion of the blast furnace is<br>
maintained at not more than 200Â°C.<br>
According to the present invention, volatile matters contained in fine<br>
carbonaceous materials and carbonaceous materials contained in fixed carbon are<br>
burned by injecting the fine carbonaceous materials. A combustion heat, which is<br>
generated when carbonaceous materials are burned, is used in manufacturing<br>
molten irons. In addition, a large amount of hot reducing gases containing only<br>
CO and H2 are generated by lot burning fine carbonaceous materials. The large<br>
amount of hot reducing gases passes through the coal packed bed formed in the<br>
melter-gasifier 20 and then is s upplied to the dome portion of the melter-gasifier 20.<br>
Therefore, the consuming energy for pyrolyzing lumped carbonaceous materials<br>
which are charged into the me ter-gasifier 20 is supplied. Furthermore, a quantity<br>
of the lumped carbonaceous materials, which are charged into the melter-gasifier<br>
20, is decreased by injecting the fine carbonaceous materials. According to the<br>
present invention, which is different from a pulverized coal injection process, fine<br>
carbonaceous materials containing a large amount of volatile matters are injected<br>
into the melter-gasifier 20 and then increase an amount of reducing gas.<br>
As the fine carbonaceous materials are injected, an amount of extra oxygen<br>
supplied through a dust burner or an oxygen burner installed in the dome portion<br>
of the melter-gasifier can be decreased. Therefore, a burning amount of the<br>
reducing gas and an amount of depyrolyzed hydrocarbon in the dome portion are<br>
decreased, too.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the lumped carbonaceous materials are charged into the<br>
upper portion of the melter-gasifier 20, and thereby a coal packed bed is formed<br>
therein. The lumped carbonaceous materials are also used as a healing source for<br>
melting reduced materials. The lumped carbonaceous materials may include<br>
lumped coals or coal briquette s.<br>
According to the present invention, lumped carbonaceous materials<br>
containing 20.0~35.0 wt% of volatile matters are used. Here, the volatile matters<br>
include carbon and hydrogen If the amount of volatile matters contained in the<br>
lumped carbonaceous materia is Â°C is less than 20.0 wt%, there is a problem in that<br>
an amount of reducing gas generated in the melter-gasifier 20 is considerably less<br>
than that consumed for reduction of the reduced materials in the reduction reactor<br>
52. In addition, if the amount of volatile matters contained in the lumped<br>
carbonaceous materials is more than 35.0 wt%, it is difficult to use them for<br>
manufacturing molten irons. General coals, such as semi-bituminous coals, are<br>
used as the lumped carbonaceous materials. The lumped carbonaceous materials<br>
can be obtained by dividing raw coals and it is preferable that the grain size<br>
thereof is in the range from 8 mm to 35 mm. If the grain size of the lumped<br>
carbonaceous materials is less 1 han 8mm,, it is impossible to secure permeability in<br>
the melter-gasifier. In addition, if lumped carbonaceous materials of which the<br>
grain size is more than 35 mm are manufactured, yield efficiency is deteriorated.<br>
Meanwhile, the mixture containing iron ores is reduced in the reduction<br>
reactor 52. The reduced materials are charged into the melter-gasifier and molten<br>
irons are manufactured.<br>
The reducing gas is mam factured by using volatile matters contained in fine<br>
carbonaceous materials in add tion to volatile matters contained in the lumped<br>
carbonaceous materials. Therefore, a reducing gas having improved reduction<br>
power can be supplied to the reduction reactor, and thereby the reduction ratio of<br>
the reduced materials can be considerably increased. Subsequently, the fuel ratio<br>
of the melter-gasifier 20 can go down considerably.<br>
The fine carbonaceous materials are transferred to a front end of the tuyere<br>
by air and are injected into the tuyere. Therefore, an amount of moisture<br>
contained in the fine carbonaceous materials is controlled to be not more than 2.0<br>
wt% in order to be suitable for being transferred by air. It is preferable that the<br>
fine carbonaceous materials contain volatile matters in the range from 8.0 wt% to<br>
35.0 wt%. Here, the volatile matters contain carbon and hydrogen. If the amount<br>
of volatile matters contained in the fine carbonaceous materials is less than 8.0 wt%,<br>
the generating amount of the extra reducing gas due to the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials is not significant. In addition, the fine carbonaceous materials are dried<br>
while being transferred by air, and so it is difficult for a content of the volatile<br>
matters to be more than 35.0 wt%. Semi-anthracite coals or semi-bituminous coals,<br>
of which the content of volatile matters is not more than 35.0 wt%, can be used as<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials.<br>
Meanwhile, the grair size of the fine carbonaceous materials is limited<br>
during injection of the fine carbonaceous materials in order for the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials injecting line not to be blocked. The fine carbonaceous<br>
materials are crushed in order for the grain size thereof to be not more than 3.0mm.<br>
Then, the carbonaceous materials can be used. In addition, fine carbonaceous<br>
materials, of which the free swelling index is not more than 6.0, are used in order<br>
for the tuyere not to be blocked by the fine carbonaceous materials. As the free<br>
swelling index grows high, a coking power is increased, and thereby adhesion of<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials is serious. Since the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
of which the free swelling index is not less than 6.0 are stuck to each other in a<br>
drying process, it is difficult to crush them into the grain size suitable for being<br>
transferred by air. In additic n, the fine carbonaceous materials supplying line can<br>
be blocked by sticking while being transferred by air.<br>
Oxygen is supplied to the melter-gasifier 20 through the tuyeres 202<br>
installed in a lower portion thereof and the coal packed bed is heated to a hot<br>
temperature by using combustion heat of the char by the oxygen. The tuyeres 202<br>
are connected to the fine carbonaceous materials supplying line 113, and<br>
pulverized coals are supplied to the tuyeres 202 from the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials supplying device 10. The pulverized coals with the oxygen are injected<br>
into the coal packed bed through the tuyeres 202.<br>
In this case, the lengthed of a raceway 204 ahead of each tuyere 202 is in the<br>
range from 0.7 m to 1.0 m. If the length d of the raceway 204 is less than 0.7m,<br>
there is a possibility that a nose of the tuyere 202 gets damaged since the length of<br>
the raceway 204 is too shor . In addition, if the length d of the raceway 204 is<br>
more than 1.0 m, chars are broken due to an increased flow rate. Since the oxygen<br>
is supplied through the tuyere 202, (he length d of the raceway 204 is relatively<br>
short.<br>
In a method for manufacturing molten irons directly using reduced<br>
materials containing iron ores and carbonaceous materials, a plurality of<br>
advantages can be obtained by injecting fine carbonaceous materials with oxygen<br>
into the coal packed bed. That is, when fine carbonaceous materials are injected<br>
into the melter-gasifier 20 through the tuyere 202, the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
are burned and volatile matters contained therein are also burned. Therefore,<br>
utilization efficiency of the carbon is enhanced and the amount of reducing gas is<br>
increased, thereby the reduction ratio of the reduced materials containing iron ores<br>
is enhanced. Therefore, fuel ratio can be reduced. In addition, since a generation<br>
of CH4 gas can be prevented by complete combustion, an oxidization ratio can be<br>
improved even though an amount of CH4 gas is decreased.<br>
According to the present invention, reducing gas having a decreased<br>
oxidation ratio can be supplied from the melter-gasifier 20 to the reduction reactors<br>
52 by injecting fine carbonaceous materials, thereby enhancing a reduction ratio of<br>
the reduced materials. That is, when the fine carbonaceous materials are injected<br>
into the melter-gasifier 20 through the tuyere 202 installed therein, the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials directly come in contact with the hot raceway in the<br>
melter-gasifier 20 and are burned. Therefore, volatile matters containing fine<br>
carbonaceous materials are completely decomposed into carbon (C), hydrogen (H2),<br>
and oxygen (O2), and thereby the generated amount of CH4 due to incomplete<br>
burning is not large. In addition, a large amount of CO gas and H2 gas for<br>
reduction is generated by the reaction such as in the following Chemical Formula<br>
1.<br>
[Chemical Formula 1]<br>
C + CO2 â 2CO<br>
C + H2O â H2 + CO<br>
Therefore, a reducing gas having a decreased oxidation ratio can be supplied<br>
from the melter-gasifier to the reduction reactors due to a large amount of CO gas<br>
and H2 gas, thereby reducing the mixtlure containing iron ores and then converting<br>
it into the reduced materials. Since the mixture containing iron ores can include<br>
additives, it can help the reduced materials to be sintered.<br>
Meanwhile, when fine carbonaceous materials are injected into the<br>
melter-gasifier 20, a combustion temperature in the melter-gasifier 20 can be<br>
decreased since volatile matters contained in the carbonaceous materials are<br>
pyrolyzed. By using this method, there is an advantage that not only the furnace<br>
heat of the melter-gasifier can be easily controlled but also a Si content of the<br>
molten irons can be reduced<br>
In the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 100 shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
fine carbonaceous materials, which are injected with oxygen, can be manufactured<br>
by going through the following processes. The fine carbonaceous materials are<br>
manufactured by crushing raw coals collected from a producing district and the<br>
crushed fine carbonaceous materials are transferred to the installation for injecting<br>
oxygen. Next, the fine carbonaceous materials are mixed with oxygen and are<br>
injected into the coal packed bed of the melter-gasifier 20. The injection of the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials is carried out by the fine carbonaceous materials supplying<br>
device 10.<br>
The structure of the fire carbonaceous materials supplying device 10 shown<br>
in Fig. 1 is merely to illustrate the present invention, and the present invention is<br>
not limited thereto. Therefore, the fine carbonaceous materials can be supplied to<br>
the melter-gasifier 20 using )ther fine carbonaceous materials supplying devices<br>
having a modified structure The structure of the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
supplying device 10 will be explained in more detail below.<br>
The fine carbonaceous materials supplying device 10 includes a raw coals<br>
storage bin 101, a mill 102, a fine carbonaceous materials storage bin 104, a<br>
pressure balancing supplying device 110, a divider 108, and a fine carbonaceous<br>
materials supplying line 112. Besides, the fine carbonaceous materials supplying<br>
device 10 can also include other devices, if necessary.<br>
The raw coals storage bin 101 stores raw coals: A plurality of raw coals<br>
storage bins 101 can be installed. In this case, coals of various types of which<br>
producing districts are different from each other can be stored in each raw coals<br>
storage bin 101, respectively, and can be used.<br>
The mill 102 is connec ted to the raw coals storage bin 101 and crushes the<br>
raw coals and manufactures the fine carbonaceous materials. The grain size of the<br>
crushed fine carbonaceous materials is preferably not more than 3mm. If the<br>
grain size of the fine carbonaceous materials is more than 3mm the tuyere 202 may<br>
be dangerously blocked during injection of the fine carbonaceous materials. The<br>
fine carbonaceous materials srorage bin 104 is connected to the mill 102 and stores<br>
the crushed and manufactured fine carbonaceous materials.<br>
The pressure balancing supplying device 110 supplies a suitable amount of<br>
fine carbonaceous materials from the fine carbonaceous materials storage bin 104<br>
to the melter-gasifier 20. For this, the pressure balancing supplying device 110<br>
includes a uniformly pressurizing vessel 103, a pressurizing and discharging vessel<br>
105, isolation valves 107 and 109, and a suitable amount supplying device. The<br>
uniformly pressurizing vessel 103 and the pressuring and discharging vessel 105<br>
are located up and down, and control a supplying amount of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials which are crushed and manufactured by using the isolation valves 107<br>
and 109.<br>
Considering that the pressure in the melter-gasifier 20 is high, the divider<br>
108 is located above the upper portion of the melter-gasifier 20. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to sufficiently secure the pressure in the divider 108 for injecting the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials into the melter-gasifier 20 while the supplying amount of<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials is controlled. The fine carbonaceous materials<br>
supplying line 113 is connected to the pressure balancing supplying device 110<br>
through the divider 108 and supplies the fine carbonaceous materials to the tuyeres<br>
202.<br>
A plurality of tuyeres 202 and a plurality of dividers 108 can be installed. A<br>
plurality of dividers 108 are connected to a plurality of tuyeres 202, respectively,<br>
and the fine carbonaceous materials are uniformly supplied to each divider 108<br>
and are supplied to the tayeres 202, respectively. The pressure balancing<br>
supplying device 110 uniformly supplies the fine carbonaceous materials to the<br>
divider 108.<br>
Since the detailed internal structure of the above described devices can be<br>
understood by those skilled ir the art in the technical field of the present invention,<br>
the detailed explanation there of will be omitted.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the raw coals are divided<br>
and are used as pulverized coals which are injected into the melter-gasifier 20.<br>
The above second embodiment of the present invention will be explained in more<br>
detail with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Since the structure of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 200<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 2 is<br>
similar to that of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons according to the<br>
first embodiment of the present invention, the same elements are referred to with<br>
the same reference numerals and a detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
The raw coals are divided into lumped coals and fine coals by a screen 111.<br>
The raw coals having a grain size of not less than 8 mm are divided into lumped<br>
coals and the raw coals having a grain size of less than 8 mm are divided into fine<br>
coals. The above grain size standard is merely to illustrate the present invention<br>
and the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, the raw coals can be<br>
divided based on another grain size standard.<br>
The lumped coals come in contact with a hot gas and are dried in the dryer<br>
115. The dried lumped coals are charged into the melter-gasifier 20. The dryer<br>
115 dries the lumped coals using heat recovery which is generated from the<br>
melter-gasifier 20. Besides, the lumped coals can be dried using other methods.<br>
The fine coals are collected when the lumped coals come in contact with the<br>
hot gas in the dryer 115 and are then transferred to the raw coals storage bin 101<br>
via a fine coals transferring line 121. Therefore, collected fine coals can be injected<br>
into the melter-gasifier 20 as he pulverized coals. The fine coals divided from the<br>
raw coals can be used as the pulverized coals. Therefore, the apparatus for<br>
manufacturing molten irons 200 can use the fine coals generated from the raw<br>
coals for pulverized coal injection (PCI) beside the raw coals, and thereby there is<br>
an advantage that utilization efficiency of the fine coals can be maximized.<br>
The reducing gas generated from the melter-gasifier 20 is supplied to the<br>
packed bed reactor 52 via a reducing gas supplying line 70. The reduced<br>
materials reduced in the packed bed reactor 52 are supplied to the melter-gasifier<br>
20 and are melted therein.<br>
An apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 300 according to a third<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 3 includes an apparatus for<br>
manufacturing coal briquettes 30. Coal briquettes manufactured in the apparatus<br>
for manufacturing coal briquettes 30 are charged into the melter-gasifier 20. Since<br>
the other portions of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 300, except the<br>
apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 30, are similar to those of the<br>
apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 100 according to the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the detailed explanation thereof will be omitted and the<br>
same elements are referred to with the same reference numerals.<br>
The apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 300 supplies fine coals to the<br>
melter-gasifier 20 using the fine carbonaceous materials supplying device shown in<br>
Fig. 1. The fine carbonaceous materials supplying device is omitted in Fig. 3 for<br>
convenience.<br>
The apparatus for manufacturing coal briquettes 30 molds fine coals and<br>
then manufactures coal briquettes as a heating source in order to melt the reduced<br>
materials. The raw coals are divided into lumped coals having a large grain size<br>
and fine coals having a small grain size by a selector 40. The lumped coals are<br>
directly charged into the melter-gasifier 20 after they are dried in the lumped coals<br>
dryer 42. The fine coals are manufactured into coal briquettes in order to secure<br>
permeability in the melter-gasifier 20 and are charged into the melter-gasifier 20.<br>
Here, raw coals are divided into the lumped coals having a grain size more than<br>
8mm and fine coals having a grain size not more than 8mm based on the grain size<br>
standard of 8mm. The above grain size standard is merely to illustrate the present<br>
invention and the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, it is possible<br>
for the lumped coals and fine coals to be divided using other grain size standards.<br>
Lumped carbonaceous materials including the lumped coals and the coal<br>
briquettes manufactured by molding the fine coals are prepared. The lumped<br>
carbonaceous materials are charged into the melter-gasifier 20 and the coal packed<br>
bed is formed. Here, a step of preparing the lumped carbonaceous materials<br>
includes a step of dividing raw coals into lumped coals and fine coals and a step of<br>
manufacturing coal briquettes by molding the fine coals.<br>
The step of manufacturing the coal briquettes includes a step of dividing<br>
raw coals into lumped coals and fine coals, a step of drying the fine coals, a step of<br>
adding a binder to the fine coals and mixing together, and a step of molding the<br>
fine coals in which the binder s added and mixed together and manufacturing the<br>
coal briquettes.<br>
In order to realize the above process, the apparatus for manufacturing coal<br>
briquettes 30 may further include a dryer 33, a mixer 37, and a couple of rolls 39.<br>
Besides, it may further include a fine coals storage bin 31, a binder storage bin 35, a<br>
coal briquettes storage bin 44, and so on.<br>
The dryer 33 dries the fine coals. The mixer 37 is connected to the dryer 33<br>
and mixes a binder, which is supplied from the binder storage bin 35, and the<br>
dried fine coals together. The couple of rolls 39 are connected to the mixer 37 and<br>
manufacture coal briquettes by molding the fine coals with which the binder is<br>
mixed together.<br>
The fine coals storage bin 31 temporarily stores the fine coals and the binder<br>
storage bin 35 stores a binder such as molasses. In addition, the coal briquettes<br>
storage bin 44 temporarily stores the manufactured coal briquettes. Besides, other<br>
devices, which are necessary for manufacturing coal briquettes, such as a dust<br>
separator, can also be included if necessary.<br>
Particularly, accor ling to the present invention, molten irons can be<br>
manufactured directly us;ng the fine raw coals and fine iron ores. The method for<br>
manufacturing molten irons will be explained in detail with reference to Fig. 4<br>
below.<br>
As shown in Fig.4, molten irons can be manufactured directly using fine<br>
raw coals and fine iron ores. Fig. 4 shows an apparatus for manufacturing molten<br>
irons 400 according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention for carrying<br>
out the above described Process. The structure of the apparatus for manufacturing<br>
molten irons 400 shown in Fig. 4 is merely to illustrate the present invention and<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, it can be modified in other<br>
structures and other devices can be included.<br>
Since the structurr of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 400 is<br>
similar to the structure c f the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons shown in<br>
Fig. 3, the same element are referred to with the same reference numerals and the<br>
detailed explanation thereof will bo omitted.<br>
The apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 400 mainly include a<br>
fluidized bed reactor 5C as a reduction reactor, an apparatus for manufacturing<br>
coal briquettes 30, a melter-gasifier 20, a fine carbonaceous materials supplying<br>
device 10 (shown in Fig. 1) and a reducing gas supplying line 70. Besides, the<br>
apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 400 may further include an apparatus<br>
for manufacturing compacted irons 60 connected between the fluidized bed reactor<br>
50 and the melter-gasifier 20. In addition, the apparatus for manufacturing<br>
molten irons 400 can include other devices necessary to manufacture molten irons.<br>
The multi-stage f uidized bed reactors in which fluidized beds are formed<br>
are sequentially connect ed to each other in order to reduce the mixtures containing<br>
iron ores and convert them into reduced materials. The reducing gas, which is<br>
discharged from the coal packed bed of the melter-gasifier 20, is supplied to each<br>
fluidized bed reactor via a reducing gas supplying line 70. The reducing gas<br>
enters into the fluidized bed reactors and flows (herein, thereby iron-ores and<br>
additives pass through them and are converted into reduced materials. The<br>
reduced materials may be compacted by the apparatus for manufacturing<br>
compacted irons 60. Such nanufactured reduced materials are charged into the<br>
melter-gasifier 20 and are manufactured into molten irons.<br>
The apparatus for manufacturing compacted irons 60 compacts reduced<br>
materials and then manufactures compacted reduced materials in order to secure<br>
permeability and to prevent them from elutriating. The apparatus for<br>
manufacturing compacted irons 60 includes a charging hopper 62, a couple of rolls<br>
64, a crusher 66, and a reduced materials storage bin 68. Besides, the apparatus<br>
for manufacturing compactec irons 60 may include other devices if necessary.<br>
The charging hopper (2 stores reduced materials which are reduced from<br>
the mixture containing iron ores. The couple of rolls 64 presses the reduced<br>
materials and manufactures compacted reduced materials. The crusher 66 crushes<br>
the compacted reduced materials into a suitable size. The reduced materials<br>
storage bin 68 temporarily stores the crushed reduced materials.<br>
A hot uniformly pressurizing device 46 is located between the apparatus for<br>
manufacturing compacted irons 60 and the melter-gasifier 20. The hot uniformly<br>
pressurizing device 46 is installed above the melter-gasifier 20 in order to control<br>
pressure. Although the inside of the melter-gasifier 20 is at a high pressure, the<br>
crushed reduced materials can be easily charged into the melter-gasifier 20 since<br>
the hot uniformly pressurizing device 46 uniformly controls the pressure.<br>
In the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 500 according to a fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 5, the fine coals generated<br>
during manufacturing of the coal briquettes can be injected into the melter-gasifier<br>
20. Since the structure of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons 500<br>
according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention is similar to the structure<br>
of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons shown in Fig. 4, the same<br>
elements are referred to with the same reference numerals and the detailed<br>
explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
The apparatus for nanufacturing coal briquettes 30 may include a dust<br>
separator 32 collecting dust generated in the dryer 33. The dust separator 32 is<br>
connected to the fine carbonaceous materials supplying device 10 and supplies fine<br>
coals thereto. The fine coa is are injected with oxygen into the melter-gasifier 20 as<br>
pulverized coals. By using this method, the coals can be recycled. Therefore, not<br>
only is a fuel ratio minim zed but also a losing amount of the coals caused by<br>
elutriation of the dust can be minimized.<br>
A fine carbonaceous naterials supplying device is installed near each tuyere<br>
202 in order to inject fine carbonaceous materials in the first to fifth embodiments<br>
of the above present invent on. The fine carbonaceous materials supplying device<br>
will be explained with reference to Fig. 6 below.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, a mixing chamber 203 is installed ahead of the tuyere.<br>
The fine carbonaceous materials and adding gas are mixed therein and are<br>
supplied to the tuyere. The adding gas supplying line 115 is connected to the<br>
mixing chamber 203 and a suitable amount of an adding gas is supplied. The fine<br>
carbonaceous materials are supplied from the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
supplying device via the fine carbonaceous materials injecting line 113. The fine<br>
carbonaceous materials are njected into the melter-gasifier using the adding gas.<br>
When the fine carbonaceous materials are supplied to the tuyere with<br>
oxygen through a fine carbonaceous materials injecting line 113, the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials are quickly burned. Therefore, when a discharging flow<br>
rate of the fine carbonaceous materials from the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
injecting line 113 is slow, the raceway for burning the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
is formed near the fine carl onaceous materials injecting line 113. Since radiation<br>
heat is discharged from the raceway, a phenomenon that the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials injecting line 113 i; melted and blocked due to the radiation heat occurs.<br>
In order to prevent the above phenomenon, an adding gas is supplied by the<br>
adding gas supplying line 115. By listing this method, the discharging flow rate of<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials from the fine carbonaceous materials injecting line<br>
113 is quickened. Therefore, the raceway is formed away from the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials injecting line 113. In this case, it is preferable that the flow<br>
rate of the fine carbonaceous materials, which are discharged from the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials injecting line 113, is controlled in the range from 40 m/s to<br>
70 m/s. If the flow rate of the fine carbonaceous materials is less than 40 m/s, it is<br>
difficult to inject the fine carbonaceous materials into the melter-gasifier of which<br>
pressure and the varying ange of pressure are much larger than those of the blast<br>
furnace. In addition, if the flow rate of the fine carbonaceous materials is more<br>
than 70 m/s, there is a problem in that the combustion power of the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials is deteriorated.<br>
A combustible gas may be used as the adding gas. The combustible gas<br>
may include hydrocarbor, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide. For example, liquid<br>
natural gas (LNG), cokes oven gas (COG), etc. can be used. In addition, off gas<br>
discharged from the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons according to the<br>
first to fifth embodiment of the present invention, from which CO2 and H2O are<br>
partly removed, can also be used.<br>
When a combustible gas is injected with oxygen through a tuyere, the<br>
combustion reaction of the following Chemical Formula 2 occurs.<br>
[Chemical Formula 2]<br>
(C, H2) in combustible gas + O2 â CO2 + H2O<br>
Here, generated CO2 + H2O are reacted with the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
and carbon elements in the coal packed bed formed near the tuyere. Therefore, an<br>
extra reducing gas generated in the tuyere by supplying combustible gas can be<br>
used. In addition, the heat generated by the predominant combustion of the<br>
reducing gas accelerates the rise of the temperature of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials and then shortens the time for reaching the firing temperature of the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials. Therefore, it is possible to promote combustion of the<br>
fine carbonaceous materials.<br>
In addition, the temperature of the raceway can be lowered by raising the<br>
temperature of the combustible gas and due to a heat for pyrolyzing hydrocarbon<br>
contained therein and the generating amount of the hot gas can be increased.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to uniformly control heat distribution around the tuyere in<br>
a much larger range.<br>
The angle a formed between the adding gas supplying line 115 and the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials supplying line 113 is preferably in the range from 30<br>
degrees to 90 degrees. If ihe angle a is less than 30 degrees, combustion may be<br>
difficult to occur since the flow rate is too quick due to the adding gas. On the<br>
contrary, if the angle a is more than 90 degrees, there is a problem in that the<br>
acceleration of the fine carbonaceous materials is not easy.<br>
The present invention will be explained in more detail by the experimental<br>
examples of the present invention below. The experimental examples of the<br>
present invention are merely to illustrate the present invention, and the present<br>
invention is not limited the eto.<br>
Experimental examples<br>
The experiment is carried out using an apparatus having the same structure<br>
of the apparatus for manufacturing molten irons according to the fourth<br>
embodiment of the prese it invention shown in Fig. 4 in order to observe a<br>
variation of a reduction ratio of a reducing gas as the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
are injected into the melter -gasifier and a variation of combustion temperature in<br>
the melter-gasifier.<br>
Oxygen of 25Â°C and 380 Nm3/(t-p) (namely, oxygen of 380 Nm3 per 1 ton of<br>
molten irons) was injected into the melter-gasifier. The amount of the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials was controlled to be varied by the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials supplying device. The results of a technical analysis and an element<br>
analysis of the fine carbonaceous materials used in the experimental examples of<br>
the present invention are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.<br><br><br>
In Experimental example 1, the reducing amount of CH4 gas was measured<br>
according to the injecting air ount of the fine carbonaceous materials by injecting<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials. In Experimental example 2, the oxidization ratio<br>
of the reducing gas according to an amount of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier was<br>
measured. In Experiments example 3, the reduction ratio of the reduced<br>
materials, which are reduced to the reduced gas according to the variation of the<br>
oxidization ratio of the reducing gas, was measured. Finally, in Experimental<br>
example 4, the variation of combustion temperature in the melter-gasifier<br>
according to the variation of the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials was measured. Experimented example 1 to Experimental example 4 will<br>
be explained in detail below.<br>
Experimental example 1<br>
In order to observe the reducing amount of the CH4 gas according to the<br>
increase of the injecting amount of .the fine carbonaceous materials in the<br>
melter-gasifier, the reducing amount of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier was<br>
measured at each time of increasing the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials by 50 kg/(p-t). The amount of CH4 gas, which was 4.5 voI% in the<br>
melter-gasifier before injecting the fine carbonaceous materials, is gradually<br>
decreased as the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous materials is increased.<br>
The reducing amount of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier according to the increase of<br>
injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous materials is shown in Table 3. Here, the<br>
reducing amount of CH4 gas is the value when the amount of CH4 gas at the time<br>
of measuring is subtracted from 4.5 vol%, which is the original amount of CH4 gas.<br><br>
The data of Table 3 were diagramed in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the injecting<br>
amount of fine carbonaceous materials is shown on the x-axis and the reducing<br>
amount of CH4 gas in the me ter-gasif ier is shown on the y-axis. As shown in Fig.<br>
7, there exists a linear relationship between the injecting amount of fine<br>
carbonaceous materials and the reducing amount of CH4. That is, the amount of<br>
CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier is regularly decreased as the injecting amount of the<br>
fine carbonaceous materials it increased. As shown in Fig. 7, the injecting amount<br>
of fine carbonaceous materials (x) and the reducing amount of CH4 gas in the<br>
melter-gasifier (y) substantially satisfy the following Formula 1. That is, they<br>
satisfy the condition that is the same as the following Formula 1 or is similar to it.<br>
[Formula 1]<br>
y = O.OOOlx<br>
Here, the unit of x is <g the unit of y is and></g>
is %/(kg/t-p).<br>
With reference to Experimental example 1, the amount of CH4 gas in the<br>
melter-gasifier was recognized to be able to be linearly decreased when the fine<br>
carbonaceous materials are injected into the melter-gasifier.<br>
Experimental example 2<br>
In Experimental example 2 of the present invention, an oxidization ratio of<br>
the reducing gas according to the reducing amount of CH4 gas in the<br>
melter-gasifier was measured. The measurement of the oxidization ratio is<br>
carried out by a speclroscope through which line spectrums can be observed. The<br>
method for measuring an oxidization ratio can be easily understood by those<br>
skilled in the art in the technical field of the present invention, and so a detailed<br>
explanation thereof will be omitted.<br>
The oxidization ratio of the reducing gas was measured 67 times according<br>
to the variation of the amour t of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier, and the results are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table. 4 the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas was<br>
recognized to be decreased to be not more than 11.432%. That is, the reducing gas<br>
of which the oxidization ratio becomes in the range of more than 0% and not more<br>
than 11.432% is supplied to the reduction reactors. Therefore, the amount of CH4<br>
gas was decreased as the fine carbonaceous materials are injected, and thereby the<br>
oxidization ratio of the reducing gas was recognized to be reduced to be not more<br>
than 11.432%.<br>
The data of Table 4 are diagramed in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, it can be<br>
observed that the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas is increased as the amount<br>
of the CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier is increased. That is, the reduction power of<br>
the reducing gas is increased. The linear function is calculated by least square<br>
method in order to draw a relationship between the amount of CH4 gas in the<br>
melter-gasifier and the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas. Since the least<br>
square method can be under stood by those skilled in the art in the technical field of<br>
the present invention, a detailed explanation thereof will be omitted. If x denotes<br>
the amount of CH4 gas in th ? melter-gasifier and y denotes an oxidization ratio of<br>
the reducing gas in the me ter-gasifier, it will be recognized that the following<br>
Formula 2 is substantially satisfied. That is, the amount of CH4 gas and the<br>
oxidization ratio of the reducing gas satisfy the condition that is the same as the<br>
following Formula 2 or is similar to it.<br>
[Formula 2]<br>
1.6653x-y = -1.1472<br>
Here, the unit of x is vol%, the unit of y is %, and the unit of 1.6653<br>
is %/vol%.<br>
In addition, the data that are disposed on the straight lines that have the<br>
same slope as that of Formula 2 and are farthest from the straight line of Formula 2<br>
were searched in order to find out the straight lines passing through the data<br>
corresponding to the upper limit and the lower limit among the data of Table 4.<br>
As a result, 2.215vol% of CH4 gas and 2.307% of the oxidization ratio of the<br>
reducing gas shown in NO.2 c f Table 4 correspond to a lower limit, and 4.107vol%<br>
of CH4 gas and 10.311% of the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas shown in NO.<br>
51 of Table 4 correspond to an upper limit.<br>
Therefore, the range of straight lines, which pass through the above upper<br>
limit and lower limit and have the same slope as the straight line of Formula 2, can<br>
be shown as Formula 3. That is, the amount of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier (x)<br>
and the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas (y) substantially satisfy the following<br>
Formula 3. That is, the amount of CH4 gas in the melter-gasifier and the<br>
oxidization ratio of the reducing gas satisfy the condition that is the same as the<br>
following Formula 3 or is similar to it.<br>
[Formula 3]<br>
-3.4718 
Here, the unit of x i; vol%, the unit of y is %, and the unit of 1.3824<br>
is %/vol%.<br>
In accordance with Formula 3, the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas<br>
according to the decrease of the amount of CH4 gas is shown as deviant crease<br>
lines in Fig. 8. As describee above, it can be recognized that oxidization of the<br>
reducing gas is proportionally decreased as the amount of CH4 is decreased with<br>
reference to Experimental example 2 of the present invention. Therefore, it may<br>
be recognized that the oxidisation ratio of the reducing gas can be reduced by<br>
injecting the fine carbonaceous materials.<br>
Experimental example 3<br>
In Experimental example 3, the variation of the reduction ratio of the<br>
reduced materials according to the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas is<br>
diagramed and the trend thereof was observed. That is, the oxidization ratio of<br>
the reducing gas in the meller-gasifier and the reduction ratio of the reduced<br>
materials reduced in the reduction reactors to which reducing gas is supplied were<br>
measured and diagramed. The measurement of the oxidization ratio of the<br>
reducing gas was carried out by the method which is the same as in the<br>
Experimental example 2. The reduction ratio of the reduced materials was<br>
measured by comparing the mixture containing iron ores before passing through<br>
the reduction reactors with the mixture containing iron ores after passing through<br>
the reduction reactors. Since the measurement of the oxidization ratio of the<br>
reducing gas and the reduction ratio of the reduced materials can be easily<br>
understood by those skilled in the art in the technical field of the present invention,<br>
the detailed explanation thereo will be omitted.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an oxidization ratio of the reducing gas in the melter-gasifier as<br>
the x-axis and a reduction ratio of the reduced materials as the y-axis.<br>
The relationship between the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas and the<br>
reduction ratio of the reduced materials shown as dots in.Fig. 9 is straightly lined<br>
using least square method and then the result of the following Formula 4 is<br>
acquired. The oxidization ratio of the reducing gas (x) and the reduction ratio of<br>
the reduced materials (y) substantially satisfy the following Formula 4. That is,<br>
the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas (x) and the reduction ratio of the reduced<br>
materials (y) satisfy the condition that is the same as the following Formula 4 or is<br>
similar to it.<br>
[Formula 4]<br>
y = -2.10x + 103.9<br>
Here, the unit of x is %, the unit cf y is %, and the unit of 103.9 is %.<br>
As can be seen from Formula 4, the reduction ratio of the reduced materials<br>
is decreased when the oxidization ratio of the reducing gas is increased. Therefore,<br>
a consuming time for completely reducing the reduced materials in the<br>
melter-gasifier is reduced and so the production efficiency is improved.<br>
That is, since the fine carbonaceous materials are injected into the center<br>
portion of a melter-gasifier at a hot temperature, the fine carbonaceous materials<br>
are completely burned and the volatile matters contained therein are converted<br>
into CO gas or H2 gas. Therefore, the amount of CH4 gas in the melter gasifier<br>
caused by incomplete combustion is deceased. In addition, since the amount of<br>
CH4 gas is decreased and the amount of CO gas or H2 gas is increased, the amount<br>
of reducing gas generated fron the melter-gasifier and supplied to the reduction<br>
reactors is increased. Therefore, oxidation of the reducing gas is increased. The<br>
reducing gas having improved oxidization ratio is supplied to the reduction<br>
reactors and the reduction ratio of the reduced materials passing through the<br>
reduction reactors is increased. Since the reduced materials, of which the<br>
reduction ratio is increased, a'e supplied to the melter-gasifier, reduced molten<br>
irons can finally be obtained ev en though a small amount of lumped carbonaceous<br>
materials are charged into the melter-gasifier. That is, an amount of lumped<br>
carbonaceous materials charged into the melter-gasifier is considerably reduced as<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials are injected, and thereby a fuel ratio is significantly<br>
reduced.<br>
Experimental example 4<br>
In Experimental example 4, temperature variation of the raceway in the<br>
melter-gasifier was measured according to the injection of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials. Assuming that the combustion is carried out in an adiabatic state and<br>
there is no heat loss outside of the raceway, the combustion temperature of the<br>
raceway was measured while the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials is increased by 50 kg per 1 ton of molten irons. The temperature of the<br>
raceway was measured by using a thermocouple installed in the melter-gasifier,<br>
and the experimental results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
As shown in Table 5, it can be recognized that combustion temperature is<br>
substantially decreased by 200 Â°C as the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials is increased by 50 kg per 1 ton of molten irons. Namely, the combustion<br>
temperature is almost decreased by 200 Â°C.<br>
As can be seen from Experimental example 4 of the present invention, it is<br>
recognized that the combustion temperature in the melter-gasifier can be<br>
significantly reduced as the injecting amount of the fine carbonaceous materials is<br>
increased. Therefore, not only is the furnace heat of the melter-gasifier easily<br>
controlled, but also the Si content in the molten irons, which has a bad influence on<br>
the molten irons, can be reduced. In addition, the process of injecting fine<br>
carbonaceous materials can replace the process of moisturing through the tuyere<br>
for controlling furnace heat.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a variation of fuel ratio and yield according to the injection of<br>
the fine carbonaceous materials. In Fig. 10, variation of fuel ratio and yield is<br>
shown in a state before pulverized coal injection (PCI), in a state of injecting 50~80<br>
kg/(p-t) of fine carbonaceous materials, and in a state of injecting 80~120 kg/(p-t)<br>
of fine carbonaceous materials. Assuming the same amount of molten irons is<br>
produced, it can be recognized that the fuel ratio is significantly reduced by<br>
injecting fine carbonaceous materials. That is, it can be recognized that the fuel<br>
ratio is reduced by 30 kg per 1 ton of molten irons as the fine carbonaceous<br>
materials are injected by 100kg per 1 ton of molten irons.<br>
If the fine carbonaceous materials are injected like above, the amount of<br>
reducing gas in the melter-gasifier is increased since volatile matters contained in<br>
the fine carbonaceous materia Is are completely burned. Since the reducing gas is<br>
increased and is supplied tc the reduction reactors, the reduction ratio of the<br>
reduced materials passing through the reduction reactors can be increased.<br>
Therefore, the amount of lumped carbonaceous materials charged into the<br>
melter-gasifier for final redudion can be reduced. Namely, there is an effect that<br>
the fuel ratio can be reduced.<br>
In addition, since fine carbonaceous materials are injected with oxygen<br>
through the tuyere of the me ter-gasifier, there is an advantage that combustion<br>
temperature in the melter-gasifier can be controlled, the furnace heat can be<br>
delicately controlled and the coal packed bed can be stabilized.<br>
Furthermore, the stagnating time of the charging materials in the<br>
melter-gasifier is increased when the fine carbonaceous materials are injected, and<br>
thereby the temperature of the dome portion is naturally increased. Accordingly,<br>
the flow amount of oxygen of the dust burner installed in the melter-gasifier can be<br>
reduced. Therefore, the reducing gas having an advantage in reduction can be<br>
obtained by reducing re-oxidization of the reducing gas.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
