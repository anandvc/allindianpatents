				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted [2-(l-piperazinyl)ethoxy]-methyl compounds of formula I. Said formula has been disclosed hereunder to manufacture a compound of formula II that is a valuable intermediate for the compound of formula III.<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, substituted [2-(l-piperazinyl)ethoxy] methyl compounds of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and.<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR4 or -R5, where R4 is chosen from the groups -OR6 or -R7, in which<br>
R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
R6 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl/ alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and<br>
R7 represents a haloalkyl radical, to a process for the preparation of these compounds, and to their use for the preparation of compounds of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1 has the same meaning as in formula I and X1 and X2 independently represent a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom.  In the case where R1 represents a -COOH group and where X1 represents a chlorine atom in  position 4 and X2 represents a hydrogen atom, the compound of formula II is 2-[2-(4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy)acetic acid<br>
of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
In the case where R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being tn alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and where X1 represents a chlorine atom in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom, the compounds of formula II are valuable intermediates for the preparation of 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of formula III, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. 2-[2-[4-[(4-Chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid dihydrochloride, a product which is also known under the common international name of cetirizine, is described in Canadian patent 1,199,918 and has been introduced as a medicament for the treatment of allergic syndromes, for instance chronic and acute allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, pruritus, urticaria, etc.  In its therapeutic application, this product proved to be remarkably free of side effects on the central nervous system, such as drowsiness, attenuated mental performance, etc.  (cfr. D.P. TASHKIN et al., Annals of Allergy, Part II, 5_9, (1987) , 49-52, as well as F.M. GENGO et al., Annals of Allergy, Part II, 59,(1987),53-57).<br>
In the case where R1 represents a -COOH group and where X1 and X2 each represent a fluorine atom in position 4, the compound of formula II is 2-[2-{4-[bis (4-f luorophenyl)methyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
F In the case where R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and where X1 and X2 each represent a fluorine atom in position 4, the compounds of formula II are valuable intermediates for the preparation of 2-[2-[4-[bis (4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic  acid of formula IV as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
2-[2-[4-[Bis (4-fluorophenyl)methyl]-l-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid dihydrochloride is also known under the common international name of efletirizine.  The use of efletirizine for the treatment of rhinitis or rhino-conjunctivitis of allergic origin has been suggested in several recent communications (51st Annual Meeting or American Academy of Allergy and Immunology, reproduced in J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 95/1 (1995), part 2, Abstract 229 and XV1-" Congress of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, reproduced in Allergy &amp; Clin. Immunol. News, (1994) suppl. No. 2, abstracts 428, 1136, 1496 and 1864).  These communications indicate that the intranasal administration of efletirizine might provide an effective therapeutic treatment of rhinitis or rhino-conjunctivitis of allergic origin. Canadian patent 1,199,918, in the name of the Applicant, describes the synthesis of 2- [2- [4- [ (4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl] -1-<br>
piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride.  In this synthesis, the starting material is 1-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]piperazine, which may be reacted with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)acetate or 2-(2-chloroethoxy)acetamide to form respectively methyl 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetate (compound of formula II with R1 = -COOCH3, R1= -Cl (position 4) and X2 = -H) or 2-[2-[4-[ (4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl] -1-piperazinyl] ethoxy] acetamide (compound of formula II with R1 = -CONH2, X1 = -Cl (position 4) and X2 = -H) .  This methyl<br>
ester as well as this acetamide may then be subjected to hydrolysis with an inorganic base (potassium or sodium hydroxide) to form the sodium or potassium salt, which is readily converted into cetirizine and its dihydrochloride. Canadian Patent 1,320,732, also in the name of the Applicant, gives an alternative synthetic route for the preparation of 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride.<br>
According to that patent, 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride are prepared by a process which is characterized in that 2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethanol is reacted with an alkali metal haloacetate, in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide, and in that the alkali metal salt thus obtained is converted into the corresponding acid and, where appropriate, into its dihydrochloride.<br>
Canadian patent 1,317,300, also in the name of the Applicant provides another synthetic process which makes it possible to prepare 2-[2-[4-[ (4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride.<br>
According to that patent, 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and its dihydrochloride are prepared by a process which is characterized in that 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetonitrile (compound of formula II with R1 = -CN, R1 = -C1 (position 4) and X2 = -H) is hydrolysed in aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic medium and with a base or with an acid, and in that the acid thus obtained is converted, where appropriate, into its dihydrochloride.<br>
The 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetonitrile used as starting material is obtained by reacting l-[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]piperazine with a 2-haloethoxyacetonitrile. This reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an alkali metal carbonate, and optionally in the presence of a small amount of alkali metal iodide to accelerate the reaction, in an inert organic solvent such as an alcohol (for example n-butanol, etc.), preferably at a temperature in the region of the reflux temperature.<br>
Given the increasing therapeutic value of cetirizine and of compounds of similar structure, the Applicant set itself the objective and undertook research studies with the aim of developing a new synthetic route to 2-[2-[4-<br>
[(4-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which would make it possible to obtain this compound from known and/or readily accessible reagents and which would moreover provide this compound in a sufficient purity and an economically acceptable yield.  Moreover, for the purpose of simplifying the industrialization of the process, the Applicant set itself the further objective of developing a synthetic route which might have fewer steps than the known processes.<br>
In addition, given the therapeutic value of other compounds of formula II, such as efletirizine for example, it would be advantageous for these other compounds to be able to be prepared according to essentially similar processes.<br>
Consequently, it is necessary to find precursors which, on the one hand, may themselves be prepared readily and economically, and, on the other hand, may be converted readily and in high yields into compounds of formula II. The Applicant has just discovered a family of compounds, namely substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds which satisfy this objective entirely.<br>
The subject of the present invention is thus, as novel compounds, substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR4 or -R5, where R4 is chosen from the groups -OR6 or -R7, in which<br>
R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
R6 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and<br>
R7 represents a haloalkyl radical. These compounds may readily be obtained by reaction of a piperazine of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR4 or<br>
-R5, where R4 is chosen from the groups -OR5 or -R7, in which R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical, R6 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and R7 represents a haloalkyl, with a substituted (2-haloethoxy]methyl of formula<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1 represents a -CONH2- -CN -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and X represents a halogen atom.  Usually, a compound of formula VI is used in which X represents a chlorine or iodine atom, but this reaction may also be carried out with the corresponding bromide.  It has been observed that when X represents an iodine atom, it is advantageous to work at fairly low temperatures (below 40°C) and for relatively short times (2 hours for example).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of substituted [2-(l-piperazinyl)ethoxyl-methyl compounds of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR, group, M being an<br>
alkali metal and R, being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
R2represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR, or -R5, where R4 is chosen from<br>
the groups -OR,, or -R,, in which<br>
R3 represents an ally! or alkylaryl radical<br>
R6 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from   1  to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and<br>
R7 represents a haloalkyl radical, comprising reacting<br>
a piperazine of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R2 is as defined above, with a substituted [2-haloethoxy]methyl of formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R, is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom.<br>
This reaction is generally carried out by heating to between 30 and 180°C, for several hours, in a solvent chosen from aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic ketones (for example methyl ethyl ketone), aromatic hydrocarbons (for example toluene or xylene) or alternatively in water and, in the presence of an acid acceptor such as a tertiary organic base (for example triethylamine) or an inorganic base (for example sodium carbonate). When a large excess of piperazine (more than three equivalents relative to the [2-haloethoxylmethyl) is used, the piperazine itself acts as acid acceptor and it is not essential to add an additional acid acceptor. Advantageously, a piperazine and its dihydrochloride may also be used in equivalent amounts.<br>
In general, in order to prepare the substituted (2-(l-piperazinyl)-ethoxy]methyl compounds of the invention, it is preferred, for obvious reasons of simplicity, to use the piperazine of formula V in which R2 represents a hydrogen atom. It may nevertheless prove wise to protect one of the amine functions of the piperazine during this reaction with a conventional protecting group for this function in order to prevent the piperazine from reacting twice with the compound of formula VI.<br>
As protecting group for the amine function, any protecting group known to those skilled in the art for this purpose may be used.<br>
To this end, it is possible to choose a protecting group which, after formation of the compound of formula I, may be selectively cleaved off according to the equation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Protecting groups which are paz-ticularly suitable in this case are for example haloalkyl, alkylhaloaryl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl, and alkylhaloaryl carbamates, amides such as trifluoroacetamide or alternatively tertiary amines, such as N-allylamines or N-alkylarylamines.<br>
With these groups, the reaction for the deprotection of the amine function of the piperazine may be carried out by a simple heating, by catalytic hydrogenation or by hydrolysis by means of a base or an acid, according to techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
According to one variant, as protecting group for the amine function, a group may also be chosen which may be cleaved off under conditions such that, in the case where R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, simultaneously with the reaction for deprotection of the amine function, the group R1  is converted into a -COOH group, and, in the case where R1 represents a -COOH group, this -COOH group is conserved during the reaction for deprotection of the amine function. This reaction is carried out according to the equation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Protecting groups which are particularly suitable in this case are for<br>
example alkyl carbamate groups.<br>
With such carboxylated groups, the amine function of the piperazine may be<br>
deprotected by heating for several hours in alcoholic or aqueous medium in<br>
the presence of an inorganic base or by any other conventional method known<br>
to those skilled in the art.<br>
In the two preceding equations,<br>
R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a group -COR4 or -R5, where R4 is chosen from the groups -ORg or -R7, in which<br>
R5 represents an allyl or alkylaryl radical,<br>
R6 represents a linear or branched alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a haloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylnitroaryl or alkylhaloaryl radical, and<br>
R7 represents a haloalkyl radical. The substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl compounds of formula I thus prepared find their main value as precursors for the preparation of compounds of formula II (or compounds of formulae III and IV in the case where R1 represents a -COOH group) which may thus be prepared in sufficient purity, in an economically acceptable yield, in fewer steps and starting from the same precursors, which represents an appreciable advantage as regards simplifying the industrial process and reducing the production costs. Consequently, the present invention also relates to the preparation of compounds of formula II (or compounds of formulae III and IV in the case where R1 represents a -COOH group) by reaction of a compound of formula I in which R2 represents a hydrogen atom with a diphenylmethyl halide of formula VII according to the equation:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which<br>
R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOH, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
X' represents a halogen atom chosen from chlorine, bromine and iodine, X1 and  X2   independently represent a hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom.<br>
This reaction is carried out by reacting the diphenylmethyl halide of formula VI with the compound of formula I in molar proportions of between 4:1 and 1:4 for a period of between a few minutes and several hours at a temperature between about 60 and about 160°C, in an inert solvent chosen from aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic ketones (for example methyl ethyl ketone), aromatic hydrocarbons (for example toluene or xylene), aliphatic nitriles (for example acetonitrile).  It is optionally possible to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid acceptor such as a tertiary organic base (for example triethylamine) or an inorganic base (for example sodium carbonate).  This<br><br>
reaction may optionally be carried out in the presence of an alkali metal iodide.<br>
As indicated above, the compounds of formula II (in which R1 represents a -CONH2, -CN, -COOM or -COOR3 group, M being an alkali metal and R3 being an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X1 represents a chlorine atom in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom) are already known and their conversion into 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxyjacetic acid of formula III has already been described in aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic medium, and with a base or with an acid.  Moreover, the compound of formula II in which R1 represents a -COOH group and X1 represents a chlorine atom in position 4 and X2 a hydrogen atom, is 2-[2-[4-[(4-<br>
chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxyjacetic acid of formula III. Thus, for the subsequent conversion of the alkyl 2-[2-[4-[(4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetate (compound of formula II with R1 = -COOR3, X1   =   -Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H) or 2-[2-[4-[ (4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl]-1-piperazinyl]ethoxy]acetamide (compound of formula II with R1 = -CONH2, X1 = -Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H) into 2-[2- [4- [ (4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl] -1-piperazinyl] ethoxy] acetic acid of formula III, reference is made to Canadian patent 1,199,918 and for conversion of the 2- [2- [4- [ (4-chlorophenyDphenylmethyl ] -1-<br>
piperazinyl] ethoxy] acetonitrile (compound of formula II with R1 = -CN, X]_ = -Cl in position 4 and X2 = -H), reference is made to Canadian patent 1,317,300.<br>
For the conversion of the other compounds of formula II, the process is performed analogously.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention without however limiting it.  In these examples, the melting points were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (D.S.C.) with a temperature gradient of 20°C/min.  The mass spectra were recorded with a Finnigan MAT TSQ 700 machine.  The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker machine at 250 MHz in dimethyl sulphoxide using tetramethylsilane as internal standard. The chemical shifts are indicated in 8 (ppm).  The letters s, d, dd, t, q, b and m respectively indicate a singlet, a doublet, a doubled doublet, a triplet, a quartet, a broad peak and a multiplet.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example I.  Preparation of substituted [2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]methyl<br>
compounds of formula I. 1.1.       Preparation of the compounds of formula I with R9 = -H. - I 1 1.      2-[2-(1-Piperazinyl)ethoxy]acetamide.<br>
1.1.1.1.<br>
A mixture of 13.15 g of (2-chloroethoxy)acetamide (0.1 mol) and 43 g of anhydrous piperazine (0.5 mol) in 250 ml of toluene is introduced into a round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled condenser and a mechanical stirrer.  The mixture is heated at the reflux temperature for 4 hours. The precipitate formed is filtered off while hot and the solvent of the filtrate is evaporated off under reduced pressure to dryness.  The evaporation residue is purified by chromatography on silica gel (eluent: 14/5/1 (v/v/v) of dichloromethane/methanol/28% aqueous ammonia solution). 7.4 g of 2-[2-(1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]acetamide are obtained in the form of a yellow oil. Yield: 39%. Mass spectrum: 188 (MH+), 99 (HN(C4H8)N+=CH2), 44 (CONH2)<br>

8.6 g (0.1 mol) of piperazine, 15.9 g (0.1 mol) of piperazine<br>
dihydrochloride, 10.8 ml (0.6 mol) of water and 86 ml of methyl ethyl ketone are introduced into a 250 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled condenser and a mechanical stirrer.<br>
The mixture is brought to a temperature of 65°C.  13.8 g (0.1 mol) of (2-chloroethoxy)acetamide are then added in a single portion.  The mixture is maintained at the temperature of 65°C for 16 hours.  The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the two ph'ases are then left to separate out by settling before separating them.  The lower phase (oily phase immiscible with the methyl ethyl ketone) is rinsed with 2 x 25 ml of methyl ethyl ketone. This oil is taken up in 50 ml of ethanol and is left stirring for 15 minutes. The precipitate formed (piperazine dihydrochloride) is filtered off and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at 50°C on a rotary evaporator.  27 g of a yellow oil are obtained which product is purified by preparative chromatography on silica gel (eluent: 82/15/1/2 (v/v/v/v) mixture of dichloromethane/methanol/28% (weight) aqueous ammonia solution/water). 10.7 g of [2- (1-piperazinyl) ethoxy]acetamide are finally obtained in the form of a colorless oil which crystallizes.<br><br>
