COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION 10, rule 13)<br>
" A process for the coloring of fiber or yarn or fabric with lH-indol-3yl-<br>
β-D glucopyranoside"<br>
Dr. Henriques Bosco Maria Agnelo, an Indian national, of 1-21, Stone Castle, Mandapeshwar, Borivali (W), Mumbai 400 103, India and Mrs.   Ann   Shankar,   a   British   national,   of  1-21,   Stone   Castle, Mandapeshwar, Borivali (W), Mumbai 400 103, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature<br>
of this invention:                                                             GRANTED	<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1029/MUM/2000                               15 SEP 2004<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the coloring of fiber or yarn or fabric with 1H-indol-3yl- β-D glucopyranoside.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
The most primitive indigo dyeing process involved dipping the article to be dyed into fresh leaf extract containing 1H-indol-3yl- β-D glucopyranoside and then oxidizing the article by airing it.<br>
This process required fresh leaves, which were not always available, and was difficult to control. Hence the leaves were fermented and the ferment then oxidized to produce indigo which could be stored, easily transported and then applied using another fermentation process to reduce and solubilize the dye. This was the basis of the ancient indigo dyeing industry.<br>
Later chemical reductants replaced the fermentative processes to reduce and apply the dye. The fermentative process of reduction though eco-friendly is slow, needs complex sources of sugar/ starch and is not easily amenable to mass production methods. The chemical reduction process is fast, can be properly controlled, and applied on a mass scale in dyeing factories. It is, however, highly polluting.<br>
In the oldest process for coloring fiber with indigo, fresh leaves and water are put in the pot with alkalizing ingredients such as ash water or urine, which will set off fermentation and gradually reduce the oxygen. The yarn is dipped directly in this pot and oxidized by airing it. The method can be used only near the cultivated plants, the colour is weak and the yarn has to be dipped repeatedly.<br>
In later processes, indigo cake was used in place of leaves. In order to return the indigo to the soluble, leucoindigo state ready for application to the substrate, it is finely ground and again subjected to a fermentation vat. The process is accomplished by the addition of fruits such as dates, papaya, bor etc., or sugars such as palm sugar, molasses, or jaggery, or starch from wheat bran, cooked glutinous rice, ragi or tapioca. To neutralize the excess acid caused by fermentation, alkaline substances such as natural soda, river mud, wood ash, stale urine or animal droppings are added. The most effective for dissolving indigo pigment is calcinated or slaked lime. The<br><br>
anaerobic conditions and the reducing nature of the ferment reduce the indigo to leuco-indigo. The substrate is dipped into the solution of leuco-indigo and aired to oxidize the leuco form back to insoluble indigo dye. The substrate is then dipped and aired to oxidize the indoxyl back into insoluble blue indigo dye.<br>
Synthetic and inorganic methods of dyeing with indigo were also developed such as:<br>
Orpiment Vat: introduced to European dyers from India in the 16th century. In this vat, arsenic sulphide was used as the reducing agent, but its highly corrosive nature made it difficult to handle.<br>
Copperas Vat: introduced in the mid-18th century, this, the first cold inorganic vat, combined ferrous sulphate with slaked lime or potash. The process was simple and gave good colour, but was expensive and produced a large amount of sediment (gypsum and ferrous hydroxide).<br>
Zinc-Lime Vat: introduced by Leuchs in 1845, it was cheaper and easier to use than the copperas vat. Slaked lime and zinc dust interacted to form hydrogen, which acted as a reducing agent. Again, it produced too much sediment, and the lime had to be removed by dipping the substrate in acid.<br>
Sodium Hydrosulphite-Caustic Soda Vat: this synthetic vat was introduced in 1900 by Bernthsen and Bazlen, with the development of the reducing agent dithionite, a stable form of sodium hydrosulphite. It is combined with caustic soda. It remains the most popular form of indigo vat; it is relatively simple to use, requires very little dye, leaves little or no sediment, dyes most fibres and is equally effective for both natural and synthetic indigo. The basic ingredients are, however and highly polluting.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to overcome the above disadvantages.<br>
To achieve the said object, the present invention provides for process for a process for the coloring of fiber or yarn or fabric with lH-indol-3yl- β-D glucopyranoside comprising:<br><br>
(i) wetting the yarn/fabric with a solution (weakly alkaline) of lH-indol-3yl- β-D glucopyranoside,<br>
(ii) draining and collecting the excess of lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside for reuse,<br>
(hi)    drying the yarn/fabric.<br>
(iv) if desired repeating the above steps for obtaining deeper shades of blue or dipping the yam/fabric in a solution of isatin to obtain red or purple colors,<br>
(v) subjecting the wet or dry yarn/fabric to hydrolysis for allowing 1H-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside to form indoxyl and glucose.<br>
(vi) exposing the said wet yarn/fabric to a stream of oxygen-rich moist air to oxidise the products of hydrolysis which then precipitates within the fiber,<br>
(vii) washing yarn/ fabric free of residual lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside and glucose.<br>
The concentration of lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside used will depend on the depth of colour required.<br>
The concentration of the isatin used will depend on the shade and depth of colour required.<br>
Hydrolysis in step (v) is acid hydrolysis or enzymatic hydrolysis or hydrolysis due to microbial action.<br>
Said acid hydrolysis is carried out by treating it with dilute acid having a pH of less than 3.<br>
Enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out with enzyme (indimulsin or indimulsin like enzyme) dissolved in an appropriate buffer having a pH at the optima of the enzyme.<br>
Said enzyme acts on the lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside and hydrolyses it to indoxyl and glucose. Enzymes that oxidize glucose may also be added along with indimulsin or indimulsin like enzymes to consume the glucose and thereby assist in the oxidation of the indoxyl to indigo.<br><br>
Hydrolysis by microbial action is done using microbes capable of splitting 1H-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside, which are preferably aerobic or facultatively anaerobic or aero-tolerant anaerobic motile bacteria.<br>
Said microbes are suspended in a medium containing buffer and an assimilative nitrogen source that prevents them from consuming the indoxyl.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The microbes should preferably produce an extracellular and diffusable indimuslin like enzyme. The enzyme acts on the lH-indo)-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside and hydrolyses it to indoxyl and glucose. Motile microbes may move towards the lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside by chemotaxis thereby ensunng maximum conversion of the lH-vndol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside to indoxyl. The enzymatic or microbial treatment may be in the form of a spray or by immersing the 1 H-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside -containing yarn in a solution containing the above mentioned agents.<br>
If only indigo blue has to be formed the pH of the solution or spray should be between 5-8 so as to prevent the formation of indigo-red. Two indoxyl (generated either by hydrolysis or of lH-indol-3yl-β-D glucopyranoside) combine with each other. In the presence of air, they precipitate in the fibre as indigo blue.<br>
Glucose formed in step (viii) can be recovered and used for a variety of purposes.<br>
The above described discussion of this invention is also directed primarily to preferred embodiments and practices thereof. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that further changes and modifications in the actual implementation of the concepts described herein can readily be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.<br><br><br>
