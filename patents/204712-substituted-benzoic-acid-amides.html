THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>

THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"SUBSTITUTED BENZOIC ACID AMIDES"<br>
SCHERING    AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,     a    German     company MuUerstrasse 178, 13342 Berlin, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed: <br>
SUBSTITUTED BENZOIC ACID AMIDES AND THEIR USE FOR<br>
	INHIBITING ANGIOGENESIS<br>
The invention relates to substituted benzoic acid amides and their use as pharmaceutical agents for treating diseases that are triggered by persistent angiogenesis as well as their intermediate products for the production of benzoic acid amides.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis can be the cause of various diseases, such as psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases and arteriosclerosis or can result in an aggravation of these diseases.<br>
Direct or indirect inhibition of the VEGF receptor (VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor) can be used for treating such diseases and other VEGF-induced pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeable conditions, such as tumor vascularization. For example, it is known that the growth of tumors can be inhibited by soluble receptors and antibodies against VEGF.<br>
Persistent angiogenesis is induced by the factor VEGF via its receptor. So that VEGF can exert this action, it is necessary that VEGF bind to the receptor, and a tyrosine phosphorylation is induced.<br><br>
Only derivatives of the compounds claimed here that have been removed were described as calpain inhibitors (WO 9823581, WO 9825883), phospholipase A2<br>
inhibitors (WO 9700583), prostaglandin D2 antagonists (WO 9700853), neurokinin A antagonists (WO 95 16682), tranquilizers (US 3892752) or anorexigenics (FR 1600541).<br>
An action of these known compounds in connection with VEGF was not previously described.<br>

The compounds according to the invention prevent a phosphorylation, i.e., certain tyrosine kinases can be selectively inhibited, whereby the persistent angiogenesis can be stopped. Thus, for example, the growth and the propagation of tumors is prevented.<br>
The compounds of general formula I according to the invention also contain the possible tautomeric forms and comprise the E- or Z-isomers or, if a chiral center is present, also the racemates and enantiomers.<br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their physiologically compatible salts can be used as pharmaceutical agents based on their inhibitory activity relative to the<br><br><br><br>
phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor. Based on their profile of action, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for treating diseases that are caused by persistent angiogenesis.<br>
Since the compounds of formula I are identified as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase KDR and FLT, they are suitable in particular for treating those diseases that are caused by persistent angiogenesis that is triggered via the VEGF receptor or by an increase in vascular permeability.<br>
The subject of this invention is also the use of the compounds according to the invention as inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase KDR and FLT.<br>
Subjects of this invention are thus also pharmaceutical agents for treating tumors or use thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used either alone or in a formulation as pharmaceutical agents for treating psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis and injuries to nerve tissue.<br>
In treating injuries to nerve tissue, quick scar formation on the injury sites can be prevented with the compounds according to the invention, i.e., scar formation is prevented from occurring before the axons reconnect. A reconstruction of the nerve compounds was thus facilitated.<br>
The formation of ascites in patients can also be suppressed with the compounds according to the invention. VEGF-induced edemas can also be suppressed.<br><br><br>
Such pharmaceutical agents, their formulations and uses, are also subjects of this invention.<br>
The invention thus also relates to the use of compounds of general formula I for the production of a pharmaceutical agent for treating tumors, psoriasis; arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemangioma, angiofibroma; eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma; renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombic microangiopathic syndrome, transplant rejections and glomerulopathy; fibrotic diseases, such as cirrhosis of the liver, mesangial cell proliferative diseases, arteriosclerosis, and injuries to nerve tissue.<br>
To use the compounds of formula I as pharmaceutical agents, the latter are brought into the form of a pharmaceutical preparation, which in addition to the active ingredient for enteral or parenteral administration contains suitable pharmaceutical, organic or inorganic inert carrier materials, such as, for example, water, gelatin, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be present in solid form, for example as tablets, coated tablets, suppositories, capsules or in liquid form, for example as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. They optionally contain, moreover, adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, salts for changing osmotic pressure or buffers.<br>
For parenteral administration, especially injection solutions or suspensions, especially aqueous solutions of the active compounds in polyhydroxyethoxylated castor oil, are suitable.<br>
As carrier systems, surface-active adjuvants such as salts of bile acids or animal or plant phospholipids, but also mixtures thereof as well as liposomes or components thereof can also be used.<br><br><br>
For oral administration, especially tablets, coated tablets or capsules with talc and/or hydrocarbon vehicles or binders, such as for example, lactose, corn starch or potato starch, are suitable. The administration can also be carried out in liquid form, such as, for example, as juice, to which optionally a sweetener is added.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredients can vary depending on the method of administration, age and weight of the patient, type and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. The daily dose is 0.5-1000 mg, preferably 50-200 mg, whereby the dose can be given as a single dose to be administered once or divided into 2 or more daily doses.<br>
The above-described formulations and forms for dispensing are also subjects of this invention.<br>
The production of the compounds according to the invention is carried out according to methods that are known in the art. For example, compounds of formula I are obtained, in that a) in a compound of general formula II<br><br>
II in which R4 to R6 have the above-mentioned meaning and A is halogen or OR  , whereby R11 means hydrogen, C1-4-aIkyl or C1-4-acyl, and R2 and R3 mean hydrogen, aldehyde, halogen or OH, O-triflate, O-tosylate or O-mesylate, first R 2  or R 3  is converted into an alkenyl or alkinyl, optionally saturated in the corresponding alkane, and then COA is converted into an amide,<br><br><br><br>
or<br>
b) a compound of general formula III<br><br>
in which R to R have the above-mentioned meaning and T means a protective group, is acylated and then optionally the keto group is reduced to alcohol or alkane, the protective group is cleaved off, the amine is converted into a nitrile, and the nitrile is saponified and converted into an amide.<br>
The sequence of steps can be interchanged in all cases.<br>
The amide formation is carried out according to methods that are known in the literature.<br>
For amide formation, it is possible to start from a corresponding ester. The ester is reacted according to J. Org. Chem. 1995, 8414 with aluminum trimethyl and the corresponding amine in solvents such as toluene at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent. If the molecule contains two ester groups, both are converted into the same amide.<br>
When nitriles are used instead of ester, amidines are obtained under analogous conditions.<br>
For amide formation, however, all processes that are known from peptide chemistry are also available. For example, the corresponding acid can be reacted with the amine in aprotic polar solvents, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, via an activated acid derivative that can be obtained with, for example, hydroxybenzotriazole<br><br><br>
and a carbodiimide, such as, for example, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or else with preformed reagents, such as, for example, HATU (Chem. Comm. 1994, 201) or BTU, at temperatures of between 0°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 80°C. For the amide formation, the process can also be used with the mixed acid anhydride, imidazolide or azide.<br>
Salicylamides are obtained if the corresponding phenol is reacted in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, such as boron trichloride, with isocyanates or isothiocyanates in solvents, such as, for example, toluene, at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
If various amide groups are to be introduced into the molecule, for example, the second ester group must be introduced into the molecule after the production of the first amide group and then amidated, or there is a molecule in which one group is present as an ester, the other is present as an acid, and the two groups are amidated in succession according to various methods.<br>
Thioamides can be obtained from the anthranilamides by reaction with diphosphadithianes according to Bull Soc. Chim. Belg. 87, 229, 1978 or by reaction with phosphorus pentasulfide in solvents such as pyridine or even quite without solvent at temperatures of 0°C to 200°C.<br>
The products can also be subjected to an electrophilic aromatic substitution. The substitution then takes place on compounds of formula III in the ortho- or para-position into the or one of the amino group(s, into compounds of formula II in the meta-position) to form the carbonyl group. Thus, acylation can be done by Friedel-Crafts acylation with acid chlorides in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalysts, such as, for example, aluminum trichloride in solvents such as nitromethane, carbon disulfide, methylene chloride or nitrobenzene at temperatures of between 0°C and the boiling point of the<br><br><br>
solvent, preferably at room temperature. According to processes that are known in the literature, one or more nitro groups can be introduced without solvent, for example by nitrating acid, nitric acid of various concentrations, or by metal nitrates, such as, for example, copper(II) nitrate or iron(III) nitrate in polar solvents such as ethanol or glacial acetic acid or else in acetic anhydride.<br>
The introduction of halogens is carried out according to processes that are known in the literature, e.g., by reaction with bromine, N-bromo- or N-iodosuccinimide or utropin hydrotribromide in polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, glacial acetic acid or dimethylformamide.<br>
The reduction of the nitro group is performed in polar solvents at room temperature or elevated temperature. As catalysts for the reduction, metals such as Raney nickel or noble-metal catalysts such as palladium or platinum or else palladium hydroxide optionally on vehicles are suitable. Instead of hydrogen, for example, ammonium formate, cyclohexene or hydrazine can also be used in a known way. Reducing agents such as tin(II) chloride or titanium(III) chloride can also be used, such as complex metal hydrides, optionally in the presence of heavy metal salts. Iron can also be used as a reducing agent. The reaction is then performed in the presence of an acid, such as, e.g., acetic acid or ammonium chloride, optionally with the addition of a solvent, such as, for example, water, methanol, iron/ammonia, etc. With an extended reaction time, an acylation of the amino group can occur in this variant.<br>
If an alkylation of an amino group is desired, alkylation can be done according to commonly used methods - for example with alkyl halides - or according to the Mitsonubo variant by reaction with an alcohol in the presence of, for example, triphenylphosphine and azodicarboxylic acid ester. The amine can also be subjected to reductive alkylation with aldehydes or ketones, whereby the reaction is performed in the<br><br><br>
presence of a reducing agent, such as, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride in a suitable inert solvent, such as, for example, ethanol, at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent. If a start is made from a primary amino group, the reaction can be performed optionally in succession with two different carbonyl compounds, whereby mixed derivatives are obtained [Literature, e.g., Verardo et al. Synthesis (1993), 121; Synthesis (1991), 447; Kawaguchi, Synthesis (1985), 701; Micovic et al. Synthesis (1991), 1043]. It can be advantageous first to form the Schiff base by reaction of the aldehyde with the amine in solvents such as ethanol or methanol, optionally with the addition of adjuvants such as glacial acetic acid, and then to add only reducing agents, such as, e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
The hydrogenation of alkene or alkine groups in the molecule is carried out in the usual way by, for example, catalytically activated hydrogen. As catalysts, heavy metals such as palladium or platinum, optionally on a vehicle, or Raney nickel can be used. The procedure is performed at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent and at pressures of up to 20 bar, but preferably at room temperature and normal pressure. By the use of catalysts, such as, for example, a Lindlar catalyst, triple bonds can be partially hydrogenated to double bonds, whereby preferably the Z-form is produced. This hydrogenation is preferably performed in pyridine as a solvent with palladium on calcium carbonate as a catalyst. In the same way, the Z-double bond can be produced from the triple bond by reduction with diimine, produced, for example, according to R. M. Moriatry et al. Synth. Comm. 17, 703, 1987.<br>
The acylation of an amino group is carried out in the usual way, with, for example, acid halide or acid anhydride optionally in the presence of a base such as dimethylaminopyridine in solvents such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or<br><br><br>
pyridine, according to the Schotten-Baumann variant in aqueous solution at weakly alkaline pH or by reaction with an anhydride in glacial acetic acid.<br>
A reduction of a keto group is carried out according to processes that are known in the art. Thus, by complex metal hydrides, such as, for example, sodium borohydride in solvents such as methanol or isopropanol, the keto group, in addition to the amide group or ester group, can be reduced selectively to alcohol. A reduction of a keto group to the methylene group can be carried out according to Clemmensen with zinc in hydrochloric acid or else, for example, with silanes in trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
The introduction of the halogens chlorine, bromine, iodine or the azido group via an amino group can be carried out, for example, also according to Sandmeyer by the diazonium salts that are intermediately formed with nitrites being reacted with copper(I) chloride or copper(I) bromide in the presence of the corresponding acid, such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid or with potassium iodide.<br>
If an organic nitrite is used, the halogens can be introduced into a solvent, such as, for example, dimethylformamide, e.g., by adding methylene iodide or tetrabromomethane. The removal of the amino group can be achieved either by reaction with an organic nitrite in tetrahydrofuran or by diazotization and reductive boiling-down of the diazonium salt with, for example, phosphorous acid, optionally with the addition of copper(I) oxide.<br>
The introduction of fluorine can be accomplished, for example, by Balz-Schiemann reaction of the diazonium tetrafluoroborate or according to J. Fluor, Chem. 76, 1996. 59-62 by diazotization in the presence of HFxpyridine and subsequent boiling-down optionally in the presence of a fluoride ion source, such as, e.g., tetrabutylammonium fluoride.<br>
The introduction of the azido group is accomplished after diazotization by reaction with sodium azide at room temperature.<br>
Ether cleavages are performed according to processes that are common in literature. In this case, a selective cleavage can also be achieved in several groups that are present in the molecule. In this case, the ether is treated, for example, with boron tribromide in solvents such as dichloromethane at temperatures of between -100°C up to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at -78°C. It is also possible, however, to cleave the ether by sodium thiomethylate in solvents such as dimethylformamide. The temperature can be between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at 150°C.<br>
The introduction of the alkenyl group is carried out with the corresponding vinyl compounds under the conditions of the Heck reaction. For the introduction of the ethinyl groups, the Songashira reaction is used.<br>
As a leaving group R2, halogens such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine or 0-mesylate, O-tosylate, O-triflate or O-nonaflate are suitable. The nucleophilic substitution for introducing ethinyl or ethenyl radicals is performed under the catalysis of transition metal complexes such as Pd(0), e.g., palladium tetrakis triphenylphosphine or Pd(2+), such as palladium-bis-tri-o-tolylphosphine-dichloride, nickel (II) or nickel (0) according to methods that are known in the literature, optionally in the presence of a base and optionally under co-catalysis of a salt, such as, for example, copper(I) iodide or lithium chloride.<br>
As nucleophiles, for example, vinyl or ethinyl compounds, tin-organic compounds or zinc-organic compounds are suitable. The reaction can be performed in polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetonitrile, in hydrocarbons such as toluene or in ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane or diethyl ether. As bases, inorganic bases such as alkali or alkaline-earth hydroxides or<br><br><br>
bicarbonates, carbonates, phosphates or organic bases such as cyclic, alicyclic and aromatic amines, such as pyridine, triethylamine, DBU and Hiinig base, are suitable, whereby in many cases, bases such as diethylamine or piperidine can also simultaneously be solvents. The application of pressure can be beneficial to the reaction.<br>
If a trimethylsilylethinyl group is introduced, the trimethylsilyl group can by reaction with fluorides, such as, for example, potassium fluoride or tetrabutylammonium fluoride in solvents such astetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, or acetonitrile at temperatures of 0°C up to the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
An alkenyl group cati also be introduced, however, by olefmation reactions, such as, e.g., the Peterson olefmation, the Wittig reaction or the Wittig-Horner reaction. To this end, the aldehyde is reacted with the anion that was already produced, e.g., a correspondingly substituted phosphonium salt or phosphonic acid ester in solvents such as toluene, tetrahydrofuran,diethyl ether or dimethoxyethane. As bases, e.g., alkali hydrides, alkali amides, alkali alcoholates, such as, for example, potassium tert-butylate, alkali and alkaline-earth carbonates or hydroxides optionally are suitable in the presence of phase-transfer catalysts, such as, e.g., crown ethers or else organic bases such as triethylamine diisopropylethylamine or diazabicycloundecane, optionally in the presence of salts such as lithium bromide.<br>
The isomer mixtures can be separated into enantiomers or E/Z isomers according to commonly used methods, such as, for example, crystallization, chromatography or salt formation.<br>
The production of the salts is carried out in the usual way by a solution of the compound of formula I being mixed with the equivalent amount or an excess of a base or acid, which optionally is in Solution, and the precipitate being separated or the solution being worked up in the usual way.<br><br><br>
If the production of the intermediate compounds is not described, the latter are known or can be produced analogously to known compounds or processes that are described here.<br>
The intermediate compounds that are described are especially suitable for the production of benzoic acid amides according to the invention.<br>
