HIGH IMPEDANCE FAULT DETECTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to fault detection in electrical power systems, and particularly, to high impedance fault detection in electrical power distribution lines.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
High impedance faults are characterized by a high impedance at the point of fault. Accordingly, a high impedance fault typically produces a small fault current level. High impedance faults can, therefore, be generally"<br>
defined as those faults that do not draw Sufficient fault<br>
t current to be recognized and cleared by conventional<br>
overcurrent devices, such as protective relays.<br>
High impedance faults result when an energized primary conductor comes in contact ,with a quasi-insulating object, such as a tree, la structure or equipment, a pole crossarm, or falls to the ground. Typically, a high impedance fault exhibits arcing and flashing at the point of contact. The significance of these hard to detect faults is that they represent a serious public safety hazard as well as a risk of arcing ignition of fires. As such, high 'impedance fault detection has been a major concern of protective relaying for a long time.<br>
Protective relays are usually designed to protect equipment (line, transformer, etc.) from damage by isolating the equipment during high current conditions. High impedance faults, are typically found on distribution circuits, results in very little, if any, current. High impedance faults do not pose a threat to equipment and by their nature they can ' not be detected with conventional overcurrent devices. Nonetheless, the dangers of a downed conductor are obvious to all. Possibility of fire, property damage, and someone coming<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
2<br>
into contact with the • live conductor are some of the major concerns.<br>
Also, legal issues in promising a comprehensive solution may be very costly for manufacturers (e.g., liability issues). For example, tripping the breaker following high impedance fault detection is not a clear cut choice. While the high impedance fault is a danger, tripping the feeder unnecessarily will create new hazards by de-energizing homes, traffic signals, offices, etc. The effects of incorrectly determining a high impedance fault will have economic and legal ramifications .• • ~<br>
The utility must always have the safety of the public as a top priority. However, high impedance fault 'detection has not been possible in the past and realistic detection algorithms are not anticipated that can detect 100% of all downed conductors, while having 100% security against misoperation. The utilities need an economic solution and a system that can reliably detect high impedance faults and are also secure in that they do not falsely detect a HIF.<br>
Some of the earliest HIF detection schemes involved arcing fault detection technigues that used low frequency current components and are described in B. Russell, K. Mehta, R. Chinchali, "An arcing fault detection technique using low frequency current components performance evaluation using recorded data", IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol.- 3, No. 4, pp. 1493-1500, October 1988. This conventional arcing fault detection technique examined low frequency currents, namely 180 and 210 Hz, to determine whether, an arcing fault had occurred. A hierarchical detection scheme was developed that is based on signature energy and using a dynamic threshold. Although the algorithm was field tested, its performance limited its practical applicability.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,466,071 entitled »High Impedance Fault Detection Apparatus and Method" describes a<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
3<br>
conventional high impedance fault detection technique<br>
that monitors and evaluates the high frequency components<br>
of ea"ch cycle of an alternating current. The occurrence<br>
of a high impedance fault is determined based on a<br>
significant increase in magnitude of the high frequency¦<br>
components for a prescribed period of time and of a<br>
prescribed pattern. However, this patent only considers a<br>
very specific feature of high impedance fault currents<br>
and does not consider high impedance fault currents in a<br>
multi-resolution framework. U.S. Patent No. 5,512,832<br>
entitled "Energy Analysis Fault Detection System7'<br>
describes a conventional detection technique that<br>
compares energy values of load currents to preset<br>
thresholds in order to detect an arcing fault on a power<br>
line. However, this patent is very basic in its. nature,<br>
and does not consider or use other features of load<br>
currents to detect a fault.	. •<br>
Another HIF detection scheme devised a neural network detection system that is trained to identify HIF faults and is described in S. Ebron, D. Lubkeman, an M. White, "A neural network approach to the detection of incipient faults on power distribution feeders", IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 905-914, April 1990. Although this study was conducted in the early days of neural network development it did highlight the potential of adaptive learning systems in HIF detection. That pilot study did not involve any experimentally generated data but was developed and tested using simulated HIF data generated using electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) software. • Furthermore, the neural network used in that study had a relatively simple architecture.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,537,327 entitled "Method and Apparatus For Detecting High-Impedance Faults In Electrical Power Systems" describes a conventional high impedance fault detection technique that uses a neural<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
4<br>
network to detect high impedance faults. However, the<br>
features used by U.S. Patent No. 5,537,327, rely on<br>
derivatives of the maxima and minima of the load current.<br>
Also, zero crossings are used to detect a fault.. The<br>
results of long term HIF detection tests conducted .with<br>
the collaboration of five utilities and including staged<br>
faults, naturally occurring faults, and normal system<br>
operation were published by B. Russell and C. Benner, in<br>
"Arcing fault detection for distribution feeders:<br>
security assessment in long term field trials", -.IEEE<br>
Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 676-<br>
683, April 1995. ' That study described in great detail<br>
• some of the practical' aspects of HIF detection, but it<br>
does show that a 75% HIF detection was the best<br>
achievable performance using their randomness based<br>
algorithm.	¦<br>
British Columbia Hydro and Powertech Labs Inc. tested three HIF detection systems including that of Russell et al. described directly above ,(see, V. Bucholz, M. Nagpol, J. Nielson, B. Parsi, and W. Zarecki, "High impedance fault detection device tester", IEEE transactions "on Power Delivery, Vol; 11, No. 1, pp. 184-190, January 1996). The most significant result was that the higher frequencies of HIF signatures played an important role in HIF detection and in distinguishing HIF from other types of faults or normal arcing operations.<br>
In another HIF detection study, the results of years of experience with HIF detection and testing are summarized and the formal evaluation of the performance of a randomness based HIF detection algorithm are disclosed, (see, C. Benner and B. Russell, "Practical high impedance fault detection on distribution feeders", IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Vol. 33, No. 3, pp. 635-640, May/June 1997). Despite its simplicity, and its ad hoc nature, this .algorithm.'does deliver relatively reliable HIF detection. This technique was implemented<br><br>

in a relay sold by General Electric known as the Digital Feeder Monitor (DFM) and uses nine algorithms based mainly on energy, randomness, interharmonics, etc. in layers as shown in Figure 4 on page 8 by R. Patterson, W. Tyska, B. Don Russell and B. Michael Aucoin, "A Microprocessor-Based Digital Feeder Monitor With High-Impedance Fault Detection", presented to the Forty-Seventh . Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX, March 21-23, 1994. In contrast the technique of the present invention as described in the preferred embodiment uses only three algorithms based on neural networks, statistics and wavelets and has a voting scheme that determines the detection of the HIF fault based on each of the algorithms independently detecting a HIF condition.<br>

The networks were trained by feeding them with input vectors consisting of magnitudes or phase angles of low order harmonics. The present invention uses a neural network algorithm which is different as it is a multiple-layer perceptron that uses the waveform samples as an input, not the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the low order harmonics.<br>

However, there is a^ significant difference between the • two algorithms. The algorithm in this paper is alsp a multi-layer network with back-propagation, but this algorithm uses the DFT of the current and voltage, signals as Inputs, instead of the individual samples themselves. This paper does not indicate the number of inputs, outputs, and hidden layers associated with the network, and tests the algorithm using EMTP/ATP simulations.<br>
As can be appreciated, conventional means for detecting high impedance faults in electrical power lines are typically not always conclusive and/or reliable and can be expensive. Therefore, a need exists for a new reliable and economic solution for detecting high impedance faults in electrical power lines which addresses the engineering and legal ramifications of detecting and determining what to do once a high impedance fault is detected.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment(s)<br>
The present invention considers high impedance faults in a multi-resolution framework. The present invention relates to a new approach to high impedance fault detection that includes a multi-scheme high impedance fault detection . scheme employing a plurality of individual fault detection systems each having their own algorithm application that use various features of phase and/or ground currents to individually detect a high impedance fault. Suitable features of the currents include their wavelength signatures, their fourth order moment, their sample values as seen by a neural net, and the like. FIGURE 1 shows a schematic diagram of an electrical power distribution system having an electrical power distribution line 10 and a composite high impedance detection system 12. The solid vertical bars in Fig. 1 are bus bars 16 and represent the interconnection of multiple distribution lines. The composite high impedance detection system 12 includes a plurality of individual high impedance fault detection systems which are not shown in Fig. 1 but are shown in Fig. 2. Also shown in Fig. 1 are the potential transformer PT and the<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
11<br>
current transformer CT which provide the typical analog inputs for a protective relay.<br>
These individual high impedance fault detection systems have individual algorithms for individually detecting high impedance faults. These algorithms can use, for example, wavelet, higher order statistics, neural network, and the like to identify the presence of high impedance fault independently of each of the other system algorithms. The individual high impedance fault detection algorithms can each have a different confidence level. A fault is identified' as a high impedance fault once it is detected independently by the algorithms and processed through a decision logic.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary composite high impedance fault detection system 12 including a higher: order statistics based high impedance fault, detection system 20 identified in Fig. 2 as a 2nd order statistical system 22, a wavelet based high impedance detection system 24, and a neutral network based high impedance detection system 26. As shown in Figure 2, an input connection 28 labeled "Acquisition" in Fig. 2 and an output connection 30 labeled "Detection decision" in Fig. 2 are provided for communicating an electrical signal between the electrical power distribution system and the high impedance fault detection systems 22, 24, 26.<br>
For example, the input connection 28 receives an electrical signal from a sensing device coupled to the electrical power distribution line. The sensing device can include any suitable sensing device, such as the current transformer shown in Fig. 1. The output of acquisition 28 is processed through data filtering 29 which provides band limited signals to each individual high impedance fault detection systems 22, 24, 26.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, each individual high impedance fault detection system 22, 24, 26 includes a logical output that is communicated to the composite high<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
12"<br>
impedance fault detection system shown in Fig. 2 as ¦"Decision Logic" 32 which determines whether a high impedance fault has occurred. The composite high impedance fault detection system detects and identifies a<br>
 fault as a high impedance fault once it determines that at least two individual high impedance fault detection systems 22, 24, 26 have independently detected a high impedance fault. This composite feature provides<br>
 increased security against false identification while improving the probability of detecting all high impedance faults. Each high impedance fault detection system 22f~ 24, 26 and its associated algorithm, as well as the composite algorithm' are discussed in detail below.<br>
The output connection, that is "Detection decision" 30 of Decision Logic 32 provides the logical output from each of the individual wavelet based high impedance detection systems, that is, the higher order statistics based high impedance detection system 22, the wavelet based high impedance detection system 24 and the neural network based high impedance detection system 26, to the composite high impedance detection system.<br>
The higher order statistics based high impedance detection system 22, the wavelet based high impedance detection system 24 and the neural network based high impedance detection system 26 and the decision logic 32 are implemented in a microprocessor which is also used for implementing non-HIF detection algorithms such as protection, other than HIF detection, and control algorithms and if desirable metering and/or monitoring algorithms. Thus in the present invention, one microprocessor is used for implementing both non-HIF detection and HIF detection algorithms.<br>
Fig. 2a shows in block diagram form a typical embodiment for acquisition 28, filtering 30, high impedance fault detection system 20 and decision logic 30 of Fig. 2 as well as other elements typically associated<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
13<br>
with a protective relay. As is shown in Fig. 2a, acquisition 28 is the combination of the potential transformer PT and current transformer CT shown in Fig. 1 , whose outputs are filtered by an associated one of filters 21 and provided to a multiplexer 23.<br>
The output of multiplexer 23 is connected by an analog to digital converter 25 to the input of digital • signal processor 27. The embodiment shown in Fig. 2a also includes a memory 32 and a CPU board 34 which includes a microprocessor 34a, a random access memory 34b and a read only memory 34c. As was described above in connection with Fig. 2, each of the individual high impedance fault detection systems 22, 24, 26 shown in that figure are implemented in microprocessor 34a. Also as was described above in connection with Fig. 2, microprocessor 34a is also used for implementing non-HIF detection algorithms such as protection, other than HIF detection, and control algorithms and if desirable metering and/or monitoring algorithms. The output of CPU board 34, which is an indication that a high impedance fault or a non-high impedance fault condition was determined is connected to alarming 36. Test Data<br>
FIGURE 3 shows in simplified form an exemplary laboratory model that was developed to experimentally stage high impedance faults and to collect data for testing and evaluation. The exemplary setup included two 120/4500 V, 1 kVA transformers 42 connected in parallel and energized from a 120 V, 15 A, 60 Hz power source 40. As shown in Figure 3, a bare conductor 46 was connected to one terminal of the transformer secondaries to simulate a downed transmission line. The other secondary terminal was connected to a copper plate 44 buried in soil 48, thereby simulating the ground electrode and the earth.<br><br>

The bare conductor was dropped on a variety of soil surfaces to investigate differences in the resulting currents. The. HIF current signatures were collected using a data acquisition system based upon the use of National Instruments data acquisition and signal conditioning boards with Lab-VIEW software operating on Windows NT. The data was sampled at 20 kHz, quantized to 14 bits and stored in binary format. Each HIF trial case was conducted for a 50 second duration.<br>
Fifteen cases were run for seven' different wet surface conditions (wet and frozen sod, soil, asphalt, gravel, sand, and concrete) for a total of 105 HIF cases'. This data acquisition scheme was also used to collect signatures for non-HIF currents for single-phase nonlinear loads (e.g., TV, fluorescent lamp, PC, bridge rectifier, a phase-controlled motor drive, and arc welder). A total of 22 non-HIF files were created. . Signal Model<br>
The HIF detection algorithms developed in this exemplary study are based on using HIF current signatures in all of the 3-phases and/or ground which are considered non stationary, temporally varying, and of various burst duration. Even though 'HIF signals do resemble the third harmonic component of the current, other harmonic components as well as non-harmonic components can play a vital role in HIF detection. One challenge is to develop a data model that acknowledges that high impedance faults could take place at any time within the observation window of the current and could be delayed randomly and attenuated substantially depending on the fault location away from the measuring station. The exemplary model is motivated by previous HIF research, actual experimental observations in the lab, and what traditionally represents an accurate depiction of a non stationary signal with time dependent spectrum.<br><br>

The HIF detection problem addressed in this exemplary study is formulated as such:<br>
Hypothesis HO : r(t) = s(t) + n(t)	(1)<br>
Hypothesis HI : r(t) = s(t) + n(t) + f(t) (2)<br>
where r(t) represents the monitored phase and/or ground currents. It is assumed that all current recordings are corrupted with additive Gaussian noise n(t). The HIF signature is denoted by f (t) and represents the instantaneous value of the. HIF current. Normal load signals are denoted by" s(t) and thus Hypothesis HO represents a no HIF situation and Hypothesis HI represents a HIF situation.<br>
High Impedance Fault (HIF) Detection using Wavelet Based System<br>
FIGURE 4 is a flowchart showing an exemplary wavelet based HIF detection application. After the data is acquired in 50, it is filtered in 52, using a bandpass filter of 320-400 Hz, and then, as is described in detail . below, it is decomposed in separate high and low pass wavelet decomposition filters in 54. The energy is then calculated in 56 and the calculated energy is compared to a threshold in 58 to determine if a HIF has occurred.<br>
The following is an exemplary application of high impedance fault detection using a wavelet based high impedance fault detection system. The continuous wavelet transform of Hi?) is<br><br>
The position argument keeps track of the temporal change in current harmonics which is essential to HIF detection and the scale change keeps track of bands of frequencies of the current load. Both position and scale<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
16<br><br>
The above transform is implemented by multi resolution analysis where the signal is decomposed into a low pass and a high pass component via two separate low pass and high pass filters known as wavelet decomposition filters. After filtering, both low pass and high pass signals are down sampled by a factor of 2. The high pass signal component corresponds to the first detail look of the signal. The second detail look can be obtained by further decomposition of the current low pass signal.into two new low pass and high pass components. The third/ fourth, etc. detail signals can be obtained by further decomposition of subsequent low pass components.<br>
The original signal can be reconstructed with minimal' error from its low pass and high pass components in a reverse pyramidal manner. It is in these high pass components where distinct HIF features can be located and distinguished from signatures of other nonlinear loads of transient and bursty nature. The decomposition filters are associated with the type of mother wavelet used.<br>
Most of the exemplary tests of this technique were<br>
conducted using the Daubechies-4 wavelet which is not a<br>
very smooth wavelet but requires less computation time.<br>
Use of other wavelets or other Daubechies wavelets did<br>
not show any noticeable change in performance nor in the<br>
threshold parameters used.	. •<br>
The exemplary HIF detection algorithm developed for the wavelet based system examines overlapping windows of the current at different scales and details via a wavelet transform. Although proper HIF detection can be accomplished using more than a single scale, experimental<br><br>

17<br>
seventh detail signal carries the most significant HIF information that is more distinguishable from other normal arcing load's or normal nonlinear loads. The additional preprocessing needed is a FFT to render the current with all its random delay components position insensitive.<br>
Thus, the preferred algorithm relies on evaluating the energy of the seventh detail signal of the magnitude of the FFT of a current. That energy is compared to a fixed threshold and to the energy of the previous data segment. The combined decision results in a fault/no fault determination. This detection scheme delivers about 80% detection with about a 0.5% false alarm rate in the absence of arc welding loads. If the HIF attenuation parameters were lower limited to 0.1 (i.e. typically high impedance fault detection systems are not interested in detecting very weak currents), the detection rate increases to about 95% with about a 0.1% false alarm rate. The detection performance drops to about 65% in the presence of arc welding signals and without considering any lower limits on attenuation. The false alarm rate remains under about 1%.<br>
The seventh detail signal obtained via wavelet decomposition corresponds to the frequency range between the second and fifth harmonic (about 156-312 Hz) . The importance of the proposed detection scheme is in considering the third, fourth, and fifth harmonic as well as the in-between harmonics frequencies as a block of features for HIF detection. Furthermore, the temporal change in HIF currents is accounted for in the temporal change of the seventh detail signal.<br>
High Impedance Fault (HIF) Detection using Higher Order Statistics Based System<br>

filter of 320-400 Hz. The data acquisition and filtering in this application are both the same as the data acquisition and filtering described for the wavelet based HIF detection system of Fig. 4 and thus have in Fig. 5 the same reference numerals as is used in Fig. 4 for those functions. The energy is then calculated in 60 and the calculated energy is compared to a threshold in 62 to determine if a HIF has occurred.<br>
An exemplary detection system and algorithm based on examining the higher, order statistical features of normal currents has been developed and tested, as discussed below. Higher order spectra, namely the bispectrum and trispectr'um are traditionally recognized as important feature extraction mechanisms that are associated with. the third and fourth order cumulants of- random signals. The bispectrum and the trispectrum are by definition the. two dimensional and three dimensional Fourier transform' of the third and fourth order cumulants defined as,<br>
C2(m,n) = E{r(t)r(t + m)r(t + n)}	(5) •<br>
C3(m,n,k) = E{r(t)r(t + m)r(t + n)r(t + k)} (6)<br>
where E stands for the expected value.<br>
The exemplary algorithm implemented in this study is due in part to Tugnait (see, J. Tugnait, "Detection of Random Signals by Integrated Polyspectral Analysis", IEEE Transactions on Signal processing, Vol. 44, No. 8, pp. 2102-2108, August 1996) and utilizes the integrated polyspectra of single-phase current loads. This reference in incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The detector is developed such that a detection decision is made either using second order statistics at a preliminary stage or using third and fourth order statistics at an additional stage. The basic concept is as follows: what is the achievable detection decision assuming accessibility to second, third, and fourth order<br><br>

alarm rate. First, it is determined whether a fault exists using only second order statistics. If the detection cannot be made, an alternative test based on third and fourth order cumulants is triggered. Both tests combined are designed such that the probability of false . alarm is fixed and predetermined by the system operator. Clearly, this detector uses additional information beyond energy signatures.<br>
Preferably, this detector relies on all current • spectra including the in-between harmonics as generated by the pre-processing filter described earlier. The HIF, detector is itemized as follows:<br><br><br>

Thus, wm represents all the spectral components of the recorded current. The real and imaginary components are denoted by Re and Im respectively.

High Impedance Fault (HIF) Detection using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)<br>
FIGURE 6 is a flowchart showing neural network based HIF detection application. The data is acquired in 50, it is filtered in 52 using a bandpass filter of 320-400 Hz. The data acquisition and filtering in this application are both the same as the data acquisition and filtering described for the wavelet based HIF detection system of Fig. 4 and thus have in Fig. 6 the same reference numerals as is used in Fig. 4 for those functions. The samples are transformed in 64 using a<br><br>

second neural network embodiment described below, and then mapped into the HIF plane in 66 using the neural network algorithm and compared to a threshold in 68 to determine if a HIF has occurred.<br>
The following is an exemplary application of high impedance fault detection using a neural network based high impedance fault detection system. Artificial' Neural<br>
,i<br>
Networks (ANNs) have been successfully used in many applications to solve complex classification problems due to their ability to create non-linear decision boundaries. The most common and flexible neural network is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) which is constructed from a series of neurons.<br>
The first neural networks investigated used 1000 input nodes to the network (1000 samples over 3 cycles at 20 kHz) . No attempt was made to synchronize the zero crossing of the monitored current to the first input node of the neural , network with the hopes of reducing implementation complexity. The best results occurred when' using 200 nodes in the hidden layer. ' The network was trained with 600 input/target cases (300 HIF and 300 non-HIF) and' had a sum-squared error of 1.4 after completion of learning (1 missed HIF detection and 0 false alarms) . Generalization performance was determined by testing the network on 3600 new 3 cycle windows (1800 HIF and 1800 non-HIF). Considering all network output greater than 0.5 to indicate the presence of an HIF event, the network achieved a detection rate of 70.83% with a 22.06% false alarm rate.<br>
One embodiment of a neural network design used the spectrum of the 3-cycle window of data. The magnitude of the FFT of the 1000 samples was truncated at the 13th harmonic. This resulted in a reduction to only 40 input nodes for the neural network. This network had fewer weights and biases and could be trained almost an order-of maqnitude faster. The best results occurred when 30<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
23<br>
nodes were used in the hidden layer. The network was<br>
trained with 600 cases and had a sum-squared error of<br>
11.8 (8 missed detections and 4 false alarms).<br>
Generalization testing on 3600 new inputs resulted in<br>
about an 86.0;6% detection rate with about a 17.06% false<br>
alarm rate. The increased performance of this network<br>
over the previous network is likely due to the invariance<br>
of the frequency spectrum to phase shifts. These<br>
performance figures are once again based upon using about<br>
0.5 as the output threshold for indicating a detected<br>
HIF. An attempt was made to reduce the false alarm rate<br>
by increasing the output threshold to about 0.75. This<br>
resulted in about a 83.7% detection rate with about a<br>
14.8% false alarm rate. Increasing the threshold to<br>
about 0.95 resulted in about a 77.7% detection rate and<br>
about a 11.8% false alarm rate. 	<br>
Another exemplary network architecture was a combination of the two previous networks operating in parallel. If the output of both networks was greater, than 0.5, then a positive HIF decision was indicated. A decision that no HIF was present was made if the output of both networks was less than 0.5. For the. cases in which the two neural networks disagreed as to the presence of a HIF current, the output of the two networks was summed and a variable threshold was used to make the decision. A threshold of 1.0 corresponded to making the final decision based upon which network was more confident in its own decision.<br>
For example, if the output of network 1 was 0.9867 and the output of network 2 was 0.0175, then the sum would be less than 1.0 and a no HIF decision would be made because the output of network 2 is closer to the ideal value of 0 than the output of network 1 is to the ideal value of 1.<br>
On the other hand, if a more conservative approach were desired in which one chose to reduce the false alarm<br><br>
WO 2005/076428	PCT/US2005/002958<br>
24<br>
rate, a larger threshold approaching 1.5 could be selected. In essence, a larger threshold gives more weight to the network that indicates a no HIF situation.<br>
Table 1 summarizes the performance as this threshold is varied.<br><br>
The results indicate that the network using the spectrum (FFT) of the monitored current is more capable of detecting HIF than the network using the actual current samples. Using the sampled current network in tandem with the spectrum based network can reduce the false alarm rates, however, it doesn't appear to increase the detection rate significantly. The lack of synchronizing the current's zero-crossing during training and generalization may prohibit this neural network from detecting some of the patterns or features attributed to HIFs, such as asymmetry of half cycles and variations from cycle to cycle. The results are encouraging given that the detection is performed on only a 3 cycle snapshot of data.<br>
High Impedance Fault (HIF) Detection using a Composite System<br>
Referring once again to Fig. 2 there is shown an exemplary composite HIF detection system 12 that includes all of the three different techniques described above.<br>
As can be seen from the test results of the three different HIF techniques 22, 24, 26 described above, none of them can detect all HIF faults while assuring no false alarms. The present invention evaluates the presence of<br><br>
