				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	This invention relates generally to air conditioning systems and,<br>
more particularly, to an air conditioning system for the rooftop of a bus.<br>
[0003]	It is recognized, that because of the wide variety of bus types and<br>
application requirements, it has been necessary to provide many different types and variations of air conditioning systems in order to meet these different requirements and vehicle interfaces. As a result, the manufacturing and installation costs, and sustaining engineering resources that are necessary in order to properly maintain and service these units, are relatively high.<br>
[0004]	The common approach for bus rooftop air conditioners is to provide<br>
a base frame of rather substantial structural members. The various components of the system are then mounted on or within the base frame, which is then attached to the bus rooftop. Such a frame adds significantly to the cost of a system.<br>
[0005]	Also associated with the existing bus air conditioning systems is the<br>
problem of a component failure causing a compete loss of the air conditioning capacity. That it. with a single large unit as is now customary, failure of that unit such as, for example, a leaking hose causing loss of refrigerant, an electrical failure leading to inoperation of one of the components such as a fan, or a compressor failure, the entire unit is inoperable and no air conditioning can be provided to the unit. In such a situation, it would preferable if partial capacity could be maintained in order to provide a"limp home"capability.<br>
[0006]	Traditionally, the condenser coils and fans have been located near<br>
the centerline of the bus rooftop, whereas the evaporator coils and fans are closer to the lateral sides of the rooftop. Further, the evaporator fans are of the draw-through type w herein the evaporator fans are placed downstream of the coils and act to draw the conditioned air from the coils. This provides a uniform velocity<br><br>
distribution at the coil but leads to undesirable high jet flow off the fan and subsequently pushing into the bus ducting system. Also, because of the need to have the fan outboard of the coil, it has been necessary to place the coil more toward the center of the bus than might otherwise be desired, further, draw through disadvantages include hold up condensate due to the negative pressure at the drain pay, and that negative pressure can draw back undesirable gases from the bus lower area, such as exhaust gases.<br>
[0007]	It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved bus rooftop air conditioning system.<br>
[0008]	Another object of the present invention is the provision for a bus air<br>
conditioning system which is effective at all engine operating speeds of the bus, while at the same time does not require an oversized compressor.<br>
[0009]	Yet another object of the present invention is the provision for<br>
reducing the manufacturing, installation, and maintenance costs of a bus air conditioning system.<br>
[0010]	Still another object of the present invention is that of providing an<br>
air conditioning system that is designed for adaptability of use in various types of installation configurations.<br>
[0011]	Another object of the present invention is that of providing a"limp<br>
home"capability in the event of certain component failures.<br>
[0012]	Still another object of the present invention is the provision in an<br>
evaporator section of a bus rooftop air conditioning system for locating the evaporator coil more toward the lateral edges of the bus.<br><br>
 [0013]	Still another object is to avoid the problem of negative pressure at<br>
the drain pan.<br>
[0014]	Yet another object of the present invention is the provision for a bus<br>
rooftop air conditioning system which is economical to manufacture and effective in use.<br>
[0015]	These objects  and  other features and advantages become  more<br>
readily apparent upon reference to the following descriptions when taken in conjunction with the appended drawings.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0016]	Briefly,  in accordance with one aspect of the invention, an air<br>
conditioning module is assembled with its condenser coil, evaporator coil and respective blowers located within the module and so situated that a standard module can accommodate various installation interfaces with different types and locations of return air and supply air ducts on a bus.<br>
[0017]	In accordance with another aspect of the invention, rather than a<br>
large single air conditioning unit, a plurality of relatively small modules can be installed on the roof of a bus. with each being capable of operating independently of the others so as to allow for the relatively low cost mass production of identical standardized units and also provide for a limp home capability in the event of failure of one or more units.<br>
[0018]	In accordance with another aspect of the  invention,  each  of a<br>
plurality of modules are installed in a centered relationship with respect to a longitudinal centerline of the bus and extend transversely across the width of the bus. A single unit with one condenser section and one evaporator section is provided and a double unit with two evaporator sections and two condenser<br><br>
sections are also provided. The number and combination of such modules installed is dependent on the total air conditioning capacity requirement of the bus, and the evaporator sections can be easily ganged to meet with a single return air opening in the bus.<br>
[0019]	In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the modules have<br>
an integrated framework in that various components are assembled in a unibody arrangement to provide structural support for the system.<br>
[0020]	By yet another aspect of the invention, each of the modules include<br>
all the necessary components with electrical power being provided to the electrical components by an inverter/controller that is powered by an engine driven generator.<br>
[0021]	By another aspect of the invention, the evaporator blower is placed<br>
inboard of the evaporator coils and acts to blow air from the return air duct through the coils to be cooled and provide pressurized condensate system thus avoiding condensate hold up and introduction of external gases.<br>
[0022]	By still another aspect of the invention the evaporator section of the<br>
module has a return air plenum that spans a substantial width of the bus to thereby accommodate various sizes and types of return air interface requirements.<br>
[0023]	In the drawings as hereinafter described, a preferred embodiment is<br>
depicted: however various other modifications and alternate constructions can be made thereto without departing from the true sprit and scope of the invention.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0033]	The  inventive  module as  a single unit configuration  is shown<br>
generally at 10 as applied to the rooftop 11 of a bus in accordance with the present invention. Electrical power is provided to the module 10 by way of line 12, which in turn receives its power from a generator 13 driven by the bus engine 14 as shown.<br><br>
 [0034]	The module 10 interfaces with openings in the bus top so that fans<br>
within the module 10 cause the return air from the passenger compartment to flow upward into the module 10 where it is conditioned, and the conditioned air to then flow downwardly into supply air ducts that carry the conditioned air to the passenger compartment. The various structures and the manner in which they interface with the bus rooftop 11 will more fully described hereinafter.<br>
[0035]	In Fig. 2, the module 10 is shown with its electrical connection by-<br>
way of line 12 to the generator 13 and driving engine/motor 14. An inverter/controller 22 receives AC power from the generator, or alternator, and, in turn provides discretely controlled AC power to evaporator blower motors 23 and 24. a drive motor 31 of the condenser fan 27 and a drive motor 32 of a compressor 21. A plurality of control sensors, shown generally at 33 provide feedback to the inverter/controller 22 as necessary for it to control the AC power being delivered to the various drive motors.<br>
[0036]	As will be seen, the refrigeration circuit is a closed circuit through<br>
which the refrigerant flows from the compressor 21 to the condenser coils 28 and 29 an expansion valve 34, to one or more evaporator coils 25 and 26 and finally back to the compressor 21. This refrigerant flow configuration is accomplished in a conventional manner.<br>
[0037]	It will be seen that the module 10 is self-contained with all of the<br>
necessary components including he compressor 21 and its drive motor 32. with the only input thereto being the electrical power by way of the electrical line 12. Other modules, indicated as numbers 2-6 are identically configured and are powered and controlled in the same manner. In this regard, it should be mentioned that the present invention is also applicable to a module in which the compressor is not included within the module but is rather located near and driven by the motor 14.<br><br>
In such case the refrigerant lines are interconnected from the compressor to the module (s).<br>
[0038]	Referring now to Figs. 3-7, a single unit version (a double unit<br>
version thereof will be described hereinafter), of the module 10 as shown with its cover removed to include an evaporator section 36 and a condenser section 37.<br>
These two sections are fabricated separately in the factor}' and then brought together in parallel relationship and secured together to complete the module as will be described hereinafter. The module is intended, and is designed, to be mounted on the rooftop of a bus with each of the two sections extending transversely across the rooftop of a bus, in a straddling relationship with the longitudinal centerline thereof.<br>
[0039]	Within the condenser section 36, the condenser fan is mounted on a<br>
base 38 with its axis oriented vertically, and connected to be driven by an electric motor 31. On either side thereof, the condenser coils 28 and 29 are mounted in a combined V shape as shown. As shown in Fig. 5, the flow of air is caused by the condenser fan 27 as shown by the arrows. Fresh air is drawn in through the fresh air intake openings 39 and 41, passes through the respective condenser coils 28 and 29, with the resulting warm air being discharged upwardly to the atmosphere by the fan 27.<br>
[0040]	It is significant to note that both the condenser section 36 and<br>
evaporator section 37 are of the"frameless"type. That is, in prior art arrangements, a framework has been provided wherein the various components are either mounted on or within the supporting framework. In the present design, the various components make up a"unibody", such that the components themselves form the framework.<br><br>
 [0041]	Referring again to Fig. 3, a pair of V-shaped central panels (one<br>
being shown in 42) are secured at its oblique edges to the tube sheets of the respective coils 28 and 29. and at its lower horizontal edge to the base 38 by fasteners of the like. Also attached to the tube sheets of the coils 28 and 29 are the respective pairs of spaced side panels 43 and 44, with the pair of spaced side panels 43 then being interconnected by an end panel 46, and the pair of spaced side panels 44 being interconnected by an end panel 47. Thus, rather than having frame members that extend the length of the module 36. the structural members as described hereinabove are fastened together, including the tube sheets of the coils 28 and 29, to jointly comprise a structural body of the module 36.<br>
[0042]	The inverter/controller 43 is mounted on a base member 48 which is<br>
interconnected to the lower edge of the side panels 43 and end panel 46. while the compressor 41 is supported by the base member 49 which is interconnected to the lower edges of the side member 44 and the end member 47.<br>
[0043]	Considering now the evaporator section 37 as shown in Fig. 3, and<br>
in a different perceptive in Figs. 4.6 and 7, in addition to the evaporator coils 25 and 26 that are located near the ends of the evaporator section 37. a pair of evaporator fans 51 and 52, as driven by the motors 23 and 24, respectively, are provided.<br>
Further, just outside of the evaporator coils 25 and 26 are the respective heating coils 53 and 54.<br>
[0044]	In operation, the evaporator blower fans 51 and 52 draw in return air<br>
from the passenger compartment of the bus, pass it through the scroll structures 56 and 57 (see Fig. 7), pass it through the coils as described hereinabove in order to heat or cool the air, and then return it to the passenger compartment of a bus.<br><br>
[0045]	Returning   now  to  the   discussion   of the"frameless"or"unibody"<br>
construction, with respect to the evaporator section 37, reference is made primarily to Fig. 4. Similar to the condenser section 36, a pair of spaced central panels, one of which is shown at 58, extends over most of the length of the module 37. However, its oblique ends are attached to the tube sheets of the coils 25 and 26, and the opposite edge of the tube sheets are then attached to the triangular shaped side panels 59 and 61 to complete the side structure of the module 37. End panels 62 and 63 are then interconnected between the respective side structures as shown. Thus, in the same manner as described hereinabove with respect to the condenser section 36, the tube sheets of the heat exchanger coils 25 and 26 are interconnected with other elements of the module structure to collectively form a framework in a unibody fashion.<br>
[0046]	Referring again to Figs. 6 and 7, further discussions of the air flow<br>
through the evaporator unit 37 is warranted. As mentioned hereinabove, the module as shown in Fig. 6 straddles the longitudinal centerline of a bus as it extends transversely across the rooftop of the bus. Depending on the type and size of the bus, the position (s) of the return air opening (s) may vary substantially in the longitudinal direction and also in the lateral direction. For example, in a relatively narrow bus, one or more return air openings are more likely to be at or near the longitudinal centerline of the bus, whereas with a wide bus installation, it is likely that a pair of return air openings will be located on either side, and at a substantial distance from the longitudinal centerline of the bus. The present module is therefore designed to accommodate these various installations requirements with a single module design. The design features which accommodate the various lateral locations of the return air opening will now be discussed, and the features which accommodate the various longitudinal positions of the return air opening will be discussed hereinafter.<br><br>
[0047]	As will be, seen in Fig. 6, a relatively long (in the transverse<br>
direction) return air plenum 64 is provided between the lower inner edges of the respective evaporator coils 25 and 26. The length of that plenum is shown at LI, and is such that the return air opening (s) can be located anywhere along that length, such that fluid communication will be provided between these return air openings and the evaporator fans 51 and 52. This dimension L, can be quantified by comparing it with the overall length. L2. of the unit (not including the cowlings that are added to accommodate the flow of the air to the supply air openings in the bus by way of the conduits 68 and 69). Thus, the ratio L1/L2 of the present design is 1190 mm/1450 mm or about 82%.<br>
[0048]	Another way to quantify the dimension LI is to compare it with the<br>
width of a bus top. A typical bus top has an average transverse width of about 2150 mm. Thus, the ratio of L1/L3 equals 1190/2150 or about 55%.<br>
[0049]	In operation, the relatively warm return air flow upwardly from a<br>
one or more return air openings and enters the return air plenum 64. The evaporator fans 51 and 52 cause the return air to flow upwardly to their inlets at the top. and at the same time, fresh air may be brought in by way of the fresh air openings 66 and 67 (see Fig. 7). A mixture of the two air flows streams is thus admitted at the intake of the evaporator fans 51 and 52 and caused to flow outwardly through the evaporator coils 25 and 26, the heating coils 53 and 54, and finally to flow through the supply air conduits 68 and 69 to the supply air inlets to the bus.<br>
[0050]	So   far.  the  discussion  has  been  with  respect  to  a  single  unit<br>
configuration wherein the module includes a single condenser section 36 and a single evaporator section 37. and with the condenser section including an inverter/controller and a compressor.<br><br>
[0051]	In the interests of economy and that of accommodating various air<br>
conditioning capacities with simple and effective combination that can be easily adapted through the return air and supply air openings in the bus rooftop, a double unit configuration has been devised as shown in Fig. 8. Here, rather than a single condenser section, a pair of condenser sections 71 and 72 are provided adjacent each other. Similarly, rather than a single evaporator section, a pair of evaporator sections 73 and 74 are provided adjacent each other as shown. Within each of the condenser sections 71 and 72, respective compressors 76 and 77 are provided. However, when combining the condenser sections in this manner, it is not necessary to provide two invertors/controllers, since a single inverter/controller 78 will suffice for the entire double unit module configuration. Most of the other components of the condenser sections 71 and 72 are identical to those for the single unit configuration. However, rather than providing four condenser coils, on each side of the condenser fan the adjacent coil pairs are joined to form a single coil with a central tube sheet 79 extending the length of the unit as shown. In this way, the combination of the two condenser sections 71 and 72 provide twice the capacity as that of a single section configuration, costs are reduced because of the use of two long condenser coils rather than four short ones, and the cost of one inverter/controller is saved.<br>
[0052]	Referring now to the evaporator section 73 and 74. in the same<br>
manner as described hereinabove with respect to a condenser section coils, the evaporator coils of the adjacent sections 73 and 74 are joined to form two long coils rather than four short coils, and again, a center tube sheet 81 is provided to extend across the length of the unit, between the sections 73 and 74.<br>
[0053] In addition to the savings that result from use of two long coils rather than four short coils, this design positions the fans of the two adjacent sections 73 and 74, along with their return air plenum, right next to each other. This allows for the<br><br>
two return air inlet plenums to have their respective return air openings longitudinally adjacent to each other (or combined in a single opening) as will now be described.<br>
[0054]	With the use of one or more single unit configurations, and one or<br>
more double unit configurations as described hereinabove, a combination may be used to obtain a total capacity that meets the needs of the particular bus installation.<br>
Further, because of the ability to place the evaporator sections in adjacent positions, the adaptation of the various units can be easily made to register with a single return air opening, irrespective of the capacity level.<br>
[0055]	Referring now to Fig. 9a, a single unit configuration is shown with a<br>
single condenser section C and a single evaporator section E. with a relatively short (longitudinally) return air opening 83 and supply air openings 84.<br>
[0056] In Fig. 9b, a double unit module is shown with a pair of condenser sections CI and C2 and a pair of evaporator sections El and E2. A single return air opening 86 extends longitudinally over twice the length as the return air opening 83 and the supply air openings 87.<br>
[0057]	In Fig. 9c, a double unit configuration is provided as in Fig. 9b, and<br>
then a single unit configuration, as shown in Fig. 9a, is rotated 180A° and is then installed such that its evaporator section 83 is adjacent the other evaporator section El. In this way, each of the evaporator sections El. E2 and E3 can share a single return air opening 88 and a single supply air opening 89 on each side as shown.<br>
[0058] Finally, in Fig. 9d, a double unit module (as shown in Fig. 9b) is provided, and then another identical double unit module is rotated 180A° and installed such that the four evaporator sections are disposed adjacent each other and therefore<br><br>
share a common single return air opening 91. Similarly the evaporator sections also share a common supply air opening 92 on each side as shown.<br>
[0059]	While  the   present   invention  has   been   particularly   shown   and<br>
described with reference to a preferred embodiment as illustrated in the drawings, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that various changes and detail may be effected therein without defining from the true sprit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
