				<td>EXTERNAL DECORATING MEMBER FOR A REFRIGERATOR DOOR   <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD	<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a external decorating member for a refrigerator door. PRIOR ART<br>
Generally, a refrigerator generates the cool air using a refrigerating system mounted therein and supplies the cool air into a refrigerating chamber and a freezing chamber so as to freshly preserve the food stored in the refrigerating and freezing chambers for a long time.<br>
A conventional refrigerator includes a main body provided with a refrigerating chamber and a freezing chamber. The refrigerating chamber having a plurality of shelves for placing the food inside the chamber preserves the food at a low temperature by ventilating the cool air. The freezing chamber for preserving frozen food is separated from the refrigerating chamber by a barrier. The freezing and refrigerating chambers may be positioned either up and down or side by side inside the main body.<br>
The main body further includes doors for the refrigerating and freezing chambers. Each door has an outer case made of steel and an inner case made of synthetic resin. The outer case externally decorates the refrigerator and the inner case provides some space between the outer case and itself. The surface of the outer case is covered with paint so that it is not exposed. Also, the space between the outer and   inner cases is filled with an insulator to insulate the<br><br><br>
- 2 -<br>
refrigerator.   Each outer case is provided with a door handle on its surface so that the doors are easily opened or closed.<br>
The refrigerator doors of the prior art, however, have following limitations. Because the doors are formed on the front surfaces of the refrigerating chamber and the freezing chamber respectively, the outer case is directly exposed when the doors are closed. That is, the paint coated on the surface of the outer case is seen. However, because the doors coated with the paint show only a simple colour, the prior art refrigerator cannot satisfy customers with their various tastes.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an external decorating member for a refrigerator door that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator with a more sophisticated and elegant external appearance.<br>

-3-<br>
The glass member is a plate member attached to the front surface of a refrigerator door and has the same size as the front surface of the same. Preferably, the glass member is made of temperated glass having an improved stiffness by being hardened by heat.<br>
It is preferred that the first paint layer has its thickness in the range of 5-20<br>
m  and, more accurately, in the range of 10-15 m . The reflecting material of the first paint layer is made of an inorganic pigment or metal particles. The first paint layer is spontaneously dried at the normal temperature before the second paint layer is formed.<br>
Also, it is preferred that the second paint layer has its thickness in the<br>
range of 5-35 m  and, more accurately, in the range of 10-30 m . The second paint layer is artificially dried by heat.<br>
It is better for both the first and second paint layers to be made of a heat-resisting ceramic pigment. The second paint layer of the external decorating member is respectively provided to the doors so that it comes in contact with the front surface of its corresponding door,<br>
As described above, the refrigerator of the present invention, on the surface of its doors, has the glass member coated with various colours and especially with a pigment having the reflecting material. Accordingly, the refrigerator of the present invention can satisfy consumers with their various tastes and thus the commercial value of the refrigerator also increases.<br><br>

BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the conventional refrigerator includes a main body 1 provided with a refrigerating chamber 2 and a freezing chamber (not shown). The refrigerating chamber 2 having a plurality of shelves 3 for placing the food inside the chamber preserves the food at a low temperature by ventilating the cool air. The freezing chamber for preserving frozen food is separated from the refrigerating chamber 2 by a barrier (not shown). The freezing and refrigerating chambers may be positioned either up and down or side by side inside the main body 1.<br>
The main body further includes doors 5 and 5' for opening and closing the refrigerating and freezing chambers. The doors 5 and 5' each have an outer case 5a made of steel and an inner case 5b made of synthetic resin. The outer case 5a is formed to externally decorate the refrigerator and the inner case 5b is formed to make some space between the outer case 5a and itself. The surface of the outer case 5a is covered with paint so that it is not exposed. Also, the space between the outer and inner cases 5a and 5b is filled with an insulator (not shown) to insulate the refrigerator 2. Each outer case 5a is provided with a<br><br>
-5A-<br>
door handle 5c on its surface so that the doors 5 and 5' are easily opened or closed.<br>
Disadvantages of such prior art has already been stated.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view illustrating a refrigerator with an external decorating member in accordance with the present invention and FIG. 3 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating the external decorating member in accordance with the present invention. In addition, FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken along line l-l shown in FIG. 2 and illustrating   a   refrigerator   door  with   the   external    decorating   member    in<br><br>
accordance with present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, doors 15 and 15' are respectively provided to a refrigerating chamber 12 and a freezing chamber of a main body 10. Each of the doors 15 and 15' have outer and inner cases 15a and 15b. In the present invention, however, an external decorating member 20 is additionally provided on the front surfaces of the outer case of the doors, which are exposed to a user.<br>
Regarding to FIGs. 3 and 4, the external decorating member 20 includes a glass member 22 with a predetermined size, a first paint layer 24 formed on the surface of the glass member 22, and a second paint layer 26 formed on the first paint layer 24.<br>
The external decorating member 20 will be described in more detail with reference to FIG. 5 illustrating a manufacturing process of the external decorating member 20.<br>
The glass "member 22, a plate member attached to the front surface of its corresponding door, makes the first and second paint layers 24 and 26 visible because of the transparent property of itself. Preferably, the glass member 22 has the same size as the front surface of its corresponding door, so as to fully decorate the front surfaces of the doors 15 and 15' . Also, it is preferred that the glass member 22 is made of tempered glass hardened by heat and thus having a high degree of solidity to resist against an external shock.<br>
The first paint layer 24 is formed by coating the<br>
glass  member  22  with  the  paint  containing  certain<br>
reflecting materials (S10) . In this instance, a spray gun<br><br>
for spraying the paint containing the reflecting material on the glass member 22 is used to evenly form the first paint layer 22. The first paint layer 24 is sprayed relatively thinly, that is, in the thickness of 5-20m  (more preferably, in the thickness of 10-15m  ) , so that the second paint layer which is sprayed after the first paint layer can be shown through the first paint layer 24. The reflecting material of the first paint layer 24 may be made of an inorganic paint or metal particles and play a role to reflect light. When light enters the first paint layer 24 through the glass member 22, the reflecting material reflects the light.<br>
The first paint layer 24 is spontaneously dried at the room temperature for a predetermined time after firstly being sprayed (S20).<br>
Then, the paint having a certain color is secondly sprayed on the first paint layer 24 to form the second paint layer 26 (S30) . In this instance, similar to a forming stage of the first paint layer 24, the-spray gun is used to spray the pigment on the first paint layer 24. The second paint layer 26, the final paint layer, should be formed with relatively thick, in the range of 5-35m  (more preferably, in the range of 10-30my ) , so that it is not peeled off easily. The second paint layer 26 may have any colors according to its design.<br>
After the second paint layer 24 is completely formed, it is dried for a predetermined time (S40). Unlike the first paint layer 24, however, the second paint layer 26. is artificially dried by heat. This is because that the<br><br>
9<br>
second paint layer 26 is not easily adhered to the first paint layer 24 due to its similar property to the first paint layer. The appropriate temperature and time for drying the second paint layer 26(S40) would be 200°C and 10 minutes respectively. Also, it is better for the first and second paint layers 24 and 26 to be made of a heat-resisting ceramic material so as not to be carbonized or discolored when heated.<br>
As previously described, when the first and second paint layers 24 and 26 are sprayed on the glass member 22 in order, the reflecting materials of the first paint layer 24 and the color of the second paint layer 2 6 are visible simultaneously. Accordingly, the refrigerator has a more elegant image with various colors and a light reflecting effect on the whole surface of it as well as the surface of its doors 15 and 15' , compared to the prior art refrigerator having a single color only.<br>
Preferably, a protecting film (not shown) is being covered over the second paint layer 26 of the finished external decorating member 20 (S50) , because the second paint layer 26 which is relatively vulnerable to an impact may be scratched on the way of conveyance. In other words, the external decorating member 20 may be conveyed with the protecting film to protect the second paint layer 26, and the protecting film will be detached right before the external decorating member 20 is installed on the refrigerator doors.<br>
Finally,  the  process of installing the external decorating member 20 on the doors 15 and 15' is performed<br><br>
10<br>
(S60). The external decorating member 20 can be installed on the doors 15 and 15' in a way that the second paint layer 26 is exposed, but more preferably, the external decorating member 20 is installed on the doors 15 and 15' in a way that the second paint layer 26 comes in contact with the front surface of its corresponding door {i.e., the surface of the outer case 15a). This is to prevent the second paint layer 26 from belng scratched or peeled off when exposed to the outside. Also, the external decorating member 20 can be installed in various ways. For example, two directional adhesive tape or glue can bs used to install the external decorating member 20 on the door 15, or a predetermined corporate body may be provided to the door 15 to install the external decorating member 26.<br>
The external decorating member 20 itself has an improved stiffness because of the glass member 22 made of tempered glass and thus plays a role of protecting the doors 15 and 15'.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, an external decorating member for doors of a refrigerator has the following advantages.<br>
First, the external decorating member of the present invention increases the commercial value of the refrigerator. When the external decorating member of the present invention is attached to the front surfaces of the refrigerator doors, first and . second paint layers are exposed through a glass member. Accordingly, various colors and a twinkling effect make the refrigerator look<br><br>
11<br>
more elegant. Thus, the refrigerator of the present invention satisfies consumers with their various tastes, resulting in more demand for the product.<br>
Second, The external decorating member 20 itself has an improved stiffness because of the glass member 22 made of tempered glass and thus protects the refrigerator doors from being easily impaired by an external impact.<br>
While the present invention has been described and illustrated herein with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention that come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br>
