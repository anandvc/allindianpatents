				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
This invention relates to compounds that inhibit or modulate the activity of the heat shock protein Hsp90, to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease states or conditions mediated by Hsp90, and to novel compounds having Hsp90 inhibitory or modulating activity. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and novel chemical intermediates.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In response to cellular stresses including heat, toxins, radiation, infection, inflammation, and oxidants, all cells produce a common set of heat shock proteins (Hsps) (Macario &amp; de Macario 2000). Most heat shock proteins act as molecular chaperones. Chaperones bind and stabilize proteins at intermediate stages of folding and allow proteins to fold to their functional states. Hsp90 is the most abundant cytosolic Hsp under normal conditions. There are two human isoforms of Hsp90, a major form Hsp90a and minor form Hsp90p. Hsp90 binds proteins at a late stage of folding and is distinguished from other Hsps in that most of its protein substrates are involved in signal transduction. Hsp90 has a distinct ATP binding site, including a Bergerat fold characteristic of bacterial gyrase, topoisomerases and histidine kinases. It has been shown that ATP bound at the N-terminal pocket of Hsp90 is hydrolysed. This ATPase activity results in a conformational change in Hsp90 that is required to enable conformational changes in the client protein.<br>
A dimerization domain and a second ATP binding site, which may regulate ATPase activity, is found near the c-terminus of Hsp90. Dimerization of HSP90 appears critical for ATP hydrolysis. Activation of Hsp90 is further regulated through interactions with a variety of other chaperone proteins and can be isolated in complex with other chaperones including Hsp70, Hip, Hop, p23, and p50cdc37. Many other co-chaperone proteins have also been demonstrated to bind HSP90. A simplified model has emerged in which ATP binding to the amino terminal pocket alters Hsp90 conformation to allow association with a multichaperone complex. First the client protein is bound to an Hsp70/Hsp40 complex. This complex then associates with Hsp90 via Hop. When ADP is replaced by ATP, the conformation of Hsp90 is altered, Hop and Hsp70 are released and a different set of co-chaperones is recruited including p50cdc37 and p23. ATP hydrolysis results in the release of these co-chaperones and the client protein from the mature complex. Ansamycin antibiotics herbimycin, geldanamycin (GA) and 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) are ATP binding site inhibitors that block the binding of ATP and prevent conversion to the mature complex (Grenert et, al., 1997. J Biol Chem., 272:23834-23850).<br>
Despite Hsp90 being ubiquitously expressed, GA has a higher binding affinity for Hsp90 derived from tumour vs. normal cell lines (Kamal et. al., Nature 2003; 425: 407-410). GA also shows more potent cytotoxic activity in tumour cells and is sequestered at higher concentrations within tumours in xenograft mouse models (Brazidec J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 3865-3873). Furthermore the ATP-ase activity of<br><br>
Hsp90 is elevated in cancer cells and is an indication of the increased level of stress in these cells. Hsp90 gene amplification has also been reported to occur in the later stages of cancer (Jolly and Morimoto JNCI Vol. 92, No. 19, 1564-1572, 2000).<br>
Increased genetic instability associated with the cancer phenotype leads to an increase in the production of non-native or mutant proteins. The ubiquitin pathway also serves to protect the cell from non-native or misfolded proteins, by targeting these proteins for proteasomal degradation. Mutant proteins are by their nature not native and therefore have the potential to show structural instability and an increased requirement for the chaperone system. (Giannini et al., Mol Cell Biol. 2004; 24(13):5667-76).<br>
There is some evidence that Hsp90 is found primarily within "activated" multichaperone complexes in the tumour cells as opposed to "latent" complexes in normal cells. One component of the multichaperone complex is the cdc37 co-chaperone. Cdc37 binds Hsp90 at the base of the ATP binding site and could affect the off rates of inhibitors bound to Hsp90 in the "activated" state (Roe et. al, Cell 116, (2004), pp. 87-98). The client protein bound to the Hsp90-Hsp70 form of the chaperone complex is believed to be more susceptible to ubiquitination and targeting to the proteasome for degradation. E3 ubiquitin ligases have been identified with chaperone interacting motifs and one of these (CHIP) was shown to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (Connell et al, 2001. Xu et al, 2002).<br>
Hsp90 client proteins<br>
The number of reported Hsp90 client proteins now exceeds 100. Since many of its client proteins are involved in cell signalling proliferation and survival, Hsp90 has received major interest as an oncology target. Two groups of client proteins, cell signalling protein kinases and transcription factors, in particular suggest Hsp90 regulation may have potential benefit as an anticancer therapy.<br>
Hsp90 protein kinase client proteins implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following: c-Src<br>
Cellular Src (c-Src) is a receptor tyrosine kinase, required for mitogenesis initiated by multiple growth factor receptors, including the receptors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1R), and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGFR). C-Src is also overexpressed and activated in many of the same human carcinomas that overexpress EGFR and ErbB2. Src is also required for the maintenance of normal bone homeostasis through its regulation of osteoclast function.<br>
p185erbB2<br>
ErbB2 (Her2/neu) is a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of malignancies including breast, ovarian, prostate, and gastric cancers. ErbB2 was originally identified as an oncogene and inhibition of Hsp90 results in the polyubiquitination and degradation of erbB2.<br><br>
Polo mitotic kinase<br>
Polo-like kinases (Plks) are important regulators of cell cycle progression during M-phase. Plks are involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus and in the activation of CDK/cyclin complexes. Plkl regulates tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDKs through phosphorylation and activation of Cdc25C. CDK1 activation in turn leads to spindle formation and entry into M phase.<br>
Akt (PKB)<br>
Akt is involved in pathways that regulate cell growth by stimulating cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. Hsp90 inhibition by ansamycins results in a reduction in the Akt half life through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Binding of cdc37 to Hsp90 is also required for the down-regulation of Akt. Following ansamycin treatment cancer cells arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle 24 hours after treatment and proceed to apoptosis 24-48 hours later. Normal cells also arrest 24 hours after ansamycin treatment, but do not proceed on to apoptosis.<br>
c-Raf. B-RAF. Mek<br>
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in approximately 15% of human cancers^ The three RAF genes are serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS.<br>
EGFR<br>
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is implicated in cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis, and migration. Overexpression of EGFR has been found in many different cancers and activating mutations of its kinase domain appear to be pathogenic in a subset of adenocarcinoams of the lung.<br>
Flt3<br>
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Flt3 activation also leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAS signal-transduction cascades.<br>
c-Met<br>
c-met is a receptor tyrosine kinase which binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and regulates both cell motility and cell growth, c-met is overexpressed in tumours, including thyroid, stomach, pancreatic and colon cancer. HGF is also detected around the tumours, including liver metastases. This suggests that c-met and HGF play an important role in invasion and metastasis.<br>
Cdkl.Cdk2.Cdk4.Cdk6<br><br>
Cdkl, Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 drive the cell cycle. The activity of CDKs is regulated by their binding to specific subunits such as cyclins, inhibitory and assembly factors. The substrate specificity and timing of CDK activities is dictated by their interaction with specific cyclins. Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk6/cyclin D are active in the Gl phase, Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk2/cyclin A in S phase, and Cdc2/cyclin A and Cdc2/cyclin B in G2/M phase.<br>
Cyclin-dependent kinase type 4 (CDK4), plays a key role in allowing cells to traverse Gl to S-phase transition of the cell cycle and is constitutively activated in many human cancers. The CDK4 activator, cyclin Dl, is overexpressed and a CDK4 inhibitor, p16, is deleted in a variety of human tumours.<br>
Cdkl/Cdk2 inhibitors have been developed which reversibly block normal cells in either the Gl/S-phase or at the G2/M border. G2/M arrest is generally less well tolerated by the cells and consequently, they undergo apoptotic cell death. Since Hsp90 also is known to affect cell survival pathways this effect may be further amplified with an Hsp90 inhibitor.<br>
Wee-1<br>
The Wee-1 protein kinase carries out the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 on tyrosine 15 (Tyrl5). This is required for activation of the G2-phase checkpoint in response to DNA damage.<br>
Hsp90 transcription factors implicated in cell proliferation and survival include the following: Mutant p53<br>
P53 is a tumour suppressor protein that causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis. P53 is mutated in approximately half of all cancers. Mutant p53 associates with Hsp90 and is down-regulated in cancer lines treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, while wild type p53 levels were unaffected.<br>
Progesterone receptor/ Estrogen receptor/ Androgen receptor<br>
In the absence of hormones, Progesterone and androgen receptors are bound by Hsp90 in an inactive form. Upon binding with their cognate hormones, the receptors undergo conformational changes and dissociation from hsp90. The ligand bound receptors are then capable of dimerisation, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. The activated receptors then bind to hormone-response elements (HREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes involved in maintaining cell proliferation.<br>
Hif-la<br>
Hypoxia inducible factor-la (HIF-la) is a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes which play a role in angiogenesis. HIF-la is expressed in the majority of metastases and is known to associate with Hsp90. Ansamycin treatment of renal carcinoma cell lines leads to the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-la.<br><br>
Hsp90 inhibitors are capable of affecting a large number of targets significant to signal transduction in tumour cell proliferation. Signal transduction inhibitors which regulate the activities of a single target, may not be as efficacious due to signalling pathway redundancy and the rapid development of resistance.<br>
By regulating multiple targets involved in cell signalling and cell proliferation HSP90 inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of a wide spectrum of proliferative disorders.<br>
hERG<br>
In the late 1990s a number of drugs, approved by the US FDA, had to be withdrawn from sale in the US when it was discovered they were implicated in deaths caused by heart malfunction. It was subsequently found that a side effect of these drugs was the development of arrhythmias caused by the blocking of hERG channels in heart cells. The hERG channel is one of a family of potassium ion channels the first member of which was identified in the late 1980s in a mutant Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly (see Jan, L.Y. and Jan, Y.N. (1990). A Superfamily of Ion Channels. Nature, 345(6277):672). The biophysical properties of the hERG potassium ion channel are described in Sanguinetti, M.C., Jiang, C., Curran, M.E., and Keating, M.T. (1995). A Mechanistic Link Between an Inherited and an Acquired Cardiac Arrhythmia: HERG encodes the Ikr potassium channel. Cell, 81:299-307, and Trudeau, M.C., Warmke, J.W., Ganetzky, B., and Robertson, G.A. (1995). HERG, a Human Inward Rectifier in the Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel Family. Science, 269:92-95.<br>
The elimination of hERG blocking activity remains an important consideration in the development of any new drug.<br>

General Preferences and Definitions<br>
In this section, as in all other sections of this application, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to a compound of formula (I) includes all subgroups of formula (I) as defined herein, including formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VIa), (VII), (VIla) and (Vllb) and the term 'subgroups' includes all preferences, embodiments, examples and particular compounds defined herein.<br>
Moreover, a reference to a compound of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (Via), (VII), (Vila) or (Vllb) and sub-groups thereof includes ionic forms, salts, solvates, isomers, tautomers, N-oxides, esters, prodrugs, isotopes and protected forms thereof, as discussed below:- preferably, the salts or tautomers or isomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof:- and more preferably, the salts or tautomers or N-oxides or solvates thereof.<br>
The following general preferences and definitions shall apply to each of R1 to R8, R10, Ra, Rb, RC, X1 and X2 and their various sub-groups, sub-definitions, examples and embodiments unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
Any references to formula (1) herein shall also be taken to refer to and any sub-group of compounds within formula (I) and any preferences and examples thereof unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
References to "carbocyclic" and "heterocyclic" groups as used herein shall, unless the context indicates otherwise, include both aromatic and non-aromatic ring systems. Thus, for example, the term "carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups" includes within its scope aromatic, non-aromatic, unsaturated, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. In general, such groups may be monocyclic or bicyclic and may contain, for example, 3 to 12 ring members, more usually 5 to 10 ring members. Examples of monocyclic groups are groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 ring members,<br><br>
more usually 3 to 7, for example 5 to 7, and preferably 5 or 6 ring members.   Examples of bicyclic groups are those containing 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 ring members, and more usually 9 or 10 ring members.<br>
The term "bicyclic" as used herein refers to groups that have two rings joined together in such as way that at least one ring member is shared by both rings. Thus, the bicyciic group can be a fused ring (two ring members shared by both rings), spirocyclic (one ring member shared by both rings) or a bridged ring (three or more ring members shared by both rings).<br>
The carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups can be aryl or heteroaryl groups having from 5 to 12 ring members, more usually from 5 to 10 ring members. The term "aryl" as used herein refers to a carbocyclic group having aromatic character and the term "heteroaryl" is used herein to denote a heterocyclic group having aromatic character. The terms "aryl" and "heteroaryl" embrace polycyclic (e.g. bicyclic) ring systems wherein one or more rings are non-aromatic, provided that at least one ring is aromatic. In such polycyclic systems, the group may be attached by the aromatic ring, or by a non-aromatic ring. The aryl or heteroaryl groups can be monocyclic or bicyclic groups and can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents, for example one or more groups R10 as defined herein.<br>
The term "non-aromatic group" embraces unsaturated ring systems without aromatic character, partially saturated and fully saturated carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring systems. The terms "unsaturated" and "partially saturated" refer to rings wherein the ring structure(s) contains atoms sharing more than one valence bond i.e. the ring contains at least one multiple bond e.g. a C=C, C=C or N=C bond. The terms "fully saturated" and "saturated" refer to rings where there are no multiple bonds between ring atoms. Saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkyl groups as defined below. Partially saturated carbocyclic groups include cycloalkenyl groups as defined below, for example cyclopentenyl, cycloheptenyl and cyclooctenyl. A further example of a cycloalkenyl group is cyclohexenyl.<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a five membered or six membered monocyclic ring or a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings or, by way of a further example, two fused five membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen. Typically the heteroary! ring will contain up to 4 heteroatoms, more typically up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five.<br><br>
Examples of five membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, furazan, oxazole, oxadiazole, oxatriazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, pyrazole, triazole and tetrazole groups.<br>

Further examples of non-aromatic cyclic groups include bridged ring systems such as bicycloalkanes and azabicycloalkanes although such bridged ring systems are generally less preferred. By "bridged ring systems" is meant ring systems in which two rings share more than two atoms, see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4lh Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages 131-133, 1992. Examples of bridged ring systems include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, aza-<br><br>

Where reference is made herein to carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups, the carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring can, unless the context indicates otherwise, be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituent groups R10 selected from halogen, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-C|.4 hydrocarbylamino, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members; a group Ra-Rb wherein Ra is a bond, O, CO, X'C(X2), C(X2)X!, X'C(X2)X', S, SO, SO2, NRC, SO2NRC or NRCSO2; and Rb is selected from hydrogen, carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members, and a C1-12 hydrocarbyl group (such as a C1-10 hydrocarbyl group) optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from hydroxy, oxo, halogen, cyano, nitro, carboxy, amino, mono- or di-C1-8 non-aromatic hydrocarbylamino (e.g. mono- or di-C1-4 hydrocarbylamino), carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups having from 3 to 12 ring members and wherein one or more carbon atoms of the C1-12 hydrocarbyl group (or C1-10 hydrocarbyl group) may optionally be replaced by O, S, SO, SO2, NRC, X'C(X2), C(X2)X' or X'C(X2)X';<br>
Rc is selected from Rb, hydrogen and CM hydrocarbyl; and<br>
X1 is O, S or NRC and X2 is =O, =S or =NRC.<br>
Where the substituent group R10 comprises or includes a carbocyclic or heterocyclic group, the said carbocyclic or heterocyclic group may be unsubstituted or may itself be substituted with one or more further substituent groups R10. In one sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), such further substituent groups R10 may include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups, which are typically not themselves further substituted. In another sub-group of compounds of the formula (I), the said further substituents do not include carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups but are otherwise selected from the groups listed above in the definition of R10.<br>
The substituents R10 may be selected such that they contain no more than 20 non-hydrogen atoms, for example, no more than 15 non-hydrogen atoms, e.g. no more than 12, or 11, or 10, or 9, or 8, or 7, or 6, or 5 non-hydrogen atoms.<br>
Where the carbocyclic and heterocyclic groups have a pair of substituents on the same or adjacent ring atoms, the two substituents may be linked so as to form a cyclic group. Thus, two adjacent groups R10, together with the carbon atoms or heteroatoms to which they are attached may form a 5-membered heteroaryl ring or a 5- or 6-membered non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, wherein the said heteroaryl and heterocyclic groups contain up to 3 heteroatom ring members selected from N, O and S. For example, an adjacent pair of substituents on adjacent carbon atoms of a ring may be linked via one or more heteroatoms and optionally substituted alkylene groups to form a fused oxa-, dioxa-, aza-, diaza- or oxa-aza-cycloalkyl group.<br>
Examples of such linked substituent groups include:<br><br><br>

All such salts are within the scope of this invention, and references to compounds of the formula (I) include the salt forms of the compounds.<br>
The salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic<br><br>
solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.<br>
Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(1S)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane- 1,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), a-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, (+)-L-lactic, (±)-DL-lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, (-)-L-malic, malonic, (±)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, naphthalene-2-sulphonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulphonic, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, (+)-L-tartaric, thiocyanic,p-toluenesulphonic, undecylenic and valeric acids, as well as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins.<br>
If the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as A13+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4+) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR4+). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+.<br>
Where the compounds of the formula (I) contain an amine function, these may form quaternary ammonium salts, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent according to methods well known to the skilled person. Such quaternary ammonium compounds are within the scope of formula (I).<br>
7'he salt forms of the compounds of the invention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula (I) containing an amine function may also form N-oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula (!) that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide.<br>
Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.<br>
N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) may exist in a number of different geometric isomeric, and tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula (I) include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several geometric isomeric or tautomeric forms and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula (I).<br>
Examples of tautomeric forms include, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example,<br>
the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol,<br>
amidine/amidine,	nitroso/oxime,	thioketone/enethiol,	and	nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) contain one or more chiral centres, and can exist in the form of two or more optical isomers, references to compounds of the formula (I) include all optical isomeric forms thereof (e.g. enantiomers, epimers and diastereoisomers), either as individual optical isomers, or mixtures (e.g. racemic mixtures) or two or more optical isomers, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
The optical isomers may be characterised and identified by their optical activity (i.e. as + and - isomers, or d and / isomers) or they may be characterised in terms of their absolute stereochemistry using the "R and S" nomenclature developed by Cahn, Ingold and Prelog, see Advanced Organic Chemistry by Jerry March, 4lh Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pages 109-114, and see also Cahn, Ingold &amp; Prelog, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1966, 5, 385-415.<br>
Optical isomers can be separated by a number of techniques including chiral chromatography (chromatography on a chiral support) and such techniques are well known to the person skilled in the art.<br><br>
As an alternative to chiral chromatography, optical isomers can be separated by forming diastereoisomeric salts with chiral acids such as (+)-tartaric acid, (-)-pyroglutamic acid, (-)-di-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid, (+)-mandelic acid, (-)-malic acid, and (-)-camphorsulphonic, separating the diastereoisomers by preferential crystallisation, and then dissociating the salts to give the individual enantiomer of the free base.<br>
Where compounds of the formula (I) exist as two or more optical isomeric forms, one enantiomer in a pair of enantiomers may exhibit advantages over the other enantiomer, for example, in terms of biological activity. Thus, in certain circumstances, it may be desirable to use as a therapeutic agent only one of a pair of enantiomers, or only one of a plurality of diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the invention provides compositions containing a compound of the formula (I) having one or more chiral centres, wherein at least 55% (e.g. at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95%) of the compound of the formula (I) is present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer). In one general embodiment, 99% or more (e.g. substantially all) of the total amount of the compound of the formula (I) may be present as a single optical isomer (e.g. enantiomer or diastereoisomer).<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds with one or more isotopic substitutions, and a reference to a particular element includes within its scope all isotopes of the element. For example, a reference to hydrogen includes within its scope ]H, 2H (D), and 3H (T). Similarly, references to carbon and oxygen include within their scope respectively I2C, 13C and 14C and 16O and 18O.<br>
The isotopes may be radioactive or non-radioactive. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds contain no radioactive isotopes. Such compounds are preferred for therapeutic use. In another embodiment, however, the compound may contain one or more radioisotopes. Compounds containing such radioisotopes may be useful in a diagnostic context.<br>
Esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters of the compounds of formula (I) bearing a carboxylic acid group or a hydroxyl group are also embraced by Formula (I). Examples of esters are compounds containing the group -C(=O)OR, wherein R is an ester substituent, for example, a C1-7 alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5-20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7alkyl group. Particular examples of ester groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=O)OCH3, -C(=O)OCH2CH3, -C(=O)OC(CH3)3, and -C(=O)OPh. Examples of acyloxy (reverse ester) groups are represented by -OC(=O)R, wherein R is an acyloxy substituent, for example, a C1-7 alkyl group, a C3.20 heterocyclyl group, or a C5.20 aryl group, preferably a C1-7 alkyl group. Particular examples of acyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, -OC(=0)CH3 (acetoxy), -OC(=O)CH2CH3, -OC(=O)C(CH3)3, -OC(=O)Ph, and -OC(=O)CH2Ph.<br>
In one general embodiment, formula (I) and sub-formulae, sub-groups, preferences and examples thereof do not cover esters such as carboxylic acid esters and acyloxy esters.<br><br>
In one particular embodiment, formula (I) and sub-formulae, sub-groups, preferences and examples thereof do not cover esters of hydroxy compounds wherein R2 is hydroxy and the ester is formed with the hydroxy group R2.<br>
Also encompassed by formula (I) are any polymorphic forms of the compounds, solvates (e.g. hydrates), complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds, and pro-drugs of the compounds. By "prodrugs" is meant for example any compound that is converted in vivo into a biologically active compound of the formula (I).<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g., a physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During metabolism, the ester group (-C(=O)OR) is cleaved to yield the active drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=O)OH) in the parent compound, with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive groups present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those of the formula -C(=O)OR wherein R is:<br>
C1-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., -Me, -Et, -nPr, -iPr, -nBu, -sBu, -iBu, -tBu);<br>
C1-7aminoalkyl<br>
(e.g., aminoethyl; 2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino)ethyl); and<br>
acyloxy-C1-7alkyl<br>
(e.g., acyloxymethyl;<br>
acyloxyethyl;<br>
pivaloyloxymethyl;<br>
acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxy ethyl;<br>
1 -(1 -methoxy-1 -methy l)ethy 1-carbonxy loxyethy 1;<br>
l-(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1 -isopropoxy-carbonyloxyethyl; cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-cyclohexyl-carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
1-cyclohexyloxy-carbony loxyethy 1;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl;<br>
l-(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxymethyl; and<br>
l-(4-tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields the active compound (for example, as in ADEPT, GDEPT,<br><br>
DEPT , etc.). For example, the prodrug may be a sugar derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester derivative.<br>
Biological Activity<br>
The compounds of the formulae (I) and sub-groups thereof are inhibitors of Hsp90 and consequently are expected to be beneficial in the treatment of wide spectrum of proliferative disorders. Examples of such proliferative disorders include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, epidermis, liver, lung, for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, oesophagus, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, stomach, cervix, thyroid, prostate, gastrointestinal system, e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumours, or skin, for example squamous cell carcinoma; a hematopoieitic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma), T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoieitic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example acute chronic myelogenous leukaemias, Imatinib sensitive and refractory chronic myelogenous leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, Bortezomib sensitive and refractory multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disease or promyelocytic leukaemia; thyroid follicular cancer; a tumour of mesenchymal origin, for example fibrosarcoma or habdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoacanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.<br>
The cancers may be cancers which are sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, and such cancers may be determined by a method as set out in the section headed "Methods of Diagnosis".<br>
One group of cancers includes human breast cancers (e.g. primary breast tumours, node-negative breast cancer, invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast, non-endometrioid breast cancers); and mantle cell lymphomas. In addition, other cancers are colorectal and endometrial cancers.<br>
Another sub-set of cancers includes hematopoietic tumours of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell lymphoma (such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma) and optionally further includes chronic myelogenous leukaemia and multiple myeloma.<br>
A preferred sub-set of cancers consists of ErbB2-positive breast, prostate, lung, and gastric cancer; chronic myeloid leukemia; androgen receptor dependent prostate cancer; FIt3-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia; melanoma associated with Braf mutation; multiple myeloma; velcade refractory multiple myeloma; and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST).<br>
Of these, particularly preferred cancers are multiple myleomas and velcade refractory tumour types as defined herein.<br><br>
sp90 inhibitors could also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, parasitic disease, autoimmune diseases, neuro-degenerative disorders, inflammation, Type I and II diabetes, and cardiac disease.<br>
Hsp90 inhibitors could also have clinical benefit in transplantation and immunosuppression.<br>
Hsp90 inhibitors may also have clinical benefit in the previously described diseases when used in combination with existing or new therapeutic agents.<br>
Based on the activities of Hsp90 client proteins and experimental evidence, the following disorders may be particularly sensitive to treatment by Hsp90 inhibitors.<br>
ErbB2-positive breast, prostate, lung, and gastric cancer<br>
Overexpression of ErbB2 (HER-2) occurs in approximately 30 % of breast cancers and ErbB2 receptor down-regulation by herceptin sensitized cells to Taxol. ErbB2 over-expression is linked to poor prognosis and drug resistance (Tsugawa et. al., 1993. Oncology 1993; 50: 418).<br>
Mutant EGFR in lung cancer<br>
Somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including L858R and exon 19 deletions, underlie responsiveness to gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Acquired resistance to these tyrosine kinase inhibitors is in some cases mediated by a second mutation, T790M. Ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin, potently inhibit heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), promoting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of oncogenic kinases that require the chaperone for proper conformational folding. Exposure of EGFR-mutant cell lines to geldanamycin induced marked depletion of phospho-Akt and cyclin Dl as well as apoptosis. These data suggest mutational activation of EGFR is associated with dependence on Hsp90 for stability and that Hsp90 inhibition may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC.<br>
Chronic myeloid Leukemia<br>
The aberrant BCR-Abl protein is created through a chromosomal translocation and results in a constitutively active Abl kinase domain. This translocation event has been shown to be causal for CML. P210BcrAbl is a known client protein for Hsp90. Treatment of the BCR-Abl cell line K562 with an hsp90 inhibitor induced apoptosis. The Bcr-Abl inhibitor Gleevec® also induces apoptosis in K562 cells; however Gleevec® resistant K562 cells still retain sensitivity towards Hsp90 inhibitors (Gorre et. al. 2002, Blood 100:3041-3044).<br>
Androgen receptor dependent prostate cancer<br>
The androgen receptor kinase is an Hsp90 client protein. Hormone replacement therapy is usually adopted where surgery does not resolve the cancer. Eventually through mutation in the receptor the<br><br>
cancer becomes refractory to the hormone analogue.   Hsp90 regulation of the receptor would still be viable post-mutation.<br>
The same would apply to estrogen-dependent breast cancers. FItS-dependent acute myeloid leukaemia<br>
Internal duplication of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 leads to its constitutive activation and oncogenesis. These internal duplications are observed in 20% of all reported cases of AML and are an indication of poor prognosis. Much like the activation of the ABL kinase in CML, this represents another example of a single genetic lesion giving rise to a malignancy. Hsp90 inhibitors are predicted to be of clinical benefit to these patients as Flt3 is an Hsp90 client protein (Bali et. al., 2004 Cancer Res. 64(10):3645-52).<br>
Melanoma associated with Braf mutation<br>
Braf encodes for a serine/threonine kinase which is mutated in 70% of all melanomas. 80% of these represent a single V599E point mutation that confers elevated kinase activity to BRAF. This mutation is also transforming in NIH3T3 cells (Bignell et. al., 2002 Nature. 417(6892):949-54).<br>
Multiple Myeloma<br>
The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG potently inhibits proliferation of Bortezomib refractory multiple myeloma cell lines. Cell surface levels of IGF-1R and IL-6R were also diminished in 17-aag treated MM-1 cells (Mitsiades et. al., Blood 107:1092-1100, 2006). Autocrine stimulation of multiple myeloma cells, as well as paracrine stimulation of bone marrow stromal cells with IL-6 is also diminished through downregulation of the Hsp90 client IKK.<br>
Velcade Refractory Multiple Myeloma<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be used in the treatment of velcade refractory tumour types including treatment of patients with second line mantle cell lymphoma, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage IIIB and IV Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br>
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)<br>
GIST disease particularly disease dependent on growth factor activation or overexpression (e.g. c-kit)<br>
Other conditions or disorders for which an Hsp90 inhibitor may be of clinical benefit include, but are not limited to:<br>
Neurodegenerative disorders<br>
Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. GA inhibition of Hsp90 and the resulting up-regulation of Hsps are effective in preventing huntington protein<br><br>
agregation in neuronal cells. (Sittler et. al, 2001, Human Molecular Genetics, Vol. 10, No. 12 1307-1315). Up-regulation of HSP may also be of clinical benefit in other diseases of protein misfolding e.g., CJD and Alzheimer's.<br>
Inflammatory disease, including Rheumatoid arthritis. Asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. and inflammatory bowel disease<br>
GA has been shown to dissociate HSF-1 from Hsp90 leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of HSF-1. HSF-1 subsequently acts as a transcription factor to induce HSP90 and Hsp70. The induction of Hsp70 has been implicated in the resolution of inflammation in an induced mouse model of edema (lanaro et al., 2004 Human Molecular Genetics, 2001, Vol. 10, No. 12 1307-1315). Additionally GA treatment inhibited IkappaB kinase (IKK) activation by TNF-a or PMA. IkBa is a regulator of Nf-kB and Ap-1. (Broemer et. al. 2004 ). Ap-1 and Nf-kB is a major transcription factor leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Yeo et. al., 2004 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 30; 320(3):816-24). The stability of pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts is also regulated through inhibition of p38 MapK (Wax et. al., 2003. Rheumatism Vol. 48, No. 2, pp 541-550).<br>
Angiogenesis related disease, including but not limited to: tumour angiogenesis. psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy<br>
Induction of angiogenesis is regulated by Hsp90 client proteins eNOS and Akt in endothelial cells (Sun and Liao, 2004 Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol. 24(12):2238-44). Suppression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-la can also impair the growth, angiogenesis and vessel maturation of gastric tumours in a mouse model. (Stoeltzing et. al., 2004 J Natl Cancer Inst; 96:946-956.).<br>
Type I and type II diabetes<br>
Hsp90 inhibition has a profound effect on Akt signalling as well as e-nos. These are two key regulators in high glucose induced endothelial cell apoptosis in type I diabetes (Lin et. al., 2005 J Cell Biochem. 1; 94(1): 194-201) and the development of hypertension in type II diabetes (Kobayashi et. al., 2004 Hypertension. 44(6):956-62.).<br>
Immunosuppression and transplantation<br>
Hsp90 inhibition has been shown to down regulate Lck, a T-cell specific tyrosine kinase required for T-cell activation. (Yorgin et. al., 2000 J Immunoi. 15; 164(6):2915-23.)<br>
Cardiac disease<br>
Cardiac ischemic is the most common cause of death in the western world. Hsps, and notably Hsp70 (induced by radicicol treatment) have demonstrated cardioprotective activity in rat cardiomyocytes (Griffin et. al., 2004). Inhibition of Hsp90 results in the release of HSF-1 from the chaperone complex<br><br>
And its subsequent activation of Hsp genes.   Inhibition of Hsp90 also leads to the down-regulation of HIF-1, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease and stroke.<br>
Infectious disease<br>
Hepatits C viral NS2/3 protease is an Hsp90 client protein and Hsp90 activity is required for viral processing and replication (Whitney et. al., 2001. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 20;98(24): 13931-5.).<br>
Parasitic disease<br>
GA has reported antimalarial activity against an Hsp90 ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium growth was inhibited with GA at an IC50 similar to that observed with chloroquine. GA was also effective against chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum (Kamar et. al., 2003 . Malar J.15;2(l):30).<br>
The biological activity of the compounds of the invention, e.g. as inhibitors of Hsp90, can be measured using the assays set forth in the examples below, for example the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments described in Example 80 and the anti-proliferative activity assays described in Example 81. The level of activity exhibited by a given compound in the ITC assay can be defined in terms of the Kd value, and preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having a Kdvalue of less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 0.1 micromolar. In the anti-proliferative activity assays, the level of activity exhibited by a given compound in an assay can be defined in terms of the lC50 value, and preferred compounds of the present invention are compounds having an IC50 value of less than 1 micromolar, more preferably less than 0.1 micromolar.<br>
It has also been found that many compounds of the formula (I) have low hERG activity and a good separation between Hsp90 inhibitory activity and hERG activity.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula (I) have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 30 times, or greater than 40 times, or greater than 50 times the IC50 values of the compounds in cellular proliferation assays. Preferred compounds of the formula (I) have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 5 µM, more particularly greater than 10µM, and more preferably greater than 15 µM. Some compounds of the invention have mean IC50 values against hERG that are greater than 50 µM.<br>
Compounds of the invention have advantageous ADME properties and in particular better tumour distribution.<br>
Methods for the Preparation of Compounds of the Formula (I)<br>
In this section, as in all other sections of this application unless the context indicates otherwise, references to Formula (I) also include all sub-groups and examples therof as defined herein. Where a reference is made to a group R1, R2, R3, R4,R5, R6, R10 or any other "R" group, the definition of the group<br><br>
question is as set out above and as set out in the following sections of this application unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared in accordance with synthetic methods well known to the skilled person. For example, compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula (X):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or an activated and/or protected form thereof, with an amine of the formula HNR5R6 under conditions suitable for forming an amide bond, and thereafter where necessary removing any protecting groups and optionally converting one compound of the formula (I) to another compound of the formula (I).<br>
The amines of the formula HNR5R6 are either commercially available or can be made using methods well known to the skilled person, see for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8).<br>
The carboxylic acid (X) can be converted to an amide of the formula (I) by first forming an acid chloride by treatment of the carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride, or by reaction with oxalyl chloride in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethyl formamide, or by reaction of a potassium salt of the acid with oxalyl chloride. The acid chloride can then be reacted with the amine HNR5R6 in the presence of a non-interfering base such as triethylamine. The reaction may be carried out at around room temperature in a polar solvent such as dioxan.<br>
As an alternative to using the acid chloride method described above, the carboxylic acid (X) can be converted to the amide (I) by reaction with the amine HNR5R6 in the presence of amide coupling reagents of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages. Examples of such reagents include 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Sheehan et al, J. Amer. Chem Soc. 1955, 77, 1067), l-ethyl-3-(3(-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (referred to herein either as EDC or EDAC but also known in the art as EDCI and WSCDI) (Sheehan et al, J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 2525), uronium-based coupling agents such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N,N,'-tetrainethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and phosphonium-based coupling agents such as l-benzo-triazolyloxytris-(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) (Castro et al, Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31 205). Carbodiimide-based coupling agents are advantageously used in combination with l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) (L. A. Carpino, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115. 4397) or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (Konig et al,<br><br>
Chem. Ber., 103, 708, 2024-2034).   Preferred coupling reagents include EDC (EDAC) and DCC in combination with HOAt or HOBt.<br>
The coupling reaction is typically carried out in a non-aqueous, non-protic solvent such as acetonitrile, dioxan, dimethylsulphoxide, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidine, or in an aqueous solvent optionally together with one or more miscible co-solvents. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature or, where the reactants are less reactive (for example in the case of electron-poor anilines bearing electron withdrawing groups such as sulphonamide groups) at an appropriately elevated temperature. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a non-interfering base, for example a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine.<br>
Illustrative routes to the compounds of formula (I) are described in more detail below.<br>
Compounds of the formula (1) in which the benzoyl moiety is derived from a 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acid can be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown in Scheme 1.<br>
The starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 is 5-chloro-2-hydroxy benzoic acid, which can be obtained commercially. Conversion to the acid chloride is carried out by heating with thionyl chloride. The acid chloride may be used either in situ and reacted with various amines, or can be isolated as a stable white solid. Other simple 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids may be used in this procedure to synthesise other amides of 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids.<br><br><br><br>

Scheme 1: 5-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzoic acid amides<br>
Compounds of formula (1) can also be made according to the method shown in Scheme 2. The starting material for the synthetic route shown in Scheme 2 is 4-ethyl anisole, which can be obtained commercially. Conversion to the carboxylic acid can be carried out by lithiation at low temperature, followed by quenching of the resulting anion with solid carbon dioxide. The carboxylic acid may be<br><br>
coupled with various amines, using standard amide coupling reagents of the type commonly used in the formation of peptide linkages as described above.<br>
Deprotection of the methyl ether can be effected using using boron tribromide (e.g. by the method described in Synthesis 1991, 469) to give the compound of formula (I). The method illustrated in Scheme 2 can be used to prepare other simple 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids which can then be coupled to an appropriate amine to give the compounds of formula (I). The process of coupling intermediates acids with amines, anilines or amino-heterocyclic compounds, followed by removal of any protecting groups, is straightforward and is suitable for the synthesis of large combinatorial libraries of molecules, useful for this invention. Examples of combinatorial libraries are described in Solid-Phase Synthesis and Combinatorial Technologies by Pierfausto Seneci. Wiley-Interscience, New York. 2000. xii + 637 pp. ISBN 0471331953).<br><br>

Scheme 2<br>
Compounds of the Formula (I) can also be made according to the methods desribed in Scheme 3. The starting material 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (X = tert-butyl) is commercially available and can be coupled using the amide coupling agents (as outlined above) with a broad range of amines of the formula HNR5R6 to give compounds of the invention. The other starting material illustrated in Scheme 3, 3-isopropyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (X = isopropyl), can be prepared according to a modification of a literature procedure using carbon tetrachloride and copper powder in a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, in which the intermediate species is hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid (J Chem Soc, Chem Commun 1985, 1134). The Friedel Crafts method can be used to prepare other simple 2-hydroxy-3-substituted benzoic acids.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 3: 3-Alkyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid amides<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the method described in Scheme 4. 2,4-<br>
Dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-benzoic acid amides can be prepared by amide coupling using coupling reagents<br>
(as outlined above) from a bi-benzyl ether protected intermediate, shown in the scheme, followed by<br>
catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon. The benzoic acid intermediate<br>
itself is made by Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (from commercial<br>
sources) using a literature procedure (J. Ind. Chem. Soc.,  1953, 30. 269). Typically, Friedel-Crafts<br>
acylation of a phenol is carried out by treatment of the phenol with an acylating agent (such as an acid<br>
chloride or acid anhydride) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (such as boron trifluoride or<br>
aluminium chloride) either at room temperature or at more elevated temperatures (60-120 °C). Benzyl<br>
protection of the phenol groups, the Wittig reaction of the ketone to the olefin and ester hydrolysis<br>
(saponification) can be carried out under standard conditions, well known to those skilled in the art of<br>
organic synthesis (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley<br>
Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by<br>
Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by<br>
Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8). For example, the Wittig reaction can be carried out in an<br>
inert polar solvent (such as tetrahydrofuran) and can involve treatment of an aldehyde or ketone with a<br>
phosphorus ylide species that may be prepared by the reaction of a phosphonium salt with a base (such as<br>
butyl lithium or potassium tert-butoxide). The ester hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid is usually carried<br>
out by treatment with an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide such sodium hydroxide.   The saponification<br><br>
reaction may be carried out using an organic co-solvent such as an alcohol (e.g. methanol) and the reaction mixture is typically heated to a non-extreme temperature, for example up to about 50-60 °C.<br>
It is to be understood that other 2,4-dihydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula 1 not specifically exemplified herein.<br>
In Scheme 4, as an alternative to the use of the Wittig reagent MePPH3Br to form the olefin (XXVI), the ketone (XXV) can be reacted with methyl magnesium bromide under standard Grignard reaction conditions to give an intermediate hydroxy compound which is then dehydrated to the olefin by reaction with a suitable reagent such as sodium acetate and acetic acid.<br>
The intermediate compound 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid (XXVII) and its precursor compounds (XXV) and (XXVI) shown in Scheme 4 are believed to be novel and, as such, each of the compounds represents a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid amides (XXVIII) are also believed to be novel and also form a further aspect of the invention.<br><br><br>

Scheme 4: 2,4-Dihydroxy-5-isopropyl-benzoic acid amides<br><br>
The intermediate compound 2,4-bis-benzyloxy-5-isopropenyl-benzoic acid (XXVII) in Scheme 4 can be made using a variety of methods well known to the skilled person. For example, compound (XXVII) can be made by the synthetic route illustrated in Scheme 4A.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 4A<br>
As shown in Scheme 4A, 5-bromo-2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid is benzylated using benzyl bromide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate to give the bis-benzyloxy-bromobenzoic acid benzyl ester (XXX). The ester (XXX) is then reacted with potassium isoprenyl trifluoroborate in the presence of a palladium (0) or palladium (II) compound and a base to give the isopropenyl-bis benzyl ester (XXXI). The palladium compound can be a palladium (0) compound such as Pd(PPli3)4 or a palladium (II) compound such as [l,r-bis(diphenyl-phosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II). The base can be an organic base such as n-butylamine or an inorganic base such as a metal carbonate, e.g. caesium carbonate. The reaction with potassium isoprenyl trifluoroborate is typically carried out at reflux temperature for a prolonged period, for example 15 hours or more. The resulting isopropenyl bis-benzyloxy ester (XXXI) is then hydrolysed to give the carboxylic acid (XXVII) using, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide, typically with heating to a non-extreme temperature..<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the route illustrated in Scheme 5. 4-Hydroxy-3-(r,2'-dimethyl-propyl)-benzoic acid amides can be prepared by amide coupling using standard coupling agents (as outlined above) from the alkyl substituted acid. The olefmic acid itself can be prepared by Claisen rearrangement of a precursor ether, as shown in the scheme, by thermal rearrangement in anisole, followed by saponification, which in this case can yield more than one isomer of the olefin, the major one being shown in the scheme. Such Claisen reactions are well known in the<br><br>
Jiterature, e.g. see J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans 1 1981, 897. The ether itself can be prepared by simple alkylation of commercially available 4-hydroxy benzoic acid ethyl ester. The alkylation and saponification reactions are simple modifications that can be carried out under various conditions (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8)). It is to be understood that other 4-hydroxy-3-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula 1 not specifically exemplified herein.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 5: 4-Hydroxy-3-(l',2'-dimethyl-propyI)-benzoic acid amides<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be made according to the method shown in Scheme 6. 2,4-Dihydroxy-5-bromobenzoic acid is used as the starting material, which is commercially available. Simple protection and deprotection gives the benzoic acid precursor (for example see, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4lh edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8)),<br><br>
which can be used in amide coupling reactions with a range of amines (as outlined above). These precursor amides can be subjected to Suzuki cross coupling procedures to make alkyl substituted compounds. A broad range of Suzuki coupling conditions are described in the literature, and the ones used here were taken from J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 11148. Suzuki coupling chemistry is also broadly applicable to synthesis of alkyl-aryl and aryl-aryl compounds. The Suzuki reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as bis(tri-t-butylphosphine)-palladium and a base (e.g. a carbonate such as potassium carbonate). The reaction may be carried out in an aqueous solvent system, for example aqueous ethanol, and the reaction mixture is typically subjected to heating, for example to a temperature in excess of 100 °C. Many boronates suitable for use in preparing compounds of the invention are commercially available, for example from Boron Molecular Limited of Noble Park, Australia, or from Combi-Blocks Inc, of San Diego, USA. Where the boronates are not commercially available, they can be prepared by methods known in the art, for example as described in the review article by N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki, Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457. Thus, boronates can be prepared by reacting the corresponding bromo-compound with an alkyl lithium such as butyl lithium and then reacting with a borate ester. The resulting boronate ester derivative can, if desired, be hydrolysed to give the corresponding boronic acid. The final products of the reaction sequence illustrated in Scheme 6 are formed by catalytic hydrogenation (as outlined above) to remove the benzyl protecting groups and to reduce the olefm, formed in the Suzuki reaction to the alkyl substituent. It is to be understood that other 2,4-dihydroxy-5-substituted benzoic acids could be made using this procedure to synthesise different examples of compounds of formula 1 not specifically exemplified herein.<br><br>

Scheme 6: 2,4-Dihydroxy-5-(alkyl)-benzoic acid amides<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) wherein NR5R6 is an optionally substituted isoindoline group, for example as in compounds of the formulae (VII) and (VIla), can be prepared by the methods illustrated in Scheme 7, or methods analogous thereto.<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 7<br>
As shown in Scheme 7, an optionally substituted 1,2-dimethylbenzene (XI) is heated with N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of dibenzoyl peroxide to give the dibromo-compound (XII). The reaction is typically carried out in carbon tetrachloride with heating at reflux. The dibromo-compound (XII) is then reacted with a compound PG-NH2 where PG is a protecting group such as tosyl or para-methoxybenzyl in the presence of a base such as a metal hydride (e.g. sodium hydride), when PG is a tosyl group, or an alkali metal carbonate (e.g. sodium carbonate), when PG is para-methoxybenzyl. The protecting group PG can then be removed to give the amine (XIV). Thus, for example, a tosyl group can be removed by heating with a mxture of phenol, hydrobromic acid and propanoic acid, whereas apara-methoxybenzyl group can be removed in standard manner using trifluoroacetic acid and anisole. The amine (XIV) is then coupled with a carboxylic acid of the formula (X) as desribed above.<br>
In a variation on the reaction sequence of Scheme 7, one or more functional groups Rlob present in the protected isoindoline (XIII) or the deprotected isoindoline compound (XIV) can be converted into other groups Rlob. For example, where the group Rlob in compound (XIV) is a nitro group, it can be reduced to give the corresponding amino group, for example by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium on charcoal catalyst. In a further example, when Rlob in the compound (XIII) is an ester group (e.g. CO2Me), it can be hydrolysed to give a carboxylic acid which can then be reacted with an amine such as morpholine to give the corresponding amide. Further functional group interconversions may subsequently be carried out (for example reduction of the amide to the correspoding aminomethyl compound with lithium aluminium hydride) before removal of the protecting group PG.<br>
An alternative synthesis of the isoindoline compound (XIV) is shown in Scheme 8.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 8<br><br>
The starting material for Scheme 8 is the ortho diester (XV) which is hydrolysed to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid (XVI) using an alkali metal hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide before being subjected to cyclisation to the phthalic anhydride (XVII) by reaction with acetic anhydride. The phthalic anhydride (XVII) can be converted to the corresponding phthalimide (XVIII) by reaction with formamide at an elevated temperature (e.g. approximately 210 °C). The phthalimide (XVIII) can then be reduced to the isoindoline (XIV) using a suitable reducing agent such as borane in tetrahydrofuran.<br><br>
Compounds of the formula (Vllb) as defined herein can be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula (XIX) or a protected derivative thereof with a compound of the formula (XX):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein n, R3, R4a, R8 and R10cc are as defined herein, under amide forming conditions as described above and in the examples.<br>
Many of the compounds of formula (XX) are novel and, as such, form another aspect of the invention. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a compound of the formula (XX) but excluding any and all compounds known per se in the prior art.<br>
Within formula (XX), particular intermediates of the invention can be represented by the formula (XXI):<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein n is 0 or 1; M is N or CHOH and R25 is hydrogen or methyl; provided that when n is 0 and R25 is methyl, then M is CHOH.<br>
Particular intermediates within formula (XXI) are the compounds (XXII), (XXIII) and (XXIV) below.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The intermediates of formula (XXI) can be made by methods well known to the skilled person or methods analogous thereto. For example, intermediate XXII can be prepared by lithium-halogen exchange of a suitably N-protected 5-bromoisoindoline, quenching with l-methyl-4-piperidone and subsequent deprotection. Intermediate XXII can be prepared by Buchwald palladium coupling of 4-BOC-piperazine and a suitably N-protected 5-bromoisoindoline followed by subsequent deprotection. One method of preparation for intermediate XXIV is from a suitably N-protected isoindoline-5-carboxylic acid, Weinreb amide formation, reduction to the aldehyde, followed by reductive amination and subsequent deprotection.<br>
Once formed, where the substituent groups permit, one compound of the formula (I), or a protected form thereof, can be converted into another compound of the formula (I).<br>
For example, when R1 and R2 are both protected hydroxy groups (e.g. benzyloxy groups), and R3 is bromine, the bromine atom can be replaced by trifluoromethyl by reaction with a trifluoroacetate salt (e.g. sodium trifluoroacetate), and copper (I) iodide in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>
In another procedure, compounds of the formula (I) wherein R8 is fluorine can be prepared from compounds of the formula (I) where R8 is hydrogen by electrophilic fluorination. Electrophilic fluorination can be carried out using a fluorinating agent such as l-(chloromethyl)-4-fluoro-l,4-dia/oniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) or similar N-fluoro-diazonia compounds.<br>
In a further procedure, compounds of the formula (I) wherein R1 and R2 are both hydroxy groups can be monomethylated to give a compound where one of R1 and R2 is a methoxy group by reaction with one equivalent of a methylating agent such as dimethylsulphate. The methylation reaction is typically carried<br><br>
put in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium carbonate. Analogous methylation reactions may also be carried out on intermediate compounds containing two phenolic hydroxy groups.<br>
Many of the procedures described below and used in this synthesis are well known to those skilled in the art, and examples of alkylations, acylations, functional group interconversions and reagents and conditions for carrying out such conversions can be found in, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th edition, 119, Wiley Interscience, New York; Fiesers' Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17, John Wiley, edited by Mary Fieser (ISBN: 0-471-58283-2); and Organic Syntheses, Volumes 1-8, John Wiley, edited by Jeremiah P. Freeman (ISBN: 0-471-31192-8).<br>
As well as the specific examples, and the methods of preparation outlined below, it is understood that modification to the routes described would allow synthesis of many further examples of compounds claimed in Formula 1. For example, alternative benzoic acid starting materials with differing or additional substitution patterns could be prepared.<br>
In many of the reactions described above, it may be necessary to protect one or more groups to prevent reaction from taking place at an undesirable location on the molecule. Examples of protecting groups, and methods of protecting and deprotecting functional groups, can be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A hydroxy group may be protected, for example, as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=O)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=O)CH3, -OAc). When the hydroxy group is a phenolic hydroxy group, for example in compounds of the formula (I) wherein R1 and/or R2 are hydroxy, a preferred protecting group is a benzyl group.<br>
An aldehyde or ketone group may be protected, for example, as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=O) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. An amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3); a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6H5, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3)2C6H4C6H5, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), or as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec). Other protecting groups for amines, such as cyclic amines and heterocyclic N-H groups, include toluenesulphonyl (tosyl) and methanesulphonyl (mesyl) groups and benzyl groups such as a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. A carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an C1-7  alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl<br><br>
ester; a t-butyl ester); a C1-7 haloalkyl ester (e.g., a C1-7  trihaloalkyl ester); a triC1-7  alkylsilyl-C1-7 alkyl ester; or a C5.20 aryl-C1-7  alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide. A thiol group may be protected, for example, as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=O)CH3).<br>
Methods of Purification<br>
The compounds may be isolated and purified by a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art and examples of such methods include chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (e.g. flash chromatography) and HPLC. Preparative LC-MS is a standard and effective method used for the purification of small organic molecules such as the compounds described herein. The methods for the liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) can be varied to provide better separation of the crude materials and improved detection of the samples by MS. Optimisation of the preparative gradient LC method will involve varying columns, volatile eluents and modifiers, and gradients. Methods are well known in the art for optimising preparative LC-MS methods and then using them to purify compounds. Such methods are described in Rosentreter U, Huber U.; Optimal fraction collecting in preparative LC/MS; J Comb Chem.; 2004; 6(2), 159-64 and Leister W, Strauss K, Wisnoski D, Zhao Z, Lindsley C., Development of a custom high-throughput preparative liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer platform for the preparative purification and analytical analysis of compound libraries; J Comb Chem.; 2003; 5(3); 322-9.<br>
Alternatively, normal phase preparative LC based methods might be used in place of reverse phase methods. Most preparative LC-MS systems utilise reverse phase LC and volatile acidic modifiers, since the approach is very effective for the purification of small molecules and because the eluents are compatible with positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Employing other chromatographic solutions e.g. normal phase LC, alternatively buffered mobile phase, basic modifiers etc as outlined in the analytical methods described above could alternatively be used to purify the compounds.<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprising at least one active compound of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents; for example agents that reduce or alleviate some of the side effects associated with chemotherapy. Particular examples of such agents include anti-emetic agents and agents that prevent or decrease the duration of chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and prevent complications that arise from reduced levels of red blood cells or white blood cells, for example erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).<br><br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilizers, or other materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the invention provides compounds of the formula (I) and sub-groups thereof as defined herein in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra-vaginal, or transdermal administration. Where the compositions are intended for parenteral administration, they can be formulated for intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous administration or for direct delivery into a target organ or tissue by injection, infusion or other means of delivery. The delivery can be by bolus injection, short term infusion or longer term infusion and can be via passive delivery or through the utilisation of a suitable infusion pump.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, co-solvents, organic solvent mixtures, cyclodextrin complexation agents, emulsifying agents (for forming and stabilizing emulsion formulations), liposome components for forming liposomes, gellable polymers for forming polymeric gels, lyophilisation protectants and combinations of agents for, inter alia, stabilising the active ingredient in a soluble form and rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration may also take the form of aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents (R. G. Strickly, Solubilizing Excipients in oral and injectable formulations, Pharmaceutical Research, Vol 21(2) 2004, p 201-230).<br>
A drug molecule that is ionizable can be solubilized to the desired concentration by pH adjustment if the drug's pKa is sufficiently away from the formulation pH value. The acceptable range is pH 2-12 for intravenous and intramuscular administration, but subcutaneously the range is pH 2.7-9.0. The solution pH is controlled by either the salt form of the drug, strong acids/bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide, or by solutions of buffers which include but are not limited to buffering solutions formed from glycine, citrate, acetate, maleate, succinate, histidine, phosphate, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (TRIS), or carbonate.<br><br>
The combination of an aqueous solution and a water-soluble organic solvent/surfactant (i.e., a cosolvent) is often used in injectable formulations. The water-soluble organic solvents and surfactants used in injectable formulations include but are not limited to propylene glycol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol 300, polyethylene glycol 400, glycerin, dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP; Pharmasolve), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Solutol HS 15, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80. Such formulations can usually be, but are not always, diluted prior to injection.<br>
Propylene glycol, PEG 300, ethanol, Cremophor EL, Cremophor RH 60, and polysorbate 80 are the entirely organic water-miscible solvents and surfactants used in commercially available injectable formulations and can be used in combinations with each other. The resulting organic formulations are usually diluted at least 2-fold prior to IV bolus or IV infusion.<br>
Alternatively increased water solubility can be achieved through molecular complexation with cyclodextrins.<br>
Liposomes are closed spherical vesicles composed of outer lipid bilayer membranes and an inner aqueous core and with an overall diameter of 
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by lyophilising a compound of Formula (I) or acid addition salt thereof. Lyophilisation refers to the procedure of freeze-drying a composition. Freeze-drying and lyophilisation are therefore used herein as synonyms. A typical process is to solubilise the compound and the resulting formulation is clarified, sterile filtered and aseptically transferred to containers appropriate for lyophilisation (e.g. vials). In the case of vials, they are partially stoppered with lyo-stoppers. The formulation can be cooled to freezing and subjected to lyophilisation under standard conditions and then hermetically capped forming a stable, dry lyophile formulation. The composition will typically have a low residual water content, e.g. less than 5% e.g. less than 1% by weight based on weight of the lyophile.<br>
The lyophilisation formulation may contain other excipients for example, thickening agents, dispersing<br><br>
agents, buffers, antioxidants, preservatives, and tonicity adjusters. Typical buffers include phosphate, acetate, citrate and glycine. Examples of antioxidants include ascorbic acid, sodium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, monothioglycerol, thiourea, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyl anisole, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid salts. Preservatives may include benzoic acid and its salts, sorbic acid and its salts, alkyl esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid, phenol, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, thimerosal, benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride. The buffers mentioned previously, as well as dextrose and sodium chloride, can be used for tonicity adjustment if necessary.<br>
Bulking agents are generally used in lyophilisation technology for facilitating the process and/or providing bulk and/or mechanical integrity to the lyophilized cake. Bulking agent means a freely water soluble, solid particulate diluent that when co-lyophilised with the compound or salt thereof, provides a physically stable lyophilized cake, a more optimal freeze-drying process and rapid and complete reconstitution. The bulking agent may also be utilised to make the solution isotonic.<br>
The water-soluble bulking agent can be any of the pharmaceutically acceptable inert solid materials typically used for lyophilisation. Such bulking agents include, for example, sugars such as glucose, maltose, sucrose, and lactose; polyalcohols such as sorbitol or mannitol; amino acids such as glycine; polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidine; and polysaccharides such as dextran.<br>
The ratio of the weight of the bulking agent to the weight of active compound is typically within the range from about 1 to about 5, for example of about 1 to about 3, e.g. in the range of about 1 to 2.<br>
Alternatively they can be provided in a solution form which may be concentrated and sealed in a suitable vial. Sterilisation of dosage forms may be via filtration or by autoclaving of the vials and their contents at appropriate stages of the formulation process. The supplied formulation may require further dilution or preparation before delivery for example dilution into suitable sterile infusion packs.<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for i.v. administration, for example by injection or infusion.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in a form suitable for sub-cutaneous (s.c.) administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, lozenges, syrups, solutions, powders, granules, elixirs and suspensions, sublingual tablets, wafers or patches and buccal patches.<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in accordance with known techniques, see for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, USA.<br>
Thus, tablet compositions can contain a unit dosage of active compound together with an inert diluent or carrier such as a sugar or sugar alcohol, eg; lactose, sucrose, sorbitol or mannitol; and/or a non-sugar derived diluent such as sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, or a cellulose or derivative thereof such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, and starches such as corn starch. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here.<br>
Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semi-solid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof.<br>
The solid dosage forms (eg; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit ™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum.<br>
Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the drug can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g. a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in "patient packs" containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally<br><br>
missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions.<br>
Compositions for topical use include ointments, creams, sprays, patches, gels, liquid drops and inserts (for example intraocular inserts). Such compositions can be formulated in accordance with known methods.<br>
Compositions for parenteral administration are typically presented as sterile aqueous or oily solutions or fine suspensions, or may be provided in finely divided sterile powder form for making up extemporaneously with sterile water for injection.<br>
Examples of formulations for rectal or intra-vaginal administration include pessaries and suppositories which may be, for example, formed from a shaped moldable or waxy material containing the active compound.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may take the form of inhalable powder compositions or liquid or powder sprays, and can be administrated in standard form using powder inhaler devices or aerosol dispensing devices. Such devices are well known. For administration by inhalation, the powdered formulations typically comprise the active compound together with an inert solid powdered diluent such as lactose.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) will generally be presented in unit dosage form and, as such, will typically contain sufficient compound to provide a desired level of biological activity. For example, a formulation may contain from 1 nanogram to 2 grams of active ingredient, e.g. from 1 nanogram to 2 milligrams of active ingredient. Within this range, particular sub-ranges of compound are 0.1 milligrams to 2 grams of active ingredient (more usually from 10 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 50 milligrams to 500 milligrams), or 1 microgram to 20 milligrams (for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams, e.g. 0.1 milligrams to 2 milligrams of active ingredient).<br>
For oral compositions, a unit dosage form may contain from 1 milligram to 2 grams, more typically 10 milligrams to 1 gram, for example 50 milligrams to 1 gram, e.g. 100 miligrams to 1 gram, of active compound.<br>
The active compound will be administered to a patient in need thereof (for example a human or animal patient) in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
Methods of Treatment<br>
It is envisaged that the compounds of the formula (I) and sub-groups as defined herein will be useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of a range of disease states or conditions mediated by Hsp90 client proteins. Examples of such disease states and conditions are set out above.<br><br>
The compounds are generally administered to a subject in need of such administration, for example a human or animal patient, preferably a human.<br>
The compounds will typically be administered in amounts that are therapeutically or prophylactically useful and which generally are non-toxic. However, in certain situations (for example in the case of life threatening diseases), the benefits of administering a compound of the formula (I) may outweigh the disadvantages of any toxic effects or side effects, in which case it may be considered desirable to administer compounds in amounts that are associated with a degree of toxicity.<br>
The compounds may be administered over a prolonged term to maintain beneficial therapeutic effects or may be administered for a short period only. Alternatively they may be administered in a pulsatile or continuous manner.<br>
A typical daily dose of the compound of formula (I) can be in the range from 100 picograms to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, more typically 5 nanograms to 25 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, and more usually 10 nanograms to 15 milligrams per kilogram (e.g. 10 nanograms to 10 milligrams, and more typically 1 microgram per kilogram to 20 milligrams per kilogram, for example 1 microgram to 10 milligrams per kilogram) per kilogram of bodyweight although higher or lower doses may be administered where required. The compound can be administered on a daily basis or on a repeat basis every 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 or 14, or 21, or 28 days for example.<br>
In one particular dosing schedule, a patient will be given an infusion of a compound for periods of one hour daily for up to ten days in particular up to five days for one week, and the treatment repeated at a desired interval such as two to four weeks, in particular every three weeks.<br>
More particularly, a patient may be given an infusion of a compound for periods of one hour daily for 5 days and the treatment repeated every three weeks.<br>
In another particular dosing schedule, a patient is given an infusion over 30 minutes to 1 hour followed by maintenance infusions of variable duration, for example 1 to 5 hours, e.g. 3 hours.<br>
In a further particular dosing schedule, a patient is given a continuous infusion for a period of 12 hours to 5 days, an in particular a continuous infusion of 24 hours to 72 hours.<br>
Ultimately, however, the quantity of compound administered and the type of composition used will be commensurate with the nature of the disease or physiological condition being treated and will be at the discretion of the physician.<br>
The compounds as defined herein can be administered as the sole therapeutic agent or they can be administered in combination therapy with one of more other compounds for treatment of a particular disease state, for example a neoplastic disease such as a cancer as hereinbefore defined.<br><br>
Examples of other therapeutic agents or treatments that may be administered together (whether concurrently or at different time intervals) with the compounds of the formula (I) include but are not limited to:<br>
•	Topoisomerase I inhibitors<br>
•	Antimetabolites<br>
•	Tubulin targeting agents<br>
•	DNA binder and topoisomerase II inhibitors<br>
•	Alkylating Agents<br>
•	Monoclonal Antibodies.<br>
•	Anti-Hormones<br>
•	Signal Transduction Inhibitors<br>
•	Proteasome Inhibitors<br>
•	DNA methyl transferases<br>
•	Cytokines and retinoids<br>
•	Chromatin targeted therapies, e.g. HDAC or HAT modulators<br>
•	Radiotherapy.<br>
For the case of Hsp90 inhibitors combined with other therapies, the two or more treatments may be given in individually varying dose schedules and via different routes.<br>
Where the compound is administered in combination therapy with one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents (preferably one or two, more preferably one), the compounds can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When administered sequentially, they can be administered at closely spaced intervals (for example over a period of 5-10 minutes) or at longer intervals (for example 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours apart, or even longer periods apart where required), the precise dosage regimen being commensurate with the properties of the therapeutic agent(s).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be administered in conjunction with non-chemotherapeutic treatments such as radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, gene therapy; surgery and controlled diets.<br>
For use in combination therapy with another chemotherapeutic agent, the compound and one, two, three, four or more other therapeutic agents can be, for example, formulated together in a dosage form containing two, three, four or more therapeutic agents. In an alternative, the individual therapeutic agents may be formulated separately and presented together in the form of a kit, optionally with instructions for their use.<br>
A person skilled in the art would know through his or her common general knowledge the dosing regimes and combination therapies to use.<br><br>
Methods of Diagnosis<br>
Prior to administration of a compound, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against Hsp90.<br>
For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to the mutation or over-activation of an Hsp90 client protein. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation of Hsp90 client proteins include; Bcr-ABL translocation, Flt-3 internal duplication, and mutation of Braf, or over-expression of ErbB2.<br>
Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up-regulation. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of Braf, BCR-abl, and Flt3 or other affected client proteins. The term marker also includes proteins such as ErbB2, including levels or concentrations of the protein or some fragments or degradation product and for enzymes the enzymic activity. The protein (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins could also be assessed to characterise a change in activity. For example the level of phosphorylated AKT can be an indicator of sensitivity to HSP90 inhibitors<br>
The diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from for example tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, buccal spears or biopsy or from urine.<br>
The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide or protein microarray analysis, proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry or detection using a specific antibody.<br>
Methods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are well known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in-situ hybridisation or immunoblotting.<br>
In screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, P.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., or Innis, M.A. et-al., eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., 2001, 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a<br><br>
commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
An example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer, 1987 Meth. Enzymol., 152: 649).<br>
Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce non-specific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labelled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Commercially available FISH probes also exist for cytogenetic detection of chromosome rearrangemrnts, which can be used to detect Flt3 and Bcr-Abl translocations within leukeamia cell populations. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, P.M. et al., eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine.<br>
Methods for gene expression profiling are described by (DePrimo et al., BMC Cancer 2003, 3:3). Briefly, the protocol is as follows: double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from total RNA Using a (dT)24 oligomer for priming first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers. The double-stranded cDNA is used as a template for in vitro transcription of cRNA using biotinylated ribonucleotides. cRNA is chemically fragmented according to protocols described by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), and then hybridized overnight on Human Genome Arrays.<br>
Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtiter plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of the "Philadelphia chromosome" indicative of BCR-ABL translocation.<br>
Therefore, all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the compounds of the invention.<br><br>

In the following general methods, the volumes stated may vary according to the scale of the reaction, as will be apparent to the skilled person.<br>
METHOD A1<br>
Amide coupling (acid chloride method)<br>
A mixture of a carboxylic acid (1 equivalent) and thionyl chloride (1.5 equivalents) in benzene (or toluene) was stirred and held at reflux for 2 hours. Excess amine was added dropwise to the hot solution and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. Alternatively, the acid chloride could be isolated by evaporation and then re-dissolved in a 9:1 mixture of dichloromethane: triethylamine and the amine then added and the mixture stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 1-18 hours. In either case, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and extracted successively with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 2M hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was reduced to dryness in vacua and the pure products were obtained either by trituration with ethyl acetate or by column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) or in a few cases by preparative HPLC/MS.<br>
METHOD A2<br>

A stirred solution of protected derivative (1 equivalent) and a catalytic amount of 10% palladium on carbon (typically 30-50 mg) in ethanol (5-10 ml), methanol (5-10 ml) or methanol/DCM (3ml / 3ml) was stirred at room temperature under an atmosphere of hydrogen for 2-16 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration, washed with methanol (5 ml) and the solvent removed in vacua to afford the products. Some required purification by flash chromatography, eluting typically with ether.<br>
METHOD A6 Suzuki coupling<br>
The aryl bromide (1 equivalent, typically 0.5 mmol), boronic acid or potassium vinyl trifluoroborate derivative (1.2 equivalents) and caesium carbonate (3 equivalents) were dissolved in THF (10 ml) under<br><br>
nitrogen. l,l'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] palladium(II) dichloride (0.1 equivalent) was added and then water (1 ml). The mixture begins to darken until black. The mixture was then heated at reflux under nitrogen until the reaction is complete (8-45 hrs). The mixture was cooled, diluted with DCM and magnesium sulphate added. The mixture was filtered and the solvent evaporated. The resulting residues were purified by flash chromatography in pet. ether / ether mixtures, and generally gave product in good yield (-60-80%).<br>
METHOD A7<br>
Resorcinol rnono-O-methylation<br>
Dimethyl sulphate (1 equivalent) was added to a stirred solution of the resorcinol (1 equivalent) and potassium carbonate (2.2 equivalents) in acetonitrile (10 ml per mmol of substrate) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The solvent was removed in vacua, the residue partitioned between dichloromethane and water, the organic layer separated and the solvent removed in vacuo. The pure products were obtained either after column chromatography on silica (eluting with mixtures of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate) or by preparative HPLC/MS.<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
EXAMPLE 80<br>
Isothermal titration calorimetry<br>
The ability of the compounds of the invention to bind to human Hsp90 proteins was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry.<br>
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed with a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA, USA). Cloning, expression, and purification of the Human Hsp90a N-terminal domain were performed according to published methods (Jez, J.M. et al, Chem Biol. 2003<br><br>
apr;10(4):361-8.) Solutions of the human Hsp90a N-terminal domain and compound were prepared in a buffer comprising 25 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, ImM TCEP, 5% DMSO, pH 7.4. All solutions were filtered and degassed prior to a titration being carried out. The enthalpy change resulting from each injection of ligand was obtained through integration of the calorimetric signal. Data were analysed using Origin 7.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Heats of dilution were estimated using the final injections of each individual titration and subtracted before data fitting. Different ITC experimental formats were employed in order to obtain compound dissociation constants (Kd's) over a wide range of affinities. For weakly binding compounds a low c-value ITC method was used (Turnbull W.B. &amp; Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003 Dec 3;125(48):14859-66) in which the protein was present at 10-20µM in the calorimetric cell and the compound concentration was 1-20 mM in the injection syringe. In this type of experiment the stoichiometry parameter (N) was locked at 1 for data fitting. For Kd's in the 20-0.004 uM range the experiment was configured such that the binding site concentration divided by the Kd (c-value) was between 5 and 1000. For the majority of these experiments the protein concentration in the calorimetric cell was in the range 4-100 uM and the ligand concentration in the injection syringe ranged from 50-1500 uM. In rare cases where compound solubility was limiting, the compound solution was placed in the calorimetric cell and titrated with protein from the injection syringe, maintaining a c-value between 5 and 1000. Competition ITC experiments were used to access Kd's

EXAMPLE 81 Anti-proliferative Activity<br>
The anti-proliferative activities of compounds of the invention can be determined by measuring the ability of the compounds to inhibition of cell growth in a number of cell lines such as the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. Inhibition of cell growth is measured using the Alamar Blue assay (Nociari, M. M, Shalev, A., Benias, P., Russo, C. Journal of Immunological Methods 1998, 213, 157-167). The method is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce resazurin to its fluorescent product resorufm. For each proliferation assay cells are plated onto 96 well plates and allowed to recover for 16 hours prior to<br><br>
The addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. At the end of the incubation period 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue is added and incubated for a further 6 hours prior to determination of fluorescent product at 535nM ex / 590nM em. In the case of the non-proliferating cell assay cells are maintained at confluence for 96 hour prior to the addition of inhibitor compounds for a further 72 hours. The number of viable cells is determined by Alamar Blue assay as before. Cell lines can be obtained from the ECACC (European Collection of cell Cultures).<br>
