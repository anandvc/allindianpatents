TITLE OF INVENTION:-    Green Power Diesel.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:-   Alternative mixed fuel for internal combustion engine<br>
(diesel engine)<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION WITH REGARD TO THE DRAWBACK OF ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN ART:-<br>
No doubt, Diesel is an excellent fuel for both light and heavy diesel engines. But there are some problems i.e. it creates lot of CO2, CO, Carbon particles etc. &amp; creates a lot of starting problem in cold season. Moreover, though diesel has self lubricating quality yet the quality of lubrication that diesel produces is not high. So diesel engines need extra lubricant in fuel for safety of the engines (combustion chambers). Other fuels for diesel engines such as Bio-Diesel or B100 is very costly (about Rs. 70/- per litre), and also it has a costly and lengthy preparation procedure, emission of NOx gasses is very high, less powerful (121000 btu./ gallon), and creates a lot of problems in cold season. It is the need of the day to have such a fuel that ought to be eco-friendly and efficient.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION:-<br>
The object of our invention is to solve the aforesaid problems and to produce such a fuel for usual diesel engines which is more powerful than diesel and B100, very fast ignitable, less pollutant than diesel &amp; B100 in respect to the emission of COx &amp; NOx gasses, has a better self lubricating property and easy to produce.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
According to this invention there is provided a self lubricating mixed fuel for diesel engine comprising usual petroleum diesel, non-mineral vegetable fat (mainly mustard oil) and acetone.<br>
According to this invention there is also provided a process of preparing the self lubricating mixed fuel thereby preparing a homogeneous mixture of usual petroleum diesel, non-mineral vegetable fat &amp; acetone with an external impulse.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION:-<br>
The said invention, GREEN POWER DIESEL, is a new kind of mixed fuel for usual diesel vehicle engines and stationary diesel engines. This fuel is a homogeneous mixture of usual petroleum Diesel, Non-mineral vegetable fat (mainly Mustard oil) and Acetone (CH3COCH3) in a specific ratio. We have tested this fuel on a Hindustan Motor's Ambassador Diesel car and on a 5H.P. diesel engine which is generally used for water pump set or for driving an alternator and we have found excellent result. The car has been driven so smoothly that professional drivers and motor mechanics can't find any difficulty in it.<br><br>
The proportion of three components is as follows-Usual Petroleum Diesel: Non-mineral vegetable fat: Acetone - 77 : 20 : 3<br>
In this fuel we use Acetone which mixes very easily with the mixture of Petroleum Diesel and Mustard oil without any mixing reagent. Acetone catches fire very easily and it is a volatile chemical having a low boiling point of 56.5° C. This chemical helps the fuel in two ways. It helps the fuel to catch the fire quickly. Diesel engine is a compression ignition engine and if we use heavier fuel in this engine then in a high speed diesel engine it creates burning problem. But use of Acetone solves this type of problem. Also it solves the starting problem of diesel engines in colder season. In other way Acetone resists the diesel to be frozen. In other words, acetone plays the role of an agitator. The petroleum diesel and mustard oil do not make homogeneous mixture quickly without imposition of any external impulse. Mustard oil has very higher energy content than any other fuel. The energy content of mustard oil is 156,000 Btu. / Gallon. Mustard oil has very high lubricating quality in higher temperature as well as lower temperature. We find that between 10° F to 250°F the lubricating property of mustard oil remains unchanged. So by using mustard oil we can get higher energy level and very good self- lubricating quality.<br>
Rapeseed oil and Rice bran oil are other non-mineral vegetable fats which have almost same kind of properties as that of mustard oil. So Rapeseed oil and Rice bran oil can also be used in place of mustard oil for producing the invented fuel Green Power Diesel. In case of each non-mineral vegetable fat the ratio of the components will be same, i.e.<br>
Usual Petroleum Diesel: Mustard oil: Acetone = 77 : 20 : 3<br>
Usual Petroleum Diesel: Rapeseed oil: Acetone = 77: 20 : 3<br>
Usual Petroleum Diesel: Rice bran oil: Acetone - 77 : 20 : 3<br>
So, it can be said that the invented fuel Green Power Diesel is a homogeneous mixture of usual petroIeumDiesel, Non-mineral vegetable fat and Acetone mixed at the ratio 77:20:3. Non-mineral vegetable fats viz. mustard oil, rapeseed oil and rice bran oil have self oxygen content. So at the time of burning these oils create less quantity of carbon particle and COx gasses in comparison to diesel. That's why by using aforesaid non-mineral vegetable fats in the said invented fuel comparatively better result in case of pollution is achieved.<br>
The components of said invented fuel are mixed with the help of external force viz. jerk / stirring so as to make a homogeneous mixture. For industrial / commercial production at large scale, machinery for doing the job will be required. The adjoining drawing (Fig.-l) for such type of machinery will be purposeful in this regard.<br>
As shown in the Fig.-l, three underground tanks are there one each for petroleum Diesel, Mustard oil and Green Power Diesel. The fourth one being placed on the ground is for Acetone. Raw materials are stored in the respective tanks and there from those are pumped to the Mixing Machine at the specified ratio. The mixing machine mixes the components into a homogeneous liquid termed as GREEN POWER DIESEL, which in turn is stored in the storage tank. Delivery of the fuel is done by the pump.<br>
Comparative study of Green Power Diesel with other fuels:-<br>
A) Comparative energy content of Green Power Diesel and other fuels:<br><br><br><br>
The energy density of said invented fuel is more than other Diesel engine fuels i.e. usual petroleum Diesel and B100. The average mileage of a vehicle obviously depends on engine design as well as on the quality of fuel. The age of engine is also a factor. The comparative average mileage of the testing vehicle which is a Hindustan Motor's Ambassador 1500 c.c. Diesel car, in case of usual petroleum Diesel and Green Power Diesel is as below:-<br><br>
B)       Comparative self-lubricating quality of Green Power Diesel and other    fuels:-<br>
Petrol or gasoline needs mobile as lubricant. Diesel is to some extent self lubricating, but the quality of lubrication is not very high. So Diesel needs lubricant for the safety of the combustion chambers of diesel engines. But Green Power Diesel creates very fine lubricant at the time of burning.<br>
C) Comparative emission study of Green Power Diesel and other fuels:-<br><br>
D) Other advantages of Green Power Diesel:-<br>
It is nontoxic and partly biodegradable (23% of the fuel). Any kind of change or modification in usual diesel engine is not necessary to use Green Power Diesel as fuel. Generally usual petroleum diesel and bio-diesel create a lot of starting problem in colder season as those fuels become very cold to have igniting at earlier effort, but the Green Power Diesel is very fast ignitable even in colder season.<br><br><br>
Basic differences between Green Power Diesel and B20:-<br>
GREEN POWER DIESEL		B20<br>
Homogeneous mixture of 77 %   Mixture of 20% Biodiesel &amp; 80% usual petroleum<br>
usual petroleum Diesel, 20 %   Diesel<br>
Non-mineral   vegetable  fat  &amp;<br>
3 % Acetone.		<br>
Mustard oil, Rapeseed oil &amp; Biodiesel is made from natural oils &amp; fats after being Rice bran oil are natural Non- treated for breaking into esters and gtycerol with the mineral vegetable fats which are help of methanol &amp; a catalyst (usually sodium or blended with usual petroleum   potassium hydroxide) wherefrom esters are separated<br>
Diesel directly.	    and purified for being used as a fuel	_<br>
Non-mineral vegetable fat being Biodiesel being a composition of esters gives much used    directly     gives    better   less lubrication<br>
lubrication.    	___	_____<br>
Acetone being a component acts   Since there is no such facility, it gives trouble in<br>
as an agitator and helps fast   winter season to take start / ignition<br>
ignition.	<br><br>
