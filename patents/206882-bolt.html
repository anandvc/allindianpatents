				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to threaded connectors for connecting two parts with one another.<br>
Threaded connectors of this type are known in the art. Some known threaded connectors are formed as threaded bolts with or without a head, and with or without a nut. One of the threaded connectors is disclosed for example in my U.S. Patent 5,318,397 as well as in my other patents. The bolts or threaded connectors can be further improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new bolt which is a further improvement of the existing bolts.<br>
In keeping with these objects and with others which will become apparent hereinafter, the present invention provides a bolt for connecting two parts with one another, comprising a bolt member having an axis, a threaded portion provided with a thread, and another portion having a polygonal circumference ; a friction member connected to said polygonal circumference of said other portion of said bolt member and having a first facial area adapted to abut against a facial area of one of the parts, and also having an opposite second facial area ; and a sleeve connectable to said thread of said threaded portion of said bolt member and having a facial area abutting against said<br>
-2-<br><br>
second facial area of said friction washer, so that when a given force is applied in one direction to said bolt member and a given force is applied in an opposite direction to said sleeve, only said sleeve turns while said bolt member is elongated or relaxed.<br>
When the bolt is designed in accordance with the present Invention, it has a simple construction and can be elongated and relaxed when needed.<br>
The novel features which are considered as characteristic for the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The single figure of the drawing is a view showing a bolt for connecting two parts with one another in accordance with the present invention<br>
-3-<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A bolt in accordance with present invention has a bolt member which is identified as a whole with reference numeral 1 and has an axis. The bolt member 1 has a threaded portion 2 located substantially at one end of the bolt member and provided with a thread. The bolt member 1 further has another portion which is identified with reference numeral 3 and has a polygonal circumference. The polygonal circumference bolt portion 3 is axiaily spaced from the threaded bolt portion 2. Finally, the bolt member 1 has a shaft portion 4 which can be provided with a not shown head on an opposite side. The polygonal circumference of the bolt portion 4 can be formed by a plurality of splines which extend in the axiai direction of the bolt member and are spaced from one another in a peripheral direction of the bolt member 1.<br>
The bolt further has a friction washer which is identified as a whole with reference numeral 5. The friction washer has a first facia! area 6 which abuts against a facia! area 7 of one of the parts to be connected with one another. The parts to be connected with one another are identified with reference numerals 8 and 9. The friction washer 5 is conneciable with the polygonal circumference of the bolt portion 3. In particular, the friction washer 5 has .an inner surface having a shape corresponding to the shape<br><br>
of the outer surface of the bolt portion 3. In the shown embodiment, the inner surface of the friction washer 5 is provided with a plurality of splines which correspond to the splines of the bolt portion 3 and engage with these splines. Therefore, the bolt member 1 can not rotate relative to the friction washer 5, but can displace in an axia! direction relative to the friction washer<br>
The bolt further has a sleeve which is identified with reference numeral 9. The sleeve 9 has a facial area 10 which abuts against an opposite facial area 11 of the friction washer 5. The sleeve 9 is connected with the thread of the threaded portion 2 of the bolt member 1. In particular, the sleeve 9 is provided with an inner thread which corresponds to the outer thread of the threaded portion 2 of the bolt member 1, so as to engage the outer thread of the bolt portion 2.<br>
The bolt in accordance with the present invention operates in the following manner:<br>
When a given force is applied in one direction to the bolt member 1 and a given force is applied in an opposite direction to the sleeve 9, only the sleeve 9 turns while the bolt member 1 is elongated or relaxed. The reason is that on the one hand the bolt member can not turn since it is<br><br>
non rotatabiy fixed by its polygonal circumference portion 3 in the friction washer 5, and on the other hand, the bolt member 1 can not move axially since its outer thread engages with the inner thread of the sleeve 9. Only the elongation or relaxation of the bolt member 1 is performed.<br>
On the other hand, it is also<br>
possible that the opposite force is an active force intended to rotate the sleeve 9 in a circumferential direction which is opposite to the circumferential direction of rotation of the bolt member 1.<br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in bolt, It is not intended to be limited to the details s.hov/r,, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention,<br>
6<br><br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the<br>
generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br>
What is claimed as new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent Is set forth in the appended claims.<br>
7<br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
1.	A bolt for connecting two parts with one another, comprising a bolt<br>
member having an axis, a threaded portion provided with a thread, and another<br>
portion having a polygonal circumference ; a friction member connected to said<br>
polygonal circumference of said other portion of said bolt member and having a<br>
first facial area adapted to abut against a facial area of one of the parts, and also<br>
having an opposite second facial area ; and a sleeve connectable to said thread<br>
of said threaded portion of said bolt member and having a facial area abutting<br>
against said second facial area of said friction washer so that when a given<br>
force is applied in one direction to said bolt member and a given force is applied<br>
in an opposite direction to said sleeve, only said sleeve turns while said bolt<br>
member is elongated or relaxed.<br>
2.	A bolt as claimed in claim 1, wherein said threaded portion of said<br>
bolt member and said other portion of said member provided with said polygonal<br>
circumference are axially spaced from one another.<br>
