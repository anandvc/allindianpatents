				<td>The present invention relates to a carbon black reactor.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a carbon black reactor, and more particularly to a carbon black reactor having the feedstock introduction part of a novel cross-section shape for modifying, the manner of a contact between a hot combustion gas and a feedstock to produce a carbon black in large output without any sacrifice of carbon black characteristics, especially a distribution of an aggregate size (a minimum dispersion unit into a rubber matrix) measured by centrifugal sedimentation analysis.<br>
Background Art<br>
Carbon blacks are generally produced in Furnace process. In this process, at first, a hydrocarbon fuel is burned with an excess amount of oxygen typically supplied as a flow of air or oxygen containing gas in the space having a lining of fire resistant material to produce a hot combustion gas. Then, a high molecular weight hydrocarbon oil as feedstock is injected in a plurality of streams to the hot combustion gas, and the feedstock is thermally decomposed and dehydrogenated to prepare an aerosol which contains carbon black particles suspended in the gas. Finally, the carbon black particles are separated from the gas and collected. The resultant carbon black collected as a fluffy powder can be pelletized by means of conventional pelletizihg methods.<br>
Since the carbon blacks of various characteristics and grades can be produced by adjusting various operating condition, for example, an amount and a position of the introduction of a fuel; an amount, a position and a manner of a introduction of feedstock and oxygen containing gas; a position of quenching; a diameter of reactor and so on; most of carbon black is produced in this process at the present.<br>
Carbon blacks are produced in large quantities throughout the world and commonly used as reinforcing filler for an elastomer and as pigment or colorant for a plastic, a paint and a printing ink. The largest application field of a carbon black is a manufacture of pneumatic tires for automotive and aircraft, wherein the carbon black is used as reinforcing filler for a rubber matrix to impart mechanical strength<br><br>
and wear resistance to it.<br>
Recently, the problems from environmental and/or safety aspects are emphasized in the tire industry, and a further demand for lower fuel consumption, longer service life and improved grip performance are intensified. Although a rubber itself must be improved, a carbon black is also requested to improve for such demands. That is, a carbon black is required to control not only conventional macroscopic properties, such as a specific surface area and a structure, but also microscope properties, such as a particle size, an aggregate size and distributions of them. Therefore, it becomes important to develop the carbon black reactor which can easily control these microscopic properties. In addition, there is need for carbon black reactor which can increase the output of the carbon black, and which can effectively utilize the thermal energy of the hot combustion gas.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, many techniques and patents relating to the geometry and the operating condition of a carbon black reactor have bean disclosed.<br>
As mentioned above, since a carbon black is produced by injecting the feedstock into the hot combustion gas occurred from burning the hydrocarbon fuel with the oxygen containing gas, and thermally decomposing and/or incompletely combusting the feedstock, the manner of contact of the hot combustion gas and the feedstock has much influence upon the physical or chemical characteristics of the carbon black, especially the properties of the aggregate, unit particle size which said aggregate is composed, and the distribution of .said size. Therefore, there is prior art that the contact condition is altered to improve the characteristics of the carbon black. For example, it is disclosed that the contact condition is changed by introducing the carbon black separately produced in different contact condition to the feedstock introducing chamber to widen the distribution of the aggregate size (For example, Japanese patent publication No. Hei64-4659, Applicant: Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd).<br>
In other prior art, to achieve the high efficiency for the use of heat energy, the facility for scale up, the high output of product, and the ability to produce high quality product, the feedstock is introduced into the hot combustion gas in the form of a plurality of individual coherent streams substantially from the exterior periphery and a plurality of individual coherent streams outwardly, substantially transversely from at least one location in the interior (US 3,922,335, Assignee: Cabot Corporation).<br>
In another example, the reaction chamber of the carbon black reactor was defined by a plurality of flat planes so that the cross-section shape of the flow of the hot combustion gas substantially conforms to the spray pattern of the feedstock, thereby providing a minimum flame length within the reactor and more efficient use of the hot combustion gas (USP 5,256,388, Assignee: Colombian Chemicals Company).<br>
In the meantime, considering the temperature and the flow velocity of the hot combustion gas at the position where the feedstock is introduced (the flow velocity may be extremely high such as approximate sound velocity), when the feedstock is introduced to the hot combustion gas, especially in the atomized form, the feedstock would be flowed by the flow of the hot combustion gas toward a downstream. In case that the space where feedstock is introduced is narrow, however, contact efficiency of the hot combustion gas and the feedstock is high because most of the cross-section of the feedstock introduction part is covered with the feedstock (Figure 8).<br>
On the other hand, when a cross-section of the feedstock introduction part is widened in order to increase a amount of the feedstock introduced, which in turn leads to increase a output of a carbon black, the hot combustion gas which does not contact with the feedstock and passes toward the downstream is increased especially at the central region of said part (Figure 9).<br>
As compared with Figure 8 and Figure 9, it is clearly understood that the contact efficiency between the hot combustion gas and the feedstock in the carbon black reactor having enlarged feedstock introduction part is considerably lower than that in the reactor having narrow feedstock introduction part.<br>
This is a reason why there is the difference in the carbon black characteristics, such as the distributions of unit particle size and the aggregate size between the pilot-scale reactor, which has a narrow feedstock introduction part, and the reactor actually operated. That is, in the pilot-scale reactor, the both distributions are narrow, whereas in the reactor actually operated, said distributions are wider than the former.<br>
As mentioned above, when a carbon black is produced in the reactor actually operated, it is very difficult to obtain the product having the characteristics of one produced in the pilot-scale plant. Accordingly, if narrow distribution of the unit constituent particle size and the aggregate size is required for the carbon black, use of many pilot-scale reactors at the same is an only measure to produce it<br>
having such characteristics in the large scale.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to solve the scanty output of a carbon black, which is the largest defect of the production in the pilot-scale reactor, while the contact efficiency between the hot combustion gas and the feedstock is maintained high.<br>
Therefore, first subject of the present invention is to provide a novel carbon black reactor which increases the contact efficiency between the hot combustion gas and the feedstock to improve the conversion rate from the feedstock to the carbon black. Second subject of the present invention is to provide a novel car-bon black reactor which produces a carbon black characterized that the distribution of an aggregate, which is the smallest dispersion unit to a rubber matrix, is narrow-er than a common product in a large scale production at a low cost.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In order to solve these subjects, the inventor tries to alter the cross-section shape of the feedstock introducing chamber to various shapes, and finally found a suitable shape for production of the carbon black having desired characteristics.<br>
That is, the present invention refers to a carbon black reactor comprising; a combustion zone for generating a hot combustion gas by burning a mixture of a hydrocarbon fuel and an oxygen containing gas,<br>
a reaction zone for producing a carbon black by contacting said hot combustion gas with a feedstock introduced in a plurality of divided flows to thermally decompose and/or incompletely combust the feedstock, and<br>
a quench zone for stopping a carbon black growth reaction by injecting a coolant (ordinarily water) to said carbon black containing flow, and these three zones are arrayed laterally in order,<br>
wherein the cross-section shape of the feedstock introduction part in said reaction zone is not a circle nor a polygon.<br>
In the present invention, the cross-section shape of the reaction chamber, especially at feedstock introduction part, is not a circle nor a polygon, in addition, there is a difference in length between the longest axis and the shortest axis. At feedstock introduction part, feedstock atomizing means are arranged at proper locations so as not to make any space in which a hot combustion gas does not contact with the feedstock streams and passes to the downstream, particularly in a central region of the reaction zone. Thus, a contact efficiency between the hot<br>
combustion gas and the feedstock is increased to improve a conversion ratio from the feedstock to the carbon black.<br>
The cross-section shape of the feedstock introduction part is neither a circle nor a polygon. Preferably, a ratio of a longest axis (major axis) of said cross-section shape to a shortest axis (minor axis) thereof ranges from 1.5 to 20, particularly more from 2 to 10.<br>
As long as above requirements are satisfied, there is no restriction for said cross-section shape. Said cross-section shape is formed of a combination of curved lines and curved lines such as semicircle or circle segment and ellipse, or semicircle or circle segment and open curve, or a combination of curved lines and straight lines such as semicircle and straight line (torus), circle segment and straight line, or ellipses segment and straight line. Herein, the curved line includes closed curves such as a circle or an ellipse, or open curves such as a cycloid, an involute, a parabola and a hyperbola. The segments of these can also be applied to a part of said cross-section shape. However, ellipse can be applied to said cross-section shape as it is. In the case that a segment of circles and/or ellipses is applied to the cross-section shape, its center angle made by a center of the circle or the ellipse and two ends of the segment is 180° or less.<br>
As for example of said cross-section shape, it is mentioned that the shape formed of the combination of two semicircles and two straight lines as shown in Figure 2, i.e. torus, the shape formed of the combination of two circle segments and two straight lines as shown in Figure 4, or the shape formed of the combinations of two circle segments and two ellipse segments as shown in Figure 5.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
In the following, the detail of the present invention will be explained with reference to the figures enclosed.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the carbon black reactor 1 has a combustion zone consisting of the hydrocarbon fuel introduction chamber 2, the oxygen con-taining gas introduction conduit 3, the oxygen containing gas conduit 4, the current plates 5, the combustion chamber 7 and the intermediate conversion chamber 8; a reaction zone consisting of on the reaction chamber 10; and a quench zone con-sisting of the reaction continuation and quench chambers 11,12 and 13.<br>
There is the introduction chamber 2 at the upstream end of the carbon black reactor 1, and the introduction conduit 3 is provided to the outside of the introduction chamber 2. In the introduction chamber 2, the conduit 4 which has a cylindrical geometry is provided concentrically. The conduit 4 has a diameter smaller and a length shorter than the introduction chamber 2, and the downstream thereof is constant with the introduction chamber 2. At the outer periphery of the conduit 4, the current plates 5 are provided to rectify the flow of oxygen containing gas. Preferably, the current plates 5 are installed by equal degree and suitable number of them are from 10 to 20. Along with the central axis of the introduction chamber 2 and the conduit 4, the fuel introduction tube (not shown) is provided<br>
through the space 6. To the downstream of the introduction chamber 2, the com-bustion chamber 7 of a cylindrical geometry is connected concentrically, the diameter of the combustion chamber 7 being same as or a little smaller than that of introduction chamber 2.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the intermediate conversion chamber 8 is connected to the downstream of the combustion chamber 7. The cross-section shape of the conversion chamber 8 changes from the circle to the torus little by little to prevent sudden change of the shape in horizontal (lateral) direction. To the downstream of the conversion chamber 8, the reaction chamber 10 of the toric cross-section shape is connected, and the plurality of feedstock atomizing means 9 are provided on the reaction chamber 10. As shown in a vertical section of Figure 1(a), both the conversion chamber 8 and the introduction chamber 10 have a continuously converged geometry, and the convergence angle is 2-20°, preferably 3-10° against the central axis<br>
The atomizing means 9 are arranged at three feedstock introduction parts 9-1, 9-2 and 9-3 in the reaction chamber 10, and there are eight atomizing means 9 in each part. The number of the atomizing means 9 and the part arranged the atomizing means 9, and the position of the part to be used are selected suitably depending on quality and grade of the carbon black intended to obtain.<br>
To the downstream of the reaction chamber 10, there is the reaction con-tinuation and quench chambers 11,12 and 13, which volumes are larger than that of the reaction chamber 10, and which are provided the plurality of the coolant (water) introduction means (a-f) for quenching the carbon black containing gas to stop a carbon black growing reaction. The cross-section shape of said chambers are changed at will. In this embodiment, however, the cross-section shape of chamber 11 has a similar figure with that of the reaction chamber 10 on the downstream side, i.e. a torus, to keep the degree of the turbulence of the carbon black containing gas constant in the chamber 11. The chamber 11 is connected to the chamber 12, which cross-section shape is changed from a torus to a circle little by little. Next, the chamber 12 is connected to the chamber 13 having circular cross-section shape, i.e. a cylindrical geometry.<br>
For example, the cross-section shapes of the intermediate conversion chamber 8 and the reaction chamber 10 shown in Figure 1(a) are as follows. • Intermediate conversion chamber 8<br>
The upstream end corresponds to the downstream end of the combustion<br>
chamber 7, and which cross-section shape is a circle. The downstream end corresponds to the upstream end of the reaction chamber 10, and which cross-section shape is a torus.<br>
•	Reaction chamber 10<br>
The upstream end corresponds to the downstream end of the intermediate conversion chamber 8, which cross-section shape is a torus. It converges in the similar figure toward the downstream, and the convergence angle is same as that of the convergence in the intermediate conversion chamber 8 to the feedstock introduction chamber 10 in Figure 1(a).<br>

Physical and chemical properties of the carbon blacks so obtained were measured as follows.<br>
(1)	CTAB surface area<br>
This value was measured according to the D method of JIS K 6217, 1997, section 8, and indicated as specific surface area (m2/g) per unit weight.<br>

(3)	Analysis for the aggregate size of the carbon black measured by the centrifugal<br>
sedimentation method<br>
As a measuring device, the high-speed disk centrifugal ultra-fine particle size analyzer (device name: BI-DCP, supplied by BROOKHAVEN INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION) was used. A small amount of surfactant (Nonidet P-40, CAS No.9036-19-5, supplied by Nacalai Tesque Inc.) was added to a carbon black which was dried according to JIS K 6218. The mixture was kneaded well to be paste, and mixed with 20 volume % ethanol aqueous solution to prepare dispersion<br>
having 200 mg/l of carbon black concentration.   Then, the dispersion was treated with ultrasonic wave homogenizer to prepare the sample.<br>
A rotational frequency of the measuring device was set at 8000 rpm. 10.0 ml of spin liquid (pure water, 24°C), 1.0 ml of buffer liquid (20 volume % ethanol aqueous solution, 24°C), and 0.5 ml of carbon black dispersing liquid (24°C) were injected successively to the device, then measurement was started. The distribu-tion carve was plotted with the lapse in course of time from the addition of the carbon black dispersing liquid against a absorbance obtained by this measurement, and the stokes correspondent diameters corresponding to each of times (t) were calculated by the equation (1);<br>
(Equation 1 Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>
η is the solvent viscosity (mPa-s), ω is the disk rotational frequency (rpm), ∆ p is the difference of the density between the carbon black particle and the solvent (g/cm3), Rd is the radius of the measuring point of the absorbance from the center of the disk (cm), Ri is the radius of the injection point of the carbon black dispersion, and t is the time (minute).<br>
Explaining the definition of half-value width (∆D50) of distribution curve and mode diameter (Dst)<br>
Stokes correspondence diameter at the largest frequency value in distribution curve is defined as Dst mode diameter (nm). The difference in stokes correspondent diameter between 2 points which corresponds to 50% frequency of the largest frequency value (half-value width) is defined as ∆ D50(nm).<br>

Effects of the invention<br>
The carbon black produced by the carbon black reactor according to the present invention exhibits the same characteristics, especially the distribution of the aggregate size, as one produced by pilot-scale reactor, while its production scale is increased to the level of that of the reactor actually operated. If more increased output is desired, it is readily achieved by lengthening the long sides of the cross-section shape of the feedstock-introduction part with keeping the length of the short sides constant. Thus, the carbon black reactor according to the present invention can produce the high performance carbon black in large-scale at low cost.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br><br>
1.	A carbon black reactor comprising;<br>
a combustion zone for generating a hot combustion gas by burning a mixture of<br>
a hydrocarbon fuel and an oxygen containing gas,<br>
a reaction zone for producing a carbon black by contacting said hot combustion<br>
gas with a feedstock introduced in a plurality of divided flows to thermally<br>
decompose and/or incompletely combust the feedstock, and<br>
a quench zone for stopping a carbon black growth reaction by injecting a<br>
coolant to said carbon black containing flow, and<br>
these three zones are arrayed laterally in order,<br>
wherein the cross-section  shape of the feedstock introduction part in  said<br>
reaction zone is not a circle, a polygon or a combination of more than three lines<br>
and more than three curves.<br>
2.	The carbon black reactor as claimed in claim 1, wherein a ratio of a longest axis of said cross-section shape to a shortest axis thereof is 1.5-20.<br>
3.	A carbon black reactor as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cross-section shape is formed of a combination of curved line and curved line.<br>
4.	A carbon black reactor as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cross-section shape is formed of a combination of curved lines and two straight lines.<br>
5.	A carbon black reactor as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cross-section shape is an ellipse.<br></td>
