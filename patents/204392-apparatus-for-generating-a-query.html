COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
APPARATTUS FOR GENERATING A QUERY<br>
PLATINUM TECHNOLOGY,   INC.,   of One  Computer Associates  Plaza, Islandia, New York 11749, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a apparatus for generating a query.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to querying data in a database and more specifically to a method of selecting appropriate query parameters to efficiently perform a query.<br>
Databases commonly store data in one or more fact tables representing instance data of some nature, along with dimension tables defining anributes for data in the fact tables. As shown in Figure 1, the fact tables have columns which each represent an element of a particular dimension associated v/ith the instance in question, and one or more measure columns containing data relating to that particular instance. Often, the measures will be values which can be aggregated in some way if records in the fact data are grouped together. For example, the entries might be summed or averaged. However, this might not be the case, and "measure data" in certain measure columns in the fact tables might just be an arbitrary string or other type of value which cannot be aggregated. This invention operates on any type of fact table as long as it is related to one or more dimensions with attributes.<br>
Dimensions represent a bounded set of entities within a class, each with one or more attributes which can be classified in a common manner. A dimension is normally represented in a dimension table with one or more or columns in the table uniquely identifying each entity in the dimension, known as the key value or values. Key values will often be arbitrary identifiers given to the entities in the dimension to uniquely identify them. Other columns in the table, possibly including one of the key columns, provide different anributes of each of the entities. These<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/DS99/25939<br><br>
attribute values can be used to group me entries in the dimension table at different levels, and to extract or aggregate data from the fact tables according to their attributes.<br>
For space efficiency, and to avoid redundancy that could lead to inconsistencies in the database, only the key values for each dimension are stored in the fact data tables. It should be noted that internal representations with a one to one correspondence with the key values in the dimension in question could be stored in the fact tables if more efficient. These would never be seen by the user. In such a case the internal representation can be considered the key value for the purposes of this discussion.<br>
Query examples in this patent application will be given in the SQL language as this is by far the most prevalent query language used today. However, it will be apparent that the invention described herein can be implemented equally effectively with other query languages.<br>
If a query is to be performed on the data in the database using the attribute values requested by the user, the dimension tables have to be included in the query, as in the following example:<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact, diml, dim2, dim3<br>
WHERE<br>
diml.key 1 = fact.keyl AND<br>
dim2.key2 = fact.key2 AND<br>
dim3.key3 = fact.key3 AND<br>
diml.artrl in (artrvalll, artrvall2	attrvallN) AND<br>
dim2.artr2 in (attrval21, attrval22	a'ttrval2P) AND<br>
dim3.attr3 in (attrval31, attrval32, .... attrval3Q);<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT7US99/25939<br><br>
In this type of query, the tables specified in the query are joined together on any common fields in each of the tables. In the above example, the key 1 field is common to both the diml table<br>
anfd the fact table. The key2 field is common to both the dim2 table and the fact table The kev3<br><br>
field is common to both the dim3 table and the fact table.<br>
Using such a join, an entry is created in the output table for all combinations of entries in both of the two joined tables where the joined field is the same in each table. The joined field only appears once in the output joined table. For example, joining the two tables shown in Figures 2A and 2B results in the output table shown in Figure 2C.<br>
However, if an initial mapping of the attribute values selected in each dimension is made onto the key values in that dimension, it is not necessary to join the dimension tables with the fact table in the query, as all the necessary information is in the fact table. For example, the query might read as follows:<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact<br>
WHERE<br>
fact.keyl in (valll, val12	vallN) AND<br>
fact.key2 in (val21, val22	val2P) AND<br>
fact.key3 in (val31, val32	val3Q);<br>
This will often be much more efficient than the equivalent attribute logic query, depending on how the database handles the query, because the dimension tables do not need to be included in the query. Furthermore, a database engine might be able to handle key values much more efficiently than attributes due to various optimizations.<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/25939<br><br>
Databases might be optimized for example by indexing the fact table by key value in each dimension. The appropriate fact data to include in the resultant data set can then be very quickly found by scanning through the entries for each key in the index, as the indexes associated with a particular key are arranged consecutively.<br>
If such an index based optimizing scheme is used by the database, the following type of query will often be more advantageous to use, even when querying on key values:<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact, diml, dim2, dim3<br>
WHERE<br>
diml.keyl=fact.keyl AND<br>
dim2.key2 = fact.key2 AND<br>
dim3.key3 = fact.key3 AND<br>
fact.keyl in(valll, val12	vallN) AND<br>
fact.key2 in (val21, val22	val2P) AND<br>
fact.key3 in (val31, val32	val3Q);<br>
Regardless of what query logic is used by current database querying tools, they all use the same transformations from the request into the appropriate SQL query, regardless of the number of entries which will be searched for using the query logic selected. For example, in some situations, selections made, especially at higher levels in dimensions, result in a large number of records from a dimension table matching selection criteria. For example, one might ask for all the stock funds of all the mutual funds on the market. In fact, there might be hundreds of dimension entries matching the selection criterion. If the database querying tool is automatically set up to transform the selected dimension attribute entries into key values in the fund dimension, the dimensions would be searched to find the key values matching the selection criteria. The entries in question would then be added to the query using an "IN" list, as shown above. A problem<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/2S939<br><br>
arises when the number of key values gets very large. Most database systems impose a limit on the number of values in a single "IN" list, and the query tool therefore has to split the query into a number of queries, searched for in the database. Furthermore, even if the dimensions are not indexed, it might actually take longer to perform a query with a significant number of key values using onJy the fact table than to perform the query using the few attribute values queried and introducing the dimensions into the query. For example, it might be almost as quick for a database engine to look up an attribute value the associated dimension table and check to see if it matches as it would to see if a key value matches. If there are significantly more key values in the equivalent query than the number of attribute values it would almost certainly be quicker to look up the attribute values in the associated dimension, than to check all the key values to see if one of them matches.<br>
It can-be seen that a query tool is required that can choose between alternative query structures depending on the actual attributes queried.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method of generating queries from data requests involving attributes from one or more dimensions, wherein the corresponding key values for the attributes are ascertained, and a decision is then made as to whether to use attribute logic or key value logic in the query depending on the number of key values and attributes necessary to perform the query.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A specific embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 3-4.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, a query generator 20 is provided as an object on an application server 2. The query generator accepts external requests and generates SQL queries therefrom. These SQL queries are then sent to a database engine 4 which retrieves the requested data from a database 6. The returned data is then sent from the database engine back to the application server and either returned to the requestor, or processed and sent elsewhere, for example to a display server 10.<br><br>
WO 00/28439	PCT/US99/25939<br>
The application server also stores replicas 12 of the dimensions stored in the database relating to the fact data which is to be retrieved. When a request involving one or more attributes is received by the query generator, the query generator searches through the dimension entries and identifies all the key values required. This could also be done using queries to the database server, but would be much more inefficient.<br>
The query generator 20 then decides how the query should be generated using the following logic, which is represented as a flowchart in Figure 4.<br>
For each dimension, if the number of key values is below a certain empirically determined threshold, it is deemed likely to be more efficient to simply compare the key values to the values in the fact table to obtain the results of the query. For the system on which this embodiment has been implemented by the applicants, an ideal value for this threshold was found to be 30. The query generated in this case does not include the dimensions and is simply made on the fact data (referred to as a "without" query with respect to this dimension, as the dimension is not required). For example, the following query might be. generated.<br>
SELECT fact.key 1, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact<br>
WHERE<br>
fact.keyl in (vail 1, vall2	vallN) AND<br>
. . <br>
However, if the number of keys exceeds the certain predetermined threshold, the query generated will vary depending on whether or not there is an index to die dimension for the fact table.<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/25939<br><br>
As discussed above, if the dimension is indexed, a key value from that dimension can very quickly be mapped onto appropriate entries in the fact table incorporating the key value.<br>
If the dimension key is indexed, a comparison is performed to see if the number of key values which will appear in the query exceeds the number of anribute values multiplied by a certain predetermined constant A, also developed empirically. For the system on which this embodiment has been implemented by the applicants, an ideal value for this threshold was found to be 30, although it should be noted that this value is not related to the threshold value discussed above.<br>
If the number of key values exceeds this value, attribute logic is deemed likely to be more efficient and an attribute query is generated. For example, a "with join" query including the following terms might be generated. The term "with join" refers to the fact that a join is performed between the fact table and the dimension table in question as discussed with reference to Figures 2A-2C. It should be noted that all attribute based queries are "with join" queries with respect to that dimension, because the attribute values cannot be ascertained without recourse to the dimension table.<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact, diml<br>
WHERE<br>
diml.keyl = fact.keyl AND<br>
diml.attrl in (attrvalll, attrvall2, .... attrvallN);<br>
However, if the number of key values does not exceed the number of anribute values multiplied by the constant A, a key value based "with join" query is generated including the dimension in the query, using the optimized indexing of the database engine. The query might include the following terms:<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/2S939<br><br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2. fact.key3. fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact, diml<br>
WHERE<br>
dim 1.key 1 = fact.keyl AND<br>
fact.keyl in (vail 1, vall2	vallN) AND...;<br>
If the dimension in question is not indexed, there will be less of an advantage using the key values, if any advantage at all. For example, it might be almost as quick for a database engine to look up an attribute value in the associated dimension table and check to see if it matches, as it would to see if a key value matches. Therefore, in this case, a simple comparison of the number of key values to the number of attribute values is made, rather than going to the lengths of establishing an empirical coefficient. However, such a coefficient could be used if appropriate, depending on the database engine.<br>
If the number of key values is greater than the number of attribute values which would be used in the query for that dimension, an attribute "with join" query is used for that dimension in the query. Otherwise, a keys "without join" query is used for that dimension, as there is no advantage to including the dimension in the search because it is not indexed.<br>
This selection algorithm is repeated for every dimension, and the query is then generated appropriately and forwarded to the database query engine.<br>
Of course, depending on the different properties of the query in each of the dimensions, different joins might be made in each dimension. Some dimensions might be included in the query, and others not. Furthermore, some of the dimensions might include attribute logic and others not. For example, the following complete query might be generated, with the first dimension and third dimensions being included in the query, the first using key value logic, and the second using attribute value logic:<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT7US99/25939<br><br>
SELECT fact.keyl. fact.key2. fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.2<br>
FROM fact, diml, dim3<br>
WHERE<br>
diml.key 1 = fact.keyl AND<br>
dim3.key3 = fact.key3 AND<br>
diml.key 1 in (vail 1, vall2	vallN) AND...;<br>
fact.key2 in (va!21, val22, ..., val2P) AND...;<br>
dim2.anr3 in(attrval31, aurval32	attrva3Q);<br>
Certain requests are more complex than the cases described thus far. For example, "multiple keeps" requests occur when a user makes multiple separate selections ("keeps") from a dimension. The query generated in this case needs to use OR logic in the where clause to model this situation. For example, assume that a user made multiple "keeps" when selecting from dimension diml. The first keep involved attributes attrl and attr2 while the second keep involved attributes attr3 and attr4. The generated query should be as follows:<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.m2, fact.m3<br>
FROM fact, dimlWHEREdiml.keyl = fact.keylAND<br>
	(diml.attrl in (attrvalll, ..attrvallN) AND<br>
diml.attr2 in (attrval21, .. attrval2N)) OR<br>
(diml.attr3 in (attrval31, .... attrvaBN) AND<br>
diml.attr4 in (attrval41	attrval4N) )<br><br>
AND fact.key2 in (val21, val22	val2N)<br>
AND fact.key3 in (val31, val32	val3N)<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/25939<br><br>
According to this embodiment, with queries of this kind, each attribute referenced in the attribute based query is counted as an attribute in the above algorithm. The equivalent query using key values will be of the same format described earlier, with a simple "IN" list, and there is therefore no added complexity to establishing the number of key values.<br>
A yet more complex scenario occurs when the user selects a measure that involve a "base" calculation (i.e. "sth" like share). This typically calls for a "behind the scenes" additional selection(s) from the given dimension. The keys logic resolves this situation by additional key values in the list of keys for the dimension. The attribute logic needs to perform an additional OR on top of the syntax related to the multiple "keeps". Let's assume that (on top of the multiple "keeps" from the example above) the user selects a "base" calculation that calls for additional selection in dimension diml, let say from attribute artr5. The query will look as.follows:<br>
SELECT fact.key 1, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.m2, fact.m3<br>
FROM fact, diml<br>
WHERE<br>
diml. key 1 = fact.key 1<br>
AND<br>
(diml.attrl in (attrvalll, ..attrvallN) AND diml.attr2 in (attrval21, .. attrva!2N)) OR<br>
( diml.attr3 in (attrvatfl	attrval3N) AND<br>
diml.attr4 in (attrva!41, .... attrvaWN))<br>
OR<br>
diml.attr5 in (attrva51	attrval5N)<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/25939<br><br>
AND fact.key2 in (val21. val22, .... val2N)<br>
Such a situation is dealt with in a similar manner to the "multiple keeps" scenario.<br>
It should be noted that a star join option can be used in conjunction with the attributes logic option, with some dimensions using a star join based on an indexed dimension, and some dimensions using the standard attribute logic. Assuming that a simple case of attribute logic is used for dimension diml, the query might look as follows:<br>
SELECT fact.keyl, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.m2, fact.m3 FROM fact, diml, dim2, dim3 WHERE<br>
diml.keyl = fact.keyl AND dim2.key2 = fact.key2 AND dim3.key3 = fact.key3 AND<br>
(diml.attrl in (attrvalll, ..attrvallN) AND diml.attr2 in (attrval21, .. attrva!2N)<br>
AND diml.attrN in (attrvalNl, ... attrvalNN)<br><br>
AND dim2.key2 in (val21, val22	val2N)<br>
AND dim3.key3 in (val31, val32	val3N)<br>
In the system of this embodiment, User profiles allow to subset the data returned to the user. The user will have access to only those records the user is privileged to see. Base uses a filtering mechanism to accomplish that. From the point of view of the attribute logic, the user profile is a set of dimension selections that determine the subset of data the user can access.<br><br>
WO 00/28439<br><br>
PCT/US99/25939<br><br>
Assuming that the user profile for dimension diml defines that the user can access only those records where the values of attribute attrK are in the given list of values, the query generated by the attribute logic might look as follows:<br>
SELECT fact.key 1, fact.key2, fact.key3, fact.ml, fact.m2, fact.m3 FROM fact, diml WHEREdiml.keyl = fact.keyl AND(<br>
diml.ami in (attrvalll, ..attrvallN)<br>
AND diml.attr2 in (attrval21, .. attrvaHN)<br>
AND diml.attrK in (attrvalKl	attrvalKN)<br>
)<br>
AND fact.key2 in (val21, val22, .... val2N)<br>
AND fact.key3 in (vaI31, val32	val3N)<br>
Each attribute value mentioned is treated as a single attribute value in the algorithm of this embodiment of the invention.<br>
The attribute logic is not impacted by partitioned fact sets. In the case of physical partitions, each partition is defined using an aggregate table. Typically, a query is issued against each partition using the logic described.<br>
While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in me art that changes and modifications can be made without departure from the invention in its broader aspects. Various features of the present invention are set forth in the following claims.<br><br>
