RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is related to copending U.S. Provisional Application No{s). 60/154.701. ilied on September 14. 1999, and U.S. Provisional Application, Attorney Docket No. PKlZ-018-2. filed September 12, 2000. the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The development of the tetracycline antibiotics was the direct result of a systematic screening of soil specimens collected from many parts of the world for evidence of microorganisms capable of producing bacteriocidal and/or bacteriostatic compositions. The first of these novel compounds was introduced in 1948 under the name chlorteiracycline. Two years later oxytetracycline became available. The detailed elucidation of the chemical structure of these agents confirmed their similarity and furnished the analytical basis for the production of a third member of this group in 1952, tetracycline. By 1957, a new family of tetracycline compositions characterized chemically by the absence of the position 6 ring-attached OH group present in the earlier compositions was prepared and became publicly available in 1967; and minocycline was in use by 1972. Individual letracycline-type agents are structurally compared within Table I below, with reference made the following structural formula:<br>

More recent research efforts have focused on developing new tetracycline antibiotic compositions effective under varying therapeutic condhions and routes of administration; and for developing new tetracycline analogues which might prove to be equal or more effective then the originally introduced tetracycline families beginning in 1948. Representative of such developmenis include U.S. Patent Nos. 3.957,980; 3,674,859; 2,980,584; 2,990,331; 3,062,717; 3,557,280; 4,018,889; 4.024,272; 4,126,680; 3,454,697; and 3,165,531. It will be understood that these issued patents are merely representative of the range of diversity of investigations seeking tetracycline and tetracycline analogue compositions which are pharmacologically active.<br>
Historically, soon after their initial development and introduction, the tetracyclines, regardless of specific formulation or chemical stmcture. were found to be highly effective pharmacologically against rickettsiae; a number of gram-positive and gram-negati\'e bacteria; and the agents responsible for lymphogranuloma venereum, inclusion conjunctivitis, and psittacosis. Hence, tetracyclines became knovm as "broad spectrum" antibiotics. With the subsequent establishment of their m vUro antimicrobial activity, effectiveness in experimental infections, and pharmacological properties, the tetracyclines as a class rapidly became widely used for therapeutic purposes. However, this widespread use of tetracyclines for both major and minor illnesses and diseases led directly in the emergence of resistance to these aniibiolics even among highly susceptible bacterial species both commensal and pathogenic - as for sxamplQ pneumococci and Salmonella.  The rise of tetracyclinc-resistani organisms has resulted in a general decline in use of tetracyclines and tetracycline analogue compositions as antibiotics of choice.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel chemistries which allow for the production of substituted tetracycline compounds including substituted tetracycline compounds which exhibit<br><br>
significant antibacterial activity. The methods disclosed herein utilize reactive tetracycline-based precursor compounds, reactive organic substiiuent precursors and transition metals or transition metal catalysts under conditions such that a tetracycline compound substituted wilh the desired organic substiiuent is formed.

"Transition metal catalyst" is an art-recognized term which includes transition metals and catalysts comprising a transition metal, e.g., including elements 21 through 29. 39 through 47, 57 through 79, and 89 on. Exemplary transition metal catalysts include CuCI;- copper (I) triflaie, copper thiophene chloride, palladium (II) chloride, organopalladium catalysts such as palladium acetate, PdCPPhj)^, Pd(AsPh3)4, PdCl,(PhCN),.

Other transition metal calalvsts include those containing metals such as rhodium (e.g. rhodium (11) acetate and Rhft(CO)|J. iron, iridium, chromium, zirconium, and nickel. A skilled artisan will be able to select the appropriate transition metal catalyst to perform the desired reaction, based on the existing literattire (see. for example, Lipshutz, B.H. Org. Read. 1992, 41:135. incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
"Reactive organic substituent precursor" includes organic substituents having a reactive group that allows for addition to the reactive tetracyciine-based precursor compound as disclosed herein.

The invention aiso provides in another aspect a method for preparing substituted tetracycline compounds, desirably 7, 9 or 13-substituted compounds, and, in another aspect, tetracycline compounds prepared by this method.   The compounds can be prepared as generally depicted in the Schemes set forth hereinbelow. In the discussions of the Schemes, the various substituent groups are the same as defined above; "R" includes R. and R,. Also, for purposes of exemplification only, doxycycline is depicted as the "base" tetracycline compound, although ii will be understood that a wide variety of tetracycline compounds can be employed in the same marmer. For example, the base tetracycline compound substituted at the 7-. 9-and/or 13-posilions suitably may be oxyietracycline; chlortetracycline; demeclocycHne; doxycycline; chelocardin: minocycline; rolitetracycline; lymecycline; sancycUne; meihacyciinei apicycline; clomocycline; guamecycline; meglucycline: mepylcycline; penimepicycline: pipacycline; etamocycline; penimocyciine, serai-synthetic intermediates thereof, and the like.<br>
Tetracycline compounds of the present invention may readily be prepared by the methods outlined in accordance with the following schemes. Scheme I refers to the preparation of tetracycline compounds which may be prepared from a starting compound of formula ]_. a<br><br>
clinically useful tetracycline antibiotic named doxycycline. It has been found that 6-(substiiuted)-5-hydroxy-6-deoxytetracyclines (U R,=CH,. doxycycline) or their mineral acid sails can be dissolved in concentrated acids, e.g., H,SOj as an appropriate solvent, and reacted with nitrating reagents such as sodium or potassium nitrate to produce 7 and 9-nitro tetracycline derivatives (2, 3). These compounds are separated by a variet)' of techniques, with the preferred method being preparative HPLC on C.g-reverse phase silica gel with a binary gradient system comprising either phosphate-buffered ethylene diamine letraacetic acid, sodium salt (EDTA) with a methanol gradient or a gradient of acetonitrile over 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. These isolated compounds are readily reduced to the amine functional group using typical reducing reagents such as hydrogen with transition metal catalysts, platinum oxide, palladium on carbon, or similar to produce the 7-NH2 and 9-NH, tetracyclines (4. 5) in good yield. Alternatively, 7-NH, tetracyclines (doxycycline) can be prepared (such as detailed in U. S. Patent 3,483.251, incorporated herein by reference) via a reductive alkylaiion of 7-(N,N dicarboxybenzyloxyhydrazino)tetracyclines.<br>
Compounds possessing the anilino flinctional groups can undergo a diazotization reaction with nitrous acid (HONO) or organic agents such as buty! nitrite readily forming the diazonium salts, (such as the hydrochloride or tetrafluoroborate salts) (6. 7) in nearly quantitative yield. This reactive tetracycline-based precursor compound (6, 7) as a suitable diazonium salt form, can now chemically complex with organopalladium catalysts and species that resuhs in carbon-carbon bond formation between the tetracycline reactant intermediate and the reactive organic substituent precursor of choice. Transition metal catalysts such as CuCl, (the Meerwin reaction) as well as palladium catalysts such as palladium chloride, palladium acetate or other catalysts mentioned above, with palladium acetate being preferred, are used to produce the 7 and 9 substituted position derivatives of tetracyclines. The reactions are typically run in polar solvents such as DMSO, water, and alcohols with trace mineral acids (HCl, 0,1%) to react with substituted or unsubstituted aromatic or heteroaromatic, alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl substructures producing the desired substituted compounds. Non-polar solvents may also be used in which to run the reactions.<br>
It is known that transition metal halides. such as palladium and copper halides. react with arenediazonium sahs to form complexes capable of further reactions. Transition metal halides as catalysts facilitate carbon-car t^^^ri hnnH rnmiarlnn 1. in n r^iHi^al nviHrnlnn-roHiif-Tinn<br><br>
addition of carbon substructures (double bonds and other structures possessing 71-bonds) to the electron deficient nitrogen diazonium reactive group.   For example, palladium catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formation occurs readily when a suitable alkene in the reacting system forms reactive coordination complexes. This is followed by insertion into carbon sigma bonds to give a temary complex. Catalysts such as palladium are cycled and regenerated via, for example, a p-hydride eiimination, thereby forming a carbon-carbon covalent bond. Using these conditions, molecular substructures possessing a 7i-bond system, such as alkenes or acrylic acid esters or any one of the many other compounds possessing a double bond, are readily arylated with reactive letracycline-based precursor compounds, e.g., tetracycline arenediazonium salts. Other transition metal catalyzed reactions such as transmetallation and insertion reactions, e.g., of carbon monoxide) are also contemplated (see. Hegedus, supra for examples of transition metal catalyzed reactions).<br>
Homogeneous catalysis of carbon-carbon bond formation is possible using palladium complexes and suitable reactive species. Tetracyclines, e.g.. doxycyciine or minocycline, are used to generate the reactive diazonium functional group within the D ring while the reactive addend is available from structurally diverse chemical families.<br>
Therefore, reactive letracycline-based precursor compounds such as tetracycline arenediazonium salts, i.e., having reactive functional groups at, e.g., positions 7 and 9 of the tetracycline molecule similarly can be reacted with alkenes, substituted alkenes. vinyl monomers, aromatic and heteroaromatic reactive groups (unsubstituted or substituted) in the presence of the appropriate transition metal catalyst to produce 7-(substituted) and 9-(substiiuied) tetracyclines (8, 9, Scheme I) in good yield. 7-position substituted tetracycline 9-diazonium salts, for example (Scheme II), produced by the reaction sequence of minocycline (W) nitration to the 9-NO, derivative (n_), followed by catalytic reduction to the 9-NH, derivative (12) followed by diazoiisation (V3)~ may also be reacted with double bond compounds such as olefins and reactive products and reagents producing minocycline derivatives of formula (II) (\A, Scheme II).<br>
In an embodiment, reaction products of formulas I and II may be further derivatized and reacted with reagents as depicted in Schemes lll-VIi, thus acting as intermediates for making other compounds not readiiy obtained otherwise, 9-alkcny\ substituted doxyc&gt;xlmes (8, 9) of<br><br>
formula I may undergo hydrogenation of the 9-alk:enyl group with platinum or palladium catalysts on carbon under low pressure hydrogen to form the 9-alkyl derivatives of doxycycline (il-1^' Scheme III). Similarly, 9-alkenyl derivatives of minocycline i\A) may also be reduced to the alkyl derivatives using catalytic hydrogenation methods as shown in Scheme IV (17),<br>
7 or 9 derivatives of doxycycline of formula I (Schemes I and III) may also react with carboxylic acids while dissolved in strong acids such as anhydrous hydrogen fluoride or methanesulphonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid to produce the 5-esier derivatives of 7 and 9 substituted doxycyclines (j^, j^. Scheme V).<br>
7 or 9 derivatives of doxycycline of formula I (Schemes I, III and V) may also form Mannich base derivatives by the reaction of the 7 or 9 derivatives with formaldehyde and an appropriate base (pyrrolidine) to produce Maimich base addition products (20. 21^, Scheme VI).<br>
9 derivatives of minocycline of formula II (^, Scheme II) may also form Mannich base derivatives by the reaction of the 7 or 9 derivative with formaldehyde and an appropriate base (pyrrolidine) to produce the Marmich base addition products (22, Scheme VII).<br>
Tetracycline diazonium reactive functional groups generated in Scheme I may also be reacted with carbon monoxide in alcohols in the presence of transition metal catalysts such as palladium acetate to produce 7 and 9-carboxylic acid derivatives (23, 24) in good yield which readily esterified to produce 9 position tetracycline esters (25, 26, Scheme VIII).<br>
Minocycline diazonium reactive functional groups generated in Schemes U may also be reacted with carbon monoxide in alcohols in the presence of transition metal catalysts such as palladium acetate to produce the 9-carboxylic acid derivative (2) in good yield which is readily esterified to produce 9 position minocycline carboxylic acid esters (28, Scheme IX).<br>
Other reactions are possible with 7 and 9 aminotetracyclines via a diazonium functional group. Tetracycline arene diazonium salts also react with active methylene compounds such as esters of aceioacetate, and derivatives thereof, active aromatic rings and unsubstituted and substituted olefins, acetylenes, substituted acetylenes, arylethyienes, styrenes, conjugated dienes, isoprenes. vinyl ethers, a . p-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, ary! vinyl and arylisoprenyt ketones, quinones, a , p-unsaturated acids and their derivatives. Ail of the multiple bond compounds are readily couoled to arenediazonium salts, as well as nucleoohiles.<br><br>
Position 7 and the 7 and 9 reactive tetracycline-based precursor compounds (halogenated derivatives of tetracyclines as shown in Scheme X) also produce 7 and 9 derivatives of tetracyclines. Aromatic substitution reactions by iodination, bromination or chlorination to produce the 7 and 9 halogen derivatives of doxycycline (29, 30) or sancycltne (31, 32) in good yield by reactions described, e.g.. by HIavka, J.J., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 84, 1961, 1426-1430. Position 7 and 9 halogenated derivatives of the tetracyclines may be further coupled with iodoalkenes or iodoarenes in N-methylpyrrolidinone with transition metal catalysts such as copper thiophene chloride or others to produce the position 7 or 9 derivatives of doxycycline (33. 34) or position 7 or 9 derivatives of doxycycline (3^, 36) in good yield.<br>
Position 13-derivatives of tetracyclines may be prepared via the reaction of phenylboronic acids with the exocyclic double bond of methacycline (37) (Scheme XI) in alcohols such as methanol, in the presence of palladium chloride or other transition metal catalysts to produce the 13-phenyl derivatives of methacycline in good yield (38).<br>

In scheme I. doxycycline is dissolved in cold concentrated sulfuric acid and an equiv'aient of potassium nitrate is added. The reaction temperature was maintained in the range 0 to 5°C for a period of 1 to 3 hrs, producing 7 and 9-nitro-6-substituted-5-hydroxy tetracyclines of formula IV, These intermediates, with suitable chemically reactive functionality, can be reacted with a broad range of reducing agents such as PtO, or hydrogen and palladium or platinum catalysts producing compounds of general formula IV. The diazonium salts of the 7 and 9 amino derivatives are produced by the action of nitrites (sodium nitrite, butyl nitrite or equivalent) and the intermediate used without further purification.<br>
