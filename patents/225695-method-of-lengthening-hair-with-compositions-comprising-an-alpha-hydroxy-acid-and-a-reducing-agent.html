The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD  OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to hair treatment compositions. The compositions are particularly suitable to style hair  and in particular to lengthen hair.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
For centuries long hair has been a desirable attribute. To achieve this straightening devices are sold that mechanically lengthen and straighten the hair, a selection of such devices are disclosed in EP 0 511 892 and W012/32381 An alternative to the above mechanical approach to lengthen the hair is to stimulate hair growth using chemical hair growth stimulants, such products are disclosed in EP 0 897 712 and WO92/07877.<br>
Skin care compositions comprising ascorbic acid and V-hydroxy acids are described in WO 02/055054, WO 01/066105 and US 5 629 004.<br>
The use of ascorbic acid as a neutralising formulation for hair has been disclosed in US 5 051 252.<br>
US 6 482 808 discloses compositions for restructuring keratin comprising ascorbic acid/salts, V-hydroxy acids are used to produce the free acids.<br><br>
The present application discloses formulations and processes for lengthening hair.  The invention has the further advantages that it prevents the hair frizzing and increasing in volume.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it produces a composition that is stable on storage.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method of lengthening hair comprising the step of applying to the hair a non-oxidative hair treatment composition comprising: i)  an α -hydroxy acid, its salt or mixtures thereof and; ii)  a non-thio based reducing agent.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that reducing agent and alpha-hydroxy acid combinations are particularly useful in styling hair, lengthening hair and increasing high humidity style retention.<br>
In the context of the present invention the term non-oxidative means that the composition does not include ingredients that oxidise the hair, in particular the composition does not contain agents that perm the hair (irreversibly alter the structure) or irreversibly colour the hair.<br><br>

Examples of the invention are illustrated by a number, comparative examples are illustrated by a letter.<br>
Examples<br><br>
The examples were repeated at pH 7.0<br>
Experimental Methodology<br>
Set of swatches of hair were made from naturally curly hair. The initial length of all the swatches were measured before the treatment by taking a photograph and using a ruler (L0) .<br><br>
The swatches were cleaned using a base shampoo. The treatment protocol was as follows. All swatches were treated twice 10%w/w of a shampoo by massaging the shampoo into the hair for 30 seconds and then rinsing for 30 seconds. Thereafter, 20%w/w of a conditioner was applied by massaging it to the hair for 60 seconds, left for 90 seconds and then rinsing it for 60 seconds. Thereafter, the switches were treated with Examples 1 and A by massaging with 10%w/w for 3 minutes and then combed and left to dry at 20°C, 50RH for 3hours. At this stage the length of the swatches were measured (Li) .<br>
The switches were then exposed to 30°C, 80RH for 3hours. A final measurement of the length of the swatches was made.<br><br>
The Examples were placed in sealed test tubes and the stored at room temperature for 17 days.  On storage the Examples made at pH 7.0 had a very pungent odour, stronger than those at pH 3.8.<br><br>
