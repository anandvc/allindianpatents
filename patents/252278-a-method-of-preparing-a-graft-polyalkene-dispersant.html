DISPERSANT POLYALKENES<br>
This application claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application No. 60/523,959. filed on November 21,2003.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel functional monomers and dispersant polyalkenes comprising such monomers.<br>
The present invention further relates to low MW polyalkene backbones which have been grafted with ethytenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic mono-, bi~ and multi-functional monomer mixtures containing oxygen and nftrogen atoms.<br>
The present invention further relates to methods for manufacturing these novel monomers and the drspersant graft polyalkenes comprising such monomers.<br>
The present invention further relates to lubricating oil compositions containing the dispersant graft polyalkenes in amounts effective to function as dispersants and potentially as low MW viscosity index improvers.<br>
It is also contemplated that the molar proportions of the grafted mono, bi and multi-functional monomer to low MW polyalkene ratio may be 0.2:1. 0.5:1,1:1. 2:1,4:1 and as much as 8:1 of grafted monomer: moles polyalkene backbone.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel monomers and methods of making such   monomers. Such monomers may be used to prepare dispersants or dispersant viscosity index improvers (DVIIs). One aspect of the invention is the. preparation of a reaction product comprising one or more ethylenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic monomers having nitrogen and oxygen atoms. For example, the reaction product obtained by reacting maleic anhydride and Methylene tetramine. The reaction product is a mixture that contains, among other components, the mono-maleimide and corresponding amic acid of Methylene tetramine as well as the di-mafeimide and corresponding di-amic acid of Methylene tetramine. The graftable compounds of the reaction product are then grafted onto the low MW polyalkene using free radical initiators.<br>
The term "reaction product" as used in this specification refers to one or more compounds formed by the reaction of one, two or more reactants. Thus, it may include more than one chemical compound formed from the combination of the acylating agent and the amine, and in such instances, the term "reaction product" will be understood to refer to all such chemical compounds. The term "monomer" as used in this specification refers to the graftable. ethylenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compound(s) of the reaction product. The monomers may be mono-, bi-or multifunctional The graftable monomers) may, but need not, be recovered from the product mixture before carrying out the grafting reaction. The present method may also comprise the step of recovering one or more graftable compounds from the reaction product of the acylating agent and the amine.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the graft reaction product of a low MW polyalkene with an ethylenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic mono-, bi- or multifunctional monomer having from 3 to about SO carbon atoms in addition to nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The graft reaction product has a molar proportion of grafted monomer to polyalkene ratio of at least about 0.2:1, alternatively at least about 0.5:1, alternatively at least about 1:1, alternatively at least about 2:1, about 4:1, and as much as about 8:1.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is a method of making a dispersant or low MW viscosity index improver. According to this invention, a graftable monomer and a low MW polyalkene are provided. In some embodiments the low MW polyalkene has pendant unsaturated sites for grafting. Sufficient initiator is provided to graft the graftable monomer to the polyalkene. in some embodiments, grafting of the monomer onto the polyalkene backbone is carried out after reacting the low MW polyalkene with chlorine. In some embodiments, grafting of the monomer mixture onto the polyalkene backbone is carried using the "ene" reaction.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is the grafting of an ethylenically-unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic, hydrocarbon monomer containing both nitrogen and oxygen atoms onto a low MW polyalkene to form a dispersant moiety. To meet the objectives of the invention, it is preferable to react the polyalkene so that it contains at least about 0.2 mole of monomer per mole of polyalkene, or alternatively, 0.5 mole of monomer per mole, of polyalkene or, alternatively, 1 mole of monomer per mole of polyalkene or, alternatively, 2 moles of monomer per mole of polyalkene or,<br>
alternatively, 4 moles of monomer per mole of polyalkene or, alternatively, as much as 8 moles of monomer per mole of polyalkene, though the ratio is not critical for all aspects of the invention. The low MW polyalkene of the present invention (hereinafter alternatively referred to as the polyalkene or the low MW polyalkene) has a number average molecular weight of from about 300 to about 10000, preferably from about 600 to about 8000, or preferably from about 900 to about 5000 or more preferably from about 900 to about 4000. Particularly useful polyalkenes have number average molecular weights from about 1100 to about 3000.<br>
In carrying out the reaction, the polyalkene may be reacted as a neat material or dissolved in a solvent forming a solution. The graftable monomer and an initiator are added to the polyalkene. The graftable monomer and/or the initiator can be added gradually to the polyalkene or they can be added together or introduced successively or introduced as aliquots of reactants. The rate of addition of the graftable monomer can be from 0.1 % to 100% of the entire charge of monomer per minute. The rate of addition of the initiator can be from about 0.1 % to about 100% of the initiator charge per minute. The reaction temperature is maintained at a level which gives rise to a satisfactory reaction initiation rate. In one embodiment, the graftable monomer and the initiator are each added at a uniform, relatively slow rate during the reaction.<br>
The resulting graft polyalkene may have a monomer to polyalkene ratio of at least about 0.2:1, alternatively at least about 0.5:1, alternatively at least about 0.8:1, alternatively at least about 1:1, alternatively at least about 2:1, about 4:1, about 8:1, or even higher ratios.<br>
In principle, the graft product from the polyalkene may be made by melt-blending and reacting a mixture consisting essentially of the graftable monomer mixture; a low MW polyalkene; and an initiator. The reaction is carried out at a temperature and under conditions effective to graft the monomer mixture onto the polyalkene. The graft reaction product under such circumstances exhibits a monomer to polymer ratio of at least about 02:1, alternatively at least about, 0.5:1 alternatively at least about 0.8:1, alternatively at least about 1:1, alternatively at least about 2:1, about 4:1, and as much as about 8:1, or possibly higher ratios.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is lubricating oil comprising a hydrocarbon base oil and a grafted polyalkene as described above. The grafted polyalkene functions as a dispersant or as a dispersant with viscosity enhancing properties. The dispersant may<br>
be used in an amount which is from about 0.05% to 20% by weight solids of a lubricating oil composition.<br>

B.	Monomers for Use in the Preparation of Dfspersant Polyalkenes<br>
The monomers contemplated for use in the preparation of the dlspersant polyalkenes include ethytenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic mono-functional monomers described In U.S. Patent Application No. 10/444,548 discussed above as well as an ethytenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic bi-functional and higher monomers as described in this disclosure.<br>
C.	Initiators For Use  In The Preparation of Dispersant Polyalkenes<br>
Broadly, any free-radical initiator capable of operating under the conditions of the reactions as outlined in the present specification is contemplated for use herein. Representative initiators are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,146,489, column 4, lines 45-53, which is incorporated here by reference. Specific "peroxy" initiators contemplated herein include alkyl, diatkyl, and aryl peroxides, for example: di-t-butyl peroxide (abbreviated herein as "DTBP"), dicumyl peroxide, t-butyl cumyf peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, 216-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-buty3peroxy)hexane, and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexyne-3. Also contemplated are peroxyester and peroxyketal initiators, for example: t-butyiperoxy benzoate, t-amylperoxy benzoate, t-butylperoxy acetate, t-butyiperoxy benzoate, di-t-butyl diperoxyphthaiate, and t-butylperoxy isobutyrate. Also contemplated are hydroperoxides, for example: cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. Also contemplated are azo initiators, for example: 2-f-butylazo-2-cyanopropane, 2-t-butylazc-l-cyanocyclohexane, 2,2-azobls(2,4-dimethylpentane nitrite), 2,2*-azobis(2-methylpropane nitrite), 1,1-azobis(cyclohexanecart)onitrile), and azoisobutyronftrile (AIBN). Other similar materials are also contemplated such as, but not limited to, diacyi peroxides, ketone peroxides and peroxydicarbonates. It is also contemplated that combinations of more than one initiator, including combinations of different types of initiators, may be employed.<br>
Each such initiator commonly has a characteristic minimum reaction initiation temperature, above which it will readily initiate a reaction and below which the reaction<br>
will proceed more slowly or not at ail. Consequently, the minfrnum reaction temperature is commonly dictated by the selected initiator.<br>
D.     Methods for Preparation of Dispersant Polyalkene<br>
The grafting reaction may be carried out using one of several reaction<br>
methods, namely, (1) radical reaction Initiator to promote radical grafting, (2)<br>
chlorination procedure or (3) carrying out the "ene" reaction. The grafting reaction<br>
may be carried out in solution and a more detailed discussion of this method may be<br>
found in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/444,548 incorporated above by reference.<br>
 	When carrying out the radical initiated reaction, both the initiator and the<br>
monomer mixture may be used neat. Alternatively, they may be introduced info the polyalkene as a biend with appropriate solvents at a solids concentration ranging from about 15% to about 75%, for example, about 40%. The neat polyalkene fluid is introduced into a suitable well-stirred, heated reactor which can be purged or blanketed with an inerting gas, e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, or argon or otherwise isolated from the ambient air.<br>
The polyalkene is heated to the desired reaction temperature, chosen, in part, so that essentially all of the initiator is consumed during the time allotted for the reaction. For example, if DTBP (di-t-butyl peroxide) is used as the initiator, the reaction temperature should be greater than about 160°C. Since the various acceptable initiators have different optimum reaction temperatures, the choice of a particular initiator may require adjustment of the reaction temperature or, alternatively, adjustment of the reaction time, in order to insure that the reaction conditions are compatible with the choice of initiator.<br>
Consumption of initiator and reaction time are not the only determinants of the reaction temperature chosen, the temperature condition is also used to facilitate mixing and distribution of the reactant as well as maintaining fluidity of the polyalkene. Frequently, temperatures above 160°C will be employed.<br>
1.       Molar Proportion Of Monomer<br>
The contemplated proportions of the graftabte monomer to the polyalkene and reaction conditions are selected so that an effective percentage (ideally, most or all of the reactant charge) of the graftabfe monomer will graft onto the polyalkene, rather than<br>
forming dimeric, ofigorneric, or homopolymeric graft moieties or entire!/ independent homopolymers. The alternatively contemplated minimum mole ratios of the graftable monomer to the starting polyalkene are as follows:<br>
at least about 0.1 mote,<br>
alternatively at least about 0.2 moles,<br>
af tematively at least about 0.5 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 0.8 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 1 mole,<br>
alternatively at feast about 2 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 3 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 4 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 5 motes,<br>
alternatively at least about 6 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 7 moles,<br>
alternatively at least about 8 moles of the graftable monomer per mote of the starting polyalkene.<br>
A contemplated maximum molar proportion of the graftable monomer to the<br>
starting polyalkene may be desirable in several situations. For example, it may be preferable to select a contemplated maximum molar proportion of the graftable monomer to the starting polyalkene in order to facilitate manufacturing control of product quality.<br>
The graftable monomer may be introduced into the reactor all at once, in several discrete charges, or at a steady rate over an extended period. The desired minimum rate of addition of the graftable monomer mixture to the reaction mixture is selected from:<br>
at least about 0.1%,<br>
alternatively at least about 0.5%,<br>
alternatively at least about 1.0%,<br>
alternatively at least about 2.0%,<br>
 	alternatively at least about 5.0%,<br>
alternatively at least about 10%,<br>
alternatively at least about 20%,<br>
alternatively at least about 50%,<br>
alternatively at least about 100% of the necessary charge of graftable monomer mixture per minute. When added over time, the monomer can be added at an essentially constant rate, or at a rate which varies with time. Any of the above values can represent an average rate of addition or the minimum value of a rate which varies with tima<br>
The desired maximum rate of addition is selected from:<br>
at most about 0.5%,<br>
alternatively at most about 1.0%,<br>
alternatively at most about 2.0%,<br>
alternatively at most about 5.0%,<br>
alternatively at most about 20%,<br>
alternatively at most about 100% of the necessary charge of graftable monomer mixture per minute. Any of the above values can represent an average rate of addition or the maximum value of a rate which varies with time.<br>
The graftable monomer may be added as a neat liquid, in solid or molten form, or cut back with a solvent While it may be Introduced neat, it may be cut back with a solvent to avoid high localized concentrations of the monomer as it enters the reactor. In one embodiment, the monomer is diluted with a solvent The monomer can be diluted by at least about 1 times (50% concentration), alternatively at least about 5 times alternatively at least about 20 times, its weight or volume with a suitable solvent or dispersing medium,<br>
2.       Molar Proportion of Initiator<br>
The contemplated proportions of the initiator to the graftable monomer and the reaction conditions are selected so that at least many, and ideally, all of the monomer will graft directly onto the polyotefin, rather than forming dtmertc, oligomeric, or homopolymeric graft moieties or entirely independent homopolymers. The contemplated minimum molar proportions of the initiator to the graftable monomer mixture are from about 0.05:1 to about 2:1. No specific maximum proportion of the initiator is contemplated, though too much of the initiator may degrade the polyalkene.<br>
While the initiator may be added neat, in a preferred embodiment, it is introduced<br>
"cut-back" with solvent in order to avoid focalized regions of elevated concentration.<br>
The initiator can be added before, with or after the graftable monomer. For example, the Initiator may be added so that at any given time, the amount of unreacted initiator present is much iess than the entire charge, and preferably a small fraction of the entire charge. In one embodiment, the initiator may be added after substantially all the graftable monomer has been added, so there is an excess of both the graftable monomer and the polyolefin during essentially the entire reaction. In another embodiment, the initiator may be added along with the graftabie monomer, either at essentially the same rate (measured as a percentage of tne entire charge added per minute) or at a somewhat faster or slower rate, so there is an excess of polyolefin to unreacted initiator and unreacted monomer. For this embodiment, the ratio of unreacted initiator to unreacted monomer remains substantially constant during most of the reaction.<br>
The initiator may be introduced into the reactor in several (or, alternatively, many) discrete charges, or at a steady rate over an extended period. The desired minimum rate of addition of the initiator to the reaction mixture ranges from at least about 0.1% of the necessary charge of initiator per minute to alternatively at least about 100% of the necessary charge of initiator per minute. The initiator can be added at an essentially constant rate, or at a rate which varies with time. The above rates can represent an average rate of addition or the minimum value of a rate which varies with time.<br>
The desired maximum rate of addition of the initiator to the reaction mixture may vary from a maximum of at most about 0.1% of the necessary charge of initiator per minute to at about 100% of the necessary charge of initiator per minute. The above rates can represent an average rate of addition or the maximum value of a rate which varies with time.<br>
While the initiator can be added neat, it is preferably cut back with a solvent to avoid high localized concentrations of the initiator as it enters the reactor. In a preferred embodiment, it is substantially diluted with a process fluid. The initiator can be diluted by at least about 5 times, alternatively at least about 10 times, alternatively at least about 20 times, alternatively at least about 50 times its weight or volume with a suitable solvent or dispersing medium.<br>
3.      Procedure for Grafting Reaction<br>
After the reactants have been combined, the reaction mixture is preferably mixed with heating for an additional 2 to 120 minutes to complete the reaction. The time required for completion of the reaction can be determined experimentally, for example, by determining when the concentration of nitrogen or of monomer mixture in solution reaches a vafue at or approaching a minimum pre-established value.<br>
After the reaction has gone essentially to completion, the heat can be removed and the reaction product can be allowed to cool in the reactor with mixing. Alternatively, more aggressive cooling can be employed, using a heat exchanger or other apparatus. Alternatively, the reaction product may be removed while still at or near reaction temperature.<br>

The percentages of d through i may be calculated based on the form in which they are commercially available. The function and properties of each ingredient identified above and several "examples of ingredients are summarized in the following sections of this specification.<br>
A.      Base Oils<br>
Any of the petroleum or synthetic base oils previously identified as process solvents for the graftable polyalkenes of the present invention can be used as the base oil. Indeed, any conventional lubricating oil, or combinations thereof, may also be used.<br>
B.	Grafted Polyolefin Dispersant Viscosity Index Improves<br>

alternatively at least about 8 moles, of grafted monomer mixture per mole of the original polyalkene.<br>
D.	Grafted and Non-Grafted Polyolefins used as Viscosity Modifiers<br>
The conventional viscosity index improving polyolefins can be used in the<br>
. formulations according to the present invention. These are conventionally long-chain polyolerlns. Several examples of polyolefins contemplated for use herein include polyisobutenes, polymethacrytates. polyalkytstyrenes, partially hydrogenated copolymers of butadiene and styrene, amorphous polyolefins of ethylene and propylene, ethylene-propylene diene polymers, poryisoprene, and styrene-isoprene. Dispersant viscosity modifiers, as taught in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/444,548 as         well as U.S. Patent No. 5.523,008 and patents cited therein, can also be used according to the present invention.<br>
E.	Conventional Dispersants<br>
Other dispersants also help suspend insoluble engine oil oxidation products, thus preventing sludge flocculatfort and precipitation or deposition of particulates on metal parts. Suitable dispersants include high molecular weight alky! succinimides and the reaction products of oil-soluble polyisobutylene succinic anhydride with ethylene amines such as tetraethylene pentamine and borated salts thereof.<br>
Such conventional dispersants are also contemplated for use herein, although frequently they can be used at reduced concentrations when the grafted poryolefins according to the present Invention are used. Several examples of dispersants include those listed in U.S. Patent No. 4,092,255, column 1, lines 38-41: succinimides or succinic esters, alkylated with a polyolefin of isobutene or propylene, on the carbon in the alpha position of the succinimide carbonyi. These additives are useful for maintaining the cleanliness of an engine or other machinery.<br>
F.	Detergents<br>
Detergents to maintain engine cleanliness can be used in the present lubricating oil compositions. These materials include the metal salts of sulfonic acids, alky! phenols, sulfurized alkyl phenols, alkyi salicylates, naphthenates, and other soluble mono- and dicarboxylic acids. Basic (vis, overbased) metal salts, such as basic alkaline earth metal sulfonates (especially calcium and magnesium salts) are frequently used as detergents. Such detergents are particularly useful for keeping the insoluble particulate materials in an engine or other machinery in suspension. Other examples of detergents contemplated for use herein include those recited in U. S. Patent No. 4,092,255, column 1, lines 35-36: sulfonates, phenates, or organic phosphates of polyvalent metals.<br>
G.	- Anti-Wear Agents<br>
Anti-wear agents, as their name implies, reduce wear of metal parte. Zinc diaikytdithiophosphates and zinc diaryldithiophosphates and organo molybdenum compounds such as molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamates are representative of conventional anti-wear agents.<br>
H.      Anti-Oxidants<br>
Oxidation inhibitors, or anti-oxidants, reduce the tendency of lubricating oils to deteriorate in service. This deterioration can be evidenced by increased oil viscosity and by the products of oxidation such as sludge and varnish-like deposits on the metal surfaces. Such oxidation inhibitors include alkaline earth metal salts of aflcyiphenolthioesters having preferably C5 to C12 alkyt side chains, e.g., calcium nanylphenol sulfide, dfoctylphenylamine, phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine, phospnosuffurteed or suffurized hydrocarbons, and organo molybdenum compounds such as molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamates.<br>
I.       Pour Point Depressants and other Minor Ingredients<br>
Pour point depressants, otherwise known as lube oil flow improvers, lower the temperature at which the fluid will flow or can be poured. Such additives are well known. Typical of those additives which optimize the low temperature fluidity of a lubricant are C8-C18-dialkylfumarate vinyl acetate copolymers, and polymethacrylates.<br>
Many minor ingredients which do not prevent the use of the present compositions as lubricating oils are contemplated herein. A non-exhaustive list of other such additives includes rust inhibitors, as well as extreme pressure additives, friction modifiers, antifoam additives, and dyes,<br>
WORKING EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Laboratory Preparation of Bi-Functional Monomer for Grafting<br>
In this example, an ethylenically-unsaturated monomer containing both nitrogen and'oxygen, having two sites of unsaturation, is prepared. A 500 ml reactor equipped with an electric heating mantle, stirrer, thermometer and water-cooled reflux condenser is charged with about 14 ml of N,N-dimethyl formamide and about 7.0 g of malefc anhydride. The reactor temperature is raised to about 150'C and allowed to reflux at temperature. While at that temperature, about 5g of Methylene tetramine are quickly introduced into the solution. The reaction proceeds for about 3 hours and leads to the formation of a mixture of reaction products comprising amic acids and di-maieimide. e.g., the formation of a bi-functional monomer mixture.   This reaction<br>
mixture, without subsequent purification or separation of components, is suitable for grafting onto a polyalkene.<br>
Example 2<br>
Laboratory Preparation of Graft Low Molecular Weight Polyalkene<br>
A resin kettle equipped with an electric heating mantle, stirrer, thermometer and gas inlet is charged with about 100g of a neat potyalkene. The gas inlet permits the gas to be fed either below or above the surface of the solution. The polyalkene Is heated to 170°C. During heating the polyafkene is purged with an inerting gas (CO2) fed below the surface of the solution. When the polyalkene reaches the appropriate temperature of 170°C, the puige gas is redirected to flow over the surface of the polyalkene. With the polyalkene at temperature, two solutions, one containing the monomer mixture from Example 1 and the other containing di-t-butyl peroxide Initiator are introduced. The monomer mixture is prepared by dissolving about 25g of the monomer from Example 1 in 25 mi of THF. The initiator solution is prepared by dissolving about 10 g of di-t-butyl peroxide in 60 ml of heptane. Five aliquots of the monomer solution are introduced into the resin kettle over a sixty minutes period. The full charge of initiator solution is metered into the resin kettle over the same sixty minutes period. After all of the reactants are added, the mixture is allowed to react for five (5) hours.<br>
Example 3<br>
Laboratory Preparation of Graft Low Molecular Weight Polyalkene<br>
A resin kettle equipped with an electric heating mantle, stirrer, thermometer and gas inlet was charged with about 11.8 g of a neat polyalkene (indopol H-100) and about 29.8 g of o-dichtorobenzene (about 28% by wt). The gas inlet permits the gas to be fed either below and/or above the surface of the solution. The mixture of the polyalkene and o-dichiorobenzene was heated to 170°C. During heating the polyalkene solution was purged with an inerting gas (CO2) fed below the surface of the solution. When the polyafkene solution reached the appropriate temperature of about 170*0, the purge gas was redirected to flow over the surface of the polyalkene solution,<br>
While maintaining the solution at the reaction temperature of 170°C about 3.43g of a mono-functional monomer mixture, based upon the reaction between 4~ aminophenylenediamine and malelc anhydride, was introduced all at once into the polyalkene solution. A solution containing a total of about 4.2 g of dk-butyl peroxide initiator in heptane was then delivered over 3 hours. The reactants were refluxed for an additional 45 minutes after all of the t-butyt peroxide solution was introduced. When the reaction was complete, the o-dichlorobenzene was distilled from the reaction mixture at atmospheric pressure. The resultant grafted tow molecular weight polyalkene was washed with acetone and was, then, dried under vacuum at 60°C. An IR spectrum of the graft product exhibited peaks at 1600 cm-1, 1720 cm1 and 1780 cm'1.<br>
Example 4<br>
Laboratory Preparation of Graft Low Molecular Weight Polyalkene<br>
A resin kettle equipped with an electric heating mantle, stirrer, thermometer and gas inlet is charged with about 100g of a neat polyalkene. The gas inlet permits the gas to be fed either below or above the surface of the solution. The polyalkene is heated to 170°C. During heating, the polyalkene is purged with an fnerting gas (CO2) fed below the surface of the solution. When the poryalkene reaches the appropriate temperature of 170°C, the purge gas is redirected to flow over the surface of the polyalkene. With the polyalkene at temperature, two solutions, one containing a mono-functional monomer mixture based upon the reaction between 4-. aminophenylenediamine and malelc anhydride and the other containing di-t-butyl peroxide initiator are introduced. The monomer mixture is prepared by dissolving about 22g of the monomer in 26 ml of THF. The initiator solution is prepared by dissolving about 10 g of di-t-butyl peroxide in 60 ml of heptane. Five aliquots of the monomer solution are Introduced Into the resin kettle over a sixty minutes period. The full charge of initiator solution is metered into the resin kettle over the same sixty minutes period. After all of the reactants are added, the mixture is allowed to react for five (5) hours.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
