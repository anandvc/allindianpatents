COMPLETE<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
17/10/2005<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
676/MUMNP/2003<br><br><br>
1.        Field of the Invention<br>
In general, the present invention relates to pure polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride, 17P-(N-tert-butyl carbamoyl)-4-aza-5-alpha-androst-l-en-3-one, improved processes for obtaining the pure polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride and pharmaceutical formulations thereof.<br>
2.        Background of the Invention<br>
5-alpha-reductase is an enzyme associated with the nuclear membrane and it is found in high concentrations in human male reproductive tissues, skin, and liver. It catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Two isoenzymes (type I &amp; type II) of 5-alpha-reductase have been identified in the human tissue. The type I isoenzyme is found in scalp skin, while the type II isoenzyme is found in the prostate. Type I 5-alpha-reductase is responsible for approximately one-third of the circulating DHT and type II 5-alpha-reductase is responsible for two-thirds of the circulating DHT. In men with male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), the balding scalp contains miniaturized hair follicles and increased amounts of DHT compared to hairy scalp.<br>
Finasteride is a potent inhibitor of the type II 5-alpha-reductase. Finasteride selectively blocks the production of dihydrotestosterone by a competitive inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations. Finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, reaching 65% suppression within 24 hours of oral dosing with 1 mg tablet.<br>
Various prior art disclosures provide for different processes for producing and isolating pure polymorphic form I of Finasteride, 17p-(N-monosubstituted carbamoyi)-4-aza-5-alpha-androst-l-en-3-one by using different organic solvents or mixture of protic and aprotic solvents.<br><br>
The United States Patent numbered 4,760,071 to Rasmusson, et al. discloses a process for the preparation of 17.beta.-(N-monosubstituted carbamoyl)-4-aza-5.alpha.-androst-l-en-3-one, pharmaceutical compositions used in inhibiting testosterone 5.alpha.-reductase and methods of treating hyperandrogenic conditions with the compound, particularly benign prostatic hypertrophy.<br>
The United States Patent numbered 5,652,365 to McCauley, et al. discloses a process for producing polymorphic Form I of Finasteride, 17B-(N-tert-butyl carbamoyl)-4-aza-5-alpha.-androst-l-en-3-one. The process in this patent discloses that polymorphic Form I of Finasteride is produced by crystallizing a solution of Finasteride in a water immiscible organic solvent and 0% or more by weight of water, producing solvated and non-solvated Finasteride in solution. In accordance with this process, the amount of organic solvent and water in the solution is sufficient to cause the solubility of the non-solvated form of Finasteride to be exceeded. The non-solvated form of Finasteride is less soluble than any other form of Finasteride in the organic solvent and water solution. The process involves recovering the resultant solid phase and removing the solvent. In the process disclosed the water immiscible orgamc solvent is ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate and the amount of water in the solvent mixture is below 4 mg/ml.<br>
The United States Patent numbered 5,886,184 to Dolling, et al. discloses a process for producing Finasteride, the process involving reacting the magnesium halide salt of 17-beta.-carboalkoxy-4-aza-5-alpha.-androst-l-en-3-one with t-butylamino magnesium halide, present in at least a 2:1 molar ratio to the ester, formed from t-butyl amine and an aliphatic/aryl magnesium halide at ambient temperature in an inert organic solvent under an inert atmosphere followed by heating and recovering the product Finasteride polymorphic crystalline Forms I and II.<br>
The United States Patent Application numbered 20020042425A1 to Gormely, Glenn J.; et al. discloses an invention that involves a method of treating and/or reversing androgenic alopecia and promoting hair growth, and methods of treating acne vulgaris, seborrhea, and female hirsutism, by administering to a patient in need of such treatment a 5-alpha-reductase II inhibiter, such as Finasteride, in a dosage amount under 5 mgs/day. This<br><br>
invention discloses the process for producing Finasteride polymorphic form by using solvents like glacial acetic acid.<br>
The United States Patent numbered 5,670,643 to Davis, et al. discloses a method of preparing Finasteride by reacting the acid chloride with t-butylamine in an aprotic solvent, e.g., pyridine, toluene, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile in the presence of a base, e.g., pyridine, diisopropylethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine, or triethylamine, in the temperature range of from about 20 degree C to about 60 degree C. Salts such as LiCl and LiBr, might be used to facilitate this reaction. The resulting compound may be purified by standard methods of the art such as chromatography and crystallization.<br>
The European Patent Application numbered 93203163.6 to Merck &amp; Co. discloses a new process for producing Finasteride, the process involving reacting magnesium halide salt of 17beta-carboaloxy-4aza-5 alpha androst-l-en-3-one with t- butylamino magnesium halide, present in at least a 2:1 molar ratio to the ester, formed from t-butyl amine and an aliphatic/aryl magnesium halide at ambient temperature in an inert organic solvent under an inert atmosphere followed by heating and recovering the product Finasteride. Also disclosed in this patent are the two polymorphic forms I and II of Finasteride and the processes for their production.<br>
There are several disadvantages associated with the known methods for obtaining pure polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride. In the known methods the polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride is obtained from solvents or mixtures of solvents like tetrahydrofuran, glacial acetic acid, ethyl acetate, toluene and/or isopropyl acetate. Typically one of the principal disadvantages in the prior art processes is that during the drying step solvents are difficult to be removed from the crystals and pure crystals are therefore not obtained. The other disadvantage with the prior art processes is that they require too many controls, which make them unsuitable for industrial production.<br>
It is therefore important and essential to develop a process for obtaining pure polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride wherein the process is devoid of the disadvantages mentioned above.<br><br>
3.        Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the principal aspect of the present invention, herein disclosed is a pure polymorphic form 1 of Finasteride, 17P-(N-tert-butyl carbamoyl)-4-aza-5-alpha-androst-l-en-3-one.<br>
