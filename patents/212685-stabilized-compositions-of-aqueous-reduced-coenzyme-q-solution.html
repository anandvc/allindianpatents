DESCRIPTION	  <br>
AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION CONTAINING A REDUCED COENZYME Q<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a solution containing a reduced coenzyme Q as a constituent and, more particularly, to an aqueous solution containing an lOantioxidant and/or a chelating agent added thereto for maintaining a reduced coenzyme Q stable against oxidation.<br>
BACKGROUND ART Coenzymes Q are essential constituents widely<br>
15distributed in living bodies, from bacteria to mammals and are known as mitochondrial electron transfer system constituents in cells of living bodies.  Through repeated oxidation and reduction in mitochondria, coenzymes Q perform their function as transmitter components in the<br>
20electron transfer system and, further, reduced coenzymes Q are known to have antioxidant activity.  In humans, coenzyme Q10, whose coenzyme Q side chain comprises 10 repeating structures, is the main component and, generally, about 40 to 90% thereof occurs in reduced form in living<br>
25bodies.  The physiological activities of coenzymes. Q may be energy production activation through mitochondrial activation, cardiac function activation, cell' membrane stabilizing effect, and cell protecting effect through antioxidant activity.<br>
30     Coenzymes Q are known to be useful in various<br>
application fields.  For example, oxidized coenzyme Q10 is used as a remedy for congestive heart failure owing to its effects on the heart.  Besides such medical uses, they are orally used as nutrients or nutritional supplements, like<br>
35vitamins.  However, coenzymes Q are highly liposoluble and<br><br>
2<br>
hardly soluble in water and, therefore, only oral preparations and dermal preparations are known as their practical uses.<br>
In recent years, various reports have been published 5about the aggravation of diseases due to increases in oxidative stress in blood.  Typical examples are arteriosclerosis, complications of diabetes and the like diseases.  These diseases are caused and/or aggravated by denaturation of lipids and the like due to various<br>
lOoxidative stresses occurring in blood.  For counteracting such effects of oxidative stresses, antioxidant activity promotion by administration of an antioxidant is effective. Vitamin E is a compound representative of the liposoluble antioxidant substances considered to be more effective in<br>
15inhibiting lipid peroxidation and is in wide use in disease prevention and so on.<br>
Recently, it has been reported that the coexistence of reduced coenzyme Q10 is important for vitamin E to properly perform its antioxidant activity (Bowry et al.,<br>
201993, J. American Chemical Society, 115, 6029-6044), and the importance of coenzymes Q as liposoluble antioxidant substances is becoming clear.<br>
Coenzymes Q have themselves strong antioxidant activity and, therefore, the antioxidant activity in blood can be effectively enhanced by sending a sufficient amount of reduced coenzymes Q in solubilized form into blood.  The enhanced antioxidant activity in blood is considered to be useful widely in preventing vascular lesions during ischemia-reperfusion, preventing restenosis in arteriosclerosis, preventing vascular lesions following cerebral infarction, preventing arteriosclerosis, preventing complications of diabetes, and preventing a number of other diseases from being aggravated supposedly by active oxygen species. .Furthermore, by sending it into the living body in a new delivery form, namely by drip, it<br><br>
3<br>
becomes possible to provide patients with a serious illness or a brain disease, who are incapable of oral intake, with coenzymes Q.  It is thus expected that solubilization of coenzymes Q will bring about a number of merits. 5     As is well known, coenzymes Q can occur in both the oxidized form and reduced form, and a number of investigations have so far been made about the method of solubilizing oxidized coenzyme Q10 (ubidecarenone or ubiquinone).<br>
10     As for the solubilization of oxidized coenzyme Q10, various methods have been reported, for example coating with liposomes, suspension using a surfactant or an oil/fat, and the like (Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-05-186340, Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-07-69874, Japanese<br>
15Kohyo Publication 2000-510841).  However, few examples have been put to practice use.  One of the reasons is that while it is necessary for oxidized coenzyme Q10 to be converted to the reduced form by the action of a reductase or the like in order to perform its antioxidant activity, no<br>
20reductase is present in blood and, therefore, no<br>
antioxidant activity against oxidative stresses in blood can be expected upon administration by injection or the like.<br>
On the other hand, reduced coenzyme Q10 itself has<br>
25antioxidant activity, hence it is a substance; much expected to be of great utility in the prevention/treatment of such diseases as mentioned above.  However, it has. not been put into practical use because of its drawback that it is susceptible to oxidation and thus unstable.  Although a<br>
30search report describing the preparation of liposome-coated reduced coenzyme Q10 for the purpose of studying oxidoreductases and so forth is available (Kishi et al., 1999, BioFactors, 10, 131-138), the liposomes used were prepared extemporaneously in each experiment.  Any method<br>
35of stably solubilizing reduced coenzymes Q has not been<br><br>
4<br>
known at all.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide 5an aqueous solution improved in oxidation stability of reduced coenzymes Q.<br>
The present inventors made investigations in an attempt to accomplish the above object and, as a result, found out an aqueous solution composition suitable for lOincreasing the stability of reduced coenzymes Q, which has led to completion of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides an.aqueous solution containing a reduced coenzyme 'Q, which comprises an antioxidant and/or a chelating agent in the same aqueous 15solution.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The following examples illustrate the present invention in further detail.  These examples are, however, 20by no means limitative of the scope of the invention.<br>
(Example 1)  Oxidation stability of liposome-coated reduced coenzyme Q10 as given by an antioxidant<br>
For evaluating the oxidation stability of reduced<br>
25coenzyme Qlo in liposomes, yolk lecithin (lecithin, product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries), which has poor oxidation stability, was selected as the liposome base, and the evaluation of substances capable of increasing the oxidation stability of reduced coenzyme Q10 (content 0.005%<br>
30w/v) was performed under the storage condition of 40°C.<br>
Reduced coenzyme Qi0-containing liposomes were prepared by the following method.  Thus, a powder of reduced coenzyme Qi0 was dissolved in ethanol to give a 0.1 mg/ml solution.  Similarly, a lecithin solution (3.2 mg/ml)<br>
35in ethanol was prepared.  Both solutions (1 ml each) were<br><br>
11<br>
mixed together.  To the resulting mixture was added 2 ml of chloroform and, then, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.  After complete elimination of the solvents, 2 ml of a 50 mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4) was added, and 5the lipid film was dispersed using a mixer to give a milk-white suspension.  This suspension was subjected to sonication in a nitrogen atmosphere at 4°C for 30 minutes for the formation of liposomes, followed by 20 minutes of centrifugation at 3,000 rpm to remove giant molecules as a<br>
lOsedirnent.  The fraction remaining unsettled after<br>
centrifugation was used as reduced coenzyme Q10-containing liposome solution.<br>
Liposomes containing an antioxidant or a chelating agent (0.05% w/v) were prepared as follows.  In the case of<br>
15vitamin E, a 10 mg/ml ethanol solution was prepared and added to a mixed solution containing reduced coenzyme Q10 and lecithin prior to the addition of chloroform in the above-mentioned process for preparing reduced coenzyme Q10-containing liposomes and, thereafter, liposomes were<br>
20prepared in the same manner as mentioned above.  In the case of other water-soluble antioxidants or chelating agents, each antioxidant or chelating agent was dissolved in the above-mentioned HEPES buffer solution to a concentration of 0.05% (w/v) and, thereafter, ¦ liposomes<br>
25were prepared in the same manner.<br>
In this manner, liposomes containing various antioxidant (vitamin E acetate, sodium thiosulfate, citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E (a-tocopherol)) were prepared and evaluated for oxidation stability during storage at<br>
3040°C in the ambient atmosphere.  The results were expressed in terms of residual reduced coenzyme Q10 percentage.<br>
For determining the residual reduced coenzyme Q10 percentage, 1 ml of hexane was first added to 0.05 ml of each liposome solution and, after 30 seconds of stirring,<br>
35the mixture was separated into a hexane layer and an<br><br>
12<br>
aqueous layer by centrifugation {3,000 rpm, 1 minute). Then, the hexane layer was recovered and evaporated to dryness in a nitrogen atmosphere, the residue was dissolved in 0.2 ml of ethanol, and the solution was subjected to 5assaying by HPLC.  The HPLC was carried out under per se known analytical conditions using an electrochemical detector, and oxidized coenzyme Q10 and reduced coenzyme Q10 were respectively quantitated.  The residual reduced coenzyme Q10 percentage was calculated as a percentage<br>
lOrelative to the amount of reduced coenzyme Q10 on the occasion of preparing liposomes.<br>
As a result, the antioxidant-free liposomes underwent oxidation in such a manner that the residual percentage lowered to 10% or below during 1 to 2 days of storage,<br>
15whereas the residual percentage was 63% after 2 days of storage in the case of vitamin E acetate-containing liposomes, 76% after 3 days of storage in the case of sodium thiosulfate-containing liposomes, 54% after 8 days of storage in the case of citric acid-containing liposomes,<br>
20or 68% after 15 days of storage in the case of vitamin C-containing liposomes. However, the addition of vitamin E (a-tocopherol) failed to produce any remarkable effect.<br>
It was thus found that some antioxidants are strongly effective and others are mildly effective in stabilizing<br>
25reduced coenzyme Q10 in liposomes.  More specifically,<br>
vitamin C was the most effective, followed by citric acid, sodium thiosulfate, vitamin E acetate, and vitamin E in that order.<br>
30(Example 2)  Oxidation stability of liposome-coated reduced coenzyme Q10 as given by a chelating agent<br>
The effect of a chelating agent on the residual reduced coenzyme Q10 percentage was evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1.  Liposomes containing 0.05% (w/v)<br>
35of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were prepared in the<br><br>
13<br>
same manner as in Example 1 and stored in the air at 40°C for evaluating the stabilizing effect of the chelating agent.<br>
The reduced coenzyme Q10 in chelating agent-free 51iposomes was oxidized to a residual percentage of 10% or below during 1 to 2 days of storage, whereas the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing liposomes showed a residual percentage of 76% after 43 days of storage.<br>
It is known in the art that the chelating agent lOethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is more or less effective in protecting substances susceptible to oxidation. However, the finding obtained in this example that it is comparable or superior in such protective effect to<br>
antioxidants was guite unexpected. 15<br>
(Example 3)  Effect of an antioxidant on a surfactant<br>
solution - (1)<br>
To a 0.1% aqueous polysorbate 80 solution containing<br>
0.005% (w/v) of reduced coenzyme Q10 was added vitamin C, 20as an antioxidant, to a concentration of 0.05% (w/v), the<br>
solution was stored at 40°C, and the effect of the<br>
antioxidant was evaluated.<br>
The solution without addition of the antioxidant gave<br>
a residual percentage of 27% after 6 days of storage.  On 25the contrary, 88% of the reduced form was retained in the<br>
vitamin C-containing solution even after 6 days of storage.<br>
(Example 4)  Effect of an antioxidant on a surfactant solution - (2)<br>
30     To a solution containing 0.1% of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60; product of Nikko Chemicals) and 0.005% (w/v) of reduced coenzyme Q10 was added vitamin C or citric acid, as an antioxidant, to a concentration of 0.05% (w/v), the solution was stored at<br>
35400C, and the effect of the antioxidant was evaluated.<br><br>
14<br>
The solution without addition of the antioxidant gave a residual percentage of 17% after 7 days of storage.  On the contrary, 73% of the reduced form was retained in the vitamin C-containing solution even after 14 days of 5storage, and 61% of the reduced form was maintained in the citric acid-containing solution even after 71 days of storage.<br>
(Example 5)  Effect of a chelating agent on a surfactant<br>
lOsolution - (1)<br>
The effect of a chelating agent was evaluated in the same manner as in Example 3 except that<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was used as the chelating agent in lieu of the antioxidant.<br>
15     The solution without addition of the chelating agent gave a residual percentage of 27% after 6 days of storage, whereas 80% of the reduced form was retained in the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing solution even after 78 days of storage, indicating the same potent<br>
20protective effect as in the case of liposomes..<br>
(Example 6)  Effect of a chelating agent on a surfactant solution - (2)<br>
The effect of a chelating agent was evaluated in the<br>
25same manner as in Example 4 except that<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was used as the chelating agent in lieu of the antioxidant.<br>
The solution without addition of the chelating agent gave a residual percentage of 17% after 7 days of storage,<br>
30whereas 74% of the reduced form was retained in the<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing solution even after 167 days of storage.  The result obtained that reduced coenzyme Q10 can be maintained at high residual percentages under such high temperature conditions as 40°C<br>
35over a period as long as nearly half a year was quite<br><br>
15	15<br>
unexpected.<br>
