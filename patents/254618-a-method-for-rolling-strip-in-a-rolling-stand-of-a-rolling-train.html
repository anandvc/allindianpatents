METHOD FOR ROLLING STRIP IN A ROLLING STAND<br>
The invention concerns a method for rolling strip in a rolling stand of a rolling train, which rolling stand consists of two axially shiftable work rolls, which are provided with a CVC cross section or similar contour, whose curved contour can be expressed by a polynomial of third or higher order; of two backup rolls and possibly two additional intermediate rolls; and of a work roll bending system and possibly an additional intermediate roll bending system, wherein the work roll bending or the work roll shifting is used from case to case as an adjusting mechanism to control the strip flatness and the strip profile.  Alternatively or additionally, intermediate roll bending and intermediate roll shifting can be used in the same way as work roll bending.<br>
When conventional rolls are used, strip flatness is adjusted by suitable choice of a work roll crown (positive, negative, or cylindrical) and suitable choice of work roll bending.  Therefore, a disadvantage here is that different work roll crowns must be used in different rolling programs, which<br><br>
makes work roll handling difficult. Furthermore, work roll bending often reaches its adjustment limit with complicated rolling programs and thus can no longer ensure flatness.<br>
The use of work rolls with a CVC contour (CVC = continuously variable crown), even in the rear stands of a rolling train, has been found to be an effective means of simplifying work roll handling and at the same time having a positive effect on the profile and the f1atness.<br>
Work roll bending then seldom reaches its limits of adjustment and is available for dynamic control.  A disadvantage here is that, with conventional shifting practice of the CVC work rolls, the shifting range that is used within a rolling program comes out relatively small, and work roll wear is evened out only to a limited extent.  Therefore, a flat CVC cross section is used as a compromise, i.e., a reduced CVC adjustment range at a suitable shifting stroke.<br>
Proceeding on the basis of this prior art, the objective of the invention is to specify a method for rolling strip in a rolling stand with axially shiftable CVC work rolls or work rolls with a similar contour, which allows both simple roll handling and large profile and flatness adjustment and at the same time makes it possible to achieve uniform work roll wear.<br>
This objective is achieved with the features of Claim 1 in such a way that cyclic variation of the work roll bending from<br><br>
strip to strip in a well-defined predetermined part of its adjustment range induces or forces increased cyclic shifting of the work rolls in order to adjust the strip flatness and the body strip profile, wherein the combined action of the two adjustment systems (work roll bending and work roll shifting) allows the very nearly parabolic effects of the two adjustment systems to complement each other, thereby ensuring flatness as well as optimum uniformity of work roll wear.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
The cyclic shifting of work rolls in itself is already well known.  However, this mode of operation has been previously practiced only with rolls with a conventionally cambered work roll cross section, especially in the rear stands of a rolling train (Hitachi Review, Vol. 34,No. 4, pp. 153-167, 1985) or in exceptional cases with tapered rolls in a limited range (EP 0 153 849 A2).<br>
The cyclic variation, in accordance with the invention, of the work roll bending in CVC rolls, which have a relatively large parabolic profile adjustment range, has never been practiced before and is novel.  This cyclic variation of the work roll bending, which can be assisted by the rolling force or by the rolling force distribution within the rolling train, initiates, in the case of CVC rolls, additional cyclic shifting<br><br>
of the work rolls and at the same time results in uniform work roll wear,  The large parabolic profile adjustment range of the CVC work rolls remains available at all times, so that it is possible to react to altered boundary conditions, such as backup roll wear, thermal crown, rolling force, rolling stand loading, etc.  Depending on these boundary conditions, the cyclic shifting of the work rolls is then preferably carried out either in the positive or negative shift adjustment range or in the total shift adjustment range.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the cyclic shifting of the work rolls is directly preset or is indirectly forced by the cyclic variation of the work roll bending, wherein the interaction between the work roll shifting and the work roll bending is controlled online by a process model.<br>
In this connection, the cyclic variation of the work roll positions or work roll bending is carried out only in the permissible range, in which the strip quality parameters, such as flatness (parabolic and higher order), strip contour quality, and strip profile level, can be fulfilled, wherein to maintain these criteria, the cyclic shifting stroke and/or the preset range for the work roll bending can then be limited by the process model (i.e., monitored online).<br>
Since in the case of the first incoming strips after, for example, a roll change, automatically larger shift position<br><br>
changes are to be expected during the adjustment of profile and flatness that then becomes necessary, the cyclic variation of the work rolls is activated either immediately after a roll change or shortly thereafter, for example, after the first five strips.<br>
Alternatively, depending on the design of the rolling stand, instead of or as a supplement to the cyclic variation of the work roll bending, it is possible to use intermediate roll bending or intermediate roll shifting or to use a backup roll profile adjusting mechanism in analogous fashion in order to produce cyclic variation of the work roll positions.<br>
Further details, features, and advantages of the invention are explained in greater detail below with reference to the specific embodiments of the invention shown schematically in the figures.<br>
-- Figure 1 shows a strip width rolling program for 85 strips.<br>
-- Figure 2 shows a finished strip thickness rolling program for 8 5 strips.<br>
-- Figures 3 and 4 show conventional shifting with high stand loading.<br>
-- Figures 5 and 6 show conventional shifting with low stand loading<br>
— Figures 7 and 8 show cyclic shifting with high stand<br><br>
loading.<br>
-- Figures 9 and 10 show cyclic shifting with low stand loading.<br>
-- Figure 11 shows work roll wear contour with cyclic shifting.<br>
-- Figure 12 shows work roll wear contour with conventional shifting.<br>
In the illustrated examples, the two simulated operating modes of work roll shifting and work roll bending are shown for different shifting with the example of a rolling program of 85 strips (coils).  In Figures 1 to 10, the number of strips (number of coils) or the consecutive strip number is plotted on the x-axis.<br>
In Figure 1, the strip widths BB to be rolled according to the rolling program are plotted in mm on the y-axis, and in Figure 2, the finished strip thicknesses BD are plotted in mm on the y-axis.  Up to about strip No. 40, different strip widths BB and finished strip thicknesses BD are rolled, and then strips with a constant strip width of about 1,200 mm and a constant finished strip thickness BD of about 2.8 mm are produced.<br>
In Figures 3 to 6, the results to be expected for conventional shifting of the CVC work rolls with different rolling stand loading or different backup roll wear are plotted for the rolling program shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br><br>
Figures 3 and 4 show the results obtained for the necessary work roll shift position VP in mm (Figure 3) and the applied work roll bending force BK in kN (Figure 4) for high backup roll wear or high stand loading.  As Figure 3 shows, in this conventional operating mode, the work roll positions are adjusted mainly in the positive range in order, for example, to compensate the loading of the stands in this way.  The maximum shift limit VPmax is reached in some cases.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 are similar to Figures 3 and 4 and show the corresponding results obtained for low backup roll wear or low stand loading.  The curves obtained for the work roll shift position VP (Figure 5) and for the work roll bending force BK (Figure 6) resemble those of Figures 3 and 4 in their characteristic properties, but at approximately the same bending force, the work roll shift values VP -- corresponding to the changed boundary condition -- are now operated more in the middle shift adjustment range.  A common feature is that, in conventional shifting practice of the CVC work rolls viewed as a whole, the shift amount is relatively small, and the work roll bending force BK becomes constant (BKconst) after about the 40th strip in accordance with the rolling program.<br>
The results to be expected, in accordance with the invention, for the cyclic shifting of the CVC work rolls and work roll bending at different stand loading or different backup<br><br>
roll wear are plotted in Figures 7 to 10 for the same rolling program.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show the results obtained for the work roll shift position VP in mm (Figure 7) and the applied work roll bending force BK in kN (Figure 8) for high backup roll wear or high stand loading.  A distinct difference from the results of the conventional shifting shown in Figure 3 is the large adjustment range of the CVC work rolls that is utilized, wherein the rolls are operated in both the positive and the negative range.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 are similar to Figures 7 and 8 and show the corresponding results obtained for low backup roll wear or low stand loading.  The curves obtained for the work roll shift position VP (Figure 9) and for the work roll bending force BK (Figure 10) again resemble those of Figures 7 and 8 in their characteristic properties, but at approximately the same bending force, cyclic shifting of the work rolls now takes place more in the negative shift adjustment range in line with the changed boundary condition.<br>
A characteristic feature of the mode of operation of cyclic shifting in accordance with the invention is the oppositely directed interaction between the work roll shift position VP and the work roll bending force BK, which is clearly shown in the drawings.  When the CVC work rolls shift in the negative<br><br>
direction VPn, bending occurs in the positive direction BKP and vice versa.<br>
The uniformity of work roll wear achieved by the cyclic shifting of the CVC work rolls is apparent from Figures 11 and 12, in which the work roll wear AV in mm that develops by the end of the rolling program is plotted over the work roll barrel length BL in mm.  At approximately the same amount of wear in the middle of the barrel, the roll contour WK in the cyclic mode of operation (Figure 11) has a more harmonious shape in the edge region compared to the conventional mode of operation (Figure 12), while a steeper wear flank with a more angular transition is seen in the conventional mode of operation due to the smaller shift.<br>
A more harmonious work roll wear contour has a positive effect on the quality of the strip contour.  The development of strip bulges or increased strip edge drop can thus be compensated more efficiently.<br><br>
