AMMONIA-FREE ALKALINE MICROELECTRONIC CLEANING COMPOSITIONS WITH IMPROVED SUBSTRATE COMPATIBILITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to ammonia-free cleaning compositions for cleaning microelectronic substrates, and particularly to such cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with microelectronic substrates characterized by sensitive IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and copper metallization. The invention also relates to the use of such cleaning compositions for stripping photoresists, cleaning residues from plasma generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, and cleaning residues from planarization processes, such as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), as well as an additive in planarization slurry residues.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Many photoresist strippers and residue removers have been proposed for use in the microelectronics field as downstream or back end of the manufacturing'1 line cleaners. In the manufacturing process a thin film of photoresist is deposited on a wafer substrate, and then circuit design is imaged on the thin film. Following baking, the unpolymerized resist is removed with a photoresist developer. The resulting image is then transferred to the underlying material, which is generally a dielectric or metal, by way of reactive plasma etch gases or chemical etchant solutions. The etchant gases or chemical etchant solutions selectively attack the photoresist-unprotected area of the substrate. As a result of the plasma etching process, photoresist, etching gas and etched material by-products are deposited as residues around or on the sidewall of the etched openings on the substrate.<br>
Additionally, following the termination of the etching step, the resist mask must be removed from the protected area of the wafer so that the final<br><br>
finishing operation can take place. This can be accomplished in a plasma ashing step by the use of suitable plasma ashing gases or wet chemical strippers. Finding a suitable cleaning composition for removal of this resist mask material without adversely affecting, e.g., corroding, dissolving or dulling, the metal circuitry has also proven problematic.<br>
As microelectronic fabrication integration levels have increased and patterned microelectonic device dimensions have decreased, it has become increasingly common in the art to employ copper metallizations, IOW-K and high-K dielectrics. These materials have presented additional challenges to find acceptable cleaner compositions. Many process technology compositions that have been previously developed for "traditional" or "conventional" semiconductor devices containing Al/Si02 or AI(Cu)/Si02 structures cannot be employed with copper metallized IOW-K or high-K dielectric structures. For example, hydroxylamine based stripper or residue remover compositions are successfully used for cleaning devices with Al metallizations, but are practically unsuitable for those with copper metallizations. Similarly, many copper metallized/ IOW-K strippers are not suitable for Al metallized devices unless significant adjustments in the compositions are made.<br>
Removal of these etch and/or ash residues following the etch and/or ashing process has proved problematic. Failure to completely remove or neutralize these residues can result in the absorption of moisture and the formation of undesirable materials that can cause corrosion to the metal structures. The circuitry materials are corroded by the undesirable materials and produce discontinuances in the circuitry wiring and undesirable increases in electrical resistance.<br>
The current back end cleaners show a wide range of compatibility with certain, sensitive dielectrics and metallizations, ranging from totally unacceptable to marginally satisfactory. Many of the current strippers or residue cleaners are not acceptable for advanced interconnect materials such as porous and IOW-K dielectrics<br><br>
and copper metallizations. Additionally, the typical alkaline cleaning solutions employed are overly aggressive towards porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and/or copper metallizations. Moreover, many of these alkaline cleaning compositions contain organic solvents that show poor product stability, especially at higher pH ranges and at higher process temperatures.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
There is, therefore, a need for microelectronic cleaning compositions suitable for back end cleaning operations which compositions are effective cleaners and are applicable for stripping photoresists, cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic materials, and cleaning residues from planarization process steps, such as chemical mechanical polishing and the like. This invention relates to compositions that are effective in stripping photoresists, preparing/cleaning semiconductor surfaces and structures with good compatibility with advanced interconnect materials such as porous and IOW-K and high-K dielectrics and copper metallizations.<br>
It has been discovered that ammonia (NH3) and ammonia-derived bases such as ammonium hydroxide and other salts (NH4X, X= OH, carbonate, etc.) are capable of dissolving /corroding metals such as copper through complex formation. Thus they are poor choices to be used in semiconductor cleaning formulations when compatibility of IOW-K dielectrics (i.e., a K value of 3 or less) or high-K dielectrics (i.e., a K value of 20 or greater) and copper metallizations are required. These compounds can generate ammonia through equilibrium process. Ammonia can form complex with metals such as copper and result in metal corrosion/dissolution as set forth in the following equations.<br>
NH4X *&gt; NH3 + HX   (Equation 1)<br>
Cu + 2 NH3 -&gt; [ Cu (NH3)2]+ -&gt; [ Cu (NH3)2]2+ (Equation 2)<br><br>
Thus, ammonium hydroxide and ammonium salts can provide nucleophilic and metal-chelating ammonia (NH3) through the equilibrium process described in Equation 1, particularly when other bases such as amines and alkanolamines are added. In the presence of oxygen, metals such as copper can be dissolved/corroded through complex formation with ammonia, as described in Equation 2. Such complex formation can further shift the equilibrium (Equation 1) to the right, and provide more ammonia, leading to higher metal dissolution/corrosion.<br>
Generally, sensitive IOW-K dielectrics degrade significantly under strong alkaline conditions. Ammonia and ammonia derived bases also show poor compatibility with sensitive dielectrics, such as hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and methyl silsesquioxane (MSQ). Again, they can provide ammonia and/or other nucleophiles, and thus lead to reaction/degradation of sensitive dielectrics.<br>
It has been discovered that non-ammonium producing strong base alkaline cleaning formulations containing non-nucleophilic, positively charged counter ions (such as tetraalkylammonium) in solvents that contain at least one* corrosion inhibiting arm or moiety show much improved compatibility with sensitive porous or IOW-K dielectrics and/or copper metallization. The preferred solvent matrices are resistant to strong alkaline conditions, due to steric hindrance effects and/or low or no reactivity to nucleophilic reactions (with respect to nucleophiles such as hydroxide ions). The improved dielectric compatibility is partially achieved due to the absence of undesireable nucleophiles in the compositions. Good compatibility with copper metallization is achieved by selective use of certain copper-compatible or "corrosion inhibiting" solvents. These components can be formulated into semi-aqueous to practically non-aqueous (organic-solvent based) cleaning solutions or slurries.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The novel back end cleaning composition of this invention will comprise one or more of any suitable non-ammonium producing strong base containing non-nucleophilic, positively charged counter ions and one or more of any suitable solvent stable under strong alkaline conditions and having a metal-corrosion inhibiting arm in the solvent compound. Among the suitable non-ammonia producing strong bases containing non-nucleophilic, positively charged counter ions suitable for use in the cleaning compositions of this invention there may be mentioned tetraalkylammonium hydroxides or salts of the formula [(R)4N+]P [X~**\, where each R is independently a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, preferably alkyl of from 1 to 22, and more preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms (R* H); and X=OH or a suitable salt anion, such as carbonate and the like; p and q are equal and are integer of from 1 to 3. Suitable strong bases also include KOH and NaOH. Cleaning compositions containing the non-ammonium producing strong bases containing non-nucleophilic, positively charged counter ions show much improved compatibility with porous and IOW-K dielectrics and copper metallization. Ammonia-free tetraalkylammonium hydroxides (TAAH) are very strong bases, yet they have been discovered to provide surprisingly improved compatibility with porous and IOW-K dielectrics compared to cleaning compositions with ammonium hydroxide. Especially preferred are tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and choline hydroxide.<br>
While previous attempts to control or inhibit metal corrosion have involved careful controlling of pH and/or using corrosion inhibiting compounds, such as benzotriazole (BT), at relatively low concentrations of 
 <br>
Preferred as such corrosion inhibiting solvents are compounds having two or more sites capable of complexing with a metal and having one of the two following general formulae:<br>

Suitable metal ion-free materials useful for generating silicates in the cleaner are solid silicon wafers, silicic acid, colloidal silica, fumed silica or any other suitable form of silicon or silica. Metal silicates such as sodium metasilicate may be used but are not recommended due to the detrimental effects of metallic contamination on integrated circuits. The silicates may be present in the composition in an amount of from about 0 to 10 wt. %, preferably in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 5 wt. %.<br>

Preferred chelating agents are aminocarboxylic acids such as EDTA, CyDTA and aminophosphonic acids such as EDTMP.<br>
The cleaning compositions may also optionally contain fluoride compounds in cleaning composition, such as for example, tetramethylammonium fluoride, tetrabutylammonium fluoride, and ammonium fluoride. Other suitable fluorides include, for example fluoroborates, tetrabutylammonium fluoroborates, aluminum hexafluorides, antimony fluoride and the like. The fluoride components will be present in an amount of from 0 to 10 wt. %, preferably from about 0.1 to 5 wt. %.<br>
Thus, a wide range of processing/operating pH and temperatures can be used in effectively removing and cleaning photoresists, post plasma etch/ash residues, sacrifical light absorbing materials and anti-reflective coatings (ARC). It has also found that some of this type formulations are particularly effective to clean very difficult samples which contain tantalum in their structure, such as tantalum (Ta) or tantalum nitride barrier layers and tantalum oxide.<br>
The cleaning compositions of this invention will generally comprise from about 0.05 to about 30 wt. % of the non-ammonium producing strong base; from about 0.5 to about 99.95 wt. % of the corrosion inhibiting solvent component; from<br><br>
about 0 to about 95.45 wt. % water or other organic co-solvent; from about 0 to 40 wt.% steric hindered amines, alkanolamines or hydroxylamines; about 0 to 40 wt. % organic or inorganic acids; about 0 to 40 wt. % metal corrosion inhibitor compounds such as benzotriazole, catechol and the like; from about 0 to 5% wt% surfactant, from about 0 to 10 wt. % silicates, from about 0 to 5 wt. % chelating agents, and from about 0 to 10 wt. % fluoride compounds.<br>

After cleaning the foil pieces with 2-propanol, distilled water and acetone and the foil pieces are dried in a drying oven. The cleaned, dried foil pieces were then placed in loosely capped bottles of preheated cleaning compositions of the invention and placed in a vacuum oven for a period of from two to twenty-four hours at the indicated temperature. Following treatment and removal from the oven and bottles, the cleaned foils were rinsed with copious amounts of distilled water and dried in a drying oven for » about 1 hour and then permitted to cool to room temperature, and then the etch rate determined based on weight loss or weight change.<br><br>

The Cu etch rate test was conducted in the same manner as described herein before and the results are set forth in Table 8.<br><br><br><br>
Similar Cu etch rates test were conducted with a formulation containing TMAH, DMSO and H20, with and without a corrosion inhibiting solvent and the etch rate data is presented in Table 9.<br>
TABLE 9 Cu etch rates (A/hour) at 70-75 °C (oven temperature) (24 hours test)<br><br><br>
Another series of Cu etch rate studies was conducted with a formulation of SFL and TMAH with and without a corrosion inhibiting solvent present in the formulation. The data for such test is presented in Table 10.<br><br>
The following example demonstrates the superior compatibility of the non-ammonium strong bases of this invention, e.g. TMAH, in comparison to the ammonium bases, e.g. ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), with sensitive IOW-K dielectrics, such as hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) type FOx-15™ flowable oxide. The test procedure is as follows. Wafer samples coated with dielectric films were immersed in a magnetically stirred wet chemical solution (stirring rate 300rpm), followed by isopropanol and distilled water rinses. The samples were then dried with a nitrogen stream before IR analysis<br>
Transmittance IR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 740 FTIR spectrometer using a deuterated triglycine sulfate (DTGS) detector.  Spectra were<br><br>
acquired with 4 cm'1 resolution and averaged over 32 scans. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis provides a way of monitoring the structural changes of HSQ dielectrics. The infrared absorption band assignments of typical deposited HSQ films are as follows.<br><br>
The content of Si-H bonds in HSQ films can be determined by measuring the peak areas of Si-H absorption bands at 2,250 cm"1. The use of the silicon wafer's inherent absorption at 650-525 cm"1 (from Si-Si lattice bonds and Si-C impurities) as the internal standard/reference resulted in quantitative IR analyses with good precision (relative standard deviation: 2-5 %).<br><br>
The cleaning capability of compositions of this invention is illustrated in the following tests in which a microelectronic structure that comprised a wafer of the following via structure, namely photoresist/carbon doped oxide/silicon nitride/copper with the silicon nitride punched through to expose copper, was<br><br>
immersed in cleaning solutions for the indicated temperature and time, were then water rinsed, dried and then the cleaning determined by SEM inspection. The results are set forth in Table 12.<br><br>
The same cleaning test was conducted on a microelectronic substrate that comprised a wafer of the following line structure, namely photoresist/tantalum nitride/FSG/copper. Two prior art commercial cleaning products were also tested for comparison purposes. The cleaning results are set forth in Table 13.<br><br>
A similar cleaning test was conducted on a microelectronic structure that comprised a wafer of the following via structure, namely photoresist/carbon doped oxide/silicon nitride/copper without the silicon nitride punched through to<br><br>
expose copper. The results are set forth in TABLE 14.<br><br>
A similar cleaning test was conducted on a microelectronic structure that comprised a wafer of the following via structure, namely pTEOS/Coral/SiN/Coral/SiN/copper. The results are set forth in TABLE 15.<br><br>
