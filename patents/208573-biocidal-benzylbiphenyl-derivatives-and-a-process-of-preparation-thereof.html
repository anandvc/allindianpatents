An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically.  Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials<br>

A number of compounds of formula (I) also have aigicidal properties<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are active against a broad range of bacteria, both gram-positive as gram-negative bacteria. As examples of such gram-positive bacteria there may be named Micrococcus flavus. Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus faecalis, and the like. As example of such gram-negative bactena there may be named Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus morganii, Eschericia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae.

The compounds of formula (I) can be used for the protection of plants and plant-denved materials from degradation by phytopathogenic bacteria. As examples of such phytopathogenic bactena there may be named Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli, Pseudomonas synngae pv phaseolicola. Envinia amylovora, Agrobactenum tumefaciens, Clavibacier michiganense, Envinia carotovora, Envinia tracheiphila, Pseudomonas pisi. Pseudomonas solanacearum, Streptomyces scabies, Xylella fasiidiosa, and the like. Hence, the compounds of formula (I) possess advantageous<br><br>
curative, preventive and systemic biocidal activity to protect plants, in particular culture plants. Said compounds of formula (1) can be used to protect, plants or parts of plants, e.g. fruits, blossoms, flowers, foliage, stems, roots, tubers of plants or culture plants infected, harmed or destroyed by micro-organisms, whereby later-growing parts of plants are protected against such micro-organisms.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can further be used in seed disinfection (fruits, tubers, cereal grains) and to treat plant cuttings as well as to combat phytopathogenous micro-organims occurring in the soil.<br>
As examples of the wide variety of culture plants in which the compounds of the present invention can be used, there may be named for example cereals, e.g. wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, sorghum and the like; beets, e.g. sugar beet and fodder beet; pome and stone fruits and berries, e.g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants, e.g. beans, lentils, peas, soy beans; oleaginous plants, e.g. rape, mustard, poppy, olive, sunflower, coconut, castor-oil plant, cocoa, ground-nuts; cucurbitaceae, e.g. pumpkins, gherkins, melons, cucumbers, squashes; fibrous plants, e.g. cotton, flax, hemp, jute; citrus fruits, e.g. orange, lemon, grapefruit, mandarin; vegetables, e.g. spinach, lettuce, asparagus, brassicaceae such as cabbages and turnips, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, hot and sweet peppers; laurel-like plants, e.g. avocado, cinnamon, camphor tree; or plants such as maize, tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar-cane, tea, vines, hops, bananas, rubber plants, as well as ornamental plants, e.g flowers, shrubs, deciduous trees and evergreen trees such as conifers. This enumeration of culture plants is given with the purpose of illustrating the invention and not to delimiting it thereto<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and compositions composing one or more of these compounds can also be used to prevent the formation of biofilms. Biofilms are composed of millions of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoa) that accumulate on surfaces in aqueous environments (Science, vol. 273, p. 1795 - 1797, 1996). These film-forming microbes excrete a glue-like substance that anchors them to materials such as metals, plastics, tissue, and soil panicles. Once anchored to a surface, biofilm microorganisms carry out a vanety of detrimental or beneficial reactions, depending on the surrounding conditions. Some of the problems associated with biofilm formation include biofouling (fouling or contamination linked to microbial activity), biocorrosion (especially of industrial pipes), oil field souring (the reduction of sulfates by microbes in soil) and infections caused by biofilm growing on host tissues or medical implants.  Biofilm-related problems cost industry billions of dollars<br><br>
annually by corroding pipes, reducing heat transfer or hydraulic pressure in industrial cooling systems, plugging water injection jets, and clogging water filters. In addition, biofilms cause major medical problems through infecting host tissues, harboring bacteria that contaminate drinking water, causing rejection of medical implants, and contamination of medical devices ranging from contact lenses, urinary catheters to artificial hearts.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are stable compounds and no precautionary measures are required for handling them.<br>
In view of the biological activity of the compounds of formula (I) as demonstrated in examples C. 1 to C.4, the subject compounds are useful for controlling, i.e. preventing, inhibiting, eliminating, combatting, or eradicating, micro-organisms.<br>
The invention also relates to biocidal compositions containing one or more inert carriers and, if desired, other adjuvants and as active ingredient a biocidally effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as defined hereinabove. Further the invention relates to a method of controlling micro-organisms, in particular bacteria, by the application of the novel compounds to said micro-organisms.<br>
In the method for controling micro-organisms according to the invention the compounds of formula (l) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation. They are therefore formulated following art-known procedures to emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates, and also encapsulations in e.g. polymer substances. Depending on the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures containing the compound (active ingredient) of formula (I) and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, arc prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface-active compounds (surfactants)<br>
Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms, such as, alkylbenzene mixtures, e.g. dimethylbenzene mixtures or<br><br>
alkylated naphthalenes, aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons such as paraffins, cyclohexane or tetrahydronaphtalene, alcohols such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and their ethers and esters, such as propylene glycol or dipropylene glycol ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents such as N'-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide or water, vegetable oils and their esters, such as rape, castor or soybean oil, possibly also silicon oil.<br>
The solid carriers used e.g. for dusts and dispersible powders are normally natural mineral fillers such as calcite, talcum, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the physical properties it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acid or highly dispersed absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers are porous types, for example pumice, broken brick, sepiolite or bentonite: and suitable nonsorbent carriers are matenals such as calcite or sand. In addition, a great number of pregranulated matenals of inorganic or organic nature can be used, e.g. especially dolomite or pulvensed plant residues.<br>
Depending on the nature of the compound of formula (I) to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The term "surfactants" will also be understood as compnsing mixtures of surfactants.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants can be both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds.<br>
Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, earth alkaline metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22). eg the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or steanc acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which can be obtained e.g. from coconut oil or tallow oil In addition, there may also be mentioned fatty acid mcthvltaunn sails<br>
More frequently, however, so-called synthetic surfactants are used, especially fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates<br>
The fatty sulfonates or sulfates are usually in the form of alkali metal salts, earth alkaline metal salts or unsubsutued or substituted ammonium salts and contain a C8-22akyl radical which also includes the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals, e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfate or of a mixture of fatty alcohol sulfates obtained from natural fatty acids. These compounds also comprise the salts of<br><br>
sulfuric acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazote denvatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and one fatty acid radical containing 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates are the sodium, calcium or triethanolamine salts of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of the phosphoric acid ester of an adduct of p-nonylphenol with 4 to 14 moles of ethylene oxide, or phospholipids<br>
Non-ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives containing 3 to 10 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenols.<br>
Further suitable non-ionic surfactants are the water-soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. These compounds usually contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit.<br>
Representative examples of non-ionic surfactants are nonylphenolpoiyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributyl-phenoxypolyethoxyethanoi. polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypoiyethoxyethanol<br>
Fatty acid esters of polyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan tnoleate. are also suitable non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as A/-substituent, at least one C8-C22alkyl radical and. as further substituents. unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkYI. benzyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates orethylsulfates, e.g. stearyl-trimethylammonium chloride or ben/.yldi(2 chloroelhyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
The surfactants custoinanlv employed in the an of formulation are described e.g. in the following publications<br>

Compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) may further comprise other active ingredients, e.g. other biocides, in particular fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, insecticides or herbicides, for example so as to widen the spectrum of action or to prevent the build up of resistance. In many cases, this results in synergistic effects, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br>
