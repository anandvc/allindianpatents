Flame-retarclants<br>
The instant invention pertains to a novel method of flame retarding an organic polymeric substrate by adding thereto an effective flame-retarding amount of a certain organic phosphate, to a corresponding use and a corresponding polymer composition, to synergistic blends of the phosphate with other flame-retardants and/or stabilizer components, as well as to a novel phosphate.<br>
Halogenated organic phosphates have widely been used as flame-retardants (FR) in organic polymer compositions, often in combination with various synergists. Overall, a growing concern has arisen regarding the generation of smoke and toxic gases which are evolved from these flame-retardants during a fire. While the classic FR may be effective combustion suppressants, the toxic gases they form pose a threat to human exposure. Certain non-halo-genated phosphates have also been suggested for this use, thus opening a way to polymer compositions substantially free of halogen and antimony synergist while still fulfilling flame proof requirements, e.g. WO 99/00450; WO 02/074847. These compositions often require steadfastness enhancing components such as fillers or fibres, cf. WO 03/016388, GB-A-2344596. WO 02/074847 further recommends some organic phosphites for use as syner-gists in flame-retardant compositions. JP-A-2001 -348724 discloses polypropylene fiber con-taining a certain mixture of an aryl phosphate and an alkoxy functionalized sterically hindered amine as flame-retardant.<br>
It has now been found that a specific class of organic phosphates provides especially valu-able properties as flame-retardant for organic polymers.<br>

At this point the mixture is a slurry of approximately 39.0% solids. The peroxide (549 g, 50 weight-% solution of H2O2 in water, 1 equivalent) is added for 2-3 hours while maintaining the pot temperature (reaction is exothermic). After the peroxide addition, the mixture is maintained for 1 hour at 60°C. The reaction mass is homogeneous and the completeness of reaction is<br><br>
checked by LC (&gt;97.0% conversion). Water (1355 g) is added, and the reaction mass is seeded to induce crystallization. Cooling slowly in 2 steps to 45°C and then to 20°C completes crystallization.

The additives mentioned above are preferably contained in an amount of 0.01 to 10.0%, es-pecially 0.05 to 5.0%, relative to the weight of the polymer component (A).<br>
The incorporation of the additives of the invention and optional further components into the polymer is carried out by known methods such as dry blending in the form of a powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions, dispersions or suspensions for example in an inert solvent, water or oil. The additives of the invention and optional further additives may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applying the dissolved or dispersed additive or additive mixture to the polymer material, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent or the suspension/dispersion agent. They may be added directly into the processing appara-<br><br>
tus (e.g. extruders, internal mixers, etc.), e.g. as a dry mixture or powder or as solution or dispersion or suspension or melt.<br>
Therefore, the present invention further pertains to a process for imparting flame retardancy to an organic polymer, which process comprises incorporation of a compound of formula I and/or II as defined above into the polymer.<br>
The invention relates further to a process for imparting both light stability and flame retardancy to an organic polymer, which process comprises incorporation of a compound of formula I and/or II and a sterically hindered amine and/or light stabilizer into the polymer, as well as to the use of a compound of the formula I and/or a compound of the formula II as a flame-retardant for an organic polymer.<br>
The incorporation can be carried out in a heatable container equipped with a stirrer, e.g. in a closed apparatus such as a kneader, mixer or stirred vessel. The incorporation is preferably carried out in an extruder or in a kneader. It is immaterial whether processing takes place in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of oxygen.<br>
An embodiment of special technical importance is a flame-retardant additive combination (blend) comprising<br>
(i) At least one compound selected from the group consisting of the<br>
(a)	Sterically hindered nitroxyl stabilizers,<br>
(b)	Sterically hindered hydroxylamine stabilizers and<br>
(c)	Sterically hindered alkoxyamine or cycloalkoxyamine stabilizers and<br>
(d)	(ii) At least one compound of formula I.<br>
This flame-retardant additive composition preferably contains 20.0-100.0%, especially 25.0-90.0%, by weight of the total composition, of component (ii).<br>
The addition of the additive or additive blend to the polymer can be carried out in all custom-ary mixing machines in which the polymer is melted and mixed with the additives. Suitable machines are known to those skilled in the art. They are predominantly mixers, kneaders and extruders.<br>
The process is preferably carried out in an extruder by introducing the additive during processing.<br>
Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, contra rotating and co rotating twin-screw extruders, planetary-gear extruders, ring extruders or co kneaders. It is<br><br>
also possible to use processing machines provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied.<br>
Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, for example, in Handbuch der Kunststoffex-trusion, Vol. 1 Grundlagen, Editors F. Hensen, W. Knappe, H. Potente, 1989, pp. 3-7, ISBN:3~446-14339-4 (Vol. 2 Extrusionsanlagen 1986, ISBN 3-446-14329-7),<br>
For example, the screw length is 1 - 60 screw diameters, preferably 35-48 screw diameters. The rotational speed of the screw is preferably 10 - 600 rotations per minute (rpm), very particularly preferably 25 - 300 rpm.<br>
The maximum throughput is dependent on the screw diameter, the rotational speed and the driving force. The process of the present invention can also be carried out at a level lower than maximum throughput by varying the parameters mentioned or employing weighing ma-chines delivering dosage amounts.<br>
If a plurality of components is added, these can be premixed or added individually.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be sprayed onto the polymer material. They are able to dilute other additives (for example the conventional additives indicated above) or their melts so that they can be sprayed also together with these additives onto the material. Addition by spraying during the deactivation of the polymerisation catalysts is particularly advantageous; in this case, the steam evolved may be used for deac-tivation of the catalyst. In the case of spherically polymerised polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply the additives of the invention, optionally together with other addi-tives, by spraying.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be added to the polymer in the form of a masterbatch ("concentrate") which contains the components in a concentra-tion of, for example, about 1.0% to about 40.0% and preferably 2.0% to about 20.0% by weight incorporated in a polymer. The polymer must not be necessarily of identical structure than the polymer where the additives are added finally. In such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, and suspensions or in the form of lattices.<br>
Incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation. The materials containing the additives of the invention described herein preferably are used for the production of molded articles, for example rotomolded articles, injection molded articles, profiles and the like, and especially a fiber, spun melt non-woven, film or foam.<br>
Thus, present invention further pertains to a molded or extruded article, a fiber, spun melt non-woven or a foam comprising the composition of the invention.<br><br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following application examples. These are meant for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of this invention in any manner whatsoever. Where given, room temperature depicts a temperature in the range 20-25°C. Percentages are by weight of the polymer substrate unless otherwise indicated.<br>
