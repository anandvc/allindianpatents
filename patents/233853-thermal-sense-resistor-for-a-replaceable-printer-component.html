				<td>THERMAL SENSE RESISTOR FOR A REPLACEABLE PRINTER<br>
COMPONENT<br>
The Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to printers. More particularly, the invention<br>
relates to a variable thermal sense resistor for a replaceable printer component.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The art of inkjet technology is relatively well developed. Commercial<br>
products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, and facsimile machines<br>
have been implemented with inkjet technology for producing printed media.<br>
Generally, an inkjet image is formed pursuant to precise placement on a print<br>
medium of ink drops emitted by an ink drop generating device known as an<br>
inkjet printhead assembly. An inkjet printhead assembly includes at least one<br>
printhead. Typically, an inkjet printhead assembly is supported on a movable<br>
carriage that traverses over the surface of the print medium and is controlled to<br>
eject drops of ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of a microcomputer<br>
or other controller, wherein the timing of the application of the ink drops is<br>
intended to correspond to a pattern of pixels of the image being printed.<br>
Inkjet printers have at least one ink supply. An ink supply includes an<br>
ink container having an ink reservoir. The ink supply can be housed together<br>
with the inkjet printhead assembly in an inkjet cartridge or pen, or can be housed<br>
separately. When the ink supply is housed separately from the inkjet printhead<br>
assembly, users can replace the ink supply without replacing the inkjet printhead<br>
assembly. The inkjet printhead assembly is then replaced at or near the end of<br>
the printhead life, and not when the ink supply is replaced.<br>
Current printer systems typically include one or more replaceable printer<br>
components, including inkjet cartridges, inkjet printhead assemblies, and ink<br>
supplies. Some existing systems provide these replaceable printer components<br>
with on-board memory to communicate information to a printer about the<br>
replaceable component. The on-board memory, for an inkjet cartridge for<br>
example, typically stores information such as manufacture date (to ensure that<br>
excessively old ink does not damage the printhead,) ink color (to prevent<br>
misinstallation,) and product identifying codes (to ensure that incompatible or<br>
inferior source ink does not enter and damage other printer parts.). Such a<br>
memory may also store other information about the ink container, such as ink<br>
level information. The ink level information can be transmitted to the printer to<br>
indicate the amount of ink remaining. A user can observe the ink level<br>
information and anticipate the need for replacing a depleted ink container.<br>
Some replaceable printer components, such as some inkjet printhead<br>
assemblies, include a thermal sense resistor (TSR). A purpose of the TSR is to<br>
allow a printer to determine the temperature of the printhead assembly.<br>
Knowledge of the consistency of the TSR material allows a thermal coefficient<br>
of resistance (TCR) to be determined. The printer can determine the temperature<br>
of the printhead assembly based on the TCR and a measured resistance of the<br>
TSR.<br>
Generally, the printhead assembly heats up in operation. A printer can<br>
monitor the TSR and change the printing algorithm to either add or subtract<br>
energy, thereby changing the size of the ink drops coming out. In the case of a<br>
cold die (e.g., a new cartridge has just been placed in the printer), the printer will<br>
recognize that the printhead assembly is cold and will provide extra energy so<br>
that the ink drops become a little bigger. As the die heats up, the printer will<br>
provide less and less energy. In some systems, the temperature of the printhead<br>
assemblies is monitored to prevent overheating. If the temperature reaches a<br>
certain threshold, the printer may go into a wait mode, where the printer pauses<br>
briefly to allow the printhead assembly to cool down.<br>
In existing printer systems, analog hardware is used to measure the<br>
resistance of the TSR at a known temperature to use as a starting point for later<br>
temperature determinations. The initial resistance measurement is an analog<br>
measurement, which is not very precise. In addition, the analog measurement<br>
hardware is an expensive part of the printer.<br>
It would be desirable to encode and store the TSR resistance at a certain<br>
temperature in the replaceable printer component, and thereby eliminate the need<br>
for analog measurement hardware and the associated cost. The printer would<br>
then be able to use the encoded data along with additional factors to determine<br>
the printhead assembly temperature, without performing the initial analog<br>
measurement of the TSR resistance.<br>
There are typically a limited number of available bits in a replaceable<br>
printer component memory. Additional bits could be implemented if space is<br>
available, but additional bits would increase the cost of the replaceable printer<br>
component. It would be desirable to "double use" certain bits of the memory,<br>
such that bits that represent one type of information are also used to represent<br>
encoded TSR information.<br>
For certain types of bits in replaceable printer component memories, such<br>
as "pen uniqueness" bits, it is desirable to have a relatively random distribution<br>
of bit values, such that the same bit values are not often (if ever) duplicated, and<br>
each memory stores a unique value for pen uniqueness. However, if all of the<br>
TSRs on a particular wafer are designed to have the same nominal resistance, the<br>
bit values representing the measured resistance of the TSRs will cover a<br>
relatively narrow range, and will not provide the randomness desired if the bit<br>
values are to represent both pen uniqueness and TSR information. It would be<br>
desirable to vary the nominal resistance of the TSRs in manufacturing to<br>
increase the range of TSR bit values, and thereby provide more randomness or<br>
uniqueness for the pen uniqueness values.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
One form of the present invention provides a replaceable printer<br>
component including a thermal sense resistor having a first resistance. A<br>
resistance modifier coupled to the thermal sense resistor modifies the first<br>
resistance in one embodiment a memory story a resistance value representing<br>
a magnitude of the modified first resistance.<br>

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments,<br>
reference is made to the accompaying drawings that form a part hereof. and in<br>
which is shown away of illustration specific embodiments in which the<br>
invention may be prached. It is to be understood that other embodiments may<br>
be utilized and -mclurjl or logical changes ni.c, bs0; made without departing<br>
from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description<br>
therefore is taken an a limiting and the scope of the present<br>
invention is detailed is the compended claim:-<br>
I. INKJET PRINTER<br>
Figure 1 is an electrical block diagram of major components of an inkjet<br>
printer according to one embodiment of the present invention. Inkjet printer 10<br>
includes removable inkjet cartridge 12, which includes inkjet printhead assembly<br>
14, memory 16, and ink supply 26. Inkjet cartridge 12 is pluggably removable<br>
from printer 10. Inkjet printhead assembly 14 includes at least one printhead<br>
14A, and thermal sense resistor (TSR) 14B. Memory 16 may include multiple<br>
forms of memory, including RAM, ROM and EEPROM, and stores data<br>
associated with inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26. In one<br>
embodiment, memory 16 includes factory-written data and printer-recorded data.<br>
In one embodiment, memory 16 specifically includes a 26-bit ROM 16A, having<br>
13 "fusible" bits and 13 "masked" bits. In an alternative embodiment, all 26 bits<br>
in ROM 16A are fusible bits. With fusible bits, at any point in the product's life,<br>
the fusible bits can be blown with the correct equipment. Thus, the use of<br>
fusible bits provides a great deal of flexibility. In contrast, masked bits are<br>
"hard-coded" bits that are defined during the fabrication process.<br>
Each fusible bit may be set by blowing a resistor in a circuit 300A<br>
(shown in Figure 3A) representing the fusible bit. Each masked bit may be set<br>
by adding a resistor in a circuit 300B (shown in Figure 3B) representing the<br>
masked bit. In one embodiment, ROM 16A is integrated with inkjet printhead<br>
assembly 14. In an alternative embodiment, ROM 16A may be integrated with<br>
ink supply 26. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that,<br>
rather than incorporating inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26 into an<br>
inkjet cartridge 12, inkjet printhead assembly 14 and ink supply 26 may be<br>
separately housed and may include separate memories.<br>
Printer 10 includes communication lines 20 for communications between<br>
inkjet cartridge 12 and controller 34. Communication lines 20 include address<br>
lines 20A, first encode enable line 20B, second encode enable line 20C, and<br>
output line 20D, which are all connected to ROM 16A in one embodiment. In<br>
one form of the invention, address lines 20A include 13 address lines. First<br>
encode enable line 20B is used to select fusible bits in ROM 16A, and second<br><br>
encode enable line 20C is used to select masked bits in ROM 16A. Address<br>
lines 20A are used to select a particular fusible bit or masked bit. The value of a<br>
selected fusible or masked bit is read by sensing the output on output line 20D.<br>
Inkjet printhead assembly 14, memory 16, and ink supply 26 are<br>
connected to controller 34, which includes both electronics and firmware for the<br>
control of the various printer components or sub-assemblies. A print control<br>
procedure 35, which may be incorporated in the printer driver, causes the<br>
reading of data from memory 16 and adjusts printer operation in accordance with<br>
the data accessed from memory 16. Controller 34 controls inkjet printhead<br>
assembly 14 and ink supply 26 to cause ink droplets to be ejected in a controlled<br>
fashion on print media 32.<br>
A host processor 36 is connected to controller 34, and includes a central<br>
processing unit (CPU) 38 and a software printer driver 40. A monitor 41 is<br>
connected to host processor 36, and is used to display various messages that are<br>
indicative of the state of inkjet printer 10. Alternatively, printer 10 can be<br>
configured for stand-alone or networked operation wherein messages are<br>
displayed on a front panel of the printer.<br>
II. ENCODING TSR INFORMATION<br>
As shown in Figure 1, inkjet printhead assembly 14 includes TSR 14B.<br>
In one embodiment, TSR 14B is 0.5 percent copper, and 99.5 percent aluminum.<br>
The resistance of TSR 14B is measured during the fabrication process, and then<br>
some bits are "blown" in ROM 16A to store an encoded value representing the<br>
measured resistance.<br>
In one embodiment, the resistance of the TSR 14B on each printhead<br>
assembly 14 on a wafer is measured at 32 degrees Celsius. In one form of the<br>
invention, 280 printhead assemblies 14 are formed on a single wafer. The<br>
measured resistance value is truncated (e.g., 258.9 ohms becomes 258 ohms).<br>
The truncated resistance value is then found in resistance-to-encode value<br>
lookup table 200, shown in Figure 2.<br><br>
Lookup table 200 includes columns 202A and 202B, and a plurality of<br>
entries 204. Each entry 204 in lookup table 200 associates a set of bit values<br>
(shown in column 202B) with a resistance value (shown in column 202A).<br>
Based on the bit values found in column 202B for the measured resistance value,<br>
corresponding bits are blown in ROM 16A to store the TSR resistance<br>
information. The blown bits in ROM 16A are later tested to ensure that the<br>
correct encoded TSR resistance values have been stored. In one form of the<br>
invention, to protect against error, if none of the TSR bits are blown (i.e.,<br>
changed from 0 to 1), the part is rejected at the wafer level. If none of the TSR<br>
bits are changed, it indicates that the part was somehow skipped during the bit<br>
blowing process, or the bit blowing process did not work correctly for the<br>
particular part.<br>
III. ROM CIRCUITS<br>
The bit blowing process for ROM 16A varies depending upon whether<br>
the bit is a fusible bit or a masked bit. Figure 3A is a schematic diagram of a<br>
circuit for defining the state of a fusible bit in ROM 16A. Circuit 300A includes<br>
first encode enable input (E_on) 302, output (id_out) 304, address input 306,<br>
transistor 308, resistor 310, transistor 312, second encode enable input (E_off)<br>
314, transistor 316, and ground (p_gnd) 318. Address input 306 is coupled to<br>
one of address lines 20A (shown in Figure 1). First encode enable input 302 is<br>
coupled to first encode enable line 20B (shown in Figure 1). Second encode<br>
enable input 314 is coupled to second encode enable line 20C (shown in Figure<br>
1). Output 304 is coupled to output line 20D (shown in Figure 1).<br>
In one embodiment, each of transistors 308, 312 and 316 is a field effect<br>
transistor (FET). Address input 306 is coupled to the drain of transistor 308.<br>
First encode enable input 302 is coupled to the gate of transistor 308. The<br>
source of transistor 308 is coupled to the gate of transistor 312 and the drain of<br>
transistor 316. The gate of transistor 316 is coupled to second encode enable<br>
input 314. The drain of transistor 316 is coupled to the source of transistor 308<br>
and the gate of transistor 312. The source of transistor 316 is coupled to ground<br><br>
318. Resistor 310 is positioned between output 304 and the drain of transistor<br>
312. The source of transistor 312 is coupled to ground 318.<br>
A fusible bit in ROM 16A, such as the bit represented by circuit 300A, is<br>
read by setting first encode enable input 302 high, setting address input 306<br>
high, and sensing the signal at output 304. First encode enable input 302 is set<br>
high by controller 34 by setting first encode enable line 20B high. Address input<br>
306 is set high by controller 34 by setting the address line 20A coupled to<br>
address input 306 high. The output voltage at output 304 is sensed by controller<br>
34 by sensing the voltage on output line 20D.<br>
Transistor 308 acts as an AND gate, with inputs 302 and 306. If inputs<br>
302 and 306 are both high, a current flows through transistor 308, turning on<br>
transistor 312. Transistor 312 acts as a drive transistor, driving output 304. If<br>
resistor 310 is blown, the voltage at output 304 will be high, indicating a logical<br>
1. If resistor 310 is not blown, the voltage at output 304 will be low, indicating a<br>
logical 0. In one embodiment, resistor 310 is blown by driving a large current<br>
through resistor 310. Transistor 316 is used as an active pull down to prevent<br>
leakage current from transistor 308 from turning on transistor 312 when<br>
transistor 312 should be off. Transistor 316 is turned on by setting second<br>
encode enable input 314 high. When turned on, transistor 316 diverts current<br>
from transistor 308 to ground.<br>
In addition to blowing resistor 310, other methods may be used to create<br>
an open circuit to define the state of a bit in ROM 16A, including mechanical<br>
cutting, laser cutting, as well as other methods.<br>
Figure 3B is a schematic diagram of a circuit for defining the state of a<br>
masked bit in ROM 16A. Circuit 300B is substantially the same as circuit 300A<br>
shown in Figure 3A, with the exceptions that resistor 310 is replaced by switch<br>
320, and transistor 322 has a narrow width than transistor 312. In one<br>
embodiment, switch 320 is not an actual physical switch, but represents either<br>
the presence or absence of a resistor. In one form of the invention, a resistor 320<br>
is added during the fabrication process to provide a logical 1 bit value. If a<br>
resistor is present in place of switch 320, the resistor has sufficient resistance to<br><br>
act as an open circuit between output 304 and transistor 322. If a resistor is not<br>
present in place of switch 320, there is no additional resistance between output<br>
304 and transistor 322.<br>
Address input 306 is coupled to one of address lines 20A (shown in<br>
Figure 1). First encode enable input 302 is coupled to second encode enable line<br>
20C (shown in Figure 1). Second encode enable input 314 is coupled to first<br>
encode enable line 20B (shown in Figure 1). Output 304 is coupled to output<br>
line 20D (shown in Figure 1).<br>
Address input 306 is coupled to the drain of transistor 308. First encode<br>
enable input 302 is coupled to the gate of transistor 308. The source of transistor<br>
308 is coupled to the gate of transistor 322 and the drain of transistor 316. The<br>
gate of transistor 316 is coupled to second encode enable input 314. The drain<br>
of transistor 316 is coupled to the source of transistor 308 and the gate of<br>
transistor 322. The source of transistor 316 is coupled to ground 318. Switch<br>
310 is positioned between output 304 and the drain of transistor 322. The source<br>
of transistor 322 is coupled to ground 318.<br>
A masked bit in ROM 16A, such as the bit represented by circuit 300B,<br>
is read by setting first encode enable input 302 high, setting address input 306<br>
high, and sensing the signal at output 304. First encode enable input 302 is set<br>
high by controller 34 by setting second encode enable line 20C high. Address<br>
input 306 is set high by controller 34 by setting the address line 20A coupled to<br>
address input 306 high. The output voltage at output 304 is sensed by controller<br>
34 by sensing the voltage on output line 20D.<br>
Transistor 308 acts as an AND gate, with inputs 302 and 306. If inputs<br>
302 and 306 are both high, a current flows through transistor 308, turning on<br>
transistor 322. Transistor 322 acts as a drive transistor, driving output 304. If<br>
switch 310 is open (i.e., resistor present), the voltage at output 304 will be high,<br>
indicating a logical 1. If switch 310 is closed (i.e., resistor not present), the<br>
voltage at output 304 will be low, indicating a logical 0. Transistor 316 is used<br>
as an active pull down to prevent leakage current from transistor 308 from<br>
turning on transistor 322 when transistor 322 should be off. Transistor 316 is<br>
turned on by setting second encode enable input 314 high. When turned on,<br>
transistor 316 diverts current from transistor 308 to ground.<br>
IV. ROM CONTENTS<br>
Figure 4 is a table illustrating information stored in ROM 16A according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention. Table 400 includes address line<br>
identifiers 402, encode enable line identifiers 404, bit type identifiers 406A and<br>
406B (collectively referred to as bit type identifiers 406), bit values 408, and<br>
fields 410A-410J (collectively referred to as fields 410). Table 400 is divided<br>
into portion 412 and portion 414. Portion 412 of table 400 represents<br>
information associated with fusible bits, as indicated by fusible type identifier<br>
406A. Portion 414 of table 400 represents information associated with masked<br>
bits, as indicated by masked type identifier 406B. Each one of the address line<br>
identifiers 402 represents one of address lines 20A (shown in Figure 1), and<br>
corresponds to either a fusible bit or a masked bit. Both the fusible and the<br>
masked bits are numbered 1-13, indicating the particular address line 20A<br>
associated with the bit. Encode enable line identifiers 404 indicate the encode<br>
enable line 20B or 20C that must be set in order to select the corresponding bit.<br>
A "1" in encode enable line identifiers 404 corresponds to first encode enable<br>
line 20B, which is used to select fusible bits. A "2" in encode enable line<br>
identifiers 404 corresponds to second encode enable line 20C, which is used to<br>
select masked bits.<br>
Fusible bits 1-13 and masked bits 1-13 are divided into a plurality of<br>
fields 410. Each bit in a particular field 410 includes a bit value 408. When a<br>
bit is set, it has the value indicated in its corresponding bit value 408. When a<br>
bit is not set, it has a value of 0. In one embodiment, fusible bits 1-13 and<br>
masked bits 1-13 are set during manufacture of ROM 16A. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, fusible bits 1-13 are set post-manufacture of ROM 16A. Also, as<br>
mentioned above, ROM 16A includes all fusible bits in an alternative<br>
embodiment, so all bits can be set post-manufacture.<br><br>
TSR/Pen uniqueness field 410A includes fusible bits 11-13. In one<br>
embodiment, fusible bits 11-13 are the most significant 3 bits representing the<br>
measured resistance of TSR 14B. As mentioned above, the bits representing the<br>
measured resistance of TSR 14B are taken from column 202B of lookup table<br>
200. As will be described further below, the TSR bits are also used to provide<br>
pen uniqueness information.<br>
Ink fill field 410B includes fusible bits 9-10. In one embodiment, fusible<br>
bits 9-10 provide a reference level or trigger level to determine when a low ink<br>
warning should be displayed.<br>
Marketing field 410C includes fusible bits 5-8. In one embodiment,<br>
fusible bits 5-8 are used to identify whether an inkjet cartridge can be used in a<br>
particular printer.<br>
TSR/Pen uniqueness field 410D includes fusible bits 1-4. In one<br>
embodiment, fusible bits 1-4 are the least significant 4 bits representing the<br>
measured resistance of TSR 14B. As mentioned above, the bits representing the<br>
measured resistance of TSR 14B are taken from column 202B of lookup table<br>
200. As will be described further below, the TSR bits are also used to provide<br>
pen uniqueness information.<br>
Pen uniqueness field 410E includes masked bits 12-13. In one<br>
embodiment, masked bits 12-13 are the most significant two bits of a random<br>
number that is used in conjunction with TSR/Pen uniqueness fields 410A and<br>
410D to provide a pen uniqueness value for inkjet cartridge 12.<br>
Field 41 OF includes masked bit 11. In one embodiment, masked bit 11 is<br>
not used to store data, so field 410F includes the letters "NA" (i.e., not assigned).<br>
Field 410G includes masked bit 10. In one embodiment, masked bit 10<br>
provides nozzle location information.<br>
Field 410H includes masked bit 9. In one embodiment, masked bit 9 is a<br>
parity bit used in association with the bits corresponding to pen type field 4101.<br>
Pen type field 4101 includes masked bits 5-8. In one embodiment,<br>
masked bits 5-8 provide an identification of the type of inkjet cartridge that is<br>
associated with ROM 16A.<br><br>
Pen uniqueness field 410J includes masked bits 1-4. In one embodiment,<br>
masked bits 1-4 are the least significant 4 bits of a random number that is used in<br>
conjunction with TSR/Pen uniqueness fields 410A and 410D to provide a pen<br>
uniqueness value for inkjet cartridge 12. The pen uniqueness value, comprising<br>
fields 410A, 410D, 410E, and 410J, uniquely identifies an inkjet cartridge 12,<br>
which allows printer controller 34 to determine when a new inkjet cartridge has<br>
been installed. In one embodiment, if the pen uniqueness value of a newly<br>
inserted cartridge is different than the last three cartridges inserted, the printer<br>
will behave as if a new cartridge has been inserted, and may perform an<br>
alignment scheme, an ink level sense reset and energy calibration.<br>
Printer 10 obtains TSR resistance information from fields 410A and<br>
410D in ROM 16A, and can determine the temperature of inkjet printhead<br>
assembly 14. Unlike previous printing systems, printer 10 does not have to<br>
perform an initial analog measurement of the resistance of TSR 14B. By<br>
knowing the thermal coefficient of resistance (TCR), and the resistance of TSR<br>
14B at a certain temperature (which is encoded in fields 410A and 410D in<br>
ROM 16A), printer 10 can determine from other factors the temperature of inkjet<br>
printhead assembly 14. Printer 10 can also obtain a pen uniqueness value from<br>
ROM 16A, which includes the encoded TSR information in fields 410A and<br>
410D, as well as a random number from fields 410E and 410J.<br>
In prior printer products, the TSRs have been designed to have the same<br>
length for every inkjet printhead assembly die on a wafer, and have been<br>
designed to have the same nominal resistance of about 240-250 ohms. To<br>
provide a greater degree of randomness to the pen uniqueness values, in one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the range of TSR values in fields 410A<br>
and 410D is extended by fabricating TSRs 14B with different nominal resistance<br>
values, as described in further detail below.<br>
V. VARIABLE TSR<br>
Figure 5A is an enlarged top view of a variable length portion 500 of<br>
TSR 14B. In one embodiment, variable length portion 500 is positioned near a<br>
lower left corner of the inkjet printhead assembly die. In one form of the<br>
invention, TSR 14B also includes other portions coupled to variable portion 500<br>
that extend to other regions of the inkjet printhead assembly die.<br>
Variable TSR portion 500 includes serpentine-shaped region 502 having<br>
a plurality of transition regions 506 near the top and the bottom of serpentine<br>
region 502. In one embodiment, current enters TSR portion 500 through<br>
conductor 508, moves up and down through the multiple legs of serpentine<br>
region 502, and then exits through conductor 504.<br>
In one form of the invention, the design for TSR portion 500 is included<br>
in the die database for inkjet printhead assembly 14. TSR portion 500 is formed<br>
using standard fabrication techniques that include depositing a metal layer, and<br>
etching the metal layer using an appropriate photomask to generate the<br>
serpentine shape 502 shown in Figure 5A.<br>
Figure 5B is an enlarged top view of the variable TSR portion 500 shown<br>
in Figure 5A, with a shorting bar or jumper 510 added to vary the resistance of<br>
portion 500, and correspondingly, the resistance of the entire TSR 14B.<br>
Shorting bar 510 effectively shortens TSR portion 500 by shorting the first few<br>
transition regions 506 near the bottom of TSR portion 500, thereby changing the<br>
nominal resistance of TSR 14B. So instead of going up and down through the<br>
first few legs of serpentine portion 502, most of the current will flow<br>
horizontally through shorting bar 510 until the current reaches about halfway<br>
across serpentine portion 502, and then the current will start flowing up and<br>
down through the remaining legs of serpentine portion 502 and exit through<br>
conductor 504.<br>
In one embodiment, four different lengths of TSR 14B (and four different<br>
nominal resistance values) are provided on a wafer by modifying the length of<br>
variable TSR portion 500 with a variable length shorting bar 510. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, five different lengths of TSR 14B (and five different<br>
nominal resistance values) are provided on a wafer. Other numbers of TSR<br>
lengths may be provided in additional alternative embodiments.<br><br>
One form of the present invention provides a method of fabricating<br>
variable resistance TSRs in inkjet printhead assemblies, without the need to<br>
design a unique inkjet printhead assembly die for each desired TSR nominal<br>
resistance value. In one embodiment, variable length shorting bars 510 are<br>
added in the mask frame instead of the inkjet printhead assembly die. Thus,<br>
mask frame data (rather than die data) is used to make minor modifications to<br>
the length of the TSRs 14B on a wafer.<br>
One generic inkjet printhead assembly die design is replicated multiple<br>
times on a wafer (or multiple wafers). In one form of the invention, there are<br>
280 inkjet printhead assembly die formed on a wafer. A database contains soft<br>
copies of the generic die design. The inkjet printhead assembly die is designed<br>
once, and the design is put in 280 times into a full wafer photomask. In addition<br>
to die data, the photomask also includes frame data. The frame is generally a<br>
border around each individual die. The frame data is stored separately from the<br>
die data. The frame is relatively large, has only a few features in it, and has<br>
spots for 280 die. The frame is populated with 280 copies of the generic inkjet<br>
printhead assembly die contained in the die database. The frame includes<br>
features for generating variable length shorting bars 510.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a photomask with four or five die spots is<br>
used. So four or five inkjet printhead assembly die would be printed, the<br>
photomask would be moved, four or five more die would be printed, and the<br>
process would be repeated until 280 die have been generated. Alternatively, the<br>
four or five die in the photomask could be inserted into a larger photomask, such<br>
as a full wafer photomask. The four or five die in the photomask would be<br>
substantially identical, except that the overlaid frame adds shorting bars 510 of<br>
varying length to produce TSRs 14B of varying nominal resistance.<br>
Figure 6 is a bar graph 600 illustrating the measured TSR resistance from<br>
a plurality of inkjet printhead assemblies 14 on a single wafer. On the horizontal<br>
axis, there is a list of pen numbers ranging from 1 to 100, each of which<br>
represents one inkjet printhead assembly 14 on a single wafer. In one<br>
embodiment, there are up to 280 inkjet printhead assemblies on a wafer, but only<br>
100 are shown in Figure 6. The vertical axis shows resistance values in ohms for<br>
TSRs 14B.<br>
As indicated by graph 600, there are four different lengths of TSRs 14B<br>
(and four different nominal resistance values) for the inkjet printhead assemblies<br>
14 on the wafer (which are identified by reference numbers 602A, 602B, 602C,<br>
and 602D). Despite being designed for the same nominal resistance, the TSR<br>
resistance varies within each one of the four groups 602A, 602B, 602C, and<br>
602D, because of manufacturing tolerances. Thus, in addition to the designed<br>
four (or five) nominal resistance differences, there is a range of TSR resistance<br>
values within each group 602A, 602B, 602C, and 602D of TSRs 14B. The<br>
thickness, line width, and material composition of the TSRs 14B may vary<br>
across the wafer. So even though the TSRs 14B are designed for a nominal<br>
point, there is a certain range of measurements that will occur in the normal<br>
manufacture of these parts.<br>
Within each group 602A, 602B, 602C, or 602D of TSRs 14B, if the<br>
truncated resistance value of one TSR 14B varies enough from another TSR 14B<br>
(e.g., one ohm or more), the two TSRs 14B will be assigned a different set of<br>
TSR bits (which are stored in fields 410A and 410D of ROM 16A. If there is<br>
not more than one ohm separation between the truncated resistance values of<br>
TSRs 14B, the TSRs 14B will have the same set of seven bits in fields 410A and<br>
410D, but the additional bits in fields 410E and 410J will cause a variation in the<br>
pen uniqueness value. Graph 600 also indicates that, if the nominal resistance of<br>
the TSRs 14B were not variable, the only variation in fields 410A and 410D<br>
would be the relatively minor resistance variation that occurs within a single<br>
group 602A, 602B, 602C, or 602D. And the likelihood of getting pen<br>
uniqueness values that are the same would go up.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention encodes and stores the TSR<br>
resistance at a certain temperature in a replaceable printer component, and<br>
thereby eliminates the need for analog measurement hardware and the associated<br>
cost. Printer 10 is, therefore, able to use the encoded data along with additional<br>
factors to determine the temperature of printhead assembly 14, without<br>
performing the previously required initial analog measurement of the TSR<br>
resistance.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also address the problem of the<br>
limited number of bits that are typically available in a replaceable printer<br>
component memory by double using certain bits, and thereby avoid the<br>
additional cost for adding more bits. In one embodiment, bits that represent one<br>
type of information (e.g., pen uniqueness information) are also used to represent<br>
encoded TSR information. Also, in embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
nominal resistance of the TSRs is varied in manufacturing to increase the range<br>
of TSR bit values, and thereby provide more randomness or uniqueness for the<br>
pen uniqueness values.<br>
