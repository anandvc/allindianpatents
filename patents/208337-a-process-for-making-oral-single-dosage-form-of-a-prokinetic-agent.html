COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
A Process for making Oral single dosage form of a Prokinetic Agent<br>
M/s Aristo Pharmaceutical Ltd. 23-A, Shah Industrial Estate, Off Veera Desai road, Andheri (W), Mumbai - 400 053.<br>
Name of the inventors -<br>
1)   Mr. Manutosh Manohar Acharya, Indian, residing at 4/7, Amaltas Parisar Shahpura, Bhopal (MP), India.<br>
The following complete specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
A Process for making Oral single dose form of a Prokinetic Agent<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is among the most common disorders seen by the gastroenterologists and general practitioners. This disease is characterized as the backward flow of the stomach contents into the esophagus. One of the most important factors in the pathogenesis of gastro-esophageal reflux disease is a reduction in the pressure barrier due to the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter. Failure of the lower esophageal sphincter can arise due to a low basal pressure, sphincter relaxation, or to a non-compensated increase in intragastric pressure.<br>
(2)	Other factors in the pathogenesis of the disease are delayed gastric emptying, insufficient esophageal clearing due to impaired peristalsis and the corrosive nature of the reflux material which can damage esophageal mucosa.<br>
(3)	Itopride, i. e., N-[p-[2-(dimethylamino) ethoxy] benzyl] veratramide hydrochloride, CAS Registry no 1222898-67-3 is a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent. Itopride and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be here after termed as "itopride". Itopride formulations in market are in which Itopride hydrochloride. Itopride increases the release of acetylcholine (ACh) through dopamine D2-receptor antagonistic action and inhibits decomposing released ACh through its acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitory action, resulting in enhancement of gastrointestinal motility. Unlike Cisapride &amp; Mosapride the Itopride has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors.<br><br>
(4)	Itopride has stimulatory action on colonic perstalisis, propelling colonic luminal content different from that of cisapride &amp; mosapride. Therefore, itopride may be useful drug for the treatment of functional bowel disorders such as functional constipation.<br>
(5)	Conventionally itopride is given 50 mg three times daily for decreasing acid reflux in the esophagus in patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease. Maintenance therapy is often necessary to prevent recurrent symptoms and oesophagitis. It is more convenient for patients to receive long-term effective controlled release of itopride dosage forms/ once-a-day than the conventional itopride dosage forms administered three times a day;<br>
(6)	Itopride has a biological half-life of about 5-6 hours. Its gastroprokinetic threshold dose was as large as 3-10 times those of cisapride, domperidone and metoclopramide. Thus, it is suitable for formulation into oral controlled release dosage form. A once-a-day controlled release dosage form eliminates the inconvenience to the patient in taking multiple dosing at different times and thus ensures patient compliance to the prescribed dosage regimen.<br>
(7)	An optimum design of an oral controlled release dosage form of itopride for once-a-day therapy in humans also requires that the dosage form provide a control on the plasma levels such that the mean residence time (i. e. the mean time that a drug spends in the body) is within a desirable range for said once-a-day therapy in humans. Hence, an oral controlled release dosage form for itopride that releases the itopride in a controlled manner so as to provide control over itopride plasma levels, such that the ratio of peak plasma levels to the plasma levels at 24 hours after administration, and the mean residence time of itopride, are within a desirable range for once-a-day therapy in humans, is thus required. There is no earlier controlled release once-a-day dosage form of itopride.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(13)	Following description contains many examples, these should not be construed as limitation in the scope of invention, but rather as an exemplification of the prepared embodiments thereof, many other modifications can be possible. Itopride increases the release of acetylcholine (ACh) through dopamine D2-receptor antagonistic action and inhibits decomposing released ACh through its acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitory action, resulting in enhancement of gastrointestinal motility. Itopride has stimulatory action on colonic peristalsis propelling colonic luminal content different from that of cisapride &amp; mosapride. Therefore, itopride may be useful drug for the treatment of functional bowel disorders such as functional constipation. Unlike Cisapride &amp; Mosapride the itopride has no affinity for the 5-HT4 receptors. Itopride has a biological half-life of about 5-6 hours. Its gastroprokinetic threshold dose was as large as 3-10 times those of cisapride, domperidone and metoclopramide It is more convenient for patients to receive long-term effective controlled release itopride dosage forms once-a-day than the conventional itopride dosage forms administered three times a day. Thus, it is suitable for formulation into oral controlled release dosage form. A once-a-day controlled release dosage form eliminates the inconvenience to the patient in taking multiple dosing at different times and thus ensures patient compliance to the prescribed dosage regimen.<br>
(14)	The compatibility (physical and chemical) study was done taking suitable, ratio of itopride hydrochloride with the individual excipients and the combination drugs. The sample mixtures were blended and triturated gently in glass mortar and pestle and these were filled in glass vials and sealed with high viscosity polyethylene closures. Few pinholes were made on the cap for maintaining the relative humidity and the vials were placed on 40° C ± 2° C / 75 % ± 5% RH. Samples were analysed on differential scanning calorimeter and visually for initially, and at the interval of 15 days for one month. The results were compared to check the compatibility (physical and chemical) of the drug<br><br>
with excipients. It was found that the vials containing drug and excipients blend triturate were satisfactory in appearance as compared to individual control samples.<br>
(15)	In order to screen for formulation stability we have formulated five different types of process for the formulation. The analysis was done by HPLC (Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 150 mm, Ci8j Zorbax XBD column using buffer (prepared 0.01M potassium di-hydrogen orthophosphate buffer and adjusted the pH3.0 with diluted ortho-phosphoric acid) and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 80:20 respectively and detection was done at 260 run. The stability studies were done as per ICH guidelines for 6 months.<br>
(16)	As per United States Pharmacopoeia criteria the quantity of the dissolution medium used should be not less than three times that required to form a saturated solution of the drug substance, which complies when used 0.1 N HC1 for itopride hydrochloride, based on the solubility equilibrium of the drug substance. The dissolution of dosage forms carried out by using 900 ml 0.1 N HC1 which complies with the sink conditions mentioned in USP. (Ref. USP/NF, Vol. 27, 2004 Page no. 2514).<br>

A Novel Pharmaceutical Composition of a proton pump inhibitor with a Prokinetic Agent<br>
A Novel pharmaceutical composition, comprising co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole and a prokinetic agent, mosapride in a single unit formulation for once a dose, wherein the proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agents are formulated and presented in a manner to minimize interaction of pantoprazole with mosapride and a single unit dosage form to deliver a enteric coated proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole along with the sustained/controlled/floating gastroretentive sustained or controlled release prokinetic agent mosapride for once a day administration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), reflux oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer and other gastric acid related disorders are disorders having a pathogenesis related to reduced gastric motility, i.e., reduced clearing capacity of the stomach, and release of excessive gastric acid. Aside from behavioral changes, GERD and gastric ulcer have been successfully treated with a range of gastric acid inhibitors, such as ranitidine and omeprazol, which are known as H2 blocker or acid-suppressing drugs. Stimulation of gastric motility has been proposed to accelerate the healing of gastric ulcer. Prokinetic drugs, such as cisapride, are known to enhance gastrointestinal motility and prevent duodenogastric reflux, and are widely used to treat GERD. Ranitidine and prokinetic drugs have been used in combination to treat gastric ulcer and other related disorders.<br>
(2)	H2 receptor antagonists are widely prescribed for GERD. Their higher cost has been compensated by the clinical results obtained both in terms of symptom relief and healing. These advantages have been related to their mode of action, which offered more potent and longer duration of effect on gastric acidity.<br>
(003)	The pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate is equivalent to pantoprazole. The<br>
pantoprazole and or its salts here after will be termed as "pantoprazole". Pantoprazole is a<br><br><br>
proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2 receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of relapse for reflux oesophagitis.<br>
(004) The prokinetic agents in the present invention, mosapride citrate dihydate is equivalent to mosapride citrate and or its salts here after will be termed as "mosapride" in this application. They are a benzamide-type gastroprokinetic agent that enhances the gastrointestinal motility by stimulating the 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT4) receptor.<br>
(005)The US Patent 6,132,771 discloses oral pharmaceutical composition comprising a proton pump inhibitor &amp; a prokinetic agent, the proton pump inhibitor claimed is omeprazole &amp; its salt and proknetic agent is Mosapride and Cisapride, the dosage form is a multiple unit tableted dosage forms, multilayered tablets, or a capsule filled with more than one pharmaceutically active compound but both in conventional dosage form. The dose for proton pump inhibitor mentioned here is omeprazole is the dose is 10/20mg once a day and prokinetic agent mosapride is to be given 5mg thrice a day hence combining the two will have problem of dose adjustment and frequency.<br>
Our patent discloses once a day dosage form containing proton pump inhibitor Pantoprazole 20 /40 mg with Mosapride 15mg SR, which eliminates the problem of dose adjustment &amp; frequency.<br>
(6)	Pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles, as disclosed, for example, in EP-A 0005129, EP-A 0166287 and EP-A 0268956 are becoming increasingly important, because of their H7K+ ATPase-inhibiting action, for the therapy of diseases which originate from increased gastric acid secretion. The present invention comprises of proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole.<br>
(7)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutical tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a<br>
2<br><br>
therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet and blend/ granule in a capsule.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
(8)	The present invention comprises co-administration of a proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole and a prokinetic agent, mosapride in a single unit formulation, wherein the proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic agents are formulated and presented in a manner to minimize interaction of pantoprazole with mosapride a single unit dosage form to deliver a enteric coated proton pump inhibitor Pantoprazole along with the immediate release and or sustained/controlled/floating gastroretentive sustained or controlled release prokinetic agent mosapride for once a day administration.<br>
(9)	It is well known that some of the gastric acid suppressing agents, such as proton pump inhibitors are susceptible to degradation/transformation in acid reacting and neutral media. In respect of the stability properties, it is obvious that the one of the active substances being an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor must be protected from contact with acidic gastric juice by an enteric coating layer or delayed release.<br>
(10)	There are problems to produce a fixed unit dosage form comprising a rather high amount of active substance. Different active substances with differing physical properties in the same preparation give further problems. In order to obtain a pharmaceutical dosage form of pantoprazole, which prevents it from contact with the mosapride and acidic gastric juice, the pantoprazole must be enteric coated.<br>
(11)	In order to enhance the storage stability of the enteric coated tablet of pantoprazole, the cores of the tablet must also contain alkalizing agent. When such an alkaline core is enteric coated with an amount of a conventional enteric coating polymer such as, for example, cellulose acetate phthalate, that permits the dissolution of the coating and the active drug contained in the cores in the proximal part of the small intestine, it also will allow some diffusion of water of gastric juice through the enteric coating into the cores, during the time the dosage form resides in the stomach before it is emptied into the small intestine. The diffused water of gastric juice will dissolve parts of the core in the close proximity of the enteric coating layer and there form an alkaline solution inside the coated dosage form. The alkaline nature of core will interfere with the enteric coating and<br>
4<br><br>
eventually dissolve it. The 3-4% of the seal coat of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose is done in order to prevent the incompatibility of the alkaline nature of the core with the enteric coating.<br>
(012) The present invention contains a single unit dosage form of a capsule which contains two parts (tablet and blend/granules in a capsule), first part comprises of a proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and alkalizing agent compressed in tablet and it is enteric coated and second part comprises of the blend and or granules of a prokinetic agent, mosapride with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in a single unit formulation.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
(013)	Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, which rapidly takes share from H2<br>
receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis and healing and prevention of<br>
relapse for reflux oesophagitis. The prokinetic agents in the present invention, mosapride<br>
citrate dihydate is equivalent to mosapride citrate and or its salts here after will be termed<br>
as "mosapride" in this application. They are a benzamide-type gastroprokinetic agent that<br>
enhances the gastrointestinal motility by stimulating the 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT4)<br>
receptor.<br>
(14)	A combination therapy comprising an acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. An acid suppressing agent plus a prokinetic agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutical tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a main factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablet and blend/ granule in a capsule for once a day dosing.<br>
(15)	The compatibility (physical and chemical) study was done taking suitable ratio of Mosapride citrate dihydrate and Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate with the individual excipients and the combination drugs. The sample mixtures were blended and triturated gently in glass mortar and pestle and these were filled in glass vials and sealed with high viscosity polyethylene closures. Few pinholes were made on the cap for maintaining the relative humidity and the vials were placed on 40° C ± 2° C / 75 % ± 5% RH. Samples were analysed on differential scanning calorimeter and visually for initially, and at the interval of 15 days for one month. The results were compared to check the compatibility (physical and chemical) of the drug with excipients. It was found that the vials containing<br>
6<br><br>
drug and excipients blend triturate were satisfactory in appearance as compared to individual control samples.<br>
(016)	In order to screen for formulation stability we have formulated five different types<br>
of process for the formulation. The analysis of pantoprazole part was done by HPLC<br>
(Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 250 mm, Hypersil BDS Ci8, 5 n column using<br>
buffer and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 62:38 respectively and detection was<br>
done at 280 nm. While the analysis of mosapride sustained release part was done by<br>
HPLC (Make: Agilent 1100 series) using 4.6 X 150 mm, Inersil Cg, 5 n column using<br>
buffer and acetonitrile as mobile phase in ratio of 62:38 respectively and detection was<br>
\	done at 275 nm The stability studies were done as per ICH guidelines for 6 months.<br>
Rationale for In vitro dissolution media<br>
(017)	The dissolution testing of pantoprazole enteric coated tablet part was carried out in<br>
0.1 N hydrochloric acid for 2 hrs and in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for 45 minutes. The<br>
quantity of mosapride citrate dihyrate is expressed in terms of equivalent amount of<br>
mosapride citrate. The solubility studies of mosapride citrate dihydrate was carried out as,<br>
in distilled water found to be very slightly soluble, in 0.1 N HC1 and phosphate buffer pH<br>
6.8 practically insoluble while in sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5 it is found to be slightly<br>
soluble, the results are interpreted as per the criteria defined in USP. As per United States<br>
Pharmacopoeia criteria the quantity of the dissolution medium used should be not less<br>
|	than three times that required to form a saturated solution of the drug substance, which<br>
complies when used sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5 for mosapride citrate dihydrate, based on the solubility equilibrium of the drug substance, which complies when used sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5. Hence the dissolution of dosage forms carried out by using 900 ml sodium acetate buffer pH 3.5 which complies with the sink conditions mentioned in USP. However USP allows use of dissolution media up to 2000 ml volume for drugs having limited solubility. (Ref. USP/NF, Vol. 27,2004 Page no. 2514).<br>

Example 1<br>
Pantoprazole 20mg//40 mg delayed release + Mosapride 15 mg sustained release Capsule<br>
(18)	The present invention contains a single unit dosage form of a capsule which contains two parts (tablet and blend/granules in a capsule), first part comprises of a proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and alkalizing agent compressed in tablet and it is enteric coated and second part comprises of the immediate release blend and or granules to provide a loading dose of the mosapride, a prokinetic agent, and sustained release tablet which releases the drug within 8-12 hours to provide a maintenance dose for maintaining prolonged duration of action.<br>
(19)	Pantoprazole enteric coated tablet formulation comprises alkaline excipients. Pantoprazole, mannitol, sodium carbonate anhydrous, crosspovidone, sodium lauryl sulphate, sieved through 60 no. mesh and blended for 5 minutes. HPMC E06 was dissolved in purified water to make 10 % w/v solution and the above blend was granulated. The granules were passed from mesh no. 8, air dried and then dried at 40° C till the loss on drying (LOD) of desired value reached of NMT 3.0 % (Make: Mettler Toledo LJ16 moisture analyzer) at 105° C. The dried granules were sieved through 20 mesh. Finally Crospovidone, Calcium Stearate, Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, Colloidal Silicon dioxide (passed through 60 no. mesh) were added and the whole mixture blended for 5 minutes. The tablets were compressed on 16 station compression machine (Make:Cadmach). The hardness of tablets found to be 3-5 kg/cm2.<br>
