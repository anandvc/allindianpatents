The present invention relates to a portable terminal device, in particular, it relates to that having a configuration capable of improving the light irregularity at the time of irradiating keys with a light by sectioning a printed board into a portion printed/coated with a high reflector (such as a white ink) and a portion printed/coated with a low reflector (such as a black ink) .<br>
FIG. 10 shows an example of arrangement of a key sheet of a conventional portable terminal device. A circuit pattern<br>
2	for electrical connection according to operation of key<br>
buttons, and an LED 3 for irradiating the key buttons with a<br>
light are provided on the printed board 1. The printed board<br>
1 is applied with a white printing 4 (see the portion marked<br>
with slant lines in FIG. 10) except the positions of the circuit<br>
pattern 2 and the LED 3. This method has been used commonly<br>
as a method for improving the luminance at the time of<br>
irradiating keys with a light by applying a white printing 4<br>
on the printed board 1 so as to diffuse the light of the LED<br>
3	disposed on the same surface of the printed board 1.<br>
In this case, since the luminance of the peripheral key buttons are relatively lower with respect to the key buttons disposed in the center array having the LED arranged on the right<br><br>
and the left, the luminance variance (irregularity) is generated when it is viewed as a whole at the time of light irradiation, and thus it is problematic in terms of homogeneity. As a method for improving the same, conventionally, a method shown in FIGS. 11 and 12 has been practiced.  That is, generation of light irregularity has been prevented skillfully by adopting designs of applying the white printing on the rear side of the key buttons close to the LED at the side facing to the key sheet by a larger number of times compared with the other key buttons (see FIG. 11), or by applying the white printing on the entirety of the buttons in the center array, interposed between the LED and applying the white printing only by half of the surface of the peripheral buttons so as to have difference in terms of the light transmissivity (see FIG. 12).<br>
FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of a conventional portable terminal device comprising an upper case 5, a lower case 6, a key pad 7, and a printed board 1 with light emitting elements (LED) 3 mounted thereon, applied with the design shown in FIG. 12. It is shown in FIG. 13 that a white printing 4 is applied on a printed board 1, and a white printing is also applied around the key pad buttons for having difference in terms of the light transmissivity so as to prevent generation of light irregularity.<br>
However, since a method of achieving a light weight of buttons by hollowing the rear side of the buttons in various<br><br>
shapes has been used commonly with the recent trend toward a small size and a light weight, a problem arises in that only the portion remained after hollowing can be printed and thus the light irregularity at the time of light irradiation cannot be improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a portable terminal device for improving the light irregularity at the time of irradiating keys with a light by sectioning a printed board into a portion printed/coated with a high reflector (such as a white ink) and a portion printed/coated with a low reflector (such as a black ink).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be explained with reference to the accompanied drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is an external appearance plan view of a portable terminal device, such as a portable phone according to an<br><br>
embodiment of the invention. Key buttons are shown schematically in the lower half portion of the figure. The invention is for eliminating the light irregularity in the external surface of key buttons as a whole at the time of irradiating the key buttons with a light from below by an LED mounted on a printed board via a translucent key pad 29 (not illustrated in FIG. 1) for facilitating the key button operation in a dark place.<br>
FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the portable phone of FIG. 1.  In FIG. 2, the portable phone comprises a printed board 22 placed on a lower case 21, and an upper case 23 with a key pad 29 (not illustrated in FIG. 2) which is translucent mounted further placed thereon.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the arrangement in the key sheet on the printed board of FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, the printed board comprises a circuit pattern 25 for realizing electric connection based on the key button operation via the key pad 29 (not illustrated in FIG. 3) , an LED 26 for irradiating characters or numbers on the key buttons with a light, a black printing 27 printed/coated with a low reflector for eliminating the light irregularity, and white printings 28, 28 ! printed/coated with a high reflector for eliminating the light irregularity.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the LED 26 are disposed with the equal distance with respect to the center array of the key button arrangement. Therefore, since the key<br><br>
t<br>
- buttons at the right and left arrays receive only the light from the right or left LED 26 whereas the key buttons at the center array receive the light from LED 26 at both right and left arrays, the right irregularity cannot be prevented as it is when the key buttons are irradiated with a light.<br>
Therefore, a black printing (low reflector) 27 is applied to the center key button array to the mounting position of the right and left LED 26, and white printings (high reflector) 28, 28 r are applied to the right or left key button array from the end portion of the key sheet and to the mounting position of the LED 26. Accordingly, a portable terminal device without light irregularity at the time of irradiating keys with a light can be obtained.<br>
FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the portable terminal device according to the invention comprising the upper case 23, the lower case 21, the key pad 29 and the printed board 22 with the light emitting elements 26 mounted thereon explained above.<br>
In FIG. 4, ablackprinting (low reflector) 27 is applied to the center key button array to the mounting position of the right and left LED 26, and white printings (high reflector) 28, 28' are applied to the right or left key button array from the end portion of the key sheet and to the mounting position of the LED 2 6 on the printed board 22. Accordingly, a portable terminal device without light irregularity at the time of<br><br>
irradiating keys with a light can be obtained.<br>
Since only the portion with a character or a number printed transmits a light in a key button, the other peripheral portion of the key button needs not transmit the light. Therefore, in the case the light irregularity countermeasure shown in FIG. 3 is applied, it is adequate that a character or a number is applied or printed in a position of the key button as shown in FIG. 5. That is, a number is applied at the center position of the key button in the example of the center key button arrangement.<br>
On the other hand, in the case a character or a number<br>
is applied or printed at a position leftward with respect to<br>
the center position of the key button as shown in FIG. 6, the<br>
light irregularity is generated with the countermeasure shown<br>
in FIG. 3.  Therefore, as shown in FIG. 7, a black printing (low<br>
reflector) 27 is applied to the key button arrangement in the<br>
center array to the right end of the left side LED array (distance<br>
A from the center line) so that the black printing portion is<br>
provided narrower than the case shown in FIG. 3, and conversely,<br>
the black printing (high reflector) 27 is applied to the key<br>
button arrangement in the center array to the right end of the<br>
right side LED array (distance A + a) so that the black printing<br>
portion is provided wider than the case shown in FIG. 3.<br>
In terms of the white printings (high reflector) 28, 28 !, the white printing (high reflector) 28 is provided narrower<br><br>
than the case shown in FIG. 3, and conversely, the white printing (high reflector) 28' is provide wider than the case shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Accordingly, also in the case characters or numbers are applied or printed leftward with respect to the center position of the key buttons as shown in FIG. 6, a portable terminal device without light irregularity at the time of irradiating keys with a light can be obtained.<br>
It is apparent that the white printing (high reflector) 28 is applied wider than the case shown in FIG. 3 and conversely, the white printing (high reflector) 28' is applied narrower than the case shown in FIG. 3 opposite to the case shown in FIG. 7 in the case characters and numbers are applied rightward with respect to the center position of the key buttons opposite to the case shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, the position of the black printing is opposite to the case shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Moreover, the high reflector and the low reflector can be a sheet material applied with a coloring treatment in white or black. For example, in FIG. 8, a sheet material 30 applied with a coloring treatment of white printings 28, 28' printed/coated with a high reflector and a black printing 27 printed/coated with a low reflector is attached on the plate surface of the key button operation portion of the printed board 22.<br>
The effect the same as the embodiment of printing can<br><br>
be achieved in the configuration of attaching the sheet material applied with a coloring treatment of the high reflector and the low reflector on the printed board 22.<br>
Moreover, as to the range of printing/coating the high reflector and the low reflector, the black printing as the low reflector is not necessarily printed/coated in a strip-like shape in the vicinity of the center as shown in FIGS. 3 and 7, but can be divided in a plurality of portions.<br>
As an example thereof, FIG. 9 shows a configuration with the black printing as the low reflector is provided in two portions in the vicinity of the center. Since the LED are not provided evenly in this embodiment, if the black printing is provided like a strip without disposing in the two portions, the vicinity of the center becomes dark.<br>
Therefore, by providing the black printing portions in a plurality of positions according to the arrangement of the LED, the effect the same as that of the embodiments shown in FIGS . 3 and 7 can be achieved. Moreover, the method of providing the black printing in a plurality of positions can be adopted in the case of the sheet material shown in FIG. 8.<br>
As heretofore explained, a portable terminal device according to the invention comprises an upper case, a lower case, a key pad, and a printed board with light emitting elements mounted thereon, wherein a high reflector is printed/coated on the plate surface of a key switch portion of the printed board,<br><br>
and a low reflector is printed/coated on a part thereof.<br>
Moreover, a portable terminal device according to the invention comprises an upper case, a lower case, a key pad, and a printed board with light emitting elements mounted thereon, wherein a low reflector is printed/coated on the vicinity of the substantial center of the plate surface of a key switch portion of the printed board, and a high reflector is printed/coated on the portion where the low reflector is not printed/coated thereon.<br>
Furthermore, a portable terminal device according to the invention comprises an upper case, a lower case, a key pad, and a printed board with light emitting elements mounted thereon, wherein a high reflector is adhered on the plate surface of a key switch portion of the printed board, and a low reflector is adhered on a part thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the effect of improving the light irregularity at the time of irradiating keys with a light can be achieved in a portable terminal device with a small size and a light weight.<br><br><br><br>
