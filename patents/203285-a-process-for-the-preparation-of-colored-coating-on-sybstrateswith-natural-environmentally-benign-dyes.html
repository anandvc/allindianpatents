				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The  present  invention relates to the  preparation  of color coated glass, fused silica, copper and stainless steel with natural, environmentally benign dyes particularly extracted  from flowers  of  the  hibiscus species for  optical  and  luminescent including fluorescent systems-Coloured  slabs or sheets of glass are used  for  their extensive  application  as colour filters in  optical  equipments including   cameras  or  coloured  glasses   for   architectural, industrial  and other application. Colored glasses are  generally obtained  by melting glasses containing colouring  ions  (salts), homogenizing,  casting  etc.  This  is  an  old  and   wel1-known commerical process. Reference may also be made to the work of  D. Kundu,  P.K.  Biswas  and D. Ssnguli {J.  Non-cryst.  Solids  110 (1989)  133  interference coatings or colorless sheet  glass  for obtaining  wavelength-selective reflection and  consequent  color format.<br>
A drawback of the known processes is the requirement of deposition of a large number of layers of controlled thickness and refractive index, i.e. a precise optical design for obtaining the required color purity; making it a complicated and an expensive process- Another drawback of the conventional process is the difficulty of ensuring the same homogenei ty in case of large area coatings.<br><br>
:  3  :<br>
Reference may be made to the work of A- Duran, J-Mo Fernandez Navarro, P. Casariego and A- Joglar O. Non-cryst. Solids 82 
A drawback of the known processes is the generally poor intensity  of colour. Another drawback is the  color  degradation and  loss  of homogenei ty due to  uncontrolled  precipi tat ion  of certain  transition metal o&gt;iide above threshold levels,  as  also undesirable scattering of light-Reference  may also be made to S. Sakka, K. Kamiya,  K-Makita and Y. Yamamoto -CJ. Mater, Sc i . Letts. 2  395&gt; in  a Bimilar  line,  i.e.  transition metal ions in  silica  sols  for coloured coatings on glass.<br>
A drawback of this work is the generation of a large background  absorption  through the whole range of  the  spectrum<br>
apparently due to the precipitation of colloidal oxides of transition  metals,  and the consequent loss of  control  on  the<br>
colour purity.<br>
Reference may be made to K.T. Bondarev CSteklo I Keramica 12  43 for the preparation of transparent and coloured glass by melting the raw materials.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
The main drawback of the melt route fabrication of coloured 9 less is that the g j ass melting container (varying  from<br>
a tank in a tank furnace) becomes contaminated with the colouring constituents and it becomes difficult or even impossible to  melt<br>
other compositions, especially those for colourless glass, in the same  set up unless repeated washing with suitable melts at  high<br>
temperature is undertaken. This makes the process expensive and time consuming.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Del Nero et al {Materials Research 6 (2003) 7633 dyes like crystal violet and malachite green werr incorporated in polyphosphate for the preparation of colored fi1ms. The drawback is that the system turned to s gel within a minute after completion of mixing, so that preparation of coatings on glass substrates was not possible.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to mitigate the  above  disadvantages  of the  known  processes  and  provide<br>
preparation of colored coatings on sol id substrate with natural, environmentally  benign  dyes  extracted  from  flowers  of   the<br>
hibiscus species for optical and luminescent systems.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to use the dyes in a simple wet chemical solgel technique for preparing the coatings.<br><br>
5<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to use fs  dip  coating  machine  for clipping glass  substrate  into  and pulling it from sol for obtaining coatings at predetermined rates to tailor the colour  characteristics-Yet  another  object  of the present  invention  is  to tailor  the colour characteristics of the coatings by doping  the basic sol wi th sui table cations.<br>
A sti 11 further object of the present invention is to bake the coatings thus prepared at suitable temperature for fixing the  colored coatings of the glass substrate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of colored coatings on glass, fused silica, copper and ostainless steel with natural, environmentally benign dyes extracted from flowers of the hibiscus species for optical and luminescent systems which process comprises preparation of a silica based sol with or without dopant cations for tailoring color of the coatings, extraction of dye molecules from flowers-of the hibiscus species, dispersion of the dye molecules in the silica-based sol, dipping into and pulling from the sol glasE&gt; substrates to obtain a coloured coatings to fi&gt;: them on the glass substrate .<br><br>
:  6  :<br>
In  an  embodiment of the present  invention,  coloured coatings   on  solid  substrates  are  prepared   with   natural, environmentally  benign  dyes  extracted  from  flowers  of   the hibiscus species for optoelectronic and luminescent systems.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, silica based sol with or without dopant cations (for tailoring of color of the coatings) is prepared.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, dye molecules are extracted from flowers of the hibiscus species  and<br>
dispersed in the sol mentioned above.<br>
In sti11 another embodiment of the present invention, solid  substrate  are dipped and pulled from the  sol  to  obtain<br>
coatings of tailored color.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the coated substrates are baked for fixing the colored coatings on the glass substrate.<br>
The process steps were the following:<br><br>
: 7  :<br><i> The coloring agent of the Hibiscus rosa-sinensis flower was extracted by boiling the flower petals in deionised water. At first only ten flowers were used for this purpose? and the net weight of the extracted dye is 0.066 gms. The extracted coloring agent was boiled to nearly six ml deionized water solution<br><ii>   In  another beaker 4-5 gm  of  tetraethyl  ortho silicate <eos gm ethanol water and drops of hc1 were mixed stirred for one hour to prepare the si sol.></eos><iv the mixed sol was used to coat a thin film on></iv>

(vi) The spectral responses of the films were examined using absorption and transmission spectra of the films. A very weak absorption peak was noticed near 535 nm and relatively strong absorption bands were found at 287 and 337 nm. The absorption band position and intensity did not change with the annealing temperature or time. The same experiment was repeated with 50 flowers with 0.329 gms of dyes but the only changp noticed was that the intensity of the absorption bands increased by five times. The abovementioned experiment was again repeated with 100 flowers (the weight of the extracted dye is 0.658 gms), this time the intensity of the absorption bands increased by eleven times. The colour of the films became redish violet.<br><vii in the next step ml ethanol solution of></vii>

:  9  :<br>
solution with annealing temperature fixed at 423K for one hour. This time the color of the fi1m became yel low- The absorption spectra of this film showed a strong absorption band near 306 nm-<br>
