FIELD OF INVENTION :<br>
The present invention is directed to developing a flat plate conveyor furnace for atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition for depositing thin film of TiO2, wherein the substrate can be heated uniformly in order to achieve better uniformity of the deposited film.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
It is well known in the art of depositing thin films, said deposition is achieved by well established technique for thin film deposition by Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). This technique is mainly used where non-hazardous materials are used and also with non-hazardous byproduct, for the deposition of thin films of different thicknesses. APCVD is also a very commonly applied method for the deposition of TiO2 thin films.<br>
Usually in an APCVD furnace the conveyer belt and substrates (on which film is deposited) are heated by infrared (IR) lamp. Conveyer belts are usually made up of metal mesh. This hot metal belt causes non-uniform heating of the substrates because of its mesh type of structure. This type of non-uniform heating of substrate introduces non-uniformity in the deposited film and a mesh like pattern can be observed on deposited film.<br>
There was therefore, the persistent need to develop a method to fabricate a furnace/ heating device that would eliminate the aforedescribed limitations of the APCVD process so as to achieve uniform heating in a conveyer system resulting in consistently uniform thickness of deposited film.<br><br>
THE OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The basic object of the present invention is therefore directed to developing a flat plate conveyor system such that the subtrate can be heated uniformly to obtain better uniformity of the APCVD deposited film.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating, wherein said conveyor system is operated being advantageously driven by spur gear and chain links.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, flat are selectively attached to alternate links of the chain and bars metal plates are attached to alternate flat bars, such that the each plate in upper horizontal position in a operating conveyor gets supported by two flat bars from bottom, at front and back side of the plate.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, said horizontal position of the plates maintained and supported by a pair of flat bars, help maintaining uniform distance from the injection head.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, the holes for linkages of flat bars and metal plates are preferably elliptical holes to avoid bending due to thermal expansion such that the desired uniformity of the deposited film is maintained.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, the plates as well as the subtrates are cooled down after coming out of the hot zone.<br><br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, said flat plate type conveyor helps maintaining uniform temperature of the subtrate spatially and that in turn helps achieving spatial uniformity of the deposited film.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to a conveyor system to achieve said uniformity of heating and that of APCVD deposited film, the present system of heating and deposition when applied for making TiO2 film, improves the quality antireflection coating and improves the absorption ;f light which in turn improves the efficiency of solar cell using such TiO2 film as antireflection coating.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES:<br>
The conveyor furnace of the present invention adapted to provide means for obtaining improved uniformity of heating and deposition of the APCVD deposited film by the conveyer system using spur gear and chain, as developed, are illustrated in the following accompanying figures below.<br>
Reference is first invited to accompanied figure 1, the conveyor is having Flat bars were attached to alternate links of the chain.<br>
Metal plates were attached to alternate flat bars. The links of the chain and the flat bars were designed in a way such that, whenever the plates comes into upward horizontal position it get support from bottom by two flat bars at the front and backside as shown in Figure 1. Here flat plate marked as "A" is attached to flat bar "2" and is being supported by bar "1" at back and by bar "2" at front, both placed at bottom side of plate "A".<br>
This supports by two other flat bars helps to keep the plates horizontal and thus maintain uniform distance from the injection head used for the desired uniformity of APCVD deposition of film.<br>
All the holes through which the flat bars and metal plates were attached to the chain and bars were designed for elliptical holes to avoid bending due to thermal expansion.<br><br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying Figure 2 that illustrates the Lower view of the flat plate conveyer comprising bottom side view of the flat bars connected to chain links and the metal bars they support, before entering into processing zone where it maintains the horizontal flat moving surface of the conveyer of the present invention for desired uniformity of film deposition.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying Figure 3, that illustrates the drive arrangement provided by means of Spur gear and Chain system for the desired horizontal movement of the Flat plate conveyer at the upper level.<br>
The present flat plate conveyer furnace is thus capable of producing thin films by APSVD method maintaining uniformity of heating and also depositing the film uniformly, preferably for the deposition of TiO2 film, favouring improving the quality of antireflection coating making it capable for improving efficiency of solar cells where such films are used, by way of higher light absorption.<br><br>
