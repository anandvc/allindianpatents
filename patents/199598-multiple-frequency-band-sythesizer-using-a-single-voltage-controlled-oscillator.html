Hereinbelow will be described a first embodiment of this invention.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of a first embodiment.<br>
The multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the first embodiment includes a frequency reference signal generation circuit 1 for generating a frequency reference signal (clock signal) lc of which frequency is controlled in<br>
accordance with a reference frequency control signal 13a, a phase comparator 2 for phase-comparing a frequency-divided signal 10a with the frequency reference signal 1c to output a phase difference signal 2a, a low-pass filter 3 for low-pass-filtering the phase difference signal 2a with one of a plurality of cut-off frequencies selected in response to a filter control signal 13b, a voltage controlled oscillator 4 for generating and outputting an oscillation signal in accordance with an output of the low-pass filter 3, a frequency dividing circuit 10 for frequency-dividing the oscillation signal and supplying the frequency-divided signal 10a to the phase comparator 2, and a control circuit 13 for generating the reference frequency control signal 13a and the filter control signal 13b in accordance with a frequency command signal 16.<br>
The frequency divining Circuit 10 frequency-divides the oscillation signal in first and second modes in accordance with a frequency dividing control signal 13c. The frequency dividing circuit 10 frequency-divides the oscillation signal by an integer M in the first mode and frequency-divides the oscillation signal in the second mode such that the oscillation signal is divided by a fraction. That is, in the first mode, an integer frequency dividing operation is effected and in the second mode, a fraction frequency dividing operation is effected.  The control<br>
circuit 13 further generates and supplies the frequency dividing control signal 13c, the integer M, and a constant k for the fraction operation as control data in accordance with the frequency command signal 16.  More specifically, the control circuit 13 generates the reference frequency control signal 13a, the filter control signal 13b, the frequency dividing control signal 13c including the integer M and the constant k in accordance with the frequency command signal 16 using a ROM table included therein.<br>
The low-pass filter 3 includes a loop filter 12 for charging and discharging a constant current for a interval corresponding to a phase difference interval represented by the phase difference signal 2a and a switch 9 controlled in response the filter control signal 13b and a filter circuit 8.  One terminal 9a of the switch 9 is supplied with the phase difference signal 2a.  The filter circuit 8 includes a first capacitor 5 of which one terminal 5a is connected the other terminal 9b of the switch 9 and of which the other terminal 5a is connected to the ground, and a series circuit 8a including a resistor 7 and a second capacitor 6. One end of the series circuit 8a is connected to the other terminal 9b of the switch 9 and the other end of the series circuit 8a is connected to the ground.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a frequency dividing circuit 10 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The frequency dividing circuit 10 includes a frequency divider 15 supplied with the integer M and a dividing control circuit 11 for controlling the frequency divider 15 in the second mode such that the integer M is periodically varied in accordance with the constant k in the frequency dividing control signal 13c.<br>
An operation of the first embodiment will be described.<br>
The reference signal generation circuit 1 generates the frequency reference signal (clock signal) lc.  The frequency of the frequency reference signal is controlled in accordance with the reference frequency control signal 13a.<br>
The phase comparator 2 compares a phase of the frequency-divided signal 10a with a phase of the frequency reference signal 13a and supplies the phase difference signal 2a to the low-pass filter 3.<br>
The low-pass filter 3 effects low-pass-filtering the phase difference signal 2a.  The cut-off frequency is selected from a plurality of the cut-off frequencies in response to the filter control signal 13b.  More specifically, the loop filter 12 of the low-pass filter 3 charges and discharges a constant current for the interval corresponding to the phase difference interval represented by the phase difference signal 2a, so that a cutoff<br>
frequency, that is, a cutoff angular frequency  n1 is provided.  When the switch 9 is made close in response the filter control signal 13b, the filter circuit 8 is added to the input of the loop filter 12, so that the filter circuit 8 acts as a part of the loop filter 12.  It is assumed that the cutoff frequency of the filter circuit 8 is lower than that of the loop filter 12, that is, the passband of the filter circuit 8 is narrower than that of the loop filter 12.  Then, when the switch 9 is made close, the cutoff angular frequency o)  n of the PLL loop is lower than that when the switch is open, so that the passband of the filter circuit 3 can be varied in accordance with the filter control signal 13b.<br>
The voltage controlled oscillator 4 generates and outputs the oscillation signal in accordance with an output of the low-pass filter 3 and outputs a local oscillation signal as the output of the multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the first embodiment.<br>
The frequency dividing circuit 10 effects frequency-dividing the oscillation signal and supplies the frequency-divided signal 10a to the phase comparator 2, so that the PLL feedback loop is provided.<br>
In the frequency dividing circuit 10, in the first mode, it effects the integer frequency dividing operation and in the second mode, it effects the fraction frequency<br>
dividing operation such that the oscillation signal is divided by a fraction.<br>
More specifically, the frequency dividing circuit 10 includes the frequency divider 15 and a dividing control circuit 11.  The dividing control circuit 11 includes an accumulator 103 having an adder 101 and a latch 102.<br>
The dividing control circuit 11 controls a divisor I) for the frequency divider 15 to provide the fraction frequency dividing operation in the second mode such that: the divisor D is varied periodically to equivalently provide a fraction of the divisor.<br>
Fig. 3 is a time chart of the first embodiment showing an operation of the frequency dividing circuit 10 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Assuming that a period 1/fr of the frequency reference signal lc is one clock CLK, the divisor D varies from the integer M to M + 1 every L clocks (interval T), so that an average of the divisor D for the interval T is given by M + 1/L.  The fraction term 1/L can be treated as k/L and k is varied such that k= 0, 1, 2, ••• , so that the divisor D can be set every step of 1/L.  Then, the average divisor Mave is given by:<br>
Mave = M + k/L (0 ≤ k ≤ L, k is an integer)        (1)<br>
This operation is provided by the accumulator 103 having an adder 101 and a latch 102.  In Fig. 2, a value in<br>
the adder 101 increases by k every clock CLK which is the frequency reference signal 1c and when the adder overflows, the adder 101 supplies an overflow signal +1 to the frequency divider, the divisor D becomes M + 1.  If the adder does not supplies the overflow signal +1, the divisor D maintains the integer M.<br>
This fraction frequency dividing operation expands the cutoff angular frequency <y n of the loop so that multiband pll frequency synthesizer first embodiment can operate at a higher speed would only have integer dividing operation.></y>
Moreover, a combination of variation in the low-pass filter 3 and the variation in the frequency dividing circuit 10, that is, the combination of narrow passband and wide passband in the low-pass filter 3 and the integer frequency dividing operation and the fraction frequency dividing operation can provide three cutoff angular frequencies w n of the loop as shown in TABLE 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in table 1, the loop condition can be controlled by controlling only the cutoff frequency and controlled by switching the frequency dividing operation and the combination is possible.  Moreover, as shown in table 1, it is possible that the oscillation signal is outputted from the voltage controlled oscillator at a plurality of frequency bands which may be intermittently arranged in the frequency base or may be continued in the<br>
frequency base.<br>
As mentioned, the frequency of the local oscillation signal can be varied over a relatively wider range stable by adaptively varies the feedback loop condition, that is, the cutoff angular frequency and the frequency dividing-operation, i.e., the integer frequency dividing operation and the fraction frequency dividing operation.<br>
A second embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the second embodiment.<br>
The multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the second embodiment is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment.  The difference is that a voltage controlled oscillation circuit 14 is used instead of the voltage controlled oscillator 4.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of a voltage controlled oscillation circuit 14 shown in Fig. 4.  Fig. 6 is an illustration of the second embodiment showing an example of using the multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the second embodiment.<br>
The voltage controlled oscillation circuit 14 includes a plurality of oscillation circuits 201 and 202 The local oscillation signal is outputted from one of a plurality of the oscillation circuits 201 and 202 in accordance with an oscillation control signal 13d from the control circuit 13.  That is, the control circuit 13 further generates the oscillation control signal 13d in accordance with the frequency command signal 16.<br>
The oscillation circuit 201 is used to oscillate at a range over two different frequency bands A and B.  The oscillation circuit 202 is used to oscillate at further different frequency band C, wherein one of oscillation<br>
circuits 201 and 202 is operated in response to supplying- a power Vcc via a switch 204.  An amplifier 203 amplifies the output of either of the oscillation circuit 201 or 202 to output the local oscillation signal.<br>
The oscillation circuit 201 is used to generate the local oscillation signal at either of frequency band A or B and the oscillation circuit 202 generates the local oscillation signal at a frequency band C.  Therefore, the frequency of the local oscillation signal from the local oscillation circuit 14 is at either of the frequency band A, B, or C.<br>
Table 2 shows designing data of the multiband PLL frequency synthesizer of the second embodiment.<br>
TABLE 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in table 2, in the oscillation circuit 201, the oscillation frequency band is wide, so that VCO controlling sensitivity is different, that is, it is 120 at the frequency band A and it is 80 at the frequency band 3 because a linearity of a variable capacitance diode (not shown) used in the oscillation circuit 201 is not maintained between the frequency bands A and B.<br>
Moreover, because the loop gains K at respective frequency bands are different each other, if the reference<br>
frequency is constant and the cutoff frequency is not changed, it is difficult to provide the same characteristics at respective frequency bands A, B, and C.<br>
More specifically, at frequency band C where the loop gain is lowest, the cutoff angular frequency co n   is low and increases in the order of the frequency band B and frequency band A.  Then, as similar to the first embodiment, the passband of the loop filter is varied and the frequency of frequency reference signal is varied (the frequency dividing mode is changed) every frequency bands to provide three cutoff angular frequencies a&gt;  n in only one PLL loop to optimum the PLL loop every frequency band,<br>
Determination of respective constants in the multiband PLL synthesizer of the second embodiment will be described.<br>
At first, in Fig. 4, the switch 9 is made open to make the low-pass filter a broad band and the integer frequency dividing operation, that is, the first mode, is set.  In this condition, respective constants in the loop filter 12 are determined to obtain a desired characteristic at the frequency band B where the loop gain is secondly largest.  Then, with the frequency dividing mode maintained, that is in the first mode, the switch 9 is made close to make the low-pass filter 3 in a narrow band mode and then, constants of the capacitors 5 and 6, and the resistor 7 in<br>
the filter circuit 8 is determined to provide a desired characteristic at the frequency band A where the loop gain is largest.  Finally, the switch 9 is made open, to provide the filter circuit 3 in a wide band condition, and then, the value of L supplied to the dividing control circuit 11 is determined at the frequency band C where the loop gain in smallest in the fraction frequency dividing operation mode, that is, the second mode.<br>
As mentioned, at the frequency band where the loop gain is large, the reference frequency (frequency dividing mode) and the passbands of the low-pass filter 3 are determined to make the cutoff angular frequency <y n lower. on the other hand at frequency band where loop gain is small reference dividing mode and passbands of low-pass filter are determined to make cutoff angular w higher so that only one pll can provide substantially same characteristic respective bands.></y><br><br><br><br>
