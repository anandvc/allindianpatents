DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a composition as described above.<br>

When R is substituted hydrocarbyl, the substituent may be Ci-io-alkoxy, carbonyl, sulphonyl, carbamoyl, sulphamoyl, halogen, nitrile, ureido, urethane or ester (i.e. -COO- or -OCO-). However, it is much preferred that R is unsubstituted.<br>
The chain represented by (Y)x may contain only one type of CIA-alkyleneoxy repeat unit or it may contain two or more different C2-4-alkyleneoxy repeat units.

When Z is the residue of a polyamine it is preferably polyvinylamine or polyallylamine. Polyallylamine and poly(N-alkyl)allylamines of differing molecular weight are commercially available from Nitto Boseki. Polyvinylamine of differing molecular weight are available from Mitsubishi Kasei.<br>
When Z is the residue of a polyimine it is preferably poly (C2_6-alkyleneimine) and especially polyethyleneimine (PEI). The polyimine may be linear or especially branched. Linear polyethyleneimine may be prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(N-acyl) alkyleneimines as described, for example, by Takeo Saegusa et al in Macromolecules, 1972, Vol 5, page 4470. Branched polyethyleneimines of differing molecular weight are commercially available from BASF and Nippon Shokubai. Polypropyleneimine dendrimers are commercially available from DSM Fine Chemicals and poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are available as "Starburst" dendrimers from Aldrich Chemical Company.<br>

In the case of polyethyleneimine, the number-average molecular weight is preferably not less than 1500, more preferably not less than 3,000 and especially not less than 5,000.<br>
The residue of dibasic acid represented by A and A1 may be derived from any dibasic acid of formula HOOC-B-COOH or anhydride thereof wherein B is a<br><br>
direct bond or a divalent organic moiety containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably if A is derived from an aliphatic dibasic acid or anhydride of the given formula, then B is fully saturated (i.e. it does not include a carbon to carbon double bond). Optionally A1 is derived from an aliphatic dibasic acid or anhydride thereof, then the B used for A1 is fully saturated. B may be aromatic, hetero aromatic, alicyclic or aliphatic which may be optionally substituted. When B is aliphatic containing two or more carbon atoms, it may be linear or branched, saturated (as earlier expressed saturated is preferred, especially for B units going into A) or unsaturated. Preferably B is unsubstituted. It is also preferred that B contains not greater than 12 and especially not greater than 8 carbon atoms. Unsaturated aliphatic B units (such as used to make maleic anhydride) have been associated with highly gelled reaction products under some reaction conditions.<br>

Preferred anhydrides are glutaric, succinic and phthalic anhydrides.<br>
Mixtures of dibasic acids or anhydrides thereof may be used. Thus A may be the residue of one or more than one different dibasic acid or anhydride. However, it is preferred that A is the residue of a single dibasic acid or anhydride. Similarly, A1 may be the residue of one or more than one different dibasic acid or anhydride. Again, it is preferred that A1 is the residue of a single dibasic acid or anhydride. It is also preferred that both A and A1 are the residue of the same dibasic acid or anhydride. It is much preferred that A and/or A1 is the residue of succinic anhydride.<br>
When W is the residue of an oxide any of the amino or imino groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- may be converted to a N-oxide by reaction with oxygen (including air) or a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide or ammonium persulphate.<br>
Similarly when W is the residue of urea the number of free amino and/or imino groups in Z which are reacted with urea may vary over wide limits up to the<br><br>
maximum number of amino or imino groups which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A-.<br>
In the specific case where W is the residue of a dibasic acid or anhydride it is much preferred that the majority of free amino or imino groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A are reacted with the dibasic acid or anhydride represented by A1.<br>
Thus, when p is other than zero in formula la it is preferred that the majority of amine/imine groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- carry the residue - A1 -OH.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the polyamine or polyimine represented by Z preferably carries 2 or more groups RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- which may be the same or different. Dispersants of this type may be conveniently represented by Formula (2):<br>

B is also derivable from a lactone such as /3-propiolactone, optionally Ci_6-alkyl substituted e-caprolactone and optionally Ci-6-alkyl substituted 5-valerolactone. Specific examples are e-caprolactone and the 7-methyl-, 3-methyl-, 5-methyl-, 6-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 5-tetra-butyl-, 4,4,6-trimethyl- and 4,6,6-trimethyl-s-caprolactone and 5-valerolactone.<br>
The ratio of q to s is preferably from 6:1 to 1:6.<br>
As noted hereinbefore the dispersant may be present in the form of a salt. Where the dispersant contains a carboxylic acid group the salt may be that of an alkali metal such as lithium, potassium or sodium. Alternatively the salt may be formed with ammonia, an amine or quaternary ammonium cation. Examples of amines are methylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, hexylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine and octadecylamine. The quaternary ammonium cation may be a quaternary ammonium cation or a benzalkonium cation. The quaternary ammonium cation preferably contains one or two alkyl groups containing from 6 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of quaternary ammonium cations are tetraethyl ammonium, N-octadecyl-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium; N,N-didodecyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium, N-benzyl-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium and N-benzyl-N-octadecyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium cation.<br>
It is much preferred that the dispersant containing a carboxylic acid group is in the form of a free acid.<br>
The dispersant of formula 1 where v is zero may be in the form of a salt of a coloured acid. The coloured acid may be any anionic dyestuff such as sulphonated phthalocyanine, especially a copper or nickel phthalocyanine or a disazo dyestuff containing a sulphonic acid and/or carboxylic acid group.<br><br>
When v is zero some of the amine/imine groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- may be quaternised. Preferred quaternisation agents are dimethyl sulphate, benzyl chloride, methyl halides especially chlorine, bromine and iodine, methyl-p-toluene sulphonate and propane sultone.<br>
The compound of Formula (1) may be made by any method known to the art. It is preferably prepared by the reaction of a compound of Formula (3) with a dibasic acid or more preferably anhydride thereof and a polyamine and/or a polyimine and optionally a second dibasic acid or preferably anhydride thereof.<br>
RO-(Y)X-T-NH2 Formula (3)<br>
wherein R, Y, T and x are as described hereinbefore.<br>
Preferably the compound of Formula (3) is reacted with the first dibasic acid or anhydride at a temperature from 40 to 150°C, more preferably from 60 to 100°C. The reaction is preferably performed in an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere may be provided by any inert gas of the Periodic Table but is preferably nitrogen.<br>
The reaction with the polyamine and/or polyimine is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 100 to 200°C. Under such conditions the reaction results in a mixture of amide and salt forms rather than the salt form alone.<br>
The reaction involving the optional second dibasic acid or preferably anhydride thereof is preferably carried out using similar conditions to those employed using the first dibasic acid or anhydride thereof<br>
The reaction involving the first and the second dibasic acid or anhydride thereof may be carried out in the presence of an organic diluent which is inert to the reactants. Similarly, the reaction between the compound of formula 3 and the dibasic acid or anhydride thereof and the polyamine and/or polyimine may also be carried out in the presence of an organic diluent. Preferably, the organic diluent is a solvent for the reactants. The organic diluent may be aromatic or aliphatic including halogenated derivatives. Examples are toluene, chlorobenzene, heptane and<br><br>
petroleum ether distillates. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the absence of an organic diluent.<br>
When W is the residue of an oxide the number of amino and/or imine groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- may vary over wide limits. Such dispersants are easily prepared by reacting dispersants containing free amino and/or imino groups with an oxidising compound such as oxygen (or air) or a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide or ammonium persulphate. Similarly, when W is the residue of urea such dispersants may also be readily prepared by reacting any free amino and/or imino groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- with urea. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert atmosphere at a temperature between 80 and 140°C.<br>
In the specific case where W is the residue of a dibasic acid or anhydride thereof it is much preferred that the majority of amino and/or imino groups in Z which do not carry the group RO-(Y)X-T-NH-A- are reacted with the dibasic acid or anhydride.<br>
The particulate solid present in the composition may be any inorganic or organic solid material which is substantially insoluble in the organic medium. Preferably the particulate solid is a pigment.<br>
Examples of suitable solids are pigments for solvent inks; pigments, extenders and fillers for paints and plastics materials; disperse dyes; optical brightening agents and textile auxiliaries for solvent dyebaths, inks and other solvent application systems; solids for oil-based and inverse-emulsion drilling muds; dirt and solid particles in dry cleaning fluids; particulate ceramic materials; magnetic materials and magnetic recording media; fibres such as glass, steel, carbon and boron for composite materials, and biocides, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals which are applied as dispersions in organic media.<br>
A preferred solid is an organic pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments described, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colour Index (1971) and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed "Pigments". Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, condensed azo, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthanthrone, anthraquinone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendioxazine, quinacridone and<br><br><br>
phthalocyanine series, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes. Carbon black, although strictly inorganic, behaves more like an organic pigment in its dispersing properties. Preferred organic pigments are phthalocyanines, especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthranthrones, quinacridones and carbon blacks.<br>
Preferred inorganic solids include: extenders and fillers such as talc, kaolin, silica, barytes and chalk; particulate ceramic materials such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide, mixed silicon-aluminium nitrides and metal titanates; particulate magnetic materials such as the magnetic oxides of transition metals, especially iron and chromium, e.g. gamma-FeaCh, Fe3O4, and cobalt-doped iron oxides, calcium oxide, ferrites, especially barium ferrites; and metal particles, especially metallic iron, nickel, cobalt, copper and alloys thereof.<br>
Other useful solid materials include agrochemicals such as the fungicides flutriafen, carbendazim, chlorothalonil and mancozeb.<br>
The organic medium present in the composition of the invention is preferably a plastics material, more preferably an organic liquid. The organic liquid may be a non-polar or more preferably a polar organic liquid. By the term "polar" in relation to the organic liquid it is meant that an organic liquid is capable of forming moderate to strong bonds as described in the article entitled "A Three Dimensional Approach to Solubility" by Crowley et al in Journal of Paint Technology, Vol. 38, 1966, at page 269. Such organic liquids generally have a hydrogen bonding number of 5 or more as defined in the abovementioned article.<br>
Examples of suitable polar organic liquids are amines, ethers, especially lower alkyl ethers, organic acids, esters, ketones, glycols, alcohols and amides. Numerous specific examples of such moderately strongly hydrogen bonding liquids are given in the book entitled "Compatibility and Solubility" by Ibert Mellan (published in 1968 by Noyes Development Corporation) in Table 2.14 on pages 39-40 and these liquids all fall within the scope of the term polar organic liquid as used herein.<br>
