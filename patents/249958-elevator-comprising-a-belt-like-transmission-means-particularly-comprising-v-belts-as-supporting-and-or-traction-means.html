Lift with belt-like transmission means, particularly with wedge-ribbed belt, as support means and/or drive means<br>
The subject of the invention is a lift system and a belt-like transmission means as defined in the patent claims.<br>
Lift systems of this kind usually comprise a lift cage which is movable in a lift shaft or freely along guide equipment. For producing the movement the lift system comprises a drive which co-operates with the lift cage and a compensating weight (also termed counterweight) byway of transmission means.<br>
Distinction is made between lift systems in which steel cables of round cross-section are used as transmission means and more modern lift systems which have flat belts as transmission means.<br>
An example of a lift system with flat transmission means is known from PCT Patent Application WO 99/43602. The lift cage according to this patent application is moved by a drive which is seated at the compensating weight and moves together with the weight.<br>
The described system has the disadvantage that the belt used as transmission means does not have the optimum traction behaviour achievable with specific other belt-like transmission means and that the supply of energy to the drive motor, as also the transmission of signals from associated control and regulating devices, has to take place by way of long, flexible cables.<br>
A further lift system with cogged-belt-like transmission means is known from PCT Patent Application WO 99/43592. In the described and claimed arrangement the drive is integrated in the counterweight and a cogged-belt-like transmission means fixed in the lift shaft serves for transmission of the drive force between counterweight and lift shaft. Since the lift cage and the compensating weight hang at an actual support means separate from the mentioned cogged-belt-like transmission means, the drive and transmission means transmit only the force difference between the counterweight and the weight of the lift cage.<br><br>
This system has the same disadvantages as that described in the foregoing and has the additional disadvantage that a cogged belt is used for the drive function and a different means for the support function. By comparison with a system in which the drive function and support function are effected by the same means, in this system there is also required a greater number of rollers or pulleys.<br>
Another form of lift system with cogged-belt-like transmission means is known from US Patent 5 191 920. In the illustrated lift system the cogged-belt-like transmission means is stationary in the lift shaft. The drive unit is disposed at the lift cage or at the so-termed load receiving means.<br>
This system therefore has the same disadvantages as described in WO 99/43602. An additional disadvantage here is that due to the lift drive the weight of the load receiving means and thus the drive power required are increased.<br>
The belts disclosed in the stated documents have specific disadvantages. Flat belts have, in lift equipment with lift cages which are light by comparison with the useful load, an insufficient traction capability. In the case of cogged belts the problem exists that these do not slip on the drive pulley when the lift cage or the counterweight rests, as a consequence of a control breakdown, on their end position buffers. Moreover, centring of the belt on the belt pulleys cannot be realised without problems. In a given case special measures have to be undertaken at the pulleys in order to prevent the belt from running out of the central position.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to be seen in creating an improved lift system of the kind stated in the introduction which reduces or avoids the disadvantages of the known systems.<br>
Fulfilment of this object is defined in the patent claims.<br>
The lift system according to the invention comprises a lift cage, a drive, belt-like transmission means, preferably a wedge-ribbed belt, and a counterweight. The drive is stationary and the transmission means co-operate with the drive in order to move the lift cage by transmission of a force.<br><br>

Detailed description<br>
In the following forms of embodiment there are preferably used so-termed wedge-ribbed belts, also called wedge rib belts. Such a wedge-ribbed belt can advantageously be used as a friction-coupling (adhesion-coupling) support element and/or drive element (transmission means) for a lift cage with a counterweight. The wedge-ribbed belt enables, in the case of running characteristics similar to a flat belt, a higher cable force ratio due to its form. In the case of a belt driven by a belt pulley a high cable force ratio means that the tensile force in the run of the belt running (drawn) onto the belt pulley can be substantially higher than in the run simultaneously running away from the belt pulley. With use of a wedge-ribbed belt as transmission means for a lift cage with a counterweight this advantage has the result that even a lift cage of very light construction can co-operate with a much heavier counterweight without the transmission means slipping on the drive pulley.<br>
As shown in Figs. 13 to 15, the wedge-ribbed belt 13 has several wedge-shaped grooves 5 and wedge ribs 6 arranged parallelly in longitudinal direction. These wedge-shaped grooves 5 and wedge ribs 6 enable, due to their wedge effect, a cable force ratio of more than 2 for a looping angle of 180 degrees.<br><br>
It is a further advantage of the wedge-ribbed belt 13 that it is self-centring on the pulleys driving or guiding it. The wedge-ribbed belt 13 is preferably provided on the rear side (i.e. on the side which does not have any wedge-shaped grooves 5 or wedge ribs 6) with a guide rib 2, as shown in Fig. 15. This guide rib 2 has the task, in the case of opposite bending of the wedge-ribbed belt, i.e. when this runs around a pulley by the belt rear side oriented towards the pulley, of guiding the wedge-ribbed belt in a guide groove present in the running surface of the pulley.<br>
It is of advantage for the use according to the invention if the wedge-shaped grooves 5 of the wedge-ribbed belt 13 have a groove angle b of 80 degrees to 100 degrees. The groove angle b is preferably approximately 90 degrees. This groove angle b is substantially larger than in conventional wedge-ribbed belts. Due to the larger groove angle b there is achieved a reduction in running noise. The self-centring characteristic is, however, retained, as is an increased cable force ratio as defined in the foregoing.<br>
In a further form of embodiment the wedge-ribbed belt 13 is provided on the rear side, as shown in Fig. 13, with a layer 4 which preferably has good sliding properties. This layer 4 can be, for example, a fabric layer. This facilitates mounting in the case of lift systems with multiple suspension.<br>
A further wedge-ribbed belt 13 is shown in Fig. 14. This wedge-ribbed belt has not only wedge-shaped grooves 5 and ribs 6, which are laid in longitudinal direction, but also transverse grooves 3. These transverse grooves 3 improve the bending flexibility of the wedge-ribbed belt so that this can co-operate with belt pulleys with reduced diameter.<br>
In Figs. 13, 14 and 15 it can also be recognised that the transmission means (wedge-ribbed belt 13) contains tensile carriers 1 which are oriented in the longitudinal direction thereof and which consist of metallic strands (for example, steel strands) or non-metallic strands (for example, of chemical fibres). Such tensile carriers 1 impart to the transmission means according to the invention the requisite tensile strength and/or longitudinal stiffness. A preferred form of embodiment of the transmission means contains tensile carriers 1 of 'Zylon' fibres. 'Zylon' is a trade name of the company Toyobo Co. Ltd., Japan, and concerns chemical fibres of poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole) (PBO). These fibres exceed, in terms of the characteristics decisive for the application according to the invention, those of steel strands and of other known fibres.  The elongation and the<br><br>
metre weight of the transmission means can be reduced by use of 'Zylon' fibres, wherein the breakage strain at the same time turns out to be higher.<br>
Ideally, the tensile carriers 1 should be so embedded in the wedge-ribbed belt that adjacent fibres or strands are not in contact. A degree of filling, i.e. a ratio between the overall cross-section of all tensile carriers and the cross-section of the belt, of at least 20% has proved ideal.<br>
Fig. 16 shows a form of embodiment, which is equally suitable as transmission means for lift systems, of the wedge-ribbed belt 13. Instead of the tensile carriers, which were mentioned in connection with Figs. 13 to 15, of metallic or non-metallic strands, here an areal tensile layer 51 forms the core of the wedge-ribbed belt 13, wherein this tensile layer 51 extends substantially over the entire belt length and the entire belt width. The tensile layer 51 can consist of an unreinforced material layer, for example of a polyamide film, or of a film reinforced by chemical fibres. Such a reinforced film could contain, for example, the afore-mentioned 'Zylon' fibres embedded in a suitable synthetic material matrix.<br>
The tensile layer 51 imparts to the flat belt the requisite tensile strength and creep resistance, but is also sufficiently flexible in order to be able to bear a sufficiently high number of bending processes during deflection around a belt pulley. The wedge-ribbed layer 53 can consist of, for example, polyurethane or of an NBR elastomer (Nitrile Butadiene Rubber) and is connected over the whole area or part of the area and directly or by way of an intermediate layer with the tensile layer 51. The rear side of the wedge-ribbed belt has a cover layer 54 which, like the wedge-ribbed layer, is connected with the tensile layer 51 and which is advantageously executed as a slide covering. Intermediate layers (not illustrated here) can be present between the stated principal layers, which intermediate layers impart the necessary adhesion between the stated layers and/or increase the flexibility of the transmission means. This wedge-ribbed belt provided with a whole-area tensile layer can also have a guide rib as already described in connection with Fig. 15.<br>
A further transmission means which is usable in lift systems and which is suitable for fulfilling the task according to the invention is illustrated in Fig. 17. In that case it is a flat belt 50 built up from several layers of different materials. The flat belt contains in the core at least one areal tensile layer 51  which consists of, for example, an unreinforced<br><br>
polyamide film or of a synthetic material film reinforced with chemical fibres embedded in the synthetic material matrix. This tensile layer 51 imparts to the flat belt the requisite tensile strength and creep resistance, but is also sufficiently flexible in order to be able to bear a sufficiently high number of bending processes during deflection around a belt pulley. In addition, the flat belt 50 has an external friction layer 55 at the front side, for example of an NBR elastomer (Nitrile Butadiene Rubber), as well as an external cover layer 51 at the rear side, which is executed, depending on the respective lift system, as a friction covering or a slide covering. Intermediate layers 56 can be present between the stated principal layers, which intermediate layers impart the requisite adhesion between the stated layers and/or increase the flexibility of the flat belt. For the purpose of optimisation of the afore-mentioned cable force ratio, friction layers with coefficients of friction of 0.5 to 0.7 relative to steel pulleys are available, which are, moreover, very wear-resistant. Lateral guidance of the flat belt 50 is usually ensured, as illustrated in Fig. 18, by flange discs 57 mounted at the pulley 16, possibly in combination with a dishing of the pulley running surfaces.<br>
A first form of embodiment of a lift system 10 according to the invention is illustrated in Figs. 1A and 1B. Fig. 1A shows a section through the head end of the lift shaft 11. The lift cage 12 as also a counterweight 15 are moved within the shaft 11 by way of a wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13. For this purpose there is provided a stationary drive 14 which acts on the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 by way of a drive pulley 16.1. The drive 14 is mounted on a bracket 9 which is supported on or at one or more guide rails 18 of the lift system. In another form of embodiment the bracket 9 can be supported in or at the shaft wall. The wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 is fixed at one of its ends in the region of the bracket 9, leads from this fixing point downwardly to a suspension pulley 16.2 of a counterweight 15, loops around this suspension pulley 16.2, leads upwardly to the drive pulley 16.1, loops around this, leads downwardly to a first deflecting pulley 16.3 mounted below the lift cage 12 and at this, from there horizontally below the lift cage 12 through to a second deflecting pulley 16.3 mounted below the lift cage 12 and at this, and subsequently upwards again to a second fixing point designated as support structure 8. Depending on the respective direction of rotation of the drive 14 the cage 12 is moved upwardly or downwardly by way of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13.<br><br>
The guide plane 20 formed by the two cage guide rails 18 is, as shown in Fig. 1B, turned through an angle a of 15 to 20 degrees relative to the strand of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 running through below the lift cage 12, i.e. relative to the transverse axis of the lift cage 12. The cage guide rails can thereby be placed outside the space occupied by the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 and the belt pulleys, whereby it is achieved that on the one hand the axis of the strand of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 running through below the lift cage 12 can be arranged underneath the cage centre of gravity S when this lies in the guide plane formed by the cage guide rails 18. In addition, the occupied shaft width is thus minimised.<br>
With the arrangement of the strand, which runs through below the lift cage 12, of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 below the cage centre of gravity S the guide forces arising between lift cage 12 and cage guide rails 18 are kept as small as possible in normal operation and due to the fact that the centre of gravity S lies in the guide plane 20 the guide forces are minimised when the safety brakes act on the cage guide rails 18.<br>
In the case of the illustrated arrangement of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13, the suspension pulley 16.2 and the deflecting pulleys 16.3, which are mounted below the lift cage 12, there results a ratio of wedge-ribbed belt speed to cage and counterweight speed of 2:1 (2:1 suspension). By comparison with a 1:1 suspension the torque to be applied by the drive 14 is thereby reduced by half.<br>
Since the minimum radius, which is required in the case of wedge-ribbed belts, of drive and deflecting pulleys is substantially smaller than in the case of the steel wire support cables previously usual in lift construction, several advantages result. Thanks to appropriately reduced diameter of the drive pulley 16.1, the torque required at the drive 14 and thus the dimensions of the drive reduce. As a result, and thanks to the deflecting pulleys 16.2 and 16.3 similarly reduced in their diameters, the form of construction and arrangement of the lift as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 is relatively compact and can be accommodated, as shown, in the shaft 11. The small size of the deflecting pulleys 16.3, which are mounted at the cage 12, allows the substructure, which is usually designated as base 17, below the lift cage 12 in which these deflecting pulleys 16.3 are installed to be constructed with small dimensions. Preferably, this base 17 together with the deflecting pulleys 16.3 can even be integrated in the cage floor.<br><br>
A cross-section through a similar form of embodiment is shown in Fig. 2. The lift cage 12 is moved within the shaft 11 by way of a wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13. For this purpose there is provided a stationary drive 14 which drives the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13. Several pulleys are provided in order to correspondingly guide the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13. In the illustrated example of embodiment the drive 14 is mounted in stationary location above the upper end position of the counterweight 15. The drive 14 is mounted on a bracket 9 which is supported on or at one or more guide rails 18 of the lift system 10. In the illustrated example the base 17 lies at right angles to the side walls of the lift shaft 11 in the plane of the drawing. Due to the arrangement of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 below the cage centre of gravity S, only small guide forces arise at the cage guide rails 18. This second form of embodiment is otherwise substantially the same as the first form of embodiment. The cage guide rails 18 are arranged eccentrically, i.e. the guide plane 20 is disposed between the cage door 7 and the centre of gravity S of the lift cage 12, which in the illustrated case lies on the centre axis of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13. In the illustrated embodiment the counterweight 15 is suspended 2:1 (2:1 suspension) by the deflecting pulley 16.2 and the cage 12 with the deflecting pulleys 16.3.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross-section through a further form of embodiment of a lift system 10. The drive 14 is supported on the counterweight rails 19 and on one of the cage rails 18. On the opposite side the fixing point of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 is supported on the second cage rail 18. Cage 12 and counterweight 15 are also suspended 2:1 in this form of embodiment. The diagonal course of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 makes the advantages described in connection with Fig. 2 possible for a cage 12 which is centrally guided and centrally suspended with respect to the cage centre of gravity S.<br>
In the case of a further form of embodiment, which is shown in Fig. 4, the drive 14 is supported on the two counterweight rails 19 and on a lift rail 18. On the opposite side, the fixing point for the ends, which are to be fixed here, of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 is supported on the second cage rail 18. The drive 14 is connected with two drive pulleys 16.1. Two strands of wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13.1 and 13.2, which run parallel to one another, are provided. In this form of embodiment, too, cage 12 and counterweight 15 are suspended 2:1. The division of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means into two parallel strands 13.1 and 13.2 enables a central guidance<br><br>
and a suspension, which is central with respect to the cage centre of gravity S, of the lift cage 12, with the advantages described in connection with Fig. 2.<br>
Another form of arrangement 10 is shown in Figs. 5A and 5B. The drive 14 is arranged outside the cage projection above the upper end position of the counterweight 15. The drive can, as also in the foregoing examples of embodiment, comprise a synchronous or an asynchronous motor. The drive 14 is preferably placed on a beam which rests on or at the guide rails 18 of the cage 12 and the guides 19 for the counterweight 15. In this form of embodiment, cage 12 and counterweight 15 are suspended 1:1. The wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 is arranged half on the left and half on the right of the lift cage 12. The first half 13.1 of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 11 leads from the counterweight 15 oyer the drive pulley 16.2 to a fixing point present at the lift cage 12 in the vicinity of the floor. The second half 13.2 of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means<br>
13	leads from the counterweight 15 over the drive pulley 16.1 along the shaft roof 21<br>
above the cage 12. There it is deflected by a deflecting pulley 16.4 and led to a second<br>
fixing point present at the lift cage 12 in the vicinity of the floor. The two guide rails 18 are<br>
preferably connected together at the upper end (for example, by way of a transverse beam<br>
24) in order to accept the horizontally directed belt force. The wedge-ribbed belt<br>
transmission means 13 and the guide plane 20 of the lift cage 12 are arranged<br>
symmetrically with respect to the axis with the cage centre of gravity S. Its spacing from<br>
this axis is small in order to keep the guide forces, on the one hand in normal operation<br>
and on the other hand on engagement of a safety brake device, small.<br>
In Fig. 5C there are shown details of a drive 14 which is a component of a lift system, which is without an engine room, according to Figs. 5A and 5B. The drive 14 comprises a motor 40 which is connected by a shaft 45 with the drive pulley 16.1. The illustrated drive<br>
14	is very compact. The wedge-ribbed belt 13 can loop around the drive pulley 16.1 by<br>
180 degrees or only by 90 degrees, depending on the direction in which the wedge-ribbed<br>
belt is to be led away from the drive pulley 16.1.<br>
A further form of embodiment is shown in Figs. 6A and 6B. The drive 14 is arranged above the lift shaft door 7 between the shaft inner wall 21 and the shaft outer wall 22. This is possible without further measures, since the diameter of the drive 14 is smaller than the shaft wall thickness D. The drive 14 can, as in the case of the other forms of embodiment, be designed as a synchronous or an asynchronous motor. Advantageously, a small mass<br><br>
system, i.e. a drive with a low mass moment of inertia, is used as drive. The drive is provided at each of the two ends with a respective drive pulley 16.1. Not only the drive pulleys 16.1, but also the drive 14 can be fastened to a common support 43. The system 10 is equipped with two counterweights 15 which are each arranged on a respective side of the lift cage 12. The wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 are arranged symmetrically on the lefthand and the righthand side of the lift cage 12. First runs of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 lead out from the drive pulleys 16.1 to first deflecting pulleys 16.5 fixedly mounted at the same height, out from these downwardly to deflecting pulleys 16.6 mounted on both sides of the lift cage 12, loop around these and lead upwardly to fixing points 25.1. Second runs of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13 lead from the drive pulleys 16.1 out to second deflecting pulleys 16.7 fixedly mounted at the same height, out from these downwardly to deflecting pulleys 16.8 mounted at the counterweights 15, loop around these and lead upwardly to fixing points 25.2. Above the space occupied by the counterweight 15 in its uppermost position there are mounted on both sides of the lift cage 12 a respective beam 44 on the counterweight guide rails 19 and the cage guide rails 18, which beams 44 carry the deflecting pulleys 16.5 and 16.7 as well as the fixing points 25.1 and 25.2. The beams 44 can form, together with the support 43 of the drive 14, a U-shaped support structure. Horizontally and vertically acting forces are thus not transmitted to the shaft structure. The cage guide rails 18 and the deflecting pulleys 16.6 fastened to the lift cage 12 are arranged, in the direction of the cage depth, as close as possible to the cage centre of gravity S, so that the guide forces in normal operation as also in safety braking remain small.<br>
In Fig. 6C there are shown details of a first drive 14 which is a component of a lift system, without an engine room, according to Figs. 6A and 6B. The drive 14 comprises a motor 40 and one or two brakes 41. The two drive pulleys 16.1 are connected by carrier elements 44 with the support 43. Insulated torque supports 42 serve for fastening the motor 40 to the support 43. The shaft 45 is constructed to be continuous. The illustrated drive has low rotating masses and, due to its small constructional size, is suitable for installation in the lift shaft.<br>
In Fig. 6D there are shown details of a second drive 14 which is a component of a lift system, without an engine room, according to Figs. 6A and 6B. The illustrated drive 14 has a divided shaft 46 which is provided with two coupling elements 47.    This drive<br><br>
otherwise corresponds with the drive shown in Fig. 6C. Maintenance of the drive 14 can be carried out from the shaft interior.<br>
A development of the form of embodiment according to Figs. 6A and 6B is shown in Figs. 7A and 7B. The form of embodiment differs in that two separate drives 14.1 and 14.2 are provided. The cage 12 and the counterweights 15 are suspended 2:1. The side view in Figure 7B shows the bending, which is always in the same sense, of the wedge-ribbed belt transmission means 13, which counteracts premature wear thereof.<br>
In the case of the previously described forms of embodiment the function of the drive and the function of the support are combined in each instance. For this reason the term transmission means was also used for reference to the function of the wedge-ribbed belt.<br>
In the following forms of embodiment the function of the support and the function of the drive are constructed separately. In other words, there are separate support means and drive means.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a first such form of embodiment. The cage 12 and the counterweight 15 are connected together by support means 33 in the form of cables (for example steel cables, aramide cables), flat belts, cogged belts or chains. A deflecting pulley 31 is provided at the shaft head and can be supported on the guide rails (not illustrated). The drive 14 is disposed at the shaft base 32. The drive 14 moves the cage 12 by means of wedge-ribbed belt drive means 13. The wedge-ribbed belt drive means 13 is connected at one end with the lower side of the counterweight 15. The necessary clamping force can be produced, for example, by means of a compression spring 34 or by a corresponding counterweight.<br>
The form of embodiment 30 shown in Fig. 9 substantially corresponds with the form of embodiment shown in Fig. 8. A difference consists in that the drive 14 has a speed reduction means 35. Thus a smaller drive 14 can be used. The drive 14 can be coupled with the speed reduction means 35 by way of a V-belt or similar.<br>
A further refinement of the invention is shown in Figs. 10A and 10B. The counterweight 15 is connected with the lift cage 12 1:1 by way of a support means 33 and several deflecting pulleys 31.  The support means 33 can be fastened either only on the left to the lift cage<br><br>
connections fulfil a pure supporting function. The drive 14 is disposed above the counterweight 15 and is carried by a support 37 preferably fastened to the guide rails 18, 19. The counterweight 15 compensates for 100% of the cage weight and a part of the useful load. A wedge-ribbed belt 13 is directly fastened at the top to the counterweight 15 (suspension 1:1), deflected through 180 degrees over the drive pulley 16.1 and led to the tensioning roller 38 disposed at the shaft base 32. The tensioning roller 38 deflects the wedge-ribbed belt 13 again through 180 degrees, whereafter this is led upwardly to the lower end of the counterweight 15 and is fastened there. The tensioning roller 38 can be incorporated in a lever mechanism 39 which tightens the wedge-ribbed belt 33 by means of a spring or weight force.<br>
The form of embodiment according to Figs. 10A and 10B can be modified in that, for example, the wedge-ribbed belt 13 is so guided by suitable arrangement of pulleys that it forms a so-termed 2:1 suspension, by way of which the drive 14 drives the counterweight 15 (as described in connection with Fig. 1A). The necessary maximum torque of the drive can thus be halved.<br>
A further form of embodiment is shown in Fig. 11. The drive 14 is disposed, in the case of the illustrated example, between the lift cage 12 and the wall of the shaft 11. The lift cage 12 and the counterweight 15 are guided on common guide rails 18. For this purpose, these rails have a special profile. Drive pulleys 16.1 can be provided either on both sides of the drive 14 or only on one side of the drive 14. In Fig. 12 there is illustrated a 1:1 suspension. An embodiment with 2:1 suspension is possible if the wedge-ribbed belts 13 are, as illustrated by way of example in Fig. 1, led through under the lift cage 12 and fixed on the other cage side in the shaft head.<br>
A further compact drive 14 is shown in Fig. 12. This drive 14 is distinguished by the fact that it comprises two drive pulleys 16.1. The drive 14 additionally comprises a motor 40, a brake 41 and a continuous shaft 45. The two drive pulleys 16.1 are each seated at a respective end of the shaft 45. The drive 14 is particularly designed for installation to lie laterally above the cage 12.<br>
In a further form of embodiment the wedge-ribbed belt has teeth which are constructed to be highly wear-resistant.<br><br>
According to the invention either the stationary drive is accommodated in an engine room or the drive is disposed in or at the lift shaft.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
