In addition, production method 3 discloses a method of introducing a substituent after 4-oxoquinoline ring formation, and production method 4 describes example of a more specific production method of compound [12] . [0027]<br>
In addition, patent reference 1 discloses, of compound [II], 6-(3-chloro-2-fluorobenzyl)-1-((S) -l-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropyl)~7-methoxy-4-oxo-l, 4-dihydroquinoline)-3-carboxylic acid (hereinafter sometimes to be abbreviated as compound (10)) as one of the compounds particularly useful as an anti-HIV agent, and a production method thereof.<br>
Specifically, Example 4-32 of patent reference 1 describes the following production example.<br>
In addition, production of 2,4-difluoro-5-iodobenzoic acid, which is a starting material, is disclosed in patent reference 1, Example 4-33, step 1. [0028]<br><br><br>
[0029]<br>
therein NIS is N-iodosuccinimide, catalyst shows a catalyst, and Dther symbols are as defined in patent reference 1.<br>
This production method is also described in patent ceference 2, page 112, Reference Example 9.<br>

[0030]<br><br>
[0031]<br>
Moreover, patent reference 1, page 81, Reference Example 1, and patent reference 2, page 80 or Reference Example 1 disclose that 2,3-dichlorobenzylzinc chloride which is an analog of 3-chloro-2-fluorobenzylzinc bromide produced in the above-mentioned step 6 can be produced in the same manner from 2,3-dichlorobenzyl chloride.       - ■■ [0032]<br><br>
[0033]<br>
Patent reference 3 discloses a production method of compound (10).<br>
Specifically, patent reference 3, Example 2-2, page 28 describes the following production example. [0034]<br><br><br>
[0035]<br>
wherein DBU is 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undecene, catalyst shows a catalyst, and other symbols are as defined in patent reference 3.<br>
[0036]<br>
Patent reference 1, patent reference 2 and patent reference 3 disclose production methods of compound (10).  The references have the following aspects.<br>
In the final step (alkoxylation, particularly methcxyiation), a dimer is by-produced depending on the base to be used.  Thus, in this event, a removal step of the by-produced dimmer is further necessary, which decreases the yield greatly.<br><br>
■	itfhen sodium fluoride by-produced in the final step<br>
faikoxylation, particularly methoxylation) is acidified in the<br>
treatment step, hydrofluoric acid is produced, which corrodes<br>
the production facility.  Thus, a removal operation of sodium<br>
fluoride is essential and the operation is complicated.<br>
■	There is a concern about an unfavorable influence of<br>
hydrofluoric acid produced in the ring-closing step on the<br>
production facility, and therefore, the method is not of a level<br>
satisfactory as an industrial production method.<br>
■	Removal of the product by-produced in a reaction to insert<br>
compound [lib] is complicated (since alkyl zinc derivative is<br>
used with a palladium catalyst, an operation to remove zinc salt<br>
and palladium salt as impurities is necessary and the operation<br>
is complicated).<br>
■	Plural operations are necessary to protect hydroxyl group with<br>
methyl chloroformate in a preliminary step of the reaction to<br>
insert compound [lib], and to deprotect the group in a later<br>
step, and the operation is complicated.<br>
■	A step using 3-chioro-2-fluorobenzyl bromide for the<br>
production of compound [lib] is not benefical for industrial<br>
production since the compound shows high tearing property.<br>
The above-mentioned production methods including these steps are associated with many aspects to be improved for industrial production, and the development of a more superior production method of compound (10) is desired.<br>
[0037]<br>
In addition, while non-patent reference 1 describes the following 4-oxoquinoline compound and the like, the compounds (8) and (9) of the present invention, which are explained in detail in the following, are not described.<br><br><br>
[0039]<br>
In addition, while Example 1 (lc) of patent reference 4 describes the following acrylic acid ester and the like, the compounds (6) [ (6-A) and (6-B)}, and ("7-1) of the present invention, which are explained in detail in the following, are not described. [0040]<br><br>
[0041]<br>
Moreover, patent reference 5 describes a production example of 4-oxoquinoline skeleton from the following acrylic acid ester and the like, in a ring-closing reaction during formation of 4-oxoquinoline skeleton.  However, a production method from compound (7-1) to compound (8) and a production method from compound (6-B) to compound (7-2) like those in the present invention explained in detail in the following are not described.

Effect of the Invention [0620]<br>
The present invention can provide novel compounds (6), (7-1), (7-2) and (8) useful as synthetic intermediates for anti-HIV agents (compounds) having an integrase inhibitory activity, production methods of the synthetic intermediates, and production methods of anti-KIV agents (compounds) (e.g., compound (10) and the like) using the synthetic intermediates. [0621]<br>
The present invention can provide an industrially highly valuable production method of an anti-HIV agent (compound).  For example, using an intermediate compound having a methoxy group in advance as a synthetic intermediate for the production of compound (10), which is an anti-HIV agent (compound), a decrease in the yield due to the final step (alkoxylation, particularly methoxylation) in the prior art and by-production of sodium fluoride can be avoided.  Using compound (6-A) and/or compound (7-1) in a ring closure step, moreover, the generation of hydrogen fluoride (HF) that causes corrosion of the production<br><br>
facility can be avoided, whereby problems in the prior art (avoidance of decreased yield, corrosion of production facility, etc.) can be overcome.<br>
[06223<br>
Further, the present invention can also provide production methods of the above-mentioned synthetic intermediates.<br>
Since the above-mentioned synthetic intermediates can overcome the above-mentioned problems in the prior art during the production of an anti-HIV agent (compound), a production method of the synthetic intermediate also has a high value for industrial application and is significant.<br>
Of the synthetic intermediates, compound (7-2) and compound (8) are stable by themselves, and can tolerate severe conditions and/or long-term preservation.  Furthermore, since the quality thereof influences the progress of a palladium catalyst reaction in the next step, and is also directly related to the quality of anti-HIV agents (compounds) (e.g., compound (10) and the like), they are extremely important intermediate compounds. [0623]<br>
Moreover, highly distributable compound (1) is used as a starting material in the present invention.  Thus, the production method of the present invention can produce an anti-HIV agent (compound) more economically, since stability of supply of the starting material can be improved.<br>
