				<td>Apparatus at a spinning room machine, especially a spinning<br>
preparation machine, for example a carding machine or draw<br>
frame, for visual signal display<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus at a spinning room<br>
machine, especially a spinning preparation machine, for<br>
example a carding machine or draw frame, for visual signal<br>
display, wherein at least two light sources in the form of<br>
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are provided, which are<br>
associated with one cover, the signal display - which is in<br>
communication with a control device - being capable of<br>
emitting signals of light of different colours.<br>
In practice, modern production machines or systems in a<br>
spinning room are capable of providing a user with a large<br>
amount of useful and in some cases absolutely necessary<br>
information. For a rapid overall view, signal pillars are<br>
often used, which consist of several signal generators of<br>
different colours arranged above one another. Depending on<br>
the particular application, up to five different signal<br>
generators can be present. A specific message is associated<br>
with each of the lamps or alternatively with combinations<br><br>
of more than one lamp. The messages may be, for example: red (continuous<br>
light), which indicates a machine malfunction; orange (flashing), which indicates<br>
can changing. For each individual signal generator, a transparent coloured cover<br>
is used together with white filament bulbs or LEDs. It is disadvantageous therein<br>
that, for each colour or colour combination, there is required a filament bulb, a<br>
cover, a bulb fitting etc., as a result of which the signal generators are relatively<br>
complicated and, in addition, expensive.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is therefore to provide an apparatus of the<br>
kind described at the beginning that avoids the mentioned disadvantages and,<br>
especially, that is of simple construction and allows a reduced outlay in terms of<br>
manufacture and installation.<br>
The problem is solved by the device according to the invention using only at<br>
least one transparent and colourless cover. Inside the cover there is used a<br>
combination of a plurality of coloured light-emitting diodes. The corresponding<br>
LEDs are triggered depending upon the signal that is to delivered in a particular<br>
case. By that means, using only one lighting means (a plurality of LEDs<br>
indifferent colours) and only one cover, it is possible, depending on the<br><br>
particular LEDs in the arrangement, to deliver a large<br>
number of different coloured signals.<br>
Claims 2 to 26 contain advantageous developments of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in greater<br>
detail with reference to exemplary embodiments shown in the<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. la shows, in a diagrammatic perspective<br>
view, the machine panelling of a draw<br>
frame with the apparatus according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Fig. 2 shows, in a diagrammatic perspective<br>
view, the machine panelling of a carding<br>
machine with the apparatus according to<br>
the invention;<br>
Figs. 3a, 3b are cross-sections through the signal<br>
generator according to the invention,<br>
emitting light of a first colour<br>
(Fig. 3a) and emitting light of a second<br>
colour (Fig. 3b);<br>
Fig. 4 shows a two-sided arrangement of light-<br>
emitting diodes;<br>
Fig. 5	shows the use of a reflective surface;<br>
and<br>
Fig. 6 shows the use of a conical reflecting<br>
mirror.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows machine panelling 1 for a draw frame 14<br>
(known per se) , for example a Trutzschler draw frame. The<br>
machine panelling 1 is a casing comprising walls, doors and<br>
flaps made from sheet metal, inside which the draw frame is<br>
located. In the region associated with the exit from the<br>
draw frame there is provided a holding device, for example<br>
a curved bar, tube 2 or the like, one end of which is<br>
fastened to the machine panelling 1 attached to the machine<br>
frame (not shown). Arranged in the region of the other end<br>
of the bar 2 is the visual signal generator 3 according to<br>
the invention. In addition, an operating and display<br>
device 4 is attached to the bar 2. Reference letter A<br>
denotes the work direction of the draw frame.<br>
Fig. 2 shows machine panelling 5 for a carding<br>
machine 15 (known per se), for example a Trutzschler<br>
carding machine. The machine panelling 5 is a casing<br>
comprising walls, doors and flaps made from sheet metal,<br>
inside which the carding machine is located. In the region<br>
associated with the exit from the carding machine there is<br>
a holding device, for example a bar, tube 2 or the like,<br>
one end of which is fastened to the machine panelling,<br>
which is mounted on the machine frame (not shown). Arranged<br>
in the region of the other end of the bar 2 is the visual<br>
signal generator 3 according to the invention. Reference<br>
letter B denotes the work direction of the carding machine.<br><br>
In accordance with Figs. 3a, 3b, a plurality of light-<br>
emitting diodes (LEDs) 7', 7' are connected to one another<br>
in succession, as a result of which a light source 7 is<br>
formed. The plurality of light-emitting diodes 7', 7' are<br>
arranged vertically above one another in the form of a<br>
circle (around a vertical axis) and form a visual signal<br>
generator. The signal generator 7 is fastened onto a<br>
mounting pedestal 8 and is surrounded by a transparent,<br>
colourless cover 9, for example of plastics material. The<br>
mounting pedestal 8 is in the form of an electric circuit<br>
board. The light-emitting diodes 7', 7' are operated by<br>
means of an electrical circuitry arrangement 10, which is<br>
integrated into the mounting pedestal 8 and so forms a<br>
circuit board. The circuitry arrangement 10 is in<br>
communication with an electrical control device 11, for<br>
example the machine's control system. In accordance with<br>
the invention, light of the desired colour 7a and/or 7b,<br>
depending on the control instruction, is emitted.<br>
In accordance with Figs. 3a, 3b, a transparent and<br>
colourless cover is used, inside which a combination of a<br>
plurality of coloured light-emitting diodes come into<br>
operation (Figs. 3a and 3b). Depending on the signal to be<br>
delivered in a particular case, the appropriate LEDs are<br>
triggered. For example:<br>
red LEDs correspond to machine malfunction<br>
green LEDs correspond to everything in order<br><br>
etc.<br>
Using only one lighting means (a plurality of LEDs in<br>
different colours) and only one cover, it is possible,<br>
depending on the particular LEDs in the arrangement, to<br>
deliver a large number of different coloured signals.<br>
Likewise, colour combinations can also be produced as a<br>
result of off-setting over time.<br>
Example for a combination of light-emitting diodes for<br>
red and green light:<br>
In this case, the diodes emit red and green light<br>
alternately. In order for the individual colours still to<br>
be perceived as such by the viewer, a change-over of<br>
approximately one-second is advantageous, which means that<br>
the signal generator shines red for about one second, then<br>
green for one second and then again red for one second<br>
etc.<br>
The signal generator can provide additional information<br>
by means of one or more colours emitting flashing light.<br>
Use of the invention results in the following<br>
advantages, amongst others:<br>
1.	A single signal generator.<br>
2.	Only one cover with one light unit is<br>
required.<br>
3.	The outlay for the entire device is<br>
substantially reduced.<br>
4.	As a result of the use of light-emitting<br><br>
diodes, the service Life of the light unit is<br>
almost infinitely long.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 4, the light-emitting diodes 7',<br>
7' are mounted on both sides of a circuit board 10.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 5, the circuit board 10 is so<br>
constructed that the intermediate spaces between the light-<br>
emitting diodes 7', 7' act as reflectors. For that<br>
purpose, the circuit boards are provided with a copper<br>
layer 12 over the entire surface on each side, in which<br>
layer the respective connections for the LEDs 7', 7' are<br>
integrated. If the rest of the copper layer is, for<br>
example, tin-coated, it acquires a silver-coloured, shiny<br>
and light-reflecting surface. Other reflective surface<br>
finishes, for example gilded finishes, are likewise<br>
possible.<br>
Simply by supplying a relatively high current to the<br>
LEDs a flash effect can be obtained so that the use of an<br>
additional flash lamp is no longer necessary. Illumination<br>
and flash are accordingly possible using one and the same<br>
lamp. As a result, the functionality of the signal<br>
generator 7 is additionally increased without major outlay.<br>
The LEDs are generally supplied with pulsed current.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 6, the light-emitting diodes 7',<br>
7' are mounted on the circuit board 10. Opposite the<br>
circuit board 10 and the light-emitting diodes 7', 7'<br>
there is provided - inside the cover 9 - a cone-shaped or<br><br>
truncated-cone-shaped mirror 13, the envelope surfaces of<br>
which are preferably at an angle of about 45°. Light is<br>
shone from the light-emitting diodes 7', 7' onto the<br>
mirror 13, is deflected through 90° by the mirror surface<br>
and is shone outwards through the cover 9.<br>
When one kind of light-emitting diode emits white light,<br>
at least one other kind emits a different colour, that is<br>
to say white is considered in this case to be a colour.<br>
