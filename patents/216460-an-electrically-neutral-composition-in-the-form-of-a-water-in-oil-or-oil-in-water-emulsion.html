				<td>ELECTROSTATIC AEROSOL COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to aerosol compositions and, in particular, compositions in which the droplets are imparted with an electrostatic charge on spraying from an aerosol; spray device and in which the electrostatic charge on the droplets is maximised through the inclusion in the compositions of certain selected components.<br>
Aerosol spray devices are a convenient form in which a variety of useful products, such as insecticides, air fresheners, antiperspirants, hair sprays, horticultural products, waxes and polishes, oven cleaners, starches and fabric finishes, shoe and leather care products, glass cleaners and various other household, institutional, professional or industrial products, can be dispensed.<br>
The utility of aerosol spray devices resides in the ability to readily deliver the composition contained within the device in the form of fine droplets to the target area, for example the spraying of an insecticide onto target insects.<br>
In WO 97/28883 there is described a method of precipitating airborne particles from air in a domestic environment containing such particles in which the air to be treated is sprayed with liquid droplets from an aerosol spray device with a unipolar charge being imparted to the droplets during the spraying of the liquid droplets by the aerosol spray device, the unipolar charge being at a level such that the droplets have a charge to mass ratio of at least + /- 1 X 10"^ C/kg.<br>
In WO 99/01227 there is described a method of killing flying insects by spraying into the air in which the insects are flying liquid droplets of an<br><br>
insecticidal composition, a unipolar charge being " imparted to the liquid droplets by double layer charging and charge separation during spraying, the unipolar charge being at a level such that the said liquid droplets have a charge to mass ratio of at least +/- 1 X  10-4 c/kg.  An apparatus for imparting the unipolar charge of this magnitude to a liquid composition is also described.<br>
We have now found that by careful selection of the components which are to be contained within, a liquid composition for application by aerosol spraying, it is possible to charge the liquid dropleti during the spraying operation without requiring any special features of the construction of the aerosol spraying head.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect the present invention provides an electrically neutral composition in the form of a water-in-oil or an oil-in-water emulsion, ii which droplets of the emulsion on discharge from an aerosol spray device are imparted with a unipolar electrostatic charge, which composition comprises:<br>
(a)	at least one propellent in an amount of fro: 2 to 80% w/w;<br>
(b)	at least one non-ionic surfactant in an amount of from 0.01 to 10% w/w;<br>
(c)	optionally one or more oils or solvents, preferably aliphatic, linearly conjugated or aromatic within the oil phase in an amount of up to 80% w/w, preferably up to 40% w/w;<br>
(d)	at least one polar or ionic or aromatic or conjugated compound in an amount of from 0.01 to 80% w/w based on the non-ionic surfactant, but which is such that the theoretical conductivity of the emulsion is less than the bulk conductivity of the emulsion; and<br><br>
(e)     water.<br>
in  a   second  aspect   the present   invention provides<br>
a method of enhancing the unipolar charge which is<br>
imparted  to  droplets  of  an  emulsion  on  discharge   from<br>
an  aerosol   spray device   in which  the  droplets  are<br>
formed from an oil-in-water ,or a water-in-oil emulsion<br>
composition which comprises:   "	,<br>
(a)	at  least  one  propellent   in  an  amount  of   from<br>
2   to   8 0%  w/w;<br>
(b)	at least one non-ionic surfactant in an<br>
amount of from 0.01 to 10% w/w;<br>
(c)	, optionally one or more oils or solvents,<br>
preferably aliphatic, linearly conjugated or aromatic,<br>
within the oil phase in an amount of up to 80% w/w.<br>
preferably up to 40% w/w;<br>
(d)	at least one polar or ionic or aromatic or linearly conjugated compound in an amount of from 0.1 to 80% w/w based on the non-ionic surfactant, but which is such that the theoretical conductivity of the emulsion is less than the bulk conductivity of the emulsion; and<br>
(e)	water.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention provides the use of a non-ionic surfactant and at least one<br>
polar or ionic or<br>
aromatic or conjugated compound in an amount of from 0.01 to 80% w/w based on the non-ionic surfactant to enhance the electrostatic charge imparted to droplets of a composition in the form of a water-in-oil or an oil-in-water emulsion on discharge from an aerosol spray device, which composition includes:<br>
(a)	at least one propellant in an amount of from<br>
2 to 80% w/w;<br>
(b)	optionally one or more oils or solvents,<br>
preferably aliphatic, linearly conjugated or aromatic.<br><br>
within  the oil phase in an amount of up to 80% w/w,   preferably up to 40% w/w;  and<br>
(c)     water;<br>
and the amount of  the polar or ionic or aromatic or conjugated compound being such that the  theoretical conductivity of the emulsion is lees than the bulk conductivity of the emulsion.<br>
The liquid droplets preferably have a charge to mass  ratio of at least  +/-  1 x 10-4 C/kg,   more preferably at least +/-  2 x 10"* C/kg.     The higher the charge  to mass ratio of the liquid droplets,   the more effective the liquid droplets will be for their intended use,   such as precipitating airborne particles<br><br>
and targeting insects. This charge level is considerably higher than the charge level which is achieved when spraying conventional liquid formulations from conventional aerosol spray device where charge levels of the order of+/4 x 10-5 to +/-i x 10-8 c/kg are obtained.<br>
In the formulations of the present invention it is the combination of components (b) and (d) of the emulsion which improves the electron transfer through the emulsion with the charge being transferred from droplet to droplet through the emulsion at the interface between the disperse phase and the continuous phase.<br>
The various components (a) to (e) of the compositions of the present invention are discussed in turn below:<br>
At least 90% by volume of the droplets of the disperse phase within the emulsion have an average diameter of less than 60 fim. Preferably at least 90% by volume of the droplets of the disperse phase within the emulsion have an average diameter in the range of from 20 to 40 ^m.<br>
Propellants One or more propellants are used in the composition of the invention in a total amount of from 2 to 80% w/w. Amongst the propellants that may be used are hydrocarbons and compressed gas, of which hydrocarbons are preferred. Hydrocarbon propellants which may be used are acetylene, methane,     ethane,    ethylene,   propane,   n-butane, n-butene,    isobutene,<br><br>
isobutene, pentane, pentene, isopentane and isopentene. Mixtures of these propellants may also be used. Commercially available propellants typically contain a umber of hydrocarbon gases. For example, odorised commercial butane, contains predominantly n-butane and some iso-butane together with small amounts of propane, propene, pentane and butene.<br>
Preferred   hydrocarbon   propellants   include   propane,   n-butane, isobutene, pentane and isopentane,<br><br>
whilst  the most preferred are propane,   iso-butane  and n-butaile.<br>
Particularly preferred hydrocarbon propellants are  mixtures  of propane,   n-butane  and  iso-butane.<br>
Whilst broadly the concentration of hydrocarbon propellant will be  from 2 - tq  80% w/w,   generally the concenttation will be  from 10"to  60% w/w,   preferably 25 to   60% w/w and most preferably about  40% w/w.<br>
■When  compressed gases   are  used as   a  propellant these  will generally be carbon dioxide,   nitrogen or air.      Usually,   they will be used  at  a  concentration  of 2  to 20% w/w,   preferably about 5% w/w.<br>
Non-ionic Surfactanta<br>
Non-ionic   surfactants   for use  in  the  present alkoxylated amines;   alkoxylated  acids;   amine   oxides; ethoxylated/proproxylated block  copolymers; alkoxylated alkanolamides;   and alkoxylated alkyl phenols.<br>

Further examples  are the polyethylene glycol  oleates,   such   as   PEG-4   oleate,   PEG-8   oleate   and PEG-12  oleate.<br>
In  some  instances,   the   non-ionic   surfactant  may itself be  combined  with  component    (d) .      For  example, when  the  non-ionic   surfactant,is   polyglycerol   oleate.<br><br>
the  surfactant may contain  small quantities  of  sodium or  potassium oleates as  impurities  as  a by-product  of manufacture.   For example  is  an  amount  of  from  0.01   to 1%  by  weight.     Greater quantities  of such ionic compounds are generally not desirable and may result in the   compositions not  fulfilling the conductivity requirements of the compositions of the invention.,<br>
The   concentration  of  the  non-ionic  surfactant   is from   0.01  to  10% w/w,   preferably  O.Ol  to   1%  w/w.<br>

Insacticidal Composition<br>
In one preferred agent of the present invention the compositions are insecticidal compositions which contain from 0.001 to 5% w/w of an insecticidal compound. A wide range of active ingredients may be used of which pyrethroids, particularly synthetic pyrethroids, chlorpyrifos, propoxur and diazinon are preferred.<br>
When synthetic pyrethroids such as lamnbda cyhalothrin and bioresmethrin are used, generally they will be incorporated in concentrations of about 0.02% w/w or above.<br>
Other synthetic pyrethroids such as cypermethrin, tetramethrin, permethrin and bioallethrin, will usually be incorporated to give a concentration of about 0.2%-0,S% w/w, or above.<br><br>
Chloropyrifos, propoxur and diazinion will generally be incorporated to give concentration in the range of 0.5-0.9% w/w.<br>
Preferably, insecticidal compositions of the invention will include an insecticide which functions primarily to knock down an insect, ■ together with a second insecticide which functions primarily as a "kill agent.  An example of such a combination is the use of permethrin as a kill agent in a combination with tetramethrin as a knock down agent.<br>
Optional Ingredients<br>
Various optional ingredients may be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention.  For example, in order to maximise the effectiveness of the insecticidal activity of the compositions of the invention, synergists such as N-octylbicycloheptene dicarboximide and piperonyl butoxide may be included at a concentration of from 0.5 to 1.5% w/w, most preferably about 1.0% w/w, for use in conjunction with pyrethroid insecticides.<br>

One or more fragrance components may also be included, according to the particular consumer requirements.  It will be understood that certain fragrance components are components which may comprise component (d) of the compositions of the present ihvention and in this instance, such a component is not an optional ingredient.<br><br>
Lewia Acid and Lowis Base Characteriatics<br>
in relation to the fourth embodiment of the inverition an aerosol spray device and the electrically neutral composition contained therein have certain Lewis acid and Lewis base characteristics which assist in imparting a unipolar charge to the liquid.<br>
When two substances are brought together and then separated, an electridal charge is transferred from one to .the" other.  This can occur for solid-solid separations, for solid-liquid separations and for liquid-liquid separations.  When one of the components becomes airborne, the electrical charge can remain on the substance for a significant length of time as there ia no plaee to gxpund-.the ChaKg«.  The ab4.Xi&gt;£y of suJ?6t«ni©e^^a^rainB*<m chw be to th an></m>
(Y-)vaiues,fo« the.j»«hBtaBee:i^ Ai4^uJaa£«aswasJfeCse&gt;" characteristic values and these can be calculatft"*^"^ indirectly from their component surface energies.<br><br>
These surface energies when combined with a London-van der Waals component (γlm) form what is known as the surface tension. , This is easiest to measure at the interface between a drop of liquid on a solid substrate.<br>
This equation used for; these calculations comes fromithe approach used by Good and van Oss:<br>
{1 +■ Cos e}YL, = 2[M:Y»""V") + V(VS*7L") + V(vs*YL~)] Where 6 is the contact angle that a drop of liquid makes with the surface.<br>
Ys is the energy component for the solid. YL is the energy component for the liquid. Y""" Respresents the London-van der Waals component. Y* is the Lewis acid component (electron acceptor) .<br>
Y" is the Lewis base component (electron donor) . Using three or more test liquids whose characteristics are known, it is possible to solve this equation for the three unknowns, Y*"** VS* and YS~. By using test solids whose characteristics are known, it is also possible to solve this equation to find the three unknown liquid surface energies.  Thus it is possible to characterise a series of solids and liquids to form a series of Y* an
Surface	" (mJ m"^)<br><br><br>
Liquids also have a value of y   and y*  that can be measured.  When liquids contact a solid of known y" and Y* on^-aerosol spraying^, and the v" of the liquid is gr»«"fceap:;thai&gt;r o»^ le«^s^lw!wi.&gt;thiip*. o4vtha-,s«ii#»i)y,.., 2 mJ^nTl/ prefeisebly-by^^-mJ^iiin"^" moftfc, prje^8»#bly 15 m^B^/ or .a V 94^fMt****^tb»*w•voxsaeaJJ^lSBWtf;l^i8^ solid by 0.5 mJ iti"^ prefisrably 1 mJ icr^,     utog^p-^ preferably 2 mJ iti"^, the liquid has a tendency to charge to +/- 1 x 10"* C/kg.  A common material from which inserts for aerosol actuators are made is Acetal 900P NC-10, which has a y"  of 15 mJ m"^.<br>
Aeroaol Spr«y D»v±amm<br>
The compositions of the present invention, when sprayed through conventional aerosol spray heads, form into droplets which are imparted with a unipolar charge of at least +/- 1 x 10"* C/kg.<br>
It is possible to impart^ even higher charges to the liquid droplets by choosing aspects of the aerosol device including the material, shape and dimensions of the actuator, the actuator insert, the valve and the dip tube and the characteristics of the liquid which is to be sprayed, so that the required level of charge<br><br>
is  generated as the liquid is dispersed as droplets. A number of characteristics of the aerosol  system increase double layer charging and charge exchange between the liquid formulation and the surface  of  the aerosol  system.     Such increases are brought about by factors which may increase the turbulence of the  flow through the system,   and increase the frequency and" velocity of  contact between the  liquid and  the internal surface of the  container and valve and actuator system.<br>
By way of example,   characteristics of the actuator can be optimised to increase the  charge levels  on the liquid sprayed from the container.     A smaller orifice in the actuator insert,   of a size of 0.45mm or less,   increases  the charge levels  of the liquid sprayed through the actuator.     The  choice  of material  for  the  actuator  can  also  increase  the  charge levels  on  the  liquid  sprayed  from the  device with materials  such as nylon,   polyester,   acetal,   PVC and polypropylene tending to increase the charge levels. The geometry of the orifice in  the insert  can be optimised to increase  the charge  levels  on the  liquid as  it is sprayed through the actuator.     Inserts which promote the mechanical break-up of the liquid give better charging.<br>
The actuator insert  of the  spray device may be formed  from a  conducting,   insulating,   semi-conducting or static-dissipative material.<br>
The characteristics  of the dip  tube  can be optimised  to  increase  charge  levels   in   the  liquid sprayed from the  container.     A narrow dip tube,   of  for example about  1.27 mm internal  diameter,   increases  the charge levels  on the  liquid,   and the  dip tube material can  also be  changed  to   increase  charge.<br><br>
Valve   characteristics can be selected which increase  the charge to mass ratio of the  liquid product   as   it  is  sprayed from the  container.     A small tailpiece  orifice in the housing,   of about  0.65 mm, increases  the charge to mass ratio during spraying.    A reduced number of holes in the stem,   for example 2 x 0.50mm,   also increases the charge during  spray.     The   , presence of, a, Vapour phase tap helps to maximise the charge  levels,   a  larger orifice vapour phase  tap of, for exan^le,   about  0.50 mm to  1.0 mm generally giving higher charge levels.<br>
The  liquid droplets  sprayed from the  aerosol spray device  h^ill  generally have diameters  in  the range  of  from 5  to  100 micrometres,   with  a peak of droplets o^wh^uit- 4%ja4e«ometres.<br>

Prepar»ti.oD<br>
The coit^ositions of the present invention may be prepared by standard technique^ which are well   known in the art.     For exait^le,   con^onents   (b)   to   (d)   may be mixed together to form the solvent phase.     This   solvent phase  is then mixed with water to produce an emulsified concentrate which is then  filled into cans  and blended with the propellant.     Alternatively,   the  concentrate  and the propellant may be  filled into the  cans   simultaneously. ConduetivitY<br>
The theoretical  conductivity of  an  emulsion,   o,   can be calculated from measurements  of  the  actual  conductivity of the external  phase and the  internal phase,   according to  the following equation:<br>
a «= ac(l  + 3(p{ap - ad / (Op + 2oc))<br>
where    c =     theoretical conductivity of the emulsion<br><br>
Oc    measured conductivity of  the<br>
separated external phase Op    measured conductivity of  the<br>
separated  Internal phase     volume  fraction of the  internal phase. the biilk conductivity can be cletermined by experimentation.   Component   (d)   of the compositions  of the present Invention  serves to enhance the  actual conductivity of the emulsion and thus the bulk conductivity of the emulsion is higher than the theoretical  conductivity calculated according  to the above  formula.     Preferably the difference between the theoretical  conductivity of the emulsion of  the emulsion is  at  least  +  0.5  iiS cm"^,   preferably at least «4  pS  cm"^,  more preferably at  least  +  6  jiS  cm~^. Component   (d)   in the compositions of the present invention thus improves  the  electron transfer  through the emulsion with the charge being transferred  from droplet to droplet  through the emulsion at  the interface between    the  disperse phase  and the continuous phase.<br>
The present invention will be further  described with reference to the  following non-limiting Examples.<br>
Method for pradicting" the thaoretiol conductivity of an emulsion  through  the measurwaent of  the conductivity of the individual phases:<br>
1.      Calibrate  the  conductivity cell  by measuring a  solution  of  known  conductivity.     The conductivity  cell  comprises  a pair  of platinum electrodes,   held  apart  and  attached to the  inside  of  a  glass  tube of approximately  1  on  internal  diameter.<br><br>
2-  Using the same cell, measure the<br>
conductivity of the bulk emulsion according to the invention, whilst ensuring that the emulsion is static and homogeneous prior to taking the measurement.<br>
3.	Determine whether the continuous phase of<br>
the emulsion is water or oil.<br>
4.	Separate the two phases of the emulsion by either gravimetric or centrifugal separation.  Isolate the phases and measure the conductivity of each phase in the, calibrated cell.<br>
5.	Use the equation given below to determine the theoretical conductivity of the bulk emulsion.<br>
