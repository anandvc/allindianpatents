				<td>This invention relates to a process for the treatment of the oily effluent produced by the petroleum upstream oil industries. Specifically, this invention relates to a process for the removal of the oil from the effluent received from the petroleum industries<br>
The fluid produced from oil reservoirs normally consists of oil, natural gas and saline water having both dissolved and suspended solids. Production of saline water proportionately increase with the increase of crude oil production and aging of oil field. This water may be in free state or emulsified state. Emulsified water is knocked out during the process of demulsification. Total water thus produced after series of treatment, before its disposal is termed as "EFFLUENT'. The effluent in the form of emulsion contains oil ranging from 30 to 1000 ppm and as such is not advisable to be disposed off on the surface or water bodies. To meet regional, national and international MINAS (minimal national acceptable standard) standards of less than 10 ppm of oil in effluent for its safe disposal.<br>
Various processes are as such known in the art for the treatment of the effluent produced by the oil industry. Some of the conventional processes are :<br>
i)	mechanical process which is a gravity separation<br>
ii)	chemical methods like coagulation and flocculation by using chemicals<br>
iii)	filteration by using sand and gravel beds<br>
iv)	air flotation by using air bubbles; and<br>
v)	biological treatment.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the conventional processes. One of the main disadvantage is that the conventional process are less effective and are very costly.<br>
Another disadvantages is that a series of expensive equipments are required to carry out the conventional processes for the treatment of the effluent.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that skilled workers are needed to operate the machines and to carry out the process of treatment of the effluent.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that costly chemicals are required in the treatment process that also causes secondary pollution to the environment.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to propose a novel process for the treatment of the effluent produced by the oil industries.<br>
i<br>
Another object is to propose a process wherein costly equipment are not required and it is very easy to carry out the process of treatment.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a novel process which does not causes any kind of pollution to the environment.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a novel process which is very easy to carry out the process of treatment of the effluent.<br>
According to this invention there is provided A process for the treatment of the oily effluent produced by the petroleum upstream oil industries comprising taking the oily effluent into a treatment chamber having electrodes as herein described characterised in that passing a regulated low direct current of density such as 200 amp/sq.mt through said effluent with the help of perforated electrodes made of Aluminum so as to produce the hydrogen gas bubbles of required size such as 50-100 micron and aluminum hydroxide for taking negatively charged oil droplets to the surface of the effluent, removing said layer of oil from the effluent by the conventional method and conveying the treated effluent to a settling tank to obtain the water without having impurity/pollutants present therein.<br>
In accordance with this invention the effluent produced in the oil industries is fed from the effluent tank to the treatment chamber. Atleast one pair of electrodes is provided inside the treatment chamber for facilitating passing of a regulated low direct current through the effluent. On passing the electric current through the effluent the process for electrolysis of water starts and the bubbles of hydrogen and aluminum hydroxide are produced at cathode and anode respectively. This helps the negatively charged oil droplets to move to the surface of the effluent along with the hydrogen bubbles and aluminum hydroxide. Thus, effluent is electrically destabilized and a layer of oil starts forming on the surface of the effluent which is subsequently removed from the surface of the affluent. The remaining effluent is conveyed to a settling tank wherein all the other impurities/pollutants are settled on the bottom of the tank and thus the treated water is ready to be discharged as per the required permissible limits.<br>
According to an option a plurality can be placed at the suitable locations in the treatment chamber for increasing the rate of electrolysis of the effluent. The electrodes used are perforated metallic electrodes preferably made of aluminum metal.<br>
