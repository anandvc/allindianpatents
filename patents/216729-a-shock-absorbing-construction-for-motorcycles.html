[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A SHOCK ABSORBING CONSTRUCTION FOR MOTORCYCLES"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1 1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the mariner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a shock absorbing construction for motorcycles.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001] [Technical Field to which the -Invention Belongs]<br>
The present invention relates to a shock absorbing construction for motorcycles in which a shock absorbing member projecting from the vehicle body is provided so that the shock absorbing member absorbs the impact by being collapsed. [0002] [Description of the Related Art]<br>
Fig. 7 is a side view of a shock absorbing construction for motorcycles in the related art.<br>
A shock absorbing member 105 is disposed upwardly of the front wheel 104-by mounting—a— fork 103—on  t-he—head pipe 102<br><br><br>
provided on a vehicle body frame 101 of a motorcycle 100, mounting a front wheel 104 on the fork 103, and mounting a deforming element (hereinafter referred to as "shock absorbing member") 105 at the front end of the vehicle body frame 101.<br>
The shock absorbing member 105 is manufactured by filling foam material 108 in a hollow portion 107 of a frame body 106.<br>
[0003]<br>
Fig. 8(a), (b) are an explanatory drawing showing the operation of the shock absorbing construction for motorcycles of the related art.<br>
In (a), when a motorcycle 100 (shown in Fig. 7) comes into collision with an obstruction, the tip portion 105a of the shock absorbing member 105 hits the obstruction, and an impact force Fl generated by collision acts on the tip portion 105a as shown by the arrow.<br>
[0004]<br>
In (b), when an impact force Fl acts on the tip portion 108a of the foam material 108, the tip portion 108a will be collapsed. Accordingly, by the tip portion 105a of the shock absorbing material 105 being collapsed as much as the amount of collapse LI, an impact force Fl is absorbed to protect the occupant.<br>
[0005] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Incidentally, when the tip potion 108a of the foam<br>
3<br><br>
material 108 is collapsed, the space in the foam material 108 is decreased, and thus it resists being collapsed. Therefore, when the foaming space is too small, it is difficult to ensure the sufficient amount of collapse of the shock absorbing member 105, and thus an impact force cannot be absorbed sufficiently.<br>
In order to absorb an impact force sufficiently, it is conceivable to increase the foaming space in the foam material 108 so that the amount of collapse of the foam material 108 is also increased.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, when the forming space in the foam material 108 is too much, the foam material 108 can be collapsed easily. Therefore, in order to absorb an impact force by means of the foam material 108 with a large amount of foaming space, it is required to increase the size of the foam material 108 to ensure the increased amount of collapse of the foam material 108. As a consequent, the dimensional standard of the shock absorbing member increases too much and thus it is difficult to put it into practical use.<br>
[0007]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a shock absorbing construction for motorcycles that has a dimensional standard suitable for practical use and can absorb the impact force sufficiently.<br>
[0008]<br><br><br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the object described above, the invention according to Claim 1 is a shock absorbing construction for motorcycles including a shock absorbing member projecting from the vehicle body, and allowing the shock absorbing member to absorb an impact force by being collapsed, characterized in that the shock absorbing member comprises a plurality of cavities and a reinforcing rib for dividing the adjacent cavities, and all or some of these reinforcing ribs are formed with a thinner portion.<br>
[J0009]<br>
The shock absorbing member comprises a plurality of cavities and a reinforcing rib for dividing the adjacent cavities, and all or some of these reinforcing ribs are formed with a thinner portion. By forming a thinner portion on all or some of the reinforcing ribs , the strength of the reinforcing ribs can be controlled. Therefore, the strength of the shock absorbing member can be adequately adjusted for the impact force.<br>
■[0010]<br>
In addition, providing a plurality of cavities helps to accommodate the reinforcing ribs in these cavities when the shock absorbing member is collapsed. Therefore, the sufficient amount of collapse of the shock absorbing member is ensured.<br><br><br>

[Fig. 8]<br>
Fig. 8 is an explanatory drawing showing the operation<br>
of the shock absorbing construction for motorcycles of the<br>
related art.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle mainly comprising<br>
a shock absorbing construction according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The motorcycle 10 is a scooter type vehicle comprising a vehicle body frame 11, a"front fork 12 mounted on a head pipe 11a of the vehicle body frame 11, a front wheel 13 mounted on the front fork 12, a steering handle 14 connected to the front fork 12, a swing unit 15 (an engine 15a, a transmission mechanism 15b) mounted at the rear portion of the vehicle body frame 11, a rear wheel 16 mounted on the rear portion of the swing unit 15, a seat 17 disposed at the rear top of the vehicle body frame 11, a front cover 18a for covering the front portion of the head pipe 11a, a center cover 18b extending rearward from the front cover 18a for covering the center of the vehicle body frame 11, a side cover 18c extending rearward from the center cover 18b for covering the rear portion of the vehicle body frame 11, and a shock absorbing structure 20 according to the present invention provided on the front cover 18a.<br>
[0012]<br><br>
The shock absorbing construction 20 comprises a frame body 22<br>
of a shock absorbing member 21 mounted on the front cover 18a<br>
by means of, for example, tightening means (not shown), and<br>
a plurality of reinforcing ribs 30... provided in a space 25<br>
in the frame body 22,	,,<br>
The frame body 22 comprises " a ceiling-wall 23 bent generally at the center into an inverted v-shape, and a peripheral wall 24 provided around the periphery of the ceiling wall 23, and a rear portion 24d of the peripheral wall 24 is mounted to the front cover 18a.<br>
[0013]<br>
It is also applicable to mount the frame body 22 to the front cover 18a and to the vehicle body frame 11, whereby the shock absorbing member 21 can be mounted on the vehicle body more firmly.<br>
[0014]<br>
The shock absorbing member 21 is a resin member projecting frontward from the vehicle body, or from the front wheel 13, by the distance L2. In this arrangement, the shock absorbing member 21 can absorb the impact by being collapsed when the motorcycle 10 comes into collision with an obstruction by any chance.<br>
As described above, the occupant is protected form the impact by the shock absorbing member 21, which absorbs an impact by being collapsed.<br><br><br><br><br>
[0015]<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2-2 in Fig. 1.<br>
The peripheral wall 24 of the frame body 22 is a wall portion formed generally in U-shape in cross section, comprising a front wall 24a extending linearly in the direction of the width along the front end of the ceiling wall 23 (See also Fig. 1), a left side wall 24b extending rearward from the left end of the front wall 24a and being curved in part (front end portion) thereof, a right side wall 24c extending rearward from the right end of the front wall 24a and being curved in part (front end portion) thereof, and the rear wall 24d connecting the rear ends of the left and right side walls 24b and 24c and being curved corresponding to the configuration of the front cover 18a.<br>
Providing the peripheral wall 24 around the ceiling wall 23  in this way defines the space 25  in the frame body 22.<br>
[0016]<br>
The shock absorbing member 21 is a construction in which a plurality of reinforcing ribs 30. . . are provided in the space 25 of the above-described frame body 22, the reinforcing ribs 30.. . divide the interior of the frame body 22 into a plurality of cavities 32..., and some of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g out of these reinforcing ribs 30... are formed respectively with thinner portions 35a-35g.<br><br><br>
[0017]<br>
Arranging the plurality of reinforcing ribs 30 . . . so that the cavities 32...are formed into generally triangular shape as shown in Fig. 2 helps the frame body 22 to have a desired strength.<br>
The positions to arrange the reinforcing ribs 30.., are not limited to the positions shown in Fig. 2, and they may be changed arbitrary according to the strength required for the shock absorbing member 21.<br>
[0018]<br>
The thinner portions 35a-35g is formed, for example, by the steps of selecting suitable reinforcing ribs 30a-30g out of the reinforcing ribs 30... that are subjected to a compressive load, and then forming the thinner portion 35a-35g on  the selected reinforcing ribs 30a-3 0g  respectively.<br>
In other words, the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g are provided on the right side and the left side of the shock absorbing member 21 so as to be symmetric with respect to a axle 37, and the thinner portions 35a-35g are provided on the left and right reinforcing ribs 30a-30g.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the shock absorbing member 21, when an impact force F acts on the front wall 24a as shown by an outline arrow, a compressive force acts in the direction of the axis of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the right side, and a<br><br><br>
compressive force acts in the direction of the axis of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the left side.<br>
Since the construction of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the right side and of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the left side are the same, only the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the right side are described and the description of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the left side is omitted.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of the portion 3 in Fig. 2 showing a state in which the thinner portion 35a is formed at the center of the reinforcing rib 30a; the thinner portion 35b is formed at the rear end of the reinforcing rib 30b (or the portion to be joined to the reinforcing rib 30); the thinner portion 35c is formed at the front end of the reinforcing rib 30c (or the portion to be joined to the reinforcing rib 30), the thinner portion 3 5d is formed at the rear end of the reinforcing rib 3 0d (or the portion to be joined to the reinforcing rib 30); the thinner portion 35e is formed at the front end of the reinforcing rib 3 0e (or the portion to be joined to the reinforcing rib 30).<br>
[0021]<br>
When the impact force F acts on the front wall 24a (shown in Fig. 2) of the shock absorbing member 21, the compressive force acts on these reinforcing ribs 30a-30g in the axial direction as shown by the arrows. Therefore, by forming the<br><br><br>
thinner portions 35a-35g on the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g, the thinner portions 3 5a-35g may be broken or deformed effectively.<br>
[0022]<br>
The operation of the shock absorbing construction 20 according to the present invention as described above will now be described.<br>
Fig. 4(a),- (b) are explanatory drawings showing the first operation of the shock absorbing construction for motorcycles according to the present invention.<br>
In (a), the front end 24a of the shock absorbing member 21 comes into collision with an obstruction 40 during traveling of the motorcycle 10. As a consequent, an impact force F acts on the front end 24a of the shock absorbing member 21./<br>
[0023]<br>
In (b), an impact force Fl acts on the tip of the reinforcing rib 30a as shown by the arrow (1), and a compressive force acts on the reinforcing rib 30a as shown by the arrow (2). Then, a compressive force acts on the reinforcing rib 30b as shown by the arrow (3), and a compressive force acts on the reinforcing rib 30c as shown by the arrow (4). Concurrently, a compressive force acts on the reinforcing rib 30d as shown by the arrow (5), and a compressive force acts on the reinforcing rib 30e  as shown by the arrow (6).<br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 5 (a), (b) are explanatory drawings showing the<br><br><br>
second operation of the shock absorbing construction for motorcycles according to the present invention<br>
In (a), on the right side, the thinner portion 35a of the reinforcing rib 3 0a, the thinner portion 3 5b of the reinforcing rib 30b, the thinner portion 35c of the reinforcing rib 30c, the thinner portion 35d of the reinforcing rib 30d, the thinner portion 35e of the reinforcing rib 30e, the thinner portion 35f of the reinforcing rib 30f, and the thinner portion 35g of the reinforcing rib 30g are broken.<br>
Concurrently, the respective thinner portions 35a-35g of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g on the left side are also broken as in the case of the right side.<br>
[0025] Breakage of the respective thinner portions 35a-35g removes the support by the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g. Therefore, the load can be concentrated on other reinforcing ribs 30..., and thus other reinforcing ribs 30. . . may be collapsed to the state shown in the figure.<br>
Since the thinner portions 35a-35g are provided generally over the whole area of a central portion 26 of the shock absorbing member 21, the whole area of the central portion 26 of the shock absorbing member 21 can be collapsed effectively, thereby ensuring a large amount of collapse L2 of the shock absorbing member 21.<br>
[0026]<br><br><br>
In (b), the increased amount of collapse L2 (shown in (a)) of the shock absorbing member 21 contributes to absorb an impact force F sufficiently when the front end 24a of the shock absorbing member 21 comes into collision with the obstruction 40, and thus a occupant 42 may be protected from the impact force F.<br>
[0027]<br>
As described above, the shock absorbing member 21 comprises the plurality of cavities 32... , and the reinforcing ribs 30...for dividing the adjacent cavities 32, 32, and the thinner portions 35a-35g are formed on some of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g out of these reinforcing ribs 30....<br>
[0028] The thinner portions 35a-35g formed on the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g can adjust the strength of the reinforcing ribs 30a-30g. Therefore, the strength of the shock absorbing member 21, or the extent of collapse can be suitably adjusted according to the impact force.<br>
In addition, provision of the plurality of cavities 32...contributes to ensure sufficient amount of collapse L2 of the shock absorbing member 21.<br>
Since the extent of collapse of the shock absorbing member 21 can be adjusted to ensure the amount of collapse L2 as is described thus far, the shock absorbing member 21 can be formed in dimensions that are suitable for practical use,<br><br><br>
and  simultaneously,  the  impact  force  can be  absorbed sufficiently.<br>
[0029]<br>
Fig. 6 is a graph showing a relation between an impact force and the amount of collapse in the shock absorbing construction according to the present invention.<br>
The graph representing the case where a shock absorbing member according to the related art is collapsed in a dashed line is shown as a "comparative example", and the graph representing the case where a shock absorbing member according to the present invention is collapsed in a solid line is shown as an "embodiment". The vertical axis represents an impact force (F), and the lateral axis represents the amount of collapse (L) of the shock absorbing member.<br>
[0030]<br>
The comparative example shows that the amount of collapse of the shock absorbing member is as small as Ll, and the graph in a dashed line represents a concave curve. Therefore, the amount of impact energy that can be absorbed is small in the area El surrounded by 0-F1-L1, where it is difficult to protect the occupant sufficiently from the impact force.<br>
The reason why the graph in a dashed line represents a concave curve here is that the shock absorbing member ((foam material) in the comparative example can be collapsed by a relatively small impact force.<br><br><br>
[0031]<br>
In the embodiment, the amount of collapse of the shock absorbing member is as large as L2, and the graph in a solid line represents a convex curve. Therefore, the amount of impact energy that can be absorbed is large in the area E2 surrounded by 0-F2-L2, where the occupants can be protected sufficiently from the impact force.<br>
The reason why the graph in a solid line represents a convex curve here is that the shock absorbing member in the embodiment is collapsed by a suitable impact force.<br>
[0032]<br>
In the embodiment described above, the case where some of the reinforcing ribs 30ct-30g out of the reinforcing ribs 30... are formed with thinner portions 35a-35g respectively is described. However, it is not limited thereto, and is also applicable to form a thinner portion for all the reinforcing ribs 30.... The locations for forming the thinner portions 35a-35g may be determined as appropriate.<br>
[0033]<br>
Though an example in which the shock absorbing member 21 is formed of resin is described in the embodiment described above, it is also possible to form it of other materials, such as aluminum alloy, steel, or the like.<br>
In the embodiment described above, an example in which the shock absorbing member 21 is attached at the front end of<br><br><br>
the vehicle body is shown. However, the same effect can be achieved even when the shock absorbing member 21 is mounted at the rear end or at the left and right sides of the vehicle body.<br>
[0034] [Advantages of the Invention]<br>
The present invention in the arrangement described above provides the following advantages.<br>
The shock absorbing member according to Claim 1 is provided with a plurality of cavities and reinforcing ribs for dividing the adjacent cavities, and all or some of the reinforcing ribs are formed with thinner portions.<br>
Provision of thinner portions for all or some of the reinforcing ribs enables to adjust the strength of the reinforcing rib. Therefore, the strength of the shock absorbing member can be suitably adjusted according to the impact force.<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition, provision of a plurality of cavities enables to accommodate the reinforcing ribs in these cavities when the shock absorbing member is collapsed. Therefore, the sufficient amount of collapse of the shock absorbing member is ensured.<br>
As is described thus far, since the extent of collapse of the shock absorbing member can be adjusted to establish the<br><br><br>
amount of collapse, the dimensions of the shock absorbing member can be selected to be suitable for practical use, and simultaneously, an impact force can be absorbed sufficiently.<br>
