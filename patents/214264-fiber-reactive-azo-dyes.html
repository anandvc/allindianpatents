				<td>The invention relates to the field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
DE-A-3516667 describes green to olive metal complex dyes for use as reactive dyes<br>
for cotton, wool or nylon. However, they have certain application defects, for example<br>
an excessive dependence of the color yield on varying parameters in the dyeing<br>
process, or an inadequate or unlevel build-up on cotton, good build-up resulting from<br>
the ability of a dye to provide a stronger dyeing when used in a higher dye<br>
concentration in the dyebath. Moreover, these dyes exhibit unsatisfactory fixation,<br>
yields, i.e., the portion of dye permanently fixed on the material to be dyed is too low,<br>
especially at low temperatures, and also unsatisfactory washfastnesses.<br>
However, it is important, for ecological and economic reasons, to provide dyes<br>
having particularly high fixation yields in order that the portion of unfixed dye in the<br>
dyehouse effluent may be minimized. Moreover, dyes should always provide<br>
uniformly strong dyeings, ideally regardless of changing dyeing parameters, for<br>
example the dyeing temperature in the dyeing process. Furthermore, washfastness<br>
requirements are more stringent these days.<br>
The present invention now provides dyes of the general formula (1) which<br>
surprisingly afford distinctly superior washfastnesses. Moreover, these dyes have<br>
higher fixation yields and a distinctly lower parameter dependence in dyeing. They<br>
are therefore also more compatible with other dyes which fix at distinctly lower<br>
temperatures.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dyes of the general formula (1):<br><br><br>
where<br>
M is hydrogen, alkali, ammonium or the. equivalent of an alkaline earth metal ion,<br>
X is halogen, for example fluorine or chlorine, C1-C4 alkoxy, for example<br>
methoxy or ethoxy, amino, a 5- or 6-membered nitrogen heterocycle of the<br>
t<br>
formula (a), (b) (c) or (d)<br><br>
where when X is a group of the formula (a)<br>
A- is fluoride, chloride or the equivalent of a sulfate ion and<br>
n is 1 or 2;<br>
or X is unsubstituted or sulfo- or hydroxyl-mono- or -disubstituted anilino, an<br>
alkylamino or N,N-dialkylamino with C1-C4-alkyl, for example<br>
N,N-dimethylamino, or N,N-diethylamino, preferably chloro or fluoro<br>
R1 is C1-C6 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl,<br>
sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy,<br><br>
propyloxy, butyloxy, chlorine, C1-C4-alkylcarbonylamino, for example<br>
methylcarbonylamino, ethylcarbonylamino, propylcarbonylamino,<br>
butylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, for example phenylcarbonylamino,<br>
and preferably is methoxy;<br>
R2 has any meaning of R1 and is preferably methoxy or else R1 and R2 combine<br>
to form a ring of the formula (f) or (g):<br><br>
R3 is C1-C6-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl,<br>
sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl or hydrogen and is preferably hydrogen<br>
Q is a grouping of the formula (e)<br><br>
where<br>
R4 has any meaning of R3 or is phenyl which may be substituted by chlorine or<br>
sulfo and is preferably methyl or hydrogen;<br>
W is a CnH2n-alkylene group where n is 2 to 6, which may be interrupted by 1 or 2<br>
oxygen atoms or an NR5 group, and is preferably ethylene, propylene,<br>
3-oxapentyl,<br>
R5 has any meaning of R3 or is phenyl, preferably methyl,<br>
or else when X is fluorine or chlorine, Q can be a group of the formula (a), (b),<br>
(c) or (d), preferably Q is a radical of the formula (b) or (a), particularly<br>
preferably Q is a grouping of the formula (e);<br>
Y is vinyl or is a grouping of the formula CH2CH2Z wherein<br>
Z is an alkali-eliminable group, for example chloro, acetyl, phosphato,<br><br>
quaternary nitrogen group and is particularly preferably sulfato.<br>
The dyes of the invention can be present as a preparation in solid or in liquid<br>
(dissolved) form. In solid form, they generally include the electrolyte salts customary<br>
for water-soluble and especially for fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride,<br>
potassium chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further include the auxiliaries<br>
customary in commercial dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in<br>
aqueous solution between 3 and 7, such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, sodium tricitrate and disodium hydrogen-<br>
phosphate, or small amounts of siccatives; if they are present in a liquid, aqueous<br>
solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type customary in print pastes),<br>
they may also include substances which ensure a long life for these preparations, for<br>
example mold preventatives.<br>
In general, the dyes of the invention are present as dye powders containing 10 to<br>
80% by weight, based on the dye powder or the preparation, of an electrolyte salt<br>
which is also referred to as a standardizing agent. These dye powders may<br>
additionally include the aforementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to<br>
10% by weight, based on the dye powder. If the dyes of the invention are present in<br>
aqueous solution, the total dye content of these aqueous solutions will be up to<br>
about 50% by weight, for example between 5 and 50% by weight, and the electrolyte<br>
salt content of these aqueous solutions will preferably be below 10% by weight,<br>
based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions (liquid preparations) may<br>
include the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is generally up to<br>
10% by weight, preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
The dyes of the invention can be prepared in a conventional manner, for example by<br>
means of the customary diazotization, coupling and coppering reactions and<br>
conversion reactions with a trihalotriazine component followed by an introduction of<br>
Q by substitution of halogen, where Q is as defined above, using appropriate<br>
mixtures of such components in a manner familiar to one skilled in the art and using<br>
the required proportions.<br>
A useful process comprises for example starting from a compound of the<br><br>
formula (1a) by diazotization with sodium nitrite in aqueous hydrochloric acid and<br>
subsequent coupling onto a compound of the formula (1 b) to prepare a dye of the<br>
formula 1 (c)<br><br>
and further diazotization with sodium nitrite in a hydrochloric acid medium and<br>
coupling of the resultant compound<br><br>
onto an R3-N-substituted 5-hydroxy-1,7-disulfo-2-naphthylamine to form a compound<br>
of the formula (1d)<br><br><br>
which is converted by reaction with copper sulfate pentahydrate and ammonia at 80<br>
to 100°C to obtain a chromophore of the formula (1e)<br><br>
which is reacted with a trihalotriazine at 0°C in a neutral medium and subsequent<br>
reaction of the resultant dihalotriazinylbisazo compound (1f)<br><br><br>
with Q-H, where Q is as defined above, to form the compound (1) of the invention.<br>
The separation from their synthesis solution of the compounds of the formula (I)<br>
according to the invention can be effected according to generally known methods for<br>
water-soluble compounds, for example either by precipitating from the reaction<br>
medium by means of electrolytes, for example sodium chloride or potassium<br>
chloride, or by evaporating the reaction solution itself for example by spray drying. In<br>
the latter case it is frequently advisable first to precipitate any suffate in the solution<br>
as calcium sulfate and remove it by filtration.<br>
The dyes of the invention have useful application properties. They are used for<br>
dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in<br>
the form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example<br>
composed of polyamide, or in bulk, as for example of polyamide and polyurethane,<br>
but especially for dyeing or printing these materials in fiber form. Similarly, the as-<br>
synthesized solutions of the dye mixtures of the invention, if appropriate after<br>
addition of a buffer substance and if appropriate after concentrating or diluting, can<br>
be used directly as liquid preparation for dyeing.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to the use of the dyes of the invention for<br>
dyeing or printing these materials, or rather to processes for dyeing or printing these<br>
materials in a conventional manner, by using dyes of the invention as colorant. The<br><br>
materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in the<br>
form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics or yarns, as in the form of hanks or<br>
wound packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example<br>
cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such<br>
as linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example<br>
staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides<br>
and polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other<br>
animal hairs, silk, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dyes of the invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates mentioned,<br>
especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for<br>
water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long<br>
liquor using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as sodium<br>
chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good washfastness. Application is<br>
preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and 105°C, optionally<br>
at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, and optionally in<br>
the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible procedure is to introduce<br>
the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing<br>
temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral<br>
salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also, if desired, only be added<br>
to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
The padding process likewise provides excellent color yields and very good color<br>
build-up on cellulose fibers, the dyes being allowed to become fixed on the material<br>
by batching at room temperature or at elevated temperature, for example at up to<br>
60°C, by steaming or using dry heat in a conventional manner.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried<br><br>
out either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste comprising sodium<br>
bicarbonate or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to<br>
103°C, or two-phase, for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print<br>
color and subsequent fixation either by passing the printed material through a hot<br>
electrolyte-comprising alkaline bath or by overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-<br>
comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching of the alkali-overpadded<br>
material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with dry heat, produce<br>
strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The appearance of<br>
the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix<br>
processes, hot air from 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at<br>
101 to 103°C it is also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam<br>
at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the invention on the<br>
cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of the alkali metals and<br>
likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds which<br>
liberate alkali in the heat. Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and<br>
alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali<br>
metal compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding<br>
agents include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium<br>
dihydrogenphpsphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate,<br>
waterglass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
The cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment by rinsing to<br>
remove unfixed dye portions exhibit very good dye properties and provide by the<br>
application and fixing methods customary in the art for fiber-reactive dyes strong<br>
olive dyeings and prints having very good fastness properties, especially very good<br>
wash-, light-, alkali-, acid-, water-, seawater-, perspiration- and rubfastnesses, on the<br>
materials mentioned in the description, such as cellulose fiber materials, especially<br>
cotton and viscose. The dyeings are further notable for their high degree of fixation<br>
and good build-up on cellulose materials. Of particular advantage is the good<br><br>
washfastness of the dyeings, the high fixation value and the low temperature<br>
dependence compared with the prior art.<br>
Furthermore, the dyes of the invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive dyeing<br>
of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf. for<br>
example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), p.<br>
295-299, especially the finish by the Hercosett process (p. 298); J. Soc. Dyers and<br>
Colourists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed with very good fastness<br>
properties.<br>
The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an<br>
acidic medium. For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and<br>
ammonium acetate or sodium acetate may be added to the dyebath to obtain the<br>
desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a<br>
customary leveling agent, for example on the basis of a reaction product of cyanuric<br>
chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an<br>
aminonaphthalenesuifonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dyes of the invention are<br>
preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic dyebath having a<br>
pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the<br>
dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to a pH<br>
of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between<br>
the dyes of the invention and the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not<br>
reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber<br>
materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a<br>
temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then<br>
adjusted to the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the<br>
actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the<br>
dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at<br>
temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dyes of the invention is<br>
very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing<br><br>
processes. The dyes of the invention dye the materials mentioned in green to olive<br>
shades.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages<br>
are by weight, unless otherwise stated. The compounds described in the examples in<br>
terms of a formula are partly indicated in the form of free acids; in general these<br>
compounds are prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably sodium or<br>
potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of their salts. The starting<br>
compounds mentioned in the following examples, especially table examples, can<br>
similarly be used in the synthesis in the form of the free acid or in the form of their<br>
salts, preferably alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
a) 20.3 parts of 3-amino-4-methoxybenzenesulfonic acid are dissolved in<br>
100 parts of water under neutral conditions and admixed with 30 parts of<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 30 parts of ice. 6.9 parts of sodium nitrite<br>
in 100 parts of water are added with stirring and subsequently stirred in for<br>
60 minutes. Excess nitrite is destroyed with amidosulfonic acid. 15.3 parts of<br>
3,4-dimethoxyaniline are added and the pH is adjusted to 4.0 with 10%<br>
sodium carbonate solution for 2 hours. The precipitated dye is filtered off with<br>
suction.<br>
b) The dye prepared under a) is dissolved under neutral conditions, admixed with<br>
6.9 parts of sodium nitrite and added dropwise with thorough stirring to a<br>
mixture of 30 parts of ice and 50 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid. This<br>
is followed by 15 minutes of stirring when excess nitrite is destroyed with<br>
amidosulfonic acid. 31 parts of 5-hydroxy-1,7-disulfo-2-naphthylamine are<br>
added and the batch is slowly adjusted to pH 5 with 10% sodium carbonate<br>
solution.<br>
c) The reaction solution obtained in b) is admixed with 25 parts of copper sulfate<br>
pentahydrate and a complexing agent, for example ammonia, and heated at<br>
80-100°C for 1-3 hours. The dye is subsequently isolated by salt additon at<br>
room temperature. This provides the chromophore (A):<br><br><br>
(A) may also be prepared in a similar manner by use of 3-amino-<br>
4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid.<br>
d) The chromophore (A) prepared under c) is dissolved under neutral conditions<br>
and admixed with 13.5 parts of trifluorotriazine at 0°C with thorough stirring.<br>
The resultant compound (B) is admixed after 10 minutes with a solution of<br>
15 parts of N-methyl-N-(2-B-sulfatoethytsulfonyl)ethylamine while the pH is<br>
maintained with sodium bicarbonate solution, and the reaction mixture is<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature. Salt is added to isolate the inventive<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
Chromophore (A) is dissolved in 100 parts of water under neutral conditions and<br>
reacted with 18.5 g of trichlorotriazine at 20-40°C to form compound (B). The pH of<br>
the reaction mixture is maintained by addition of 10% sodium carbonate solution.<br>
This is followed by the addition of 18 parts of amine (D):<br><br>
The dye solution is concentrated by membrane desalination and spray dried. This<br>
provides the following dye (E):<br><br><br>
Example 3:<br>
Use of 3-methoxy-4-aminosulfonic acid in example 1 a and 3-methoxy-4-chloroaniline<br>
in example 1b provides the analogous dye (F):<br><br>
Example 4:<br>
Dye (C) is dissolved under neutral conditions and admixed with nicotinic acid. This<br>
provides dye (G):<br><br><br>
Example 5:<br>
The difluorotriazine compound (B) is admixed with 9 parts of morpholine and warmed<br>
to room temperature at pH 7. 20% by weight of salt is added to isolate dye (H) by<br>
filtration.<br><br>
(H)<br>
The table which follows describes further dyes according to the invention which can<br>
be prepared on the lines of the above examples:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 17:<br>
4 parts of the dye of example 2 are dissolved in 200 parts of water. 20 parts of<br>
sodium chloride, 5 parts of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 20 parts of<br>
cotton fabric are added and heated to 60°C in a dyeing machine over 20 min. Dyeing<br>
is carried out at 60°C for 45 min. The cotton fabric is subsequently rinsed with water<br>
and dilute acetic acid and dried. This provides an olive green dyeing having very<br>
good washfastness.<br><br>
