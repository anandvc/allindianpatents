ORGANIC/INORGANIC COMPOSITE POROUS<br>
MEMBRANE AND ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE USING<br>
THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a novel organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator that can ensure electrochemical safety and improve quality at the same time,<br>
and an electrochemical device using the same. More specifically, the present invention<br>
relates to a novel organic/inorganic composite porous separator which contains<br>
inorganic porous particles, each having a plurality of pores therein, as a coating<br>
material to form an organic/inorganic composite porous layer of a uniform pore size<br>
and porosity, and an electrochemical device comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Recently, there is increasing interest in energy storage technology. Batteries have<br>
been widely used as energy sources in portable phones, camcorders, notebook<br>
computers, PCs and electric cars, resulting in intensive research and development for<br>
them. In this regard, electrochemical devices are the subject of great interest. Par-<br>
ticularly, development of rechargeable secondary batteries is the focus of attention.<br>
[3]	Among the currently used secondary batteries, lithium secondary batteries,<br>
developed in early 1990's, have a drive voltage and an energy density higher than those<br>
of conventional batteries using aqueous electrolytes (such as Ni-MH batteries, Ni-Cd<br>
batteries and H SO -Pb batteries) and thus are spotlighted in the field of secondary<br>
2 4<br>
batteries. However, lithium secondary batteries have problems related to their safety,<br>
due to ignition and explosion caused by the use of organic electrolytes, and are man-<br>
ufactured by a complicated process. lithium ion polymer batteries, appearing more<br>
recently, solve the above-mentioned disadvantages of secondary lithium ion batteries,<br>
and thus become one of the most potent candidates of next generation batteries.<br>
However, such secondary lithium ion polymer batteries still have low capacity<br>
compared to secondary lithium ion batteries. Particularly, they show insufficient<br>
discharge capacity at low temperature. Hence, there is an imminent need for the im-<br>
provement of secondary lithium ion batteries.<br>
[4]	A lithium ion battery is manufactured by coating a cathode active material (e.g.<br>
LiCoO2) and an anode active material (e.g. graphite), which have crystal structures<br><br>
including interstitial volumes, onto the corresponding current collector (i.e. aluminum<br>
foil and copper foil, respectively) to provide a cathode and an anode. Then, a separator<br>
is interposed between both electrodes to form an electrode assembly, and an electrolyte<br>
is injected into the electrode assembly. During a charge cycle of the battery, lithium in-<br>
tercalated into the crystal structure of the cathode active material is deintercalated, and<br>
then intercalated into the crystal structure of the anode active material. On the other<br>
hand, during a discharge cycle, lithium intercalated into the anode active material is<br>
deintercalated again, and then intercalated back into the crystal structure of the<br>
cathode. As charge/discharge cycles are repeated, lithium ions reciprocate between the<br>
cathode and the anode. In this regard, a lithium ion battery is also referred to as a<br>
rocking chair battery.<br>
[5]	Such batteries have been produced by many battery producers. However, most<br>
lithium secondary batteries have different safety characteristics depending on several<br>
factors. Evaluation of and security in safety of batteries are very important matters to<br>
be considered. Particularly, users should be protected from being damaged by mal-<br>
functioning batteries. Therefore, safety of batteries is strictly restricted in terms of<br>
ignition and combustion of batteries by safety standards.<br>
[6]	Many attempts have been made to solve the problem related to the safety of a<br>
battery, However, ignition of a battery, caused by a forced internal short circuit due to<br>
external impacts (particularly, in the case of a customer-abused battery) cannot be<br>
solved yet.<br>
[7]	Recently, US Patent No. 6.432,586 discloses a polyolefin-based separator coated<br>
with an inorganic layer such as calcium carbonate, silica, etc., so as to prevent an<br>
internal short circuit, caused by dendrite growth inside of a battery. However, in case<br>
of adopting such an inorganic composite layer, the battery, compared with the con-<br>
ventional battery using a polymer separator, gets heavier and its quality is deteriorated.<br>
In particular, since a part of non-porous inorganic particles in the inorganic material<br>
layer influences as resistance to the movement of lithium ions that determines quality<br>
of a battery, it is fundamentally not possible to avoid the quality deterioration of the<br>
battery. Moreover, an increase in weight by the inorganic material layer causes a<br>
decrease in energy density of the battery per unit weight. If the inorganic substance<br>
content in the coating layer is reduced to solve this, however, it poses another problem<br>
that a satisfactory level of an internal short circuit prevention function is not obtained.<br>
[8]	Meanwhile, the international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) defines<br>
a pore of 2nm or shorter in diameter as a micropore, a pore of 2 to 50nm in diameter as<br><br>
a mesopore, and a pore of 50nm or greater in diameter as a macropore. Porous<br>
materials are expected to hold interest continuously not only for industrial applications<br>
but also for academic aspects. Pores are something to be removed in the field of<br>
powder metallurgy to obtain a sintered compact, and regarded as defects to be<br>
controlled in a casting process to manufacture a sound casting. Nevertheless, a porous<br>
material having pores of uniform size and regular arrangement is continuously utilized<br>
in various industries that appreciate adsorption and separation efficiency of the porous<br>
material. Manufacturing methods of such porous materials include a self-assembly<br>
technique, an aerogel manufacturing technique through a sol-gel process, an anodic<br>
oxidation technique of aluminum, a condensation drying technique and the like,<br>
However, these techniques are mainly used for manufacturing films or monolith<br>
porous materials, not for particles.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[9]	In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
an organic/inorganic composite porous separator formed of (a) a porous substrate, (b)<br>
an organic/inorganic composite layer, and (c) inorganic particles with pore structures<br>
of uniform size, in which the organic/inorganic composite coating layer formed on the<br>
porous substrate contains inorganic porous particles having a number of macropores,<br>
so that the flow of lithium ions may progress smoothly, degree of swelling with<br>
electrolyte may be improved, and energy density per unit weight of a device may be<br>
significantly increased due to a substantial decrease in the weight of the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[10]	An aspect of the present invention provides an organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator, which comprises: (a) a porous substrate having pores; and (b) an organic/<br>
inorganic composite layer formed by coating at least one region selected from the<br>
group consisting of a surface of the substrate and a part of pores present in the<br>
substrate with a mixture of inorganic porous particles and a binder polymer, wherein<br>
the inorganic porous particles have a plurality of macropores with a diameter of 50nm<br>
or greater in the particle itself thereby form a pore structure; and an electrochemical<br>
device (preferably, a lithium secondary battery) comprising the same.<br>
[11]	Another aspect of the present invention provides a manufacturing method of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous separator, which includes the steps of: (a)<br><br>
dispersing inorganic precursors and heat-decomposable compounds in a dispersion<br>
medium, misting the inorganic precursor solution, and performing a thermal de-<br>
composition and a crystallization processes, to thereby prepare inorganic porous<br>
particles; (b) adding and mixing the inorganic porous particles obtained from step (a)<br>
with a polymer solution containing a binder polymer; and (c) coating the mixture<br>
obtained from step (b) on at least one region selected from the group consisting of a<br>
surface of the substrate having pores and a part of the pores in the substrate, followed<br>
by drying.<br>
[12]	Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in further detail.<br>
[13]	The present invention is characterized in that it utilizes inorganic porous particles as<br>
a component for an organic/inorganic composite layer (active layer) coated on a<br>
porous substrate having pores.<br>
[14]	As an attempt to resolve poor thermal safety of a conventional polymer separator, a<br>
composite separator containing inorganic particles in a polymer separator substrate<br>
was used. However, the inorganic particles provided here were non-porous inorganic<br>
particles (see FIG. 3). Besides, even though there may be some pores, they were only<br>
micropores having a diameter of 2nm or less (see FIG. 4). Therefore, the conventional<br>
separator as an end product (i.e., a solid electrolyte) also has a dense inorganic coating<br>
layer with no pores, or, if any, it fails to serve as an effective spacer for transmitting<br>
lithium ions because it has an irregular pore structure with the pore size in unit of<br>
angstrom (A) (see FIG. 1 for reference). In other words, despite the improvement of<br>
thermal safety, the battery can still have a degraded quality due to a low porosity.<br>
[15]	On the contrary, the organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the<br>
present invention is distinct from the ones in the art in that it contains many inorganic<br>
porous particles with macropores of uniform size and shape (see FIG. 5).<br>
[16]	Pores in the separator function not only as a pathway of an active component, e.g.,<br>
lithium ions (Li +) resulting in electrochemical reactions in an electrochemical device,<br>
but also as a space where an electrolyte transmitting lithium ions swells. After all, an<br>
increase of pores means an increase of the pathway for lithium ions and an expansion<br>
of the electrolyte swelling space. From this viewpoint, the pore size and the porosity<br>
are very important factors for the control of ion conductivity in a battery and thus, are<br>
directly related to the quality of the battery.<br>
[17]	That is, in a case that lithium ions causing an electrochemical reaction in a lithium<br>
secondary battery travel to both electrodes, pores in a separator placed between both<br>
electrodes can theoretically work as a pathway for the lithium ions as long as the pores<br><br>
have a diameter equal to or greater than that of the lithium ion. For information, the<br>
diameter of the lithium ion is several angstroms (A). In reality, however, when lithium<br>
ions travel to both electrodes, they do not travel alone but are solvated by a number of<br>
molecules of carbonate based compounds for example in the electrolyte as a transfer<br>
medium. Therefore, if pore size or porosity of the separator is within the approximate<br>
range of the diameter of the lithium ion, the mobility of lithium ions is reduced and<br>
hence, their ion conductivity in the battery is decreased, leading to degraded battery<br>
quality.<br>
[18]	For example, in a case that the electrolyte contains ethylene carbonate (EC)<br>
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and the like, lithium ions are solvated, being tightly en-<br>
compassed by four EC or DMC molecules relatively bigger than them, and travel<br>
towards both electrodes. Here, the size of electrolyte molecules is about 1 to 2nm or<br>
bigger. To improve the battery quality, therefore, it is important to take both the size of<br>
a lithium ion and the size of an electrolyte molecule into consideration.<br>
[19]	The organic/inorganic composite porous separator (membrane) according to the<br>
present invention consists of (a) a porous substrate; and (b) an organic/inorganic<br>
composite layer formed on the substrate. As shown in FIGs. 2, 6 and 7, both the porous<br>
substrate (a) and the organic/inorganic composite layer (b) have a number of regular<br>
(or uniform) pore structures that are large enough for title electrolyte molecules and the<br>
solvated lithium ions to pass through and at the same time, the inorganic particles (c)<br>
contained in the organic/inorganic composite layer are structurally characterized with<br>
macropores that are sufficiently large to be able to transmit the electrolyte molecules<br>
and the solvated lithium ions. Such a triple porous structure means a high degree of<br>
swelling of electrolytes as well as an increase in the pathway of lithium ions in the<br>
electrolyte-filled space, so the lithium ion conductivity may be improved and elec-<br>
trochemical reactions in the battery are activated, demonstrating an equivalent<br>
performance to the conventional polyolefin-based separator (see FIG. 1).<br>
[20]	In addition, although the organic/inorganic composite layer used as a component or<br>
a coating component of the conventional separator could ensure safety of a battery, its<br>
use of non-porous inorganic particles which are heavy brought an increase in the total<br>
weight of the battery. On the other hand, the present invention used inorganic porous<br>
particles retaining a number of macropores therein, to thereby achieve improved safety<br>
and quality of a battery as well as a markedly reduced weight. This leads to a reduction<br>
of the battery weight, eventually increasing energy density per unit weight of the<br>
battery.<br><br>
[21]	In the organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention, one component present in the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
coated onto the surface of a porous substrate and/or part of the pores in the substrate is<br>
inorganic particles that are typically used in the art. Hence, there is no particular<br>
limitation in selection of inorganic particles in terms of components and shapes, as<br>
long as they are big enough to transmit electrolyte molecules and solvated lithium ions.<br>
Nevertheless, it is preferable to use inorganic particles having macropores of 50nm or<br>
greater in diameter.<br>
[22]	As aforementioned, a macropore is defined by IUPAC as a pore having a diameter<br>
of 50nm or greater. The macropores may exist individually or combined in the particle.<br>
[23]	There is no particular limitation in porosity of the inorganic porous particles. The<br>
porosity can be adjusted diversely within a range of 30 to 95%, preferably, 50 to 90%.<br>
If porosity of the porous particle is below 30%, it is difficult to expect swelling of an<br>
electrolyte to the pores existing in the porous particle and further the improvement of<br>
battery performance. Meanwhile, if porosity of the porous particle exceeds 95%,<br>
mechanical strength of the particle itself can be weakened. Such a pore structure within<br>
the set range serves as an additional pathway of lithium ions and the space for<br>
electrolyte to swell, contributing to the improvement of battery performance.<br>
[24]	Moreover, as surface area of the inorganic porous particle increases significantly<br>
due to plural pores existing in the particle itself, the density is reduced. In the field,<br>
inorganic particles with high density are not easily dispersed during a coating process<br>
and cause a problem like an increase in the weight of a battery. Therefore, it is desired<br>
to use inorganic particles with density as low as possible. For example, the density and<br>
the surface area of the inorganic porous particle may fall within a range of 1 to 4g/cc<br>
and a range of 10 to 50m2/g, respectively.<br>
[25]	Furthermore, the inorganic porous particle in the organic/inorganic composite layer<br>
formed on the porous substrate: serves to form pores with an interstitial volume formed<br>
among inorganic particles as they bond to each other and at the same time, functions as<br>
a spacer helping the organic/inorganic composite layer maintain its physical shape.<br>
[26]	There is no particular limitation in materials for the inorganic porous particles as<br>
long as they are electrochemically stable and are not subjected to oxidation and/or<br>
reduction at the range of drive voltages (for example, 0-5V based on Li/Li +) of a<br>
battery to which they are applied. In particular, it is preferable to use inorganic<br>
particles having ion conductivity as high as possible, because such inorganic particles<br>
can improve ion conductivity and performance in an electrochemical device. Ad-<br><br>
ditionally, inorganic particles having high dielectric constant are desirably used<br>
because they can contribute to an increase in the dissociation degree of an electrolyte<br>
salt in a liquid electrolyte, say, a lithium salt, to thereby improve the ion conductivity<br>
of the electrolyte.<br>
[27]	For these reasons, it is desirable to use inorganic particles having a high dielectric<br>
constant of 5 or more, inorganic particles having lithium conductivity or mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
[28]	Non-limiting examples of inorganic particles having a dielectric constant of 5 or<br>
more include BaTiO3, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) Pb1-x LaxZr1-yTiyO3(PLZT), PB(Mg3Nb2/3)O3-<br><br>
PbTiO3(PMN-PT) hafnia (HfO2), SrTiO3, SnO2, CeO2, MgO, NiO, CaO, ZnO, ZrO2,<br><br>
Y2O3, Al2O3, TiO2, SiC or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[29]	As used herein, "inorganic particles having lithium ion conductivity" are referred to<br>
as inorganic particles containing lithium elements and having a capability of<br>
conducting lithium ions without storing lithium. Inorganic particles having lithium ion<br>
conductivity can conduct and move lithium ions due to defects present in their<br>
structure, and thus can improve lithium ion conductivity and contribute to the im-<br>
provement of battery performance. Non-limiting examples of such inorganic particles<br>
having lithium ion conductivity include: lithim phosphate (Li3PO4) lithium titanium<br><br>
phosphate (LixTiy(PO4)3, 0<x lithium aluminium titanium phosphate al></x><br>

BaLa2Ta2O12,Li3VO4, Li3PO4/Li4SiO4,Li2S-GeS2-P2S5, Li2S-P2S5, Li2S-GeS2-Ga2S3, Li<br><br>
2S-SiS2, Li2S-P2S5, Li2S-P2S5-SiS2 and the like.<br><br>
[30]	The above-described inorganic particles, that have never been used as separators,<br>
for example Pb(Zr,Ti)O3(PZT) Pb1-xLaxZr1-yTiyO3(PLZT) Pb(Mg3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3<br><br>
(PMN-PT) hafnia (HfO ) etc., have a high dielectric constant of 100 or more. The<br>
inorganic particles also have piezoelectricity so that an electric potential can be<br>
generated between both surfaces by the charge formation, when they are drawn or<br>
compressed under the application of a certain pressure. Therefore, the inorganic<br>
particles can prevent internal short circuit between both electrodes, thereby con-<br><br>
tributing to improve the safety of a battery. Additionally, when such inorganic particles<br>
having a high dielectric constant are combined with inorganic particles having lithium<br>
ion conductivity, synergic effects can be obtained.<br>
[31]	Although there is no particular limitation in size of inorganic porous particles,<br>
inorganic porous particles are in size from 0.001 m to 10 m. When the size is less<br>
than 0.001 /an, inorganic porous particles have poor dispersibility so that structure and<br>
physical properties of the organic/inorganic composite porous separator cannot be<br>
controlled with ease. When the size is greater than 10 m, the resultant organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator has an increased thickness under the same solid<br>
content, resulting in degradation in mechanical properties. Furthermore, such ex-<br>
cessively large pores may increase a possibility of an internal short circuit being<br>
generated during repeated charge/discharge cycles.<br>
[32]	A preferable pore size of the inorganic porous particle itself is in a range of 0.05 to<br>
1 m, but it is not limited thereto. When the pore size is less than 0.05 m, it is so small<br>
that the electrolyte cannot get through. Meanwhile, when the pore size is greater than 1<br>
m, the inorganic porous particles become so large that the thickness of the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator can be increased.<br>
[33]	The inorganic porous particles present in the mixture of the inorganic porous<br>
particles and the binder polymer for forming the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator are preferably in an amount of 50 to 97 wt%, more preferably in an amount<br>
of 80 to 95 wt% with respect to 100 wt% of the total weight of the mixture. When the<br>
content of the inorganic porous particles is less than 50 wt%, the binder polymer is<br>
present in such a large amount that the interstitial volume formed among the inorganic<br>
porous particles is decreased and farther the pore size and porosity are decreased,<br>
resulting in degradation in the quality of a battery. On the other hand, when the content<br>
of the inorganic porous particles is greater than 97 wt%, the polymer content is too low<br>
to provide sufficient adhesion among the inorganic particles, resulting in degradation<br>
in mechanical properties of an end product of the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator.<br>
[34]	In the organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention, a binder polymer currently used in the art is another component present in<br>
the organic/inorganic composite layer formed on the surface of the porous substrate or<br>
on a part of the pores in the porous substrate.<br>
[35]	It is desirable to use a polymer that does not melt in an electrolyte but is gelled with<br>
a liquid electrolyte, so that the inorganic particles can be stably fixed to improve their<br><br>
structural safety and further the battery performance can be improved by high ion con-<br>
ductivity and an increase in the degree of swelling of the liquid electrolyte.<br>
[36]	In the present invention, the binder polymers preferably have a glass transition<br>
temperature (T ) as low as possible, more preferably T of between -200 °C and 200 °C,<br>
g	g<br>
because they can improve mechanical properties such as flexibility and elasticity of a<br>
final coating layer.<br>
[37]	When the binder polymer has ion conductivity, it can farther improve the<br>
performance of an electrochemical device. Therefore, the binder polymer preferably<br>
has a dielectric constant as high as possible. In practice, because the dissociation<br>
degree of a salt in an electrolyte depends on the dielectric constant of a solvent used in<br>
the electrolyte, the polymer having a higher dielectric constant can increase the dis-<br>
sociation degree of a salt in the electrolyte used in the present invention. The dielectric<br>
constant of the polymer may range from 1.0 to 100 (as measured at a frequency of 1<br>
kHz) and is preferably 10 or more.<br>
[38]	When a polymer having a high degree of swelling is used, the polymer may absorb<br>
the electrolyte infiltrated after assemblage of a battery to be provided with electrolyte<br>
ion conductivity. Further, since the polymer has excellent affinity to electrolytes, it can<br>
be applied to a polar electrolyte for battery use that was regarded to be difficult to use.<br>
Additionally, when binder polymers that can be gelled and swelled with a liquid<br>
electrolyte is used, such binder polymers can form a gel type organic/inorganic<br>
composite electrolyte through a reaction between the infiltrate electrolyte and the<br>
polymer. Such electrolyte, compared with the conventional gel type electrolyte, is easy<br>
to be prepared and demonstrates high ion conductivity and a high degree of swelling,<br>
thereby contributing to the improvement of battery performance. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to use a polymer having a solubility parameter of between 15 and 45 MPa ,<br>
more preferably of between 15 and 25 MPa , and between 30 and 45 MPa . When<br>
the binder polymer has a solubility parameter of less than 15 Mpa or greater than 45<br>
Mpa , it has a difficulty in swelling with a conventional liquid electrolyte for battery<br>
use.<br>
[39]	Non-limiting examples of the binder polymer that may be used in the present<br>
invention include polyvinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene, polyvinylidene<br>
fluoride-co-trichloroethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polyacrylonitrile,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate, polyethylene<br>
oxide, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, cya-<br>
noethylpullulan, cyanoethyl polyvinylalcohol, cyanoethylcellulose, cyanoethylsucrose,<br><br>
pullulan, carboxymetyl cellulose, acrylonitrile-styrene-butadiene copolymer,<br>
polyimide or mixtures thereof. Other materials may be used alone or in combination,<br>
as long as they satisfy the above characteristics.<br>
[40]	The organic/inorganic composite layer forming the organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous separator of the present invention may farther comprise additives other than the<br>
inorganic porous particles and binder polymer.<br>
[41]	There is no particular limitation in the substrate in the organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous separator according to the present invention, as long as it is a porous substrate<br>
having pores. For example, a polyolefin-based separator typically used in the art, a<br>
heat resistant porous substrate having a melting point of 200°C and the like may be<br>
used also. Especially, the heat-resistant substrate can ensure good thermal safety of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous separator by fundamentally resolving the separator<br>
shrinkage problem observed in the conventional separator due to external and/or<br>
internal thermal impacts.<br>
[42]	Non-limiting examples of the porous substrate that may be used include high<br>
density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene,<br>
ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polybutylene terephthalate, polyester, polyacetal, polyamide, polycarbonate,<br>
polyimide, polyetherether ketone, polyether sulfone, polyphenylene oxide,<br>
polyphenylene sulfidro, polyethylene naphthalene or mixtures thereof. However, other<br>
heat resistant engineering plastics may be used with no particular limitation.<br>
[43]	Although there is no particular limitation in thickness of the porous substrate, the<br>
porous substrate preferably has a thickness of between 1 m and 100 m, more<br>
preferably of between 5 m and 50 m. When the porous substrate has a thickness of<br>
less than 1 m, it is difficult to maintain mechanical properties. Meanwhile, when the<br>
porous substrate has a thickness of greater than 100 m, it may function as resistance<br>
layer.<br>
[44]	Although there is no particular limitation in pore size and porosity of the porous<br>
substrate, the porous substrate preferably has a porosity of between 5% and 95%. The<br>
pore size (diameter) preferably ranges from 0.01 m to 50 m, more preferably from 0.1<br>
m to 20 m. When the pore size and porosity are less than 0.01 m and 5%, re-<br>
spectively, the porous substrate may function as resistance layer. However, when the<br>
pore size and porosity are greater than 50 m and 95%, respectively, it is difficult to<br>
maintain mechanical properties.<br>
[45]	The porous substrate may take the form of a membrane or fiber. When the porous<br><br>
substrate is fibrous, it may be a nonwoven web forming a porous web (preferably,<br>
spunbond type web comprising long fibers or melt blown type web).<br>
[46]	Although there is no particular limitation in the thickness of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite layer formed by coating the porous substrate with the mixture of inorganic<br>
porous particles and the binder polymer, the thickness is preferably in a range of 1 to<br>
100 m. In addition, pore size and porosity of the organic/inorganic composite layer<br>
formed by the interstitial volume among the inorganic porous particles are preferably<br>
in a range of 0.05 to 10m and 5 to 95 %, respectively.<br>
[47]	Moreover, although there is no particular limitation in thickness of the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator according to the present invention, it is<br>
preferably in a range of 5 to 100 m, more preferably of between 10 and 30 m.<br>
However, this thickness can be controlled in relation to the battery performance.<br>
[48]	The organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention may be manufactured by a conventional process known to one skilled in the<br>
art. One embodiment of a method for manufacturing the organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous separator according to the present invention, includes the steps of: (a)<br>
dissolving a binder polymer into a solvent to form a polymer solution; (b) adding<br>
inorganic porous particles to the polymer solution obtained from step (a) and mixing<br>
them; and (c) coating the mixture of inorganic porous particles with binder polymer<br>
obtained from step (b) on the surface of a substrate having pores or on a part of the<br>
pores in the substrate, followed by drying.<br>
[49]	First, 1) inorganic porous particles are added and dispersed in a polymer solution to<br>
prepare a mixture of the inorganic porous particles and the binder polymer.<br>
[50]	The inorganic porous particles may be prepared according to a typical method used<br>
in the art, for example, a self-assembly process, a sol-gel method, a condensation-<br>
drying method, a spray pyrolysis method, or a combination thereof. Especially, the<br>
spray pyrolysis method is preferred.<br>
[51]	According to a preferred embodiment, the inorganic porous particles can be<br>
prepared by dispersing inorganic precursors and heat-decomposable compounds in a<br>
dispersion medium, misting the inorganic precursor solution, and performing a thermal<br>
decomposition and a crystallization processes.<br>
[52]	There is no particular limitation in the inorganic precursors, as long as they contain<br>
at least one of the typical inorganic components. For instance, in case of preparing<br>
alumina, aluminum containing salts such as aluminum nitrate, aluminum chloride,<br>
aluminum acetate, aluminum sulfate and the like may be used. Moreover, a nano<br><br>
alumina such as filmed alumina having a stable dispersed phase may also be used as<br>
the precursor material.<br>
[53]	There is no particular limitation in the heat-decomposable compounds, as long as<br>
they are pyrolyzed at a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the<br>
inorganic particles. Such examples include polymers or foaming agents. In particular,<br>
polystyrene is preferred. Although there is no particular limitation in shape of the heat-<br>
decomposable compounds either, bead shaped compounds are desired for the<br>
formation of uniform pores.<br>
[54]	In order to prepare porous particles by the spray pyrolysis method, it is necessary to<br>
disperse uniform-sized, heat-decomposable beads (e.g., polystyrene in the present<br>
invention) having been prepared in an inorganic precursor solution. Such a precursor<br>
solution is misted through a liquid aerosol generator, and droplets thusly obtained then<br>
pass through a high-temperature reactor, being subjected to the drying and thermal de-<br>
composition processes, and are crystallized to produce inorganic porous particles.<br>
[55]	There is no particular limitation in the temperature for the thermal treatment, as<br>
long as it is higher than the decomposition temperature of the heat-decomposable<br>
compounds. The heat-decomposable compounds after the thermal treatment are all<br>
decomposed in a reactor, and parts filled with the compounds become pores. The<br>
resulting inorganic porous particles may have various pore sizes and porosities,<br>
depending on size and mixing ratio of the heat-decomposable compounds.<br>
[56]	Later, the inorganic porous particles are added and dissolved in a polymer solution.<br>
Here, non-limiting examples of the solvent for dissolving polymers include acetone,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, N-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone, cyclohexane, water or mixtures thereof.<br>
[57]	It is preferable to perform a step of pulverizing inorganic particles after adding the<br>
inorganic porous particles to the prepared polymer solution. Conventional pul-<br>
verization methods, preferably a method using a ball mill, may be used.<br>
[58]	In order to control the pore size, porosity and thickness of the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator to be formed finally, factors for controlling pores of the<br>
separator, such as, the pore size, porosity, size (particle diameter) content of the<br>
inorganic porous particle, and a composition (mixing) ratio of the inorganic porous<br>
particles to the binder polymer can be properly controlled. For instance, as the weight<br>
ratio (I/P) of the inorganic particles (I) to the polymer (P) increases, porosity of the<br>
organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present invention<br>
increases. Therefore, the thickness of the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br><br>
increases under the same solid content (weight of the inorganic particles + weight of<br>
the binder polymer). Additionally, the pore size increases in proportion to the pore<br>
formation among the inorganic particles. When the size (particle diameter) of the<br>
inorganic particles increases, interstitial distance among the inorganic particles<br>
increases, thereby increasing the pore size.<br>
[59]	2) The mixture of the prepared inorganic porous particles and the binder polymer is<br>
coated onto the prepared porous substrate having pores, followed by drying to obtain<br>
the organic/inorganic composite porous separator of the present invention. Here, as for<br>
the coating step, any methods known to one skilled in the art including dip coating, die<br>
coating, roll coating, comma coating or combinations thereof may be used.<br>
[60]	The organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention is formed by coating it directly on the surface of a porous substrate having<br>
pores so that the pores on the porous substrate and the organic/inorganic composite<br>
layer can be anchored to each other, thereby providing a firm physical, organic<br>
bonding between the organic/inorganic composite layer and the porous substrate.<br>
Meanwhile, the pore structures: existing between the organic/inorganic composite layer<br>
and each of the inorganic porous particles may be retained without getting interfered<br>
with each other. Therefore, problems related with mechanical properties such as<br>
brittleness can be improved. Additionally, such increased interfacial adhesion between<br>
the pore substrate and the organic/inorganic composite coating layer can decrease the<br>
interfacial resistance.<br>
[61]	The organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention, obtained as described above, may be used as separator in an electrochemical<br>
device, preferably in a lithium secondary battery. If the binder polymer is a polymer<br>
that can be gelled when swelled with a liquid electrolyte, the polymer may react with<br>
the electrolyte injected after assembling a battery by using the separator, and thus be<br>
gelled to form a gel type organic/inorganic composite electrolyte.<br>
[62]	Further, the present invention provides an electrochemical device comprising: a<br>
cathode; an anode; the organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the<br>
present invention, interposed between the cathode and anode; and an electrolyte.<br>
[63]	Such electrochemical devices include any devices in which electrochemical<br>
reactions occur and particular examples thereof include all kinds of primary batteries,<br>
secondary batteries, fuel cells, solar cells or capacitors. Particularly, the lithium<br>
secondary battery among the secondary batteries is preferred. Examples of such<br>
include a lithium metal secondary battery, lithium ion secondary battery, lithium<br><br>
polymer secondary battery or lithium ion polymer secondary battery.<br>
[64]	The electrochemical device may be manufactured by a conventional method known<br>
to one skilled in the art. In one. embodiment of the method for manufacturing the elec-<br>
trochemical device, the electrochemical device is provided by forming an electrode<br>
assembly from the organic/inorganic composite porous separator interposed between a<br>
cathode and anode, and then by injecting an electrolyte into the assembly.<br>
[65]	There is no particular limitation in a cathode, an anode and a liquid electrolyte to be<br>
used with the organic/inorganic composite porous separator, and any of those that can<br>
be used in a conventional electrochemical device may be used.<br>
[66]	There is an advantage that a battery can be assembled with ease in that the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator of the present invention can demonstrate<br>
excellent adhesion by controlling the contents of inorganic particles and binder<br>
polymer present in the organic/inorganic composite layer in the separator, physically<br>
properties of the polymer and the like.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[78]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention. It is to be understood that the following examples are illustrative only and<br>
the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
[79]	[EXAMPLE 1-5] Preparation of organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator and Manufacture of lithium secondary battery using the<br>
same<br>
[80]	Example 1<br>
[81]	1.1 Preparation of inorganic; alumina porous particles<br>
[82]	As an alumina precursor compound, aluminum nitrate was dissolved in distilled<br>
water to make a solution of 0.2M. After the aluminum nitrate was completely<br>
dissolved in the distilled water, the prepared polystyrene beads of 100 nm in diameter<br>
were added to the solution at an amount of 45% by weight of the alumina, and suf-<br>
ficiently stirred. FIG. 8 shows an SEM photograph of the polystyrene beads used at<br>
this time. A precursor solution thusly obtained was injected into a spray pyrolysis<br>
device to thereby prepare inorganic alumina porous particles. SEM photographs of<br>
such alumina porous particles are shown in FIGs, 5 and 8.<br>
[83]	1-2. Preparation of organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
(PVdF-CTFE/porous Al2O3]<br>
[84]	PVdF-CTFE polymer (polyvinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer)<br>
was added to acetone in the amount of about 5 wt% and dissolved therein at 50 °C for<br>
about 12 hours or more to form a polymer solution. To the polymer solution obtained<br>
as" described above, Al2O3 powder prepared in the Example 1-1, having a pore size of<br>
100 nm and porosity of 75%, was added to make Al2O3 / PVdF-CTFE = 80/20 (wt%).<br>
Then, the Al2O3 powder was pulverized and dispersed for about 12 hours or more by<br>
using a ball mill method to form slurry. The particle size of porous Al2O3 in the slurry<br><br>
can be controlled depending on the size (particle size) of beads used in the ball mill<br>
method and ball milling time, but in this Example the alumina was pulverized into a<br>
particle size of about 400 nm to provide slurry. Then, the slurry was coated on surface<br>
of a polyethylene film (porosity: 45%) by using a dip coating process to a thickness of<br>
about 18 m, and a coating layer thickness was adjusted to about 3 m. After measuring<br>
with a porosimeter, the organic/inorganic composite layer coated on the polyethylene<br>
film had a pore size of 0.4 m and a porosity of 55%, respectively, and a pore structure<br>
thereof is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[85]	1-3. Manufacture of lithium secondary battery<br>
[86]	(Manufacture of cathode)<br>
[87]	To N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent, 94 wt% of lithium cobalt<br>
composite oxide (LiCoO2) as cathode active material, 3 wt% of carbon black as<br>
conductive agent and 3 wt% of PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) as binder were added<br>
to form slurry for a cathode. The slurry was coated on Al foil having a thickness of 20<br>
m as cathode collector and dried to form a cathode. Then, the cathode was subjected<br>
to roll press.<br>
[88]	(Manufacture of anode)<br>
[89]	To N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent, 96 wt% of carbon powder as anode<br>
active material, 3 wt% of PVDF as binder and 1 wt% of carbon black as conductive<br>
agent were added to form mixed slurry for an anode. The slurry was coated on Cu foil<br>
having a thickness of 10 m as anode collector and dried to form an anode. Then, the<br>
anode was subjected to roll press.<br>
[90]	(Manufacture of battery)<br>
[91]	The cathode and anode obtained as described above were stacked with the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator obtained as described in Example 1-2 to form an<br>
assembly. Then, an electrolyte (ethylene carbonate (EC)/ethylemethyl carbonate<br>
(EMC)= 1:2 (volume ratio) containing IM of lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6))<br><br>
was injected thereto to provide a lithium secondary battery.<br>
[92]	Example 2<br>
[93]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that PVDF-<br>
HFP was used instead of PVDF-CTFE to obtain an organic/inorganic composite<br>
porous separator (PVdF-HFP/porous Al2O3).<br>
[94]	Example 3<br>
[95]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that powder<br>
of porous TiO2 was used instead of porous Al2O3 powder to obtain an organic/<br><br>
inorganic composite porous separator (PVdF-CTFE/TiO2).<br>
[96]	Example 4<br>
[97]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that porous<br>
Al2O3 powder having pore size of 0.1 m (lOOnm) and porosity of 53% was used to<br>
form slurry and the slurry was coated onto a polyethylene terephthalate porous film<br>
(porosity: 80%) having a thickness of about 20 m to obtain an organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator for the battery. After measuring with a porosimeter, the<br>
active layer impregnated into and coated on the porous polyethylene terephthalate<br>
substrate had a average pore size of 0.3 m and a porosity of 71 %.<br>
[98]	Example 5<br>
[99]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that porous<br>
TiO2 powder having the same pore size and porosity as the porous Al2O3 powder and a<br>
polyethylene terephthalate porous film were used to obtain an organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator (PVdF-CTFE/ porous TiO2) for the battery. After<br>
measuring with a porosimeter, an average pore size and porosity were of 0.3 m and a<br>
porosity of 66%, respectively.<br>
[100]	fComparative Examples 1-3]<br>
[101]	Comparative Example 1<br>
[102]	Example 1 was repeated to provide an organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separator and a lithium secondary battery, except that conventional non-porous<br>
inorganic particles (Al2O3) were used instead of the porous inorganic particles (Al2O3).<br>
An SEM phorograph of the non-porous inorganic particle is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
[103]	Comparative Example 2<br>
[104]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that a con-<br>
ventional PE film in the art was used.<br>
[105]	Comparative Example 3<br>
[106]	Example 1 was repeated to provide a lithium secondary battery, except that zeolite<br>
having a pore size of 1nm and porosity of 33% was used instead of the porous<br>
inorganic particles (Al2O3) to obtain an organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
for the battery. An SEM photograph of zeolite having a pore size of about lnm is<br>
shown in FIG. 4.<br>
[107] Experimental Example 1. Analysis of inorganic porous particle<br>
[108]	The following test was performed to analyze characteristics of inorganic porous<br>
particles present in an organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
[109]	The sample used in this test was porous Al2O3 obtained according to Examples 1<br>
and 2. As control, a non-porous Al2O3 having the same component as the porous<br>
particle used in Comparative Example 1 and zeolite of Comparative Example 3 were<br>
used.<br>
[110] When analyzed by using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) the non-porous<br>
Al2O3 particle used in Comparative Example 1 had an irregular structure without pores<br>
(see FIG. 3 for reference). In addition, zeolite used in Comparative Example 3 had<br>
pores, but they were too small to be observed even with the SEM (see FIG. 4 for<br>
reference). On the contrary, the porous Al2O3 particle used in the Examples of the<br>
present invention was in a spherical shape and had pores both in its surface and inside<br>
(see FIGs. 5 and 8 for reference).<br>
[Ill]	Such a configuration feature was also confirmed through a surface analysis. When<br>
the surface area of each particle was measured by a nitrogen adsorption method, the<br>
surface area of the non-porous Al2O3 particle of Comparative Example 1 was only 6.4<br>
m /g, but the surface area of the. porous Al2O3 particle used in Examples 1 and 2 was<br><br>
about 33.9 m2/g, which is about; 5 times larger than the surface area of the non-porous<br>
particle (see Table 1 for reference). An analysis can be drawn that such an increase in<br>
the surface area is resulted from pores present in the porous Al2O3 particle.<br>
[112]	Experimental Example 2. Property analysis of organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator<br>
[113]	The following experiment was performed to analyze the surface of the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator obtained according to the present invention.<br>
[114]	2-1. Surface analysis (SEM)<br>
[115]	The sample used in this test was the composite porous separator obtained by<br>
coating the porous Al2O3/PVdF-CTFE onto the polyethylene film obtained according<br>
to Example 1.<br>
[116]	When analyzed by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) the organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator according to the present invention showed a<br>
uniform (or regular) pore structure wherein both the polyethylene film substrate (see<br>
FIG. 7) and the organic/inorganic composite layer to which the porous Al2O3 was<br>
introduced (see FIG. 6) had pores of 1 mm or less, and pores were formed in the<br>
porous particle itself.<br>
[117]	2-2. Analysis of physical properties<br>
[118]	The sample used in this test was the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
obtained by coating the porous Al2O3 /PVdF-CTFE onto the polyethylene film obtained<br><br>
according to Example 1. As control, the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
obtained by coating the non-porous Al2O3 /PVdF-CTFE onto the polyethylene film<br>
obtained according to Comparative Example 1, the conventional polyethylene film of<br>
Comparative Example 2, and the organic/inorganic composite porous separator of<br>
Comparative Example 3 that is obtained by using zeolite with a micropore size of<br>
about 1nm were used.<br>
[119]	Table 1 below provides results of the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
separators in Example 1 having a coating layer of a uniform thickness and in<br>
Comparative Examples 1-3. As can be seen in Table 1, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator in Example 1 had a half weight per unit area compared<br>
with that of the organic/inorganic composite porous separator using non-porous<br>
inorganic particles in Comparative Example 1, but had a high porosity and thus, high<br>
ion conductivity (see Table 1 for reference). Particularly, the organic/inorganic<br>
composite porous separator in Example 1 had higher values both in pore size and in<br>
porosity, compared with Comparative Example 3 having a micropore size of about<br>
lnm, demonstrating its high ion conductivity (see Table 1 for reference).<br>
[120]	Table 1<br><br>
[121]	2-3. Analysis of correlation between inorganic porous particles and organic/<br>
inorganic composite porous separator<br>
[122]	The sample used in this test: was the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
obtained by coating the porous Al2O3 /PVdF-CTFE onto the polyethylene film obtained<br>
according to Example 1.<br>
[123]	The analysis results of physical properties, such as loading amount, permeability,<br><br>
and porosity, of the organic/inorganic composite porous separator by inorganic porous<br>
particle contents show that the weight of the organic/inorganic composite separator<br>
decreased as the content of the inorganic porous particles present in the coating layer<br>
increased (see FIG. 9 for reference). Moreover, as the content of inorganic porous<br>
particles increased, the porosity of the organic/inorganic composite porous separator<br>
was increased while the permeability (i.e., air permeability) was decreased (see FIGs. 9<br>
and 10 for reference).<br>
[124]	Experimental Example 3. Evaluation of performance of lithium<br>
secondary battery<br>
[125]	The following test was performed to evaluate C-rate of a lithium secondary battery<br>
comprising the organic/inorganic composite porous separator according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[126]	lithium secondary batteries according to Examples 1-3 were used as samples. As<br>
controls, used were the battery comprising the organic/inorganic composite separator<br>
that is obtained by using non-porous inorganic particles according to Comparative<br>
Example 1, the battery using a commercial PE separator according to Comparative<br>
Example 2, and the battery comprising the organic/inorganic composite separator that<br>
is obtained by using zeolite having a micropore size of about 1nm according to<br>
Comparative Example 3, respectively. Each battery having a capacity of 760 mAh was<br>
subjected to cycling at a discharge rate of 0.5C, 1C and 2C. The following Table 2<br>
shows the discharge capacity of each battery, the capacity being expressed on the C-<br>
Rate basis.<br>
[127]	According to the test results, each of lithium secondary batteries according to<br>
Examples 1 to 3 shows high C-rate characteristics comparable to those of the battery<br>
according to Comparative Examples 1 and 3. In addition, as shown in Table 2, the<br>
capacity at a rate of up to 2C is equal to the high C-rate discharge characteristics of the<br>
conventional polyolefin-based separator.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[129] As can be seen from the foregoing, the organic/inorganic composite porous<br>
[128]	Table 2<br><br>
separator of the present invention comprises inorganic porous particles as a component<br>
of the organic/inorganic composite layer, so that an additional pathway for lithium ions<br>
can be created due to a number of pores existing in the inorganic porous particle itself.<br>
In this manner, degradation in the battery performance can be minimized, while energy<br>
density per unit weight can be increased by the weight loss effect.<br>
