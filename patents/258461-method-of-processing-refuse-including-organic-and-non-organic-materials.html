The present invention relates to a refuse processing method.<br>
There is known from the document WO 01/85646 a refuse processing method of the type in which the refuse is admixed with quicklime and a strongly slaked substance such as purification station sludge and/or grease, the chemical reaction is allowed to take place in this mixture for a certain time, and the deslaked product resulting from this reaction is then ground.<br>
In the above prior art process, there is provision for extracting from the refuse, prior to the admixture of the refuse with the quicklime and the strongly slaked substances, non-organic materials that could not be extracted therefrom subsequently by aeraulic means (cyclones, etc.). These non-organic materials extracted beforehand include ferrous and non-ferrous metals, glass, etc.<br>
This extraction beforehand, effected by standard sorting means, is nevertheless often difficult.<br>
It has become clear in fact that the non-organic materials from such refuse tend to bond to the organic materials, thereby making it difficult to separate these two categories of materials.<br>
One object of the present invention is to eliminate this problem.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved with a method of processing refuse including organic and non-organic materials, noteworthy in that it comprises the steps of:<br>
A)	admixing quicklime and a highly slaked substance with said refuse,<br>
B)	allowing said organic materials to react to give a product that includes a calcium organic complex and said non-organic materials, and<br>
C)	separating said non-organic materials from said calcium organic complex.<br>
The reaction that occurs between the organic materials from the refuse, the quicklime and the strongly slaked substance dehydrates the organic material and thereby produces a product in which the non-organic materials (which have not reacted) are easily separated from the remainder of the product, i.e. from the calcium organic complex.<br>
Thus it is a very simple matter to separate these non-organic materials from the calcium organic complex by conventional means.<br>
According to further, optional features of the method of the invention:<br>
- the method includes the step D) of sorting the non-organic materials obtained at the end of the step C),<br><br>
-	the method comprises the step 0) of dividing said refuse in accordance with a predetermined particle size range prior to the step A),<br>
-	at least a portion of said calcium organic complex obtained at the end of the step C) is re-injected into the mixture of the step A),<br>
-	the method comprises the step E) of screening said calcium organic complex according to a predetermined particle size range,<br>
-	the strongly slaked substance is a substance selected from the group comprising purification station sludges and greases,<br>
-	at least one compound selected from the group comprising green refuse, cellulose-based materials, slurry, droppings, peat is added to the mixture of the step A),<br>
-	a confinement area having a moving bottom is used to implement the step B),<br>
-	a static confinement area is used to implement the step B),<br>
-	separation and sorting means for implementing the steps C) and/or D) and/or E) are selected from the group comprising screening means, magnetic means, Eddy current means and gravity means.<br>
The present invention also relates to an installation for implementing a method according to any one of the preceding claims, noteworthy in that it comprises, in this order from the entry point of the refuse to be processed:<br>
-	means for mixing said refuse with said quicklime and said strongly slaked substance,<br>
-	means for allowing said reaction to take place, and<br>
-	means for separating said non-organic materials from said calcium organic complex.<br>
According to further, optional features of the installation:<br>
-	the installation further comprises means for sorting the non-organic materials obtained at the end of the step C),<br>
-	the installation comprises, upstream of said mixing means, means for dividing said refuse according to a predetermined particle size range,<br>
-	the installation comprises, downstream of said extraction means, means for screening said fraction in accordance with a predetermined particle size range,<br>
-	said means for allowing said reaction to take place comprise a moving bottom confinement area,<br>
-	said means for allowing said reaction to take place comprise a static<br><br>
confinement area.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent on reading the following description and examining the appended single figure, which is a diagram representing the main steps of the method of the invention.<br>
According to the preamble of the present description, in everything hereinafter (description and claims), the expression "non-organic materials" refers specifically to non-organic materials that cannot be extracted from the refuse by aeraulic means (cycloning, etc.) following the chemical reaction with the lime.<br>
Those non-organic materials comprise in particular ferrous and non-ferrous metals, glass, etc.<br>
The refuse to be processed is preferably domestic refuse, which generally arrives at the processing site in plastic sacks tipped into a receiving area.<br>
This kind of receiving area may typically comprise a plurality of metal casings with moving bottoms operating in accordance with the FIFO (first in, first out) principle.<br>
This refuse typically comprises organic materials and non-organic materials.<br>
A start is preferably made, in the step 0, by shearing and/or grinding and/or lacerating the sacks of refuse to obtain fragments having a predetermined particle size range (typically of the order of 80 to 100 mm).<br>
In the step A, the quicklime (CaO) and a strongly slaked substance is mixed with the refuse.<br>
For example, the strongly slaked substance may consist of purification station sludge and/or grease.<br>
The mixing operation may be effected by any appropriate device known to the person skilled in the art, for example of the type comprising a lead screw turning inside a mixing tank.<br>
In the step B, the chemical reaction between the refuse, the quicklime and the strongly slaked product is allowed to occur.<br>
As is known in the art, this chemical reaction may be written as follows:<br>
Organic materials + CaO + H20 -» calcium organic complex + C02 + H20 (steam) + other gases (NH3, NH4, etc.).<br>
This strongly exothermic reaction may take place within a static confinement area, such as a ditch or a closed casing.<br>
However, apparatus with a moving bottom of the type described in the<br><br>
application PCT/FR00/01250, published 15 November 2001 under the number WO 01/85645, is preferably used.<br>
The time necessary for the chemical reaction mentioned above to take place exceeds 30 minutes and is generally from two to four hours.<br>
After the step B, a product is obtained whose moisture content has been greatly reduced, i.e. a product having a dry appearance.<br>
This product comprises on the one hand a calcium organic complex resulting from said chemical reaction and on the other hand said non-organic materials which have remained inert in relation to this chemical reaction.<br>
Because of the low moisture content of the product obtained after the step B, it is a very simple matter to separate the non-organic materials (ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals, glass, etc.) from the calcium organic complex during the step C and to sort these non-organic materials during the step D.<br>
The means used to separate the non-organic materials from the calcium organic complex and for sorting the non-organic materials are conventional and may typically comprise:<br>
-	screening means,<br>
-	magnetic means (of the overband type) for extracting ferrous metals,<br>
-	Eddy current means for extracting non-ferrous metals,<br>
-gravity means (of the vibrating table type) for separating the heaviest elements from the lightest elements, etc.<br>
In the step E, the calcium organic complex is screened to obtain a powder product typically having a particle size range from 0 to 20 mm or more if necessary.<br>
There is obtained in this way a product that may be suitable in particular for organic calcium-rich soil improvers for use in agriculture.<br>
It will be noted that provision may be made for adding to the mixture of the step A other carbon-containing compounds, such as green refuse (for example grass clippings), cellulose-based materials (paper, cardboard), slurry, droppings, peat, etc.<br>
It will also be noted that at least a portion of the calcium organic complex may be re-injected into the mixture of the step A (see reference 1 in the appended figure).<br>
This operation adapts the relative proportions of organic materials and quicklime in the mixture of the step A and thus produces in the end a product that always has substantially the same composition.<br>
In this way it is possible to comply with invariance constraints imposed by<br><br>
applicable regulations.<br>
By way of illustrative and nonlimiting example, the proportions by weight of the various constituents of the chemical reaction mentioned above are as follows:<br>
-	materials constituting the refuse: from 20 to 70%,<br>
-	quicklime from 10 to 30%,<br>
-	strongly slaked substance (water where applicable charged with organic materials) from 10 to 60%.<br>
As is clear in the light of the foregoing description, by dehydrating all the refuse, the invention makes it very easy to separate non-organic materials from organic materials.<br>
The invention also facilitates sorting these non-organic materials from each other, given that after the step B the non-organic materials have been rendered hygienic, i.e. they no longer contain any pathogens and/or putrid substances.<br>
Because these non-organic materials no longer represent a hazard to humans at the end of step B, manual sorting may even be envisaged.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment described, which is provided by way of purely illustrative example.<br><br>
