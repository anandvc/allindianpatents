				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING (METH)ACRYLIC ACID<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a (meth)acrylic acid compound, particularly to<br>
a process for producing (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic<br>
acid, which comprises reacting propylene, propane or<br>
isobutylene by catalytic vapor phase oxidation in an<br>
oxidation reactor, wherein deterioration of the catalytic<br>
activity or the useful catalyst life is prevented,<br>
thereby to produce the (meth)acrylic acid compound<br>
constantly and efficiently.<br>
In the present invention, the (meth)acrylic acid<br>
compound means (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic acid, the<br>
(meth)acrolein means acrolein or methacrolein, and the<br>
(meth)acrylic acid means acrylic acid or methacrylic<br>
acid.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a reaction for producing (meth)acrylic acid,<br>
there is a catalytic vapor phase oxidation method of<br>
propylene, propane or isobutylene. In the method for<br>
obtaining (meth)acrylic acid by catalytic vapor phase<br>
oxidation of propylene, propane or isobutylene,<br>
conditions for oxidation to (meth)acrolein and for<br>
oxidation to (meth)acrylic acid in the next step are<br>
different. Accordingly, there are a two step oxidation<br>
process in which the respective oxidation reactions are<br>
carried out by different catalysts or in separate<br>
reactors, and a process in which plural types of<br>
catalysts are packed in one reactor to carry out the<br>
oxidation reactions in the single reactor. In such a<br>
step for producing (meth)acrolein by catalytic vapor<br>
phase oxidation of propylene, propane or isobutylene by<br>
using a molecular oxygen and/or a step for producing<br>
(meth)acrylic acid by catalytic vapor phase oxidation of<br>
(meth)acrolein by using the molecular oxygen (hereinafter<br>
sometimes referred to as "process for producing a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid compound"), in order to adjust the<br>
catalytic activity and to prevent the formation of<br>
detonating gas, gaseous water (steam) is mixed to a gas<br>
comprising a combustible, gas such as propylene and<br>
molecular oxygen to obtain a raw material mixed gas.<br>
Fig. 1 is an example of a flow chart for producing<br>
acrylic acid by two step oxidation, wherein propylene<br>
with steam and air is oxidized in two steps via a first<br>
reactor and a second reactor having a molybdenum type<br>
catalyst or the like packed, to form an acrylic acid-<br>
containing gas. Such an acrylic acid-containing gas is<br>
contacted with water in a condensation column (quench<br>
column) to obtain an aqueous acrylic acid solution, which<br>
is extracted by adding a suitable extraction solvent, in<br>
an extraction column, whereupon the extraction solvent is<br>
separated in a solvent separation column. Then, acetic<br>
acid is separated in an acetic acid separation column to<br>
obtain a crude acrylic acid, and further, from the crude<br>
acrylic acid, byproducts are separated in a fractionating<br>
column to obtain a purified product of acrylic acid.<br>
Further, in recent years, instead of the above<br>
solvent extraction method wherein recovery of acrylic<br>
acid from the aqueous acrylic acid solution is carried<br>
out by means of an extraction solvent, an azeotropic<br>
separation method is also employed wherein distillation<br>
is carried out by using water and an azeotropic solvent,<br>
so that from the top of an azeotropic separation column,<br>
an azeotropic mixture comprising water and the azeotropic<br>
solvent, is distilled, and from the bottom, acrylic acid<br>
is recovered.<br>
In a case where methacrylic acid is produced by a<br>
catalytic vapor phase oxidation method, isobutylene is<br>
subjected to vapor phase oxidation. In the case of the<br>
two step oxidation method, isobutylene is oxidized to<br>
methacrylic acid via methacrolein.<br>
In the process for producing a (meth)acrylic acid<br>
compound, the composition of a raw material mixed gas<br>
comprising a combustible gas such as propylene, molecular<br>
oxygen and gaseous water, may change to decrease the<br>
yield of the desired product, or the temperature of the<br>
catalyst layers may abruptly increase to form hot spots,<br>
thus leading to deterioration in the performance of the<br>
catalyst or to a damage of the production apparatus.<br>
JP-A-5-229984 discloses a method for producing<br>
acrylic acid by oxidizing acrolein, wherein the raw<br>
material acrolein is preheated to increase the<br>
selectivity for acrylic acid. Further, JP-A-2000-53610<br>
discloses the ratio in a raw material mixed gas and the<br>
raw material.mixed gas temperature at the reactor inlet<br>
to improve the yield of acrylic acid. However, such<br>
methods had a problem of deterioration of the catalytic<br>
activity or the useful life of the catalyst.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a process for producing (meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic<br>
acid, which comprises reacting propylene, propane or<br>
isobutylene by catalytic vapor phase oxidation in an<br>
oxidation reactor, wherein the change of the composition<br>
of the raw material mixed gas, the abnormal temperature<br>
increase in the oxidation reactor, and the deterioration<br>
of the catalytic activity or the useful catalyst life is<br>
prevented to produce the (meth)acrylic acid compound<br>
constantly and efficiently.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process for producing a (meth)acrylic acid<br>
compound of the present invention is a process for<br>
producing a (meth)acrylic acid compound, which comprises<br>
reacting a raw material mixed gas by catalytic vapor<br>
phase oxidation in an oxidation reactor to produce<br>
(meth)acrolein or (meth)acrylic acid, characterized in<br>
that the temperature of the raw material mixed gas<br>
introduced into the oxidation reactor is maintained to be<br>
at least the dew point temperature of the raw material<br>
mixed gas.<br>
Heretofore, water in liquid state formed by<br>
condensation of gaseous water contained in the raw<br>
material mixed gas, is in contact with a catalyst,<br>
whereby the activity or the useful life of the catalyst<br>
is deteriorated. Further, by the formation of such<br>
liquid state water, the composition of the raw material<br>
mixed gas supplied, will be changed, whereby hot spots<br>
will be formed, thus leading to problems such as<br>
deterioration of the yield of the desired product,<br>
deterioration of the catalytic performance, and damage of<br>
the production apparatus, due to the abnormal temperature<br>
increase.<br>
In the present invention, by maintaining the<br>
temperature of the raw material mixed gas introduced into<br>
the oxidation reactor to be at least the dew point<br>
temperature of the raw material mixed gas, the raw<br>
material mixed gas not containing liquid state water is<br>
introduced into the oxidation reactor, whereby the above<br>
problems caused by the liquid state water in the raw<br>
material mixed gas are solved.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferred that the<br>
conduit for supplying the raw material mixed gas from a<br>
raw material mixer to the oxidation reactor is heated<br>
and/or kept warm, to control the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas. Further, the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas introduced into the oxidation reactor<br>
is preferably at most 260°C.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1: A flow sheet which shows one example of the<br>
production process of acrylic acid.<br>
MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, a mode for carrying out of the process for<br>
producing a (meth)acrylic acid compound of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail.<br>
The process of the present invention may be suitably<br>
applied particularly to a process for producing<br>
(meth)acrolein or a (meth)acrylic acid compound by<br>
oxidation of propylene, propane or isobutylene with a<br>
molecular oxygen-containing gas by using a multi-tubular<br>
reactor, or a process for producing (meth)acrylic acid by<br>
oxidation of (meth)acrolein with a molecular oxygen-<br>
containing gas by using a multi-tubular reactor.<br>
As mentioned above, propylene, propane or<br>
isobutylene is oxidized in two steps, in which<br>
(meth)acrylic acid is produced via (meth)acrolein.<br>
Accordingly, the production of (meth)acrylic acid from<br>
propylene, propane or isobutylene is carried out by using<br>
two multi-tubular reactors, as shown in Fig. 1. The<br>
reaction may be carried out by packing different<br>
catalysts in the respective reactors, or, a process for<br>
producing (meth)acrylic acid may be employed in which the<br>
shell side of a single reactor is divided into at least 2<br>
reaction compartments by a middle-tube plate and<br>
different catalysts are packed in the respective<br>
compartments. Thus, the present invention may be applied<br>
to either process.<br>
The catalyst to be used for producing (meth)acrylic<br>
acid is not particularly limited, but a molybdenum type<br>
multi-component composite metal oxide which is commonly<br>
used, is preferred.<br>
To the oxidation reactor such as a multi-tubular<br>
reactor, a raw material mixed gas is introduced, which<br>
comprises propylene, propane or isobutylene, steam and<br>
molecular oxygen and which is adjusted by a component<br>
inert to a reaction such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide.<br>
Such a raw material mixed gas is prepared by mixing a raw<br>
material such as propylene, water, air, etc. in a raw<br>
material mixer provided at a stage prior to the oxidation<br>
reactor.<br>
In the present invention, for example, the conduit<br>
for supplying the raw material mixed gas from such a raw<br>
material mixer to the oxidation reactor, is covered with<br>
a heat insulating material, or kept warm by a trace using<br>
a high temperature fluid such as steam or hot water, or<br>
the raw material mixed gas to be supplied to the<br>
oxidation reactor is heated by a heater provided between<br>
the raw material mixer and the oxidation reactor. Thus,<br>
the temperature of the raw material mixed gas introduced<br>
into the oxidation reactor is maintained to be at least<br>
the dew point temperature of the raw material mixed gas.<br>
In order to maintain the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas introduced to the oxidation reactor to<br>
be at least the dew point temperature by keeping warm<br>
and/or heating in such a manner, the following method<br>
may, for example, be employed. A thermometer and a<br>
pressure gauge are provided at the upstream side of the<br>
inlet of the oxidation reactor, and the dew point of the<br>
raw material mixed gas is obtained by calculation from<br>
the composition and the pressure of the raw material<br>
mixed gas. The temperatures of the respective raw<br>
material components supplied to the raw material mixed<br>
gas and/or the heating temperature by the heater (the<br>
outlet temperature of the heater) may be controlled so<br>
that the value measured by the thermometer provided at<br>
the upstream side of the inlet of the oxidation reactor<br>
will be at least the dew point temperature calculated as<br>
mentioned above.<br>
By thus maintaining the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas introduced to the oxidation reactor to<br>
be at least the dew point temperature, the composition of<br>
the raw material mixed gas will not deviate from the set<br>
value, and the raw material mixed gas of the prescribed<br>
composition will be introduced to the catalyst layers of<br>
the oxidation reactor. Further, the temperature increase<br>
to form hot spots of the catalyst layers is also<br>
prevented, whereby it becomes possible to obtain the<br>
desired product in high yield.<br>
Now, an example of the method for calculating the<br>
dew point of the raw material mixed gas is shown. For<br>
example, if propylene at 45°C: 10 vol%, air at 100°C: 75<br>
vol%, a heated water vapor (steam) at 132°C: 10 vol%, and<br>
nitrogen at 20°C: 5 vol% are mixed to obtain a raw<br>
material mixed gas having a pressure of P=17 0 kPa, the<br>
dew point t will be 56.6°C by an Antoine formula of<br>
log10P [kPa] = 7.074-1657/(227.0 + t(°C)).<br>
In the present invention, the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas to be introduced to the oxidation<br>
reactor, which is maintained by keeping warm and/or<br>
heating the raw material mixed gas supplied from the raw<br>
material mixer to the oxidation reactor, may vary<br>
depending on the dew point of the raw material mixed gas,<br>
namely, the composition or the pressure. However, in a<br>
usual case, the lower limit of such temperature is<br>
preferably 60°C, more preferably 80°C. Further, the<br>
upper limit temperature of the raw material mixed gas is<br>
preferably 260°C, more preferably 240°C, furthermore<br>
preferably 220°C. Particularly, the temperature of the<br>
raw material mixed gas to be introduced to the oxidation<br>
reactor is preferably a temperature higher by from 5 to<br>
25°C than the dew point temperature of the raw material<br>
mixed gas.<br>
By selecting the above preferred temperature range,<br>
abnormal deterioration of the catalytic activity of the<br>
catalysts in the oxidation reactor can be prevented, and<br>
the abnormal increase of the temperature can be<br>
prevented, whereby it is possible to produce a<br>
(meth)acrylic acid compound constantly and efficiently.<br>
Further, in the present invention, it is possible to<br>
produce a (meth)acrylic acid compound in accordance with<br>
a usual manner, except that the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas to be introduced to the oxidation<br>
reactor is maintained to be at least the dew point<br>
temperature of the raw material mixed gas by keeping warm<br>
and/or heating the raw material mixed gas supplied from<br>
the raw material mixer to the oxidation reactor. For<br>
example, usual conditions may be employed with respect to<br>
the composition of the raw material mixed gas or the<br>
reaction conditions in the oxidation reactor.<br>
In general, the composition of the raw material<br>
mixed gas, may properly be set within such a range that<br>
the material such as propylene, propane or isobutylene is<br>
from 5 to 13 vol%, air is from 37 to 87 vol%, steam is<br>
from 3 to 26 vol%, and nitrogen is from 0 to 55 vol%.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
To carry out the oxidation reaction of propylene, as<br>
the earlier stage catalyst, a catalyst powder having a<br>
composition of Mo12Bi5Ni3Co2Feo.4Nao.2Bo.4Ko.1Si240x (the<br>
composition x of oxygen is a value defined by the<br>
oxidation conditions of the respective metals) was<br>
produced. The catalyst powder was formed into a ring<br>
catalyst having an outer diameter of 5 mmcp, an inner<br>
diameter of 2 mmcp and a height of 4 mm. As a reactor, a<br>
multi-tubular reactor was used, which had stainless steel<br>
reaction tubes with a length of 3.5 m, an inner diameter<br>
of 24 mmcp and an outer diameter of 28 mmco. and which had<br>
a shell inner diameter of 1(50 mmcp. ) As a heating medium,<br>
a molten-salt Niter of a nitrate mixture was used, and it<br>
was supplied from the top of the reactor. As the<br>
reaction temperature, the temperature of the Niter as the<br>
heating medium supplied to the reactor was adopted.<br>
1.5 Liters of the earlier stage ring catalyst was<br>
packed in the respective reaction tubes, and the raw<br>
material mixed gas was supplied at 170 kPa (kilopascal)<br>
from the top of the reactor.<br>
As the raw material mixed gas, a mixture obtained by<br>
mixing propylene, air, steam and nitrogen in proportions<br>
of 10 vol%, 75 vol%, 10 vol% and 5 vol%, respectively,<br>
was used. The dew point of this raw material mixed gas<br>
was 56.6°C.<br>
The conduit between the mixer for the raw material<br>
mixed gas and the reactor was traced by low-pressure<br>
steam and covered with a heat insulating material to keep<br>
it warm. Further, a thermocouple and a pressure gauge<br>
were provided at the inlet portion of the reactor, and<br>
the dew point of the raw material mixed gas was<br>
calculated and monitored all the time by using a<br>
computer. At the same time, by means of a heater<br>
provided between the mixer and the reactor, the<br>
temperature of the raw material mixed gas at the inlet of<br>
the reactor was controlled to be at least the dew point<br>
temperature by a temperature regulator, and the operation<br>
was carried out so that the temperature of the raw<br>
material mixed gas measured by the thermocouple provided<br>
at the inlet portion of the reactor was constant: at 80°C.<br>
Further, the temperature distribution was measured<br>
by inserting in the reaction tube of the reactor, a<br>
thermometer having ten measurement points in the tube<br>
axis direction.<br>
The temperature of the heating medium was set at<br>
33 0°C, and the operation was carried out for one week,<br>
whereby the conversion of propylene was 97%, the yield of<br>
acrolein was 92%, and the maximum temperature in the<br>
reaction catalyst layers was 400°C. The operation was<br>
carried out for one month from the initiation of the<br>
operation while the temperature of the heating medium was<br>
maintained to be 330°C, whereby upon expiration of the<br>
one month, the conversion of propylene was 96.8%, the<br>
yield of acrolein was 91.9%, and the maximum temperature<br>
in the reaction catalyst layers was 385°C<br>
During the period, the indicated temperature of the<br>
thermocouple provided at the inlet of the reactor was<br>
constant at 80°C. Further, the composition of the raw<br>
material mixed gas at the inlet of the reactor was<br>
analyzed by gas chromatography and the measured values<br>
were equal to the set values.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
The operation was carried out in the same manner as<br>
in Example 1 except that the steam for the trace was<br>
stopped, the heat insulating material was removed, and<br>
the temperature control of the heater was cancelled.<br>
The temperature of the heating medium was set at<br>
330°C, and the operation was carried out for a week,<br>
whereby the conversion of propylene was 97%, the yield of<br>
acrolein was 91%, and the hot spot temperature of the<br>
reaction catalyst layers was 410°C. While the<br>
temperature of the heating medium was maintained to be<br>
330°C, the operation was carried out for one month from<br>
the initiation of the operation, whereby the conversion<br>
of propylene was 95.8%, the yield of acrolein was 89.5%,<br>
and the hot spot temperature of the reaction catalyst<br>
layers was 400°C.<br>
During the period, the indicated temperature of the<br>
thermocouple provided at the inlet of the reactor was<br>
from 40 to 42°C. Further, the composition of the raw<br>
material mixed gas at the inlet of the reactor was<br>
analyzed by the gas chromatography, whereby propylene was<br>
10.6 vol%, air was 74.4 vol%, water was 4.4 vol%, and<br>
nitrogen was 10.6 vol%.<br>
The operation was suspended, and the apparatus was<br>
dismantled for inspection, whereby residual water was<br>
observed in the conduit.<br>
