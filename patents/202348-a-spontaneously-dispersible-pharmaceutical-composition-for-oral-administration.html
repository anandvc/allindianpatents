				<td>The present invention relates to a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for oral administration in which the active agent is N-benzoyl-staurosporine as disclosed e.g. in US 5,093,330 and equivalents thereof.<br>
US 5,093,330 specifically discloses two tablet formulations based on starch/lactose mixtures in the presence of colloidal silica, talc and magnesium stearate (Examples 52 and 53) and a capsule formulation based on talc and colloidal silica (Example 54). We have found that N-benzoyl-staurosporine presents highly specific difficulties in relation to administration generally and pharmaceutical compositions in particular, including problems with drug bioavailability and variability in inter- and intra-patient dose response, e.g. with respect to US 5,093,330. We have found it to be very lipophilic and practically insoluble in water, in simulated gastric and in intestinal fluids (solubility 
In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that stable pharmaceutical compositions with N-benzoyl-staurosporine having particularly interesting bioavailability characteristics and reduced variability in inter- and intra-subject bioavailability parameters, e.g. with respect to US 5,093,330, are obtainable. These novel N-benzoyl-staurosporine compositions have been found to meet or substantially reduce the difficulties encountered previously. It has been shown that the compositions in accordance with the present invention may enable effective N-benzoyl-staurosporine dosaging with concomitant enhancement as well as reduced variability of resorption/bioavailability levels for and between individual patients. Such reductions in variability in inter- and intra-subject bioavailability may be particularly found with respect to the specific formulations described. More particularly, it has been found that these compositions may contain solubilized N-benzoyl-staurosporine in sufficiently high concentration to permit convenient oral administration without exhibiting precipitation of the active agent. Thus, the invention may achieve effective therapy with lower N-benzoyl-staurosporine dosage levels and may permit closer  standardization    and   optimization    of   daily  dosage   requirements   for<br><br><br>
each individual. Consequently, occurrence of undesirable side-effects is diminished and overall cost of therapy may be reduced.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoylstaurosporine having a high level of bioavailability, e.g. as determined by measuring plasma concentrations over time, as defined by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in units of mass-time/volume.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoylstaurosporine having a reduced variability of bioavailability. In preferred embodiments variability of bioavailability is reduced by providing N-benzoylstaurosporine in form of a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for enteral, e.g. oral, administration comprising N-benzoyl-staurosporine. for example in the form of a micellar pregursor.<br>
The term spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition as used herein is defined as a system that is capable of producing colloidal structures, e.g. colloids or analogous structures, e.g. droplets, particles, micelles, e.g. swollen micelles, microemulsions and/or aggregates, of e.g. up to 1000 nm, e.g generally more than 5 nm, when diluted with an aqueous medium.   Such systems may be defined as consisting of one component or phase (the dispersed component or phase) finely divided and distributed throughout a second component or phase (the dispersion medium or contiuous component or phase), e.g. systems ranging from molecularly dispersed solutions wherein the mean size of the dispersed component or phase may be e.g. less than 200 nm, e.g. more than 5 nm, to macroemulsions wherein the mean size of the dispersed component or phase may be of e.g. up to 1000 nm, e.g. more than 200 nm. The aqueous medium may be for example water, for example on dilution of e.g. 1:10, or gastric juices, e.g. simulated conditions after oral application. The colloidal structures, e.g. colloids or analogous structures, e.g. droplets, particles and/or micelles, are formed spontaneously or substantially spontaneously when the<br><br>
components of the dispersible pharmaceutical composition are brought into contact with an aqueous medium, e.g. by simple shaking by hand for a short period of time, for example for 10 seconds. Such spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical compositions are thermodynamically stable, e.g. from at least 15 minutes or 4 hours to 24 hours. Typically, they contain dispersed, e.g. colloidal structures, e.g. colloids or analogous structures, of a size less than about 200 nm as measured by standard light scattering techniques, e.g. using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000, preferably they comprise droplets or particles having a mean diameter of less than about 150 nm, typically less than 100 nm, generally greater than 5 nm. The micellar compositions or the micellar part of such spontaneously dispersible compositions may be monophasic and substantially non-opaque, i.e. transparent or opalescent when viewed by optical microscopic means.<br>
Alternatively, the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition may form simultaneously a mixture comprising aqueous micelles and nanoparticles. Such nanoparticles may have a particle size of from 150 nm to about 1000 nm, generally in the range of 200 to 800 nm. It was found that the amount of nanoparticles produced may be temperature dependent but still adequate bioavailability characteristics may be obtained.<br>
Although the invention has been described particularly with respect to a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition a man skilled in the art will appreciate that other systems may be prepared.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising<br>
1)	N-benzoyl-staurosporine,<br>
2)	a hydrophilic component, and<br>
3)	a surfactant.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention provides a method of increasing bioavailability of N-benzoylstaurosporine by mixing N-benzoylstaurosporine with a carrier comprising a hydrophilic component, and a surfactant.<br><br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for increasing the bioavailability of N-benzoylstaurosporine which comprises<br>
1)	N-benzoyl-staurosporme,<br>
2)	a hydrophilic component, and 2) a surfactant.<br>
The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition (hereinafter embraced by the term pharmaceutical composition of the present invention) is preferably in the form of a colloidal structures, e.g. colloids or analogous structures, e.g. a micellar precursor. N-benzoyl-staurosporine is hereinafter also referred to as the active agent and all other components of the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition may be heremafter referred to as the carrier of the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition. The components of the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical compositions may be described in Fiedler, H. P. "Lexikon der Hilfsstoffe fur Pharmazie, Kosmetik und angrenzende Gebiete", Editio Cantor, D-7960 Aulendorf, 4th revised and expanded edition (1996), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In accordance with the present invention N-benzoyl-staurosporine may be present in an amount by weight of up to about 20% by weight of the composition. Preferably the active agent is present in an amount of 1 to 15% by weight of the composition, for example about 5 to 10%, and more preferred 5%.<br>
The hydrophilic component preferably provides for fast mixing of the active agent with water on admixture with water and may be determined by routine experimentation, for example by various chromatography methods, e.g. Gas Chromatography (GC). The hydrophilic component may comprise a main or sole conponent, e.g. an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or alternatively may comprise a co-component which may be selected from partial ethers or lower alkanols. Preferred lower alkanol components include ethanol, 1,2-propylene glycol or a polyethylene glycol, e.g. of a molecular weight of 100 to 600 daltons, e.g. polyethylene glycol 4(X). When present in the invention ethanol may comprise up to 60 % by weight of the hydrophilic component; preferably 20 to about 55% by weight, more<br><br>
preferably about 25 to about 40 % by weight. Especially preferred partial ethers are those known and commercially available as for example glycofurol (also known as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether). These co-components when present are e.g. a partial replacement of other components of the hydrophilic component such that the efficacy of the hydrophilic component as part of the N-benzoyl-staurosporine carrier is not materially impaired. The hydrophilic component may further comprise triethylcitrate, Transcutol, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylisosorbide, or propylene carbonate.<br>
The total amount of the hydrophilic component present in the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise 5 to 50% by weight of the carrier, e.g. 10 to 50%; preferably 10 to 40% by weight, more preferably about 15 to 35 % by weight.<br>

Surfactants useful for the present invention may be of the anionic, cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic type or mixtures thereof and have generally a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value of from about 3 to 20. Usually nonionic surfactants are preferred, particularly those non-ionic surfactants that have an HLB value of greater than 10, e.g. 14 to 20. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may embrace systems comprising a mixture of surfactants, e.g. a mixture of a first surfactant and one or more co-surfactants selected from any of the surfactant types listed below. Especially preferred are specific combinations of a surfactant having a high HLB value with a co-surfactant having a low HLB value, for example a combination of a polyoxyethylene castor oil derivative, e.g. Cremophor RH 40 (HLB 14-16) and a transesterified ethoxylated vegetable oil, e.g. Labrafil M2125 CS (HLB 3-4).<br>

Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoyl-staurosporine and a surfactant having a HLB value of greater than 10 and a fatty acid glyceride as a lipophilic component.<br><br>
The total amount of lipophilic component when present in the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical compositions may comprise 5 to 85 % by weight of the carrier, e.g. 10 to 85%; preferably 15 to 70 % by weight, more preferably about 20 to about 50 % by weight.<br>
Accordingly, in yet another aspect the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoyl-staurosporine, a surfactant selected from the group consisting of a polyoxyethylene castor oil, e.g. Cremophor RH 40, a polyoxyethylene alkcyl ether, e.g. Brij 35, and a polysorbate, e.g. Tween 20, and a lipophilic component selected from the group consisting of a fatty acid glycerides, for example a fractionated coconut oil, e.g. Miglyol 810 and 812, a com oil glyceride, and a acetylated mono- or diglyceride, respectively.<br>
Such spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in a conventional manner and may preferably be in a form of a micellar precursor as described above.<br>
Where desired, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise further additives or ingredients, for example thickening agents, suspending agents, solidifying agents, as well as antioxidants, e.g. tocopherols, ascorbyl palmitate, butyl hydroxy anisole (BHA), butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT), antimicrobial agents, enzyme inhibitors, stabilizers, preserving agents, and the like. The total amount of these additives or ingredients when present in the invention may comprise about 0.05 to 5 %, preferably 0.1 to 1%, by weight of the total weight of the spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition. The spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition may also include sweetening or flavoring agents in an amount of up to about 2.5 or 5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Thus in yet another aspect, the present invention provides a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising<br>
(a)	up to 20% by weight of N-benzoyl-staurosporine,<br>
(b)	5 to 50% by weight of a hydrophilic component.<br><br>
(c)	5 to 80% by weight of a surfactant or surfactant mixture,<br>
(d)	5 to 85% by weight of a lipophilic component, and<br>
(e)	0.05 to 5 % by weight of an additive.<br>
Naturally, any pharmaceutical composition of the present invention as described above in form of a micellar precursor can itself, i.e. before dilution with an aqueous medium, or after dilution with an aqueous medium, be present in the form of a an aqueous micellar solution (possibly comprising nanoparticles), an oily or aqueous emulsion, preferably a microemulsion, and accordingly exhibit the structural features characteristic of such systems.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations, e.g. those in the examples hereinafter, may show good stability characteristics as indicated by standard stability trials, for example having a shelf life stability of up to one, two or three years, and even longer. The pharmaceutical formulations of this invention produce aqueous microemulsions or aqueous micelles which are stable for up to one day or longer.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention exhibit especially advantageous properties when administered orally. For example in terms of reduced variability and high<br>
  level of bioavailability, e.g. obtained in standard bioavailability trials, e.g. by measuring the area under the plasma concentration(AUC)-time curve from e.g. 0 to 48 h, in units of mass-time/volume and Cmax average, defined as highest observed concentration in plasma in units mass/volume. Such biopharmaceutical properties of the compositions of the invention, e.g. the compositions of the Examples, may be determined in conventional manner, e.g. in<br>
  standard animal tests, e.g. in rats or dogs, e.g. beagle dogs, or clinical trials. Typically, fasted beagle dogs, e.g. in groups of up to 8, e.g. 6 to 8, may be used and blood drug levels detected, e.g. using an HPLC method with fluorescence detection or e.g. by ELIS A using a specific monoclonal antibody. Typically a dose of e.g. 25 mg or 50 mg, e.g. 50 mg, of active agent may be administered. For example, typical AUC/dose values in<br>
 (h-nmol/L)/(mg/kg) range from 960 to 1700 for Formulation A, from 380 to 1760 for Formulation B, and from 840 to 1970 for Formulation C. Typical Cmx/dose values in (nmol/L)/(mg/kg) range from 130 to 310 for Formulation A, from 60 to 280 for<br><br>
Formulation B, and from 140 to 310 for Formulation C.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoylstaurosporine having an AUC(0-48h)/dose value (in (h-nmo]/L)/(mg/kg)) upon administration of a dose (in mg/kg) to fasted beagle dogs of up to 2000, e.g. from 380 to 2000, e.g. from 840 to 2000.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoylstaurosporine having a Cmax/dose value (in (nmol/L)/(mg/kg)) upon administration of a dose (in mg/kg) to fasted beagle dogs of up to 310, e.g. from 60 to 310, e.g. from 140 to 310.<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters, for example absorption and blood levels, also become surprisingly more predictable and problems in administration with erratic absorption may be eliminated or reduced. It has been found that the compositions of this invention reduce variability in inter- and intra-patient dose response. Typically, the variabilty of bioavailability is about 10 % for Formulation A, about 17 % for Formulation B, and about 14 % for Formulation C.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration comprising N-benzoylstaurosporine and having a variability of bioavailability of N-benzoylstaurosporine of less than 20%, e.g. from 5 % to 17 %, e.g. from 10 % to 17<br>
%.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method of increasing bioavailability or reducing variability of bioavailability levels of N-benzoylstaurosporine, said method comprising orally administering a composition of the invention to fasted beagle dogs, e.g. wherein N-benzoylstaurosporine has an AUC(0-48h)/dose value (in (h»nmol/L)/(mg/kg)) upon administration of a dose (in mg/kg) to fasted beagle dogs of up to 2000, e.g. from 380 to 2000, e.g. from 840 to 2000.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method of increasing bioavailability or reducing<br><br>
variability of bioavailability levels of N-benzoylstaurosporine, said method comprising orally administering a composition of the invention to fasted beagle dogs, e.g. wherein N-benzoylstaurosporine has a Cmax/dose value (in (nmol/L)/(mg/kg)) upon administration of a dose (in mg/kg) to fasted beagle dogs of up to 310, e.g. from 60 to 310, e.g. from 140 to 310.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides a method of increasing bioavailability or reducmg variability of bioavailability levels of N-benzoylstaurosporine, said method comprising orally administering a composition of the invention to fasted beagle dogs, e.g. wherein the variability of bioavailability is less than 20%, e.g. from 5 % to 17 %, e.g. from 10 % to 17<br>
%.<br>
Additionally the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are effective with tenside materials, for example bile salts, being present in the gastro-intestinal tract. That is, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are spontaneously dispersible in aqueous systems comprising such natural tensides and thus capable of providing aqueous microemulsion or aqueous micellar systems in situ which are stable. The function of the pharmaceutical compositions in the present invention upon oral administration remain substantially independent of and/or unimpaired by the relative presence or absence of bile salts at any particular time or for any given individual.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of a spontaneously dispersible pharmaceutical composition as defined above, which process comprises bringing the hydrophilic component and the surfactant (and additional components if required) into intimate admixture, and adding the active agent, i.e. N-benzoyl-staurosporine. When required, the composition may be compounded into unit dosage form, for example by encapsulation into soft or hard gelatine capsules. Optionally further components or additives, in particular a hydrophilic co-component, for example ethanol, may be mixed with the two components or with or after addition of the active agent. For example, while I the use of ethanol in the compositions is not essential, ethanol may provide additional benefits, for example it has been found to be of particular advantage when the compositions are to be manufactured in soft gelatine, encapsulated form. This is because storage<br><br>
characteristics are improved, in particular the risk of active agent precipitation following encapsulation procedures is reduced. Thus the shelf life stability may be extended by employing ethanol or some other such co-component as an additional ingredient of the hydrophilic component.<br>
The utility of all the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be observed in standard clinical tests in, for example, known indications of active agent dosages giving equivalent blood levels of active agent; for example using dosages in the range from 25 mg to 300 mg, preferably from 100 to 225 mg, e.g. 120 to 225 mg, e.g. 150 mg of active agent per day for a 75 kilogram mammal, e.g. an adult human, and in standard animal models. The pharmaceutical profile, e.g. increased bioavailability and reduced variability of bioavailability, of the active agent provided by the compositions may be observed in standard animal tests and in clinical trials, e.g. as described above.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method of increasing bioavailability levels or reducing variability of bioavailability levels of N-benzoylstaurosporine for patients during N- benzoylstaurosporine therapy, said method comprising orally administering a composition of the invention.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a use of N-benzoylstaurosporine in the manufacture of a medicament suitable for oral administration and having e.g. high bioavailability levels and a reduced variability of bioavailability of N-benzoylstaurosporine.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides a use of N-benzoylstaurosporine in the manufacture of a medicament having high bioavailability levels and a reduced variability of bioavailability of N-benzoylstaurosporine.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are preferably compounded in unit dosage form, for example by filling them into orally administrable capsule shells. The capsule shells may be soft or hard gelatine capsule shells. Where the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is in unit dosage form, each unit dosage will suitably contain from 25 to 100 mg active agent, preferably between 25 and 75 mg of the active<br><br>
agent, for example 25 or 50 mg. Such unit dosage forms are suitable for administration 1 to 5 times daily depending upon the particular purpose of therapy, the component of therapy and the like. However, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be in drink solution form and may include water or any other aqueous system, to provide formulations suitable for drinking.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are particularly useful for treatment and prevention of the conditions disclosed in US 5,093,330, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Most notably, these compositions show high anti-proliferative and anti-tumor activity, as a result of Protein Kinase C (PKC) inhibition, which may be extremely useful for cancer treatment. Moreover, their highly selective and potent inhibition of PKC may lead to superior clinical outcomes for the patient (i.e. delay or suppress disease progression) with equally tolerable regimens. Potential applications include a variety of solid tumors and more specifically for example breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia. In addition, various other indications that may be affected by PKC activity may be effectively treated by these compositions, including Multidrug Resistance (MDR), one of the major problems in currently employed cancer chemotherapy, and inflammatory diseases in general.<br>
Thus, in another aspect the present invention provides a method of treatment comprising administering a dispersible pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention to a subject in need of such treatment.<br>
Following is a description by way of example only of compositions of this invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Examples 1 to 4<br>
Particulate measurements, including mean size measurement of dispersed particles (diameter), measured at a 90° scattering angle and a temperature 20°C, were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer 3000. The carrier was prepared by mixing the components one with another. The active agent N-benzoyl-staurosporine is then dissolved in the carrier by stirring. No phase separation or precipitation is observed for any of the described compositions 1 to 4 which are and remain clear. Table 1: Composition of Formulations 1 to 4<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma profiles of N-benmzoylstaurosporine administered in the following threee formulations A, B and C (filled into hard gelatin capsules) were analyzed:<br>
A        microemulsion preconcentrate containing Cremophor and PEG,<br>
B        microemulsion preconcentrate containing Cremophor and Labrafil,<br>
C	microemulsion preconcentrate containing Solutol.<br>
Using a two-block latin square design, two hard gelatin capsules of each formulation A, B or C<br>
containing N-benzoyl-staurosporine were deposited deeply into the throat of each of eight<br>
male Beagle dogs (3 to 5 years, 10 to 14 kg). A subsequent rinse of the throat was performed,<br>
using 20 mL of demineralized water to be swallowed. The nominal dose of 50 mg applied per<br>
animal corresponds to actual doses between 3.5 and 4.9 mg/kg body weight (see Table 2).<br>
The dogs were fasted for at least 15 h prior to administration, but had free access to tap water<br>
throughout the experiment. Around 6 h (range 6.0-6.3) after oral administration, each animal<br>
received around 350 g pellets. Blood (3 mL) was collected from the Vena cephalica into 5 mL<br>
polystyrene tubes containing Li-heparin as anticoagulant (at least 15 I.U. heparin per mL<br>
blood), at the following time points: 0 (= before) and 0.17, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24,<br>
30, 36, and 48 hours post dose. The heparinized blood samples were centrifuged (about 2150<br>
g, 10 min, about 4 °C), not longer than 30 min post withdrawal, and the supernatant plasma<br>
was collected into plain polystyrene tubes colored dark brown to avoid further daylight<br>
exposure. The plasma samples were frozen and stored below -18°C pending analysis.<br>
Concentrations of N-benzoyl-staurosporine in plasma were determined by an HPLC method<br>
with fluorescence detection.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax (highest observed concentration in plasma); tmax (time to<br>
reach Cmax); and AUC(0-48h) (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 48 h,<br>
calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule, wherein concentrations below the limit of quantitation<br>
(LOQ) were taken as "zero"), are listed in Table 2. Individual and mean (N=6*) plasma<br>
concentrations of N-benzoyl-staurosporine in dogs 1 to 8 after oral administration of single<br>
doses of 50 mg as formulation A, B, or C are shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively<br>
(wherein T stands for time after dosing, and M stands for the mean concentration).<br>
Dogs No. 2 and No. 6 were excluded from means calculation as it was questionable whether<br>
they properly ingested the appropriate dosages.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
