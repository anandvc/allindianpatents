				<td>VARIABLE VALVE LIFT TRANSITION CONTROL METHODS AND SYSTEMS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/981.276, filed on October 19, 2007. The disclosure of the<br>
above application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
controlling variable valve actuation systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Intake valves control the entry of an air/fuel mixture into<br>
cylinders of an internal combustion engine (ICE). Exhaust valves control the exit<br>
of gases from the cylinders of an intemal combustion engine. Camshaft lobes (or<br>
"cam lobes") on a camshaft push against the valves to open the valves as the<br>
camshaft rotates. Springs on the valves return the valves to a closed position.<br>
The timing, duration, and degree of the opening, or "valve lift," of the valves can<br>
impact performance.<br>
[0005] Variable valve actuation (WA) technology improves fuel<br>
economy, engine efficiency, and/or performance by modifying the valve event lift.<br><br>
timing, and duration as a function of engine operating conditions. Two-step WA<br>
systems enable two discrete valve events on the intake and/or exhaust valves.<br>
The engine control module (ECM) selects the optimal valve event profile that is<br>
best utilized for each engine operating condition.<br>
[0006] An issue in the development and application of VVA system is<br>
the response time variability of the control system and hardware. A limited<br>
amount of time is available for switching a Switching Roller Finger Follower<br>
(SRFF) between engaging and disengaging. If the control valve causes a fluid<br>
pressure change in a lifter fluid gallery to occur too soon relative to a valve lift<br>
curve, a SRFF arm lock pin may only partially engage and then disengage after<br>
the valve has started lifting. This unscheduled disengagement may cause the<br>
engine valve to drop from the high-lift valve event to the low-lift valve event, or on<br>
to the valve seat. After a number of such events, the SRFF arm or the valve may<br>
show signs of accelerated wear or damage.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, a system for controlling a variable valve lift system<br>
of an engine, comprises a delay module that estimates a total delay based on at<br>
least one of a measured and an estimated delay of the variable valve lift system.<br>
A variable valve control module commands one of a first transition from a<br>
variable valve low-lift profile to a variable valve high-lift profile and a second<br><br>
transition from a variable valve high-lift profile to a variable valve low-lift profile<br>
based on the total delay.<br>
[0008] In other features, the variable valve control module commands<br>
the first transition and the second transition based on a range of crankshaft<br>
angular positions that is adjusted based on the total delay. The range is defined<br>
by a maximum crankshaft angular position and a minimum crankshaft angular<br>
position, and wherein the variable valve control module adjusts the range by<br>
subtracting the total delay from at least one of the maximum crankshaft angular<br>
position and the minimum crankshaft angular position.<br>
[0009] In other features, an engine control module controls one of<br>
throttle position, spark timing, and camshaft phaser movement based on the first<br>
transition from the variable valve low-lift profile to the variable valve high-lift<br>
profile. The engine control module adjusts the control of the at least one of the<br>
throttle position, the spark timing, and the camshaft phaser movement prior to the<br>
first transition from the variable valve low-lift profile to the variable valve high-lift<br>
profile.<br>
[0010] In other features, an engine control module controls engine<br>
torque based on the second transition from the variable valve high-lift profile to<br>
the variable valve low-lift profile. The engine control module controls engine<br>
torque after the second transition from the variable valve high-lift profile to the<br>
variable valve low-lift profile.<br>
[0011] In other features, the variable valve control module commands<br>
the first transition from the variable valve low-lift profile to the variable valve high-<br><br>
lift profile and the second transition from the variable valve high-lift profile to the<br>
variable valve low-lift profile based on a desired engine torque.<br>
[0012] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0013] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0014] Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary six-<br>
cylinder engine including a variable valve lift (VVL) system according to various<br>
aspects of the present disclosure.<br>
[0015] Figure 2 is a dataflow diagram illustrating an exemplary WL<br>
control system according to various aspects of the present disclosure.<br>
[0016] Figures 3 through 5 are flowcharts illustrating an exemplary WL<br>
control method according to various aspects of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br><br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0018] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air is drawn<br>
into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates air flow<br>
into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is distributed into<br>
cylinders 18. Although six cylinders are illustrated, the engine 12 may include<br>
additional or fewer cylinders 18. For example, engines having 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10,<br>
and 12 cylinders are contemplated. Although Figure 1 depicts the cylinders in a<br>
V-shaped configuration, it is appreciated that the cylinders 18 can be<br>
implemented in an inline configuration. A fuel injector 19 injects fuel that is<br>
combined with air as it is drawn into the cylinder 18. A fuel injection system (not<br>
shown) regulates (timing, amount, etc.) the fuel injector 19 to provide a desired<br>
air-to-fuel ratio within each cylinder 18.<br>
[0019] According to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure, each cylinder 18 may include an intake valve 20 and an exhaust<br>
valve 21. The intake valve 20 selectively opens and closes to enable the air<br>
and/or air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinders 18. Intake camshafts 24 regulate<br>
intake valve open and close events. The exhaust valves 21 selectively open and<br>
close to enable the exhaust to exit the cylinders 18. Exhaust valve open and<br>
close events are regulated by exhaust camshafts 32. Although a single intake<br><br>
valve 20 and a single exhaust valve 21 are shown per cylinder 18, multiple intake<br>
valves and multiple exhaust valves can be configured per cylinder 18.<br>
[0020] A piston (not shown) compresses the air/fuel mixture within the<br>
cylinder 18. A spark plug (not shown) initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture.<br>
The piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. The<br>
crankshaft drives the intake and exhaust camshafts 24, 32 using a timing chain<br>
(not shown). It is appreciated that dual intake camshafts and dual exhaust<br>
camshafts may be implemented. An engine speed sensor 35 generates an<br>
engine speed signal indicating the rotational speed of the engine 12 in<br>
revolutions per minute {RPM).<br>
[0021] The engine 12 may include intake cam phasers 36 and exhaust<br>
cam phasers 38 that adjust the rotational timing of the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts 24, 32, respectively. More specifically, a phase angle of the intake<br>
and exhaust cam phasers 36, 38 may be retarded or advanced to control relative<br>
timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts 24, 32.<br>
[0022] A variable valve (WL) system 39 interacts with the camshafts<br>
24, 32 to regulate valve open and close events. The WL system 39 includes a<br>
plurality of switching roller finger followers (SRFFs) 40. Each SRFF 40 includes<br>
a low-lift contact that interfaces with a low-lift cam lobe (not shown) affixed to the<br>
camshafts 24, 32 and one or more high-lift contacts (not shown) that interface<br>
with one or more high-lift cams lobes (not shown) affixed to the camshafts 24, 32.<br>
As the camshafts 24, 32 rotate, the cam lobes contact the SRFFs 40 which, in<br>
turn, open and close the respective valve or valves 20, 21. Each SRFF 40 is<br><br>
controlled such that the valves 20, 21 are selectively operated according to at<br>
least one of a low-lift profile and a high-lift profile. In particular, pressurized fluid<br>
is supplied by a solenoid operated valve 42 to the SRFF 40 to release and/or<br>
engage a locking pin 44. The locking pin 44 serves to activate and deactivate<br>
the low-lift contact and/or the high-lift contact.<br>
[0023] A control module 50 controls the supply of pressurized fluid to<br>
each SRFF 40 system to engage and disengage the locking pins 44. In<br>
particular, the control module 50 commands the supply of fluid pressure such<br>
that inadvertent locking pin disengagement does not occur. In various<br>
embodiments, the control module 50 schedules the transition between the high-<br>
lift profile and the low-lift profile by: first computing a current time delay in<br>
degrees of crankshaft rotation; and, then, applying the time delay to known<br>
locations where an incomplete locking pin engagement is feasible to determine a<br>
crankshaft angular position where the command should be initiated. The<br>
command is then initiated at that time to eliminate the undesirable, unscheduled,<br>
disengagements and their associated audibles.<br>
[0024] Referring now to Figure 2, a WL control system 49 is shown<br>
that may be embedded within the control module 50. Various embodiments of<br>
WL control systems 49 according to the present disclosure may include any<br>
number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 50. As can be<br>
appreciated, the sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned<br>
to similarly control the WL system 39 and/or other engine components. Inputs<br>
to the WL control system 49 may be sensed from the engine system 10 (Figure<br><br>
1), received from other control modules (not shown), and/or determined by other<br>
sub-modules (not shown) within the control module 50. In various embodiments,<br>
the control module 50 of Figure 2 includes a delay determination module 52, a<br>
transition determination module 54, a state transition module 58, and an engine<br>
control module 56.<br>
[0025] The delay determination module 52 estimates a total time delay<br>
68 based on measured and/or estimated time delays associated with the<br>
hardware involved in controlling the WL system 39 (Figure 1). In various<br>
embodiments, the delay determination module 52 estimates a total time delay 68<br>
based on a time delay associated with the control solenoid (tsolenoid). a time delay<br>
associated with the pressure rise (tcontrol_pressure_rise), and a time delay associated<br>
with the actuator (taduator). In various embodiments, the total time delay 68 can<br>
be estimated based on the following equation:<br><br>
The control solenoid time delay (tsolenoid) can be estimated as a function of<br>
voltage (V) and oil temperature {Toil}, as shown as:<br><br>
The control pressure rise time delay (tcontrol_pressure_rise) can be estimated as a<br>
function of oil supply pressure (Psupply) and oil temperature (Toil), as shown as:<br><br>
The actuator time delay (tactuator) can be estimated as a function of control<br>
pressure (Pcontrol) and oil temperature (Toil), as shown as:<br><br><br>
[0026] Based on the total time delay 68 and a current engine speed<br>
(RPM) 66, the delay determination module 52 converts the total time delay 68 to<br>
degrees of crankshaft rotation. In various embodiments, the total time delay 68<br>
can be converted to degrees of crankshaft rotation (Degdelay) based on the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
[0027] The transition determination module 54 estimates whether a<br>
transition between a low-lift profile and a high-lift profile is desired based on a<br>
current lift state 72 and a desired torque 70. For example, the transition<br>
determination module 54 estimates that a transition from a low-lift profile to a<br>
high-lift profile is desired (desired lift state 74) when the current lift state 72 is the<br>
low-lift state and the desired torque 70 is greater than a low-lift torque threshold.<br>
In another example, the transition determination module 54 projects that a<br>
transition from a high-lift profile to a low-lift profile is desired (desired lift state 74)<br>
when the current lift state 72 is the high-lift state and the desired torque 70 is less<br>
than a high-lift torque threshold. In various embodiments, the desired torque 70<br>
can be estimated based on engine operating parameters.<br>
[0028] The state transition module 58 schedules the transition based<br>
on the desired lift state 74 and commands the pressurized fluid via a fluid<br>
command 82 at the scheduled time such that the transition occurs. In various<br>
embodiments, the transition is scheduled by subtracting the total time delay 68 in<br>
crankshaft degrees from known locations, in crankshaft degrees, where an<br><br>
incomplete pin engagement is feasible. Such known locations can be<br>
predetermined and/or estimated real-time based on engine performance.<br>
[0029] The engine control module 56 controls one or more components<br>
of the engine system (Figure 1) based on the current lift state 72. The engine<br>
control module 56 controls the one or more components to prepare the engine 12<br>
(Figure 1) for the transitions between the low-lift profile and the high-lift profile. In<br>
various embodiments, the engine control module 56 controls at least one of the<br>
throttle 16 (Figure 1), the cam phasers 36, 38 (Figure 1), and the spark (not<br>
shown) via control signals 78, 70 and 76, respectively, before the fluid and, thus,<br>
the state transition is commanded. In various embodiments, the engine control<br>
module 56 controls engine torque by performing one or more torque smoothing<br>
methods known in the art after the fluid and, thus, the state transition is<br>
commanded.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figures 3 through 5, flowcharts illustrate a WL<br>
control method 98 that can be performed by the WL control system 49 of Figure<br>
2 in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. As can be<br>
appreciated, the order of execution of the steps of the WL control method 98<br>
can vary without altering the spirit of the method. The WL control method 98<br>
may be perfonned periodically during control module operation or scheduled to<br>
run based on certain events. The method may begin at 100.<br>
[0031] The current lift state 72 and the desired torque 70 are evaluated<br>
at 110,120, and 130. If the current lift state 72 is the low-lift state at 110. and the<br>
desired torque 70 is greater than a low-lift torque threshold at 120, the total time<br><br><br>
delay 68 is computed in crankshaft degrees at 140 (as discussed above); and the<br>
throttle 16 (Figure 1), cam phasers 36, 38 (Figure 1), and spark (not shown) are<br>
adjusted for the state change at 150 (as discussed above). If, however, the<br>
current lift state 72 is the low-lift state at 110 and the desired torque 70 is less<br>
than or equal to the low-lift torque threshold at 120, a transition is not desired and<br>
the method may end at 260.<br>
[0032] If the current lift state 72 is the high-lift state (not equal to the<br>
low-lift state) at 110, and the desired torque 70 is less than a high-lift torque<br>
threshold at 130, control proceeds to evaluate again the current lift state 72 at<br>
160. Otherwise, if the current lift state 72 is the high-lift state at 110, and the<br>
desired torque 70 is greater than or equal to the high-lift torque threshold at 130,<br>
a transition is not desired and the method may end at 260.<br>
[0033] At 160, once a transition is desired, if the current lift state 72 is<br>
still the low-lift state or has become the low-lift state, the next cylinder (cylinder<br>
ID) to perfomn intake charge is identified at 170, a minimum and maximum<br>
angular position allowable for transitioning to the next lift state are determined at<br>
190, and the minimum and maximum are evaluated at 200 and 210. The<br>
minimum and maximum define a range at which the transition can take place.<br>
The range is adjusted by the estimated total time delay 68 (e.g., subtracting the<br>
total time delay from the minimum and the maximum). If the current crankshaft<br>
position is outside of the adjusted range for that cylinder, the transition is not<br>
made. If the cun-ent crankshaft position is within the adjusted range for that<br>
cylinder at 200 and 210, the appropriate solenoid operated valve 42 (Figure 1) is<br><br><br>
selected at 220, the state is transitioned at 230, and torque smoothing is<br>
commanded at 240.<br>
[0034] The method continues to transition the state for each cylinder<br>
until all solenoid operated valves 42 (Figure 1) have transitioned. Once all<br>
solenoid operated valves 42 (Figure 1) have transitioned at 250, the method may<br>
end at 260. Othenvise, the method continues at 180 by incrementing the cylinder<br>
ID and evaluating the minimum and maximums at 190, 200, and 210.<br>
[0035] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>

crankshaft angular positions is performed per cylinder of the engine.<br><br><br>
13.	The method of claim 10 further comprising controlling at least one<br>
of throttle position, spark timing, and camshaft phaser movement based on the<br>
first transition from the variable valve low-lift profile to the variable valve high-lift<br>
profile.<br>
14.	The method of claim 13 wherein the controlling the at least one of<br>
the throttle position, the spark timing, and the camshaft phaser movement occurs<br>
prior to the commanding the first transition from the variable valve low-lift profile<br>
to the variable valve high-lift profile.<br>
15.	The method of claim 10 further comprising controlling engine torque<br>
based on the second transition from the variable valve high-lift profile to the<br>
variable valve low-lift profile.<br>
16.	The method of claim 16 wherein the performing comprises<br>
controlling engine torque after the commanding the second transition from the<br>
variable valve high-lift profile to the variable valve low-lift profile.<br>
17.	The method of claim 10 wherein the commanding comprises<br>
commanding the first transition from the variable valve low-lift profile to the<br>
variable valve high-lift profile and the second transition from the variable valve<br>
high-lift profile to the variable valve low-lift profile based on a desired engine<br>
torque.<br><br><br>
18.	The method of claim 10 wherein the estimating comprises:<br>
computing the total delay as a summation of at least one of<br>
measured and estimated delays of the variable valve lift system; and<br>
converting the total delay to degrees of crankshaft rotation, and<br>
wherein the commanding the first transition from the variable valve<br>
low-lift profile to the variable valve high-lift profile and the second transition from<br>
a variable valve high-lift profile to the variable valve low-lift profile is based on the<br>
converted total delay.<br>
19.	The method of claim 19 wherein the converting the total delay<br>
(tdelay) to degrees of crankshaft rotation (Degdelay) is based on engine speed<br>
{RPM) and the following equation:<br><br>
20.	The method of claim 10 wherein the estimating the total delay is<br>
based on a solenoid time delay determined as a function of voltage and fluid<br>
temperature.<br>
21.	The method of claim 10 wherein the estimating the total delay is<br>
based on a control pressure rise time delay determined as a function of fluid<br>
supply pressure and fluid temperature.<br><br>
22. The method of claim 10 wherein the estimating the total delay is<br>
based on an actuator time delay determined as a function of control pressure and<br>
fluid temperature.<br><br>
A system for controlling a variable valve lift system of an engine comprises a delay module that estimates a total delay based on at least one of a measured and an estimated delay of the variable valve lift system. A variable valve control module commands one of a first transition from a variable valve low-lift profile to a variable valve high-lift profile and a second transition from a variable valve<br>
high-lift profile to a variable valve low-lift profile based on the total delay.</td>
