				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention involves compounds that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment using such compounds for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and related diseases and conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inhibition of leukotriene biosynthesis has been an active area of pharmaceutical research for many years. Leukotrienes are potent contractile and inflammatory mediators derived through the o.xygenation of arachidonic acid by 5-lipoxygenase.<br>
One class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors are those known to act through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). In general, 5-LO inhibitors have been sought for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, asthma and inflammatory conditions including arthritis. One example of a 5-LO inhibitor is the marketed drug zileuton, which is indicated for the treatment of asthma. More recently, it has been reported that 5-LO may be an important contributor to the atherogenic process; see Mehrabian, M. et al., Circulation Research, 2002 Jul 26, 91(2): 120-126.<br>
A new class of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors (now known as FLAP inhibitors) distinct from 5-LO inhibitors is described in Miller, D.K. et al., Nature, vol. 343, No. 6255, pp. 278-281, 18 Jan 1990. These compounds inhibit the formation of cellular leukotrienes but have no direct effect on soluble 5-LO activity. These compounds were used to identify and isolate the inner nuclear membrane 18,000 dalton protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). In cells, arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by the action of cytosolic phospholipase 2. This arachidonic acid is transferred to nuclear membrane bound 5-lipoxygenase by FLAP. The presence of FLAP in cells is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes. Additionally, based on studies described in Helgadottir, A., et al., Nature Genetics, vol 36, no. 3 (March 2004) 233-239, it is believed that the gene encoding 5-lipoxygenase activating protein confers risk for myocardial infarction and stroke in humans.<br>
Despite significant therapeutic advances in the treatment and prevention of<br>
atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events, such as the improvements that have been achieved with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, further treatment options are clearly needed. The instant<br>
invention addresses that need by providing compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment or prevention of atherosclerosis as well as related conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention relates to compounds of formula I which are FLAP inhibitors, methods for their preparation, and methods and pharmaceutical formulations for using these compounds in mammals, especially humans. This invention provides compounds of structural formula I:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and solvates thereof. This invention also involves the use of compounds described herein to slow or halt atherogenesis. Therefore, one object of the instant invention is to provide a method for treating atherosclerosis, which includes halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease once it has become clinically evident, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I to a patient in need of such treatment. Another object is to provide methods for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic disease events, comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient who is at risk of developing atherosclerosis or having an atherosclerotic disease event.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are also useful as anti-asthmatic, anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective agents. They are also useful in treating angina, cerebral spasm, glomerular nephritis, hepatitis, endotoxemia, uveitis, and allograft rejection. The instant invention provides methods of treatment comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of the above-described treatments.<br>
A further object is to provide the use of FLAP inhibitors of formula I in combination with other therapeutically effective agents, including other anti-atherosclerotic drugs. These and other objects will be evident from the description contained herein.<br>

The compounds of formula I can be used for the treatment of atherosclerosis comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I to a patient in need of such treatment. A further aspect of this invention involves a method for preventing or reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a compound of formula I to a patient in need of such treatment. Atherosclerosis is characterized by the deposition of atheromatous plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on the innermost layer of the walls of large and medium-sized arteries. Atherosclerosis encompasses vascular diseases and conditions that are recognized and understood by physicians practicing in the relevant fields of medicine. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including restenosis following revascularization procedures, coronary heart disease (also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease), cerebrovascular disease including multi-infarct dementia, and peripheral vessel disease including erectile dysfunction, are all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis and are therefore encompassed by the terms "atherosclerosis" and "atherosclerotic disease."<br>
A FLAP inhibitor may be administered to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence, or recurrence where the potential exists, of a coronary heart disease event, a cerebrovascular event, and/or intermittent claudication. Coronary heart disease events are intended to include CHD death, myocardial infarction (i.e., a heart attack), and coronary revascularization procedures. Cerebrovascular events are intended to include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accidents) and transient ischemic attacks. Intermittent claudication is a clinical manifestation of peripheral vessel disease. The term "atherosclerotic disease event" as used herein is intended to encompass coronary heart disease events, cerebrovascular events, and intermittent claudication. It is intended that persons who have previously experienced one. or more non-fatal atherosclerotic disease events are those for whom the potential for recurrence of such an event exists.<br>
Accordingly, the instant invention also provides a method for preventing or reducing the risk of a first or subsequent occurrence of an atherosclerotic disease event comprising the administration of a prophylactically effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor to a patient at risk for such an event. The patient may already have atherosclerotic disease at the time of administration, or may be at risk for developing it.<br>
The method of this invention particularly serves to prevent or slow new atherosclerotic lesion or plaque formation, and to prevent or slow progression of existing lesions or plaques, as well as to<br>
cause regression of existing lesions or plaques. Accordingly, one aspect of this invention involves a method for halting or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis, including halting or slowing atherosclerotic plaque progression, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor to a patient in need of such treatment. This method also includes halting or slowing progression of atherosclerotic plaques existing at the time the instant treatment is begun (i.e., "existing atherosclerotic plaques"), as well as halting or slowing formation of new atherosclerotic plaques in patients with atherosclerosis.<br>
Another aspect of this invention involves a method for regression of atherosclerosis, including regression of atherosclerotic plaques existing at the time the instant treatment is begun, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor to a patient in need of such treatment. Another aspect of this invention involves a method for preventing or reducing the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture comprising administering a prophylactically effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
The ability of the compounds of Formula I to inhibit biosynthesis of the leukotrienes makes them useful for preventing or reversing the symptoms induced by the leukotrienes in a human subject. This inhibition of the mammalian biosynthesis of leukotrienes indicates that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are useful to treat, prevent, or ameliorate in mammals and especially in humans:  1) pulmonary disorders including diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and related obstructive airway diseases, 2) allergies and allergic reactions such as allergic rhinitis, contact dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and the like, 3) inflammation such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel    . disease, 4) pain, 5) skin disorders such as atopic eczema, and the like, 6) cardiovascular disorders such as angina, formation of atherosclerotic plaques, myocardial ischemia, hypertension, platelet aggregation and the like, 7) renal insufficiency arising from ischaemia induced by immunological or chemical (cyclosporin) etiology and 8) migraine or cluster headache, 9) ocular conditions such as uveitis, 10) hepatitis resulting from chemical, immunological or infectious stimuli, 11) trauma or shock states such as burn injuries, endotoxemia and the like, 12) allograft rejection, 13) prevention of side effects associated with therapeutic administration of cytokines such as Interleukin n and tumor necrosis factor, 14) chronic lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchitis and other small- and large-airway diseases, 15) cholecystitis, 16) multiple sclerosis, and 17) proliferation of myoblastic leukemia cells.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat or prevent mammalian (especially, human) disease states such as erosive gastritis; erosive esophagitis; diarrhea; cerebral spasm; premature labor; spontaneous abortion; dysmenorrhea; ischemia; noxious agent-induced damage or necrosis of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, or myocardial tissue; liver parenchymal damage caused<br>
by hepatoxic agents such as CC14 and D-galactosamine; ischemic renal failure; disease-induced hepatic damage; bile salt induced pancreatic or gastric damage; trauma- or stress-induced cell damage; and glycerol-induced renal failure. The compounds also act as inhibitors of tumor metastasis and exhibit cytoprotective action.<br>
The FLAP inhibitors of this invention can also be administered for prevention, amelioration and treatment of glomerulonephritis (see Guasch A., Zayas C.F., Badr KF. (1999), "MK-591 acutely restores glomerular size selectivity and reduces proteinuria in human glomerulonephritis," Kidney Int., 56:261-267); and also for and prevention, amelioration and treatment of kidney damage resulting from diabetes complications (see Valdivielso JM, Montero A., Badr KF., Munger KA. (2003), "Inhibition of FLAP decreases proteinuria in diabetic rats," J. Nephrol., 16(1):S5-940.)<br>
In addition, the compounds of this invention can also be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As described in S. Kilfeather, Chest, 2002, vol 121, 197, airway neutrophilia in COPD patients is believed to be a contributing source of inflammation and is associated with airway remodeling. The presence of neutrophils is mediated in part by LTB4, and treatment with the<br>
instant compounds could be used to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in patients with COPD.<br>
The cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of the gastrointestinal mucosa to the noxious effects of strong irritants, for example, the ulcerogenic effects of asprrin or indomethacin. In addition to lessening the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the gastrointestinal tract, animal studies show that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline solutions, and the like. Two assays can be used to measure cytoprotective ability. These assays are: (A) an ethanol-induced lesion assay and (B) an indomethacin-induced ulcer assay and are described in EP 140,684.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention would be useful to reduce the gastric erosion caused by co-administration of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and low-dose aspirin. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors are widely used as effective anti-inflammatory drugs with less potential for gastrointestinal complications as compared to traditional, non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the combined use of a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor with low-dose aspirin for cardio protection may compromise the gastrointestinal safety of this class of compounds. By virtue of its activity as a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, the compounds of the invention would be expected to be gastric protective in this regard. See Fiorucci, et al. FASEB J. 17:1171-1173, 2003. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors for use with the invention include but are not limited to rofecoxib (VIOXX®), etoricoxib (ARCOXIA™), celecoxib (CELEBREX®) and valdecoxib (BEXTRA™). A<br>
compound of this invention in combination with a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form or separately to a patient on low-dose aspirin therapy. Alternatively, the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor could be administered in unit dosage form with low-dose aspirin, in which case a compound of this invention would be administered separately. All three active ingredients in unit dosage form is also encompassed. Conventional dosage amounts of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor and aspirin (for cardio protection) may be utilized. For example, rofecoxib could be administered at 12.5 nig, 25 mg or 50 mg once daily. Aspirin could be administered at 81 mg once daily. In general, FLAP inhibitors can be identified as those compounds which have an ICfQ in<br>
the "FLAP Binding Assay" that is less than or equal to 1 pM, and preferably 500 nM or less.<br>
The term "patient" includes mammals, especially humans, who use the instant active agents for the prevention or treatment of a medical condition. Administering of the drug to the patient includes both self-administration and administration to the patient by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may deske prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of onset of atherosclerosis.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" is intended to mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, a system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term "prophylactically effective amount" is intended to mean that amount of a pharmaceutical drug that will prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of the biological or medical event that is sought to be prevented in a tissue, a system, animal or human by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician.<br>
An effective amount of a FLAP inhibitor in the method of this invention is in the range of about 0.001 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 1 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. A single daily dose is preferred but not necessary. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. As examples, the daily dosage amount may be selected from, but not limited to 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 250 mg.   It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the patient's condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition. It is expected that the FLAP inhibitor will administered chronically on a daily basis for a<br>
length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient, including a course of therapy lasting months, years or the life of the patient.<br>
In a broad embodiment, any suitable additional active agent or agents, including but not limited to anti-atherosclerotic agents, may be used in combination with the compound of formula I in a single dosage formulation, or may be administered to the patient in a separate dosage formulation, which allows for concurrent or sequential administration of the active agents. One or more additional active agents may be administered with a compound of Formula I. The. additional active agent or agents can be lipid modifying compounds or agents having other pharmaceutical activities, or agents that have both lipid-modifying effects and other pharmaceutical activities. Examples of additional active agents which may be employed include but are not limited to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which include statins in their lactonized or dihydroxy open acid forms and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, including but not limited to lovastatin (see US Patent No. 4,342,767), simvastatin (see US Patent No. 4,444,784), dihydroxy open-acid simvastatin, particularly the ammonium or calcium salts thereof, pravastatin, particularly the sodium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 4,346,227), fluvastatin particularly the sodium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 5,354,772), atorvastatin, particularly the calcium salt thereof (see US Patent No. 5,273,995), pitavastatin also referred to as NK-104 (see PCT international publication number WO 97/23200) and rosuvastatin, also known as ZD-4522, (CRESTOR®; see US Patent No. 5,260,440, and Drugs of the Future, 1999,24(5), pp. 511-513); 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors; cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, for example JTT-705 and torcetrapib, alsoknown as CP529,414; HMG-CoA synthase inhibitors; squalene epoxidase inhibitors; squalene synthetase inhibitors (also known as squalene synthase inhibitors), acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors including selective inhibitors of ACAT-1 or ACAT-2 as well as dual inhibitors of ACAT-1 and -2; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors; niacin; bile acid sequestrants; LDL (low density lipoprotein) receptor inducers; platelet aggregation inhibitors, for example glycoprotein Ilb/HIa fibrinogen receptor antagonists and aspirin; human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARY) agonists including the compounds commonly referred to as glitazones for example pioglitazone and rosiglitazone and, including those compounds included within the structural class known as thiazolidinediones as well as those PPARy agonists outside the thiazolidine dione structural class; PPARcc agonists such as clofibrate, fenofibrate including micronized fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil; PPAR dual O/Y agonists; vitamin Bg (also known as pyridoxine) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof such as the HC1 salt; vitamin Bi2 (also known as cyanocobalamin); folic acid or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof such as the sodium salt and the methylglucamine salt; anti-oxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and E and beta carotene; beta-blockers; angiotensin n<br>
antagonists such as losartan; angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as enalapril and captopril; calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and diltiazam; endothelian antagonists; agents that enhance ABCA1 gene expression; FXR and LXR ligands including both inhibitors and agonists; bisphosphonate compounds such as alendronate sodium; and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such as rofecoxib and celecoxib.<br>
Still another type of agent that can be used in combination with the compounds of this invention are cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall. This blockade is their primary mode of action in reducing serum cholesterol levels. These compounds are distinct from compounds which reduce serum cholesterol levels primarily by mechanisms of action such as acyl coenzyme A - cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibition, inhibition of triglyceride synthesis, MTP inhibition, bile acid sequestration, and transcription modulation such as agonists or antagonists of nuclear hormones. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors are described in U.S. Patent 5,846,966, U.S. Patent 5,631,365, U.S. Patent 5,767,115, U.S. Patent 6,133,001, U.S. Patent 5,886,171, U.S. Patent 5,856,473, U.S. Patent 5,756,470, U.S. Patent 5,739,321, U.S. Patent 5,919,672, WO 00/63703, WO /0060107, WO 00/38725, WO 00/34240, WO 00/20623, WO 97/45406, WO 97/16424, WO 97/16455, and WO 95/08532.<br>
An exemplary cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe, also known as SCH-58235, which is l-(4-fluorophenyl)-3(R)-[3(S)-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl)]-4(S)-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-azetidinone, described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,767,115 and 5,846,966 and shown below as<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
Additional exemplary hydroxy-substituted azetidinone cholesterol absorption inhibitors are specifically described in U.S. Patent 5,767,115, column 39, lines 54-61 and column 40, lines 1-51, represented by the formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
as defined in column 2, lines 20-63. These and other cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be identified according to the assay of hypolipidemic compounds using the hyperlipidemic hamster described in U.S. Patent 5,767,115, column 19, lines 47-65, in which hamsters are fed a controlled cholesterol diet and dosed with test compounds for seven days. Plasma lipid analysis is conducted and data is reported as percent reduction of lipid versus control.<br>
Therapeutically effective amounts of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include dosages of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg of body weight per day, preferably about 0.1 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the dosage level is therefore from about 0.7 mg to about 2100 mg of drug per day, e.g. 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200 mg per day, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response when the cholesterol absorption inhibitor is used in combination with a compound of the instant invention.<br>
In the method of treatment of this invention, the FLAP inhibitors may be administered via any suitable route of administration such as orally, parenterally, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Oral formulations are preferred.<br>
For oral use, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention containing the active ingredient may be in forms such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for<br>
example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc.<br>
Oral immediate-release and time-controlled release dosage forms may be employed, as well as enterically coated oral dosage forms. Tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. One example of a time-controlled release device is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,366,738. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.<br>

The phrase "standard peptide coupling reaction conditions" means coupling a carboxylic acid with an amine using an acid activating agent such as HATU, EDC, and PyBOP in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF in the presence of a auxiliary nucleophile such as HO AT or HOBT. The use of protecting groups for the amine and carboxylic acid functionalities to facilitate the desired<br>
reaction and minimize undesired reactions is well documented. Conditions required to add and remove protecting groups are found in standard textbooks such as Greene, T, and Wilts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY, 1999. CBZ and BOC are commonly used amino protecting groups in organic synthesis, and their removal conditions are known to those skilled in the art. For example, CBZ may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal or its oxide such as palladium on activated carbon in a protic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. In cases where catalytic hydrogenation is contraindicated due to the presence of other potentially reactive functionalities, removal of CBZ groups can also be achieved by treatment with a solution of hydrogen bromide in acetic acid or by treatment with a mixture of TFA and dimethylsulfide. Removal of BOC protecting groups is carried out with a strong acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, or hydrogen chloride gas, in a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxane, methanol, or ethyl acetate.<br><br>

Reaction schemes A-M illustrate preferred methods for the syntheses of compounds of the present invention of structural formula I. All substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.<br>
Reaction scheme A illustrates the preferred methods for the synthesis of a ketone of type<br>
1.	In general, 1 can be either purchased commercially or synthesized according to literature methods.<br>
An alcohol of type 2 or an alkene of type 3 can also be used to prepare 1, using known methods in<br>
organic synthesis. For example, 2 can be converted to 1 using a direct oxidation protocol. A preferred<br>
method for effecting such a transformation may involve treatment of 2 with any agent capable of<br>
oxidizing carbon-oxygen single bonds, such as the Dess-Martin Periodinane, PCC, TPAP or the like. In<br>
another method, 3 can also be converted to 1 using a two-step hydroboration-oxidation sequence. In this<br>
case, 3 is first treated with a suitable hydroborating agent such as 9-BBN, diborane or the like, to<br>
generate the intermediary alkyl borane. The latter species is generally not isolated, but oxidized in situ to<br>
2.	The latter can then be converted to 1 using the aforementioned oxidation methods.<br>

Some useful literature references for the preparation of 1 include: LeBel, N. A.,<br>
Liesemer, R. N. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965, 87, 4301; Gibson, T. /. Org. Chem. 1972, 37, 700; Nicolaou, K. C., Magolda, R. L., Claremon, D. A., /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980,102, 1404; Meltzer, P. C.; Blundell, P., Chen, Z., Yong, Y. F., Madras, B. K., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 1999, 9, S57.<br>
Reaction scheme B illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of a compound of type 8. In this method, 1 is treated with an organorhetallic reagent of type 4, capable of transferring an aryl group. Preferred organometallic reagents for this transformation include organomagnesium (Grignard) or<br>
organolithium compounds. When Grignard reagents are employed as shown in scheme B, it is customary to conduct the reaction in a suitable ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, THF or mixtures thereof, at temperatures between -78 °C and the boiling temperature of the solvent. In the case of an organolithium reagent, the reaction can be conducted in a variety of solvents such as diethyl ether or hexanes, at temperatures between -78 °C and room temperature. The Grignard and the organolithium reagents are often purchased commercially, but can be prepared synthetically according to known methods in organic synthesis. The product from this reaction is an alcohol of type 5, which can be arylated in an electrophilic aromatic substitution process called the Friedel-Crafts reaction. Typical conditions for effecting such an arylation include generation of an intermediate tertiary carbocation of type 7, derived from 5, followed by in situ trapping with a suitable aromatic-coupling partner of type 6. Formation of 7 may occur spontaneously in solution or it may be promoted with a reagent capable of ionizing 5, like a protic acid such as p-TSA, or concentrated hydrochloric acid or a suitable Lewis acid. In certain cases, it may be preferable to conduct the reaction in the presence of a free radical scavenger such as 3-mercaptopropionic acid or the like. The reaction is conducted typically in an inert organic solvent, at temperatures between -20 °C and the boiling temperature of the solvent. The product is a compound of type 8, which can be elaborated to compounds of the present invention as described in the subsequent schemes.<br>
Scheme B<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme C illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of a compound of structural formula 10 in which it is desirable to first elaborate the more reactive hydroxyl group (1-<br>
position) of 8. For example, 8 can be directly alkylated using an alkylating agent of type 9. The reaction is conducted typically in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate, in a polar aprotic solvent such as DMF, in which the substituent LG of 9 is a good leaving group such as halide, mesylate or triflate. The major products from the reaction are the monoalkylated product of structural formula 10 and the to-alkylated product of structural formula 12 which can be readily separated by flash chromatography. In some cases, a small amount of the regioisomeric mono-alkylated product of type 11 is also observed. In 10, as in the rest of the following schemes, the OR or other group shown at position 1 is equivalent to -(CR2R3)d-X-(CR4R5)e-Y-(Rla)2 of formula I and the 4-position OR or other group, such as in formula 12, is equivalent to R1 of formula I.<br>
Scheme C<br>
 (Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme D illustrates a protecting group strategy for the synthesis of a compound of type 15 in which it is desirable to first elaborate the less reactive hydroxyl group (4-position) of 8. For example, the more reactive hydroxyl group (1-position) of S can be selectively protected using a silicon based protecting group approach. In this method, S is treated with a suitable silylating agent such as chloro-tert-butyldiphenylsilane, in the presence of imidazole, in a solvent like DMF. The reaction is conducted typically at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature, for periods of 12-24 h. The product is a silyl ether of type 13, which can be directly alkylated using the conditions described in the discussion for scheme C. The silicon protecting group can be removed by any of the appropriate desilylation methods such as treatment with TB AF in THF or hydrogen fluoride in pyridine and the product of this reaction is a phenol of type 15.<br><br>
Scheme D<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme E illustrates some of the preferred methods of elaboration of 10. For example, 10 can be treated with a triflating agent such as triflic anhydride or the like in the presence of a suitable base such as pyridine or triethylamine in an aprotic solvent like toluene. It is customary to conduct the reaction at temperatures between -78 °C and room temperature, for periods of 1-24 h. The product of the reaction is a triflate of structural formula 16 which can be elaborated by a variety of synthetic methods known to those skilled in organic synthesis, three of which are outlined in schemes F, G and H.<br>
Alternatively, 10 can be treated with an isocyanate of type 17 in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, in an inert solvent like toluene. Typically, 17 can be purchased commercially or prepared synthetically and the product of the reaction is a carbamate of structural formula 18. In certain cases it may be preferable to generate 17 in situ, and this is typically accomplished from an appropriate precursor such as an acyl azide. In an alternative method, 10 can be treated with a suitable carbonyl equivalent such as phosgene, triphosgene or carbonyl diimidazole. After a short period of time, typically between 0.1-1 hour, a primary or secondary amine is added and the product of the reaction is a carbamate of structural formula 18. The reaction sequence is conducted in a suitable inert organic solvent like methylene chloride, at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature, for periods of 1-24 h.<br>
In yet another example, 10 can be directly alkylated using the conditions described in the discussion of scheme C to afford a derivative of structural formula 19.<br>
Scheme E<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme F illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of compounds of structural formula 20, 21 and 22. In this method, 16 is treated with either allyltributylstannane or vinyltributylstannane in the presence of a suitable a palladium catalyst such as [ 1,1' -bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), in an inert organic solvent like DMF or NMP. The reaction is usually conducted at elevated temperatures, typically between 50-100 °C, for periods of 2-24 h. In certain cases, it may be essential to use an additive such as lithium chloride to promote the reaction. Often, the reaction times can be significantly reduced if the reaction is conducted under microwave irradiation. The product of the reaction is an alkene of structural formula 20 which can be synthetically elaborated, using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis. For example, 20 can be oxidatively cleaved to afford an aldehyde of type 21, which can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid derivative of structural formula 22. A preferred method for the oxidative cleavage reaction is the two step process shown in reaction scheme F. Alkene 20 is first oxidized to a vicinal diol using catalytic osmium tetraoxide in the presence of a stoichiometric reoxidant such as NMO, in a solvent system such as acetone-water. The intermediate vicinal diol which forms is generally not isolated, but is in turn subjected to cleavage with sodium periodate in a suitable mixed solvent system like THF-water to afford 21. Both steps in the oxidative cleavage sequence are generally completed during periods of several<br>
minutes to a few hours, at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature. Alternatively, the oxidative cleavage of 20 may also be accomplished using ozone, or by other methods known to those skilled in the art. Aldehyde 21 can then be further oxidized to 22 using a buffered chlorite oxidation system, hi this method, 21 is treated with sodium chlorite and monobasic sodium phosphate in the presence of a chlorine scavenger, such as 2-methyl-2-butene. The reaction is conducted typically in a solvent system like n-butanol-water, for periods of 1-6 h, at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature. Both 21 and 22 can be elaborated in numerous ways known in organic synthesis to furnish other compounds of the present invention.<br>
Scheme F<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme G illustrates an alternative method of synthesis of compounds of structural formula 22 (n = 0). In this method, 16 is treated with methanol in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst such as [l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) and a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine, in an inert organic solvent like DMF. The reaction is usually conducted at elevated temperature, typically between 50-100 °C, for periods of 6-24 h, under an<br>
atmosphere of carbon monoxide. In certain cases it may be preferable to use elevated pressures of carbon monoxide or an additive such as lithium chloride to promote or accelerate the reaction. The product of the reaction is an ester of structural formula 16a which can be converted to 22 (n = 0) using a variety of hydrolytic methods known to those skilled in organic synthesis.<br>
Scheme G<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
Reaction scheme H illustrates the preferred method of synthesis of compounds of<br>
structural formula 24. In this method, commonly referred to as the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, 16 is treated with an aryl- or heteroaryl-boronic acid of type 23 in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst such as [ 1,1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) and aqueous sodium carbonate. The reaction is usually performed in a suitable combination of inert organic solvents such as toluene-ethanol, at about 80 °C, for a period of 6-24 h and the product is a biaryl of structural formula 24.<br>
Scheme H<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme I illustrates the synthetic methodology in the most general case in which 22 is treated with an amine of type 25 to afford an amide of structural formula 26. The amide bond coupling reaction illustrated in reaction scheme I is conducted in an appropriate inert solvent such<br>
as DMF, methylene chloride or the like and may be performed with a variety of reagents suitable for amide coupling reactions such as HATU, EDC or PyBOP. Preferred conditions for the amide bond coupling reaction shown in reaction scheme I are known to those skilled in organic synthesis. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, the use of basic reagents such as triethylamine, DBPEA, or NMM, or the addition of an additive such as HO At or HOBt. Alternatively, 25 may be treated with an activated ester or acid chloride derivative of 22, which also affords amides of structural formula 26. The amide bond coupling shown in reaction Scheme I is usually conducted at a temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature, occasionally at elevated temperatures, and the coupling reaction is typically conducted for periods of 1 to 24 h.<br>
Scheme I<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction scheme J illustrates a preferred method of synthesis of a compound of<br>
structural formula 28. In this method, 22 is subjected to the Curtius reaction to afford a N-Boc protected amine of structural formula 27. The reaction is performed by reacting 22 with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or DIPEA in a solvent like toluene. The initial product is generally accepted to be the acyl azide, which is rearranged to the isocyanate in a thermal process analogous to the Wolff rearrangement of acyl carbenes. The rearrangment is conducted typically at the reflux temperature of the solvent, for instance 110 °C, and the rearrangement is usually completed in periods of 1-5 h. The intermediate isocyanate which forms is generally not isolated, but is in turn subjected to in situ reaction with a suitable alcohol such as tert-butyl alcohol to afford amine of structural formula 27. The W-BOC group can be removed by a suitable deprotection method such as treatment with hydrogen chloride in EtOAc or TFA in methylene chloride. The deprotection is conducted typically at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature, and the reaction is usually complete in 0.5-3 h. The product amine of structural formula 28 can be used as a coupling partner in reaction Scheme K or synthetically modified using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis to afford other compounds of the present invention.<br>
Scheme J<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
Reaction scheme K illustrates preferred methods for the syntheses of compounds of structural formula 31. For example, 28 can participate in amide bond coupling reactions with a carboxylic acid of type 29 to afford an amide of structural fonnula 31, using the reagents and conditions described for the generalized amide coupling protocol shown in reaction scheme I. Alternatively, 28 may also be treated with an activated ester or acid chloride derivative of type 30, which also affords 31. Typical conditions for effecting such a transformation include treatment of 28 with 30 in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine. It is customary to perform the reaction in an inert organic solvent such as DMF or methylene chloride, at temperatures between 0 °C and the reflux temperature of the solvent, frequently at room temperature and for periods of 1-24 h.<br><br>
Scheme K<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
As shown in reaction scheme L, 28 can also be elaborated using the Fukuyama<br>
modification of the Mitsunobu reaction (Fukuyama, T.; low, C.-K.; Cheung, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6373-74). For example, 28 may be reacted with an arylsulfonyl chloride such as 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, or 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, and a tertiary amine base such as 2,4,6-collidine, or 2,6-lutidine, in an inert organic solvent such as mcthylene chloride. The product of this reaction is the sulfonamide of type 32, which can be further modified by reaction with an alcohol of type 33 in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating audit such as DEAD, DIAD, or the like. The reaction is performed in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, THF or mixtures thereof, typically at room temperature, and the reaction is generally complete in 0.5-3 h. The product of this reaction is the dialkylsulfonamide of type 34, which can be desulfonylated by treatment with either a nucleophilic amine like n-propylamine, in a solvent such as methylene chloride, or with mercaptoacetic acid and triethylamine in methylene chloride. In either case, the reaction is conducted typically at room temperature, for periods of 5 minutes to 1 hour. When a 2- or 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl derivative is employed, the cleavage of the sulfonamide is accomplished with either the combination of thiophenol and potassium carbonate in a solvent like DMF, or with mercaptoacetic acid and lithium hydroxide in DMF. In either case, the reaction is conducted at room temperature, for periods of 1-3 h. The secondary amine product of structural formula 35 can be modified further using a variety of methods known in organic synthesis to provide other compounds of the present invention. For example, 35 may be subjected to a reductive amination reaction with an aldehyde or ketone of type 36 using the conditions described in the bottom of reaction scheme L to afford compounds of type 37.<br><br>
