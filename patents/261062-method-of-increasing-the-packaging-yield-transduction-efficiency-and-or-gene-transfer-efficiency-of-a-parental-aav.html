				<td>METHOD OF INCREASING THE FUNCTION OF AN AAV VECTOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Adeno-associated virus (AAV), a member of the Parvovirus family, is a small nonenveloped, icosahedral virus with single-stranded linear DNA genomes of 4.7 kilobases (kb) to 6 kb. AAV is assigned to the genus, Dependovirus, because the virus was discovered as a contaminant in purified adenovirus stocks. AAV's life cycle includes a latent phase at which AAV genomes, after infection, are site specifically integrated into host chromosomes and an infectious phase in which, following either adenovirus or herpes simplex virus infection, the integrated genomes are subsequently rescued, replicated, and packaged into infectious viruses. The properties of non-pathogenicity, broad host range of infectivity, including non-dividing cells, and potential site-specific chromosomal integration make AAV an attractive tool for gene transfer.<br>
AAV vectors have been described for use as delivery vehicles for both therapeutic and immunogenic molecules. To date, there have been several different well-characterized AAVs isolated from human or non-human primates (NHP).<br>
Recently, investigators have described a large number of AAVs of different sequences [G. Gao, etal, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100(10):6081-6086 (May 13, 2003); US-2003-0138772-A1 (July 24, 2003)] and characterized these AAVs into different serotypes and clades [G. Gao, et al.,J. Virol, 78(12):6381-6388 (June 2004); International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/033321]. It has been reported that different AAVs exhibit different transfection efficiencies, and also exhibit tropism for different cells or tissues.<br>
What is desirable are AAV-based constructs for delivery of heterologous molecules to different cell types.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method of improving vectors derived from AAV which are non-functional and/or which perform weakly.<br>
In one aspect, the method provides a method for correcting singletons in a selected AAV sequence in order to increase the packaging yield, transduction efficiency, and/or gene transfer efficiency of the selected AAV. This method involves altering one or more singletons in the parental AAV capsid to conform the singleton to the amino acid in the corresponding position(s) of the aligned functional AAV capsid sequences.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides modified AAV sequences, i.e., sequences with one or more singletons eliminated.<br>
In yet another aspect, the invention provides AAV vectors having modified AAV capsids according to the present invention.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for improving the function of an AAV vector. The present invention is particularly well suited to improve the packaging yield, transduction efficiency, and/or gene transfer efficiency of an AAV vector having a capsid of an AAV which contains one or more singletons. The invention further provides novel AAV capsid sequences identified and prepared according to the method of the invention.<br>
As used throughout this specification and the claims, the terms "comprising" and "including" are inclusive of other components, elements, integers, steps and the like. Conversely, the term "consisting" and its variants are exclusive of other components, elements, integers, steps and the like.<br>
SINGLETON METHOD OF INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "singleton" refers to a variable amino acid in a given position in a selected (/. e., parental) AAV capsid sequence. The presence of a variable amino acid is determined by aligning the sequence of the parental AAV capsid with a library of functional AAV capsid sequences. The sequences are then analyzed to determine the presence of any variable amino acid sequences in the parental AAV capsid where the sequences of the AAV in the library of functional AAVs have complete conservation.   The parental AAV sequence is then altered to change the singleton to the conserved amino acid identified in that position in the functional AAV capsid sequences. According to the present invention, a parental AAV sequence may have 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, or 2 singletons. A parental AAV sequence may have more than 6 singletons.<br>
Once modified, the modified AAV capsid can be used to construct an AAV vector having the modified capsid. This vector can be constructed using techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The AAV selected for modification according to the invention method is one for which it is desirable to increase any one or more of the following three functional properties of AAV, i.e., packaging into the viral particle having the capsid of the selected AAV sequence, increasing transduction efficiency, or increasing gene transfer efficiency as compared to the parental AAV.   For example, the parental AAV may be characterized by having a lower packaging efficiency than other, closely related AAV. In another example, the parental AAV may have a lower transduction efficiency as compared to closely related AAVs. In another example, the parental AAV may have a lower gene transfer efficiency (i.e., a lower ability to deliver a target molecule in vivo) as compared to closely related AAVs.   In other examples, the parental AAV is characterized by adequate function in each of these categories, but increased function one or more of these areas is desired.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a library of functional AAVs, the sequences of which are to be compared to the selected (parental) AAV. Suitably, the library contains AAVs which have a desired function which is targeted for improvement in the selected parental AAV. In other words, each of the sequences in the library of functional AAVs is characterized by a desired level of packaging ability, a desired level of in vitro transduction efficiency, or a desired level of in vivo gene transfer efficiency (i.e., the ability to deliver to a target selected target tissue or cell in a subject). The functional AAVs which compose the library may individually have one, two or all of these functional characteristics. Other desired functions for the library may be readily determined by one of skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, a functional AAV is an AAV characterized by the ability to produce viral particles with equivalent or greater packaging and transduction efficiency as any one of AAV1, AAV2, AAV7, AAVS or AAV9. Function may be assessed in a pseudotyping setting with AAV2 rep and AAV2 ITRs. Thus, an altered parental AAV can be constructed using conventional techniques and the AAV vector is considered functional if virus is produced from the parental AAV at titers of at least 50% when compared to production of AAV2. Further, the ability of AAV to transduce cells can be<br>
readily determined by one of skill in the art. For example, a parental AAV can be constructed such that it contains a marker gene which allows ready detection of virus. For example, the AAV contains eGFP or another gene which allows fluorescent detection. Where the AAV contains CMV-eGFP, when the virus produced from the altered parental AAV capsid is transduced into 293 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 104, function is demonstrated where transduction efficiency is greater than 5% GFP fluorescence of total cells in a context where the cells were pretreated with wild-type human adenovirus type 5 at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 2 hours.<br>
Suitably, a library is composed of at least three or at least four functional AAV capsid sequences which represent at least two different clades. Preferably, at least two sequences from each of the represented clades is included in the library. In certain embodiments, three, four, five, six, or more clades are represented.<br>
A "clade" is a group of AAV which are phylogenetically related to one another as determined using a Neighbor-Joining algorithm by a bootstrap value of at least 75% (of at least 1000 replicates) and aPoisson correction distance measurement of no more than 0.05, based on alignment of the AAV vpl amino acid sequence.<br>
The Neighbor-Joining algorithm has been described extensively in the literature. See, e.g., M. Nei and S. Kumar, Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics (Oxford University Press, New York (2000). Computer programs are available that can be used to implement this algorithm. For example, the MEGA v2.1 program implements the modified Nei-Gojobon method. Using these techniques and computer programs, and the sequence of an AAV vpl capsid protein, one of skill in the art can readily determine whether a selected AAV is contained in one of the clades identified herein, in another clade, or is outside these clades.<br>
While the AAV clades are based primarily upon naturally occurring AAV vpl capsids, the clades are not limited to naturally occurring AAV. The clades can encompass non-naturally occurring AAV, including, without limitation, recombinant, modified or altered, chimenc, hybrid, synthetic, artificial, etc., AAV which are phylogenetically related as determined using a Neighbor-Joining algorithm at least 75% (of at least 1000 replicates) and a Poisson correction distance measurement of no more than 0.05, based on alignment of the AAV vpl amino acid sequence.<br>
The AAV clades which have been described include Clade A (represented by A AVI and AAV6), Clade B (represented by AAV2) and Clade C (represented by the AAV2-AAV3 hybrid), Clade D (represented by AAV7), Clade E (represented by AAV8), and Clade F (represented by human AAV9).   These clades are represented by a member of the clade that is a previously described AAV serotype. Previously described AAV1 and AAV6 are members of a single clade (Clade A) in which 4 isolates were recovered from 3 humans. Previously described AAV3 and AAV5 serotypes are clearly distinct from one another, but were not detected in the screen described herein, and have not been included in any of these clades.<br>
Further discussion of AAV clades is provided in G. Gao, et al, J. Virol., 78(12):6381-6388 (June 2004) and International Patent Publication Nos. WO 2004/028817 and WO2005/033321. The latter document also provides novel human AAV sequences, which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the libraries used in the method of the invention exclude AAV5. In another embodiment, the libraries used in the method of the invention exclude AAV4. However, in certain embodiments, e.g., where the parental AAV is similar to AAV5, it may be desirable to include this sequence in the alignment.<br>
Although a library can be constructed that contains the minimal number of sequences, efficiency in identifying singletons may be optimized by utilizing a library containing a larger number of sequences. Suitably, the library contains a minimum of four sequences, with at least two clades being represented. Preferably, the library contains at least two sequences from each of the represented clades. In one embodiment, the library contains more than 100 AAV sequences. In another embodiment, the library contains at least three to 100 AAV sequences. In still another embodiment, the library contains at least six to 50 AAV sequences.<br>
Suitable AAVs for use in the functional libraries of the invention include, e.g., AAV1, AAV2, AAV6, AAV7, AAVS, AAV9, and other sequences which have been described [G. Gao, etal, ProcNatl. AcadSci., 100(10):6081-6086 (May 13, 2003); International Patent Publication Nos. WO 2004/042397 and WO 2005/033321]. One of skill in the art can readily select other AAVs, e.g., those isolated using the methods described in International Patent Publication No. WO 03/093460 Al (Nov 13, 2003) and US Patent Application Publication No. 2003-0138772 Al (July 24, 2003).<br>
According to the present invention, the at least three sequences within the library are least 85% identical over the full-length of their aligned capsid sequences.<br>
The term "percent (%) identity" may be readily determined for amino acid sequences, over the full-length of a protein, or a fragment thereof. Suitably, a fragment is at least about 8 ammo acids in length, and may be up to about 700 amino acids. Generally, when referring to "identity", "homology", or "similarity" between two different adeno-associated viruses, "identity", "homology" or "similarity" is determined in reference to "aligned" sequences. "Aligned" sequences or "alignments" refer to multiple nucleic acid sequences or protein (amino acids) sequences, often containing corrections for missing or additional bases or amino acids as compared to a reference sequence.<br>
Alignments are performed using any of a variety of publicly or commercially available Multiple Sequence Alignment Programs. Sequence alignment programs are available for ammo acid sequences, e.g., the "Clustal X", "MAP", "PDVIA", "MSA", "BLOCKMAKER", "MEME", and "Match-Box" programs. Generally, any of these programs are used at default settings, although one of skill in the art can alter these settings as needed. Alternatively, one of skill in the art can utilize another algorithm or computer program which provides at least the level of identity or alignment as that provided by the referenced algorithms and programs. See, e.g., J. D. Thomson et al, Nucl. Acids. Res., "A comprehensive comparison of multiple sequence alignments", 27(13):2682-2690(1999).<br>
Multiple sequence alignment programs are also available for nucleic acid sequences. Examples of such programs include, "Clustal W", "CAP Sequence Assembly", "MAP", and "MEME", which are accessible through Web Servers on the internet. Other sources for such programs are known to those of skill in the art. Alternatively, Vector NTI utilities are also used. There are also a number of algorithms known in the art that can be used to measure nucleotlde sequence identity, including those contained in the programs described above. As another example, polynucleotide sequences can be compared using Fasta™, a program in GCG Version 6.1. Fasta™ provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences.   For instance, percent sequence identity between nucleic acid sequences can be determined using Fasta™ with its default<br>
parameters (a word size of 6 and the NOPAM factor for the scoring matrix) as provided in GCG Version 6.1, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
According to the invention, the sequences of the target or parental AAV capsid suspected of containing a singleton are compared to the sequences of the AAV capsids within the library. This comparison is performed using an alignment of the full-length vpl protein of the AAV capsid.<br>
A singleton is identified where, for a selected amino acid position when the AAV sequences are aligned, all of the AAVs in the library have the same amino acid residue (i.e., are completely conserved), but the parental AAV has a different amino acid residue.<br>
Typically, when an alignment is prepared based upon the AAV capsid vpl protein, the alignment contains insertions and deletions which are so identified with respect to a reference AAV sequence (e.g., AAV2) and the numbering of the amino acid residues is based upon a reference scale provided for the alignment. However, any given AAV sequence may have fewer amino acid residues than the reference scale. In the present invention, when discussing the parental AAV and the sequences of the reference library, the term "the same position" or the "corresponding position" refers to the amino acid located at the same residue number in each of the sequences, with respect to the reference scale for the aligned sequences. However, when taken out of the alignment, each of the AAV vpl proteins may have these amino acids located at different residue numbers.<br>
Optionally, the method of the invention can be performed using a nucleic acid alignment and identifying as a singleton a codon which encodes a different amino acid (i.e., a non-synonymous codon). Where the nucleic acid sequences of a given codon are not identical in the parental AAV as compared to the sequences of that codon in the library, but encode the same amino acid, they are considered synonymous and are not a singleton.<br>
According to the present invention, a parental AAV containing a singleton is altered such that the singleton residue is replaced with the conserved amino acid residue of the AAVs in the library.<br>
Conveniently, this replacement can be performed by using conventional site-directed mutagenesis techniques on the codon for the variable amino acid. Typically, the site-directed mutagenesis is performed using as few steps as required to obtain the desired<br>
codon for the conserved amino acid residue. Such methods are well known to those of skill in the art and can be performed using published methods and/or commercially available kits [e.g., available from Stratagene and Promega].   The site-directed mutagenesis may be performed on the AAV genomic sequence. The AAV sequence may be carried by a vector (e.g., a plasmid backbone) for convenience. Alternatively, one of skill in the art can alter the parental AAV using other techniques know to those of skill in the art.<br>
A parental AAV may have more than one singleton, e.g., two, three, four, five, six or more. However, improvement in function may be observed after correction of one singleton. In the embodiment where a parental AAV carries multiple singletons, each singleton may be altered at a time, followed by assessment of the modified AAV for enhancement of the desired function. Alternatively, multiple singletons may be altered prior to assessment for enhancement of the desired function.<br>
Even where a parental AAV contains multiple singletons and functional improvement is observed altered of a first singleton, it may be desirable to optimize function by altering the remaining singleton(s).<br>
Typically, a parental AAV which has had one or more singleton(s) altered according to the method of the invention, is assessed for function by packaging the AAV into an AAV particle. These methods are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., G. Gao et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci., cited above; Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor NY.<br>
These altered AAVs have novel capsids produced according to the method of the invention and are assessed for function. Suitable methods for assessing AAV function have been described herein and include, e.g., the ability to produce DNAse protected particles, in vitro cell transduction efficiency, and/or in vivo gene transfer. Suitably, the altered AAVs of the invention have a sufficient number of singletons altered to increase function in one or all of these characteristics, as compared to the function of the parent AAV.<br>
II.        Novel AAV of the Invention<br>
The invention further provides a method of predicting whether a novel AAV will be functional. The method involves using the singleton method of the invention and<br>
identifying the absence of a singleton in the sequence of the selected AAV, i.e., an AAV which lacks a singleton.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method of selecting an AAV for use in producing a vector. This method involves selecting a parental AAV capsid sequence for analysis and identifying the absence of any singletons in the parental AAV capsid in an alignment comprising the parental AAV capsid sequence and a library of functional AAV capsid sequences. Once the absence of a singleton in a selected AAV capsid is determined, the AAV can be used to generate a vector according to known techniques.<br>
The term "substantial homology" or "substantial similarity," when referring to a nucleic acid, or fragment thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate nucleotide insertions or deletions with another nucleic acid (or its complementary strand), there is nucleotide sequence identity in at least about 95 to 99% of the aligned sequences. Preferably, the homology is over full-length sequence, or an open reading frame thereof, or another suitable fragment which is at least 15 nucleotides in length. Examples of suitable fragments are described herein.<br>
The terms "sequence identity", "percent sequence identity", or "percent identical" in the context of nucleic acid sequences refers to the residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence. The length of sequence identity comparison may be over the full-length of the genome, the full-length of a gene coding sequence, or a fragment of at least about 500 to 5000 nucleotides, is desired. However, identity among smaller fragments, e.g. of at least about nine nucleotides, usually at least about 20 to 24 nucleotides, at least about 28 to 32 nucleotides, at least about 36 or more nucleotides, may also be desired.<br>
The term "substantial homology" or "substantial similarity," when referring to ammo acids or fragments thereof, indicates that, when optimally aligned with appropriate ammo acid insertions or deletions with another amino acid (or its complementary strand), there is amino acid sequence identity in at least about 95 to about 99% of the aligned sequences and in certain embodiments, about 97% of the aligned sequences. Preferably, the homology is over full-length sequence, or a protein thereof, e.g., a cap protein, a rep protein, or a fragment thereof which is at least 8 amino acids, or more desirably, at least 15 amino acids in length. Examples of suitable fragments are described herein.<br>
By the term "highly conserved" is meant at least 80% identity, preferably at least 90% identity, and more preferably, over 97% identity. Identity is readily determined by one of skill in the art by resort to algorithms and computer programs known by those of skill in the art.<br>
The term "serotype" is a distinction with respect to an AAV having a capsid which is serologically distinct from other AAV serotypes. Serologic distinctiveness is determined on the basis of the lack of cross-reactivity between antibodies to the AAV as compared to other AAV.   Cross-reactivity is typically measured in a neutralizing antibody assay. For this assay polyclonal serum is generated against a specific AAV in a rabbit or other suitable animal model using the adeno-associated viruses. In this assay, the serum generated against a specific AAV is then tested in its ability to neutralize either the same (homologous) or a heterologous AAV. The dilution that achieves 50% neutralization is considered the neutralizing antibody titer. If for two AAVs the quotient of the heterologous titer divided by the homologous titer is lower than 16 in a reciprocal manner, those two vectors are considered as the same serotype. Conversely, if the ratio of the heterologous titer over the homologous titer is 16 or more in a reciprocal manner the two AAVs are considered distinct serotypes.<br>
In a further embodiment, the invention provides AAV having novel capsids, including rh. 20, rh.32/33, rh.39, rh.46, rh.73, and rh.74. The sequences of rh.20 have the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, or a sequence 95 to 99% identical over the full-length of SEQ ID NO: 1. The capsid of rh.32/33 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, or sequences 95% to 99% identical thereto over the full-length of SEQ ID NO:2. The capsid of rh.39 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3, or sequences 95% to 99% identical thereto over the full-length of SEQ ID NO:3. The capsid of rh.46 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:4, or sequences 95% to 99% identical thereto over the full-length of SEQ ID N0:4. The capsid of rh.73 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:5, or sequences 95% to 99% identical thereto over the full-length of SEQ ID NO:5. The capsid of rh.74 has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6, or sequences 95% to 99% identical thereto over the full-length of SEQ ID NO:6. Preferably, the sequence identity of these novel AAV capsids is such that it lacks any singletons. The sequences of the novel AAV are provided in the Sequence Listing.<br>
In still another embodiment, the novel AAV sequences of the invention include the singleton-corrected AAV capsid proteins and the sequences encoding these capsid proteins. Examples of suitable singleton-correct AAV sequences include, AAV6.1, AAV6.2, AAV6.1.2, rh.SR, rh.48.1, rh.48.2, rh.48.1.2, hu.44Rl, hu.44R2 hu.44R3, hu.29R, ch.5Rl, rh.67, rh.54, hu.48Rl, hu.48R2, and hu.48R3. For example, the singleton-corrected AAV6, including AAV6.1, AAV6.2 and AAV6.12 have shown significant functional improvement over the parental AAV6 sequence.<br>
Particularly desirable proteins include the AAV capsid proteins, which are encoded by the nucleotide sequences identified above. The AAV capsid is composed of three proteins, vpl, vp2 and vp3, which are alternative splice variants. Other desirable fragments of the capsid protein include the constant and variable regions, located between hypervariable regions (HVR). Other desirable fragments of the capsid protein include the HVR themselves.<br>
An algorithm developed to determine areas of sequence divergence in AAV2 has yielded 12 hypervariable regions (HVR) of which 5 overlap or are part of the four previously described variable regions. [Chiorim et al, J. Virol, 73:1309-19 (1999); Rutledge et al, J. Virol., 72:309-319] Using this algorithm and/or the alignment techniques described herein, the HVR of the novel AAV serotypes are determined.   For example, the HVR are located as follows: HVR1, aa 146-152; HVR2, aa 182-186; HVR3, aa 262-264; HVR4, aa 381-383; HVR5, aa 450-474; HVR6, aa 490-495; HVR7, aa 500-504; HVR8, aa 514-522; HVR9, aa 534-555; HVR10, aa 581-594; HVR11, aa 658-667; and HVR12, aa 705-719 [the numbering system is based on an alignment which uses the AAV2 vpl as a point of reference]. Using the alignment provided herein performed using the Clustal X program at default settings, or using other commercially or publicly available alignment programs at default settings such as are described herein, one of skill in the art can readily determine corresponding fragments of the novel AAV capsids of the invention.<br>
Suitably, fragments are at least 8 ammo acids in length. However, fragments of other desired lengths may be readily utilized. Such fragments may be produced recombinantly or by other suitable means, e.g., by chemical synthesis.<br>
The invention further provides other AAV sequences which are identified using the sequence information provided herein. For example, given the sequences provided<br>
herein, infectious may be isolated using genome walking technology (Siebert et al, 1995, Nucleic Acid Research, 23:1087-1088, Fnezner-Degen etal., 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261:6972-6985, BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).   Genome walking is particularly well suited for identifying and isolating the sequences adjacent to the novel sequences identified according to the method of the invention. This technique is also useful for isolating inverted terminal repeat (ITRs) of the novel AAV, based upon the novel AAV capsid and rep sequences provided herein.<br>
The novel AAV amino acid sequences, peptides and proteins may be expressed from AAV nucleic acid sequences of the invention. Additionally, these amino acid sequences, peptides and proteins can be generated by other methods known in the art, including, e.g., by chemical synthesis, by other synthetic techniques, or by other methods. The sequences of any of the AAV capsids provided herein can be readily generated using a variety of techniques.<br>
Suitable production techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Alternatively, peptides can also be synthesized by the well-known solid phase peptide synthesis methods (Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85:2149 (1962); Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (Freeman, San Francisco, 1969) pp. 27-62). These and other suitable production methods are within the knowledge of those of skill in the art and are not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
The sequences, proteins, and fragments of the invention may be produced by any suitable means, including recombinant production, chemical synthesis, or other synthetic means. Such production methods are within the knowledge of those of skill in the art and are not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
III.       Production of rAAV with Novel AAV Capsids<br>
The invention encompasses novel AAV capsid sequences generated by mutation following use of the method of the invention for identifying singletons. The invention further encompasses the novel AAV rh.20, rh.32/33, rh.39, rh.46, rh.73, and rh.74 capsid sequences [SEQ ID Nos: 1-6].<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides molecules that utilize the novel AAV sequences of the invention, including fragments thereof, for production of viral<br>
vectors useful in delivery of a heterologous gene or other nucleic acid sequences to a target cell.<br>
The molecules of the invention which contain AAV sequences include any genetic element (vector) which may be delivered to a host cell, e.g., naked DNA, a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, episome, a protein in a non-viral delivery vehicle (e.g., a lipid-based carrier), virus, etc., which transfers the sequences carried thereon.<br>
The selected vector may be delivered by any suitable method, including transfection, electroporation, liposome delivery, membrane fusion techniques, high velocity DNA-coated pellets, viral infection and protoplast fusion.   The methods used to construct any embodiment of this invention are known to those with skill in nucleic acid manipulation and include genetic engineering, recombinant engineering, and synthetic techniques. See, e.g., Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.<br>
In one embodiment, the vectors of the invention contain, inter alia, sequences encoding an AAV capsid of the invention or a fragment thereof. In another embodiment, the vectors of the invention contain, at a minimum, sequences encoding an AAV rep protein or a fragment thereof. Optionally, vectors of the invention may contain both AAV cap and rep proteins. In vectors in which both AAV rep and cap are provided, the AAV rep and AAV cap sequences can originate from an AAV of the same clade. Alternatively, the present invention provides vectors in which the rep sequences are from an AAV source which differs from that which is providing the cap sequences. In one embodiment, the rep and cap sequences are expressed from separate sources (e.g., separate vectors, or a host cell and a vector). In another embodiment, these rep sequences are fused in frame to cap sequences of a different AAV source to form a chimeric AAV vector. Optionally, the vectors of the invention are vectors packaged in an AAV capsid of the invention. These vectors and other vectors described herein can further contain a minigene comprising a selected transgene which is flanked by AAV 5' ITR and AAV 3' ITR.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the vectors described herein contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an intact AAV capsid which may be from a single AAV sequence . Alternatively, these vectors contain sequences encoding artificial capsids which contain one or more fragments of the singleton-corrected AAV capsid fused to heterologous AAV<br>
or non-AAV capsid proteins (or fragments thereof). These artificial capsid proteins are selected from non-contiguous portions of the singleton-corrected capsid or from capsids of other AAVs. These modifications may be to increase expression, yield, and/or to improve purification in the selected expression systems, or for another desired purpose (e.g., to change tropism or alter neutralizing antibody epitopes).<br>
The vectors described herein, e.g., aplasmid, are useful for a variety of purposes, but are particularly well suited for use in production of a r AAV containing a capsid comprising AAV sequences or a fragment thereof. These vectors, including rAAV, their elements, construction, and uses are described in detail herein.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a method of generating a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) having a novel AAV capsid of the invention. Such a method involves culturing a host cell which contains a nucleic acid sequence encoding a novel AAV capsid protein of the invention, or fragment thereof, as defined herein; a functional rep gene; a minigene composed of, at a minimum, AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and a transgene; and sufficient helper functions to permit packaging of the minigene into the AAV capsid protein.<br>
The components required to be cultured in the host cell to package an AAV minigene in an AAV capsid may be provided to the host cell in trans. Alternatively, one or more of the required components (e.g., minigene, rep sequences, cap sequences, and/or helper functions) may be provided by a stable host cell which has been engineered to contain one or more of the required components using methods known to those of skill in the art. Most suitably, such a stable host cell will contain the required component(s) under the control of an inducible promoter. However, the required component(s) may be under the control of a constitutive promoter. Examples of suitable inducible and constitutive promoters are provided herein, in the discussion of regulatory elements suitable for use with the transgene. In still another alternative, a selected stable host cell may contain selected component(s) under the control of a constitutive promoter and other selected component(s) under the control of one or more inducible promoters. For example, a stable host cell may be generated which is derived from 293 cells (which contain El helper functions under the control of a constitutive promoter), but which contains the rep and/or cap proteins under the control of inducible promoters. Still other stable host cells may be generated by one of skill in the art.<br>
The mmigene, rep sequences, cap sequences, and helper functions required for producing the rAAV of the invention may be delivered to the packaging host cell in the form of any genetic element which transfer the sequences carried thereon. The selected genetic element may be delivered by any suitable method, including those described herein. The methods used to construct any embodiment of this invention are known to those with skill in nucleic acid manipulation and include genetic engineering, recombinant engineering, and synthetic techniques. See, e.g., Sambrook et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. Similarly, methods of generating rAAV virions are well known and the selection of a suitable method is not a limitation on the present invention. See, e.g., K. Fisher et al, J. Virol, 70:520-532 (1993) and US Patent No. 5,478,745.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the AAV ITRs, and other selected AAV components described herein, may be readily selected from among any AAV, including, without limitation, AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV9 and one of the other novel AAV sequences of the invention. These ITRs or other AAV components may be readily isolated using techniques available to those of skill in the art from an AAV sequence. Such AAV may be isolated or obtained from academic, commercial, or public sources (e.g., the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). Alternatively, the AAV sequences may be obtained through synthetic or other suitable means by reference to published sequences such as are available in the literature or in databases such as, e.g., GenBank®, PubMed®, or the like. A.       The Minigene<br>
The mmigene is composed of, at a minimum, a transgene and its regulatory sequences, and 5' and 3' AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). In one desirable embodiment, the ITRs of AAV serotype 2 are used. However, ITRs from other suitable sources may be selected. It is this minigene that is packaged into a capsid protein and delivered to a selected host cell.<br>
1.       The transgene<br>
The transgene is a nucleic acid sequence, heterologous to the<br>
vector sequences flanking the transgene, which encodes a polypeptide, protein, or other product, of interest. The nucleic acid coding sequence is operatively linked to regulatory<br>
components in a manner which permits transgene transcription, translation, and/or expression in a host cell.<br>
The composition of the transgene sequence will depend upon the use to which the resulting vector will be put. For example, one type of transgene sequence includes a reporter sequence, which upon expression produces a detectable signal. Such reporter sequences include, without limitation, DNA sequences encoding P-lactamase, p-galactosidase (LacZ), alkaline phosphatase, thymidme kinase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), enhanced GFP (EGFP), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), luciferase, membrane bound proteins including, for example, CD2, CD4, CDS, the influenza hemagglutmin protein, and others well known in the art, to which high affinity antibodies directed thereto exist or can be produced by conventional means, and fusion proteins comprising a membrane bound protein appropriately fused to an antigen tag domain from, among others, hemagglutinin or Myc.<br>
These coding sequences, when associated with regulatory<br>
elements which drive their expression, provide signals detectable by conventional means, including enzymatic, radiographic, colorimetric, fluorescence or other spectrographic assays, fluorescent activating cell sorting assays and immunological assays, including enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochermstry. For example, where the marker sequence is the LacZ gene, the presence of the vector carrying the signal is detected by assays for beta-galactosidase activity. Where the transgene is green fluorescent protein or luciferase, the vector carrying the signal may be measured visually by color or light production in a luminometer.<br>
However, desirably, the transgene is a non-marker sequence<br>
encoding a product which is useful in biology and medicine, such as proteins, peptides, RNA, enzymes, dominant negative mutants, or catalytic RNAs.   Desirable RNA molecules include tRNA, dsRNA, ribosomal RNA, catalytic RNAs, siRNA, small hairpin RNA, trans-splicing RNA, and antisense RNAs.   One example of a useful RNA sequence is a sequence which inhibits or extinguishes expression of a targeted nucleic acid sequence in the treated animal. Typically, suitable target sequences include oncologic targets and viral diseases. See, for examples of such targets the oncologic targets and viruses identified below in the section relating to immunogens.<br>
The transgene may be used to correct or ameliorate gene<br>
deficiencies, which may include deficiencies in which normal genes are expressed at less than normal levels or deficiencies in which the functional gene product is not expressed. Alternatively, the transgene may provide a product to a cell which is not natively expressed in the cell type or in the host, A preferred type of transgene sequence encodes a therapeutic protein or polypeptide which is expressed in a host cell. The invention further includes using multiple transgenes. In certain situations, a different transgene may be used to encode each subunit of a protein, or to encode different peptides or proteins. This is desirable when the size of the DNA encoding the protein subunit is large, e.g., for an immunoglobulin, the platelet-derived growth factor, or a dystrophin protein. In order for the cell to produce the multi-subunit protein, a cell is infected with the recombinant virus containing each of the different subunits. Alternatively, different subunits of a protein may be encoded by the same transgene. In this case, a single transgene includes the DNA encoding each of the subunits, with the DNA for each subunit separated by an internal ribozyme entry site (IRES). This is desirable when the size of the DNA encoding each of the subunits is small, e.g., the total size of the DNA encoding the subunits and the IRES is less than five kilobases. As an alternative to an IRES, the DNA may be separated by sequences encoding a 2A peptide, which self-cleaves in apost-translational event. See, e.g., M.L. Donnelly, etal,J. Gen. Virol, 78(Pt 1):13-21 (Jan 1997); Furler, S., etal, Gene 7%er.,8(ll):864-873 (June 2001); Klump H., etal., Gene Ther., 8(10):811-817 (May 2001). This 2A peptide is significantly smaller than an IRES, making it well suited for use when space is a limiting factor. More often, when the transgene is large, consists of multi-subunits, or two transgenes are co-delivered, rAAV carrying the desired transgene(s) or subunits are co-administered to allow them to concatamerize in vivo to form a single vector genome. In such an embodiment, a first AAV may carry an expression cassette which expresses a single transgene and a second AAV may carry an expression cassette which expresses a different transgene for co-expression in the host cell. However, the selected transgene may encode any biologically active product or other product, e.g., a product desirable for study.<br>
Suitable transgenes may be readily selected by one of skill in the art. The selection of the transgene is not considered to be a limitation of this invention.<br>
2.        Regulatory Elements<br>
In addition to the major elements identified above for the<br>
minigene, the vector also includes conventional control elements which are operably linked to the transgene in a manner which permits its transcription, translation and/or expression in a cell transfected with the plasmid vector or infected with the virus produced by the invention   As used herein, "operably linked" sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest.<br>
Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation (polyA) signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e., Kozak consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance secretion of the encoded product. A great number of expression control sequences, including promoters which are native, constitutive, inducible and/or tissue-specific, are known in the art and may be utilized.<br>
Examples of constitutive promoters include, without limitation, the retroviral Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR promoter (optionally with the RSV enhancer), the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (optionally with the CMV enhancer) [see, e.g., Boshart etal, Cell, 41:521-530 (1985)], the SV40 promoter, the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, the p-actm promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EF1 promoter [Invitrogen], Inducible promoters allow regulation of gene expression and can be regulated by exogenously supplied compounds, environmental factors such as temperature, or the presence of a specific physiological state, e.g., acute phase, a particular differentiation state of the cell, or in replicating cells only.   Inducible promoters and inducible systems are available from a variety of commercial sources, including, without limitation, Invitrogen, Clontech and Ariad. Many other systems have been described and can be readily selected by one of skill in the art. Examples of inducible promoters regulated by exogenously supplied compounds, include, the zinc-inducible sheep metallothionine (MT) promoter, the dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, the TV polymerase promoter system [International Patent Publication No. WO 98/10088]; the ecdysone insect promoter [No et<br>
al,Proc. Nail Acad. Sci. USA, 93:3346-3351 (1996)], the tetracyclme-repressible system [Gossen etal, Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5547-5551 (1992)], the tetracyclme-inducible system [Gossen el al, Science, 268:1766-1769 (1995), see also Harvey etal, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol, 2:512-518 (1998)], the RU486-inducible system [Wang etal, Nal. Biotech., 15:239-243 (1997) and Wang el al, Gene Ther., 4:432-441 (1997)] and the rapamycin-inducible system [Magari el al, J. Clin. Invest, 100:2865-2872 (1997)]. Other types of mducible promoters which may be useful in this context are those which are regulated by a specific physiological state, e.g., temperature, acute phase, a particular differentiation state of the cell, or in replicating cells only.<br>
In another embodiment, the native promoter for the transgene will be used. The native promoter may be preferred when it is desired that expression of the transgene should mimic the native expression. The native promoter may be used when expression of the transgene must be regulated temporally or develop mentally, or in a tissue-specific manner, or in response to specific transcriptional stimuli. In a further embodiment, other native expression control elements, such as enhancer elements, polyadenylation sites or Kozak consensus sequences may also be used to mimic the native expression.<br>
Another embodiment of the transgene includes a gene operably linked to a tissue-specific promoter. For instance, if expression in skeletal muscle is desired, a promoter active in muscle should be used. These include the promoters from genes encoding skeletal p-actin, myosin light chain 2A, dystrophin, muscle creatine kinase, as well as synthetic muscle promoters with activities higher than naturally-occurring promoters (see Li elal,Nal. Biotech., 17:241-245 (1999)). Examples of promoters that are tissue-specific are known for liver (albumin, Miyatake el al, J. Virol, 71:5124-32 (1997); hepatitis B virus core promoter, Sandig etal., Gene Ther., 3:1002-9 (1996); alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Arbuthnot el al., Hum. Gene Ther., 7:1503-14 (1996)), bone osteocalcin (Stein el al.,Mol. Biol. Rep., 24:185-96 (1997)); bone sialoprotein (Chen etal.,J. Bone Miner. Res., 11:654-64 (1996)), lymphocytes (CD2, Hansal etal.,J. Immunol, 161:1063-8 (1998); immunoglobulin heavy chain; T cell receptor chain), neuronal such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter (Andersen el al, Cell. Mol Neurobiol, 13:503-15 (1993)), neurofilament light-chain gene (Piccioli etal, Proc. Nail<br>
Acad. Sci. USA, 88:5611-5 (1991)), and the neuron-specific vgf gene (Piccioli et al, Neuron, 15:373-84 (1995)), among others.<br>
Optionally, plasmids carrying therapeutically useful transgenes<br>
may also include selectable markers or reporter genes may include sequences encoding geneticm, hygromicin or purimycin resistance, among others. Such selectable reporters or marker genes (preferably located outside the viral genome to be rescued by the method of the invention) can be used to signal the presence of the plasmids in bacterial cells, such as ampicillin resistance. Other components of the plasmid may include an origin of replication. Selection of these and other promoters and vector elements are conventional and many such sequences are available [see, e.g., Sambrook et al, and references cited therein],<br>
The combination of the transgene, promoter/enhancer, and 5' and 3' AAV ITRs is referred to as a "minigene" for ease of reference herein. Provided with the teachings of this invention, the design of such a minigene can be made by resort to conventional techniques.<br>
3.        Delivery of the Minigene to a Packaging Host Cell<br>
The minigene can be carried on any suitable vector, e.g., a<br>
plasmid, which is delivered to a host cell.   The plasmids useful in this invention may be engineered such that they are suitable for replication and, optionally, integration in prokaryotic cells, mammalian cells, or both.   These plasmids (or other vectors carrying the 5' AAV ITR-heterologous molecule-3' AAV ITR) contain sequences permitting replication of the minigene in eukaryotes and/or prokaryotes and selection markers for these systems. Selectable markers or reporter genes may include sequences encoding geneticin, hygromicin or purimycin resistance, among others. The plasmids may also contain certain selectable reporters or marker genes that can be used to signal the presence of the vector in bacterial cells, such as ampicillin resistance. Other components of the plasmid may include an origin of replication and an amplicon, such as the amplicon system employing the Epstein Barr virus nuclear antigen. This amplicon system, or other similar amplicon components permit high copy episomal replication in the cells. Preferably, the molecule carrying the minigene is transfected into the cell, where it may exist transiently. Alternatively, the minigene (carrying the 5' AAV ITR-heterologous molecule-3' ITR) may be stably integrated into the genome of the host cell, either<br>
chromosomally or as an episome. In certain embodiments, the minigene may be present in multiple copies, optionally in head-to-head, head-to-tail, or tail-to-tail concatamers. Suitable transfection techniques are known and may readily be utilized to deliver the minigene to the host cell.<br>
Generally, when delivering the vector comprising the minigene by transfection, the vector is delivered in an amount from about 5 ug to about 100 ug DNA, about 10 ug to about 50 ug DNA to about 1 x 104 cells to about 1 x 1013 cells, or about 1 x 105 cells. However, the relative amounts of vector DNA to host cells may be adjusted by one of ordinary skill in the art, who may take into consideration such factors as the selected vector, the delivery method and the host cells selected. B.       Rep and Cap Sequences<br>
In addition to the minigene, the host cell contains the sequences which drive expression of a novel AAV capsid protein of the invention (or a capsid protein comprising a fragment thereof) in the host cell and rep sequences of the same source as the source of the AAV ITRs found in the minigene, or a cross-complementing source. The AAV cap and rep sequences may be independently obtained from an AAV source as described above and may be introduced into the host cell in any manner known to one in the art as described above. Additionally, when pseudotyping an AAV vector, the sequences encoding each of the essential rep proteins may be supplied by different AAV sources (e.g., AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9). For example, the re/?78/68 sequences may be from AAV2, whereas the rep52/40 sequences may be from AAV8.<br>
In one embodiment, the host cell stably contains the capsid protein under the control of a suitable promoter, such as those described above. Most desirably, in this embodiment, the capsid protein is expressed under the control of an inducible promoter. In another embodiment, the capsid protein is supplied to the host cell in trans. When delivered to the host cell in trans, the capsid protein may be delivered via a plasmid which contains the sequences necessary to direct expression of the selected capsid protein in the host cell. Most desirably, when delivered to the host cell in trans, the plasmid carrying the capsid protein also carries other sequences required for packaging the rAAV, e.g., the rep sequences.<br>
In another embodiment, the host cell stably contains the rep sequences under the control of a suitable promoter, such as those described above. Most desirably, in this embodiment, the essential rep proteins are expressed under the control of an inducible promoter. In another embodiment, the rep proteins are supplied to the host cell in trans. When delivered to the host cell in trans, the rep proteins may be delivered via a plasmid which contains the sequences necessary to direct expression of the selected rep proteins in the host cell. Most desirably, when delivered to the host cell in trans, the plasmid carrying the capsid protein also carries other sequences required for packaging the rAAV, e.g., the rep and cap sequences.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the rep and cap sequences may be transfected into the host cell on a single nucleic acid molecule and exist stably in the cell as an episome. In another embodiment, the rep and cap sequences are stably integrated into the chromosome of the cell. Another embodiment has the rep and cap sequences transiently expressed in the host cell. For example, a useful nucleic acid molecule for such transfection comprises, from 5' to 3', a promoter, an optional spacer interposed between the promoter and the start site of the rep gene sequence, an AAV rep gene sequence, and an AAV cap gene sequence.<br>
Optionally, the rep and/or cap sequences may be supplied on a vector that contains other DNA sequences that are to be introduced into the host cells. For instance, the vector may contain the rAAV construct comprising the minigene. The vector may comprise one or more of the genes encoding the helper functions, e.g., the adenoviral proteins El, E2a, and E4 ORF6, and the gene for VAIRNA.<br>
Preferably, the promoter used in this construct may be any of the constitutive, inducible or native promoters known to one of skill in the art or as discussed above. In one embodiment, an AAV P5 promoter sequence is employed.   The selection of the AAV to provide any of these sequences does not limit the invention.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the promoter for rep is an inducible promoter, such as are discussed above in connection with the transgene regulatory elements.   One preferred promoter for rep expression is the T7 promoter. The vector comprising the rep gene regulated by the T7 promoter and the cap gene, is transfected or transformed into a cell which either constitutively or inducibly expresses the TV<br>
polymerase. See International Patent Publication No. WO 98/10088, published March 12, 1998.<br>
The spacer is an optional element in the design of the vector. The spacer is a DNA sequence interposed between the promoter and the rep gene ATG start site. The spacer may have any desired design; that is, it may be a random sequence of nucleotides, or alternatively, it may encode a gene product, such as a marker gene. The spacer may contain genes which typically incorporate start/stop and polyA sites. The spacer may be a non-coding DNA sequence from a prokaryote or eukaryote, a repetitive non-coding sequence, a coding sequence without transcriptional controls or a coding sequence with transcriptional controls. Two exemplary sources of spacer sequences are the  phage ladder sequences or yeast ladder sequences, which are available commercially, e.g., from Gibco or Invitrogen, among others. The spacer may be of any size sufficient to reduce expression of the rep78 and rep68 gene products, leaving the rep52, rep40 and cap gene products expressed at normal levels. The length of the spacer may therefore range from about 10 bp to about 10.0 kbp, preferably in the range of about 100 bp to about 8.0 kbp. To reduce the possibility of recombination, the spacer is preferably less than 2 kbp in length; however, the invention is not so limited.<br>
Although the molecule(s) providing rep and cap may exist in the host cell transiently (i.e., through transfection), it is preferred that one or both of the rep and cap proteins and the promoter(s) controlling their expression be stably expressed in the host cell, e.g., as an episome or by integration into the chromosome of the host cell. The methods employed for constructing embodiments of this invention are conventional genetic engineering or recombinant engineering techniques such as those described in the references above. While this specification provides illustrative examples of specific constructs, using the information provided herein, one of skill in the art may select and design other suitable constructs, using a choice of spacers, P5 promoters, and other elements, including at least one translational start and stop signal, and the optional addition of polyadenylation sites.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the rep or cap protein may be provided stably by a host cell.<br><br>
C.       The Helper Functions<br>
The packaging host cell also requires helper functions in order to package the rAAV of the invention. Optionally, these functions may be supplied by a herpesvirus. Most desirably, the necessary helper functions are each provided from a human or non-human primate adenovirus source, such as those described above and/or are available from a variety of sources, including the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA (US). In one currently preferred embodiment, the host cell is provided with and/or contains an Ela gene product, an Elb gene product, an E2a gene product, and/or an E4 ORF6 gene product. The host cell may contain other adenoviral genes such as VAI UNA, but these genes are not required. In a preferred embodiment, no other adenovirus genes or gene functions are present in the host cell.<br>
By "adenoviral DNA which expresses the Ela gene product", it is meant any adenovirus sequence encoding Ela or any functional Ela portion. Adenoviral DNA which expresses the E2a gene product and adenoviral DNA which expresses the E4 ORF6 gene products are defined similarly. Also included are any alleles or other modifications of the adenoviral gene or functional portion thereof. Such modifications may be deliberately introduced by resort to conventional genetic engineering or mutagenic techniques to enhance the adenoviral function in some manner, as well as naturally occurring allelic variants thereof. Such modifications and methods for manipulating DNA to achieve these adenovirus gene functions are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The adenovirus Ela, Elb, E2a, and/or E40RF6 gene products, as well as any other desired helper functions, can be provided using any means that allows their expression in a cell. Each of the sequences encoding these products may be on a separate vector, or one or more genes may be on the same vector. The vector may be any vector known in the art or disclosed above, including plasmids, cosmids and viruses. Introduction into the host cell of the vector may be achieved by any means known in the art or as disclosed above, including transfection, infection, electroporation, liposome delivery, membrane fusion techniques, high velocity DNA-coated pellets, viral infection and protoplast fusion, among others. One or more of the adenoviral genes may be stably integrated into the genome of the host cell, stably expressed as episomes, or expressed<br>
transiently. The gene products may all be expressed transiently, on an episome or stably integrated, or some of the gene products may be expressed stably while others are expressed transiently. Furthermore, the promoters for each of the adenoviral genes may be selected independently from a constitutive promoter, an inducible promoter or a native adenoviral promoter. The promoters may be regulated by a specific physiological state of the organism or cell (i.e., by the differentiation state or in replicating or quiescent cells) or by other means, e.g., by exogenously added factors.<br>
D.       Host Cells And Packaging Cell Lines<br>
The host cell itself may be selected from any biological organism, including prokaryotic (e.g., bacterial) cells, and eukaryotic cells, including, insect cells, yeast cells and mammalian cells. Particularly desirable host cells are selected from among any mammalian species, including, without limitation, cells such as A549, WEHI, 3T3, 10T1/2, BHK, MDCK, COS 1, COS 7, BSC 1, BSC 40, BMT 10, VERO, WI38, HeLa, 293 cells (which express functional adenoviral El), Saos, C2C12, L cells, HT1080, HepG2 and primary fibroblast, hepatocyte and myoblast cells derived from mammals including human, monkey, mouse, rat, rabbit, and hamster. The selection of the mammalian species providing the cells is not a limitation of this invention; nor is the type of mammalian cell, i. e., fibroblast, hepatocyte, tumor cell, etc. The requirements for the cell used is that it not carry any adenovirus gene other than El, E2a and/or E4 ORF6; it not contain any other virus gene which could result in homologous recombination of a contaminating virus during the production of rAAV; and it is capable of infection or transfection of DNA and expression of the transfected DNA. In a preferred embodiment, the host cell is one that has rep and cap stably transfected in the cell.<br>
One host cell useful in the present invention is a host cell stably<br>
transformed with the sequences encoding rep and cap, and which is transfected with the adenovirus El, E2a, and E4ORF6 DNA and a construct carrying the minigene as described above. Stable rep and/or cap expressing cell lines, such as B-50 (International Patent Application Publication No. WO 99/15685), or those described in US Patent No. 5,658,785, may also be similarly employed. Another desirable host cell contains the minimum adenoviral DNA which is sufficient to express E4 ORF6. Yet other cell lines can be constructed using the novel singleton-corrected AAV cap sequences of the invention.<br>
The preparation of a host cell according to this invention involves techniques such as assembly of selected DNA sequences. This assembly may be accomplished utilizing conventional techniques. Such techniques include cDNA and genomic cloning, which are well known and are described in Sambrook et al., cited above, use of overlapping oligonucleotide sequences of the adenovirus and AAV genomes, combined with polymerase chain reaction, synthetic methods, and any other suitable methods which provide the desired nucleotide sequence.<br>
Introduction of the molecules (as plasmids or viruses) into the host cell may also be accomplished using techniques known to the skilled artisan and as discussed throughout the specification. In preferred embodiment, standard transfection techniques are used, e.g., CaP04 transfection or electroporation, and/or infection by hybrid adenovirus/AAV vectors into cell lines such as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 (a human kidney cell line containing functional adenovirus El genes which provides trans-acting El proteins).<br>
One of skill in the art will readily understand that the novel AAV sequences of the invention can be readily adapted for use in these and other viral vector systems for in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo gene delivery. Similarly, one of skill in the art can readily select other fragments of the AAV genome of the invention for use in a variety of rAAV and non-rAAV vector systems. Such vectors systems may include, e.g., lentiviruses, retroviruses, poxviruses, vaccinia viruses, and adenoviral systems, among others. Selection of these vector systems is not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the invention further provides vectors generated using the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the novel AAV of the invention. Such vectors are useful for a variety of purposes, including for delivery of therapeutic molecules and for use in vaccine regimens. Particularly desirable for delivery of therapeutic molecules are recombinant AAV containing capsids of the novel AAV of the invention. These, or other vector constructs containing novel AAV sequences of the invention may be used in vaccine regimens, e.g., for co-delivery of a cytokine, or for delivery of the immunogen itself.<br>
IV.      Recombinant Viruses And Uses Therefor<br>
Using the techniques described herein, one of skill in the art can generate a rAAV having a capsid of an AAV of the invention or having a capsid containing one or more fragments of an AAV of the invention. In one embodiment, a full-length capsid from a singleton-corrected AAV can be utilized. A.       Delivery of Viruses<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for delivery of a transgene to a host which involves transfecting or infecting a selected host cell with a recombinant viral vector generated with the singleton-corrected AAV (or functional fragments thereof) of the invention. Methods for delivery are well known to those of skill in the art and are not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
In one desirable embodiment, the invention provides a method for AAV-mediated delivery of a transgene to a host. This method involves transfecting or infecting a selected host cell with a recombinant viral vector containing a selected transgene under the control of sequences that direct expression thereof and the modified capsid proteins of the capsids.<br>
Optionally, a sample from the host may be first assayed for the presence of antibodies to a selected AAV source (e.g., a serotype). A variety of assay formats for detecting neutralizing antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. The selection of such an assay is not a limitation of the present invention. See, e.g., Fisher et al, Nature Med, 3(3):306-312 (March 1997) and W. C. Manning et al, Human Gene Therapy, 9:477-485 (March 1, 1998). The results of this assay may be used to determine which AAV vector containing capsid proteins of a particular source are preferred for delivery, e.g., by the absence of neutralizing antibodies specific for that capsid source.<br>
In one aspect of this method, the delivery of vector with AAV capsid proteins of the invention may precede or follow delivery of a gene via a vector with a different AAV capsid protein. Thus, gene delivery via rAAV vectors may be used for repeat gene delivery to a selected host cell. Desirably, subsequently administered rAAV vectors carry the same transgene as the first rAAV vector, but the subsequently administered vectors contain capsid proteins of sources (and preferably, different serotypes) which differ from the first vector. For example, if a first vector has a singleton-corrected capsid proteins, subsequently administered vectors may have capsid<br>
proteins selected from among the other AAV, optionally, from another serotype or from another clade.<br>
Optionally, multiple rAAV vectors can be used to deliver large transgenes or multiple transgenes by co-administration of rAAV vectors concatamerize in vivo to form a single vector genome. In such an embodiment, a first AAV may carry an expression cassette which expresses a single transgene (or a subunit thereof) and a second AAV may carry an expression cassette which expresses a second transgene (or a different subunit) for co-expression in the host cell. A first AAV may carry an expression cassette which is a first piece of a polycistronic construct (e.g., a promoter and transgene, or subunit) and a second AAV may carry an expression cassette which is a second piece of a polycistronic construct (e.g., transgene or subunit and a poly A sequence). These two pieces of a polycistronic construct concatamerize in vivo to form a single vector genome that co-expresses the transgenes delivered by the first and second AAV. In such embodiments, the rAAV vector carrying the first expression cassette and the rAAV vector carrying the second expression cassette can be delivered in a single pharmaceutical composition. In other embodiments, the two or more rAAV vectors are delivered as separate pharmaceutical compositions which can be administered substantially simultaneously, or shortly before or after one another.<br>
The above-described recombinant vectors may be delivered to host cells according to published methods. The rAAV, preferably suspended in a physiologically compatible carrier, may be administered to a human or non-human mammalian patient. Suitable carriers may be readily selected by one of skill in the art in view of the indication for which the transfer virus is directed. For example, one suitable carrier includes saline, which may be formulated with a variety of buffering solutions (e.g., phosphate buffered saline). Other exemplary carriers include sterile saline, lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, gelatin, dextran, agar, pectin, peanut oil, sesame oil, and water. The selection of the carrier is not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
Optionally, the compositions of the invention may contain, in addition to the rAAV and carrier(s), other conventional pharmaceutical ingredients, such as preservatives, or chemical stabilizers. Suitable exemplary preservatives include chlorobutanol, potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, propyl gallate, the parabens,<br>
ethyl vanillin, glycerin, phenol, and parachlorophenol. Suitable chemical stabilizers include gelatin and albumin.<br>
The vectors are administered in sufficient amounts to transfect the cells and to provide sufficient levels of gene transfer and expression to provide a therapeutic benefit without undue adverse effects, or with medically acceptable physiological effects, which can be determined by those skilled in the medical arts. Conventional and pharmaceutically acceptable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, direct delivery to a desired organ (e.g., the liver (optionally via the hepatic artery) or lung), oral, inhalation, intranasal, intratracheal, intraartenal, intraocular, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, and other parental routes of administration. Routes of administration may be combined, if desired.<br>
Dosages of the viral vector will depend primarily on factors such as the condition being treated, the age, weight and health of the patient, and may thus vary among patients. For example, a therapeutically effective human dosage of the viral vector is generally in the range of from about 0.1 mL to about 100 mL of solution containing concentrations of from about 1 x 109 to 1 x 1016 genomes virus vector. A preferred human dosage for delivery to large organs (e.g., liver, muscle, heart and lung) may be about 5 x 1010  to 5 x 1013 AAV genomes per 1 kg, at a volume of about 1 to 100 mL. A preferred dosage for delivery to eye is about 5 x 109 to 5 x 1012 genome copies, at a volume of about 0.1 mL to 1 mL. The dosage will be adjusted to balance the therapeutic benefit against any side effects and such dosages may vary depending upon the therapeutic application for which the recombinant vector is employed. The levels of expression of the transgene can be monitored to determine the frequency of dosage resulting in viral vectors, preferably AAV vectors containing the minigene. Optionally, dosage regimens similar to those described for therapeutic purposes may be utilized for immunization using the compositions of the invention.<br>
Examples of therapeutic products and immunogenic products for delivery by the AAV-contaming vectors of the invention are provided below. These vectors may be used for a variety of therapeutic or vaccinal regimens, as described herein. Additionally, these vectors may be delivered in combination with one or more other vectors or active ingredients in a desired therapeutic and/or vaccinal regimen.<br>

Gene products produced by the immune system are also useful in the invention. These include, without limitations, immunoglobulins IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, chimeric immunoglobulins, humanized antibodies, single chain antibodies, T cell receptors, chimeric T cell receptors, single chain T cell receptors, class I and class IIMHC molecules, as well as engineered immunoglobulins and MHC molecules. Useful gene products also include complement regulatory proteins such as complement regulatory proteins, membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor (DAF), CR1, CF2 and CD59.<br><br>
Still other useful gene products include any one of the receptors for the hormones, growth factors, cytokines, lymphokmes, regulatory proteins and immune system proteins. The invention encompasses receptors for cholesterol regulation and/or lipid modulation, including the low density lipoprotem (LDL) receptor, high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, and scavenger receptors. The invention also encompasses gene products such as members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily including glucocorticold receptors and estrogen receptors, Vitamin D receptors and other nuclear receptors. In addition, useful gene products include transcription factors such asjun,fos, max, mad, serum response factor (SRF), AP-1, AP2, myb, MyoD and myogenin, ETS-box containing proteins, TFE3, E2F, ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, ATF4, ZF5, NFAT, CREB, HNF-4, C/EBP, SP1, CCAAT-box binding proteins, interferon regulation factor (IRF-1), Wilms tumor protein, ETS-binding protein, STAT, GATA-box binding proteins, e.g., GATA-3, and the forkhead family of winged helix proteins.<br>

For example, enzymes that contain mannose-6-phosphate may be utilized in therapies for lysosomal storage diseases (e.g., a suitable gene includes that encoding (3-glucuromdase (GUSB)).<br>
Still other useful gene products include those used for treatment of hemophilia, including hemophilia B (including Factor IX) and hemophilia A (including Factor VIII and its variants, such as the light chain and heavy chain of the heterodimer and the B-deleted domain, US Patent No. 6,200,560 and US Patent No. 6,221,349). The<br>
Factor VIII gene codes for 2351 amino acids and the protein has six domains, designated from the amino to the terminal carboxy terminus as A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 [Wood et al, Nature, 312:330 (1984); Vehar et al, Nature 312:337 (1984); and Toole et al, Nature, 342:337 (1984)]. Human Factor VIE is processed within the cell to yield a heterodimer primarily comprising a heavy chain containing the Al, A2 and B domains and a light chain containing the A3, Cl and C2 domains. Both the single chain polypeptide and the heterodimer circulate in the plasma as inactive precursors, until activated by thrombin cleavage between the A2 and B domains, which releases the B domain and results in a heavy chain consisting of the Al and A2 domains. The B domain is deleted in the activated procoagulant form of the protein. Additionally, in the native protein, two polypeptide chains ("a" and "b"), flanking the B domain, are bound to a divalent calcium cation.<br>
In some embodiments, the minigene comprises first 57 base pairs of the Factor VIII heavy chain which encodes the 10 amino acid signal sequence, as well as the human growth hormone (hGH) polyadenylation sequence. In alternative embodiments, the minigene further comprises the Al and A2 domains, as well as 5 amino acids from the N-terminus of the B domain, and/or 85 amino acids of the C-terminus of the B domain, as well as the A3, Cl and C2 domains. In yet other embodiments, the nucleic acids encoding Factor VIII heavy chain and light chain are provided in a single minigene separated by 42 nucleic acids coding for 14 ammo acids of the B domain [US Patent No. 6,200,560].<br>
As used herein, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of AAV vector that produces sufficient amounts of Factor VIII to decrease the time it takes for a subject's blood to clot. Generally, severe hemophiliacs having less than 1% of normal levels of Factor VIII have a whole blood clotting time of greater than 60 minutes as compared to approximately 10 minutes for non-hemophiliacs.<br>
The present invention is not limited to any specific Factor VIII sequence. Many natural and recombinant forms of Factor VIII have been isolated and generated. Examples of naturally occurring and recombinant forms of Factor VII can be found in the patent and scientific literature including, US Patent Nos. 5,563,045; 5,451,521, 5,422,260; 5,004,803; 4,757,006; 5,661,008; 5,789,203; 5,681,746; 5,595,886; 5,045,455; 5,668,108; 5,633,150; 5,693,499; 5,587,310; 5,171,844; 5,149,637; 5,112,950;<br>
4,886,876; International Patent Publication Nos. WO 94/11503, WO 87/07144, WO 92/16557, WO 91/09122, WO 97/03195, WO 96/21035, and WO 91/07490; European Patent Application Nos. EP 0 672 138, EP 0 270 618, EP 0 182 448, EP 0 162 067, EP 0 786 474, EP 0 533 862, EP 0 506 757, EP 0 874 057JEP 0 795 021, EP 0 670 332, EP 0 500 734, EP 0 232 112, and EP 0 160 457; Sanberg et al, XXth Int. Congress of the World Fed. Of Hemophilia (1992), and Lmd et al, Eur. J. Biochem., 232:19 (1995).<br>
Nucleic acids sequences coding for the above-described Factor VIII can be obtained using recombinant methods or by deriving the sequence from a vector known to include the same. Furthermore, the desired sequence can be isolated directly from cells and tissues containing the same, using standard techniques, such as phenol extraction and PCR of cDNA or genomic DNA [See, e.g., Sambrook et al]. Nucleotide sequences can also be produced synthetically, rather than cloned. The complete sequence can be assembled from overlapping oligonucleotides prepared by standard methods and assembled into a complete coding sequence [See, e.g., Edge, Nature 292:757 (1981); Nambari et al, Science, 223:1299 (1984); and Jay et al, J. Biol. Chem. 259:6311 (1984).<br>
Furthermore, the invention is not limited to human Factor VIII. Indeed, it is intended that the present invention encompass Factor VIII from animals other than humans, including but not limited to companion animals (e.g., canine, felines, and equines), livestock (e.g., bovines, caprines and ovines), laboratory animals, marine mammals, large cats, etc.<br>
The AAV vectors may contain a nucleic acid coding for fragments of Factor VIII which is itself not biologically active, yet when administered into the subject improves or restores the blood clotting time. For example, as discussed above, the Factor VIE protein comprises two polypeptide chains: a heavy chain and a light chain separated by a B-domain which is cleaved during processing. As demonstrated by the present invention, co-tranducing recipient cells with the Factor VIII heavy and light chains leads to the expression of biologically active Factor VIII. Because most hemophiliacs contain a mutation or deletion in only one of the chains (e.g., heavy or light chain), it may be possible to administer only the chain defective in the patient to supply the other chain.<br>
Other useful gene products include non-naturally occurring polypeptides, such as chimeric or hybrid polypeptides having a non-naturally occurring amino acid sequence containing insertions, deletions or ammo acid substitutions. For example,<br>
single-chain engineered immunoglobulins could be useful in certain immunocompromised patients. Other types of non-naturally occurring gene sequences include antisense molecules and catalytic nucleic acids, such as ribozymes, which could be used to reduce overexpression of a target.<br>
Reduction and/or modulation of expression of a gene is particularly desirable for treatment of hyperproliferative conditions characterized by hyperproliferating cells, as are cancers and psoriasis. Target polypeptides include those polypeptides which are produced exclusively or at higher levels in hyperproliferative cells as compared to normal cells. Target antigens include polypeptides encoded by oncogenes such as myb, myc, fyn, and the translocation gene bcr/abl, ras, src, P53, neu, trk and EGRF. In addition to oncogene products as target antigens, target polypeptides for anti-cancer treatments and protective regimens include variable regions of antibodies made by B cell lymphomas and variable regions of T cell receptors of T cell lymphomas which, in some embodiments, are also used as target antigens for autoimmune disease. Other tumor-associated polypeptides can be used as target polypeptides such as polypeptides which are found at higher levels in tumor cells including the polypeptide recognized by monoclonal antibody 17-1A and folate binding polypeptides.<br>
Other suitable therapeutic polypeptides and proteins include those which may be useful for treating individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases and disorders by conferring a broad based protective immune response against targets that are associated with autoimmunity including cell receptors and cells which produce "self-directed antibodies. T cell mediated autoimmune diseases include Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), Sjbgren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), autoimmune thyroiditis, reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, psoriasis, vasculitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Each of these diseases is characterized by T cell receptors (TCRs) that bind to endogenous antigens and initiate the inflammatory cascade associated with autoimmune diseases.<br>
C.       Immunogenic Transgenes<br>
Suitably, the AAV vectors of the invention avoid the generation of immune responses to the AAV sequences contained within the vector. However, these vectors may nonetheless be formulated in a manner that permits the expression of a transgene carried by the vectors to induce an immune response to a selected antigen. For example, in order to promote an immune response, the transgene may be expressed from a constitutive promoter, the vector can be adjuvanted as described herein, and/or the vector can be put into degenerating tissue.<br>
Examples of suitable immunogenic transgenes include those selected from a variety of viral families. Examples of desirable viral families against which an immune response would be desirable include, the picornavirus family, which includes the genera rhinoviruses, which are responsible for about 50% of cases of the common cold; the genera enteroviruses, which include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and human enteroviruses such as hepatitis A virus; and the genera apthoviruses, which are responsible for foot and mouth diseases, primarily in non-human animals. Within the picornavirus family of viruses, target antigens include the VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, and VPG.   Other viral families include the astroviruses and the calcivirus family. The calcivirus family encompasses the Norwalk group of viruses, which are an important causative agent of epidemic gastroenteritis. Still another viral family desirable for use in targeting antigens for inducing immune responses in humans and non-human animals is the togavirus family, which includes the genera alphavirus, which include Sindbis viruses, RossRiver virus, and Venezuelan, Eastern &amp; Western Equine encephalitis, and rubivirus, including Rubella virus.   The flaviviridae family includes dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis and tick borne encephalitis viruses. Other target antigens may be generated from the Hepatitis C or the coronavirus family, which includes a number of non-human viruses such as infectious bronchitis virus (poultry), porcine transmissible gastroenteric virus (pig), porcine hemagglutinatin encephalomyelitis virus (pig), feline infectious peritonitis virus (cat), feline enteric coronavirus (cat), canine coronavirus (dog), and human respiratory coronaviruses, which may cause the common cold and/or non-A, B or C hepatitis, and which include the putative cause of sudden acute respiratory syndrome (S ARS). Within the coronavirus family, target antigens include the El (also called M or matrix protein), E2 (also called S or Spike protein), E3 (also called<br>
HE or hemagglutin-elterose) glycoprotein (not present in all coronaviruses), or N (nucleocapsid). Still other antigens may be targeted against the arterivirus family and the rhabdovirus family. The rhabdovirus family includes the genera vesiculovirus (e.g., Vesicular Stomatitis Virus), and the general lyssavirus (e.g., rabies). Within the rhabdovirus family, suitable antigens may be derived from the G protein or the N protein. The family filoviridae, which includes hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Marburg and Ebola virus may be a suitable source of antigens. The paramyxovirus family includes parainfluenza Virus Type 1, parainfluenza Virus Type 3, bovine parainfluenza Virus Type 3, rubulavirus (mumps virus, parainfluenza Virus Type 2, parainfluenza virus Type 4, Newcastle disease virus (chickens), rinderpest, morbillivirus, which includes measles and canine distemper, and pneumovirus, which includes respiratory syncytial virus. The influenza virus is classified within the family orthomyxovirus and is a suitable source of antigen (e.g., the HA protein, the Nl protein). The bunyavirus family includes the genera bunyavirus (California encephalitis, La Crosse), phlebovirus (Rift Valley Fever), hantavirus (puremala is a hemahagin fever virus), nairovirus (Nairobi sheep disease) and various unassigned bungaviruses. The arenavirus family provides a source of antigens against LCM and Lassa fever virus. Another source of antigens is the bornavirus family. The reovirus family includes the genera reovirus, rotavirus (which causes acute gastroenteritis in children), orbiviruses, and cultivirus (Colorado Tick fever, Lebombo (humans), equine encephalosis, blue tongue). The retrovirus family includes the sub-family oncorivirinal which encompasses such human and veterinary diseases as feline leukemia virus, HTLVI and HTLVII, lentivirinal (which includes HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, equine infectious anemia virus, and spumavirinal).<br>
With respect to HTV and SPV, many suitable antigens have been described and can readily be selected. Examples of suitable HIV and SIV antigens include, without limitation the gag, pol, Vif, Vpx, VPR, Env, Tat and Rev proteins, as well as various fragments thereof. For example, suitable fragments of the envelope (env) protein include, e.g., gp41, gp!40, and gp!20. In addition, a variety of modifications to these and other HTV and SIV antigens have been described. Suitable antigens for this purpose are known to those of skill in the art. For example, one may select a sequence encoding the gag, pol, Vif, and Vpr, Env, Tat and Rev, amongst other proteins. See, e.g., the modified gag<br>
protein which is described in US Patent 5,972,596. See, also, the HTV and SIV proteins described in D.H. Barouch et al, J. Virol., 75(5):2462-2467 (March'2001), and R.R. Amara, et al, Science, 292:69-74 (6 April 2001). These proteins or subunits thereof may be delivered alone, or in combination via separate vectors or from a single vector.<br>
The papovavirus family includes the sub-family polyomaviruses (BKU and JCU viruses) and the sub-family papillomavirus (associated with cancers or malignant progression of papilloma).

Administration of the vectors of the invention to deliver immunogens against the variable region of the T cells elicit an immune response including CTLs to eliminate those T cells. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), several specific variable regions of TCRs which are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include V-3, V-14, V-17 and V-17. Thus, delivery of a nucleic acid sequence that encodes at least one of these polypeptides will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in RA. In multiple sclerosis (MS), several specific variable regions of TCRs which are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include V-7 and V-10. Thus, delivery of a nucleic acid sequence that encodes at least one of these polypeptides will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in MS.   In scleroderma, several specific variable regions of TCRs which are involved in the disease have been characterized. These TCRs include V-6, V-8, V-14 and V-16, V-3C, V-7, V-14, V-15, V-16, V-28 and V-12. Thus, delivery of a nucleic acid molecule that encodes at least one of these polypeptides will elicit an immune response that will target T cells involved in scleroderma.<br>
Thus, a rAAV-derived recombinant viral vector of the invention provides an efficient gene transfer vehicle which can deliver a selected transgene to a selected host cell in vivo or ex vivo even where the organism has neutralizing antibodies to one or more<br>
AAV sources. In one embodiment, the rAAV and the cells are mixed ex vivo; the infected cells are cultured using conventional methodologies; and the transduced cells are re-infused into the patient.<br>
These compositions are particularly well suited to gene delivery for therapeutic purposes and for immunization, including inducing protective immunity. AAV of the invention and compositions containing same can also be used in immunization regimens such as those described in co-owned US Patent Application No. 60/565,936, filed April 28, 2004 for "Sequential Adenovirus and AAV-Mediated Delivery of Immunogenic Molecules".<br>
Further, the compositions of the invention may also be used for<br>
production of a desired gene product in vitro. For in vitro production, a desired product (e.g., a protein) may be obtained from a desired culture following transfection of host cells with a rAAV containing the molecule encoding the desired product and culturing the cell culture under conditions which permit expression. The expressed product may then be purified and isolated, as desired. Suitable techniques for transfection, cell culturing, purification, and isolation are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The following examples illustrate several aspects and embodiments of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
According to the method of the invention, AAV sequences have been identified as having singletons, when placed in an alignment with a library of sequences containing representatives of each of clades A, B, C, D, E, and F (represented by AAV9). The following table illustrates the capsid sequences and the singleton to be altered to a conserved sequence. For certain mutations, the singleton is followed by an * and then the amino acid reside which replaces it. For other mutations, the singleton is followed by its amino acid position and the residue which replaced it.<br>
The amino acid numbering is based upon the published sequences for each of these AAV capsids. See, e.g., G. Gao, et al, J. Virol., 78(12):6381-6388 (June 2004) and International Patent Publication No. WO 2004/042397 [all sequences therein deposited<br>
with GenBank], and International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/033321, filed September 30, 2004, which are incorporated by reference.<br>
For example, with reference to the following table, the nomenclature should be read as follow. Cy5Rl refers to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 24, which has been modified to contain an aspartic acid (D) in amino acid residue position 13; cy5 has a glycine in its native amino acid sequence at residue number 13. Cy5R2 refers to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:24, which has been modified to contain an aspartic acid in ammo acid position 13 (glycine in the native sequence) and an asparagine in amino acid residue position 403 (aspartic acid in the native sequence).    Cy5R3 has the ammo acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:24, which has been modified to have the same modifications as the Cy5R2 and, additionally, a lysine at position 158 (natively an asparagine) and a glutamme at position 161 (natively a proline). Given this information, one of skill in the art should be readily able to determine the other singleton modifications recited in the following table.    <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In a preliminary study, five clones were selected to test the singleton method of the invention. The table below provides the phenotype description of the 5 clones. The number of predicted singletons is given with the clade and serotype classification.<br>
Packaging phenotype is considered insufficient when their titer is lower than lxl0HGC, low when lower than lx!012GC, good when lower Ixl013, excellent when higher.<br>
Gene transfer phenotypes were established by CB. Al AT gene expression and indicated as follows; "+++" better than lead candidate for target tissue, "++", "+" and "-" respectively better than 50%, between 10-50% or lower than 10% of A1AT serum levels of lead candidates (muscle: AAV1, Liver: AAV8, Lung:AAV9). "n/a" indicated that vector could not be produced at sufficient levels for in vivo gene transfer studies.<br>
Cloning of the singleton corrections went as follows. From the original packaging plasmid, site directed mutagenesis was performed. Subsequent to that, vector backbone integrity was assayed by a PstI digest and correction of the singleton was confirmed by sequencing. EGFP-expressmg vector was then produced in triplicates on 12-well format side by side with the parental singleton-containing vector, AAV2 and AAV2/8 positive control and a production without presence of packaging plasmid as a negative control. Equal volume of harvested lysate after a 3x freeze was incubated on 293 cells. eGFP expressing was monitored by flow cytometry 72h post transduction.<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis of the singleton residues in clones rh.37, rh.2, ch.5, rh. 13, and rh.8 was performed. These particular sequences were selected to represent a variety of phenotypes that were previously documented.    <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
An increase in vector expression was noticed for 4 out of 5 clones. The increase was most dramatic for rh.37 and rh.2, vectors that were previously shown to have a low packaging yield. For these vectors productive particles were produced at levels sufficient for detection. Vectors rh.8 and rh.13 showed an increase in transduction.<br>
In order to distinguish the effects of the singleton mutation on transduction versus packaging and assembly, small-scale vector preparations were made and titered for Dnase resistant particles by quantitative PCR. For rh.37, a two-log increase in vector production was observed, rh.8 showed a moderate 5 fold increase in titer whereas rh.13 performed<br>
equally. All titers of singleton corrected clones were within acceptable range in comparison to AAV2 and AAV2/8 production and when extrapolated to large-scale preparations, rh.2 was not assayed for titration.<br>
Subsequently the effect of the singleton change was monitored in vitro in a transduction setting with equal particle number per cell. A titration on 293 cells was performed for rh. 8 and rh. 13.   Moderate increases in transduction efficiency were described at all MOIs.<br>
From this initial subset of 5 clones, 3 productively transduced cells. Two clones were unable to yield any eGFP expression in this setting. This is most likely due to a defect in packaging of the vector that could not be predicted by the singleton approach.<br>
The method of the invention was utilized to correct four predicted singleton locations in AAV clone hu. 46, P156S R362C S393F A676. However, these modifications did not result in an AAV which could be rescued, indicating another type of fatal error in the hu. 46 sequence.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - In Vitro Analysis of Viral Vectors with Altered Capsids<br>
Using the methods of the invention, the capsid proteins of rh.64 and hu.29 were altered and then used to construct viral vectors with the altered capsids using pseudotyping as described in Example 2 and in G. Gao etal., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 11854-9 (Sep 3, 2002).<br>
Briefly, vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were used to examine in vitro transduction efficiency of the vectors in human endothelial kidney cells (293 cells). These 293 cells were incubated in the presence of 104 GC/cell pseudoryped AAVCMVeGFP particles after a short pre-incubation with wtAd5. The number of eGFP positive cells per 10,000 total cells was measured by FACS analysis with a limit of detection of 5 cells/l0K.<br>
Modification of the Rh.64 capsid according to the invention afforded modified rh.64 particles which were over a 100-fold more efficient after a R697W change. A subsequent V686E mutation yielded a 2-fold increase in packaging capability.<br>
Modification of the Hu.29 capsid according to the invention afforded modified rh.64 virions that were rescued from a deficient packaging capability by changing G396E. A greater than 1000-fold increase in production was observed.<br>
Many of the over 20 modified AAV virions showed improvement in expression include, AAV6.1, hu.48Rl, hu.48R2, hu.44R2, hu.44R3, rh.48.2, rh.48.2, rh.48.2.1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 - Singleton effect in in vivo gene transfer applications.<br>
The effects of the singleton mutants were studied in an in vivo setting. Gene transfers studies on C57B/6 mice have been initiated on a number of vectors modified according to the method of the invention. Muscle directed and liver directed studies were initiated and benchmarked versus the current lead candidates for the particular application.<br>
Human a-antitrypsin (Al AT) was selected as a sensitive and quantitative reporter gene in the vectors and expressed under the control of CMV-enhanced chicken p-actin promoter. Employment of the CB promoter enables high levels of tissue non-specific and constitutive Al AT gene transfer to be achieved and also permits use of the same vector preparation for gene transfer studies in any tissue of interest.<br>
Muscle was chosen as a first target tissue. 40 different novel vectors (based on 24 different clones each with their respective singleton mutant(s)) were injected intramuscularly in a hind limb of C57B/6 mice. All experiments were performed with 1 x 10uGC/animal with a CB.A1 AT transgene cassette. Vectors were each time aliquoted at equal volume (50µl) per mouse and group per Clade. Every individual study comprised one or two clades with control groups including the representative serotype, AAV2/8 and AAV2/1 that served as benchmarks for muscle targeted gene transfer. Transgene expression is detected at day 7, 14, 28 and 63 post injection and evaluated by a specific hAlAT ELISA.<br>
For several isolates and singleton corrected versions, data on their performance after intraportal liver-directed infusion was generated. Preliminary results show that the majority of the corrected clones perform equal or better than the<br>
original isolated.<br>
For one particular clone namely cy.5, the singleton correction seem to beneficial effect on muscle transduction. The clone cy.5R4 carrying 4 singleton corrections improved gene transfer efficiency on an already decent muscle tropism exhibited by the original isolate. The performance of cy.5R4 is equal or slightly better than the benchmark controls AAV2/1 and AAV2/7.<br>
An isolate that was previously yielded too low titers for further evaluation, rh.64, performed exceptionally well in muscle after correction of one singleton. Rh.64Rl performed better than rh.64.2 and gave hAl AT levels higher than those achieved by its closest relative serotype AAV2/8 but also than AAV2/7.<br>
In other studies, mice were injected with vector in groups based on the clades. 1 x 10uGC/mouse was dosed with vector expressing CB.hAl AT. Serum levels of hAl AT were measured by specific hAlAT ELISA.<br>
The effects of singleton on in vivo gene transfer seem to be dependent on isolate and target tissue. Several interesting observations were made.<br>
For certain singleton clones, the effects are qualitatively similar in muscle and liver (e.g. rh.2, rh.13 or cy.5). Isolates hu.48 and rh.48 show an increased expression in muscle with increased number of singletons reverted.<br>
Other clones like rh.64 and AAV6 show a particular expression profile. Isolate hu.48R2 for example packages about lOfold less efficient when compared to hu.48R3 but the latter transduces muscle about 5-fold less efficient. AAV6 contains two singletons. Both have moderate effects on packaging and combined they bring AAV6 packaging up to benchmark level. In vitro, little difference is noticeable between the parental clone and the different clones. In vivo, in muscle, AAV6.1 and AAV6.1.2 show decreased gene transfer whereas AAV6.2 show a moderate increase.<br>
Example 5 - Evaluation of Singleton-Corrected AAV in Lung and Liver<br>
AAV vectors optimized for packaging and gene transfer efficiency by the reversion of singleton residues were further evaluated in lung and liver. The data is presented for both vectors that were identified as non-singleton containing or for those for which the singleton residue was converted to the conserved amino-acid.<br>
A.        Evaluation of CB.A IA T AA V gene transfer to lung after Intratracheal injection mediated by pi2, rh32.33, AAV2/9, AAV2/5, rh.2R, ch5R.<br>
Several AAV capsids are compared in their ability to target lung. hAlAT levels were measured in serum. The AAVs evaluated are either singleton free (pi2, rh32.33, AAV2/9, AAV2/5, rh.2R, ch5R) or contain one singleton residue (rh.2, rh.8). AAV2/5 and AAV2/9 are represented as benchmarks.<br>
The gene transfer studies were performed in C57B/6 mice (male, 5 per group) using the vectors carrying either the CB.A1 AT expression cassette (i.e., AAV2 5' ITR, chicken ß-actin promoter (CB), human αl-antitrypsin (Al AT), AAV2 3' ITR) or the CB.nLacZ expression cassette (i.e., AAV2, 5'ITR, nuclear-localized P-galactosidase (nLacZ), AAV2 3'ITR) in the capsids described above. Briefly, 50 µL of these singleton-corrected or singleton-free vectors were co-instilled (1 x 1011 genome copies (GC)) intratracheally with vectors carrying the Al AT and the vectors carrying the nLacZ (1 x 1011 GC).<br>
At days 12 and 20, 20 bleeds were taken and serum levels of Al AT were measured (ng AAT/mL serum). The data showed a dramatic increase of human al-antitrypsin expression in lung for rh.2 to rh.2R after intratracheal (IT) injection of 1 x 1011 GC. In addition a variety AAV vectors that are free of singleton residues were evaluated. All vectors showed acceptable levels of expression in lung.<br>
B.        Evaluation of AA V6 singleton vectors in comparison to the AAV2/5 and AAV2/9<br>
AAV6 singleton corrected clones were evaluated. Modified AAV6 (AAV6.2) was prepared using the singleton correction method of the invention, and the pseudotyping techniques described herein. The AAV6.2 particles carrying Al AT and LacZ expression cassettes, prepared as described in Example 5, were coinjected intranasally (1 x 1011 GC) and intratracheally. AAT expression was evaluated by ELISA in serum and in bronchial alveolar liquid (BAL). Expression levels were normalized for total protein. LacZ expression was measured by ELISA for ß-galactosidase from lung homogenate. Necropsy was performed at day 21.<br><br>
These vectors were compared to AAV2/6, a current clinical candidate for lung gene transfer, AAV 2/5 and AAV2/9 in a study involving C57 Bl/6 mice (male, n=8/ group).<br>
AAV6.2 presented statistically significant improvement over AAV6 in serum Al AT excretion. AAV6.2 also showed higher levels of A1AT levels as compared to the other vectors, including AAV2/9 and AAV2/5. Mild improvement in BAL was noted as was for LacZ expression in lung homogenate. However, due to large animal to animal variations, no conclusions could be drawn from LacZ quantitation.<br>
When evaluating the localization of AAV gene expression, superior staining for nuclear localized LacZ in the AAV2/6.2 group was observed, as compared to AAV 2/6. There was marked improvement over AAV2/6 and AAV2/5 in lung airway epithelium, the primary target for diseases like cystic fibrosis.<br>
C.	Intraportal (iv) injection of AAV.CB. A1 AT (I x 10n GC) in C57BI/6<br>
mice with clade B andclade C AAV members.<br>
All vectors used are absent of singleton residues either from isolation (AAV2/8, AAV2, hu. 13, hu.51, hu. 11, hu.53)or by mutation (hu.29R) All vectors are compared to AAV2/8 (clade E) as a benchmark.<br>
D.	Intravenous injection of AAV members of Clade E. rh. 64R1, rh. 64R2,<br>
rh.2R are singleton optimized. All other vector are singleton free.<br>
The expression from AAV Clade B and C members was found similar to equivalent for all members including hu.29R, a singleton optimized clone. This particular clone was reconstituted in packaging capability from a hu.29 and now presents similar gene transfer functionality to other members of the virus family.<br>
For Clade E vectors evaluated, all vectors that are either singleton free naturally or corrected for singleton residues perform in the similar range as the current best performer for liver directed gene transfer, AAV2/8. Particularly AAV rh64Rl and rh.64R2 are of interest, rh.64, found to be defective in packaging, now performs equally well in liver directed gene transfer after conversion of one (rh.64Rl) or two<br>
(rh.64R2) singletons. For rh.2 the singleton correction corresponds to a dramatic more than 10 fold increase in gene delivery.<br>
