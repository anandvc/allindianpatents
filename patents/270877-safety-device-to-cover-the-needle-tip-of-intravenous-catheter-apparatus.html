				<td>SAFETY DEVICE TO COVER THE NEEDLE TIP OF INTRAVENOUS CATHETER APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a safety device for needle of intravenous catheter apparatus. More particularly this invention relates to safety device fitted in intravenous catheter apparatus which covers the needle tip after use, prior to the needle being disposed off, thereby preventing accidental pricking of the used needle of intravenous catheter apparatus to medical professionals, people in-charge of disposal of hospital waste and anybody who accidentally or intentionally handles the intravenous catheter apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Intravenous Catheter Apparatus is used to inject medicines, glucose and other nourishment in liquid form, into the blood stream of patients during their treatment. Such Intravenous Catheter Apparatus are known from the prior art and permit the inlet of different media flow during the treatment of the patient. After the needle along with flexible catheter of intravenous catheter apparatus is inserted in vein of the patient and blood flashes in the catheter, the needle is withdrawn from the vein. The flexible catheter portion, continues to remain in the vein to inject medicines, glucose and other nourishment in liquid form into the blood stream. The needle after withdrawal from the vein is to be disposed off. If the used needle is not covered with some protection at it's tip, it can prick anyone who comes into it's contact, including the medical professionals and people in-charge of disposal of hospital wastes. Accidental pricking of used needle is very dangerous and at times can be<br>
fatal as the needle has before disposal come into contact with the blood of patient and therefore may be infected by disease. The above mentioned accidental pricking is of special concern as it may spread blood bome diseases like Hepatitis B, AIDS etc. In view of the foregoing a safety device is essential to completely cover the tip of the needle while disposing to prevent spread of infection.<br>
The prior art recognizes that the needle tip guard is placed upon the needle after the needle is withdrawn from the catheter. A reference may be made to U.S. Patent Nos. 5,135,504 and 6,117,108. The US Patent No. 5135504 uses a needle safety device in which a 'retaining ring' is fitted inside the intravenous catheter apparatus and the 'needle guard' slides inside the retaining ring. This device has few disadvantages: (1) retaining ring remains inside the main body during the use of apparatus which hinders flow of solutions through it, (2) there is likelihood that guard jaws which cover the needle tip during disposal may open automatically, exposing the needle tip, (3) there is chance that blood on or near the needle tip may surface out of the needle guard as the needle remain exposed from sides and the size of needle guard is small/miniature.<br>
In US. Patent No. 6117108 also, the safety device remains inside the main body of intravenous catheter apparatus and has miniature size due to which there is always strong probability of blood coming out of the safety device and infecting the persons handling the used needle.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Primary object of this invention is to propose a safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus which facilitates and ensures safe disposal of the needle after it is withdrawn from the vein of a patient.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus in which the disadvantages of prior art are overcome.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus, which locks the needle tip very securely so that the needle may not come out of safety device automatically/accidentally.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus, which is big enough to cover the needle tip from all sides thereby blood does not ooze out of the safety device.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus which may be fitted between wing body and needle hub in such a way that it does not create any impediment in the functioning and operation of the intravenous catheter apparatus.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose safety device for the needle of intravenous catheter apparatus which is externally attached to the body of catheter apparatus so that no part of it remains inside intravenous catheter apparatus, thus, it does not affect the flow of liquid through the apparatus.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus, which require slight force to detach it from the wing body, without disturbing the position of the catheter in the vein of a patient.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus which can be easily assembled and involve simple structural configuration.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus which is economical in production and use.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention consists of safety device for needle of the intravenous catheter apparatus, which is provided between wing body and needle hub of the intravenous catheter apparatus. After the needle along with flexible catheter is inserted in vein of the patient and blood flashes in the catheter, the needle is withdrawn from the vein holding the wing body. The needle hub carries the needle which moves out of the catheter and thereafter passes through wing body and reaches the safety device. As soon as the needle tip moves past the tip-blocker of safety device, the tip-blocker falls down under pressure of spring, and blocks the needle passage and comes in the way of needle tip. In consequence the tip blocker blocks the needle tip path and prevents it's inward movement. When the needle is further withdrawn, the flaring near it's tip do not allow the needle to move out of safety device. Therefore, now the needle can neither move inward nor outward and is totally locked inside the safety device. When further force is applied to pull the needle in the outward direction the safety device gets detached from the wing body of intravenous catheter apparatus and the assembly of safety device, needle and needle hub gets separated from the wing assembly. The needle can now be safely disposed as the needle tip is locked inside<br>
the safety device, in such a way that it neither protrude out nor it can be pulled out of the safety device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows Intravenous Catheter Apparatus 10 in assembled condition before use. It comprises of needle cover 12, wing housing 14, port 16 in unitary assembly and needle hub 20, luer lock 22 as attachment to wing housing 14. The needle cover 12 covers the needle 24. The needle hub 20 can be detached from the wing housing 14 such that the assembly of needle 24, needle hub 20 and luer lock 22 can be separated from the assembly of wing housing 14 and port 16. A safety device 34 is placed between wing housing 14 and needle hub 20.<br>
Figure 2 is cross section of the Intravenous Catheter Apparatus 10 which depicts a needle 24 extending from needle hub 20 through needle passage way 38 inside the wing housing 14 and ending at the needle tip 26 under the needle cover 12.<br>
The needle 24 is hollow and the needle tip 26 is cut diagonally. There is needle flaring 28 which increases the diameter of the needle 24 near the needle tip 26. Surrounding the needle 24 is a catheter 30 which is attached to the wing housing 14 at catheter base 32. The catheter 30 is a flexible tube which is placed in the vein of a patient to provide fluids, nourishment and medicines. Wing housing 14 has a port 16 covered by port cap 18 through which the fluid, nourishment or medicines are injected which travel through wing housing 14 and catheter 30 to reach the veins of the patient. The safety device 34 is located between wing housing 14 and needle hub 20 and is aligned in the vertical plane along the same plane as the port 16 and needle hub 20. Two lugs 36 hold the safety device 34 to the wing housing 14 under normal condition.<br>
Figure 3 is the enlarged cross section view of the safety device 34 of Figure-2. The needle 24 passes through the needle passageway 38 and<br>
bush 40 inside the safety device 34. The safety device 34 has tip blocker 42 which is used to block the needle tip 26. A spring 44 is arranged in compressed state inside the groove 46 of tip blocker 42 and is held in position by a disc 48.<br>
To use the intravenous catheter apparatus 10 the needle cover 12 is removed and the needle 24 along with catheter 30 is taken out. The needle 24 with catheter 30 is inserted into the vein of patient. Since there is pressure of blood in the vein, as soon as needle tip 26 punctures the skin and enters the vein, the blood gushes up into the hollow needle 24 and through the wing housing 14 reaches the flash back chamber 50. The needle 24 is than withdrawn from the vein and catheter 30, by holding at the needle hub 20. The needle 24 in course of withdrawal passes through catheter base 32 and silicon tube 52. Figure 4 shows top view of IV Catheter Apparatus 10 when the needle 24 is partially withdrawn from the wing housing 14. The cross-section Figure 4A show clearly that the needle 24 has been withdrawn from catheter 30, catheter base 32 and silicon tube 52 and the needle tip 26 has reached the brink of safety device 34.<br>
Figure 5, is the enlarged cross-section view of the safety device 34 of Figure 4. Figure 5 depicts the tip blocker 42 touching the surface of needle 24, the needle 24 passing through the bush 40. Now needle flaring 28 nears the tip blocker 42. The spring 44 is arranged in compressed condition which exerts pressure on the tip blocker 42. Figure 5A gives three dimensional view of constituent parts namely, needle tip 26, needle flaring 28, tip blocker 42 and bush 40.<br>
Figure 6 shows top view of intravenous catheter apparatus 10 when the needle tip 26 lies inside the safety device 34. By pulling the needle hub<br>
20 the needle 24 is withdrawn further out of the safety device 34. As the needle tip 26 moves past the tip blocker 42, the tip blocker 42 falls down under the pressure of compressed spring 44 and enters the needle passageway 38. This blocks the needle passageway 38. The Figure 6A shows the needle tip 26 being blocked by the tip blocker 42.<br>
Figure 7 in enlarged view show the spring 44 has rarefied and tip blocker 42 is in the needle passageway 38 blocking the needle tip 26. Now the needle 24 cannot move inside the wing housing 14. The location of needle flaring 28 and position of bush 40 is so adjusted that when the tip blocker 42 falls in needle passageway 38, the needle flaring 28 lies inside the safety device 34 infront of the bush 40. Figure 7A gives three dimensional view of constituent parts namely, tip-blocker 42 blocking needle tip 26, flaring 28 and the bush 40 of Figure 7.<br>
After the needle tip 26 is blocked by the tip blocker 42 as described above, on further withdrawal of the needle 24, the needle flaring 28 comes in contact with the bush 40. Since the diameter of needle 24 is increased at the needle flaring 28, the bush 40 do not allow needle flaring 28 to pass through it. Thus the needle 24 cannot be pulled out of the bush 40. If any further force is applied to pull the needle 24 out, it loosen the lugs 36 attached to the wing housing 14, which detaches the safety device 34 from the wing housing 14.<br>
Figure 8 shows top view of safety device 34, needle 24 and needle hub 20 in unitary assembly detached and separated from the wing housing 14 after the needle tip 26 is blocked by tip-blocker 42.<br>
Figure 8A shows the safety device 34 covering the needle tip 26 separated from the wing housing 14.<br><br>
Figure 9 shows the flaring 28 of the needle 24 in contact with the bush 40 on one side and tip blocker 42 blocking the needle tip 26 on the other side. Thus needle tip 26 cannot move out of the safety device 34. Thus the needle tip 26 is locked in the safety device 34. Figure 9A gives three-dimensional view of constituent parts namely, tip blocker 42, needle tip 26, flaring 28, and bush 40 with needle tip 26 locked inside safety device 34..<br>
The needle 24 with needle hub 20 on one end and safety device 34 on the other covering the needle tip 26 as seen in Figure 8 can be disposed very safely. Since the safety device 34 is made sufficiently large, it covers the needle tip 26 from all sides so that the infected needle tip 26 is not exposed from any side.<br>
The bush 40 and tip-blocker 42 arrangement locks the needle tip 26 very securely so that the needle tip 26 does not slip out of the safety device 34 accidentally.<br>
The safety device 34 in the present invention is provided as an external attachment to the intravenous catheter apparatus 10 and it detaches completely from the wing housing 14 after use, thus it does not affect the flow of fluids in the wing housing 14 and catheter 30 in the course of treatment of patient.<br>
The present invention has been shown and described above and it is understood that many modifications, substitutions and additions may be made which are within the intended spirit and scope of the invention. It can be seen that the present invention effectively covers all of its stated objectives.<br><br><br>
