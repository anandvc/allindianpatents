				<td>Method and system for forming a branch in a polymeric pipe, using heated<br>
liquid in order to plasticize a pipe wall section which is to be displaced<br>
outwardly to form said branch.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for forming a branch in a pipe of polymeric ma-<br>
terial. Formation of a branch in pipe causes several known problems, for instance<br>
weakness at the joint. Lack of strength may arise among other reasons due to lack<br>
of an adequate surface for providing a connection between the pipes to be joined. In<br>
order to provide an adequate joint between a branch pipe of a smaller diameter ex-<br>
tending perpendicularly to a straight section of a main pipe having a larger diame-<br>
ter, particular problems will arise.<br>
According to a known method a joint between a branch pipe and a main pipe hav-<br>
ing a larger diameter is formed by making a circular hole corresponding to the size<br>
of said branch pipe into the wall of the main pipe e.g. by using a hole saw or an-<br>
other suitable equipment. The pipes are then connected by welding the outer side-<br>
wall of the branch pipe to the inner sidewall of the main pipe. Another method of<br>
forming a branch in pipe is to cut out a V-shaped section from a main pipe and cut-<br>
ting one end of a branch pipe mating V-shape and sized to be received in the V-<br>
shaped opening in the main pipe. Connection of the branch pipe to the main pipe is<br>
achieved by welding the outer sidewall of the branch pipe to the sidewall of the<br>
main pipe. A sidewall weld connection is much more inferior than a joint connec-<br>
tion between adjacent coaxial pipes.<br>
It is also well known that pipes are subject to wear at locations where a pipe<br>
changes direction particularly if abrasive material is transported in the pipe. Exces-<br>
sive wear occurs generally at the joint. It is known to reinforce a joint by adding<br>
additional material to the pipe near the joint either onto the outside or onto the in-<br>
side. However when the material is added onto the inside of the pipe (e.g. by a<br>
liner) the internal cross section of the pipe is reduced causing an impediment to a<br><br>
flow through the joint. It would not be cost effective to produce pipes for special joints<br>
having increased thickness for a small quantity of fittings in discussion. Another method<br>
to reinforce onto the exterior of a pipe near a joint is to use either a thermosetting polymer<br>
or additional polymer of same type as that in the pipe, which method will need an<br>
additional mould process.<br>
US patent No. 5 958 172 discloses a method of forming a reinforced joint of<br>
polymeric material, comprising the steps of : forcing a first pipe section of polymeric<br>
material into a second pipe section of polymeric material to expand the second pipe<br>
section for securing the first pipe section in the second pipe section, thereby forming a<br>
first reinforced joint element ; forcing a third pipe section of polymeric material into a<br>
fourth pipe section of polymeric material to thereby securely fix the third pipe section in<br>
the fourth pipe section and form a second reinforced joint element ; cutting the first<br>
reinforced joint element transversely in a plane skewed relative to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the first reinforced joint element; and connecting the first reinforced joint element to the<br>
second reinforced joint element to form the reinforced joint which is angled.<br>
The present invention has been devised to form such a joint in a pipe to overcome<br>
the disadvantages of prior art. The distinguishing features of the present invention over<br>
prior art would be evident from the description given hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to build up a branch in pipe of any commonly<br>
available pipe size, which permits formation of a joint on the branch, which is as strong<br>
as a joint between coaxial pipes, preferably by using standard equipment. Further the<br>
object of the invention is to provide an inexpensive method employing the polymeric<br>
material of the pipe to form a branch without damaging the pipe and requiring little<br>
preparation to be carried out, which method will result in a finished branch having a<br>
prolonged life even when used under wearing conditions and causing no constriction of<br>
flow through the branch.<br><br>
This is achieved with a method comprising the steps of:<br>
-	making a circular hole in the wall of a main pipe, said hole being considerably smaller<br>
than the size of a branch to be formed ;<br>
-	applying an end of an outer cylindrical mould tightly against the outer wall of the main<br>
pipe concentrically with said circular hole ;<br>
-	introducing a forming member, having a conical nose, into the main pipe through one<br>
end ;<br>
-	fixing the forming member to an end of a puller device brought into the main pipe<br>
through said circular hole ;<br>
-	applying heat to a portion of the exterior surface of the pipe wall defined by said outer<br>
mould, using a suitable liquid heated to a temperature less than the melting temperature<br>
of the polymeric material in order to plasticize but to prevent degradation of the<br>
polymeric material in the pipe wall, which plasticized material is intended to form the<br>
branch ;<br><br>
-	pulling the forming member gradually toward the exterior of the pipe through the<br>
plasticized wall portion coaxially with the cylindrical outer mould whereby the<br>
plasticized polymeric material of the pipe wall is displaced outwardly forming said<br>
branch, generally in the shape of a pipe section extending outwardly from the main<br>
pipe wall.<br>
The liquid used for heating the polymeric material of the pipe is preferably oil, such<br>
as ethylene glycol or possibly silicone. Further features of the method according to<br>
the invention will appear from the attached dependent method claims.<br>
The invention also concerns a system for forming a branch in a pipe made of poly-<br>
meric material comprising:<br>
-	an equipment for making a circular hole in the wall of the pipe, said hole being<br>
considerably smaller than the size of a branch to be formed;<br>
-	a forming member with a conical nose to be introduced into the pipe,<br>
-	a pulling device to be connected to the conical forming member for pulling it<br>
through the hole in the pipe wall,<br>
-	a cylindrical mould having a free end toward which outer surface of said pipe is to<br>
be tightly pressed by means of the forming member connected to the pulling de-<br>
vice, to define a circular portion of the pipe wall extending concentrically around<br>
said hole,<br>
-	a heating liquid supply and a heating liquid outflow from said mould for heating<br>
said portion of the exterior surface of the pipe.<br>
The system according to the invention provides a lot of advantages, e.g. the use of a<br>
liquid medium for heating only that portion of the exterior surface of a main pipe,<br>
where a branch pipe is to be formed. Such a heating will enable fully controllable<br>
heating of the pipe material. The branch is formed when the forming member is<br>
pulled through the hole in the pipe wall. The cylindrical mould of the system forms<br>
a chamber for the heating liquid, when the pipe wall is pressed towards the lower<br>
end of said cylindrical mould by means of the forming member pulled by the pull-<br><br>
ing device of the system. Thus the main pipe will also be held in position by the<br>
cooperating mould and the forming member, so no further fixture is needed.<br>
Further features of the system according to the invention will appear from the<br>
embodiments described hereinafter.<br>
The mould of the required diameter has a liquid inlet which allows liquid to flow while<br>
the pipe is pulled by the forming member under a low pressure such that no damage to the<br>
pipe surface occurs. When the polymeric material in the heated portion of the pipe wall<br>
becomes plastic the forming member will gradually pass through the hole made in the<br>
pipe wall, said hole having a diameter considerably smaller than the inner diameter of the<br>
branch to be formed. The liquid is heated under controlled conditions in a heating device<br>
provided with suitable control means. The forming member is provided with a conical<br>
nose and sized to define an inside diameter of the branch to be formed. The nose of the<br>
forming member is connectable to a puller device outside the pipe for pulling the forming<br>
member through the hole in the pipe wall generally from the interior of the pipe to the<br>
exterior of the pipe.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERED EMBODIMENT<br>
In the drawings a system for forming a branch 11 (Fig 6) in a pipe 12 is discloseu,<br>
which pipe is made from a polymeric material of polyolefines such as HDPE.<br>
The system comprises a stationary frame 1 provided with vertical frame posts and a<br>
horizontal bar to which a mould 9 for a required pipe diameter is connectable. A<br>
pair of cylinder piston devices 3 is mounted to said frame posts and connected with<br>
their shafts 10 to a horizontal, vertically movable frame 2, positioned above the<br>
horizontal bar of the stationary frame 1.<br>
The system further includes a cylindrical forming member 6 having a conical nose.<br>
The cylindrical body of said forming member 6 is sized to form an inner diameter<br>
of a branch 11 to be formed in a pipe 12. The end of the conical nose is connectable<br>
to an end of a puller rod 5 having its opposite end connected to the vertically mov-<br>
able bar 2. The connection between the forming member 6 and the puller rod 5 can<br>
be a thread connection using a connecting sleeve 16 at one end of the puller rod 5.<br>
The mould 9 connected to the horizontal bar of the stationary frame 1 is intended to<br>
form a chamber 13 to receive a heating liquid when a mantle of a pipe 12 is pulled<br>
or pushed towards the bottom end of said mould 9. The heating liquid is preferably<br><br>
an oil such as ethylene glycol or silicone, which is pumped into the chamber 13<br>
through a tube 7 capable of withstanding 150°C. The mould 9 is also provided with<br>
an outlet tube 8, through which the oil will flow back to an oil tank 4. The oil is<br>
preferably heated in said tank 4 by a heat exchanger.<br>
In a preferred embodiment an oil-heating system manufactured by Tool Temp AG<br>
of Switzerland is used. The system, which is connected to an electric source, is con-<br>
trolled by means of a PID temperature controller. The tubes 7 and 8 and the mould<br>
are preferably heat insulated, in order to prevent loss of heat.<br>
As shown in fig 3, the mould 9 is mounted on the frame 1 by means of bolts 18.<br>
"When a branch 11 is to be formed in a pipe 12, a small hole 14 (Tig. 3), somewhat<br>
larger than the puller rod 5 is made in the pipe wall, at a position where the branch<br>
11 is to be formed. The forming member 6 is inserted into the pipe 12 through one<br>
end on said pipe and the end of the puller rod 5 is brought into said pipe 12 through<br>
the hole 14, whereupon the puller rod 5 is connected to the conical nose of the<br>
forming member 6. When the forming member 6 has been secured to the puller rod<br>
5 the cylinder piston devices 3 are activated to slightly push the frame 2 and thus<br>
the forming member 6 upwards pressing the outer mantle of the pipe 12 against the<br>
bottom end of the mould 9 and simultaneously closing the hole 14 in the pipe wall,<br>
resulting in a tight contact between the pipe mantle and the bottom end of the<br>
mould 9. Heating liquid, e.g. ethylene glycol having a preset temperature is fed to<br>
the chamber 13 formed by the mould and the mantle of the pipe 12, heating a por-<br>
tion of the outer surface of the pipe wall defined by the bottom end of the mould 9.<br>
As the temperature reaches a level where the polymeric material in the pipe wall<br>
just changes from a solid state to a plastic state, the forming medium 6 is pulled<br>
outwards through the hole 14 by further activating the pair of cylinder piston de-<br>
vices 3, whereby the bar 2 and thus the forming member 6 will be pulled upwards<br>
The cylinder piston devices 3 are activated to pull the forming member 6 from the<br>
interior of the pipe 12 through the pipe wall to the exterior of the pipe to form the<br><br>
branch 11 by deforming the heated portion of the pipe wall, as schematically shown<br>
in Fig. 5. The supply of heating oil to the chamber 13 is stopped, all oil is returned<br>
to the oil tank 4 through tube 8, and the plastic material in the formed branch is<br>
allowed to cool, whereupon the pipe 12 with the formed branch is removed from<br>
the mould 9.<br>
It is understood that depending on the diameter of the pipe and the size of the<br>
branch 11 to be formed, moulds 9 and forming members 6 of different sizes are to<br>
be used, because the mould is intended to define the outer diameter of the branch 11<br>
and the forming member 6 is intended to define the inner diameter of the branch<br>
11 .The bottom end of the mould 9 is concavely shaped to match with the shape of<br>
the mantle of the main pipe 12.<br>
The heating of the pipe wall is thus largely confined to the area through which die<br>
forming member 6 will be pulled. The heating by oil is carried out at an oil tem<br>
perature adjusted to a level required by the plastic material in the pipe wall. During<br>
the heating stage the heating oil is circulated through tube 7 from the oil tank 4 to<br>
the mould 9 and through tube 8 back to the oil tank. When for instance a branch<br>
having a diameter of 450 mm is to be formed in a pipe 900 SDR 17 PE 100, the<br>
forming member 6 will be pulled to deform the plastic material in the pipe wall<br>
when the temperature of the plastic material reaches 130°C by applying a pressure<br>
of 50 bar for pulling the forming member 6, whereby a branch of 450 SDR 17 is<br>
received.<br>
Due to the heating with oil the surface of the heated plastic material is prevented for<br>
being oxidized, because the surface of the pipe wall will be covered by oil, all the<br>
time the plastic material is at an elevated temperature. Consequently the surface<br>
will not be in contact with the outer air before the plastic material is cooled.<br>
Preferably the diameter of the forming member 6 is somewhat larger than the inner<br>
diameter of a branch 11 to be formed, in order to allow a slight contraction of said<br><br>
inner diameter during cooling. When the forming member 6 is removed after suffi-<br>
cient cooling of the exterior surface of the pipe 12, the branch 11 thus formed will<br>
be suitable for application.<br><br>
