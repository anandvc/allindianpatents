e)	reacting a compound of formula I in which R9 is hydrogen with an isocyanate of the formula R10NCO; or<br>
f)	transforming the cyano group in a compound of formula I in which R2 is cyano and the remaining symbols have the significance set forth above into an amidino, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl, lower-alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, hydroxymethyl, formyl or hydroxyamidino group; or<br><br>
g)      alkylating the tetrazolyl group in a compound of formula I in which R2 is tetrazolyl and R9 is aryl, lower-aralkyl or hetero-cyclyl and cleaving off a hydroxy protecting group from the reaction product;<br>
and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I obtained into a salt.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula II with a compound of the formula MO(CRaRb)nOR91 (process variant a) is conveniently carried out in a glycol corresponding to this compound as the solvent, e.g. in ethylene glycol when n = 2 and Ra and Rb are hydrogen.   The alkali metal M is preferably sodium and Hal is preferably chlorine.   The reaction is conveniently carried out while heating, e.g. to 40-100oC.   According to this process variant there are obtained compounds of formula I in which R2 signifies cyano and A and B signify CH; or R2 signifies hydrogen and one of the symbols A or B signifies N-oxide and the other signifies CH, and R9 is a residue R91 as defined above, and the remaining symbols have the given significance.<br>
In process variant b) a N-oxide of formula II is preferably reacted with trimethylsilyl cyanide and triethylamine.   The reaction is conveniently carried out in acetonitrile while heating to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.   According to this process variant there are obtained compounds of formula I in which R2 signifies cyano and one of the symbols A or B signifies nitrogen and the other signifies CH and the remaining symbols have the given significance.<br>
In the reaction according to process variant c) there can be used as the azide e.g. sodium azide, guanidinium azide or trimethylsilyl azide.   Ammonium salts, e.g. ammonium chloride, can be used as Lewis acids.   The reaction can be carried out in an aprotic, polar solvent such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, conveniently while heating, e.g. to a temperature of 60-100°C.<br><br>
The reaction of a compound of formula I in which R2 is cyano with hydrazine according to process variant d) proceeds via the iminoether, from which the amidrazone, i.e. a compound corresponding to formula I with R2 = -CH(NH)NHNH2, is obtained with excess hydrazine.   The amidrazone is converted by nitro-sation into an iminoazide which cyclizes spontaneously to the tetrazole.   According to process variants c) and d) there are obtained compounds of formula I in which R2 signifies tetrazolyl and the remaining symbols have the given significance.<br>
The reaction in accordance with process variant e) can be effected in a manner known per se for the preparation of carbamates from alcohols and isocyanates, e.g. in in a suitable anhydrous organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon such as toluene, conveniently while heating.   The isocyanate can be generated in situ, e.g. from an azide of the formula R10CON3 by thermal rearrangement.   According to this process variant there are obtained compounds of formula I in which R9 signifies a residue -C(O)NHR10 and the remaining symbols have the given significance.<br>
The transformation of a cyano group R2 in a compound of formula I into an amidino, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl, lower-alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, hydroxymethyl, formyl or hydroxy-amidino group in accordance with process variant f) can be effected in a manner known per se for such transformations.   For example, the cyano group can be converted by treatment with alkali alcoholate, e.g. with sodium methylate in methanol, into an iminoether (i.e., the group C(NH)0CH3) which can be converted in situ by treatment with hydrochloric acid into an alkyl carboxylate (e.g. the group -COOCH3), which can be saponified to the carbox-ylic acid by treatment with alcoholic alkali.   Alternatively, the iminoether, obtained in situ, can be transformed by treatment with ammonium chloride in methanol into the corresponding amidino compound (R2 = amidino) and this can be transformed by treatment with aqueous alkali and subsequent acidification into the corresponding carbamoyl compound (R2 = -C(O)NH2)).  By treatment of the iminoether, obtained in situ, with hydroxyl-<br><br>
amine and aqueous sodium acetate solution there can be obtained the corresponding hydroxyamidino compounds (R2 = -C(NH)NHOH). A carboxy group can be reduced by treatment with reducing agents such as sodium dihydro-bis-(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminate in toluene to the hydroxymethyl group and this can be oxidized to the formyl group by treatment with oxidizing agents such as manganese dioxide.   In these reaction sequences R3 should not contain a hydroxy group, i.e. R9 should not represent hydrogen, but should represent e.g. benzyl.<br>
The alkylation of a compound of formula I in accordance with process variant g) can be carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by treatment with a lower-alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as K tert.-butylate in tetrahydrofuran, whereby a thus-obtained mixture of 1- and 2-lower-alkyl-tetrazolyl compounds of formula I can be separated in a manner known per se, e.g. by chromatography.   Suitable hydroxy protecting groups are e.g. alkylsilyl protecting groups such as dimethyl-tert-butylsilyl and tetrahydropyranyl, which can be introduced and cleaved off from the reaction product in a manner known per se. According to process variant g) there are accordingly obtained compounds of formula I In which R2 represents a lower-alkyl-tetrazolyl residue and R9 represents hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of formula I which contain a carboxy or tetrazolyl group can be converted in a manner known per se into pharmaceutically usable salts, e.g. alkali salts such as Na and K salts or alkaline earth metal salts such as Ca or Mg salts or salts with amines such as monoethanolamine.<br>
The compounds which are used as starting materials, insofar as they are not known or their preparation is described hereinafter, can be prepared in analogy to known methods or to methods described below.<br>
The compounds of formula I given above are endothelin receptor inhibitors.   They can therefore be used for the treatment of disorders which are associated with endothelin activities,<br><br>
especially circulatory disorders such as hypertension, ischaemia, vasospasms and angina pectoris.<br>
The inhibitory activity of the compounds of formula I on endothelin receptors can be demonstrated using the test procedures described hereinafter:<br>
       Inhibition of endothelin binding to recombinant ETA receptors<br>
A cDNA coding for human ETA receptors of human placenta was cloned (M. Adachi, Y.-Y. Yang, Y. Furuichi and C. Miyamoto, BBRC 180, 1265-1272) and expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell system.    Baculovirus-infected insect cells from a 23 I fermenter are centrifuged off (3000 x g, 15 minutes, 4oC) 60 hours after the infection, re-suspended in Tris buffer (5 mM, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2) and again centrifuged.  After a further re-suspension and centrifugation the cells are suspended in 800 ml of the same buffer and freeze-dried at -120oC.  The cells disintegrate when the suspension in this hypotonic buffer mixture is thawed.   After a repeated freeze-drying/thawing cycle the suspension is homogenized and centrifuged (25000 x g, 15 minutes, 4oC).  After suspension in Tris buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4, 25 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose) 1 ml aliquots (protein content about 3.5 mg/ml) are stored at -85°C.<br>
For the binding assay, the freeze-dried membrane preparations are thawed and, after centrifugation at 20°C and 25000 g for 10 minutes, re-suspended in assay buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25 mM MnClz, 1   mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin).   100µl of this membrane suspension containing 70 µg of protein are incubated with 50 µl of 1251.<br>
endothelin (specific activity 2200 Ci/mMol) in assay buffer (25000 cpm, final concentration 20 pM) and 100 µl of assay<br>
buffer containing varying concentrations of test compound.   The incubation is carried out at 20°C for 2 hours or at 4oC for 24 hours.   The separation of free and membrane-bound radioligands is carried out by filtration over a glass fibre filter.   The inhibitory activity of compounds of formula I determined in this<br><br>
test procedure is given in Table 1 as the IC50, i.e. as the concentration [nM] which Is required to Inhibit 50% of the specific binding of 125|-endothelln.<br><br>
11.      Inhibition of endothelin-induced contractions in isolated rat aorta rings<br>
Rings with a length of 5 mm were cut out from the thorax aorta of adult Wistar-Kyoto rats.   The endothelium was removed by lightly rubbing the internal surface.   Each ring was immersed at 37°C in 10 ml of Krebs-Henseleit solution in an isolated bath while gassing with 95% O2 and 5% CO2.  The isometric stretching of the rings was measured.   The rings were stretched to a pretension of 3 g.   After incubation for 10 minutes with the test compound or vehicle cumulative dosages of endothelin-1 were added.  The activity of the test compound was ascertained by the observed shift to the right of the dosage-activity curve of endothelin-1 in the presence of different concentrations of antagonist.  This shift to the right (or "dose ratio", DR) corresponds to the quotient from the EC50 values of endothelin-1 in the presence and in the absence of antagonist, with the EC50 value denoting the endothelin concentration required for a half-maximum contraction.<br>
The corresponding pA2 value, which is a measure of the activity of the test compound, was calculated using a computer programme according to the following equation from the "dose ratio" DR for each individual dosage-activity curve.<br><br>
pA2 = log(DR-1)-log(antagonist-concentration)<br>
The EC50 of endothelin in the absence of test compounds is 0.3 nM.<br>
The pA2 values obtained with compounds of formula I are given in Table 2.<br><br>
On the basis of their capability of inhibiting endothelin binding, the compounds of formula I can be used as medicaments for the treatment of disorders which are associated with vasoconstriction of Increasing frequencies.   Examples of such disorders are high blood pressure, coronary disorders, cardiac insufficiency, renal and myocardial ischaemia, renal insufficiency, dialysis, cerebral ischaemia, cerebral infarct, migraine, subarachnoid haemorrhage, Raynaud syndrome and pulmonary high pressure.   They can also be used in atherosclerosis, the prevention of restenosis after balloon-induced vascular dilation, inflammations, gastric and duodenal ulcers, ulcus cruris, gram-negative sepsis, shock, glomerulonephtritis, renal colic, glaucoma, asthma, in the therapy and prophylaxis of diabetic complications and complications in the administration of cyclosporin, as well as other disorders associated with endothelin activities.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be administered orally, rectally, parentally, e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly.<br><br>
subcutaneously, intrathecally or transdermally; or sublingually or as opththalmological preparations, or as an areosol.   Capsules, tablets, suspensions or solutions for oral administration, suppositories, injection solutions, eye drops, salves or spray solutions are examples of administration forms.<br>
Intravenous, intramuscular or oral administration is a preferred form of use.  The dosages in which the compounds of formula I are administered in effective amounts depend on the nature of the specific active ingredient, the age and the requirements of the patient and the mode of administration.   In general, dosages of about 0.1-100 mg/kg body weight per day come into consideration.   The preparations containing the compounds of formula I can contain inert or also pharmacodynamically active additives.   Tablets or granulates e.g. can contain a series of binders, fillers, carriers or diluents.   Liquid preparations can be present, for example, in the form of a sterile water-miscible solution.   Capsules can contain a filler or thickener in addition to the active ingredient.    Furthermore, flavour-improving additives as well as substances usually used as preserving, stabilizing, moisture-retaining and emulsifying agents as well as salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers and other additives can also be present.<br>
The previously mentioned carrier materials and diluents can comprise organic or inorganic substances, e.g. water, gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arable, poly-alkylene glycols and the like.   It is a prerequisite that all adjuvants used in the manufacture of the preparations are nontoxic.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the Invention in more detail.   DMF denotes dimethylformamide, THF denotes tetrahydro-furan and EtOAc denotes ethyl acetate.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
a)	200 ml of dimethoxyethane and 110.9 g of 4-[4-(4-tert-<br>
butyl-phenyl-sulphonylamino)-6-chloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-<br>
pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyrldine 1-oxide are added all at once to a<br>
solution of 23.80 g of sodium in 660 ml of ethylene glycol.   The<br>
solution is heated at 90oC for 20 hours while stirring, thereafter<br>
cooled, poured into 2500 ml of H2O and thereafter treated with<br>
CH3COOH to pH 5.   The mixture is extracted three times with<br>
EtOAc, the organic phase is washed with H2O, dried with Na2SO4<br>
and evaporated under reduced pressure.   The residue is recrystall-<br>
ized from CH3CN and thereafter twice from a mixture of acetone<br>
and CH3CN.   There is thus obtained 4-[4-(4-tert-butyl-phenyl-<br>
sulphonylamino)-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-<br>
pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyridine   1 -oxide.<br>
Preparation of the starting material:<br>
b)	53.1  g of 4-cyano-pyridine (98%) are added all at once to a<br>
solution of 1.15 g of sodium in 200 ml of abs. MeOH.  After<br>
6 hours 29.5 g of NH4C! are added while stirring vigorously.   The mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.   600 ml of ether are added thereto, whereupon the precipitate is filtered off under suction and thereafter dried at 50°C under reduced pressure.   There is thus obtained 4-amidino-pyridine hydrochloride (decomposition point 245-2470C).<br>
c)	112.9 g of diethyl (2-methoxyphenoxy)malonate are added<br>
dropwise within 30 minutes to a solution of 27.60 g of sodium<br>
in 400 ml of MeOH.  Thereafter, 74.86 g of the amidine hydro<br>
chloride obtained in b) are added all at once.   The mixture is<br>
stirred at room temperature overnight and evaporated at 50°C<br>
under reduced pressure.   The residue is treated with 500 ml of<br>
ether and filtered off under suction.   The filter cake is dissolved<br>
in 1000 ml of H2O and treated little by little with 50 ml of<br>
CH3COOH.   The precipitate is filtered off under suction, washed<br>
with 400 ml of H2O and dried at 80°C under reduced pressure.<br><br>
There is thus obtained 5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidine-4,6-diol (or tautomer), melting point above 250oC.<br>
d)	A suspension of 154.6 g of 5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidine-4,6-diol (or tautonner) in 280 mi of POCI3 is heated at 120oC in an oil bath for 24 hours while stirring vigorously.   The reaction mixture changes gradually into a dark brown liquid which is evaporated under reduced pressure and thereafter taken up three times with 500 ml of toluene and evaporated.   The residue is dissolved in 1000 ml of CH2CI2, treated with ice and H2O and thereafter adjusted with 3N NaOH until the aqueous phase has pH 8.  The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with CH2CI2. The combined CH2CI2 extracts are dried with MgSO4, evaporated to half of the volume, treated with 1000 ml of acetone and the CH2CI2 remaining is distilled off at normal pressure.   After standing in a refrigerator for 2 hours the crystals are filtered off under suction and dried at 50°C overnight.  There is thus obtained   4,6-dichIoro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidine, melting point 178-180°C.<br>
e)	A solution of 17.4 g of 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidine in 100 ml of CH3CN is boiled at reflux for 3 hours with 15 ml of a 32% peracetic acid solution, thereafter cooled and stored in a refrigerator overnight. The crystals are filtered off under suction and dried at 50°C under reduced pressure.   There is thus obtained 4-[4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyridine   1 -oxide, melting point 189-190°C.<br>
f)	A solution of 36.4 g of 4-[4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyridine 1-oxide and 52.8 g of p-tert-butylphenyl-sulphonamide potassium in 150 ml of abs. DMF is stirred at room temperature for 24 hours.   Thereafter, it is poured into a mixture of 1 500 ml of H2O and 1000 ml of ether while stirring mechanically, whereby a precipitate forms.   The suspension is adjusted to pH 5 with CH3COOH, suction filtered, the crystals are washed with cold water and thereafter with<br><br>
ether and dried at 50oC.   There is thus obtained 4-[4-(4-tert-butyl-phenylsulphonylamino)-6-chloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-2-yl]-pyridine 1-oxide as a colourless material of melting point 247-2490C.<br>

The oily residue is taken up in 1000 ml of EtOAc and the solution is washed with CH3COOH:H2O 9:1 and then with H2O. The EtOAc extracts are dried with Na2SO4.   After evaporation of the solvent the residue is taken up in a mixture of CH3CN and CF3COOH (20:1), whereby a crystalline precipitate separates. There is thus obtained 4-tert-butyl-N-[2-(2-cyano-pyridin-4-yl)-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-benzenesulphonamide of melting point 176-179°C.<br>
Example 3<br>

The majority of the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure, the residue is dissolved in H2O, the solution is extracted four times at pH 6.5 with ether, thereafter treated with CH3COOH to pH = 4.5 and extracted with EtOAc. After working up there is obtained a residue which is treated with ether and filtered off under suction therefrom.   There is thus obtained  4-tert-butyl-N-[6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(2-1H-tetrazol-5-yl-pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-benzenesulphonamide, melting point 225-227°C.<br><br>

amide in 600 ml of abs. dioxan is added dropwise within<br>
60 minutes while stirring a cold solution of 22.0 g of 2-pyridyl-carbonyl azide in 200 ml of dioxan.   After 4 hours the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure, the residue is taken up in 300 ml of EtOAc and left to stand at room temperature overnight. The crystalline mass is filtered off under suction and washed with EtOAc.   After repeated recrystallization from tetrahydro-furan and EtOAc and drying under reduced pressure firstly at 450C for 3 days and thereafter at 65°C for a further 2 days there is obtained  2-[6-(4-tert-butyl-phenylsulphonylamino)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(2-1H-tetrazol-5-yl-pyridin-4-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-oxy]-ethyl  pyridin-2-ylcarbamate,   melting  point from 214°C with very slow decomposition.<br>
b)	The 2-pyridyl-carbonyI azide used as the starting material<br>
can be prepared as follows:<br>
A solution of 53.9 g of 2-picolinic acid in 330 ml of abs. DMF and 61.2 ml of triethylamine is treated dropwise within 30 minutes at 10°C with 99.7 ml of diphenylphosphoryl azide.   After 2 hours at room temperature the solution is evaporated for the most part at 30oC under reduced pressure, the oily residue is treated with 200 ml of a 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and exhaustively extracted with ether.   The ethereal extracts are combined, dried with MgSO4 and evaporated at room temperature under reduced pressure.   The yellowish oily residue is cooled in an ice bath at 0-5°C and the crystals are washed at -20oC with a 1:1 mixture of ether and hexane.   There is thus obtained 2-pyridyl-carbonyl azide as colourless crystals of melting point 39-41 oC.<br><br>
Example 5<br>

THF is treated dropwise with a cold solution of 2.8 g of sodium in 50 ml of methanol, whereby there forms gradually a solid precipitate which, after stirring at room temperature for<br>
1	hour, is filtered off under suction, dried under greatly reduced<br>
pressure at 35°C for 3 days and thereafter at 50oC for 2 days.<br>
There is thus obtained the bis-sodium salt, decomposition point<br>
above 250oC.<br>
Example 6<br>
The same tetrazole as in Example 3 is obtained starting from the same starting material as in Example 3 in a one-pot reaction (3 steps) under the following conditions:<br>
2.4 ml of a 1 .ON sodium methylate solution are added at room temperature to a suspension of 1.15 g (2 mmol) of 4-tert-butyl-N-[2-(2-cyano-pyridin-4-yl)-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-benzenesulphonamide  in 50 ml of abs. MeOH.   The clear yellowish solution which results therefrom is held at 40oC for 3 days.<br>
The solution of the iminoether is slowly added dropwise at room temperature within 30 minutes to a suspension of 302 mg (4.4 mmol) of HzN-NHz-HCI in 10 ml of abs. MeOH, whereby a crystalline precipitate separates gradually.   The suspension is cooled to 2°C while stirring further and treated with 15 ml of l.ON HCI.  The clear yellowish solution (pH = 1.7) is treated dropwise with a solution of 800 mg (11.6 mmol) of NaNOz in 10 ml of H2O in such a manner that the temperature does not exceed 5°C (pH 2.7).  After 1   hour a further 2 ml of 1N HCI are added and then a solution of 200 mg (2.9 mmol) of NaNOz in 2 ml of H2O is added.   The solution is left at room temperature for<br>
2	hours, the MeOH is evaporated under reduced pressure and the<br><br>
suspension remaining behind is extracted with EtOAc.   The combined EtOAc solutions are firstly washed twice with H2O and thereafter carefully extracted with a 0.5N NaHCO3-H2O solution. The combined aqueous (NaHCO3) solutions are carefully treated with 3N HCI (to pH = 2) and the suspension is extracted with EtOAc as usual.   After evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure there is obtained a crystalline residue which is identical with the product obtained in Example 3.<br>
