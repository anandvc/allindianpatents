Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to a hydraulically operated emergency elevator operating system FIG. 1. This invention provides a system fitted to the elevator such as elevators operated by electric motor to evacuate people when main power supply fails or even during fire hazards. In the existing/conventional system, the main problem faced is during power failures when the elevator gets stuck in between two floors and causes a lot of inconvenience to commuters.<br>
In the present day condition of frequent power failure, stoppage of elevator in between two floors is causing problems for the people. More over when the power failure is because of fire hazard, the situation is even worst, as the use of back up system like generators and invertors is not possible. In the existing elevators, the commonly used practice is to call the watchman who moves the elevator to the nearest floor, which is very time consuming, laborious and difficult task; another method used is that the watchman comes and opens the door of the elevator and commuters have to jump out of the hanging elevator, which is very dangerous.<br>
To overcome the above-mentioned   drawbacks in the existing system of elevators, it was necessitated to develop a system that could be installed in the existing system to work in emergency, when the elevator is held up in between two floors, to bring the elevator to the immediate lower floor.<br>
The principle object of this invention is that it operates during any kind of power failure, which may be due to power cuts or due to an emergency like fire or earthquake.<br>
According to another object of this invention, it operates when the fuse of the main motor 22 fails.<br>
According to another object of this invention, the system does not come into operation unless actuated manually by the commuters inside the elevator cabin 19.<br>
According to another objective of this invention, the elevator cabin 19 should detach from the elevator head 5 and lower down itself to the immediate lower floor so as to allow the commuters inside the elevator cabin to come out of the elevator safely and with minimum wastage of time.<br>
According to another objective of this invention the elevator cabin detaches itself from elevator head 5 and lowers to the immediate lower floor.<br>
According to another objective of this invention, as soon as the system comes into operation, the main power supply is diverted from the main motor 22 to a pump 7 necessary to restore the system to its original position and return the power to the main motor only after the elevator cabin reaches back to its original position.<br><br>
According to yet another object of the invention, the functional or the operating mechanism used is hydraulically operated FIG. 1 and therefore is much more reliable than any other electrically or pneumatically operated systems.<br>
Thus, in accordance with this invention, the hydraulic emergency elevator evacuation system comprises of two cylinder piston arrangement FIG 1 which connects the elevator head to the elevator cabin, so as to comfortably detach the elevator cabin from the elevator head and lower the elevator cabin to the immediate lower floor in the event of power failure and the system being manually actuated by the commuter/s inside the elevator cabin.<br>
The various subunits of the system, namely, the cabin, the hydraulic cylinders, the circuits for actuating two solenoid valves and the circuit to switch power supply from the main motor to the pump and the pump to the main motor have been shown in the figure 1, figure2, flgure3, figure4 and figure 5 of the accompanying drawings which make the net operation of the system come into effect.<br>
This invention relates to the hydraulic system installed in an elevator. This system can be installed in an elevator configuration with modifications required in the elevator car.<br>
Prior Art<br>
In prior art, whenever there is a power failure the watchman reaches to the floor where elevator is stuck and manually moves the elevator till it reaches the nearest floor. Another method practiced is in which the watchman opens the door directly with the help of a key and the passengers have to jump out of the elevator in its hanging position. This method is very dangerous and may lead to accidents.<br>
In buildings where there is provision of a power back up, there is no requirement of watchman for rescuing the passengers, but then criticality of situation becomes even worse in such case. Problems like fire and failure in electric wiring and minor problems in the main suspensions can be very dangerous in this case.<br>
The present invention is unique from the prior art in the following manner:<br>
1.	The present invention relates to a hydraulically operated lift evacuation system, whereas in the existing system the system is manually operated and a mechanical system for evacuation using ropes of already existing elevator system.<br>
2.	In the present invention the lift cabin detaches itself from the lift head and lowers to the immediate lower floor, whereas in the existing system the complete lift (that is Lift head and cabin) is lowered to the immediate lower floor through top suspension ropes.<br>
3.	In the present invention hydraulic cylinders are used to lower the detached lift cabin to the immediate lower floor, whereas in the existing system no hydraulic   v system is used for evacuation purpose.<br>
4.	In the present invention no back-up power supply is used whereas in the existing systems a back-up power supply is used for moving the lift.<br><br>
5.	In the present invention modification in the lift body is done to install hydraulic system and to put proximity sensor, whereas in the existing system there is no such modification.<br>
6.	In the present invention a separate system that is a hydraulic system is used for evacuation purpose apart from main pulling system (mechanical), whereas in the present system (hydraulic lifts) the hydraulic system of the hydraulically operated lift is used for controlling purpose in case of emergency or otherwise.<br>
Aim of the system<br>
The aim of the devised system is to bring the elevator cabin safely in front of the immediate lower floor, so that the passengers can safely come out of the elevator without the help of the liftman. This would also reduce the time delay caused due the subsequent existing operations.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The system comes into operation when there is any kind of electric power failure. The system also comes into operation when there are fire hazards. This is a passenger-actuated system and will not come into action if the elevator cabin is empty. Once the system comes into operation the electric supply to the motor is cut off and is not restored till the elevator cabin comes back to its original configuration. When the system is actuated, the elevator cabin detaches itself from the elevator head and lowers itself with the help of hydraulic cylinders til! it reaches the immediate lower floor. After lowering, the elevator stops exactly in front of the lower floor, i.e. its correct position. The door automatically unlocks, as (in case of most of the elevators) the door is designed to unlock when the elevator is in the correct position as stated above. The passengers can now come out of the elevator.<br>
The elevator remains in this extended form till the electricity is restored. When the electric supply is restored the elevator cabin, is lifted up back to its original configuration as shown in figure 1 with the help of the hydraulic cylinders. The power supply is then diverted back to the motor. As the system operates hydraulically, it is highly reliable.<br>

FIG. 5 shows the connection of the main pulling motor 22 and the pump 7 to the proximity sensorl8 through circuit 25. the figure shows the control of main pulling motor 22 and pump 7 by proximity sensor 18 through circuit 25. This figure shows the arrangement by which the main power supply is diverted to the pump 7 after the system is activated and back to the main motor 22, after the lift come back to it original configuration.<br>
Working of the invention:<br>
When the power supply is un-interrupted, the elevator runs in a normal manner. Due to power failure, the elevator may halt in between two floors or in a rare occurrence, at a proper floor. If the elevator halts at a proper floor i.e. the elevator stops completely in front of a door, the people can come out immediately without any problem. This is because the doors unlock only when the cabin is in front of the door. If elevator halts in-between two floors (say forth &amp; third floor), hydraulic system comes into action.<br>
The commuter/s inside the elevator need/s to actuate the system by pushing a press button 12. As the press button 12 is pressed, the elevator cabin 19 detaches from the elevator head 5 and starts lowering with the help of cylinder-piston arrangement, the piston cylinder 1,2 arrangement is shown in FIG. 1. Pressing the press button 12 generates a 5V signal that actuates solenoid valve 13 operating at 24V, operated with the help of solenoid valve controller 20 shown in FIG. 3. As the solenoid valve 13 opens the weight of the elevator will push the oil below the piston 2 into the oil sump 8 and back to the upper part of the cylinder 1. This causes the elevator to lower itself to the immediate lower floor.<br>
The power supply to the main motor 22 is cut and diverted to a pump so that when the power supply is restored, the power is first delivered to the pump 7 and not to the main motor 22. This is done with circuit 25 as shown in FIG. 5. This lowering continues till proximity sensor 11 placed at the bottom of the elevator cabin 19 generates a 5V signal to close the solenoid valve 13. This circuit 23 has been shown in FIG. 3. The elevator doors unlock when the cabin 19 is in front of the floor. The elevator doors are opened manually to allow the commuters out of the elevator safely. The elevator remains in this position in stable condition till the power supply is back. When the power supplies returns, another 5Vsignal from the main electric supply triggers the solenoid valve controller 21 to open the solenoid valve 14.<br>
The signal (from the main electric supply) actuates the pump 7 to pump the liquid back into the cylinder to cause the detached elevator cabin 19 to rise. The elevator<br><br>
cabin 19 rises till proximity sensor 18 placed near the elevator head closes the solenoid valve 14 with circuit 24 as shown in FIG. 4 and stops the elevator.<br>
If the power supply returns while the elevator is lowering, the electricity is first diverted to the pump 7 which pumps back the liquid to the cylinders 1 and the power returns to the main motor only after the elevator cabin 19 is at its original position.<br><br>
