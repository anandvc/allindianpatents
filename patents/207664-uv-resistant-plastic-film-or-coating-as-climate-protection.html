UV-resistant plastic film or coating as climate protection<br>
The present invention refers to a UV-resistant plastic film or coating on another carrier material and which in particular is intended as climate protection for example to be used in connection with plant growing, specially in greenhouse curtains, greenhouse films and .over material for outdoor growing, awning etc. These films have a major problem concerning their useful life, since the film is exposed to sunlight and to several chemicals used in for example plant growing.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
To increase the life of such films it is known to use a light stabiliser of the kind which hindering amines (HALS- Hindered Amines Light Stabiliser). This is described in for example EP-A 0,214,507. These are very god stabilisers for thin films with long expected lifetimes. They are often combined with other types of stabilisers and also with UV-absorbents to further increase the life. The hindering amines are very reactive and quickly take care of the degradation products that are formed, and they are basic. This makes it easy for them to react with foreign substances which come in contact with the film and particular substances that are acidic, e.g. sulphur-, chlorine- and bromine-based compounds. In some greenhouses such chemicals are extensively used to protect the plant from various diseases and insects. When the hindering amines react with these chemicals their effects are lost and the film's UV-protection is knocked out. Some greenhouse film producers are limiting their warranties for the films life in connection with or exposure during longer periods of time for the following groups and substances, insecticides, fungicides etc., more specifically substances containing bromine, chlorine, flour, iodine, sulphur, petroleum-products and wood protecting agent containing copper.<br>
It is also known that films and coatings obtain shorter lives when they are exposed to so called acid rain, which may apply to awnings placed in environment with high level of air pollution. The producer of HALS-stabilisers market some types of stabilisers, that shall be suitable in such environments, so called 'acid rain resistant', but tests have shown that their eftectiveness does not differ much from the other HALS-stabilisers.<br><br>
said to have high tensile strength and to be transparent and heat-resistant. The film is made of EVA to which an unsaturated alkoxysilane has been grafted with help of a peroxide, whereafter the polymer was crosslinked. At the grafting the polymer chain is opened up with the peroxide where the silane-group is attached, which later is crosslinked. There is no information about any UV-resistance of this film and in our own experiments, (below) it is shown thut such silane grafted polyolefin does not huvc desired UV-rcsistuncc.<br>
Fires can start in curtain structures in greenhouses and may spread very rapidly. A desire is therefor to obtain flame proof material, which also must fulfil all the other expectations such as UV-protection, long life etc. of greenhouse curtains.<br>
Object of the invention and its most important characteristics<br>
The purpose with the present invention is to obtain a material suitable for plastic film or coating on another carrier material in greenhouse curtains, greenhouse films and cover material for out door greenhouse growing. As mentioned above, it may also have applications in other products, for example awnings and Venetian blinds, since these may too be exposed to acidic environment. The material shall be UV-stabile and not or only in very small degree be effected by exposure to the chemicals they are normally exposed to in a greenhouse environment and, it should also in some cases be flame resistant.<br>
This has according to the present invention been obtained by using a film or a coating, which wholly or partially contains a crosslinked polyolefin-silane-co-polymer. Hereby means a copolymer where silane groups are placed in the polyolefin chain in a polymerisation process in difference to a grafted polymer where the polyolefin chain is opened up for example by a peroxide, whereafter the silane groups are placed and crosslinked.<br>
Crosslinking of polyolefin-silane-co-polymer is performed preferably by the influence of water and a silaneol condensations catalyst.<br><br>
The polyolefin consists of preferably a polyethylene, for example low-density polyethylene, LDPE or some of its co-polymers for example EVA or EBA. The higher UV-stability is surprising since the material is almost an ordinary polyolefin co-polymer with the only difference that the molecules are crosslinked to each other, while properties such as crystallinity are almost unchanged. The polyolefin, preferably of the group polyethylene, can also contain one or more other co-monomers in addition to the silane-groups. Examples of such co-monomers are vinyl acetate, butyl acrylate, 1-buten and 1-okten.<br>
In a multilayer film shall at least one of the layers consist of the crosslinked polyolefin-silane-co-polymer according to the invention, but other layers may consist of other materials, such as heat radiation absorbing material.<br>
The film or coating can also be provided with additives. Examples of such additives are pigments, which make it transparent to some wave lengths of the sun light, and anti-fog agents such as glycerol stearate, glycerol ester or other products to avoid condense drops. The anti-fog agent might only be added to the outer layer. The film may also be of cellular type, where the ferment - or blow agent, organic or inorganic, is mixed in to the plastic when the film is produced, which creates cavities, closed or connected, when the blow agent is developed. Other examples of additives are mincible thermoplastics, stabilisation agent, lubricant and flame protective agents.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
By the crosslinking of tha polyolefin-silane-co-polymer an endless three-dimensional molecular structure is built up, which gives the material advantages such as:<br>
â€¢	higher resistance to UV-radiation;<br>
â€¢	higher chemical resistance;<br>
â€¢	higher heat resistance;<br>
â€¢	memory properties in the material, which results in less shrinking and a lower tendency to form permanent folds;<br>
â€¢	higher break strength;<br>
â€¢	better low temperature properties;<br><br>
â€¢ and combinations of the above mentioned properties.<br>
The polymer composition in the basic chain consists of a polyolefin-co-polymer containing hydrolysable silane groups. Such a polymer composition is described in for example SE-B-462 752.<br>
Desired flame protectiveness is obtained by adding a flame protective agent to the plastic film or its produced strips, which may be composed of a halogen- or phosphor containing compound. These may be used without the level of UV-protection being reduced, which is the case, when using the so called HALS-stabilisers to obtain a satisfying life length. Another alternative is that the carrier m0terial is composed of halogen- or phosphor containing plastic film or strips of such a film, which are treated with a layer of the crosslinked polyolefin-silane-co-polymer.<br>
In the experiments described below a LDPE crosslinked with a vinyl trimetoxi silane is used. This polymer behaves as a 'normal' low density polyethylene with respect to extrusion properties. This mean that the polymer may be extruded to a film on a normal extruder without special rebuilding or additives in the form of special equipment. The crosslinking is obtained after extrusion in the presence of water and a catalyst. The production is described in the example below.<br>
Example 1<br>
Production of a blown film containing a crosslinked polyethylene.<br>
As crosslinked polymer we have used a silane corsslinked LDPE from Borealis, LE 4421, with addition of a catalyst in master batch form called LE 4436. LE 4421 is a commercial copolymer where vinyltrimetoxysilane is polymerised in the chain. We have used 5% catalyst master batch. The polymer and the catalyst were mixed separately just before the extrusion, though this can also be done with the normal mixing equipment as is usually present on the extruder. An advantage with the later method it that one decreases the contact time between<br><br>
the polymer and the catalyst, thereby minimizing the risk for a too early crosslinkage, whicl creates gels in the film.<br>
The polymer and the catalyst master batch were stored protected from damp and moisture at about 20 Â°C, to decrease the risk tor a too early crosslinkage.<br>
The film material with a density of 923 kg/m 3 and a MFR2 of 0,9 g/10 min was run at a temperature setting of the extruder's heat zones of 150-170 Â°C. The screw velocity was 112 rpm which gave a work force of 52 Amp, a melting pressure of 266 bar and a melting temperature of 178 Â°C.<br>
To obtain a film with for us suitable properties, we used a blow up ratio of 1:2. The melting temperature was kept below 180 Â°C to avoid problems with gel formation. To protect the polymer from degradation during the extrusion it was stabilised by process stabilisers in the form of antioxidants.<br>
Example 2<br>
Jgxperiments were made to test the life at different plastic films, that were exposed to UV-radiation and sulphur/sulphur compounds.<br>
The tests performed had as a goal to reflect as far as possible real conditions in greenhouses. ;The samples were first exposed to one day and one night of sulphur using a so called sulphur lamp, whereafter it was exposed in an Atlas Xenon Weather-ometer Ci35 A. The conditions in the Weather-Ometer were: 0,35 W/m 2 at 340 nm, 23 h light/24 h. No water spraying. The conditions should reflect those in Florida. Samples were taken from the Weater-Ometer at regular intervals and were tested in a tensile tester (tensile velocity 100 mm/min) and controlled in an FT-IR to see the carbonyl accumulation at 1718 cm "<br>
The films tested were:<br>
1.	70 micron LDPE + HALS<br>
2.	70 micron crosslinked LDPE-silane-co-polymer.<br><br>
Below are the results obtained. They are based on tensile strength measurements.<br><br>
In experiment A the film samples were exposed only to the Weather-Ometer. In &amp;periment B the samples were first exposed 24 h to a sulphur lamp and thereafter to the Weather- Ometer.<br>
As seen from experiments, the crosslinked film is very UV-stable irrespectively of whether it was exposed to sulphur or not. The uncrosslinked polymer had a good UV-stability when it was not exposed to sulphur, but after exposure the film's UV-stability decreased exponentially. If one wishes to increase the life of the crosslinked polymer it is of course possible to add a HALS-stabiliser to it. The stabiliser's effect at acidic environments may however be questioned.<br>
Example 3<br>
The experiment was performed to compare the life of plastic films of HDPE, silane grafted HDPE and ethene/vinylsilane-co-polymer which has been exposed to UV-radiation.<br>
The films were exposed in an Atlas Xenon Weather-Ometer Ci35A under the conditions: 0,35 W/m' at 340 nm, 23 h light/24 h. No water spraying. A simple mechanical test was performed continuously during the time the samples were ageing by taking them out and bending them. As long as this could be performed without the film sample broke or fell into pieces, the ageing continued. The time it took until the sample was broke or became fragile, is given in Table 2.<br>
The films tested were:<br><br>
A.	50 micron HDPE<br>
B.	50 micron HDPE + HALS<br>
C.	50 micron silanc grafted HDPE<br>
D.	50 micron siiane grafted HDPE + HALS<br>
E.	70 micron ethylene/vinylsilane co-polymer<br>
f ;F. 50 micron ethylene/vinylsilane co-polymer + HALS G: 50 micron 50/50 (ethylene/vinylsilane co-polymer + HDPE)<br>
H. 50 micron 50/50 (ethylene/vinyl siiane co-polymer + HDPE) + HALS<br>
Below are the results obtained.<br><br>
The material according to the invention can as already mentioned be in the form of a film or in the form of a coating on another carrier material. The thickness is preferably 
The film can be pigmented to obtain selective screening of the sunlight to affect plant growth. With this we mean it is transparent only to some wave lengths of the sunlight. Examples of such pigments are interference pigments as described in WO 95/05727. Also addition of UV-absorbents is a possibility, particularly of benzophenon or benzotriazol type. It may also<br><br>
contain so called anti-fog agents to avoid condensation droplets. The anti-fog agent may be added to only the surface layer of the film.<br>
The film may also be a so called cell type, with which we mean a plastic film where a ferment- or bubble component, organic or inorganic, is mixed in to the plastic when the film is produced, which creates cavities or bubbles, closed or connected, when the bubbling component is broken down.<br>
An example of how the film can be used is as foldable climate protection curtains or awnings of that kind which comprises with each other connected strips. The strips can be either plaited together or with each other and/or connected through a system of yarn threads, for example through a knitting or weaving process. One example of such a climate protection curtain is<br>
â– J-   :<br>
described in EP 0 109 951. The strips shall here at least partly contain the UV-resistant plastic film according to this invention.<br>
Another example on the use of the invention is as foldable water proof climate protection curtains or awnings of the kind that comprises of with each other connected strips, yarn treads or a combination of strips and yarn treads, where the curtain on at least one side has a water proof layer wholly or partially composed of the UV-resistant plastic film according to the Invention.<br>
At least a part of the strips in the climate curtain or awning can be light permeable. The strips may have an additive of a flame protective agent.<br>
The invention is of course not limited to the described examples, but several modifications are possible within the scope of claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
