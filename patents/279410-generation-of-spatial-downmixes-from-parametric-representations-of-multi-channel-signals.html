				<td>Generation of spatial downmixes from parametric<br>
representations of multi channel signals<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to decoding of encoded multi-<br>
channel audio signals based on a parametric multi-channel<br>
representation and in particular to the generation of 2-<br>
channel downmixes providing a spatial listening experience<br>
as for example a headphone compatible down mix or a spatial<br>
downmix for 2 speaker setups.<br>
Background of the Invention in Prior Art<br>
Recent development in audio coding has made available the<br>
ability to recreate a multi-channel representation of an<br>
audio signal based on a stereo (or mono) signal and<br>
corresponding control data. These methods differ<br>
substantially from older matrix based solutions such as<br>
Dolby Prologic, since additional control data is<br>
transmitted to control the re-creation, also referred to<br>
as up-mix, of the surround channels based on the<br>
transmitted mono or stereo channels.<br>
Hence, such a parametric multi-channel audio decoder, e.g.<br>
MPEG Surround, reconstructs N channels based on M<br>
transmitted channels, where N &gt; M, and the additional<br>
control data. The additional control data represents a<br>
significant lower data rate than transmitting the all N<br>
channels, making the coding very efficient while at the<br>
same time ensuring compatibility with both M channel<br>
devices and N channel devices.<br>
These parametric surround coding methods usually comprise<br>
a parameterization of the surround signal based on IID<br>
(Inter channel intensity Difference) or CLD (Channel Level<br>
 <br>
Difference) and ICC (Inter Channel Coherence). These<br>
parameters describe power ratios and correlations, between<br>
channel pairs in the up-mix process. Further parameters<br>
also used in prior art comprise prediction parameters used<br>
to predict intermediate or output channels during the up-<br>
mix procedure.<br>
Other developments in reproduction of multi-channel audio<br>
content have provided means to obtain a spatial listening<br>
impression using stereo headphones. To achieve a spatial<br>
listening experience using only the two speakers of the<br>
headphones, multi-channel signals are down mixed to stereo<br>
signals using HRTF (head related transfer functions),<br>
intended to take into account the extremely complex<br>
transmission characteristics of a human head for providing<br>
the spatial listening experience.<br>
Another related approach is to use a conventional 2-channel<br>
playback environment and to filter the channels of a multi-<br>
channel audio signal with appropriate filters to achieve a<br>
listening experience close to that of the playback with the<br>
original number of speakers. The processing of the signals<br>
is similar as in the case of headphone playback to create<br>
an appropriate "spatial stereo down mix" having the desired<br>
properties. Contrary to the headphone case, the signal of<br>
both speakers directly reaches both ears of a listener,<br>
causing undesired "crosstalk effects". As this has to be<br>
taken into account for optimal reproduction quality, the<br>
filters used for signal processing are commonly called<br>
crosstalk-cancellation filters. Generally, the aim of this<br>
technique is to extend the possible range of sound sources<br>
outside the stereo speaker base by cancellation of inherent<br>
crosstalk using complex crosstalk-cancellation filters.<br>
Because of the complex filtering, HRTF filters are very<br>
long, i.e. they may comprise several hundreds of filter<br>
taps each. For the same reason, it is hardly possible to<br>
find a parameterization of the filters that works well<br>
 <br>
enough not to degrade the perceptual quality when used<br>
instead of the actual filter.<br>
Thus, on the one hand, bit. saving parametric<br>
representations of multi-channel signals do exist that<br>
allow for an efficient transport of an encoded multi-<br>
channel signal. On the other hand, elegant ways to create a<br>
spatial listening experience for a multi-channel signal<br>
when using stereo headphones or stereo speakers only are<br>
known. However, these require the full number of channels<br>
of the multi-channel signal as input for the application of<br>
the head related transfer functions that create the<br>
headphone down mix signal. Thus, either the full set of<br>
multi-channels signals has to be transmitted or a<br>
parametric representation has to be fully reconstructed<br>
before applying the head related transfer functions or the<br>
crosstalk-cancellation filters and thus either the<br>
transmission bandwidth or the computational complexity is<br>
unacceptably high.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

channel having a lower level; and a synthesizer for<br>

representation of the down mix signal.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a<br>
headphone down mix signal can be derived from a parametric<br>
down mix of a multi-channel signal, when a filter<br>
calculator is used for deriving modified HRTFs (head<br>
 <br>
related transfer functions) from original HRTFs of the<br>
multi-channel signal and when the filter converter uses a<br>
level parameter having information on a level relation<br>
between two channels of the multi-channel signal such that<br>
modified HRTFs are stronger influenced by the HRTF of a<br>
channel having a higher level than by the HRTF of a channel<br>
having a lower level. Modified HRTFs are derived during the<br>
decoding process taking into account the relative strength<br>
of the channels associated to the HRTFs. The original HRTFs<br>
are modified such, that a down mix signal of a parametric<br>
representation of a multi-channel signal can be directly<br>
used to synthesize the headphone down mix signal without<br>
the need of a full parametric multi-channel reconstruction<br>
of the parametric down mix signal.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, an inventive<br>
decoder is used implementing a parametric multi-channel<br>
reconstruction as well as an inventive binaural<br>
reconstruction of a transmitted parametric down mix of an<br>
original multi-channel signal. According to the present<br>
invention, a full reconstruction of the multi-channel<br>
signal prior to binaural down mixing is not required,<br>
having the obvious great advantage of a strongly reduced<br>
computational complexity. This allows, for example, mobile<br>
devices having only limited energy reservoirs to extend the<br>
playback length significantly. A further advantage is that<br>
the same device can serve as provider for complete multi-<br>
channel signals (for example 5.1, 7.1, 7.2 signals) as well<br>
as for a binaural down mix of the signal having a spatial<br>
listening experience even when using only two-speaker<br>
headphones. This might, for example, be extremely<br>
advantageous in home-entertainment configurations.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention a filter<br>
calculator is used for deriving modified HRTFs not only<br>
operative to combine the HRTFs of two channels by applying<br>
individual weighting factors to the HRTF but by introducing<br>
additional phase factors for each HRTF to be combined. The<br>
 <br>
introduction of the phase factor has the advantage of<br>
achieving a delay compensation of two filters prior to<br>
their superposition or combination. This leads to a<br>
combined response that models a main delay time<br>
corresponding to an intermediate position between the front<br>
and the back speakers.<br>
A second advantage is that a gain factor, which has to be<br>
applied during the combination of the filters to ensure<br>
energy conservation, is much more stable with respect to<br>
its behavior with frequency than without the introduction<br>
of the phase factor. This is particular relevant for the<br>
inventive concept, as according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention a representation of a down mix of a<br>
multi-channel signal is processed within a interbank<br>
domain to derive the headphone down mix signal. As such,<br>
different frequency bands of the representation of the down<br>
mix signal are to be processed separately and therefore, a<br>
smooth behavior of the individually applied gain functions<br>
is vital.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the head-<br>
related transfer functions are converted to subband-filters<br>
for the subband domains such that the total number of<br>
modified HRTFs used in the subband domain is smaller than<br>
the total number of original HRTFs. This has the evident<br>
advantage that the computational complexity for deriving<br>
headphone down mixed signals is even decreased compared to<br>
the down mixing using standard HRTF filters.<br>
Implementing the inventive concept allows for the use of<br>
extremely long HRTFs and thus allows for the reconstruction<br>
of headphone down mix signals based on a representation of<br>
a parametric down mix of a multi-channel signal with<br>
excellent perceptual quality.<br>
Furthermore, using the inventive concept on crosstalk-<br>
cancellation filters allows for the generation of a spatial<br>
 <br>
stereo down mix to be used with a standard 2 speaker setup<br>
based on a representation of a parametric down mix of a<br>
multi-channel signal with excellent perceptual quality.<br>
One further big advantage.of the inventive decoding concept<br>
is that a single inventive binaural decoder implementing<br>
the inventive concept may be used to derive a binaural<br>
downmix as well as a multi-channel reconstruction of a<br>
transmitted down mix taking into account the additionally<br>
transmitted spatial parameters.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention an inventive<br>
binaural decoder is having an analysis filterbank for<br>
deriving the representation of the down mix of the multi-<br>
channel signal in a subband domain and an inventive decoder<br>
implementing the calculation of the modified HRTFs. The<br>
decoder further comprises a synthesis filterbank to<br>
finally derive a time domain representation of a headphone<br>
down mix signal, which is ready to be played back by any<br>
conventional audio playback equipment.<br>
In the following paragraphs, prior art parametric multi-<br>
channel decoding schemes and binaural decoding schemes are<br>
explained in more detail referencing the accompanying<br>
drawings, to more clearly outline the great advantages of<br>
the inventive concept.<br>
Most of the embodiments of the present invention detailed<br>
below describe the inventive concept using HRTFs. As<br>
previously noted, HRTF processing is similar to the use of<br>
crosstalk-cancellation filters. Therefore, all of the<br>
embodiments are to be understood as to refer to HRTF<br>
processing as well as to crosstalk-cancellation filters. In<br>
other words, all HRTF Filters could be replaced by<br>
crosstalk-cancellation filters below to apply the inventive<br>
concept to the use of crosstalk-cancellation filters.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The below-described embodiments are merely illustrative<br>
for the principles of the present invention for Binaural<br>
 <br>
Decoding of Multi-Channel Signals By Morphed HRTF<br>
Filtering. It is understood that modifications and<br>
variations of the arrangements and the details described<br>
herein will be apparent to others skilled in the art. It<br>
is the intent, therefore, to be limited only by the scope<br>
of the impending patent claims and not by the specific<br>
details presented by way of description and explanation of<br>
the embodiments herein.<br>
In order to better outline the features and advantages of<br>
the present invention a more elaborate description of prior<br>
art will be given now.<br>
A conventional binaural synthesis algorithm is outlined in<br>
Fig. 1. A set of input channels (left front (LF} , right<br>
front (RF), left surround (LS), right surround (RS) and<br>
center (C) ), 10a, 10b, 10c, lOd and lOe is filtered by a<br>
set of HRTFs 12a to 12j. Each input signal is split into<br>
two signals (a left "L" and a right "R" component! wherein<br>
each of these signal components is subsequently filtered by<br>
an HRTF corresponding to the desired sound position.<br>
Finally, all left ear signals are summed by a summer 14a to<br>
generate the left binaural output signal L and the right-<br>
ear signals are summed by a summer 14b to generate the<br>
right binaural output signal R. It may be noted that HR'EF<br>
convolution can principally be performed in the time<br>
domain, but it is often preferred to perform filtering in<br>
the frequency domain due to the increased computational<br>
efficiency. That means that, the summation shown in Fig- 1<br>
is also performed in the frequency domain and a subsequent<br>
transformation into a time domain is additionally required.<br>
Fig. 1b illustrates crosstalk cancellation processing<br>
intended to achieve a spatial listening impression using<br>
only two speakers of a standard stereo playback<br>
environment.<br>
 <br>
The aim is reproduction of a multi-channel signal by means<br>
of a stereo playback system having only two speakers 16a<br>
and 16b such that a listener 18 experiences a spatial<br>
listening experience. Am major difference with respect to<br>
headphone reproduction is that signals of both speakers 16a<br>
and 16b directly reach both ears of listener 18. The<br>
signals indicated by dashed lines (crosstalk) therefore<br>
have to be taken into account additionally.<br>
For ease of explanation only a 3 channel input signal<br>
having 3 sources 20a to 20c is illustrated in Fig. 1b. It<br>
goes without saying that the scenario can in principle be<br>
extended to arbitrary number of channels.<br>
To derive the stereo signal to be played back, each input<br>
source is processed by 2 of the crosstalk cancellation<br>
filters 21a to 2lf, one filter for each channel of the<br>
playback signal. Finally, all filtered signals for the left<br>
playback channel 16a and the right playback channel 16b are<br>
summed up for playback. It is evident that the crosstalk<br>
cancellation filters will in general be different for each<br>
source 20a and 20b (depending on its desired perceived<br>
position) and that they could furthermore even depend on<br>
the listener.<br>
Owing to the high flexibility of the inventive concept, one<br>
benefits from high flexibility in the design and<br>
application of the crosstalk cancellation filters such<br>
that filters can be optimized for each application or<br>
playback device individually. One further advantage is that<br>
the method is computationally extremely efficient, since<br>
only 2 synthesis filterbanks are required.<br>
A principle sketch of a spatial audio encoder is shown in<br>
Fig. 2. In such a basic encoding scenario., a spatial audio<br>
decoder 40 comprises a spatial encoder 42, a down mix<br>
encoder 44 and a multiplexer 46.<br>
 <br>
A multi-channel input signal 50 is analyzed by the spatial<br>
encoder 42, extracting spatial parameters describing<br>
spatial properties of the multi-channel input signal that<br>
have to be transmitted to the decoder side. The down mixed<br>
signal generated by the spatial encoder 42 may for example<br>
be a monophonic or a stereo signal depending on different<br>
encoding scenarios. The down mix encoder 4 4 may then encode<br>
the monophonic or stereo down mix signal using any<br>
conventional mono or stereo audio coding scheme. The<br>
multiplexer 46 creates an output bit stream by combining<br>
the spatial parameters and the encoded down mix signal into<br>
the output bit stream.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a possible direct combination of a multi-<br>
channel decoder corresponding to the encoder of Fig. 2 and<br>
a binaural synthesis method as, for example, outlined in<br>
Fig. 1. As can be seen, the prior art approach of combining<br>
the features is simple and straight forward. The set-up<br>
comprises a de-multiplexer 60, a down mix decoder 62, a<br>
spatial decoder 64 and a binaural synthesizer 66. An input<br>
bit stream 68 is de-multiplexed resulting in spatial<br>
parameters 70 and a down mix signal bit stream. The latter<br>
down-mix signal bit stream is decoded by the down mix<br>
decoder 62 using a conventional mono or stereo decoder. The<br>
decoded down mix is input, together with the spatial<br>
parameters 70, into the spatial decoder 64 that generates a<br>
multi-channel output signal 72 having the spatial<br>
properties indicated by the spatial parameters 70. Having a<br>
multi-channel signal 72 completely reconstructed, the<br>
approach of simply adding a binaural synthesizer 66 to<br>
implement the binaural synthesis concept of Fig. 1 is<br>
straight-forward. Therefore, the multi-channel output<br>
signal 72 is used as an input for the binaural synthesizer<br>
66 which processes the multi-channel output signal to<br>
derive the resulting binaural output signal 74. The<br>
approach shown in Fig. 3 has at least three disadvantages:<br>
 <br>
a complete multi-channel signal representation has to<br>
be computed as an intermediate step, followed by HRTF<br>
convolution and down mixing in the binaural synthesis.<br>
Although HRTF convolution should be performed on a per<br>
channel basis, given the fact that each audio channel<br>
can have a different spatial position, this is an<br>
undesirable situation from a complexity point of view.<br>
Thus, computational complexity is high and energy is<br>
wasted.<br>
The spatial decoder operates in a filterbank (QMF)<br>
domain. HRTF convolution, on the other hand, is<br>
typically applied in the FFT domain. Therefore, a<br>
cascade of a multi-channel QMF synthesis filterbank, a<br>
multi-channel DFT transform, and a stereo inverse DFT<br>
transform is necessary, resulting in a system with<br>
high computational demands.<br>
Coding artefacts created by the spatial decoder to<br>
create a multi-channel reconstruction will be audible,<br>
and possibly enhanced in the (stereo) binaural output.<br>
An even more detailed description of multi-channel encoding<br>
and decoding is given in Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
The spatial encoder 100 shown in Fig. 4 comprises a first<br>
OTT (1-to-2-encoder) 102a, a second OTT 102b and a TTT box<br>
(3-to-2-encoder) 104. A multi-channel input signal 106<br>
consisting of LF, LS, C, RF, RS (left-front, left-<br>
surround, center, right-front and right-surround) channels<br>
is processed by the spatial encoder 100. The OTT boxes<br>
receive two input audio channels each, and derive a single<br>
monophonic audio output channel and associated spatial<br>
parameters, the parameters having information on the<br>
spatial properties of the original channels with respect to<br>
one another or with respect to the output channel (for<br>
example CLD, ICC, parameters) . In the encoder 100, the LF<br>
and the LS channels are processed by OTT encoder 102a and<br>
 <br>
the RF and RS channels are processed by the OTT encoder<br>
102b. Two signals, L and R are generated, the one only<br>
having information on the left side and the other only<br>
having information on the right side. The signals L, R and<br>
C are further processed by the TTT encoder 104, generating<br>
a stereo down mix and additional parameters.<br>
The parameters resulting from the TTT encoder typically<br>
consist of a pair of prediction coefficients for each<br>
parameter band, or a pair of level differences to describe<br>
the energy ratios of the three input signals. The<br>
parameters of the 'OTT' encoders consist of level<br>
differences and coherence or cross-correlation values<br>
between the input signals for each frequency band.<br>
It may be noted that although the schematic sketch of the<br>
spatial encoder 100 points to a sequential processing of<br>
the individual channels of the down mix signal during the<br>
encoding, it is also possible to implement the complete<br>
down mixing process of the encoder 100 within one single<br>
matrix operation.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a corresponding spatial decoder, receiving as<br>
an input the down mix signals as provided by the encoder of<br>
Fig. 4 and the corresponding spatial parameters.<br>
The spatial decoder 120 comprises a 2-to-3-decoder 122 and<br>
1-to-2-decoders 124a to 124c. The down mix signals Lo and Ro<br>
are input into the 2-to-3-decoder 122 that recreates a<br>
center channel C, a right channel R and a left channel L.<br>
These three channels are further processed by the OTT-<br>
decoders 124a to 124c yielding six output channels. It may<br>
be noted that the derivation of a low-frequency enhancement<br>
channel LFE is not mandatory and can be omitted such that<br>
one single OTT-encoder may be saved within the surround<br>
decoder 120 shown in Fig. 5.<br>
 <br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention the<br>
ihventive concept is applied in a decoder as shown in Fig.<br>
6. The inventive decoder 200 comprises a 2-to-3-decoder 104<br>
and six HRTF-filters 106a to 106f. A stereo input signal<br>
(Lo, Ro) is processed by the TTT-decoder 104, deriving<br>
three signals L, C and R. It may be noted, that the stereo<br>
input signal is assumed to be delivered within a subband<br>
domain, since the TTT-encoder may be the same encoder as<br>
shown in Fig. 5 and hence adapted to be operative on<br>
subband signals. The signals L, R and C are subject to HRTF<br>
parameter processing by the HRTF filters 106a to 106f.<br>
The resulting 6 channels are summed to generate the stereo<br>
binaural output pair (Lb, Rb) .<br>
The TTT decoder, 106, can be described as the following<br>
matrix operation:<br>
 <br>
with matrix entries mxy dependent on the spatial<br>
parameters. The relation of spatial parameters and matrix<br>
entries is identical to those relations as in the 5.1-<br>
multichannel MPEG surround decoder. Each of the three<br>
resulting signals L, R, and C are split in two and<br>
processed with HRTF parameters corresponding to the desired<br>
(perceived) position of these sound sources. For the center<br>
channel (C), the spatial parameters of the sound source<br>
position can be applied directly, resulting in two output<br>
signals for the center, LB(C) and RB(C):<br>
 <br>
For the left (L) channel, the HFTF parameters from the<br>
left-front and left-surround channels are combined into a<br>
single HRTF parameter set, using the weights wlf and wrt•<br>
 <br>
The resulting 'composite' HRTF parameters simulate the<br>
effect of both the front and surround channels in a<br>
statistical sense. The following equations are used to<br>
generate the binaural output pair (IB, RB) for the left<br>
channel:<br>
 <br>
In a similar fashion, the binaural output for the right<br>
channel is obtained according to:<br>
 <br>
Given the above definitions of LA{C), RB(C), LB(L), RB{L),<br>
LB(R) and RS(R), the complete LB and RB signals can be<br>
derived from a single 2 by 2 matrix given the stereo input<br>
signal:<br>
 <br>
In the above it was assumed that the Hr(X) elements, for<br>
Y= L0,R0 and X = L,R,C, were complex scalars. However, the<br>
present invention teaches how to extend the approach of a 2<br>
by 2 matrix binaural decoder to handle arbitrary length<br>
HRTF filters. In order to achieve this, the present<br>
invention comprises the following steps:<br>
 <br>
•	Transform the HRTF filter responses to a filterbank<br>
domain;<br>
•	Overall delay difference or phase difference<br>
extraction from HRTF filter pairs;<br>
•	Morph the responses of the HRTF filter pair as a<br>
function- of the CLD parameters<br>
•	Gain adjustment<br>
This is achieved by replacing the six complex gainsHy(X)<br>
for Y= L0,R0 and X = L,R,C with six filters. These filters<br>
are derived from the ten filters Hr(X) for T = L0,i?oand<br>
X = Lf,LS,Rf, Rs, C, which describe the given HRTF filter<br>
responses in the QMF domain. These QMF representations can<br>
be achieved according to the method described in one of the<br>
subsequent paragraphs.<br>
In other words, the present invention teaches a concept for<br>
deriving modified HRTFs as by modifying (morphing) of the<br>
front end surround channel filters using a complex linear<br>
combination according to<br>
 <br>
As it can be seen from the above formula, deriving of the<br>
modified HRTFs is a weighted superposition of the original<br>
HRTFs, additionally applying phase factors. The weights ws,<br>
Wf depend on the CLD parameters intended to be used by the<br>
OTT decoders 124a and 124b of Fig. 5.<br>
 <br>
The weights wrf and wrs depend on the CLD parameter of the<br>
'OTT' box for Rf and Rs:<br>
The weights wlf and w1s depend on the CLD parameter of the<br>
'OTT'box for Lf and Ls:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The phase parameter xy can be derived from the main delay<br>
time difference txy between the front and back HRTF filters<br>
and the subband index nof the QMF bank:<br>
 <br>
The role of this phase parameter in the morphing of<br>
filters is twofold. First, it realizes a delay<br>
compensation of the two filters prior to superposition<br>
which leads to a combined response which models a main<br>
delay time corresponding to a source position between the<br>
front and the back speakers. Second, it makes the<br>
necessary gain compensation factor g much more stable and<br>
slowly varying over frequency than in the case of simple<br>
superposition with xy=0.<br>
The gain factor g is determined by the incoherent addition<br>
power rule,<br>
 <br>
and pxy is the real value of the normalized complex cross<br>
correlation between the filters<br>
 <br>
For the above equations, P denotes a parameter describing<br>
an average level per frequency band for the impulse<br>
response of the filter specified by the indexes. This mean<br>
intensity is of course easily derived, once the filter<br>
response function are known.<br>
 <br>
In the case of simple superposition with xy=0, the value<br>
of Pxy varies in an erratic and oscillatory manner as a<br>
function of frequency, which leads to the need for<br>
extensive gain adjustment. In practical implementation it<br>
is necessary to limit the value of the gaing and a<br>
remaining spectral colorization of the signal cannot be<br>
avoided.<br>
In contrast, the use of morphing with a delay based phase<br>
compensation as taught by the present invention leads to a<br>
smooth behaviour of pxy as a function of frequency. This<br>
value is often even close to one for natural HRTF derived<br>
filter pairs since they differ mainly in delay and<br>
amplitude, and the purpose of the phase parameter is to<br>
take the delay difference into account in the QMF<br>
filterbank domain.<br>
An alternative beneficial choice of phase parameter<br>
xy taught by the present invention is given by the phase<br>
angle of the normalized complex cross correlation between<br>
the filters<br>
 <br>
and unwrapping the phase values with standard unwrapping<br>
techniques as a function of the subband index n of the QMF<br>
bank. This choice has the consequence that pxy is never<br>
negative and hence the compensation gain gsatisfies<br>
1/2
parameter enables the morphing of the front and surround<br>
channel filters in situations where a main delay time<br>
difference txy is not available.<br>
For the embodiment of the present invention as described<br>
above/ it is taught to accurately transform the HRTFs into<br>
an efficient representation of the HRTF filters within the<br>
QMF domain.<br>
 <br>
Fig. 7 gives a principle sketch of the concept to<br>
accurately transform time-domain filters into filters<br>
within the subband domain having the same net effect on ,a<br>
reconstructed signal. Fig. 7 shows a complex analysis bank<br>
300, a synthesis bank 302 corresponding to the analysis<br>
bank 300, a filter converter 304 and a subband filter 306.<br>
An input signal 310 is provided for which a filter 312 is<br>
known having desired properties. The aim of the<br>
implementation of the filter converter 304 is that the<br>
output signal 314 has the same characteristics after<br>
analysis by the analysis filterbank 300, subsequent subband<br>
filtering 306 and synthesis 302 as if it would have when<br>
filtered by filter 312 in the time domain. The task of<br>
providing a number of subband filters corresponding to the<br>
number of subbands used is fulfilled by filter converter<br>
304.<br>
The following description outlines a method for<br>
implementing a given FIR filter A(v)in the complex QMF<br>
subband domain. The principle of operation is shown in<br>
Figure 7.<br>
Here, the subband filtering is simply the application of<br>
one complex valued FIR filter for each subband, n =0,1,.,.,L-1<br>
to transform the original indices cn into their filtered<br>
counterparts dn according to the following formula:<br>
 <br>
Observe that this is different from well known methods<br>
developed for critically sampled filterbanks, since those<br>
methods require multiband filtering with longer responses.<br>
The key component is the filter converter, which converts<br>
any time domain FIR filter into the complex subband domain<br>
filters. Since the complex QMF subband domain is<br>
oversampled, there is no canonical set of subband filters<br>
 <br>
for a given time domain filter. Different subband filters<br>
can have the same net effect of the time domain signal.<br>
What will be described here is a particularly attractive<br>
approximate solution, which is obtained by restricting the<br>
filter converter to be a complex analysis bank similar to<br>
the QMF.<br>
Assuming that the filter converter prototype is of length<br>
64Kq, a real 64KH tap FIR filter is transformed into a set<br>
of 64 complex KH+KQ-l tap subband filters. ForKQ=3, a<br>
FIR filter of 1024 taps is converted into 18 tap subband<br>
filtering with an approximation quality of 50 dB.<br>
The subband filter taps are computed from the; formula<br>
 <br>
where q(V) is a FIR prototype filter derived from the QMF<br>
prototype filter- As it can be seen, this is just a complex<br>
filterbank analysis of the given filterh(V)•<br>
In the following, the inventive concept will be outlined<br>
for a further embodiment of the present invention, where a<br>
multi-channel parametric representation for a multi-channel<br>
signal having five channels is available. Please note that<br>
in this particular embodiment of the present invention,<br>
original 10 HRTF filters VY,X (as for example given by a QMF<br>
representation of the filters 12a to 12j of Fig 1) are<br>
morphed into six filters hV/X for Y = L, R and X = L,R,C<br>
The ten filters vyx for Y=L,R and X = FL,BL,FR,BR,C<br>
describe the given HRTF filter responses in a hybrid QMF<br>
domain -<br>
the combination of the front and surround channel filters<br>
is performed with a complex linear combination according to<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
equal to n forA: = 0,1	 In cases where there are two<br>
choices, ±n , for the increment, the sign of the increment<br>
for a phase measurement in the interval ]-,]is chosen.<br>
Finally, normalized phase compensated cross correlations<br>
are defined for Y=LJEt and X=L,R by<br>
 <br>
Please note that in the case where the multi-channel<br>
processing is performed within a hybrid subband domain,<br>
i.e. in a domain where subbands are further decomposed<br>
into different frequency bands, a mapping of the HRTF<br>
responses to the hybrid band filters may for example be<br>
performed as follows:<br>
As in the case without an hybrid filterbank, the ten given<br>
HRTF impulse responses from source X = FL,BL,FR,BR,C to<br>
target Y = L,R are all converted into QMF subband filters<br>
according to the method outlined above. The result is the<br>
ten subband filters vyx with components<br>
 <br>
for QMF subband m=0,l,...,63and QMF time slot / = 0,1,...,Lq-1. Let<br>
the index mapping from the hybrid band it to QMF band mbe<br>
denoted by m=Q(k) .<br>
Then the HRTF filters vyxin the hybrid band domain are<br>
defined by<br>
 <br>
For the specific embodiment described in the previous<br>
paragraphs, the filter conversion of HRTF filters into the<br>
QMF domain can be implemented as follows, given a FIR<br>
filter h(y) of length Nh to be transferred to the complex<br>
QMF subband domain:<br>
 <br>
The subband filtering consists of the separate application<br>
of one complex valued FIR filter hm(l) for each QMF subband,<br>
m' = 0,V..,63 • The key component is the filter converter, which<br>
converts the given time domain FIR filter h(v)±nto the<br>
complex subband domain filters hm(l). The filter converter<br>
is a complex analysis bank similar to the QMF analysis<br>
bank. Its prototype filter q(v) is of length 192. An<br>
extension with zeros of the time domain FIR filter is<br>
defined by<br>
 <br>
Although the inventive concept has been detailed with<br>
respect to a down mix signal having two channels, i.e. a<br>
transmitted stereo signal, the application of the inventive<br>
concept is by no means restricted to a scenario having a<br>
stereo-down mix signal.<br>
Summarizing, the present invention relates to the problem<br>
of using long HRTF or crosstalk cancellation filters for<br>
binaural rendering of parametric multi-channel signals. The<br>
invention teaches new ways to extend the parametric HRTF<br>
approach to arbitrary length of HRTF filters.<br>
The present invention comprises the following features:<br>
Multiplying the stereo down mix signal by a 2 by 2<br>
matrix where every matrix element is a FIR filter or<br>
arbitrary length (as given by the HRTF filter);<br>
 <br>
Deriving the filters in the 2 by 2 matrix by morphing<br>
the original HRTF filters based on the transmitted<br>
multi-channel parameters;<br>
- Calculation of the morphing of the HRTF filters so<br>
that the correct spectral envelope and overall energy<br>
is obtained.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example for an inventive decoder 300 for<br>
deriving a headphone down mix signal. The decoder comprises<br>
a filter calculator 302 and a synthesizer 304. The filter<br>
calculator receives as a first input level parameters 306<br>
and as a second input HRTFs (head-related transfer<br>
functions) 308 to derive modified HRTFs 310 that have the<br>
same net effect on a signal when applied to the signal in<br>
the subband domain than the head-related transfer functions<br>
308 applied in the time domain. The modified HRTFs 310<br>
serve as first input to the synthesizer 304 that receives<br>
as a second input a representation of a down-mix signal 312<br>
within a subband domain. The representation of the down-mix<br>
signal 312 is derived by a parametric multi-channel encoder<br>
and intended to be used as a basis for reconstruction of a<br>
full multi-channel signal by a multi-channel decoder. The<br>
synthesizer 404 is thus able to derive a headphone down-mix<br>
signal 314 using the modified HRTFs 310 and the<br>
representation of the down-mix signal 312.<br>
It may be noted, that the HRTFs could be provided in any<br>
possible parametric representation, for example as the<br>
transfer function associated to the filter, as the impulse<br>
response of the filter or as a series of tap coefficients<br>
for an FIR-filter.<br>
The previous examples assume, that the representation of<br>
the down-mix signal is already supplied as a filterbank<br>
representation, i.e. as samples derived by a filterbank. In<br>
practical applications, however, a time-domain down-mix<br>
signal is typically supplied and transmitted to allow also<br>
 <br>
for a direct playback of the submitted signal in simple<br>
playback environments. Therefore, in Fig. 9 in a further<br>
embodiment of the present invention, where a binaural<br>
compatible decoder 400 comprises an analysis filterbank 402<br>
and a synthesis filterbank 404 and an inventive decoder,<br>
which could, for example, be the decoder 300 of Fig. 8.<br>
Decoder functionalities and their descriptions are<br>
applicable in Fig. 9 as well as in Fig. 8 and the<br>
description of the decoder 300 will be omitted within the<br>
following paragraph.<br>
The analysis filterbank 402 receives a downmix of a multi-<br>
channel signal 406 as created by a multi-channel parametric<br>
encoder. The analysis filterbank 402 derives the filterbank<br>
representation of the received down mix signal 406 which is<br>
then input into decoder 300 that derives a headphone<br>
downmix signal 408, still within the filterbank domain.<br>
That is, the down mix is represented by a multitude of<br>
samples or coefficients within the frequency bands<br>
introduced by the analysis filterbank 402. Therefore, to<br>
provide a final headphone down mix signal 410 in the time<br>
domain the headphone downmix signal 408 is input into<br>
synthesis filterbank 404 that derives the headphone down<br>
mix signal 410, which is ready to be played back by stereo<br>
reproduction equipment.<br>
Fig. 10 shows an inventive receiver or audio player 500,<br>
having an inventive audio decoder 501, a bit stream<br>
input 502, and an audio output 504.<br>
A bit stream can be input at the input 502 of the inventive<br>
receiver/audio player 500. The bit stream then is decoded<br>
by the decoder 501 and the decoded signal is output or<br>
played at the output 504 of the inventive receiver/audio<br>
player 500.<br>
Although examples have been derived in the preceding<br>
paragraphs to implement the inventive concept relying on a<br>
 <br>
transmitted stereo down mix, the inventive concept may also<br>
be applied in configurations based on a single monophonic<br>
down mix channel or on more than two down mix channels.<br>
One particular implementation of the transfer of head-<br>
related transfer functions into the subband domain is given<br>
in the description of the present invention. However, other<br>
techniques of deriving the subband filters may also be used<br>
without limiting the inventive concept.<br>
The phase factors introduced in the derivation of the<br>
modified HRTFs can be derived also by other computations<br>
than the ones previously presented. Therefore, deriving<br>
those factors in a different way does not limit the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
Even as the inventive concept is shown particularly for<br>
HRTF and crosstalk cancellation filters, it can be used for<br>
other filters defined for one or more individual channels<br>
of a multi channel signal to allow for a computationally<br>
efficient generation of a high quality stereo playback<br>
signal. The filters are furthermore not only restricted to<br>
filters intended to model a listening environment. Even<br>
filters adding "artificial" components to a signal can be<br>
used, such as for example reverberation or other distortion<br>
filters.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be<br>
performed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disk, DVD or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system such that the inventive methods are<br>
performed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore,<br>
a computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer<br>
 <br>
program product runs on a computer. In other words, the<br>
inventive methods are, therefore, a computer program having<br>
a program code for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and<br>
described with reference to particular embodiments thereof,<br>
it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various other changes in the form and details may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. It is<br>
to be understood that various changes may be made in<br>

 <br>
A headphone down mix signal (314) can be efficiently derived from a parametric down mix of a multi-channel signal (312), when modified HRTFs (310) (head related transfer functions) are derived from HRTFs (308) of a multi-channel signal using a level parameter (306) having<br>
information on a level relation between two channels of the multi-channel signals such that a modified HRTF (310) is stronger influenced by the HRTF (308) of a channel having a higher level than by the HRTF (308) of a channel having a lower level. Modified HRTFs (310) are derived within the decoding process taking into account the relative strength of the channels associated to the HRTFs (308). The HRTFs (308) are thus modified such that a down mix signal (314)<br>
of a parametric representation of a multi-channel signal can directly be used to synthesize the headphone down mix signal (314) without the need of an intermediate full<br>
parametric multi-channel reconstruction of the parametric down mix.</td>
