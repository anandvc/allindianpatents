				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND METHOD FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optical recording medium<br>
having a dye recording layer, and a manufacturing method for the<br>
same.<br>
Background Art<br>
In addition to such optical recording media as Compact Disc<br>
Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM), recordable CDs (CD-Rs and CD-<br>
RWs) are now commercialized and widely used.<br>
In contrast to conventional CDs, CD-Rs and CD-RWs feature<br>
that the user can write to them and signals generated following<br>
recording are designed to meet the conventional CD standards so<br>
that they can be played on CD players available on the market.<br>
As a method of achieving fabrication of such recording media,<br>
for example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a method of<br>
manufacturing a CD-R disc by applying a dye over a substrate by<br>
spin coating to form a light-absorbing layer and providing a metallic<br>
reflective layer on the light-absorbing layer.<br>
Dye-based materials are used as the materials of the light-<br>
absorbing layer.<br><br>
One feature of CD-R is its high reflectance (65%), which meets<br>
the CD standards. For the purpose of obtaining high reflectance<br>
with the foregoing disc configuration, the light-absorbing layer<br>
needs to have a specific complex refractive index over a wavelength<br>
range of the laser beam source for recording and reproduction, and<br>
utilization of dye's light absorption property is suitable for<br>
achieving this.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, however, there is a problem that the<br>
complex refractive index is greatly dependent on the wavelength<br>
because it utilizes the feature of the absorption band end in the<br>
light absorption spectrum of the dye film.<br>
As next-generation recording media, DVD-R and DVD+R are<br>
commercialized that are capable of high-density recording and/or<br>
reproduction by using a laser beam with a wavelength of around<br>
650nm rather than using a conventional laser beam with a<br>
wavelength of around 780nm designed for CD. The performance of<br>
recording material containing the foregoing dye for CD-R (e.g.,<br>
pentamethine cyanine dyes or phthalocyanine dyes) is largely<br>
dependent on the wavelength of the laser beam; therefore, it results<br>
in failure to satisfy recording/reproduction characteristics at 650nm.<br>
This is due to a large absorption coefficient (k) at 650nm and low<br>
reflectance, which makes information recording/reproduction<br>
difficult.<br>
To overcome this problem, organic dyes such as trimethine<br><br>
cyanine dyes, azo dyes and tetra-azaporhirazine are proposed as<br>
materials for recoding layer which adjust the range of the<br>
absorption wavelength of dyes or recording materials. These dyes<br>
are disclosed for instance in Patent Literatures 2, 3, 4, and 5.<br>
Along with a recent increase in the recording velocity for<br>
recordable DVD discs, improvements are made also on recording<br>
materials; examples are squaric acid complexes and trimethine<br>
cyanine dye materials, which are disclosed for instance in Patent<br>
Literatures 6, 7, and 8.<br>
Even with these recording materials, however, it is difficult to<br>
achieve high-speed recording characteristics and archivability<br>
(durability) at the same time. The reason for this is that although<br>
recording materials that exhibit low thermal decomposition<br>
temperatures and high decomposition rates are preferred, these<br>
materials are likely to cause a reduction in heat resistance and wet<br>
resistance. Generally, two or more dye materials are mixed to avoid<br>
this, which however leads to the problem described below.<br>
While a dye recording film is deposited by application of its<br>
coating solution by spin coating, the coating solution being obtained<br>
by dissolving a dye in solvent, the combined use of two or more<br>
different recording materials — for example, a coating solution<br>
containing a cyanine dye with ionic structure and a squalene<br>
compound with chelate structure — is more likely to cause<br>
interactions such as exchange reactions in the mixture, resulting in<br><br>
failure to obtain desired characteristics due to chemical changes.<br>
In particular, the PF6- ion, an anion in the cyanine dye, is so<br>
reactive that it tends to cause dechelation of squaric acid complex,<br>
for example.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the foregoing<br>
problems and to provide an optical recording medium having a dye<br>
recording layer, which the medium is excellent in recording<br>
characteristics, durability, and productivity, and a method of<br>
manufacturing the optical recording medium.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the findings by the present<br>
inventors, and means of solving the foregoing problems are as<br>
follows:<br> An optical recording medium including: a substrate<br>
having at least one of grooves and pits on a surface thereof; and a<br>
dye recording layer formed over the substrate, wherein the dye<br>
recording layer comprises a cyanine dye represented by the<br>
following General Formula (I), a squaric acid complex represented<br>
by the following General Formula (II), and an amine compound:<br>
General Formula (I)<br><br>
wherein R,1 and R2 independently represent an alkyl group which<br>
may be substituted, an aryl group which may be substituted, or a<br>
benzyl group which may be substituted, Z represents an atom group<br>
for forming an aromatic ring, X represents a monovalent anion, and<br>
L represents a linking group for forming a carbocyanine,<br>
General Formula (II)<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, are an alkyl<br>
group which may be substituted, an aralkyl group which may be<br>
substituted, an aryl group which may be substituted, or a<br>
heterocyclic ring which may be substituted, Q represents a metal<br>
atom which has a coordinating property, q represents an integer of 2<br>
or 3, and A represents an aryl group which may be substituted, a<br>
heterocyclic ring which may be substituted, or Y=CH- (where Y<br>
represents an aryl group which may be substituted or a heterocyclic<br>
ring which may be substituted).<br>
Since the recording layer contains at least the foregoing<br>
cyanine dye, squaric acid complex and amine compound, it is<br>
possible to prevent interaction of dye with other ingredients upon<br>
mixed and thus to provide an optical recording medium with a dye<br>
layer, which is excellent in recording characteristics, durability, and<br>
productivity.<br> The optical recording medium according to , wherein<br>
the cyanine dye in the recording layer has PF6 as an anion. By<br>
using PF6 as the anion of the cyanine dye of the dye recording<br><br>
medium, it is possible to provide an optical recording medium which<br>
is excellent in high-speed recording performance.<br> The optical recording medium according to , wherein<br>
the content of the amine compound in the recording layer is 10% by<br>
mass or less.<br>
If the content of the amine compound in the dye recording<br>
layer is 10% or less, it is possible to ensure stability upon dye<br>
mixing without causing a reduction in recording characteristics.<br> The optical recording medium according to one of <br>
and , wherein the amine compound is a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic compound.<br>
When the amine compound is a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic compound, the thermal decomposition temperature of<br>
the dye recording layer increases and it is possible to provide an<br>
optical recording medium with excellent heat resistance.<br> A method for manufacturing an optical recording<br>
medium, including: applying over a surface of a substrate a solvent<br>
in which at least a cyanine dye represented by the following General<br>
Formula (I), a squaric acid complex represented by the following<br>
General Formula (II), and an amine compound are dissolved, to<br>
thereby form a dye recording layer over the substrate, wherein the<br>
optical recording medium comprises the substrate having at least<br>
one of grooves and pits on a surface thereof, and the dye recording<br>
layer formed over the substrate:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 independently represent an alkyl group which<br>
may be substituted, an aryl group which may be substituted, or a<br>
benzyl group which may be substituted, Z represents an atom group<br>
for forming an aromatic ring, X represents a monovalent anion, and<br>
L represents a linking group for forming a carbocyanine,<br>
General Formula (II)<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, are an alkyl<br>
group which may be substituted, an aralkyl group which may be<br>
substituted, an aryl group which may be substituted, or a<br>
heterocyclic ring which may be substituted, Q represents a metal<br>
atom which has a coordinating property, q represents an integer of 2<br><br>
or 3, and A represents an aryl group which may be substituted, a<br>
heterocyclic ring which may be substituted, or Y=CH (where Y<br>
represents an aryl group which may be substituted or a heterocyclic<br>
ring which may be substituted).<br>
With this method of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
prevent interaction of dye with other ingredients upon mixed. Thus,<br>
the method of the present invention provides excellent productivity.<br> The method for manufacturing an optical recording<br>
medium according to , wherein the amine compound is a liquid<br>
tertiary amine.<br>
The use of a liquid tertiary amine in the method of the<br>
present invention results in a high effect of preventing interactions<br>
of dye with other ingredients when mixed. In addition, since the<br>
amine compound is a liquid, the amine compound is not contained in<br>
the resultant recording layer and hence it is possible to bring about<br>
the effect of the present invention.<br> The method for manufacturing an optical recording<br>
medium according to one of  and , wherein the solvent is a<br>
fluorine-substituted alcohol.<br>
Fluorine-substituted alcohols have high solubility, providing<br>
excellent productivity when used in the preparation of a coating<br>
solution for a recording layer in the method of the present invention.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
(Operation)<br>
FIG. 2 shows an example of a layer configuration of a DVD+R<br>
or DVD-R disc.<br>
In this drawing, reference numeral 1 denotes a substrate; 2 a<br>
recording layer made of dye; 3, a reflective layer; 4, a protective<br>
layer; 5, an adhesive layer; 6, a cover substrate; and 7, a groove.<br>
Information is recorded on or reproduced from the disc by<br>
irradiation with laser beam light from the substrate 1 side. The<br>
substrate 1 has a groove formed over the surface.<br>
One of the features of such recording media as DVD+R and<br>
CD-R that can be played on CD players is that the track information<br>
is embedded in the form of wobbling grooves or pits.<br>
The degree of wobbling can be detected as a wobble signal<br>
from a track signal. Track information is previously recorded in the<br>
substrate by modulating a given frequency by FM modulation or<br>
phase modulation.<br>
The track information includes address information and disc<br><br>
rotation frequency information. When the wobble signal is to be<br>
detected from the track signal, it is easy to distinguish the wobble<br>
signal from information data signals and to obtain ROM signal<br>
compatibility.<br>
The present invention relates to the dye recording layer<br>
materials described above. The optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention is an optical recording medium having at least a<br>
dye recording layer over a substrate which has at least one of<br>
grooves and pits formed on a surface thereof, wherein the recording<br>
layer comprises at least a cyanine dye represented by the foregoing<br>
General Formula (I), a squaric acid complex represented by the<br>
foregoing General Formula (II), and an amine compound.<br>
Cyanine dyes represented by General Formula (I) and squaric<br>
acid complexes represented by General Formula (II) have excellent<br>
performance as recording materials for DVD.<br>
In particular, among cyanine dyes represented by General<br>
Formula (I), those represented by the following Formula (3) with<br>
various combinations of substituents listed in Table 1, which have<br>
PFG" as an anion, are generally used because their thermal<br>
decomposition property is suitable for high-speed recording.<br>
However, ions such as PF6 causes an increase in acidity of<br>
coating solution when mixed with a squaric acid complex, thereby<br>
dechelating the squaric acid complex.<br>
Formula (3)<br><br><br>
In Table 1 "Ph" denotes a phenyl group, "CH3" denotes a<br>
methyl group, "Cl" denotes a chlorine atom, "i-Pr" denotes an<br>
isopropyl group, "Cyclohexyl" denotes a six-member ring formed of<br>
R3 and R4 combined together, and "Naphthyl" denotes a naphthyl<br>
group formed together with a benzene ring.<br>
Specific examples of squaric acid complexes represented by<br>
For example, the No.l cyanine in Table 1 has a structure<br>
represented by the Formula (4) below.<br>
Formula (4)<br><br><br>
General Formula (II) are compounds represented by the following<br>
Formula (5) with various combinations of substituents listed in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Formula (5)<br><br><br><br>
In Table 2 "Ph" denotes a phenyl group, "CF3" denotes a<br>
trifluoromethyl group, "CH3" denotes a methyl group, "t-Bu" denotes<br>
a tertiary butyl group, "i-Pr" denotes an isopropyl group,<br>
"Cyclohexyl" denotes a six-member ring formed of R3 and R4<br>
combined together, and "Naphthyl" denotes a naphthyl group<br>
formed together with a benzene ring.<br>
For example, the No.l and No.2 squaric acid complexes have<br>
the structures represented by the Formulae (6) and (7), respectively.<br>
The position of substituent R6 in the No.3 and No.7 compounds is<br>
the same as in the Formula (7).<br>
Formula (6)<br><br><br><br>
To avoid dechelation, in the present invention, an amine<br>
compound is added as a stabilizer.<br>
Amine compounds are basic compounds which prevent<br>
oxidation (dechelation).<br>
Meanwhile, general solvents used for the preparation of<br>
coating solution are fluorine-substituted alcohols such as 2,2,3,3-<br>
tetrafluoropropanol, in light of their high solubility for the foregoing<br>
dyes.<br>
The acidity, water content, etc., of the solvent also influence<br>
the amine's stabilizing capability. It is, however, difficult to control<br>
these parameters and it results in high manufacturing costs. When<br>
an amine compound is a solid, it is contained in the recording layer<br>
by means of spin coating. For this reason, the content of amine<br>
compound is preferably not greater than 10% by mass of dye; a too<br>
high content influences the optical characteristics and<br>
thermophysical properties of the recording layer, increasing the<br><br>
likelihood of jitter increase in the recording signals.<br>
Whereas a too low amine compound content makes it difficult<br>
to obtain the stabilizing effect. A particularly preferred amine<br>
compound content range with respect to dye is 0.5% by mass to 3%<br>
by mass.<br>
In addition, amine compounds having a nitrogen-containing<br>
heterocyclic ring are preferable. Furthermore, amine compounds<br>
with a melting point of 150°C or higher are preferable. The reason<br>
for this is that those with a melting point of less than 150°C are<br>
more likely to cause changes in characteristics (particularly optical<br>
characteristics) of the light-absorbing layer when placed under high<br>
temperature, high humidity conditions. Among those amine<br>
compounds, imidazole, benzimidazole, and thiazole derivatives are<br>
most preferable.<br>
When the amine compound is a liquid present in a small<br>
amount, the amine compound can be removed from the recording<br>
layer either during the spin coating process or following heating<br>
process.<br>
Thus, the content of the liquid amine compound in coating<br>
solution is preferably not greater than 10% by mass as has been<br>
described above, because a content of 10% or more makes it difficult<br>
to remove the amine compound.<br>
There is no need to allow any amine compound to exist in the<br>
resulting recording layer.<br><br>
Tertiary amines (e.g., triethylamine and tripropylamine) are<br>
preferably employed in the case of a liquid amine compound,<br>
because this increases basicity of the coating solution and amine's<br>
stabilizing capability.<br>
A dye recording layer provided for example in a DVD+R disc<br>
is generally produced by spin coating, a method that involves<br>
dropwise application of coating solution onto a rotating substrate,<br>
followed by removal or drying of solvent by further increasing the<br>
rotational speed of the substrate. This method, however, can utilize<br>
as small as 10% to 20% of the coating solution for film deposition<br>
onto the substrate, and the rest of the coating solution remains in<br>
the spin coating tank. Re-use of the tank content refers to as a "dye<br>
recycle," wherein the tank content (liquid and solids) is again<br>
dissolved in coating solvent to prepare a coating solution.<br>
By allowing an amine compound to be present in the dye film,<br>
it can also realize recycling of dyes while ensuring the stability of<br>
coating solution.<br>
Specific examples of amine compounds include n-butylamine,<br>
n-hexylamine, tert-butylamine, pyrrole, pyrrolidine, pyridine,<br>
piperidine, purin, imidazole, benzimidazole, 5,6-<br>
dimethylbenzimidazole, 2,5,6-trimethylbenzimidazole,<br>
naphthoimidazole, 2-methylnaphthoimidazole, quinoline,<br>
isoquinoline, quinoxaline, benzoquinoline, phenanthridine, indoline,<br>
carbazole, norharman, thiazole, benzothiazole, benzoxazole,<br><br>
benzotriazole, 7-azaindole, tetrahydr'oquinoline, triphenylimidazole,<br>
phthalimide, benzoisoquinoline-5,10-dion, triazine, perimidine, 5-<br>
chlorotriazole, ethylenediamine, azobenzene, trimethylamine,<br>
triethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, l(2H)-phthalazinone,<br>
phthalhydrazide, 1,3-diiminoisoindoline, oxazole, polyimidazole,<br>
polybenzimidazole, and polythiazole.<br>
Conventional cyanine dyes can be employed without any<br>
modification, examples of which are those disclosed in JP-B Nos.<br>
2594443, 3698708, and 3659922.<br>
In particular, as described above, compounds that have PF6<br>
as an anion are suitable for high-speed, high-density recording<br>
because they produce small amount of heat when thermally<br>
decomposed.<br>
Conventional squaric acid complexes can be employed, as can<br>
the cyanine dyes, and examples of such squaric acid complexes are<br>
those disclosed in International Publication No. 2002/050190 and<br>
JP-A No. 2004-244342.<br>
(Layer Configuration)<br>
Hereinafter, materials of other layers provided in the optical<br>
recording medium of the present invention will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
Materials of the substrate used in the present invention can<br>
be selected from any materials for use in substrates for conventional<br>
recording media; examples include acrylic resins such as<br><br>
polymethylmethacrylate, vinyl chloride resins such as polyvinyl<br>
chloride and polyvinyl chloride copolymers, epoxy resins,<br>
polycarbonate resins, amorphous polyolefins, polyesters, glass such<br>
as soda-lime glass, and ceramics.<br>
Among these, polymetylmethacrylate, polycarbonate resins,<br>
epoxy resins, amorphous polyolefins, polyesters, and glass are<br>
preferable in view of their shape stability, transparency, and the<br>
ease with which they can be flattened.<br>
Furthermore, polycarbonate resins are more preferable in<br>
view of their moldability.<br>
A surface of the substrate over which an optical recording<br>
layer is to be deposited may be provided with an undercoat layer for<br>
the purpose of improving flatness, enhancing adhesive property, and<br>
preventing degradation of the optical recording film.<br>
Examples of materials of the undercoat layer include<br>
polymers such as polymethylmethacrylate, acrylic acid/methacrylic<br>
acid copolymers, styrene/ maleic acid anhydride copolymers,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, N-methylolacrylamide, styrene/vinyl sulfonic acid<br>
copolymers, styrene/vinyl toluene copolymers, chlorosulfonated<br>
polyethylene, nitrocellulose, polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated<br>
polyolefins, polyesters, polyimides, vinyl acetate/vinyl chloride<br>
copolymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers, polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, and polycarbonates; organic materials such as silane<br>
coupling agents; inorganic oxides such as SiO2 and AI2O3; and<br><br>
inorganic materials such as inorganic fluorides such as MgF2. Note<br>
that the undercoat layer generally ranges from 0.005μm to 20μm in<br>
thickness, preferably from 0.01μm. to 10μm.<br>
A pre-groove layer may be formed over the substrate or<br>
undercoat layer for the purpose of forming a tracking groove or a<br>
pattern of concaves and convexes that represents information such<br>
as address signal.<br>
Examples of available materials of the pre-groove layer<br>
include a mixture of a photoinitiator and at least one monomer (or<br>
oligomer) selected from a monoester, diester, triester, and tetraester<br>
of acrylic acid.<br>
Moreover, a reflective layer is provided over the optical<br>
recording layer for the purpose of increasing the S/N ratio,<br>
reflectance, and sensitivity upon recording. Light reflective<br>
materials used for manufacture of the reflective layer are materials<br>
that reflect laser beam light to a great extent; examples include<br>
metals and semi-metals such as M.g, Se, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr,<br>

The method of the present invention for manufacturing an<br>
optimal recording medium will be described below. In the method of<br><br>
the present invention for manufacturing an optical recording<br>
medium with, a DVD-R disc configuration is characterized in that (l)<br>
an optical recording layer containing the dye compounds (I) and (II)<br>
and amine compound as main ingredients is provided on a surface of<br>
a substrate by coating means either directly or with a layer<br>
interposed between them, the surface having at least one of grooves<br>
and pits thereon, (2) a reflective layer is provided over the optical<br>
recording layer by means of vacuum deposition either directly or<br>
with a layer is interposed between them, and (3) a protective layer<br>
is provided over the optical recording layer.<br>
That is, the method according to the present invention for<br>
manufacturing an optical recording medium comprises (l) providing<br>
an optical recording layer containing the dye compounds (I) and (II)<br>
and amine compound as main ingredients on a surface of a<br>
substrate by coating means either directly or with a layer<br>
interposed between them, the surface having at least one of grooves<br>
and pits thereon,' (2) providing a reflective layer over the optical<br>
recording layer by means of vacuum deposition either directly or<br>
with a layer interposed between them; and (3) providing a protective<br>
layer over the optical recording layer.<br>
(Optical Recording Layer Formation Step)<br>
In the first step of the method of the present invention, an<br>
optical recording layer containing the dye compounds (I) and (II)<br>
and amine compound as main ingredients is provided on a surface of<br><br>
a substrate by coating means either directly or with a layer<br>
interposed between them, the surface having at least one of grooves<br>
and pits thereon. To be more specific, the dye compounds (I) and<br>
(II) and amine compound are dissolved into a solvent to produce a<br>
coating solution, which is then applied over the substrate to form<br>
the optical recording layer.<br>
Solvents that can be used for the preparation this coating<br>
solution are known organic solvents such as alcohols, cellosolves,<br>
halogenated carbons, ketones, and ethers.<br>
Moreover, spin coating is a preferable coating method<br>
because it is possible to control the layer thickness by adjusting the<br>
concentration and viscosity of the optical recording layer and the<br>
drying temperature of the solvent.<br>
A surface of the substrate over which the optical recording<br>
layer is to be deposited is provided with an undercoat layer for the<br>
purpose of improving flatness, enhancing adhesive property, and<br>
preventing degradation of the optical recording film.<br>
This undercoat layer can be formed by dissolving or<br>
dispersing any of the foregoing materials for undercoat layer into an<br>
suitable solvent and by applying the resultant coating solution over<br>
the substrate by technique such as spin coating, dip coating, or<br>
extrusion coating.<br>
(Optical Reflective Layer Formation Step)<br>
In the second step of the method of the present invention, a<br><br>
reflective layer is provided over the optical recording layer by<br>
vacuum deposition either directly or with a layer interposed<br>
between them. To be more specific, the reflective layer is deposited<br>
over the optical recording layer by vapor deposition, sputtering, or<br>
ion plating of any of the foregoing light reflective materials.<br>
(Protective Layer Formation Step)<br>
In the third step in the method of the present invention, a<br>
protective layer is provided over the reflective layer. To be more<br>
specific, the protective layer can be formed by vacuum deposition or<br>
application of any of the foregoing materials for protective layer,<br>
including inorganic materials and various types of resins; It is<br>
particularly preferable to adopt UV-curable resin; the protective<br>
layer is formed by applying UV-curable resin by spin coating<br>
followed by application of UV to cure the resin.<br>
Example<br>
The present invention will be described with reference to<br>
Examples and Comparative Example, which however shall not be<br>
construed as limiting the invention thereto.<br>
(Example l)<br>
A substrate with a pattern of grooves (depth = approximately<br>
l,600A, width = approximately 0.24μm, track pitch = 0.74μm)<br>
formed on a polycarbonate disc (diameter = 120mm, thickness =<br>
0.6mm) was prepared. Subsequently, the No.l dye in Table 1<br><br>
(Cyanine Dye (I)), the No.2 dye in Table 2 (Squaric Acid Complex<br>
(II)), and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (Amine Compound) were mixed<br>
together in 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropanol to produce a coating solution<br>
for dye recording layer.<br>
The dye compounds were dissolved in the solvent by stirring<br>
at 60°C for 5hr, and the obtained coating solution was applied by<br>
spin coating and annealed at 90°C for 15min to form a dye recording<br>
layer of about 800A thickness.<br>
The dye concentration was set to 1.0%, and the Dye (l):Dye<br>
(2): Amine Compound ratio was set to 60:39:1 (by mass). The<br>
optical absorption spectrum of the coating solution is shown in FIG.<br>
3.<br>
A reflective layer was then deposited on the recording layer by<br>
sputtering of a Ag alloy (Ag/IN .= 99.5/0.5) to a thickness of l,400A<br>
using Ar gas as sputtering gas.<br>
A protective layer made of UV-curable resin was formed on<br>
the reflective layer to a thickness of about 4μm to fabricate a disc-<br>
shaped article, which was then bonded to a polycarbonate cover<br>
substrate of similar shape with a UV-curable resin adhesive. In<br>
this way a DVD+R disc was manufactured.<br>
The recording medium was evaluated using disc evaluation<br>
equipment (ODU-1000 and DDU-1000 by PulseTec) under the<br>
evaluation conditions described below.<br>
(Signal Recording)<br><br>
DVD(8-16) signals were recorded under the following<br>
condition: laser wavelength = 659nm, lens NA = 0.65, recording<br>
linear velocity = 16x (55.8 m/s). A write strategy based on the<br>
DVD+R standards was adopted.<br>
(Signal Recording)<br>
The disc was played on a DVD-ROM player (lens NA = 0.60,<br>
laser wavelength = 650nm) at Ix (3.5 m/s), measuring the jitter of<br>
pit edge-clock (σ/T) by Time Interval Analyzer. In addition,<br>
reflectance to reflection signals was measured. It succeeded in<br>
obtaining such excellent signal characteristics that σ/T was 7.2%<br>
and reflectance was 48%.<br>
(Comparative Example l)<br>
An optical recording medium was manufactured as in<br>
Example 1 except that no amine compound was added, and a similar<br>
signal evaluation was made. The optical absorption spectrum of the<br>
dye coating solution prepared upon manufacture of this optical<br>
recording medium is shown in FIG. 3, which is different from that of<br>
the dye coating solution prepared in Example 1.<br>
The result of the signal evaluation was as follows: σ/T was<br>
9.5% and reflectance was 41%. This means that signal<br>
characteristics of Comparative Example 1 was poor compared to<br>
Example 1 (i.e., σ/T increased and reflectance decreased), resulting<br>
in failure to meet the DVD+R standards.<br>
(Example 2)<br><br>
Preparation of dye coating solution was conducted as in<br>
Example 1 except that dye coating solutions containing different<br>
amounts of amine compound (0.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 wt%) were<br>
prepared, and their optical absorption spectra were measured. It<br>
turned out that the absorption spectra were similar to that obtained<br>
in Example 1.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
A dye coating solution was prepared as in Example 1 except<br>
that the amine compound was changed from 5,6-<br>
dimethylbenzimidazole to triethylamine, and the optical absorption<br>
spectrum was measured. As shown in FIG. 3, it turned out that the<br>
optical absorption spectrum was similar to that obtained in<br>
Example 1. Also, it succeeded in obtaining such excellent signal<br>
characteristics that σ/T was 7.5% and reflectance was 48%.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
A DVD+R disc was manufactured as in Example 1 except that<br>
the amine compound was changed from 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolo<br>
to triethylamine, and the absorption spectrum was measured. It<br>
succeeded in obtaining such excellent signal characteristics that σ/T<br>
was 7.5% and reflectance was 48%.<br>
(Examples 5 to 10)<br>
DVD+R media were manufactured as in Example 4 except<br>
that compounds and their ratios listed in Examples 5 to 10 of Table<br>
3 were adopted, and then signal evaluations were made.<br><br>
The evaluation results shown in Table 3 indicate that all of<br>
the DVD discs prepared in Examples 5 to 10 offered excellent signal<br>
characteristics.<br>
Note in Table 3 that the cyanine dye number "No."<br>
corresponds to the dye number of Table 1, the squaric acid complex<br>
number "No." corresponds to the dye number of Table 2, "DMBi"<br>
stands for 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, "Bi" stands for benzimidazole,<br>
and "TEA" stands for tetraethylamine.<br><br>
A DVD+R disc was manufactured as in Example 1 except that<br>
the anion of the cyanine dye was changed to C104", and then a signal<br>
evaluation was made. The evaluation result shown in Table 3<br>
indicates that it succeeded in obtaining excellent signal<br>
characteristics.<br><br>
