				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to improvements in and relating to devices and apparatus for testing<br>
metal components, and methods and systems associated therewith. More particularly, but not<br>
exclusively, this invention relates to methods of testing the integrity of railway lines.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Metal components suffer from a degree of residual stress caused by actions such as mechanical<br>
or thermal loading. The presence of stress affects the physical properties of a metal component<br>
and can result in stress fatigue and even failure of a component.<br>
Methods available for measuring residual stress in metal components are not in widespread<br>
usage. Current practice is generally simply to subject a metal component to thermal stress<br>
relieving techniques regardless of the actual need. Therefore a significant wastage of<br>
resources arises in heat treating metal components not requiring stress relief.<br>
A related problem arises with elongate components such as railway lines and pipelines. A<br>
railway track is generally laid in such a way as to be under a neutral load condition at a<br>
predetermined temperature. When the track is above the neutral temperature the railway line<br>
as a whole is placed under compression as the sections expand. At excessive levels this can<br>
result in the track buckling. At temperatures lower than the neutral temperature the track<br>
lengths exist in tension. At some point if the tensile forces are high enough, ie the<br>
temperature is low enough, the sections of track can snap.<br>
Because of the outcome of the snapping of sections of track is not as much of a safety hazard<br>
as buckling of track the neutral temperature is typically set above the average summertime<br>
temperature. In New Zealand the neutral temperature is set at around 30 degrees Celsius.<br>
Railway lines undergo considerable thermal cycling. They are also subjected to significant<br>
mechanical loading as trains ride over the rails. This can result in plastic deformation of the<br>
rails, that is, the rails stretch. When that happens the neutral temperature of the rails drops,<br>
and thus the risk of track buckling on hot days increases. It is generally accepted that railway<br>
lines need to be reset or restretched. More particularly, they need to be re-laid under tension<br>
in order to reset the neutral temperature every ten years or so to minimise the risk of<br>
buckling. At present it is a costly and time consuming exercise to uplift a railway line to<br>
restretch and relay it. Significant resources can be wasted on restretching sections of track<br>
that do not require any stretching.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a device and/or an apparatus for use in testing the<br>
integrity of metal components and sections of railway line that overcomes at least some of the<br>
abovementioned problems, or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to figure 1, a block diagram of general components of the apparatus of the invention,<br>
generally referred to as 1, is illustrated.<br>
The apparatus 1 can be provided to test the integrity of a metal component. The metal<br>
component can desirably be of any suitable type for testing purposes by vibration. It will be<br>
appreciated that references herein to a railway line can also be references to other metal<br>
components, including pipelines. However, for simplicity of description of the invention the<br>
embodiments thereof will refer herein to railway lines.<br>
Further, this invention is related to the invention as described in WO 97/04291 and US patent<br>
specification No. 6,026,687 and the full description of the patentee"s invention as described in<br>
those documents is incorporated herein as part of this description. A person skilled in the art<br>
would have ready access to those documents and the description contained therein when seeking<br>
to appreciate and understand aspects of the present invention.<br>
The apparatus 1 preferably includes a control means 2 in the form of a computer means having a<br>
microprocessor programmed to control the operation of the apparatus 1 and including the steps<br>
of obtaining measurements and data from the various measuring instruments, processing the<br>
inputted signals into a desirable form suitable for storage and/or display purposes. With respect<br>
to storage purposes the data may be manipulated to provide statistical data showing<br>
characteristics of the railway line or section of railway line 10 being tested.<br>
The control means 2 can function to control each step of the method of the invention. The<br>
control means 2 can desirably be powered by any suitable and durable battery means (not<br>
shown) for remote testing on say railway track away from an electrical power source and to<br>
allow the apparatus to have portable applications rather than merely laboratory workbench<br>
applications.<br>
A vibration means 3 can be mounted by any known and suitable securing means, such as for<br>
example a clamp, to an appropriate area of the railway line. Desirably the vibration means is in<br>
the form of a motor adapted with a vibration inducement means preferably in the form of<br>
eccentric weights mounted to the motor shaft that apply a vibration force on the line. Such force<br>
is adjustable such that the frequency of vibration can be changed as required. The vibration<br>
means 3 may include an exciter or shaker, as it is known in the art, that is desirably controlled by<br>
a user controlling and adjusting the speed of the motor 3. The motor 3 can be controlled by<br>
being associated with the control means 2.<br>
The motor speed of the vibration means can be sensed using any known form of motor speed<br>
measuring means and in this embodiment is in the form of a tachometer 4 that can be mounted<br>
to the shaft of the motor 3. The tachometer 4 measures the shaft speed and the measured signal<br>
outputs are fed to the control means 2.<br>
The amplitude of vibration induced on a section of railway line is sensed and measured using a<br>
signal measuring means in the form of a transducer means, desirably an accelerometer 5. It will<br>
be appreciated that any suitable known instrument may be used or applied.<br>
The accelerometer 5 generates an electrical signal in response to the vibration acceleration of the<br>
railway line as induced by the vibration means 3, and provides a signal that is fed to the control<br>
means 2. The control means 2 is configured and arranged to convert the signals into a<br>
measurement of frequency of vibration.<br>
A temperature measurement means 6 with a suitably sensitive sensing means can measure the<br>
temperature of the line during measurements. The temperature measurements means 6 is<br>
desirably in the form of a pyrometer and provides a measurement to the control means 2 that<br>
allows the temperature of the line to be tagged against other recorded data at the time of testing.<br>
A display means 7 can be provided to display the plotted measurements of velocity amplitude<br>
(for example, in mm/second) against the frequency of vibration and any other desirable<br>
characteristics of the data obtained in the testing phase of the operation.<br>
Referring now to figure 2, a system of attachment of the apparatus 1 to a section of railway line<br>
before testing of the said section of railway line, is illustrated.<br>
Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that railway lines undergo constant compression or<br>
tension caused by changes to temperature about the line and other factors. Rapid changes in<br>
temperature or unacceptably high or low temperatures can induce undesirable levels of stress<br>
that can cause railway lines to buckle.<br>
Some railway lines are joined in sections. Adjoining sections of line must be laid at a similar<br>
level of tension or compression, and can be desirably laid at a neutral state at a certain<br>
temperature. If adjoining sections are in a substantially different state and temperature<br>
fluctuations are rapid, buckling or other undesirable movements in the line can occur. The<br>
invention can assist with testing the integrity of railway lines to determine whether relaying or<br>
replacement of sections of line is required, and may provide an aid to the proper laying or<br>
relaying of railway lines.<br>
In one non-limiting method and system of testing, a section of railway line 10 for testing is seen<br>
in figure 2 as resting on five railway sleepers, defined as first sleeper A, second sleeper B, third<br>
sleeper C, fourth sleeper D, and fifth sleeper E. These five sleepers can be unclipped from the<br>
line to be tested or may be left clipped in position during testing, as required. The first sleeper A<br>
and the fifth sleeper E can be preferably rigidly secured and having ballast compacted and in<br>
contact with the sides of the first sleeper A and the fifth sleeper E such that the underside of the<br>
sleepers A and E can be in contact with the ballast. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the<br>
art that ballast can also be used on other sleepers as required to ensure proper contact during<br>
testing.<br>
The second sleeper B, the third sleeper C and the fourth sleeper D can be undipped from the line<br>
10. A packing member 11 in the form of a shim or the like is placed between the top of the<br>
second sleeper B and the underside of the line 10. A shim 11 can also be placed between the top<br>
of the fourth sleeper D and the underside of the railway line 10. A gap is advantageously left<br>
between the top of the third sleeper C and the underside of the railway line 10, generally<br>
indicated by 12.<br>
The arrangement of the second, third and fourth sleepers relative to the line 10 can be considered<br>
important for one form of testing in accordance with the system of testing using the apparatus 1.<br>
The accelerometer 5 can be mounted to the line 10 desirably above the fourth sleeper D.<br>
Advantageously the accelerometer 5 is mounted in a tuning arrangement as described below<br>
with reference to figures 3 and 4. The vibration means 3 can be coupled or mounted above the<br>
second sleeper B. The temperature measurement means 6 can be mounted in any suitable<br>
position on the line 10. All necessary data lines are connected to the control means 2 by hard<br>
wire 13 or otherwise, such as, for example, infra red or laser signal. Any known methods of<br>
data communications may be employed as required.<br>
In one operation, a method of testing the integrity of the line 10 is described. The vibration<br>
means 3 is activated and the accelerometer 5 provides a feedback signal to the control means 2.<br>
The signal can be processed to a digital form and a display means 7 displays a plot of the<br>
velocity amplitude of vibration (mm/sec) against the frequency of vibration (hertz). The<br>
frequency of vibration can be increased, generally in most applications testing can be achieved<br>
in the operating frequency range of between 0 to 100hz in some situations but may be increased<br>
to any suitable frequency up to substantially 500Hz or thereabouts as required. A reasonably<br>
linear measurement of amplitude of vibration is measurable by the accelerometer 5 that can also<br>
be displayed. The vibration may be increased until a noticeable spike is detected.<br>
With some railway lines a spike or loading node may be detected at between 50hz and 125hz. If<br>
the line is in tension the spike may be detected between 50hz and 75hz. If the line is in<br>
compression a noticeable spike is detectable at between about 85hz and 100hz. This information<br>
is useful for determining whether a section of railway line requires re-stretching or replacement<br>
and provide an indication of the condition of the line 10.<br>
It will be appreciated that in one alternative embodiment, the accelerometer 5 may be placed<br>
between the sleeper C and sleeper D and the vibration means 3 mounted above the second<br>
sleeper B to allow desirable and accurate measurements to be obtained in accordance with the<br>
invention. The accelerometer 5 and the vibration means 3 should preferably be mounted at least<br>
60 cm apart.<br>
Referring now to figures 3 and 4, a tuning arrangement for obtaining an electrical signal<br>
representing the frequency of vibration on a railway line, generally referred to as 20, is<br>
illustrated.<br>
The tuning arrangement 20 is designed to improve the quality of the signal by reducing errors<br>
caused by the standard clamping system incorporated with attaching or coupling an<br>
accelerometer directly to the railway line.<br>
A tuning device may desirably include an attachment member in the form of a base member 21<br>
that functions to anchor or couple the signal measuring means or transducer means to the<br>
railway line 30. The base member 21 may be preferably in the form of an L-cross section and is<br>
large enough to allow any suitable and durable clamping means 22 to clamp the tuning<br>
arrangement to the line 30. As seen clearly in figure 4, desirably the base member 21 is clamped<br>
to the outside of the line 30 as it is considered to be an area of the line that does not wear to the<br>
same extent as the inside head section of a standard two rail line.<br>
A tuning device 23 is made of any suitable and durable material, and functions to couple the<br>
transducer means in the form of an accelerometer 24 base member 21 via the elongate member<br>
23 and allow accurate measurements to be taken. A non-brittle elastic material can be suitably<br>
used, and a high tensile mild steel metal is desirable, as it is tough and ductile. A light metal<br>
with a high elasticity can be advantageous.<br>
The near end of the elongate member 23 can be located in a slot (not shown) in an edge of the<br>
base member 21 for increased coupling and attached to the base member 21 by any suitable<br>
attachment means. In this example screws 25 are shown. The accelerometer 24 can be secured<br>
to the elongate member 23 at the distal end. A dampening means 26 may be included adjacent<br>
the accelerometer 24 at the distal end of the elongate member 23.<br>
The dampening means 26 may desirably be in the form of a tubular dampener 26 having a<br>
hollow section allowing a material to be added within to set the desired tuning frequency of the<br>
tuning arrangement. Desirably sand is used in the dampener. In one desirable embodiment the<br>
dampener 26 can possibly be about 15 millimetres ("mm") in height and about 3 millimetres in<br>
diameter. Other dimensions and shapes are envisaged within the scope of the invention.<br>
In one non-limiting example, the elongate member 23 can be about 13.5 cm between the screw<br>
25 and the accelerometer 24 and be about 16mm in width and about 3 mm in thickness. These<br>
dimensions may be provided when the tuning device is being used to measure frequencies at<br>
about 78hz or 80hz.<br>
It may well be that a more sensitive tuning device 23 can be provided when the thickness of the<br>
device 23 is reduced.<br>
It will be appreciated that when the base member 21 is clamped to the line the tuning device 23<br>
is in parallel with the railway line. It is considered to be desirable to have the tuning device 23<br>
in parallel with the railway line for increased accuracy.<br>
In yet a further embodiment or set up arrangement for testing as an alternative to the previous<br>
methods as described with reference to figure 2, no shims or packing need be used, and the<br>
railway line 30 can remain clipped to the sleepers.<br>
In this method with undipped railway lines, the vibration means 3 is located over sleeper B, and<br>
the base member 21 is clamped, and more preferably can be T-clamped, to the line between<br>
sleeper C and sleeper D, and desirably halfway between sleeper C and sleeper D. The coupled<br>
tuning device 23 and accelerometer 24 may be positioned at about at least 60cm from the<br>
vibration means 3 and more preferably substantially about 70cm from the tuning device 23 to<br>
obtain more accurate results and to avoid or minimise interference from the vibration means 3.<br>
Advantageously, the feedback signal from the accelerometer 5 to the control means 2 can be<br>
provided to the control means 2 via an infra red or laser signal means. The receiver for the infra<br>
red or laser signal may be attached to a rail car that is movable on the line, and wherein the<br>
testing and measuring apparatus of the invention is located.<br>
It is considered that one desirable tuned frequency is 80hz as it is considered a suitable<br>
frequency for testing resulting in reasonable amplification of the velocity amplitude signals<br>
sensed by the accelerometer 24. This is bearing in mind that the resonant frequencies of many<br>
railway lines are well above this frequency.<br>
The invention further includes suitable computer software for controlling the operation of the<br>
computer or computer means that forms part of the control unit 2. Preferably the computer<br>
processing steps for controlling the operation of the apparatus for testing the integrity of a<br>
railway line includes the steps of obtaining data on the frequency of vibration of the line by<br>
using a suitable measuring device such as a tachometer. It will be appreciated that close control<br>
of the vibration means is possible using the tachometer to sense motor speed and to provide a<br>
signal to the control unit 2. The control unit 2 may then provide a signal to adjust motor speed<br>
as appropriate.<br>
The accelerometer 5 provides a signal of the amplitude of vibration of the line. The temperature<br>
measurement means 6 desirably provides a signal of the temperature of the line.<br>
Once this data has been obtained, the next step is executed in that a graph can be plotted<br>
showing the amplitude of vibration against the frequency of vibration at a determined<br>
temperature of the line. The resultant data is then recorded and can be later compared against<br>
other derived data as required.<br>
Preferably the computer processing steps further include the step of comparing the plots for a<br>
section of line being tested at different line temperatures and determining whether the line is in<br>
compression or tension.<br>
Desirably the processing steps included the preliminary step of obtaining a reference<br>
measurement of the velocity amplitude of the line when in a neutral position defined as being<br>
neither in compression or tension. This measurement can be recorded for comparison purposes<br>
for all plots at different line temperatures.<br>
Wherein the aforegoing reference has been made to integers or components having known<br>
equivalents, then such equivalents are herein incorporated as if individually set forth.<br>
Accordingly, it will be appreciated that changes may be made to the above described<br>
embodiments of the invention without departing from the principles taught herein.<br>
Additional advantages of the present invention will become apparent for those skilled in the art<br>
after considering the principles in particular form as discussed and illustrated. Thus, it will be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described or<br>
illustrated, but is intended to cover all alterations or modifications which are within the scope of<br>
