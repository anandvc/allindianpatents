METHODS FOR WASHING POULTRY DURING PROCESSING WITH MEDIUM CHAIN PEROXYCARBOXYLIC ACID COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for reducing microbial contamination on poultry, or on surfaces used in processing poultry, employing compositions including medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, and to the compositions. The methods include applying a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition to poultry or to the surfaces.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All poultry carcasses entering the processing environment are contaminated with microorganisms, some with pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella. Fecal matter and dirt are the main sources of this contamination. As a result of such contamination, poultry is typically washed at any of several steps during the process of converting a live bird to an edible food product. Such washing aims to remove dirt, offal, blood, viscera, other debris, and microbes from the poultry. Removing or reducing microbes aids the safe storage and consumption of poultry, yet many existing washing procedures fail to significantly reduce the microbe burden on poultry. The potential for poultry skin to become cross-contaminated is worsened by the ability of all types of microorganisms to adhere within only 15 seconds of contact. Once in the processing environment, a significant number of carcasses can become cross-contaminated with pathogens during handling, scalding, mechanical processing, and chilling. Current methods for many of these procedures also fail to significantly reduce the microbe burden on poultry.<br>
Water used for washing or these other procedures is often used repeatedly over time, which provides yet another opportunity for spreading, rather than reducing, microbial burden on poultry. For example, the water becomes contaminated with organic matter and microbes from the poultry, and the organic matter provides nutrients for microbial growth in the water over time or through additional use. These microbes can grow on and contaminate additional poultry and processing equipment. In particular, water left untreated in a submersion bath tends to decontaminate poultry early in a shift but contaminates poultry later in the shift. In fact, such water has been<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
identified as a potential source of coliform, E. coli and Salmonella contamination or cross contamination during poultry processing. Salmonella and other microorganisms are generally undesirable to the poultry, the water, and can cause buildup on all water contact surfaces of slime or biofilm, which requires frequent cleaning to remove.<br>
Microbial contamination or cross contamination of poultry via water continues to be a major concern for poultry processors and end users. Although washing, cooling, or heating poultry carcasses with water can reduce potential contamination, the processing water can also serve as a source of contamination or cross contamination. If pathogenic microorganisms in water are not removed, inactivated or otherwise controlled, they can spread to other poultry, potentially contaminating them. Further, handling or processing steps that pool many individual poultry parts tend to increase the risk that a single contaminated item may contaminate the entire lot. Immersing or spray-washing poultry in fresh water can help reduce surface populations of microorganisms. However sterilization by repeated washing, even with sterile water, cannot be achieved because microorganisms within tissues of poultry remain in place.<br>
The addition of antimicrobial agents to wash or process water can inactivate vegetative bacteria cells in water, helping avoid contamination. Ideally, an antimicrobial agent or compound used in such a system will have several important properties in addition to its antimicrobial efficacy. The compound or agent should have no technical effect on the final food product. Residual activity implies the presence of a film of antimicrobial material which will continue to have antimicrobial effect which may require further rinsing of the food product. The antimicrobial agent can also be odor free to prevent transfer of undesirable odors onto food stuffs. If direct food contact occurs, the antimicrobial agent should also be composed of food additive materials which will not affect food wholesomeness, nor affect humans should incidental ingestion result. In addition, the antimicrobial agent can be composed of naturally occurring or innocuous ingredients, which are chemically compatible with the environment and cause no concerns for toxic residues within the water.<br>
In the past, poultry wash or process waters have generally been treated with chlorinated compounds, organic acids, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate, or ozone. Generally, these materials are effective in reducing microbial contamination on poultry. However, the use rate of these antimicrobials is very high because they are<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
not effective at low concentrations or they tend to be rapidly consumed by the high organic load included with the poultry. Excessive chlorination of food processing water with hypochlorite has prompted concern over production of toxic or carcinogenic organochlorine compounds and other by-products.<br>
Further, the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial agents on the surface of poultry is often limited. For example, it has been reported that, generally, concentrations of more than 4 wt-% of organic acids or of 5 to 10 wt-% of trisodium phosphate are required to effectively reduce contamination of poultry skin by S. typhimurium. Antimicrobial agents such as peroxides or lactic acid can result in discoloring, bleaching, or bloating of poultry tissue.<br>
The EPA approved a peroxyacetic acid-based composition in 1996 for controlling microbial growth and reducing biofilm formation in fruit and vegetable transport or process waters. From a historical perspective, peroxyacetic acid has been used for food contact surface sanitizing, aseptic packaging and medical device cold-sterilization. In addition to its biocidal properties, the environmentally-friendly decomposition byproducts and good stability in the presence of organic matter helped gain acceptance of this technology among fruit and vegetable packers, handlers, and processors. Such conventional peroxycarboxylic acid compositions typically include short chain peroxycarboxylic acids or mixtures of short chain peroxycarboxylic acids and medium chain peroxycarboxylic acids (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,200,189, 5,314,687, 5,409,713, 5,437,868, 5,489,434, 6,674,538,6,010,729,6,111,963, and 6,514,556).<br>
Nevertheless, there remains a need for improved antimicrobial compositions for addition to waters used for washing or processing poultry.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for reducing microbial contamination on poultry, or on surfaces used in processing poultry, employing compositions including medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, and to the compositions. The methods include applying a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition to poultry or to the surface. The compositions and methods of the invention provide an antimicrobial agent useful in water for washing or processing poultry, that has a high degree of<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
antimicrobial efficacy, and that is safely ingestible by humans while imposing no unacceptable environmental incompatibility.<br>
The compositions of the invention and other medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial compositions can be employed in methods for reducing microbial contamination on poultry and in water used for washing or processing poultry. These methods include applying to the poultry during processing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example in an amount and time sufficient to reduce the microbial population. The composition can be applied by methods including submersing, rinsing, spraying, or air chilling the poultry, or a combination of these routes. During processing, the composition can be applied to whole, dismembered, portioned, or boned poultry.<br>
In an embodiment, the method includes recovering a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition previously applied to poultry. The recovered composition can be treated by adding a sufficient amount of a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid to yield a recycled medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition. The recycled medium chain composition includes a reduced level of microbes, such as human pathogens, and can be disposed of more safely. Alternatively, the recycled medium chain composition can be applied to poultry during processing. In an embodiment, the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid added to form the recycled composition is formed by adding a concentrate composition of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid to form a composition with suitable use antimicrobial levels of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
In an embodiment, water (e.g., medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition) that has been used to wash poultry can be recovered and recycled to wash poultry or the apparatus or plant used to transport or process poultry. In an embodiment, the method of recycling poultry wash water includes employing wash water recovered from one or more wash procedures at an earlier wash procedure in poultry processing. In an embodiment, the method of recycling poultry wash water includes employing wash water recovered from one or more wash procedures for washing apparatus in the poultry processing plant or parts of the plant itself.<br>
In an embodiment, the antimicrobial composition of the present invention includes medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, solubilizer, oxidizing agent, and<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
acidulant. Such a composition can include about 0.0005 to about 5 wt-% medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid; about 0.001 to about 10 wt-% medium chain carboxylic acid; about 0 to about 99.99 wt-% water; and about 0.001 to about 80 wt-% solubilizer effective for solubilizing the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid and the medium chain carboxylic acid. The composition can include a microemulsion and/or about 2 or more parts by weight of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid for each 7 parts by weight of medium chain carboxylic acid. In use form, the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition can include about 2 to about 500 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 2000 ppm medium chain carboxylic acid, about 95 to about 99.99 wt-% water; and about 2 to about 16,000 ppm solubilizer.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention Definitions<br>
As used herein, the phrase "medium chain carboxylic acid" refers to a carboxylic acid that: 1) has reduced or is lacking odor compared to the bad, pungent, or acrid odor associated with an equal concentration of small chain carboxylic acid, and 2) has a critical micellar concentration greater than 1 mM in aqueous buffers at neutral pH. Medium chain carboxylic acids exclude carboxylic acids that are infinitely soluble in or miscible with water at 20 CC. Medium chain carboxylic acids include carboxylic acids with boiling points (at 760 mm Hg pressure) of 180 to 300 °C. In an embodiment, medium chain carboxylic acids include carboxylic acids with boiling points (at 760 mm Hg pressure) of 200 to 300 °C. In an embodiment, medium chain carboxylic acids include those with solubility in water of less than 1 g/L at 25 °C. Examples of medium chain carboxylic acids include pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid" refers to the peroxycarboxylic acid form of a medium chain carboxylic acid.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "short chain carboxylic acid" refers to a carboxylic acid that: 1) has characteristic bad, pungent, or acrid odor, and 2) is infinitely soluble in or miscible with water at 20 °C. Examples of short chain carboxylic acids include formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid.<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
As used herein, the phrase "short chain peroxycarboxylic acid" refers to the peroxycarboxylic acid form of a short chain carboxylic acid.<br>
As used herein, the term "solubilizer" refers to a component of the present compositions to that makes soluble or increases the solubility in a carrier (e.g., water) of the medium chain carboxylic acid, medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, or mixture thereof. For example, in an embodiment, the solubilizer can keep a composition including medium chain carboxylic acid, medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, or mixture thereof in solution or can keep the composition finely and evenly dispersed under ordinary storage conditions without forming a separate layer. The solubilizer can, for example, solubilize a medium chain carboxylic acid to an extent sufficient to allow it to react with an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide. A solubilizer can be identified by a test that measures phase separation under ordinary storage conditions, such as room temperature, 100 °F, or 60 °C. As used herein, the term "solubilizer" does not include short chain carboxylic acids; they are not solubilizers.<br>
As used herein, the term "mieroemulsion" refers to a thermodynamically stable dispersion of one liquid phase into another stabilized by an interfacial film of surfactant. The dispersion can be oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Microemulsions are typically clear solutions when the droplet diameter is approximately 100 nanometers or less. In an embodiment, the present mieroemulsion composition is a shear thinning viscoelastic gel that has a blue tyndall appearance.<br>
As used herein, the phrases "blue tyndall appearance" or "blue tyndall" refer to a bluish hue due to scattering of blue light or the blue region of the light spectrum.<br>
As used herein, the phrases "viscoelastic gel" and "viscoelastic liquid" refer to a liquid composition that exhibits both viscous and elastic characteristics or responses, which is indicative of long range order or structure.<br>
As used herein, a composition or combination "consisting essentially" of certain ingredients refers to a composition including those ingredients and lacking any ingredient that materially affects the basic and novel characteristics of the composition or method. The phrase "consisting essentially of excludes from the claimed compositions and methods short chain carboxylic acids, short chain peroxycarboxylic acids, or mixtures thereof; unless such an ingredient is specifically listed after the phrase.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
As used herein, a composition or combination "substantially free of one or more ingredients refers to a composition that includes none of that ingredient or that includes only trace or incidental amounts of that ingredient. Trace or incidental amounts can include the amount of the ingredient found in another ingredient as an impurity or that is generated in a minor side reaction during formation or degradation of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "a level insufficient to solubilize" refers to a concentration of an ingredient at which the ingredient is not sufficient to solubilize an insoluble material and to keep the composition substantially in one phase.<br>
As used herein, the phrases "objectionable odor", "offensive odor", or "malodor" refer to a sharp, pungent, or acrid odor or atmospheric environment from which a typical person withdraws if they are able to. Hedonic tone provides a measure of the degree to which an odor is pleasant or unpleasant. An "objectionable odor", "offensive odor", or "malodor" has an hedonic tone rating it as unpleasant as or more unpleasant than a solution of 5 wt-% acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, or mixtures thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "microorganism" refers to any noncellular or unicellular (including colonial) organism. Microorganisms include all prokaryotes. Microorganisms include bacteria (including cyanobacteria), lichens, fungi, protozoa, virinos, viroids, viruses, phages, and some algae. As used herein, the term "microbe" is synonymous with microorganism.<br>
As used herein the term "poultry" refers to all forms of any bird kept, harvested, or domesticated for meat or eggs, and including chicken, turkey, ostrich, game hen, squab, guinea fowl, pheasant, quail, duck, goose, emu, or the like and the eggs of these birds. Poultry includes whole, sectioned, processed, cooked or raw poultry, and encompasses all forms of poultry flesh, by-products, and side products. The flesh of poultry includes muscle, fat, organs, skin, bones and body fluids and like components that form the animal. Forms of animal flesh include, for example, the whole or part of animal flesh, alone or in combination with other ingredients. Typical forms include, for example, processed poultry meat, such as cured poultry meat, sectioned and formed products, minced products, finely chopped products and whole products.<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US200S/000147<br>
As used herein, the phrase "poultry processing surface" refers to a surface of a tool, a machine, equipment, a structure, a building, or the like that is employed as part of a poultry processing, preparation, or storage activity. Examples of poultry processing surfaces include surfaces of poultry processing or preparation equipment, of poultry processing wares or utensils, and of floors, walls, or fixtures of structures in which poultry processing occurs. Poultry processing utensils or tools include stunning apparatus, knife, sharpening steel, sharpening stone, scabbard and belt for holding knives, meat saw, cleaver, conveyor, bucket, working platform, scalding barrel or tank, pot, barrel or system for boiling water, scrapers, scraping table or platform, thermometer, hook, bleeding hooks, blood-catching trough, wash trough, hand washbasin, rack, table, tank, cutting table, tote, bin, wrapping table, paper or plastic foil/bags for poultry wrapping, tool holder, metal mask, safety glove, boning apron, safety apron, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "poultry processing machinery" refers to equipment used from first processing or slaughter through chilling and includes conveyor, shackle, killing machine, blood tunnel, scalder, picking machine, post-picking rinse cabinet, feet "hock" cutter, head cutter, neck breaker/oil (preen) gland remover, vent cutter, opening machine, evisceration machine, pack puller, crop remover, lung remover, carcass washer, inside-out washer, antimicrobial rinse cabinet, chiller; and also refers to equipment used for second processing or processing parts (e.g., deboning, and portion control) and including carcass splitter, deboner, cutters, and packaging.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "poultry debris" refers to any debris, residue, material, dirt, offal, poultry part, poultry waste, poultry viscera, poultry organ, fragments or combinations of such materials, and the like removed from a poultry carcass or portion during processing and that enters a waste stream.<br>
As used herein, the terms "mixed" or "mixture" when used relating to "peroxycarboxylic acid composition" or "peroxycarboxylic acids" refer to a composition or mixture including more than one peroxycarboxylic acid, such as a composition or mixture including peroxyacetic acid and peroxyoctanoic acid.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "densified fluid" refers to a fluid in a critical, subcritical, near critical, or supercritical state. The fluid is generally a gas at standard conditions of one atmosphere pressure and 0 °C. As used herein, the phrase<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
"supercritical fluid" refers to a dense gas that is maintained above its critical temperature, the temperature above which it cannot be liquefied by pressure. Supercritical fluids are typically less viscous and diffuse more readily than liquids. In an embodiment, a densified fluid is at, above, or slightly below its critical point. As used herein, the phrase "critical point" is the transition point at which the liquid and gaseous states of a substance merge into each other and represents the combination of the critical temperature and critical pressure for a substance. The critical pressure is a pressure just sufficient to cause the appearance of two phases at the critical temperature. Critical temperatures and pressures have been reported for numerous organic and inorganic compounds and several elements.<br>
As used herein, the terms "near critical" fluid or "subcritical" fluid refer to a fluid material that is typically below the critical temperature of a supercritical fluid, but remains in a fluid state and denser than a typical gas due to the effects of pressure on the fluid. In an embodiment, a subcritical or near critical fluid is at a temperature and/or pressure just below its critical point. For example, a subcritical or near critical fluid can be below its critical temperature but above its critical pressure, below its critical pressure but above its critical temperature, or below both its critical temperature and pressure. The terms near critical and subcritical do not refer to materials in their ordinary gaseous or liquid state.<br>
As used herein, the term "about" modifying the quantity of an ingredient in the compositions of the invention or employed in the methods of the invention refers to variation in the numerical quantity that can occur, for example, through typical measuring and liquid handling procedures used for making concentrates or use solutions in the real world; through inadvertent error in these procedures; through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of the ingredients employed to make the compositions or carry out the methods; and the like. The term about also encompasses amounts that differ due to different equilibrium conditions for a composition resulting from a particular initial mixture. Whether or not modified by the term "about", the claims include equivalents to the quantities.<br>
Differentiation of antimicrobial "-cidal" or "-static" activity, the definitions which describe the degree of efficacy, and the official laboratory protocols for measuring this efficacy are considerations for understanding the relevance of<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
antimicrobial agents and compositions. Antimicrobial compositions can effect two kinds of microbial cell damage. The first is a lethal, irreversible action resulting in complete microbial cell destruction or incapacitation. The second type of cell damage is reversible, such that if the organism is rendered free of the agent, it can again multiply. The former is termed microbiocidal and the later, microbistatic. A sanitizer and a disinfectant are, by definition, agents which provide antimicrobial or microbiocidal activity. In contrast, a preservative is generally described as an inhibitor or microbistatic composition.<br>
For the purpose of this patent application, successful microbial reduction is achieved when the microbial populations are reduced by at least about 50%, or by significantly more than is achieved by a wash with water. Larger reductions in microbial population provide greater levels of protection for processed poultry product.<br>
As used herein, a composition or combination "consisting essentially" of certain ingredients refers to a composition including those ingredients and lacking any ingredient that materially affects the basic and novel characteristics of the composition or method. The phrase "consisting essentially of excludes from the claimed compositions and methods: a coupling agent; an ingredient that cannot be employed in food products or in food wash, handling, or processing according to U.S. government rules or regulations; and/or a peroxycarboxylic acid or carboxylic acid with 10 or more carbon atoms; unless such an ingredient is specifically listed after the phrase.<br>
Poultry Processing Employing Medium Chain Pcroxycarboxylie Acid Compositions<br>
The concentrate and use compositions of the present invention can be employed for a variety of antimicrobial purposes, for example as or for forming water-based systems for processing and/or washing poultry. The present compositions and methods can be employed for processing poultry and/or poultry meat at any step from gathering the live birds through packaging the final product. For example, the present compositions and methods can employed for washing, rinsing, chilling, or scalding poultry carcasses, poultry carcass parts, or poultry organs for reducing contamination of these items with spoilage/decay-causing microorganisms, and pathogenic microorganisms.<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
Before processing, live poultry are generally transported to and gathered at the beginning of a processing line. Poultry can be washed before entering the processing line. Processing typically begins with sacrificing the bird, for example, by electrical stunning, followed by neck cutting and bleeding. A first washing step, known as scalding (e.g. submersion or immersion scalding) can follow bleeding and loosens attachment of feathers to poultry skin. Submersion scalding can be accomplished according to the methods and employing compositions of the present invention. Submersion scalding can include immersing a stunned and bled bird into a scalding hot bath of water or a liquid antimicrobial composition, for example, at a temperature of about 50 to about 80 CC or about 50 to about 60 CC. The liquid antimicrobial composition in the bath can be agitated, sonicated, or pumped to increase contact of the composition with the carcass. Scalding can be conducted in a scald tank or trough, which contains the scalding liquid with sufficient liquid depth to completely submerse the poultry carcass. The carcass can be transported through the tank or trough by conveyor at a speed that provides a few minutes in the scalding liquid.<br>
According to the present invention, the scalding bath can include a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example, a composition of the present invention. In an embodiment, the scalding hot bath contains a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition with about 2 to about 50 ppm, about 10 to about 200 ppm, or about 10 to about 20 ppm of peroxycarboxylic, and amounts and additional ingredients as described herein. The scalding bath can also include one or more of the additional ingredients permitted in scalding baths.<br>
After submersion scalding, the poultry can be picked, rinsed, and, optionally, singed before the next washing process. This second washing process is generally known as "dress" rinsing, "New York dress" rinsing, or post-pick rinsing, which rinses residual feathers and follicle residues from the carcass. Dress rinsing can include spraying a picked carcass with water, for example, at a temperature of about 5 to about 30 °C. To increase contact with the carcass, the antimicrobial compositions in the spray water can be applied at higher pressures, flow rates, temperatures, or with agitation or ultrasonic energy. Dress rinsing can be accomplished with a washing apparatus such as a wash or spray cabinet with stationary or moving spray nozzles. Alternatively, a<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2U05/U67741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
"flood"-rinsing or liquid submersion washing apparatus may be used immediately after picking.<br>
According to the present invention, picker rinsing or dress rinsing can be accomplished employing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example a composition of the present invention. For example, the dress rinsing can employ a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition with about 2 to about 500, about 10 to about 200, about 50 to about 300 ppm, or about 100 to about 200 ppm of peroxycarboxylic acid, and additional ingredients as described herein.<br>
Dress rinsing can be a final washing step before dismembering the poultry. Dismembering can include removing the head, the feet, eviscerating, and removing the neck, in any order commonly employed in poultry processing. Washing can also occur during dismembering. The dismembered and eviscerated poultry can then be subjected to a washing step known as inside-outside bird washing (IOBW). Inside-outside bird washing washes the interior (body cavity) and exterior of the bird. Inside-outside bird washing can include rinsing the interior and exterior surfaces of the carcass with streams or floods of water, for example, at a temperature of about 5 to about 30 °C. To increase contact with the carcass, the antimicrobial compositions in the spray water can be applied at higher pressures, flow rates, temperatures, or with agitation or ultrasonic energy. Inside-outside bird washing can be accomplished by an apparatus that floods the bird carcass with streams of water in the inner cavity and over the exterior of the carcass. Such an apparatus can include a series of fixed spray nozzles to apply antimicrobial composition to the exterior of the bird and a rinse probe or bayonet that enters and applies antimicrobial composition to the body cavity.<br>
According to the present invention, inside-outside bird washing can be accomplished employing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example, a composition of the present invention. For example, inside-outside bird washing can employ a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition with about 2 to about 500, about 10 to about 200, about 20 to about 200 ppm, or about 50 to about 100 ppm of peroxycarboxylic acid, and additional ingredients as described herein.<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
After inside-outside bird washing, both the interior and the exterior of the bird can be subjected to further decontamination. This further decontamination can be accomplished in part by a step commonly known as antimicrobial spray rinsing, sanitizing rinsing, or finishing rinsing. Such rinsing can include spraying the interior and exterior surfaces of the carcass with water, for example, at a temperature of about 5 to about 30 °C. To increase contact with the carcass, the antimicrobial compositions in the spray water can be applied using fixed or articulating nozzles, at higher pressures, flow rates, temperatures, with agitation or ultrasonic energy, or with rotary brushes. Spray rinsing can be accomplished by an apparatus such as a spray cabinet with stationary or moving spray nozzles. The nozzles create a mist, vapor, or spray that contacts the carcass surfaces.<br>
According to the present invention, antimicrobial spray rinsing, sanitizing rinsing, or finishing rinsing can be accomplished employing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example, a composition of the present invention. For example, spray rinsing can employ a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition with about 2 to about 500, about 10 to about 200, about 50 to about 300 ppm, or about 100 to about 200 ppm of peroxycarboxylic acid, and additional ingredients as described herein.<br>
After spray rinsing, the bird can be made ready for packaging or for further processing by chilling, specifically submersion chilling or air chilling. Submersion chilling both washes and cools the bird to retain quality of the meat. Submersion chilling can include submersing the carcass completely in water or slush, for example, at a temperature of less than about 5 °C, until the temperature of the carcass approaches that of the water or slush. Chilling of the carcass can be accomplished by submersion in a single bath, or in two or more stages, each of a lower temperature. Water can be applied with agitation or ultrasonic energy to increase contact with the carcass. Submersion chilling can be accomplished by an apparatus such as a tank containing the chilling liquid with sufficient liquid depth to completely submerse the poultry carcass. The carcass can be conveyed through the chiller by various mechanisms, such as an auger feed or a drag bottom conveyor. Submersion chilling can also be accomplished by tumbling the carcass in a chilled water cascade.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
According to the present invention, submersion chilling can be accomplished employing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, for example, a composition of the present invention. For example, submersion chilling can employ a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition with about 2 to about 500, about 10 to about 200, about 2 to about 100 ppm, or about 2 to about 30 ppm of peroxycarboxylic acid, and additional ingredients as described herein.<br>
Like submersion chilling, air chilling or cryogenic chilling cools the bird to retain quality of the meat. Air cooling can be less effective for decontaminating the bird, as the air typically would not dissolve, suspend, or wash away contaminants. Air chilling with a gas including an antimicrobial agent can, however, reduce the burden of microbial, and other, contaminants on the bird. Air chilling can include enclosing the carcass in a chamber having a temperature below about 5 °C until the carcass is chilled. Air chilling can be accomplished by applying a cryogenic fluid or gas as a blanket or spray.<br>
According to the present invention, air chilling can be accomplished employing a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, e.g., a composition of the present invention. For example, air chilling compositions can include a gaseous or densified fluid medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition.<br>
After chilling, the bird can be subjected to additional processing steps including post-chill submersion, post-chill spray, weighing, quality grading, allocation, portioning, deboning, and the like. This further processing can also include methods or compositions according to the present invention for washing with medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions. For example, it can be advantageous to wash poultry portions, such as legs, breast quarters, wings, and the like, formed by portioning the bird. Such portioning forms or reveals new meat, skin, or bone surfaces which may be subject to contamination and benefit from treatment with medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition. Similarly, deboning a poultry carcass or a portion of a poultry carcass can expose additional areas of the meat or bone to microbial contamination. Washing the deboned poultry carcass or portion with a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition can advantageously reduce any such contamination. In addition, during any further processing, the deboned meat can also come into contact with microbes, for example, on contaminated surfaces. Washing the<br>
14<br><br>
PCT/US2005/000147 WO 2005/067741<br>
deboned meat with a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition can reduce such contamination. Washing can be accomplished by spraying, immersing, tumbling, or a combination thereof, or by applying a gaseous or densified fluid antimicrobial composition.<br>
Usable side products of poultry include heart, liver, and gizzard (e.g. giblets), neck, feet, and the like. These are typically harvested later in processing, and are sold as food products. Of course, microbial contamination of such food products is undesirable. Thus, these side products can also be washed with a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition in methods of the present invention. Typically, these side products will be washed after harvesting from the poultry carcass and before packaging. They can be washed by submersion or spraying, or transported in a flume including the antimicrobial composition. They can be contacted with an antimicrobial composition according to the invention in a giblet chiller or ice chiller.<br>
The poultry, poultry product, poultry portion, poultry side product, or the like can be packaged before sending it to more processing, to another processor, into commerce, or to the consumer. Any such poultry can be washed with a water based medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition, which can then be removed (e.g., drained, blown, or blotted) from the poultry. In certain circumstances wetting the poultry before packaging is disadvantageous. In such circumstances, a gaseous or densified fluid form of the peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition can be employed for reducing the microbial burden on the poultry. Such a gaseous composition can be employed in a variety of processes known for exposing poultry to a gas before or during packaging, such as modified atmosphere packaging.<br>
The advantageous stability of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions in such methods, which include the presence of poultry debris or residue, makes these compositions competitive with cheaper, less stable, and potentially toxic chlorinated compounds. Embodiments of methods of the present invention include agitation or sonication of the use composition, particularly as a concentrate is added to water to make the use composition. In an embodiment, the present methods include water systems that have some agitation, spraying, or other mixing of the solution. The poultry product can be contacted with the compositions of the invention effective to result in a reduction significantly greater than is achieved by washing with water, or at<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
least a 50% reduction, at least a 90% reduction, or at least a 99% reduction in the resident microbial preparation.<br>
The present methods can employ a certain minimal contact time of the composition with poultry for occurrence of significant antimicrobial effect. The contact time can vary with concentration of the use composition, method of applying the use composition, temperature of the use composition, amount of soil on the poultry, number of microorganisms on the poultry, or the like. In an embodiment, the exposure time is at least about 5 to about 15 seconds.<br>
Spraying Poultry<br>
An embodiment of the present method for washing poultry employs a pressure spray of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition. During application of the spray solution on the poultry product, the surface of the poultry product can be moved with mechanical action, e.g., agitated, rubbed, brushed, etc. Agitation can be by physical scrubbing of the poultry product, through the action of the spray solution under pressure, through sonication, or by other methods. Agitation increases the efficacy of the spray solution in killing micro-organisms, perhaps due to better exposure of the solution into the crevasses or small colonies containing the microorganisms. The spray solution, before application, can also be heated to a temperature of about 15 to 20 °C or about 20 to 60 °C to increase efficacy.<br>
Application of the material by spray can be accomplished using a manual spray wand application, an automatic spray of poultry product moving along a production line using multiple spray heads to ensure complete contact, or other spray apparatus. One automatic spray application involves the use of a spray booth. The spray booth substantially confines the sprayed composition to within the parameter of the booth. The production line moves the poultry product through the entryway into the spray booth in which the poultry product is sprayed on all its exterior surfaces with sprays within the booth. After a complete coverage of the material and drainage of the material from the poultry product within the booth, the poultry product can then exit the booth in a fully treated form. The spray booth can include steam jets that can be used to apply the antimicrobial compositions of the invention. These steam jets can be used in combination with cooling water to ensure that the treatment reaching the poultry<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US200S/000147<br>
product surface is less than 65°C, or less than 60°C. The temperature of the spray on the poultry product can ensure that the poultry product is not substantially altered (cooked) by the temperature of the spray. The spray pattern can be virtually any useful spray pattern.<br>
Immersing Poultry<br>
During processing of the poultry product, the poultry product can be immersed into a tank containing a quantity of washing solution. The washing solution can be agitated to increase the efficacy of the solution and the speed in which the solution reduces micro-organisms accompanying to the poultry product. Agitation can be obtained by conventional methods, including ultrasonics, aeration by bubbling air through the solution, by mechanical methods, such as strainers, paddles, brushes, pump driven liquid jets, or by combinations of these methods. The washing solution can be heated to increase the efficacy of the solution in killing micro-organisms. In an embodiment, the poultry product can be immersed in the washing solution after the poultry product has been eviscerated and before any cooling process such as a chiller tank or a chill water spray. In an embodiment, the poultry product can be immersed in the washing composition post-chill.<br>
Foam Treating Poultry<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the poultry product can be treated with a foaming version of the composition. The foam can be prepared by mixing foaming surfactants with the washing solution at time of use. The foaming surfactants can be nonionic, anionic or cationic in nature. Examples of useful surfactant types include, but are not limited to the following: alcohol ethoxylates, alcohol ethoxylate carboxylate, amine oxides, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfate, sulfonates, quaternary ammonium compounds, alkyl sarcosines, betaines and alkyl amides. The foaming surfactant can be mixed at time of use with the washing solution. Use solution levels of the foaming agents is from about 50 ppm to about 2.0 wt-%. At time of use, compressed air can be injected into the mixture, then applied to the poultry product surface through a foam application device such as a tank foamer or an aspirated wall mounted foamer.<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/U00147<br>
Gel Treating Poultry<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the poultry product can be treated with a thickened or gelled version of the composition. In the thickened or gelled state the washing solution remains in contact with the poultry product surface for longer periods of time, thus increasing the antimicrobial efficacy. The thickened or gelled solution will also adhere to vertical surfaces. The composition or the washing solution can be thickened or gelled using existing technologies such as: xanthan gum, polymeric thickeners, cellulose thickeners or the like. Rod micelle forming systems such as amine oxides and anionic counter ions could also be used. The thickeners or gel forming agents can be used either in the concentrated product or mixing with the washing solution, at time of use. Typical use levels of thickeners or gel agents range from about 100 ppm to about 10 wt-%.<br>
Light Treating Poultry<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the poultry product can be exposed to an activating light (or other electromagnetic radiation) source following application of the washing solution. The activating light (or other electromagnetic radiation) can improve the antimicrobial efficacy of the washing solution. The light can be ultraviolet light, infrared light, visible light, or a combination thereof. Other forms of electromagnetic radiation include radar and microwave.<br>
Processing Poultry Wash Water<br>
Washing poultry can employ a large volume of water, or another carrier. Poultry wash water can be used more than once (recycled), provided the water can be treated so that it does not transfer undesirable microbes to the poultry being washed with the recycled wash water. One way to prevent the transfer of such undesirable microbes, is to reduce the microbial burden of the recycled wash water by adding a mixture of peroxycarboxylic acids. For example, if the fluid to be recycled is water-based and lacking any peroxycarboxylic acid, a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid concentrate composition can be added to result in an effective antimicrobial concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid in the fluid to be recycled. Alternatively, if the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
fluid to be recycled already includes or has included a peroxycarboxylic acid, a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid concentrate composition can be added to increase any concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid to an effective-antimicrobial level. It may be that the peroxycarboxylic acid in the solution to be recycled has been totally depleted, in which case more of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition is added.<br>
In some circumstances, the water to be recycled includes a substantial burden of organic matter or microbes. If this is the case, the water may be unsuitable for recycling. However, if the water is to be recycled, the operator adds a sufficient quantity of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition to provide an effective antimicrobial amount of the peroxycarboxylic acid after a certain amount is consumed by the organic burden or microbes already present. Then, the recycled fluid can be used with antimicrobial effect. Routine testing can be employed for determining levels of peroxycarboxylic acid, or of organic burden.<br>
In each case, the method of recycling the poultry wash water includes recovering the poultry wash water, adding a composition including medium chain peroxycarboxylic acids, and reusing the poultry wash water for washing poultry, for example, as described above. The poultry wash water can be recovered from steps in poultry processing including submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, spray rinsing, and submersion chilling. Methods of recovering wash water from these steps are well-known to those skilled in the poultry washing and/or processing arts. The wash water can also be strained, filtered, diluted, or otherwise cleaned and processed during recycling.<br>
In an embodiment, water (e.g., medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition) that has been used to wash poultry can be recovered and recycled to wash poultry or the apparatus or plant used to transport or process poultry. In this embodiment, the water can be treated so that it does not transfer undesirable microbes to the poultry, apparatus, or plant being washed with the recycled wash water. Not transferring undesirable microbes be accomplished by employing a recycled composition that is free of pathogenic microorganisms, that is free of fecal coliform organisms, or free of both. Not transferring undesirable microbes can include reducing contamination (e.g., physical, chemical, or microbiological contamination) of the recycled composition to prevent adulteration of product. Not transferring undesirable<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
microbes can include reducing contamination (e.g., physical, chemical, or microbiological contamination) of the recycled composition to prevent contamination or adulteration of product. The water can be treated by adding medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid concentrate composition, by filtering or straining the water, and/or by light treating the water. The method of recycling the poultry wash water then includes reusing the poultry wash water for washing poultry, for example, as described above.<br>
In an embodiment, the method of recycling poultry wash water (e.g., medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition) includes employing wash water recovered from one or more wash procedures at an earlier wash procedure in poultry processing. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from submersion chilling; treating the water; and employing the treated wash water in at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, and spray rinsing. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from spray rinsing; treating the water; and employing the treated wash water in at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, and inside-outside bird washing. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from inside-outside bird washing; treating the water; and employing the treated wash water in at least one of submersion scalding and dress rinsing. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from dress rinsing; treating the water; and employing the treated wash water in submersion scalding.<br>
In an embodiment, the method of recycling poultry wash water (e.g., medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition) includes employing wash water recovered from one or more wash procedures for washing apparatus in the poultry processing plant or parts of the plant itself (e.g., floors, walls, exterior pavement, or the like). For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, spray rinsing, and submersion chilling; treating the water; and employing the treated water for washing processing apparatus. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, spray rinsing, and submersion chilling; treating the water; and employing the treated water for washing a portion of the processing plant, such as a<br>
20<br><br>
WO 200S/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
floor, a wall, or exterior pavement. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, spray rinsing, and submersion chilling; treating the water; and employing the treated water for washing trucks or cages, for example, those in which poultry was transported to the plant. For example, the present method can include recovering poultry wash water from at least one of submersion scalding, dress rinsing, inside-outside bird washing, spray rinsing, and submersion chilling; treating the water; and employing the treated water for washing poultry entering the plant.<br>
Test Methods for Reducing Microbial Populations on Poultry<br>
Spray application of an antimicrobial composition of the invention can be tested and shown to significantly reduce bacterial pathogen contamination on poultry carcass samples. Carcass samples can be contaminated with, for example, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13311, Escherichia coli serotype 0157:H7 ATCC 43895, or Listeria monocytogenes (Petite Scott A) ATCC 49594. Identities of these bacteria can be confirmed based on gram stain reactions, microscopic morphology and growth characteristics using the appropriate selective medium. These strains can be grown in culture, by conventional techniques, and adjusted to yield, for example, &gt;107 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL).<br>
Carcass samples can be prepared by inoculating the exterior of a thawed piece of chicken skin with a suitable volume of a pathogen culture. The square of skin can be depressed to form a bowl, and the culture can be allowed to sit in this bowl for, for example, 5 min to allow attachment of the bacteria. After attachment, culture can be removed from the skin sample and each sample can be placed on a metal stand, epidermal side/inoculated side up.<br>
The skin sample can be then sprayed with an antimicrobial composition. For use, the composition can be diluted to, for example, 200±10 ppm total medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. The poultry carcass sample can be sprayed with the composition for, for example, 15 seconds at 60 psi and room temperature.<br>
After spraying, the skin samples can be aseptically removed and placed into solution including an agent that inactivates the peroxycarboxylic acids without killing bacteria. The remaining bacteria can be suspended by vortexing and serial dilutions of<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
this solution can be plated for growth of the bacteria. Dilutions can be prepared using phosphate buffered dilution water (PBDW). S. typhimurium and L. monocytogenes plates can be incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. E. coli O157:H7 plates can be incubated at 37 CC for 24 hours. For each sample, the number of colony forming units per skin square can be calculated.<br>
Analysis of the numbers of bacteria on skin samples can demonstrate that spray application of the antimicrobial composition of the invention significantly reduces levels of, for example, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes.<br>
Submersion application of an antimicrobial composition of the invention can be tested and shows significant reduction of bacterial pathogen contamination on poultry carcass samples.<br>
Bacteria can be selected and cultured generally as described above, except that the bacteria can be diluted to, for example, &gt;106 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) for inoculation of carcass samples.<br>
Carcass samples can be prepared by thawing frozen chicken wings and livers. The thawed samples can be inoculated by submersing in the suspension of bacteria. Other surfaces can be not inoculated. The inoculated surface can be marked for identification and allowed to drain and sit for 5 min at room temperature.<br>
The antimicrobial composition can be as described above. The use solution can be diluted to, for example, 30 ppm total medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. Antimicrobial agent can be applied by submersing the inoculated and uninoculated surfaces, for example, for 60 min in the same 2 liters of a use solution of the antimicrobial agent at 4 °C. The same experiment can be performed using water without the antimicrobial agent.<br>
After submersing, the inoculated and uninoculated surfaces can be removed from the antimicrobial agent use solution or water and gently agitated solution including an agent that inactivates the peroxycarboxylic acids without killing bacteria. Removing and analyzing the uninoculated surfaces can be necessary to measure cross contamination of bacteria from the inoculated surfaces. Serial dilutions of this solution can be plated for growth of the bacteria as described above in Example 2. Cross contamination log reduction can be calculated by subtracting the Log number of<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
bacteria on uninoculated surfaces submersed in the antimicrobial use solution from the Log number of surviving bacteria on uninoculated surfaces submersed in water.<br>
Analysis of the numbers of bacteria on carcass samples can demonstrate that submersion application of the antimicrobial composition of the invention significantly reduces levels of, for example, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes.<br>
Medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobial composition in water can be used for spraying or submersing eviscerated chicken carcasses and can provide a reduction of, for example, total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and Escherichia coli.<br>
Freshly collected chicken carcasses can be subjected to spraying with or submersion in an antimicrobial composition described above. Use solutions, spray time and pressure, and submersion temperature and duration can be as described above. Some carcasses can be both sprayed and submersed. Control carcasses can be untreated.<br>
Each carcass can be then placed in a collection bag using freshly gloved hands. In the bag, the carcass can be rinsed with Butterfield's Phosphate Diluent (BPD) and the BPD solution collected for microbiology testing. Known, standard procedures for quantifying, for example, total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and Escherichia coli can be employed.<br>
Analysis of the numbers of bacteria on carcass samples can demonstrate that spray, submersion, and combination application of the antimicrobial composition of the invention significantly reduces levels of, for example, total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and Escherichia coli.<br>

Peroxycarboxylic acids can be made by the direct action of an oxidizing agent on a carboxylic acid, by autoxidation of aldehydes, or from acid chlorides, and hydrides, or carboxylic anhydrides with hydrogen or sodium peroxide. In an embodiment, the medium chain percarboxylic acids can be made by the direct, acid catalyzed equilibrium action of hydrogen peroxide on the medium chain carboxylic acid. Scheme 1 illustrates an equilibrium between carboxylic acid and oxidizing agent (Ox) on one side and peroxycarboxylic acid and reduced oxidizing agent (Oxreci) on the other:<br>
RCOOH + Ox ? RCOOOH + Oxred (1)<br>

Surfactant Solubilizers and Compositions Including Them<br>
In an embodiment, the present compositions and methods can include as solubilizer one or more (e.g., at least one) surfactants, e.g., a microemulsion forming surfactant. Suitable surfactants include anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, zwitterionic surfactant, mixtures thereof, or the like. Suitable microemulsion forming surfactants include anionic surfactant, cationic surfactant, amphoteric surfactant, zwitterionic surfactant, mixtures thereof, or the like. Suitable microemulsion forming surfactants include anionic surfactant. A microemulsion forming surfactant can form a microemulsion in a composition including a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, a medium chain carboxylic acid, or a mixture thereof. In an embodiment, the present composition includes a microemulsion.<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition can be determined to be a microemulsion by testing the composition for being a shear thinning viscoelastic gel or liquid that has a blue tyndall appearance. Although not limiting to the present invention, blue tyndall appearance is believed to indicate a heterogeneous system of a small, suspended dispersion (e.g., a microemulsion), which is effective in scattering blue light.<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition can be determined to be a microemulsion by testing the ability to form a physically stable composition at different concentrations of surfactant solubilizer. A microemulsion can yield a curve with a maximum of physical stability at a concentration with unstable compositions at higher and lower concentrations. Typically, mixtures of solvents and surfactants (e.g., acetic acid and surfactant) do not form microemulsions.<br>
In an embodiment, the composition including surfactant solubilizer takes the form of a viscoelastic gel or liquid. Increasing the concentration of the medium chain carboxylic acid, medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, or mixture thereof can increase the degree to which the composition is a viscoelastic gel or liquid. Increasing the concentration of the surfactant solubilizer can increase the degree to which the composition is a viscoelastic gel or liquid. In an embodiment, the gel can be sufficiently viscoelastic to hold its molded shape. Alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant (e.g., LAS) can be employed to form a viscoelastic gel or liquid that can hold its molded shape. In an embodiment, the alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant containing viscoelastic gel can hold its shape even at 60 °C.<br>
Although not limiting to the present invention, the present compositions may include medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid sequestered in the surfactant of the microemulsion. This can stabilize the peroxycarboxylic acid by keeping it away from impurities or reducing agents in the bulk water. This can increase the production of peroxycarboxylic acid by pulling it out of solution. Although not limiting to the present invention, it is believed that one explanation for the viscoelastic properties of gels of the present compositions is that they are due to repulsive forces between the dispersions/droplets that are stabilized by the microemulsion-forming surfactant. Surfactants that are charged may increase the electrostatic repulsion. Suitable charged surfactants include anionic surfactants.<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition includes anionic surfactant and another surfactant or surfactants. For example, the present compositions can include anionic surfactant and nonionic surfactant or semi-polar nonionic surfactant.<br>
In an embodiment, the present composition includes medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid; medium chain carboxylic acid; carrier; and one or more (e.g., at least one) surfactants, e.g., microemulsion forming surfactants. For example, the<br>

Such compositions can be advantageous for applications such as clean in place, machine warewashing, destaining, and sanitizing, laundry washing, destaining, and sanitizing, etc.<br>
For applications in which foaming is desirable, a foaming agent can be added as part of the present composition or separately. In a two-step offering, a foaming agent can be combined with a dilution of the non-foam or low foam composition to form a foaming use solution. In a one-step offering, the foaming agent can be incorporated into the concentrated composition. One suitable foaming agent is LAS acid. LAS acid can form a microemulsion in the present compositions. LAS acid can form a viscoelastic gel or liquid in the present compositions. Additional suitable foaming agents include secondary alkane sulfonate, alkylated diphenyl oxide disulfonate (e.g., C12 alkyl diphenyl oxide disulfonate), alkyl ether sulfate (e.g., with n=l-3) (e.g., sodium laureth sulfate (with n=l, 2, or 3)), sodium lauryl sulfate, or the like.<br>
In an embodiment, such foaming agents provide a foaming composition with one or more desirable foaming characteristics. Desirable foaming characteristics include, for example, foam being visible for about 5 min after forming the foam; foam with continuous and good drainage (e.g., when applied to a vertical surface); foam that dries to a clear appearance, e.g., that leaves no visible residue on a stainless steel surface; and/or foam that can be applied with a moderate or low odor compared to a conventional foam containing peroxyacetic acid.<br>

Secondary carboxylates useful in the present compositions include those which contain a carboxyl unit connected to a secondary carbon. The secondary carbon can be in a ring structure, e.g. as in p-octyl benzoic acid, or as in alkyl-substituted cyclohexyl carboxylates. The secondary carboxylate surfactants typically contain no ether linkages, no ester linkages and no hydroxyl groups. Further, they typically lack nitrogen atoms in the head-group (amphiphilic portion). Suitable secondary soap surfactants typically contain 11-13 total carbon atoms, although more carbons atoms (e.g., up to 16) can be present. Suitable carboxylates also include acylamino acids (and salts), such as acylgluamates, acyl peptides, sarcosinates (e.g. N-acyl sarcosinates), taurates (e.g. N-acyl taurates and fatty acid amides of methyl tauride), and the like.<br>

Such alkyl and alkylaryl ethoxy carboxylates are commercially available. These ethoxy carboxylates are typically available as the acid forms, which can be readily converted to the anionic or salt form. Commercially available carboxylates include, Neodox 23-4, a C12.13 alkyl polyethoxy (4) earboxylic acid (Shell Chemical), and Emcol CNP-110, a C9 alkylaryl polyethoxy (10) earboxylic acid (Witco Chemical). Carboxylates are also available from Clariant, e.g. the product Sandopan® DTC, a C13 alkyl polyethoxy (7) earboxylic acid.<br>
Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
Amphoteric, or ampholytic, surfactants contain both a basic and an acidic hydrophilic group and an organic hydrophobic group. These ionic entities may be any of anionic or cationic groups described herein for other types of surfactants. A basic nitrogen and an acidic carboxylate group are the typical functional groups employed as the basic and acidic hydrophilic groups. In a few surfactants, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate or phosphate provide the negative charge.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic secondary and tertiary amines, in which the aliphatic radical may be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfo, sulfato, phosphate, or phosphono. Amphoteric surfactants are subdivided into two major classes known to those of skill in the art and described in "Surfactant Encyclopedia" Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries. Vol. 104 (2) 69-71 (1989). The first class includes acyl/dialkyl ethylenediamine derivatives (e.g. 2-alkyl hydroxyethyl imidazoline derivatives) and their salts. The second class includes N-alkylamino acids and their salts. Some amphoteric surfactants can be envisioned as fitting into both classes.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants can be synthesized by methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, 2-alkyl hydroxyethyl imidazoline is synthesized by condensation and ring closure of a long chain earboxylic acid (or a derivative) with dialkyl ethylenediamine. Commercial amphoteric surfactants are derivatized by subsequent hydrolysis and ring-opening of the imidazoline ring by alkylation — for example with chloroacetic acid or ethyl acetate. During alkylation, one or two<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/U00147<br>
carboxy-alkyl groups react to form a tertiary amine and an ether linkage with differing alkylating agents yielding different tertiary amines.<br>
Long chain imidazoline derivatives having application in the present invention generally have the general formula:<br><br>
wherein R is an acyclic hydrophobic group containing from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and M is a cation to neutralize the charge of the anion, generally sodium. Commercially prominent imidazoline-derived amphoterics that can be employed in the present compositions include for example: Cocoamphopropionate, Cocoamphocarboxy-propionate, Cocoamphoglycinate, Cocoamphocarboxy-glycinate, Cocoamphopropyl-sulfonate, and Cocoamphocarboxy-propionic acid. Amphocarboxylic acids can be produced from fatty imidazolines in which the dicarboxylic acid functionality of the amphodicarboxylic acid is diacetic acid and/or dipropionic acid.<br>
The carboxymethylated compounds (glycinates) described herein above frequently are called betaines. Betaines are a special class of amphoteric discussed herein below in the section entitled, Zwitterion Surfactants.<br>
Long chain N-alkylamino acids are readily prepared by reaction RNH2, in which R=C8-Cig straight or branched chain alkyl, fatty amines with halogenated carboxylic acids. Alkylation of the primary amino groups of an amino acid leads to secondary and tertiary amines. Alkyl substituents may have additional amino groups that provide more than one reactive nitrogen center. Most commercial N-alkylamine acids are alkyl derivatives of beta-alanine or beta-N(2-carboxyethyl) alanine. Examples of commercial N-alkylamino acid ampholytes having application in this invention include alkyl beta-amino dipropionates, RN(C2H<icoom and rnhc2h4coom. in an embodiment r can be acyclic hydrophobic group></icoom>

containing from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms, and M is a cation to neutralize the charge of the anion.<br>
Suitable amphoteric surfactants include those derived from coconut products such as coconut oil or coconut fatty acid. Additional suitable coconut derived surfactants include as part of their structure an ethylenediamine moiety, an alkanolamide moiety, an amino acid moiety, e.g., glycine, or a combination thereof; and an aliphatic substituent of from about 8 to 18 (e.g., 12) carbon atoms. Such a surfactant can also be considered an alkyl amphodicarboxylic acid. These amphoteric surfactants can include chemical structures represented as: Ci2-alkyl-C(O)-NH-CH2-CH2-N+(CH2-CH2-CO2Na)2-CH2-CH2-OHorCi2-alkyl-C(O)-N(H)-CH2-CH2-N+(CH2-CO2Na)2-CH2-CH2-OH. Disodium cocoampho dipropionate is one suitable amphoteric surfactant and is commercially available under the tradename Miranol™ FBS from Rhodia Inc., Cranbury, N.J. Another suitable coconut derived amphoteric surfactant with the chemical name disodium cocoampho diacetate is sold under the tradename Mirataine™ JCHA, also from Rhodia Inc., Cranbury, N.J.<br>
A typical listing of amphoteric classes, and species of these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678 issued to Laughlin and Heuring on Dec. 30, 1975. Further examples are given in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I and II by Schwartz, Perry and Berch).<br>
Zwitterionic Surfactants<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants can be thought of as a subset of the amphoteric surfactants and can include an anionic charge. Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. Typically, a zwitterionic surfactant includes a positive charged quaternary ammonium or, in some cases, a sulfonium or phosphonium ion; a negative charged carboxyl group; and an alkyl group. Zwitterionics generally contain cationic and anionic groups which ionize to a nearly equal degree in the isoelectric region of the molecule and which can develop strong" inner-salt" attraction between positive-negative charge centers. Examples of such zwitterionic synthetic surfactants include derivatives of aliphatic quaternary<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
ammonium, phosphonium, and sulfonium compounds, in which the aliphatic radicals can be straight chain or branched, and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and one contains an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate. Betaine and sultaine surfactants are exemplary zwitterionic surfactants for use herein. A general formula for these compounds is:<br><br>
wherein Rl contains an alkyl, alkenyl, or hydroxyalkyl radical of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms having from 0 to 10 ethylene oxide moieties and from 0 to 1 glyceryl moiety; Y is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms; R2 is an alkyl or monohydroxy alkyl group containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms; x is 1 when Y is a sulfur atom and 2 when Y is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom, R3 is an alkylene or hydroxy alkylene or hydroxy alkylene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Z is a radical selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate, and phosphate groups.<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br><br>
These surfactant betaines typically do not exhibit strong cationic or anionic characters at pH extremes nor do they show reduced water solubility in their isoelectric range. Unlike "external" quaternary ammonium salts, betaines are compatible with anionics. Examples of suitable betaines include coconut acylamidopropyldimethyl betaine; hexadecyl dimethyl betaine; C12.14 acylamidopropylbetaine; Cg-u acylamidohexyldiethyl betaine; 4-CH-I6 acylmethylamidodiethylammonio-1-carboxybutane; Ci6-u acylamidodimethylbetaine; CIM« acylamidopentanediethylbetaine; and C12-16 acylmethylamidodimethylbetaine.<br>

For example, in an embodiment, the present method includes converting about 30% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method includes converting about 35% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method includes converting about 40% of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention includes a method of using a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition. The method can include contacting an object with the present composition (e.g., a use composition) and can result in reducing the population of one or more microorganisms on the object.<br>
Use Compositions<br>
The present compositions include concentrate compositions and use compositions. For example, a concentrate composition can be diluted, for example with water, to form a use composition. In an embodiment, a concentrate composition can be diluted to a use solution before to application to an object. For reasons of economics, the concentrate can be marketed and an end user can dilute the concentrate with water or an aqueous diluent to a use solution.<br>
The level of active components in the concentrate composition is dependent on the intended dilution factor and the desired activity of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compound. Generally, a dilution of about 1 fluid ounce to about<br>
66<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
20 gallons of water to about 5 fluid ounces to about 1 gallon of water is used for aqueous antimicrobial compositions. Higher use dilutions can be employed if elevated use temperature (greater than 25 °C) or extended exposure time (greater than 30 seconds) can be employed. In the typical use locus, the concentrate is diluted with a major proportion of water using commonly available tap or service water mixing the materials at a dilution ratio of about 3 to about 20 ounces of concentrate per 100 gallons of water.<br>
For example, a use composition can include about 0.01 to about 4 wt-% of a concentrate composition and about 96 to about 99.99 wt-% diluent; about 0.5 to about 4 wt-% of a concentrate composition and about 96 to about 99.5 wt-% diluent; about 0.5, about 1, about 1.5, about 2, about 2.5, about 3, about 3.5, or about 4 wt-% of a concentrate composition; about 0.01 to about 0.1 wt-% of a concentrate composition; or about 0.01, about 0.02, about 0.03, about 0.04, about 0.05, about 0.06, about 0.07, about 0.08, about 0.09, or about 0.1 wt-% of a concentrate composition. Amounts of an ingredient in a use composition can be calculated from the amounts listed above for concentrate compositions and these dilution factors.<br>
The present methods can employ medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid at a concentration effective for reducing the population of one or more microorganisms. Such effective concentrations include about 2 to about 500 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 2 to about 300 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 100 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 60 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 45 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 35 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 25 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 8 to about 50 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 10 to about 500 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 10 to about 50 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 40 to about 140 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 100 to about 250 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, or about 200 to about 300 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. In an embodiment, the use composition can include about 2 to about 500 ppm medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, about 5 to about 2000 ppm medium chain carboxylic acid, about 95 to about 99.99 wt-% carrier and/or diluent<br>
67<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
(e.g., water); and about 2 to about 23,000 ppm polyalkylene oxide, capped polyalkylene oxide, alkoxylated surfactant, anionic surfactant, or mixture thereof.<br>
The level of reactive species, such as peroxycarboxylic acids and/or hydrogen peroxide, in a use composition can be affected, typically diminished, by organic matter that is found in or added to the use composition. For example, when the use composition is a bath or spray used for washing an object, soil on the object can consume peroxy acid and peroxide. Thus, the present amounts of ingredients in the use compositions refeT to the composition before or early in use, with the understanding that the amounts will diminish as organic matter is added to the use composition.<br>
In an embodiment, the present use composition can be made more acidic by passing the concentrate through an acidifying column, or by adding additional acidulant to the use composition.<br>
Other Fluid Compositions<br>
The present and compositions can include a critical, near critical, or supercritical (densified) fluid and an antimicrobial agent or a gaseous composition of an antimicrobial agent. The densified fluid can be a near critical, critical, supercritical fluid, or another type of fluid with properties of a supercritical fluid. Fluids suitable for densification include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ammonia, xenon, krypton, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, certain fluoroalkanes (e.g., chlorotrifluoromethane and monofluoromethane), and the like, or mixtures thereof. Suitable fluids include carbon dioxide.<br>
In an embodiment, the present compositions or methods include densified carbon dioxide, medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid, and medium chain carboxylic acid. Such a composition can be referred to as a densified fluid medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition. In another embodiment, the antimicrobial composition includes the fluid, an antimicrobial agent, and any of the optional or added ingredients, but is in the form of a gas.<br>
Densified fluid antimicrobial compositions can be applied by any of several methods known to those of skill in the art. Such methods include venting at an object a vessel containing densified fluid and antimicrobial agent. The aqueous phase, which includes hydrogen peroxide, is advantageously retained in the device. The vented gas<br>
68<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
includes an effective amount of antimicrobial agent making the densified fluid peroxycarboxylic acid compositions effective antimicrobial agents.<br>
Because of the high pressure nature of the densified fluid compositions of the invention, these compositions are typically applied by venting a vessel containing the composition through a pressure relief device that is designed to promote rapid efficient coverage of an object. Devices including such a pressure relief device include sprayers, foggers, foamers, foam pad applicators, brush applicators or any other device that can permit the expansion of the fluid materials from high pressure to ambient pressure while applying the material to an object. The densified fluid peroxycarboxylic acid composition can also be applied to an object by any of a variety of methods known for applying gaseous agents to an object.<br>
Densified fluid antimicrobial compositions can be made by reacting an oxidizable substrate with an oxidizing agent in a medium comprising a densified fluid to form an antimicrobial composition. This reaction is typically carried out in a vessel suitable for containing a densified fluid. Reacting can include adding to the vessel the oxidizable substrate and the oxidizing agent, and adding fluid to the vessel to form the densified fluid. In an embodiment, the reaction is between a medium chain carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide to form the corresponding peroxycarboxylic acid. The hydrogen peroxide is commonly supplied in the form of an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Supercritical, subcritical, near supercritical, and other dense fluids and solvents that can be employed with such fluids are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,306,350, issued April 26, 1994 to Hoy et al, which is incorporated by reference herein for such disclosure. Supercritical and other dense forms of carbon dioxide, and cosolvents, co-surfactants, and other additives that can be employed with these forms of carbon dioxide are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,866,005, issued February 2, 1999 to DeSimone et al., which is incorporated by reference herein for such disclosure.<br>
Making Medium Chain Peroxvcarboxylic Acid Compositions<br>
The compositions of or used in the methods of the invention can be made by combining or reacting the medium chain carboxylic acid and the oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide. Combining or reacting medium chain carboxylic acid and oxidizing<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
agent results in production of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. In an embodiment, combining includes mixing. The formulation combined for making the present compositions can also include the solubilizer, the acidulant, the carrier, stabilizing agent, mixtures thereof, or the like. In an embodiment, the formulation includes solubilizer. Alternatively, one or more (e.g., at least one) of the solubilizer, the acidulant, the carrier, or mixtures thereof, can be added after production of some or all of the peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention includes a method of making a medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. The method can include combining or reacting medium chain carboxylic acid, carrier (e.g., water), oxidizing agent (e.g., hydrogen peroxide), solubilizer, acidulant, and stabilizing agent. The method can include mixing the ingredients at concentrations of about 1 to about 10 wt-% medium chain carboxylic acid, about 0 to about 98 wt-% carrier, about 2 to about 30 wt-% oxidizing agent, about 1 to about 80 wt-% solubilizer, about 1 to about 50 wt-% acidulant, and about 0.5 to about 50 wt-% stabilizing agent. The method can include mixing the ingredients at concentrations about 1 to about 10 vrt-% medium chain carboxylic acid, about 5 to about 97 wt-% carrier, about 2 to about 30 wt-% oxidizing agent, about 1 to about 20 wt-% solubilizer (e.g., microemulsion forming surfactant), about 1 to about 50 wt-% acidulant, and about 0.5 to about 50 wt-% stabilizing agent. The present compositions also include compositions in which these combinations of ingredients have come to equilibrium forming medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
In an embodiment, the present method produces advantageously high levels of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in advantageously short times. Advantageously short times include, for example, about 24 or fewer hours, about 6 or fewer hours, about 3 or fewer hours, or about 0.5 hr. In an embodiment, high levels of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid can be achieved nearly instantaneously. High levels of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid be achieved by converting 20% or more, 25% or more, 30% or more, 35% or more, or 40% of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. Such conversions can be achieved at room temperature or in a reaction started at room temperature and warmed by an exotherm. Lower temperatures can require a longer time to reach the same amount of conversion.<br>
70<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
The amount of time is typically measured from the time that the carboxylic acid, oxidizing agent, solubilizer, and acidulant are combined or reacted.<br>
For example, in an embodiment, the present method can convert 20% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method can convert about 25% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method can convert about 30% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method can convert about 35% or more of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours. For example, in an embodiment, the present method can convert about 40% of the medium chain carboxylic acid to medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid in about 24 or fewer hours.<br>
In an embodiment, making the present compositions includes forming a microemulsion. A microemulsion can be formed by mixing the desired ingredients including a microemulsion forming surfactant. The method can include combining or mixing the ingredients at concentration of about 1 to about 10 wt-% medium chain carboxylic acid, about 5 to about 97 wt-% carrier (e.g., water), about 2 to about 30 wt-% oxidizing agent, about 1 to about 20 wt-% microemulsion forming surfactant, and about 1 to about 50 wt-% stabilizer. The present compositions also include compositions in which these combinations of ingredients have come to equilibrium forming medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. The components can be added in any of a variety of orders. In an embodiment, formation of the medium chain peroxy carboxylic acid can proceed rapidly after the addition of the microemulsion forming surfactant. Although not limiting to the present invention, it is believed that the formation of the microemulsion can significantly increase the effective surface area of the medium chain carboxylic acid (as micro-droplets) for reaction.<br>
The present compositions can be made in a plant as a concentrate and shipped to an end user who need only dilute the concentrate to form a use composition. The present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions can also be made at the site of use. For example, the product can be shipped as a two or more part composition or<br>
71<br><br>
WO 2005/067741<br><br>
PCT/US2005/000147<br><br>
as a kit. The user can then combine the two or more compositions or components of the kit to produce the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions. Alternatively, a system of formulating equipment and containers of raw materials can be provided at the site of use, and programmed or operated to mix and disperse the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions.<br>
In an embodiment, the product can be supplied as a two or more part composition. One composition can include carboxylic acid and one or more (e.g., at least one) of solubilizer, acidulant, carrier, stabilizing agent, mixtures thereof, or the like. The second composition can include oxidizing agent and one or more (e.g., at least one) of solubilizer, acidulant, carrier, stabilizing agent mixtures thereof, or the like. Alternatively, the solubilizer, acidulant, carrier, stabilizing agent mixtures thereof, or the like can be supplied as additional composition(s).<br>
In an embodiment, the pH of a concentrate composition can be less than about 1 or about 2. In an embodiment, the pH of a 1 % or 1.5% solution of the mixture in water is about 1 or 2 to about 7, depending on the other components of the 1% solution. In an embodiment, the pH of a use composition can be from about 2 to about 7 depending on the other components.<br>
Some examples of representative concentrations of ingredients useful in the present methods of making medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions can be found in Tables G and H, in which the values are given in wt-% of the ingredients in reference to the total composition weight. In certain embodiments, the proportions and amounts in Tables G-H can be modified by "about".

Barlox 12 (1 wt-%). In compositions PP, QQ, RR, and SS, the solubilizer was LAS-acid. In composition TT, the solubilizer was disodium cocoampho dipropionate (supplied under the tradename Miranol® FBS, which includes 39% solids). In composition UU, the solubilizer was an aminoproprionate betaine (supplied under the tradename Mirataine® JC-HA, which includes 42% solids). In composition VV, the solubilizer C12-13 alcohol 4 mole EO carboxylic acid (supplied under the tradename Neodox 23-4, which includes 90% active).<br>
The quantities of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid were determined in compositions PP, QQ, RR, and SS after 7.5 days at 60 °C.<br>

In each of compositions WW, XX, YY, ZZ, and BA: the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid was peroxyoctanoic acid; the medium chain carboxylic acid was octanoic acid; the carrier was water; the oxidizing agent was hydrogen peroxide (supplied as 35% hydrogen peroxide in water); the stabilizing agent was HEDP (supplied as Dequest 2010, which includes 60 wt-% HEDP); and the solubilizer was NAS-FAL.<br>
The acidulant was varied among these compositions. In composition WW, the acidulant was hydroxyacetic acid (supplied as 75% hydroxyacetic acid) (19 wt-%) and sulfuric acid (reagent grade, 98%) (5 wt-%). In composition XX, the acidulant was hydroxyacetic acid (supplied as 75% hydroxyacetic acid) (19 wt-%) and methane<br>

sulfonic acid (99.5 % + Aldrich) (5 wt-%). In composition YY, the acidulant was hydroxyacetic acid (supplied as 75% hydroxyacetic acid). In composition ZZ, the acidulant was purified hydroxyacetic acid. In composition BA, the acidulant was hydroxypropionic acid (supplied as 22% 3-hydroxypropionic acid).<br>
In these compositions the hydroxycarboxylic acids contributed virtually no solubilization of the medium chain carboxylic acid. The compositions required solubilizer.<br>

When a high level of sulfuric acid was used as the acidulant (Examples include B, E, O, and Q), a strong exotherm was obtained, and the medium chain peroxy carboxylic acid was generated rapidly, for example, virtually instantaneously. For some of these compositions, the sulfuric acid needed to be added slowly and with cooling to keep the temperature below 170 °F or below 120 CF. Such formulas that can generate medium chain peroxy carboxylic acids, rapidly or almost instantaneously can be employed for on site generation at the use location.<br>
The concentrations of peroxyoctanoic acid reported in the present examples were determined by a well established and standardized titration protocol. First, hydrogen peroxide content was determined by an oxidation-reduction titration with<br>
82<br><br>
WO 2005/06774:	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
eerie sulfate. After the endpoint of this titration was reached, an excess of potassium iodide was added to the solution. The potassium iodide reacts with peroxycarhoxylic acids to liberate iodine. The liberated iodine was titrated with a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate to yield the concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid. The remaining level of carboxylic acid can be calculated.<br>
The octanoic acid employed in the present examples was obtained from sources including Procter &amp; Gamble Chemicals and includes a minimum of 95% octanoic acid with minor amounts of hexanoic acid (ca. 2%), decanoic acid (ca. 2%), and dodecanoic acid (
Example 2 - - Stability of Compositions Including Medium Chain Peroxyearboxylic Acid and Solubilizer<br>
Compositions according to the present invention were evaluated and demonstrated physical stability and advantageous stability of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Several of the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions were evaluated for stability of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. A sealed container including the composition was placed in an oven at an elevated temperature or was left at room temperature for a period of time. The temperatures and times are reported in the tables below. One week at 60 °C can be considered equivalent to a year at room temperature (RT). The quantity of peroxycarboxylic acid was determined by titration.<br>
Several of the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions were also evaluated for physical stability. The sample were visually inspected at intervals at which peroxycarboxylic acid level was also determined.<br>
Results<br>
The results obtained for determinations of stability of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid and of physical stability are reported below in Tables 7 and 8.<br>
The results presented in Table 7 for compositions M and N indicate that stability of the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid decreases when phosphoric acid<br>
83<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US200S/000147<br>
increases from 25 % to 35%. This suggests that the compositions including solvent solubilizer are susceptible to degradation caused by impurities present in the technical grade phosphoric acid.<br>
The results presented in Table 8, specifically the blue tyndall appearance, indicates that each of these compositions was in the form of a microemulsion.<br>
A study of accelerated aging of a mixed peroxycarboxylic acid composition demonstrated that peroxyoctanoic acid in a mixed peracid composition underwent significant degradation at 60 °C in 7 days. After 7 days, three samples underwent 20, 23, and 54 % degradation.<br>
The microemulsion compositions were less susceptible to degradation by impurities. For example, compositions KK and LL included technical grade phosphoric acid and exhibited good stability. In contrast, if phosphoric acid is to be used in conventional formulations of peroxycarboxylic acids, high purity grade is required to avoid unacceptable degradation.<br>
Compositions A, B, C, D, and E were two phase compositions.<br>

Example 3 - - Shear Thinning Viscosity of Compositions Including Medium Chain Peroxycarboxvlic Acid and Solubilizer<br>
Compositions according to the present invention were evaluated and demonstrated to have advantageous shear thinning viscosity, which is characteristic of microemulsions.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Several of the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions were evaluated for viscosity as a function of rate of spindle rotation using an LVT viscometer and an N2 spindle. The temperature of the compositions was room temperature (about 75 °F).<br>
Results<br>
The results obtained for determinations of viscosity of the present compositions are reported below in Table 7. Decreasing viscosity with increasing spindle rotation rate indicates shear thinning, which is characteristic of a microemulsion. Each of the compositions tested showed shear thinning viscosity.<br>

Example 4 - ¦ Antimicrobial Efficacy of the Present Compositions Including Medium Chain Peroxvcarboxvlic Acid and Solubilizer<br>
Compositions according to the present invention were evaluated and demonstrated advantageous antimicrobial activity against microbes such as gram negative bacteria, gram positive bacteria, fungi, spores, viruses, and mycobacteria.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Antimicrobial activity was determined according to two well established methods. The first method was the procedure set out in Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizing Action of Disinfectants, Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, paragraph 960.09 and applicable sections, 15th Edition, 1990 (EPA Guideline 91-2). The second method was the procedure described in A.O.A.C. Use Dilution Methods, Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists, paragraph 955.14 and applicable sections, 15th Edition, 1990 (EPA Guideline 91-2). Briefly, antimicrobial activity of the present compositions<br>
88<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
was determined by exposing a one mL aliquot containing the target microorganism to 99 mL of the desired concentration of the test substance at the desired temperature. After the specified contact time, one mL of the test solution containing the microorganism was neutralized and enumerated for survivors.<br>
The hospital disinfectant efficacy of the present compositions was determined by drying the target microorganism on a stainless steel carrier and exposing the carrier to 10 mL of the desired concentration of test composition at the desired temperature for the specified contact time. Then, the carrier was aseptically transferred to a neutralizer/subculture medium.<br>
Antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 was determined by known procedures. Briefly: Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 was dried on a glass surface. The film of virus was exposed to test substance for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the mixture of film and test substance were subjected to gel filtration to separate small molecules from virus particles. The recovered virus was assayed for infectivity by an accepted assay method.<br>
Antiviral activity against Poliovirus Type 1 was determined by known procedures. Briefly: Poliovirus Type 1 was dried on a glass surface. The film of virus was exposed to test substance for 5 min at room temperature. Then, the mixture of film and test substance were subjected to gel filtration to separate small molecules from virus particles. The recovered virus was assayed for infectivity by an accepted assay method.<br>
Results<br>
Tables 12-21 include data showing that the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions had antimicrobial activity when tested against bacteria, fungi, and spores in several different types of tests.<br>
The data presented in Table 12 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity when diluted with a diluent to pH less than 4. Efficacy was not as great if the composition was diluted and then the pH was brought to less than or equal to 4. These results illustrate that present compositions with significant levels of acidulant exhibited, under certain circumstances, advantageous activity.<br>
89<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
The data presented in Table 13 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity at pH of 2.6 to 3.5. These results indicate that at a pH of 6.1, 11 ppm of peroxyoctanoic acid (POOA) is still effective at reducing S. aureus by &gt;7.04 log. The data presented in Table 14 demonstrate that efficacy of this composition was not as great against E. coli if it was diluted and then the pH was brought to less than 4.<br>
The data presented in Table 15 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity. All formulas tested achieved &gt;5 log reductions of Escherichia coli in 30 seconds at 0.069% when diluted in 500 ppm synthetic hard water. Also, these compositions achieved complete kill (&gt;7 log reduction) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 30 seconds at 0.082% when diluted in 500 ppm synthetic hard water. The combination of higher pH and lower ppm in one composition may have contributed to the lower log reduction.<br>
The data presented in Table 16 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against several fungi and bacteria. The present compositions exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi at low levels of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid. These results indicate that composition 106 is more effective that composition DD. Composition BB achieved higher reductions of A. niger and P. aeruginosa at similar levels of peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
The data presented in Table 17 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against several fungi and several bacteria.<br>
The data presented in Table 18 demonstrate that one of the present compositions (KK) exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7, S. typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes. This composition achieved more than 99.999% reduction within a 30 second exposure time.<br>
The data presented in Table 19 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against several bacteria in a hospital disinfectant test. The hospital disinfectant test measures whether the composition killed all of the microbes on a stainless steel carrier. A composition listed as 10/10 killed all of the bacteria on each of 10 carriers. Likewise a result of 60/60 indicates that a composition kills all of the bacteria on each of 60 carriers. These results present a<br>
90<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
greater challenge for an antimicrobial agent because it requires activity in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. Therefore, it indicates that the present compositions were effective as a hospital disinfectant in the presence of blood soil.<br>
The data presented in Table 20 demonstrate that one of the present compositions exhibited superior antimicrobial activity against several bacteria in a hospital disinfectant test compared to a conventional, commercially available antimicrobial agent. The hospital disinfectant test measures whether the composition killed all of the microbes on a particular carrier. The composition according to the present invention, AA-O, passed the hospital disinfectant test, with complete kill on 59 of 60 carriers. The conventional antimicrobial agent (containing hydrogen peroxide as active) did not pass the test. It yielded complete kill on only 58 of 60 carriers. These results indicate that in the presence of fetal bovine serum and when diluted in synthetic hard water the current composition was more effective than the commercially available hospital disinfectant.<br>
The data presented in Table 21 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against bacterial spores. Bacterial spores are difficult to kill. These results indicate that at elevated temperatures the effectiveness of the present compositions increased, which provided for effective kill at reduced contact times.<br>
The data presented in Table 22 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited superior antimicrobial activity against bacterial spores compared to conventional peroxide and peroxycarboxylic acid antimicrobials. The present composition resulted in greater kill at equal or lower concentrations of antimicrobial active. These results indicate that the present compositions exhibited superior antimicrobial activity compared to conventional antimicrobials.<br>
The data presented in Table 23 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited effective antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium bovis. The present composition (B) provided complete kill of M. bovis BCG at dilutions of 1 oz per 4 gal and 1 oz per 6 gal with exposure times as short as 6 min. These results indicate that the compositions of the present invention can be employed as a tuberculocidal agent.<br>
Tests against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 resulted in complete kill of this virus. The virus was dried onto a hard surface. The virus on the hard surface was<br>
91<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US200S/000147<br>
contacted for 10 min with composition B diluted at 1 oz per 6 gallons or 1 oz per 8 gallons. Both dilutions resulted in complete kill, a greater than 5.3 log reduction in virus. Virus and cells survived in appropriate controls. These results indicate that the present compositions are effective virucides.<br>
Tests against Poliovirus Type 1 resulted in nearly complete kill of this virus. The virus was dried onto a hard surface. The virus on the hard surface was contacted for 10 min with composition LL diluted at 1 oz per 1 gallon or 1 oz per 0.5 gallons. The dilution of 1 oz to 1 gallon completely killed the poliovirus at 5 different titers, killed no virus at the highest titer, and resulted in incomplete kill at the second and third highest titers. This dilution exhibited 1.5 log reduction in virus titer. The dilution of 1 oz to 0.5 gallons completely killed poliovirus at all titers tested. This dilution resulted in &gt;4 log reduction in virus titer. Virus and cells survived in appropriate controls. These results indicate that the present compositions are effective general virucides.<br>
The data presented in Table 24 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited antimicrobial activity superior to that of compositions including synthetic medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid that had been added to a composition. Better efficacy was found in the solutions with the lower pH, which were made up with Million water. The 60 ppm sample almost achieved a 5 log reduction in 30 seconds. However, this data indicates that the pH of the test solution can be more important than the ppm of active POOA.<br>
The data presented in Table 25 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited antimicrobial activity superior to that of compositions including synthetic medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid that had been added to a composition. These data further suggest that POOA exhibited greater activity against Escherichia coli a pH of ~4.0 and a concentration &gt;5 ppm no matter what diluent is used. Against Staphylococcus aureus POOA achieved 5 log reductions at a concentration of 5 ppm and at a pH of ~5. There was no difference between the reductions seen in Milli-Q water and soft water for either organism.<br>

peroxycarboxylic acid was peroxyoctanoic acid and peroxynonanoic acid and the medium chain carboxylic acid was octanoic acid and nonanoic acid; nonanoic acid (as isononanoic acid (which is believed to be a 6 carbon main chain with three pendant methyl groups)) was present at 0.5, 1, 0.1,0.2, and 0.3 wt-% for AS-AW, respectively.<br>
In each of compositions AX-AZ and BC-BF: the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid was peroxyoctanoic acid; the medium chain carboxylic acid was octanoic acid; the carrier was water; the oxidizing agent was hydrogen peroxide (supplied from a 35% solution); the stabilizing agent was HEDP (supplied as Dequest 2010 which includes 60 wt-% HEDP); and the acidulant was phosphoric acid (supplied as 75% phosphoric acid).<br>
The solubilizer was varied among these compositions. In composition AX, the solubilizer was LAS acid plus sodium lauryl sulfate. In composition AY, the solubilizer was LAS acid plus sodium lauryl sulfate and C8 dimethyl amine. In compositions AZ and BC-BF, the solubilizer was secondary alkane sulfonate (a mixture of sulfonated paraffins sold under the tradename Hostapur SAS).<br>
In each of compositions BG-BK: the medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid was peroxyoctanoic acid; the medium chain carboxylic acid was octanoic acid; the carrier was water; the oxidizing agent was hydrogen peroxide (supplied from a 35% solution); the stabilizing agent was HEDP (supplied as Dequest 2010 which includes 60 wt-% HEDP); the solubilizer was secondary alkane sulfonate (a mixture of sulfonated<br>

WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
paraffins sold under the tradename Hostapur S AS) plus NAS-FAL; and the acidulant was sulfuric acid.<br>
The compositions that included LAS, secondary alkane sulfonate, alkylated diphenyl oxide disulfonate, or sodium lauryl sulfate as solubilizer were foaming compositions. Specifically, compositions AB and AC are foaming compositions<br>
Most of the compositions were phase stable. In particular: Compositions AX and AY were determined to be phase stable at 60 °C. For example, several of the compositions for which the wt-% of medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid was not determined (nd) were not phase stable. That is, they separated into more than one phase after a predetermined time at one or more (e.g., at least one) of 40 °F, room temperature, 100 °F, or 140 °F (60 °C).<br>
The concentrations of peroxyoctanoic acid reported in the present examples were determined by a well established and standardized titration protocol. First, hydrogen peroxide content was determined by an oxidation-reduction titration with potassium permanganate. After the endpoint of this titration was reached, an excess of potassium iodide was added to the solution. The potassium iodide reacts with peroxycarboxylic acids to liberate iodine. The liberated iodine was titrated with a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate to yield the concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid. The remaining level of carboxylic acid can be (and was) calculated.<br>
The peroxycarboxylic acid was titrated at a time after formulation that was practical in the laboratory. For example, the peroxycarboxylic acid was titrated for compositions AB, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AK, AL, AO, AP, AQ, AU, AV, AZ, BC, and BD after the sample had sat at room temperature for 0, 2 (BD), or 3 (AP, AU, and AV) days. For example, the peroxycarboxylic acid was titrated for compositions AC and BG-BK after the sample had sat at 100 °F for 4 days (AC) or 7 days (BG-BK). For example, the peroxycarboxylic acid was titrated for compositions AI, AN, AR, BE and BF after the sample had sat at 140 °F (60 °C) for I day (AI, AR, and BE) or 4 days (AN and BF).<br>
For composition AB, no decomposition of peroxycarboxylic acid was observed upon aging the composition for 7 days at 140 °F (60 °C). For composition AC, no decomposition of peroxycarboxylic acid was observed upon aging the composition for<br>
106<br><br>
WO 2005/067741	PCT/US2005/000147<br>
34 days at 100 °F. Other compositions were also observed to include stable peroxycarboxylic acid.<br>
The octanoic acid employed in the present examples was obtained from sources including Procter &amp; Gamble Chemicals and includes a minimum of 95% octanoic acid with minor amounts of hexanoic acid (ca. 2%), decanoic acid (ca. 2%), and dodecanoic acid (
Fragrance<br>
Certain of the compositions were evaluated for phase stability and for smell after addition of a fragrance. In particular, compositions AB and AG were evaluated. Fragrances evaluated included Green Meadow (Klabin); Vinegar Mask I (J&amp;E Sozio); Vinegar Mask II (J&amp;E Sozio); amyl acetate; iso-bornyl acetate; and methyl salicylate.<br>
Composition AC included fragrance (1 wt-%), specifically a mint apple fragrance which is believed to be or include an alkyl salicylate. Composition AC altered to include 10 wt-% LAS remained single phase at 40 °F, room temperature, and 70 °F.<br>
Foaming<br>
The results in Table 27 show that the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid composition produced foam with desirable qualities. This study employed a "FOAM IT" brand tank foamer set to produce slightly wet foam, 2 turns from the mid point. The foam was dispensed from use composition at 95-98 °F. The foam was sprayed on a vertical stainless steel surface (approximately 15 ft by 15 ft) from a distance of about 10 ft. The results of Table 27 demonstrate that the present compositions provided foam with desirable hang time and density. Each of the compositions tested at 1 oz/ 6 gal. provided foam with desirable characteristics, such as the breaking foam was visible for about 5 min, the foam drained well from the vertical surface, exhibited good sheeting down vertical surface, and dried evenly to no visible residue.<br>

Materials and Methods<br>
Antimicrobial activity was determined as described above in Example 4.<br>
Results<br>
Tables 28-29 include data showing that the present medium chain peroxycarboxylic acid compositions had antimicrobial activity when tested against bacteria, fungi, and spores in several different types of tests.<br>
The data presented in Table 28 demonstrate that the present compositions exhibited significant antimicrobial activity. Test 1 included 5 min exposure of the microbe to composition AB at room temperature. The microbes in test 1 included E. aerogenes ATCC 13048 and S. aureus ATCC 6538. Test 2 included 30 sec exposure of the microbe to composition AB at room temperature. The microbes in test 2 included S. aureus ATCC 6538, E. co/i ATCC 11229, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 13442.<br>
The data presented in Table 29 demonstrate sporicidal activity of a composition according to the present invention.<br>
Tests against Poliovirus Type 1 resulted in complete kill of this virus. The virus was dried onto a hard surface. The virus on the hard surface was contacted for 10 min with composition AG diluted at 1 oz per 1 gallon or 1 oz per 0.5 gallons. Composition AG demonstrated complete inactivation of Poliovirus type 1 following either 3 min or 5 min exposure at 20 °C. The composition produced &gt;6 and &gt;5.3 log reduction in 3 and 5 min, respectively. Virus and cells survived in appropriate controls. These results indicate that the present compositions are effective general virucides.<br>
The compositions that included fragrance showed no negative effect on antimicrobial efficacy from the fragrance. Several additional compositions were tested for antimicrobial activity and exhibited results similar to those reported in this Example.<br>
