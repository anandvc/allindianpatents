This invention relates to novel substituted phenylacetylenes, more particularly to novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes. The novel phenylacetylenes of the present invention are useful for the preparation of novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives, which are in turn useful for the preparation of room temperature discotic namatic liquid crystals. This invention also relates to a series of novel intermediates for the preparation of novel phenylacetylenes. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes.<br>
The novel branched-chain hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives may find use as discotic nematic (N^) liquid crystals. Accordingly these compounds can be used as liquid crystalline material for display devices such as, wristwatches, calculators, cash registers, gasoline pumps, electronic test equipment, laptop computers, TV screens and other large area displays. They can also be used as liquid crystal solvents for spectroscopy.<br>
Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have played a vital role in information technology. The current world LCD market runs to billions of dollars and is rapidly growing. The twisted nematic and supertwisted nematic display devices are dominating commercial displays since their invention. The liquid crystal layer in these devices is exclusively the calamitic Quid crystals (composed of rod-shaped molecules). A vast number of calamitic nematic liquid crystals having room temperature mesophases, such as, cyanobiphenyls, phenylpyrimidines, phenylcyclohexanes, Shifts:' bases, etc., have been synthesised and used in practical displays.<br>
The major disadvantage with these type of devices is the narrow and non-uniform viewing cone which is considered to be an unacceptable aspect of their performance. We have recently disclosed a novel approach to overcome this problem by utilizing discotic nematic liquid crystals instead of calamitic nematic liquid crystals. This has been made the subject matter of our Indian Patent Application No. 1131/MAS/98 dated 27.5.98 and the corresponding applications for patent filed in<br><br>
Europe bearing EPO no. 98 307996.3 dated 1,10.98, in US bearing no. 09/159,743 dated 24.9.98, in Korea bearing no. 98-55028 dated 15,12.98 and in Japan bearing number 334681/98 dated 25.11.98.<br>
Liquid crystals formed by disc-shaped molecules were discovered in 1977 [S. Chandrasekhar, B.K. Sadashiva, and K.A, Suresh, Pramana, 9, 471, (1977)]. Most raesophases formed by these compounds can be classified basically into two classes; the nematic and the columnar. In the colunmar phases molecules are stacked one on top of the other to form columns, the different columns constituting a two dimensional lattice. The potential uses of these columnar phases as quasi-one-dimensional conductors, photoconductors, light emitting diodes, photovoltaic solar cells, etc., have attracted considerable attention [S, Chandrasekhar, in Hand Book of Liquid Crystals, ed. D. Demus, J. Goodby, G.W. Gray, H,-W, Spiess and V. Vill, Wiley-VCH, 1998, Vol. 2B. Chapter VHI; N. Boden and B. Movaghar, ibid. Chapter DC]<br>
The nematic phase formed by disc-shaped molecules is similar to those of the nematic phase of calamitic molecules. A schematic representation of the discotic nematic phase (N^) (of disc-like molecules) is given below. The director n is representing the preferred axis of orientation of the disc-normals (short molecular axes).<br><br>
Compared to the large number of calamitic molecules showing nematic phase, the number of disk-shaped molecules showing the discotic nematic phase   are rare.<br><br>
Moreover, the N^ phase formed by these materials are high temperature with a narrow thermal range. For any liquid crystal device application, the temperature range of the mesophase and its stability well below and above room temperature are amongst the most important criteria. Hitherto, no room temperature nematic discotic liquid crystal is known. The common procedure for extending the mesophase range of calamitic liquid crystals is by mixing different components and preparing an eutectic mixture but such a procedure has not been applied to discotic neraatics till now. Therefore, it is of great practical interest to prepare room temperature discotic nematic liquid crystals.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore, to provide novel substituted phenylacetylenes of the general formula (1) and their intermediates of the general formula (2), (3) &amp; (4) where R = branched alkyl chain. The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain may range from 4 to 12 , The alkyl chain may preferably be consisting of 1,2 or 3, methyl branch at different positions, for example, 3-methyl octane, 4-methyl octane, 4-methyl nonage, 3, 7-dimethyl octane, 3,7,1 l-triraethyl dodecane, etc.<br><br>
These intermediates are useful for the preparation of hexalakynylbenzene derivatives of the general formula (5)<br><br><br>
where R has the meanings given above.<br>
The compound of the formula (5) and the process for their preparation has been made the subject matter of our copending application no. (A) which is being filed along with this application,<br>
Hexaalkynylbenzenes of the formula (6), where R' = normal alkyl chain a<br>
shown in Table 1, are known to form nematic discotic (N^) phases [B. Kohne, K<br>
Praefcke, Chimia, 41, 196 (1987); M. Ebert, D.A. Jungbauer, R. Kleppinger, J.H.<br>
Wendorff, B. Kohne, K. Praefcke, Liq. Cryst, 4, 53 (1989)]. The thermal behaviour of various reported hexaalkynylbenzenes of the formula (6) is listed below in Table L<br><br><br><br>
Liquid Crystals, ed. D. Demus, J. Goodby, G.W. Gray, H.-W. Spiess and V. Vill, Wiley-VCH, 1998, Vol. 2B, Chapter VII]. No discotic material having stable N^ phase well below and above the ambient temperature is documented.<br>
V<br>
It is evident from the Hterature that when the peripheral alkyl chains are attached to the phenyl ring via an hetero atom such as oxygen or sulphur atom, the melting and clearing temperatures are higher compared to when the alkyl chains are directly attached to the ring, for example, see the above Table 1 entry 3 and 6. When<br>
the heptyl chain is attached to the phenyl ring directly, the melting point is 98*^C and<br>
the clearing point is 13 TC whereas they are 109°C and 193*^C respectively when the<br>
same chain is attached via oxygen atom. It is also well known that when the peripheral aliphatic side chains of various cores are branched, the mesophase is widened but the type of the mesophase formed is not affected by the introduction of branching [P.G. Schouten, J.F. van der Pol, J,W, Zwikker, W, Drenth and SJ. Picken, Mo/. CrysL Liq. Cryst, 1991, 195, 291; D,M. Collard and C.P. Lillya, 7. Anu Chenu Soc, 1991, 113, 8577. P.G. Schouten, J.M, Warman, M.P. deHaas, C. F, van Nostrum, G.H. Gelinck, RJ.M. Nolle, MJ. Copyn, J.W. Zwikker, M.K. Engel, M. Hanack, Y.H. Chang, WX Ford,/ Am, Chenu Soc, 1994,116, 6880],<br>
The main objectives of the present invention is, therefore, to provide novel substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (1) defined above which are useful for the preparation of hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives of the formula (5) useful as discotic nematic (N^) liquid crystals.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (1) defined above and the intermediates which are useful for the preparation of hexalkynylbenzene derivatives of the formula (5) which are in turn useful as discotic nematic (N^) liquid crystals^starting from novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes.<br><br>
The invention is based on our observation that when the normal alkyl chain in the phenyl ring of hexaalkynylbenzene is replaced with branched alkyl chain and connecting it directly to the phenyl ring, the melting points of the alkynylbenzene derivatives may reduce and consequently stabilise the mesophase.<br>
The preparation of the novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (1) defined above according to the present invention is broadly shown in the scheme 1 given below,<br><br>
TTie compounds of the present invention differ from ^the previous known compounds in the following ways; in the known materials either normal (unbranched) alkyl chain is attached directly to the phenyl ring or branched alkyl chain is connected to the phenyl ring via an oxygen atom whereas in our novel compounds, branched alkyl chain is connected directly to the phenyl ring.<br><br>

According to still another embodiment of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of novel 4-(branched alkylphenyl)-2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol of the formula (4) which comprises reacting the substituted broraobenzenes of the formula (3) with 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol to yield the corresponding protected phenylcetylene of the formula (4).<br>
The novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (1) where R has the meanings given above react with hexahalobenzene of the formula (7) wherein X represents bromine or iodine in the presence of a coupling catalyst at a<br>
temperature in the range of 25  to 200°C and recovering the compound by<br>
conventional	methods	to	yield	novel	hexakis(4-(branched<br>

Physical characteristics o f the compound hexakis(4-4-methylnonanylphenylethynyObenzene.<br>
The product hexakis(4-4-methyhionanylphenylethynyl)benzene of the formula (12) isolated in experiment no. 10-14 by column chromatography was found to be<br><br>
homogenous on TLC and the HPLC purity (silica; hexane; flow 1,2, R,T. 39.25 min) was more than 99%. MS data: m/z 1520.2;.*H NMR data: 5 (CDCI3) 7.58<br>
(12H, d), 7.20 (12H, d), 2,64 (12H, t), 1,63-1.1 (78H. m), 0.90 (36H, m), *'C NMR data: 5 (CDCI3) 144,03, 131.79, 128.52, 127,3, 120.53, 99.41, 87.06,<br>
36.95, 36,72, 36.36, 32.66, 32.21, 28.78, 26.72, 22.70. 19.65 and 14.10, Thermal behaviour: The thermal behaviour of the compound hexakis(4-4-mcthylnonanylphenylethynyl)benzene isolated from different batches was checked by polarising microscopy and by differential scanning calorimetry. In all the cases, material shows a room temperature nematic (N^) phase. However, the melting and isotropic temperatures are different. This could be due to the stereohetrogeneity of the product (with one chiral center in each of the six side chains the product derived from racemic starting materials consist of a mixture of various stereoisomers). Variation of stereoisomers in the mixture could be the cause of varying melting and<br>
clearing points in different batches. The melting point was observed in between 0°C<br>
to 10°C and the clearing point in between 40°C to 80°C on heating. Upon cooling<br>
the isotropic liquid, the discotic nematic phase appeared with a very limited supercooling and the material crystallises in between 0°C to - 2 PC.<br>
Advantages  of the   invention.<br>
The novel substituted phenylaceetylenes of the formula (1) of the present invention are important starting materials for the preparation of novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives. The nematic phase shown by these hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives is stable well below and above the ambient temperature and, therefore, very suitable for liquid crystal display (LCD) devices. The liquid crystal display (LCD) device having discotic nematic liquid crystals instead of calamitic nematic liquid crystals has advantages over the conventional LCD devices in that it has a wide and symmetrical viewing angle and no reversal of the contrast ratio in any direction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
