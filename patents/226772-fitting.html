				<td>Title: LOCK ASSEMBLY<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a lock assembly, which comprises a lock fitting and a strike<br>
box fitting. Such assemblies preferably serve for fastening a glass element and/or for<br>
disposing it in a lockable position, at least to one adjoining glass element, the glass<br>
elements being in a rigid or movable position to each other.<br>
Such assemblies, both with and without integral lock or mounted handle device, are<br>
known from the catalogue "DORMA Glasbeschlagstechnik, Edition 09/98" (DORMA<br>
Glass Fitting Technique). Each fitting is composed of fitting-halves. Each fitting-half<br>
has a modular construction and essentially consists of a sub-structure, which is<br>
formed by a base section and by a functional insert, into which, for example, the<br>
proper lock and/or a lever handle mechanism is integrated, and of a capping cover.<br>
Various possibilities are offered for connecting toughened glass elements, both on<br>
the inside area and the outside area.<br>
The opening angle of glass elements, which are movably positioned to each other, is<br>
among other things limited by the shape of the fittings-halves, of the covers thereof<br>
and of the handle devices. Accordingly, the edgy shape of prior art covers presents a<br>
drawback as the edges will prematurely border on each other and reduce the<br>
opening angle. Due to the shape of the edges, the covers require complex<br>
manufacturing and, from the point of view of economical material use, they are not<br>
optimized. Furthermore, particularly during cleaning operations, the cover may cause<br>
injuries to personnel.<br>
Fastening the cover by means of clip-on devices or by means of a snap-in device is<br>
not advantageous. Already during the very first mounting the snap-on devices may<br>
be damaged or may even break. Especially, after disassembling and reassembling it<br>
several times, the cover's tight seating is not any longer guaranteed. If the<br><br>
component is exposed to too much strain, in this case especially with movable door<br>
panels, shocks and vibrations may damage the snap-in device.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a lock assembly, which forms a compact and<br>
visually appealing unit and presents the smallest possible construction height and<br>
dimensions, while maintaining the previously known variety of applications and<br>
different functions. Especially, it should be possible to safely secure the cover of the<br>
fitting halves of the assembly to the underlying sub-structure.<br>
The inventive lock assembly, present the advantage of allowing realization of a small<br>
construction height and a compact unit due to the convex exterior shape of the<br>
elongated cover extending in a direction of an arrow. The edgy exterior shape is<br>
eliminated. Therefore, the sub-structure underneath the cover is rounded, at least at<br>
the corners, such as to create a plane seating support for the cover. The curvature<br>
allows for an optimum exploitation of the construction space and an optimization of<br>
manufacturing expenses and of the material used.<br>
Although the amount of material required for the inventive cover is extremely low, the<br>
stability and functionality characteristics are guaranteed. Especially, the at least<br>
partial plane seating support of the cover at the sub-structure dampens the vibrations<br>
caused during utilization and therefore avoids unintentional removal of the cover.<br>
The resulting exterior contours are conceived in a visually appealing way with<br>
smooth and seamless transitions. All edges and borders are provided with radii. The<br>
result is a universal, model-independent, yet well-balanced exterior line of design. All<br>
material widths are reduced to a minimum. The streamlined shape of the exterior<br>
contours, particularly the frontal surface, considerably reduces the amount of<br>
material required and minimizes, for example, manufacturing problems linked to<br>
casting techniques. Both metal and plastic materials, even so-called hybrid materials<br>
are conceivable for use. Colour composition is almost unlimited. Furthermore, the<br>
enumerated characteristics considerably contribute to reduce the cost of<br>
manufacturing.<br><br>
The concealed disposition of the sub-structure eliminates accidental manipulations<br>
and function-hindering contamination, and creates an advantageous visual<br>
appearance with respect to the glass elements' transparency. Moreover, there are no<br>
protruding components, which make cleaning of the glass surfaces easy.<br>
The lock assembly is suitable for use with both a rigidly fastened glass element, for<br>
example at a stationary glass element, and a pivotably fastened glass element as<br>
adjoining glass elements. The cooperating fittings of the assembly are executed as<br>
complementary parts, such as to visually build one whole.<br>
In the event of a top-side and bottom-side bearing of a movable glass element, the<br>
fitting of the assembly which is fastened at the stationary glass element, due to<br>
stability reasons, is preferably executed in an angular shape, which simultaneously<br>
allows for rigidly interconnecting an over panel and a lateral panel with each other.<br>
The fitting fastened at the movable glass element is of rectangular-shape, such as to<br>
achieve a rectangular unit, when seen as a whole. On account of the advantageous<br>
shape of the cover, the glass elements pivotably connected to each other can be<br>
opened with an opening angle up to almost 180 degrees.<br>
Moreover, a lock may be integral with the lock assembly. The lock assembly is used<br>
for doors, which are supported at a stationary lateral glass panel or at an overpanel,<br>
and depending on the execution type, may be mounted on the top-side or on the<br>
bottom side as a so-called corner lock fitting or as a conventional centrally located<br>
lock fitting. The exterior shape of the lock fitting of the lock assembly, i.e. the<br>
curvature of the frontal surface, is mirrored in the strike box fitting of the lock<br>
assembly. The functional insert includes at least the lock, which is operable by<br>
means of a key, and if necessary, the equipment for mounting a door lever handle. In<br>
the event a non-glass frame is used, an adjustment to the frame construction is<br>
required with respect to the perfect functioning between the movable components<br>
(latch, bolt) in the inventive lock fitting and the associated openings in the strike plate<br><br>
on the frame-side. The cooperating fittings are conceived as complementary parts,<br>
such as to visually build one whole.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a handle device forms an integral part, and, from an<br>
aesthetical and visual point of view, the lock fitting of the assembly and the handle<br>
device form a smooth and harmonized exterior line of design.<br>
The handle device presents the advantage of the handle member having a curved<br>
shape execution, when seen in the direction of a pivotably supported component, for<br>
example a door, which circumstance provides for a reduction of spatial dimension. A<br>
protruding free end of the handle member is eliminated. The curvature allows for<br>
optimum exploitation of the construction space and for optimization of the<br>
manufacturing expense and of the amount of material used.<br>
The construction conveys a distinct feeling of grip to the user. The inwards arched or<br>
curved shape of the handle member creates a haptically advantageous touch<br>
surface, which conveys a distinct feeling of grip to the user and which, particularly in<br>
the event of incompletely embracing the handle member, eliminates slipping of the<br>
hand. Furthermore, the risk of clothes or the like engaging with the handle member is<br>
minimized, as the distance between the free end and the pivoting panel is extremely<br>
small.<br>
The handle device is composed of a handle member, one end thereof is joined by an<br>
integral connecting component serving as a non-positive connection, for example,<br>
with a door. The handle member and the connecting component present a round<br>
cross-section. The diameter of the connecting component preferably increases in the<br>
direction of the pivoting component. On the one hand, this minimizes the amount of<br>
material and, on the other hand, guarantees a sturdy reception of a lever pin, which<br>
mechanically connects the handle device with a locking mechanism and with an<br>
opposite handle device.<br><br>
The free end of the handle member is limited by an oblique, preferably planar fore-<br>
part, the region thereof proximate to the pivoting panel being positioned further away<br>
from the connecting component than the region distal to the panel. The transition<br>
areas between the forepart and the handle member present radii or chamfers.<br>
The handle device is preferably manufactured in a casting process as one piece and<br>
subsequently finished. The smooth transition of the exterior contours reduces<br>
manufacturing problems, for example linked with casting techniques.<br>
The handle device, respectively the individual parts thereof, may be manufactured<br>
from various metals, such as brass, iron, stainless steel, aluminium or bronze, or<br>
from other non-metal materials, such as plastic material.<br>
The inventive handle device can be found in applications with door handles, window<br>
handles or the like, which serve as a simple handle device or trigger functions<br>
associated with locking. Applications associated with locking, for example with door<br>
handles or window handles, are primarily realized by means of a handle device<br>
actuated by rotation, the handle device being coupled with the locking mechanism of<br>
the door or of the window.<br>
To accommodate the fitting's sub-structure, the cover presents in the interior<br>
reception chamber thereof passages on one side, which, being at least friction-fit,<br>
cooperate with blocking bodies that are pre-mounted in the sub-structure and<br>
engage with each other in a complementary manner. Interior grooves will engage<br>
with pins that are resiliently positioned in the sub-structure to realize the cover's final<br>
fastening. The blocking bodies may be formed, for example, as indented pins that<br>
are hammered into boreholes in the sub-structure. In another embodiment the<br>
blocking bodies are formed as headless screws, which may be screwed into<br>
threaded boreholes.<br>
Depending on the execution type, mounting the blocking bodies either requires a<br>
striking tool or a screwdriver. Either the blocking bodies are integrally realized with<br><br>
the sub-structure during manufacturing or they are pre-mounted into the sub-<br>
structure on-site prior to fastening the assembly. This will guarantee that even the<br>
small construction parts are not lost. The blocking bodies build a block against<br>
horizontal loads in the passages, such that it is impossible to fold the cover away. In<br>
the event disassembling should be required, the cover will be displaced, in the spring<br>
relieving vertical direction as far as possible, such that the grooves and the pins can<br>
subsequently be disengaged while folding the cover away by means of small tensile<br>
load. On the opposite side, the connection between the passages and the blocking<br>
bodies can then be separated through simple vertical shifting of the cover. No tools<br>
are required neither for mounting nor for disassembling the cover. This<br>
circumstances eliminates damages to the usual sensitive surfaces of the covers and<br>
to the plate-shaped components.<br>
Invisible from the outside, the connection between the resiliently supported pins and<br>
the grooves is preferably positioned at the side of the assembly oriented towards the<br>
viewer, while the blocking connections are positioned on the far side of the fitting<br>
oriented away from the viewer.<br>

In the following description, similar or similarly functioning construction parts are<br>
referenced with identical numerals, particularly mirror-symmetrical construction parts<br>
presenting identical numerals.<br>
The fittings 1, diagrammatically illustrated in Figures 1 to 8, each consist of mirror-<br>
symmetrical fitting-halves 2 and 3, each fitting half 2 and 3 presents a sub-structure<br>
42 and a cover 4 fastened thereto. The sub-structure 42 can be assembled from a<br>
base section 43 and from a functional insert 44.<br><br>
Such fittings 1 are used, for example, to rigidly or movably connect glass elements in<br>
toughened glass installations. The glass elements present boreholes or cut-outs to<br>
fasten the base sections 43 on both sides, preferably clamp screwed, with an<br>
inserted layer as a glass protection if necessary. The functional inserts 44 are<br>
subsequently fastened to these base sections 43, which inserts allow, for example,<br>
the mobile support or rigid fastening of an adjoining glass element. The fitting<br>
system's modular construction allows for interchangeable utilization of base sections<br>
43, functional inserts 44, and covers 4. The glass elements may present, for<br>
example, a coloured or profiled execution.<br>
In the following, more detailed discussion and illustration of embodiments will be<br>
restricted to the adjacent region to the fittings 1. The sub-structure 42, respectively<br>
the base section 43 thereof and the functional inserts 44 are not illustrated, as they<br>
are each completely invisibly positioned underneath the corresponding cover 4.<br>
Therefore, all functional components are visually advantageously covered.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a first embodiment of an inventive fitting 1. The fitting-<br>
halves 2 and 3 thereof and the covers 4 thereof are illustrated in a mounted condition<br>
in a view on a non-illustrated edge of a glass element. Due to the mirror-symmetry of<br>
the fitting-halves 2 and 3, the following description is valid for both fitting-halves 2<br>
and 3. Each cover 4 presents two horizontally oriented lateral surfaces 5 and 6<br>
having between them a frontal surface 7 extending from a vertical edge 8 towards an<br>
opposite vertical edge 9. The cover 4 presents a rectangular elongated exterior<br>
shape. The frontal surface 7 presents a convex curvature, oriented to the outside,<br>
which, in the drawing, starting at the right edge 9 increases towards the left edge 8.<br>
The right edge 9 has a protruding angled border surface 10 embracing a vertical<br>
edge of the glass element. The border surface 10 is likewise convex shaped towards<br>
the outside. At the left edge 8, due to the increased curvature, the frontal surface 7<br>
extends into an acute angle such as to form a direct glass support in that area.<br>
Adjacent to the glass edge, the lateral surface 5 is partially executed with<br>
prolongations 11 and 12, which cover the glass edge. A recess 13 is provided<br><br>
between the prolongations 11 and 12, through which the components, linking the<br>
functional inserts and having for example the shape of a bearing bolt, pass to be<br>
connected.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a modified embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, having a<br>
shortened border surface 10 formed at the vertical glass edge. Figures 5 and 6<br>
illustrate another embodiment with no prolongations being conformed to the lateral<br>
surface 5. The lateral surface 5 presents a recess 14 such that functional inserts may<br>
cooperate.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate another embodiment suitable for a fitting 1 that rigidly<br>
interconnects an over panel and a lateral panel, at which another glass element is<br>
movably supported. In this case, the construction parts essentially correspond to the<br>
previously described embodiments. Each fitting-half 2 and 3 is formed for stationary<br>
connecting a lateral panel and is additionally provided with an angled extension 15.<br>
The frontal surface 7 is regularly curved from an edge 8 towards an opposite edge 9<br>
and extends into an acute angle on both sides directly on the glass surface. The<br>
lateral surface 5 is likewise provided with prolongations 11 and 12 and a recess 13.<br>
The lock fittings 21 diagrammatically illustrated in Figures 9 to 16 are each<br>
composed of fitting-halves 22 and 23, each fitting-half 22, 23 presenting a sub-<br>
structure 42 and a cover 25 fastened thereto. The sub-structure 42 is assembled<br>
from a base section 43 and from a functional insert 44.<br>
Such lock fittings 21 are used for example with glass elements serving as a door,<br>
which are supported at a fixed lateral glass panel or at an over panel. The<br>
discussions of the embodiment examples in more detail is always limited to one<br>
fitting-half due to identical functionality.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a first embodiment of the lock fitting 21 as a so-called<br>
corner fitting, the lock fitting 21 being mounted at the top and/or bottom corner at the<br>
pivoting side of a non-illustrated glass element. In this case the glass element should<br><br>
present a push pad in the centre of the door and will be locked with respect to its<br>
surroundings by means of locks located in the corner fittings. This lock fitting's 21<br>
covers 25 are illustrated in mounted condition in a view on the non-illustrated edge of<br>
a glass element. The covers 25 are mirror-symmetrically positioned on opposite<br>
sides and each present a rectangular, horizontally elongated exterior shape. Each<br>
cover 25 presents two horizontally oriented lateral surfaces 28 and 29, having a<br>
frontal surface 30 between them extending from an edge 31 to another edge 32. The<br>
frontal surface 30 presents a convex curvature oriented towards the outside, which,<br>
in the drawing, starting at the right edge 31 increases towards the left edge 32. The<br>
right edge 31 has a protruding angled border surface 33 embracing the vertical edge<br>
of the glass element. At the left edge 32, due to the increased curvature, the frontal<br>
surface 30 extends into an acute angle such as to form a direct glass support in that<br>
area. Adjacent to the glass edge, the lateral surface 28 is partially executed with<br>
prolongations 34, 35, 36, which thus cover the glass edge. Recesses 37, 38 are<br>
provided between the prolongations 34, 35, 36, through which the components<br>
provided in the functional inserts vertically pass, having for example the shape of a<br>
locking bolt. The cover 25 presents in the frontal surface 30 thereof an extension 39<br>
covering the non-illustrated lock.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 present a modified embodiment of Figures 9 and 10, such that the<br>
lock fitting 21 can be used in the centre of a door. Therefore no prolongations are<br>
conformed to the lateral surfaces 28 and 29. In this case the locking bolt is<br>
horizontally actuated.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 illustrate an embodiment of the inventive lock fitting 21 as a centre<br>
fitting, the lock fitting 21 being mounted preferably in the centre at the pivoting side of<br>
a glass element. In this case, the lock fitting 21 may present a non-illustrated door<br>
lever handle having a latch and a lock with a dead bolt, which cooperate with<br>
corresponding fittings of a non-illustrated strike plate. The covers 25 of this lock<br>
fitting 21 are illustrated in mounted condition in a view on the non-illustrated vertical<br>
edge of a glass element. The covers 25 each present a rectangular, vertically<br>
elongated exterior shape. Each cover 25 presents two vertically oriented lateral<br><br>
surfaces 28 and 29 having between them a frontal surface 30 extending from a<br>
horizontal edge 31 to a horizontal edge 32 on the opposite side. The frontal surface<br>
30 presents a convex curvature, oriented to the outside, which, in the drawing,<br>
starting at the left edge 31 increases towards the right edge 32. The lower edge 31<br>
has a protruding angled border surface 33 sitting close to the surface of the glass<br>
element. At the upper edge 32, due to the increased curvature, the frontal surface 30<br>
extends into an acute angle such as to form a direct glass support in that area.<br>
Recesses 37 and 38 are provided in the lateral surface 28; through which pass the<br>
components, provided in the functional inserts, having for example the shape of a<br>
latch and a locking bolt. Apertures 40 and 41 are provided in the frontal surface 30<br>
through which the lock can be actuated via a door lever handle. The fitting-half 23 on<br>
the opposite side has the same shape, however with a much flatter design.<br>
Figure 15 and 16 illustrate an embodiment of the inventive lock assembly which<br>
includes a lock fitting 21 executed as a centre fitting in horizontal orientation, the lock<br>
fitting 21 being preferably mounted in the centre at the pivoting side of a glass<br>
element. In this case the lock fitting 21 presents a door lever handle with a latch and<br>
a lock with a dead bolt, which cooperate with corresponding receptions in a strike<br>
box fitting positioned in a lateral panel. The fitting-halves 26 and 27 of the strike box<br>
fitting 24 are likewise illustrated and, in continuing the curved shape of the fitting-<br>
halves 22 and 23 of the lock fitting 21, they form an ergonomic unit. The covers 25<br>
are positioned on opposite sides and each present a rectangular, horizontally<br>
elongated exterior shape. Each cover 25 presents two horizontally oriented lateral<br>
surfaces 28 and 29, having between them a frontal surface 30 extending from a<br>
vertical edge 31 towards an opposite vertical edge 32. The frontal surface 30<br>
presents a convex curvature, oriented to the outside, which, in the drawing, starting<br>
at the left edge 31 increases towards the right edge 32. The left edge 31 has a<br>
protruding angled border surface 33. At the right edge 32, due to the increased<br>
curvature, the frontal surface 30 extends into an acute angle such as to form a direct<br>
glass support in that area. Recesses 37 and 38 are provided in the border surfaces<br>
33 on the frame-side, through which pass the components, provided in the functional<br>
inserts, having for example the shape of a latch and of a dead bolt, pass horizontally.<br><br>
The form of the strike box fitting 24 positioned in the lateral panel subsequently<br>
connects to the border surface 33 of the lock fitting 31 and extends into an acute<br>
angle on the surface of the lateral panel. Thus, the complete fitting builds one whole<br>
and presents a regular curvature over the entire frontal surface 30.<br>
A handle device 58 that can be inserted into the functional unit of a lock fitting 21 is<br>
described in Figures 17 to 22.<br>
The handle device 58 is essentially composed of a handle member 59 and of an<br>
integral connecting component positioned at one end, which realizes the non-positive<br>
connection to a non-illustrated pivoting panel, for example a door, respectively the<br>
fitting thereof. Both the handle member 59 and the connecting component 60 present<br>
a round cross-section. The handle devices 58 are made of stainless steel, of bronze,<br>
of brass or of another metal.<br>
The embodiment example according to Figure 17 illustrates a set of two handle<br>
devices 58, which can be mounted on both sides of a pivoting panel. The handle<br>
devices 58 are identical and can be mounted mirror-symmetrically with respect to<br>
each other. The respective handle member 59 is convex arched over the entire<br>
longitudinal extension and formed in an inclined manner towards the inside. Thus, a<br>
handle shape is achieved, which matches the natural position of the hand, such as to<br>
guarantee an advantageous haptic feeling. The handle member 59 is made without<br>
profile and presents a regular round cross-section.<br>
The free end 61 of the handle member 59 is limited by an oblique, preferably planar<br>
fore-part 62, the region thereof proximate to the pivoting panel being positioned<br>
further away from the connecting component 60 than the region distal to the panel.<br>
The transition areas between the fore-part 62 and the handle member 59 either<br>
present chamfers or radii 63.<br>
The handle member 59 passes in an angle, as one piece and with an angle smaller<br>
than 90 degrees, over into the connecting component 60. The inward inclination of<br>
the handle member 59 is thus achieved. The connecting component 60 is realized<br><br>
without profile and presents a round cross-section. The diameter D of the connecting<br>
component 60 preferably increases, starting at the handle member 59. The lever pin<br>
64 is positioned inside the connecting component 60, pin which mechanically<br>
interconnects the handle device 58 with the closing mechanism and/or an opposite<br>
handle device 58.<br>
The handle devices 58 in Figures 19 to 22 are mounted at lock fittings 21, which are<br>
each composed of fitting-halves 22 and 23, each fitting-half 22, 23 presenting therein<br>
an invisible sub-structure 42 and a cover 25 fastened thereto. The sub-structure 42<br>
may be assembled from a base section 43 and from a functional insert 44.<br>
Figures 19 and 20 illustrate an embodiment of the fitting 21 as a centre fitting 21 as a<br>
centre fitting in horizontal orientation, the fitting 21 being preferably mounted in the<br>
centre of the pivoting side of a glass element. In this case, the inventive handle<br>
device 58, actuating a latch via a closing mechanism that is positioned inside the<br>
fitting 21, is integrated into the fitting 21. The latch cooperates with a corresponding<br>
reception of a non-illustrated strike box fitting positioned at a lateral panel. In<br>
continuing the curved shape of the fitting-halves 22 and 23, the fitting-halves of the<br>
strike box fitting result in an ergonomic whole.<br>
The fitting 21 illustrated in Figures 21 and 22 differs from the fitting 21 illustrated in<br>
Figures 19 and 20 merely in that an additional lock may be inserted into a<br>
corresponding aperture 40. A key, which may be introduced into the lock, actuates,<br>
in this case via the closing mechanism in the fitting 21, a bolt which will engage in a<br>
corresponding reception of the strike box fitting.<br>
With reference being made to Figures 23 to 25, the principal construction of a fitting<br>
1 will be described in more detail. In comparison, the difference in the construction of<br>
a lock fitting 21 consists in the integration of a lock and/or a handle device. The fitting<br>
1 is composed of mirror-symmetrical fitting-halves and 3, each fitting-half 2, 3<br>
presenting a sub-structure 42 and a cover 4 fastened thereto. The sub-structure 42 is<br>
assembled from a base section 43 and from a functional insert 44.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, such fittings 1 serve, for a rigid or movable connection<br>
of toughened glass elements 45 in toughened glass installations. The glass elements<br>
45 present boreholes or apertures for fastening the base sections 43 on both sides,<br>
preferably clamp screwed, with an inserted layer as a glass protection if necessary.<br>
Subsequently, the functional inserts 44 are fastened to these base sections 43,<br>
which allow, for example, movable bearing or rigid fastening a glass element 45. The<br>
fitting system's modular construction allows for interchangeable utilization of base<br>
sections 43, functional inserts 44 and covers 4. The glass elements 45 may present<br>
for example a coloured or profiled execution.<br>
The base section 43 is flat, essentially rectangular-shaped and presents at the upper<br>
side wall 46 thereof, illustrated in Figure 23, two pocket boreholes 47, which are<br>
spaced apart from each other, in vertical orientation, body-inwards, and which body-<br>
outwards are narrowed by means of a reduction 48. In each pocket borehole 47 is<br>
provided a spring 49 which presses a graded pin 50 against the reduction 48, pin<br>
which thus is positioned captive inside the pocket borehole 47. When the spring 49 is<br>
in the rest position, the pin 50 protrudes from the top surface of the longitudinal<br>
surface 46. The lower side wall 51 of base section 43, illustrated in Figure 23,<br>
presents two pocket boreholes 52, which are spaced apart from each other and in<br>
vertical orientation, body-inwards. The boreholes 52 extend axially aligned with the<br>
pocket boreholes 47.<br>
Each cover 4 presents two horizontally oriented lateral surfaces 5 and 6, having<br>
between them a frontal surface 7 extending from a vertical edge 8 towards an<br>
opposite vertical edge 9. The cover 4 presents a rectangular exterior shape. The<br>
frontal surface 7 presents a convex curvature, oriented to the outside, which, starting<br>
at the edge 9 increases towards an edge 8. The edge 9 has a protruding angled<br>
border surface 10 embracing a vertical edge of the glass element 45. At the edge 8,<br>
due to the increased curvature, the frontal surface 7 extends into an acute angle<br>
such as to form a direct glass support in that area. Adjacent to the glass edge, the<br>
lateral surface 6 is executed with a recess 14, through which the components<br>
provided in the functional inserts 44 pass to be connected, having for example the<br><br>
shape of a bearing bolt 53.<br>
Between the frontal surface 7, the lateral surfaces 5 and 6 and the borders 8 and 9, a<br>
reception chamber 54 is formed inside, underneath which the base section 43<br>
completely disappears, once mounting is completed. The lateral surface 5 presents<br>
on the inside two grooves 55, which are spaced apart from each other. The lateral<br>
surface 6 is penetrated by two passages 56 that are spaced apart from each other.<br>
Prior to mounting the sub-structure 42 to the glass element 45, blocking bodies 57 in<br>
the shape of indented pins are friction-fit forced into the boreholes 52. According to a<br>
non-illustrated embodiment, the blocking bodies 57 may be realized integral with the<br>
sub-structure 42 during manufacturing. After subsequent mounting of the sub-<br>
structure 42, the lateral surface 6 of the cover 4 is placed diagonally at the side wall<br>
51 of the base section 43, such that the passages 56 engage positively with the<br>
blocking bodies 57. When the cover 4 is subsequently folded in the direction of the<br>
glass element 45, the sub-structure 42 is completely confined in the reception<br>
chamber 54. In this case, the pins 50 are resiliently pressed back into the respective<br>
pocket boreholes 47. Under the influence of the springs 49 the pins 50 are pressed<br>
into the associated grooves 55 during a corresponding final adjustment of the cover<br>
4. For the time being, the cover 4 is fixed in this position. The described procedures<br>
are to be repeated on both sides of the glass element.<br>
A possible disassembly is done in reverse order. In this case, the cover 4 is<br>
displaced in the spring-relieving vertical direction as far as possible, such that the<br>
grooves 55 and the pins 50 can subsequently disengage, while folding away the<br>
cover 4 by means of small tensile load. On the lateral surface 6 the connection<br>
between the passages 56 and the blocking bodies 57 can be separated simply<br>
through vertical shifting of the cover 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
