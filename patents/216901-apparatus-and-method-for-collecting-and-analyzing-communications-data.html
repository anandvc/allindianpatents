				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR COLLECTING AND ANALYZING<br>
COMMUNICATIONS DATA<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 from<br>
U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/109,718, filed November 24,<br>
1998,which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to data communications, and, in<br>
particular, to a system and related method for collecting, analyzing, and monitoring data<br>
communications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is now routine for data and other information to be communicated to<br>
different points via a communications or data network. One example of such data<br>
networks includes multiple end-user computers which communicate with each other along<br>
the various paths comprising such networks. The complexity of such computer networks<br>
can range from simple peer-to-peer connection among a relatively small number of<br>
machines, to LANS, WANS and, of course, the global computer network known as the<br>
internet. The architecture of such networks varies widely, depending on the particular<br>
application, but most sophisticated networks make use of backbones, nodes, and computer<br>
servers supporting the transmission of data and information over such networks.<br>
Companies and individuals are increasingly relying on such data networks<br>
not only for sending and receiving information, but for transacting business, and for any<br>
conceivable number of other activities involving the sending, receiving or viewing of<br>
information. The advent of the Internet and its continued development has only increased<br>
the demand for effective communication among companies, individuals, and other users of<br>
such networks.<br>
This demand for sending and receiving data over such networks generates<br>
so-called "traffic", that is, a volume or "payload" of digitally-encoded information<br>
traversing appropriate paths on the network. Unfortunately, traffic across the network<br>
often leads to congestion or "trouble spots" at certain points or along certain paths of the<br>
network. Such congestion may take the form of maddeningly slow transmission of data,<br>
or, at worst, a complete inability to send or receive needed information over such network.<br>
This problem is compounded by the fact that, under certain network architectures, the<br>
traffic generally proceeds only as quickly as its slowest link or pathway will allow.<br>
Obviously, such traffic congestion is undesirable for any number of<br>
reasons. Users "stuck" in such traffic may blame the congestion on their network service<br>
providers, causing such providers to potentially lose business. Such network delays will<br>
also have a negative effect, both directly and indirectly, on productivity of the networks<br>
users.<br>
One approach to relieving such network congestion or other network<br>
"trouble spots" is to obtain timely and accurate information about the congestion or<br>
trouble spot. Unfortunately, attempts of the current art to unravel the intricacies of<br>
computer networks and relieve the congestion suffer from various drawbacks and<br>
disadvantages. For example, network monitoring tools of the current art may be difficult<br>
to customize, and thus may lack the necessary tools to analyze network congestion or<br>
trouble spots. Such network "sniffers" are often limited to performing traffic dumps of<br>
certain specific protocols which, again, may fail to accurately describe or pinpoint the<br>
source of network congestion. In other words, most network monitors and "sniffers" of<br>
the current art are limited in their abilities to tabulate real-time data, or to record data over<br>
extended periods of time.<br>
Network monitors of the current art generally intrude into the network in<br>
order to evaluate or estimate network performance. The reference "TCP/IP Illustrated,<br>
Volume I - The Protocols," Chapters 7 and 8, available from Addison-Wesley Publishing<br>
Co., 1994, describes one such technique. To estimate round-trip times for "packets" of<br>
information in the internet, the network monitor injects additional packets into the network<br>
and follows the travel of such additional packets. Thus, the very process of determining<br>
network performance itself further degrades performance by adding additional packets of<br>
information to the traffic.<br>
Not only is the above-described method intrusive, but it is generally<br>
inaccurate as well. In particular, one-way times are evaluated by generally dividing the<br>
round-trip delay of the test packet by two; however, half of a round-trip time is generally<br>
not equivalent to a one-way delay, in part based on asymmetries (discussed below) in the<br>
network. To compensate for this inaccuracy, certain teachings of the current art inject test<br>
packets more frequently into the network, a solution which may further degrade the<br>
performance of the network which is being tested or monitored.<br>
Network performance may be further enhanced if network traffic flow or<br>
network bandwidth dimensioning could be more accurately modeled. In particular, traffic<br>
does not necessarily flow symmetrically across a given network path. This is especially<br>
true when the path terminates in an end user on an internet connection. Such a path is<br>
asymmetric in that the end-user normally downloads more payload or traffic than he or she<br>
uploads. Network monitors of the current art generally do not detect or model such<br>
asymmetries, with the result that greater network resources are devoted to particular routes<br>
than may otherwise be required. This costs additional money and wastes computer<br>
resources.<br>
There is thus a need to improve network performance and relieve network<br>
traffic congestion. There is a further need for tools which do not intrude upon the traffic<br>
flow, which can be adapted to analyze different traffic parameters or types of "packets,"<br>
and which collect and tabulate required statistics quickly and accurately.<br>
With the increasing use of computer data networks, companies and<br>
individuals are increasingly interested in collecting, filtering, or "profiling" data about the<br>
users or their traffic on such networks. Marketing enterprises or other sales organizations<br>
may be particularly fascinated by demographic or other data which can be gleaned by<br>
accurate recording and analysis of network traffic. Unfortunately, many internet<br>
advertisers obtain customer profiles by requiring the users to fill out forms and<br>
questionnaires. Advertisers miss out on most of this customer information because<br>
customers often do not want to be bothered with answering such questions. There is thus a<br>
need to obtain customer "profiles" in a less intrusive manner.<br>
The expanding use of networks has likewise expanded the possibilities of<br>
"hackers" or other damaging intruders performing mischief or even criminal activities in<br>
proprietary or protected networks. As such, a system which can determine the origin of<br>
security breaches would be valuable to enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, to stem the<br>
tide of computer-related crimes and misdemeanors. The current art, again, generally fails<br>
to analyze, tabulate, monitor, or record the flow of data over a network in an optimal way<br>
to facilitate security activities.<br>
Companies or individuals charged with monitoring networks not only need<br>
to obtain vast amounts of information and statistics in a timely manner, but they also need<br>
to view such data quickly, easily, and in an understandable format. Again, current art<br>
solutions are often limited to providing "dumps", often chronologically, with inadequate<br>
statistical compilations or graphical representations of such data. It is thus desirable not<br>
only to compile network traffic information, but to perform certain commonly needed<br>
calculations, and to graphically represent such calculations in a user-friendly and flexible<br>
format.<br>
To overcome the shortcomings of conventional data communication<br>
monitoring methods and systems, a new method of monitoring a communication line is<br>
provided. An object of the present invention is to provide a network monitor for collecting<br>
and analyzing communication data. Another object is to provide a method for collecting<br>
and analyzing communication data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve these and other objects, and in view of its purposes, the present<br>
invention provides a method for monitoring data on a first communication line. Data is<br>
received from the first communication line and a plurality of packets are extracted from<br>
the data. Statistics are then recursively generated, the statistics corresponding to the<br>
plurality of packets.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the<br>
following detailed description are exemplary, but are not restrictive, of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawing, in which like reference numerals refer to like<br>
elements throughout, Fig. 1 illustrates an exemplary network monitor 102 according to the<br>
present invention which is coupled to an exemplary network Nl 106 via a first<br>
communication line 104. The network monitor 102 receives (monitors) data<br>
communications (traffic) on communication line 104 and provides real-time metrics or<br>
statistics of the data traffic on the communication line 104.<br>
The communication line 104 may use a single data link layer protocol to<br>
transport traffic of a multitude of different higher hierarchical protocol layer protocols.<br>
One such hierarchical protocol structure 200 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The data link layer<br>
protocol 202, Ethernet in this exemplary case, of traffic between the network Nl 106 and<br>
the router 108 may include encapsulated IPX, IP, ARP, or other network layer 204 traffic.<br>
The IP traffic may include encapsulated UDP, TCP, ICMP or other transport layer 206<br>
traffic. The TCP traffic may include encapsulated Web, FTP, Domain Name Service, or<br>
other application layer 208 traffic.<br>
The network monitor 102 according to the present invention includes<br>
hardware and software (discussed below) which collects and analyzes network traffic in<br>
such a way that it can generate a variety of real-time statistics on such traffic at one or<br>
multiple protocol layers. The real-time statistics generated by network monitor 102 enable<br>
quality and quantity of service analysis, billing based on quality of service and quantity of<br>
service, dynamic network resource allocation and planning, customer profiling based on<br>
data content, network security analysis, and session playback. Exemplary statistics<br>
include byte counts, bit counts, one-way or roundtrip delays, response times, retransmitted<br>
bytes, originating bytes per host, terminating bytes per host, originating-terminating host<br>
pair counts, web abort rates, throughput, goodput, and percent retransmitted bytes due to<br>
delays or losses. These statistics may selectively be provided based on traffic on the first<br>
communication line 104 on one or multiple protocol layers between the data link layer and<br>
the application layer.<br>
Operation of an exemplary network monitor 302 shown in Fig. 3 is described with<br>
reference to the flow chart in Fig. 4. The network monitor 302 includes a first network<br>
interface 304 coupled to a first communication line 308 by a first connection 312 and a<br>
second network interface 306 coupled to a second communication line 310 by a second<br>
connection 314. The first interface 304 receives first data (a bitstream) from the first<br>
communication line 308 (step 402) and the bitstream is then segregated into packets (step<br>
404). The term segregate is used herein to mean that previously defined packets are being<br>
extracted from the bitstream. The bitstream may be segregated into packets by either the<br>
interface 304 or by the host computer 316. The packets are stored in memory 318 which is<br>
hierarchical in this embodiment and includes a short-term memory 320 and at least one<br>
longer-term memory 322. A processor and query engine 316, optionally controlled by a<br>
user interface 324, then processes the packets as described below with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the network monitor 302 is coupled to the first<br>
communication line 308 in a non-intrusive manner. That is, it does not directly hinder the<br>
flow of traffic on the communication line. The network monitor 302 may be coupled to<br>
the communication line 308, for example, by plugging the first connection 312 into a port<br>
or jack on a switch or router, by breaking the communication line 308 and installing a Y-<br>
connector to which the first connection 312 is coupled, by connecting the first connection<br>
to a hub, using an optical splitter, or by connecting the network monitor 302 to a<br>
monitoring jack in a central office.<br>
Processor and query engine 316 converts the packets into records and stores the<br>
records in memory (steps 414-422). Processor and query engine 316 includes suitable<br>
programming to generate statistics corresponding to the packets (steps 406-412).<br>
Although the generation of statistics for the packets may be accomplished in£ variety of<br>
ways, one preferred approach processes a set of packets received over a predetermined<br>
timer interval or "sampling time" (step 406) to generate corresponding statistics (step 408).<br>
The processing is then repeated in a recursive fashion to successive sets of packets<br>
received during successive time periods (step 410). During such processing, suitable<br>
programming stores the generated statistics in memory at appropriate intervals of time,<br>
such intervals preferably on the same order as the time intervals corresponding to the sets<br>
of packets.<br>
The conversion of the packets into records permits a wide variety of further<br>
statistics to be generated as now described. The records are generated by first determining<br>
the type of each packet (step 414) and then filtering the packets (step 416) based on their<br>
determined types. An index is generated (step 418) for each packet and the packet is then<br>
converted into an indexed record (step 420) and stored in memory (step 422). Further<br>
statistics are then generated (step 426) using the statistics previously generated for the<br>
packets and records are then provided to one or more applications such as a display device<br>
(step 428), a router for dynamically adjusting network routing based on the further<br>
statistics (step 430), and a billing service for billing clients based on quality or quantity of<br>
service as determined based on the generated statistics (step 432).<br>
Application of the process of Fig. 4 is now described for an Ethernet<br>
communication line including encapsulated IP packets which encapsulate TCP packets<br>
which encapsulate web traffic (See Fig. 2). The Ethernet bitstream is received from the<br>
communication line (step 402) and is segregated into packets (step 404). The packets are<br>
divided into sets, each set including packets received during one of successive one-second<br>
time periods (exemplary time period) (step 406). The number of bits received during each<br>
one-second time period (exemplary statistic) is calculated (step 408). Successive statistics<br>
are generated for successive time periods by receiving the next set of packets<br>
corresponding to the next one-second time period (step 412) and then calculating the<br>
number of bits in those packets (step 408). The bit counts for each one-second time<br>
interval are stored in memory (step 412) as they are generated.<br>
A type (e.g. IP, ARP,...) of each packet is determined (step 414). If a user only<br>
wishes to analyze traffic of IP packets, the packets are filtered to pass only the IP packets<br>
(step 416). The time when the network monitor received each IP packet is used as an<br>
index for the each respective IP packet (418). An indexed record is then generated (step<br>
420) for each IP packet and is stored in memory (step 422). An exemplary record having<br>
the index as a first field Fl and the packet as a second field F2 is illustrated below.<br>
In addition to the filtering (step 416) only passing IP packets, the filter may also be<br>
used to pass only a portion of the packet, such as only the IP portion, by truncating the<br>
Ethernet overhead portion so the record above contains only the IP portion in the second<br>
field F2. Alternatively, the record may include a plurality of fields, each corresponding to<br>
a portion of the IP packet such as a source address or destination address, and filtering may<br>
be performed based on any one or more of the plurality of fields.<br>
Any number of statistics can be generated from the stored records alone, or in<br>
combination with statistics for the packets generated in steps 46-412. In this example, a<br>
further statistic known to the art of interest includes the ratioof the number of bits in IP<br>
packets received to the number of bits in all packets received for each successive minute<br>
(step 426). The calculation of this statistic is facilitated according to the present invention,<br>
because the stored packets are already all IP packets and are indexed by time of receipt.<br>
As such, the calculation is performed by sorting the records by index, reading the set of<br>
records for each successive minute, and adding the number of bits in each set of records.<br>
The number of bits in all packets per minute may be calculated by summing the previously<br>
calculated bit counts generated on a per second basis in groups of sixty (thereby equaling<br>
one minute). Thus, the further statistic is generated using both the stored records and the<br>
stored statistics, which reduces the number of additional calculations needed and the time<br>
to generate such further statistic.<br>
A specific example of the filtering and storing methods performed by a network<br>
monitor according to the present invention was described above with regard to Fig. 4. The<br>
flexibility of data collection and analysis methods of a network monitor 500 according to<br>
the present invention are described below with regard to the data flow diagram of Fig 5.<br>
An incoming bitstream is packetized by a packetizer 502. Decoding of the<br>
bitstream may be automatically performed for known protocols or may be performed<br>
according to user-specified parameters for custom or proprietary protocols. For example,<br>
if a new data link layer protocol is introduced, network monitor 500 includes suitable<br>
programming to respond to user-defined protocols, entered using the user interface 520.<br>
The inventive network monitor 500 thus recognizes packet structures of the new protocol<br>
to packetize an incoming bitstream. The network monitor could then perform its data<br>
collection and analysis methods through the higher protocol layers. This flexibility is not<br>
limited to the data link layer. In other words, the network monitor 500 according to the<br>
present invention is able to collect and analyze data communications for custom protocols<br>
at other protocol layers.<br>
The packets may be directly stored into the short-term memory 510 using path A.<br>
This is useful for storing all data received from the communication line. The short-term<br>
memory 508 may periodically transfer data to a long-term memory 510 to prevent<br>
overflow. Although illustrated as having only a single short-term memory 508 and a<br>
single long-term memory 510, the teachings of the present invention are applicable to<br>
other hierarchical memory structures including a plurality of memory devices. For<br>
example, the memory may include a random access memory (RAM), a disk memory, and<br>
a tape memory. As the RAM fills, data is transferred to the disk memory. As the disk<br>
memory fills, data is transferred to the tape memory. As the tape memory fills, tapes are<br>
replaced for continuous or long-term data storage for archival purposes, for example. As<br>
indicated by the double arrow to the short-term memory 508 and between the memories<br>
508, 510, data stored in the memories may later be retrieved for analysis or for one of the<br>
applications 522-530 discussed below.<br>
Storing all packets directly into memory may be desired for security applications<br>
528. For example, the network monitor may be programmed to store all communications<br>
for a period of 1 week and then overwrite the oldest stored data. If a breach in security is<br>
detected within a week of its occurrence, the stored data may be analyzed by the network<br>
monitor to determine the source and extent of the breach. t<br>
The packetized data may alternatively be provided by the packetizer 502 to the<br>
index generator 504. The index generator 504 generates an index corresponding to one or<br>
more of the received packets. Examples of an index corresponding to a packet include a<br>
time stamp to indicate the time it was received by the network monitor, the type of packet<br>
(protocol and/or layer), the size of packet, a packet number (1,2, 3,...), an interface<br>
number, an application, and an associated session. Record generator 506 receives the<br>
packets and the generated index and generates a record including the generated index.<br>
Alternatively, the record generator 506 may combine the received packet and index with<br>
an existing record previously stored in memory 508, 510. The record generator may also<br>
receive a packet directly via path C and generate an unindexed record including the packet<br>
or may combine the packet into an existing record previously stored in memory 508,510.<br>
For example, a single record may be generated corresponding to an ATM session.<br>
When a first cell (a fixed size packet) corresponding to the ATM session is received, it<br>
may be indexed and an indexed record may be generated and stored in the memory 508,<br>
510. The index may be an identifier of the ATM session, for example. When further cells<br>
corresponding to the ATM session are received, not necessarily in order, the record<br>
generator 506 may directly receive these cells via path C, read the previously stored<br>
indexed record from memory 508,510, and then combine the newly received cell into the<br>
indexed record. In addition to simply combining packets belonging to a common ATM<br>
session in a common record, the record generator 506 may also orient the received ATM<br>
cells within the record in their correct order.<br>
The record/packet type identifier 512 receives packets or records from either the<br>
record generator 506 or from the memory 508 and then characterizes the received packets<br>
or records by identifying its corresponding "type" or "property". The type or property of a<br>
packet or record is a versatile identifier and may be programmed via the user interface 520.<br>
Examples of packet or record types or properties include the number of corresponding bits<br>
or bytes, its protocol layer, its protocol type at a particular protocol layer, a source address,<br>
a destination address, an end-user ID, and an application ID. The records or packets are<br>
then filtered in the packet type filter 516 based on the property or type identified by the<br>
record/packet type identifier 512. The filtered records or packets are then indexed,<br>
indexed and turned into records, or directly stored into memory 508,510.<br>
The time period filter 514 receives records or packets from the record generator or<br>
the memory 508,510, and filters them based on the time they were received from the<br>
communication line by the network monitor. The records or packets are then segregated<br>
into groups corresponding to packets received by the network monitor during respective<br>
successive time periods. The statistic generator 518 then generates statistics for each of<br>
the successive time periods corresponding to packets received during each respective<br>
successive time period.<br>
The filtered packets and the generated statistics may be stored in memory. The<br>
paths between the functional blocks in Fig. 5 illustrate that the contents of memory may<br>
then again be used to perform further filtering or statistic generation. Thus, a network<br>
monitor according to the present invention may recursively collect and analyze data by<br>
generating statistics based on previously generated statistics or stored packets.<br>
In addition to programming the network monitor for a custom protocol as.<br>
described above, the user interface 520 may also define the operating parameters of the<br>
functional blocks within the network monitor. For example, a user may specify the index<br>
to be used by the index generator 504, the time period to be used by the time period filter<br>
514, and the statistics to be generated by the statistic generator 518 for each of the<br>
successive time periods.<br>
The collected data and the corresponding analysis generated by the network<br>
monitor 500 may be provided to one or more applications 522-530. For example, a<br>
display device 522 may display statistics, records or packets responsive to user selection as<br>
further described below with regard to the display screens in Figs. 10-28.<br>
The statistics generated by the network monitor 500 may be provided to a network<br>
administrator or router 524 to allow for dynamic routing of communications and network<br>
bandwidth management, also known as "yield management", on a network responsive to<br>
statistics corresponding to network performance. It is readily appreciated that, by<br>
measuring one-way delays and by providing traffic statistics on a protocol-by-protocol<br>
basis at different protocol layers, a network monitor according to the present invention can<br>
identify these asymmetries by quantifying traffic flows to allow a network administrator to<br>
properly size network resources according to the measured flows.<br>
Communication networks can be optimized at the service layer because the<br>
network monitor according to the present invention includes suitable programming to<br>
analyze traffic flows at any protocol layer. Although different services may have different<br>
service requirements, these services are often integrated in a single communication<br>
network. Nonetheless, services such as real-time multimedia, voice over IP, data, and<br>
Intranet may each have unique network service requirements. For example, for voice over<br>
IP, due to low tolerances in voice transmissions degradation, a lower quality of service<br>
including delay or loss of data may not be tolerated. In contrast, data transmission can<br>
proceed in a lossy environment due to error recovery by retransmission. An exemplary<br>
router 524 is configured to route traffic corresponding to different services differently<br>
depending on their service requirements.<br>
The network monitor according to the present invention includes programmed<br>
features which identify flows corresponding to each individual service and/or user and<br>
provide for analysis of interactions with different services. This information may be used<br>
by a router, for example, to make real-time or non-real-time decisions on optimizing<br>
network topologies, routes, or service segregation, etc. to achieve an optimal configuration<br>
suitable for providing each and every service with its own unique quality of service<br>
requirement.<br>
A billing system 526 may be configured to receive quality and/or quantity of<br>
service statistics corresponding to different services and different hosts and bill clients<br>
accordingly. This allows clients to be billed based on these statistics rather than providing<br>
flat rate billing for previously unmeasured service. For example, a client may use her<br>
unlimited Internet service for voice over IP communication. According to the present<br>
invention, the network monitor 500 may generate statistics for a particular client on the<br>
number, duration, and destination of voice over EP calls. The statistics are then converted<br>
to billing information by the billing system 526 and the client is billed accordingly. Thus,<br>
an Internet subscriber that uses the Internet for voice over IP calls, may now be billed<br>
according to the quantity, duration, and destination of calls as is done for non-Internet<br>
telephone service. Clients may similarly be billed based on a number of e-commerce<br>
transactions, a number of stock trades, a number of requests for real-time stock quotes, and<br>
other transactions. Alternatively, clients may have service contracts including different<br>
billing rates depending on a quality of service provided and may be billed accordingly. A<br>
network monitor may also be used to ensure compliance with service contracts which<br>
guarantee minimum service standards or service level agreements.<br>
As described above, the collected data may be used for security 528 to identify<br>
breaches in security, to identify improper network use or illegal activity. For example,<br>
packets may be filtered to identify particular files which have been FTP"d to a server, to<br>
identify who telnetted (logged onto) a particular machine or server, and to see what they<br>
typed once logged on.<br>
Statistics from a network monitor may be correspond to a user or a group of users<br>
for profiling the user or group. Much Internet advertising is directed to customers based<br>
on a customer profile generated by asking a user to answer a few questions. A network<br>
monitor according to the present invention can filter each received packet based on its<br>
contents to build individual customer profiles. For example, a node which monitors the<br>
Philadelphia customer base may look at every packet from every user before it enters the<br>
Internet. Also, the returned traffic to these users can be analyzed by looking (filtering) for<br>
specific text within the packets or for the web sites visited by the user. A profile per user<br>
or group of users may then be generated based on the filtered data to target content to the<br>
user which will be of interest to the user such as targeted email. The method described<br>
above for filtering may similarly be used by law enforcement or security officials to<br>
monitor communications to detect unlawful activity or to monitor activity of selected<br>
users.<br>
The network monitor may also be used to provide data to a playback device 530 to<br>
playback client sessions which were monitored from the communications line. AH<br>
received packets may be recorded and then filtered based on a particular session. The<br>
session may be identified based on information included in the packets themselves or<br>
based on session information received in special packets or channels such as SDR (session<br>
directory protocol). The packets corresponding to the session may then be played back in<br>
a fashion originally presented to the user. This method may be used to replay all web<br>
activity of a user or of voice over IP conversations.<br>
The network monitor may be configured by a user to monitor communication lines<br>
that transport traffic using a proprietary or custom protocol. Along with a suitable<br>
physical layer interface between the network monitor and the communication line, a user<br>
may enter proprietary protocol parameters using the user interface. The parameters define<br>
the structure of packets within the bitstream transported on the communication line for the<br>
network monitor to segregate the packets from the bitstream. Additional parameters may<br>
also define fields within a packet so the network monitor could be configured with custom<br>
queries to provide statistics based on the content of these packet fields. The network<br>
monitor may similarly be programmed to receive and analyze data corresponding to<br>
custom protocols at layers higher than the link layer.<br>
In an exemplary network, the data transmission protocol provides for each packet<br>
to include a time stamp field. Packets transmitted from a source to a destination include a<br>
time stamp value in the time stamp field indicating a time of transmission by the source.<br>
When the packet is received at the destination, the destination can compute the one-way<br>
transmission duration or delay from the source to the destination by subtracting the time<br>
stamp value from a current time value. This protocol allows for simpler one-way<br>
transmission delay and quality of service measurements by eliminating the need for<br>
communication between network monitors to match packet pairs at separate network<br>
monitors.<br>
For a network including many separate intermediate transmission paths between<br>
the source and the destination, the one-way end-to-end transmission duration information<br>
does not provide information regarding a particular bottleneck somewhere between the<br>
source and destination. For improved bottleneck diagnosis, rather than only calculate end-<br>
to-end delays, a network monitor according to the present invention can be coupled to one<br>
of the intermediate separate transmission paths between the source and destination. The<br>
network monitor can receive the time stamp value from a packet traversing the network<br>
from the source to the destination. The time stamp value may be subtracted to the current<br>
time at time of receipt of the packet by the network monitor to determine an intermediate<br>
duration value. One or more intermediately spaced monitors may be used as described<br>
above to locate the bottleneck in a network. In an exemplary embodiment each of the<br>
source, destination, and network monitor include a GPS (global positioning satellite)<br>
interface for receiving the current time used to calculate the transmission duration.<br>
One of the metrics that a network monitor according to the present invention can<br>
provide is an indication of the number of aborted connections for a particular source-<br>
destination pair, for a particular source or destination, and information on the ration of<br>
aborted connections to total connections for a particular source or destination. An<br>
exemplary method of identifying troubled TCP (transmission control protocol) servers is<br>
described with regard to the flow chart 600 in Fig. 6.<br>
As known to those skilled in the art, a TCP session is normally opened by the<br>
client and is then closed by the server when it has no more data to send to the client. If a<br>
TCP session is closed by the client, this indicates that the session is being terminated<br>
prematurely. Using the web as an example, a client (user using browser) may close the<br>
session for reasons including simply changing one"s mind regarding the need for the<br>
desired data or due to impatience due to delay in receiving desired data.<br>
The network monitor receives a packet from a communication line (step 602) and<br>
identifies whether the packet belongs to a TCP session (step 604). The network monitor<br>
may identify whether the packet is a TCP packet by identifying and decoding a protocol<br>
field in the packet which identifies which of several transport layer protocols the packet<br>
belongs to. Once a packet is identified as TCP, the TCP client and TCP server are<br>
identified (step 606). The packet is then examined to determine whether it opens or is<br>
initiating the TCP connection (step 608). If the packet is the opening or initiating packet<br>
of a TCP session, a count of the total number of TCP sessions for the previously identified<br>
(in step 606) TCP server is incremented (step 610).<br>
If the packet is not an opening packet, the network monitor next determines<br>
whether the packet is closing the TCP connection (step 612). If not, the network monitor<br>
gets the next packet (step 602). Otherwise, the network monitor determines (step 614)<br>
whether the connection is being closed by the server, by examining the FIN Bit for<br>
example, or whether the connection is being closed by the client. Closure by the server<br>
indicates normal termination of the session and the network monitor gets the next packet<br>
(step 602). Closure by other than the server indicated premature termination of the session<br>
and a premature closure count corresponding to the particular server is incremented (step<br>
616). The ratio of premature closures to the total TCP sessions of the particular server is<br>
calculated (step 620) and compared to a predetermined threshold value (step 622). If the<br>
ratio of premature closures exceeds the threshold, the particular server is identified as a<br>
"troubled server" (step 624).<br>
As known to those skilled in the art, in some networks all packets corresponding to<br>
a particular TCP session may not travel through the same communication line and<br>
therefore may not be detected by a single network monitor interface. A network monitor<br>
can be placed in proximity to or on a server or client to "catch" all packets. Alternatively,<br>
multiple network monitor interfaces may be used as described above to store records<br>
corresponding to packets. The stored records may then be analyzed to determine which<br>
servers may be "troubled". In an exemplary embodiment, remote network monitors each<br>
look for FIN packets, using a filter, for example, and upon detecting a FIN packet they<br>
send a message including the contents of the FIN packet to a central monitor that makes<br>
the "troubled server" determination.<br>
Although the teachings regarding measuring aborted connections and identifying<br>
troubled servers are described above with regard to TCP sessions, these teachings are<br>
generally applicable to other protocols and to other protocol layers and are not limited to<br>
identifying troubled TCP servers. For example, in another protocol, a session may be both<br>
opened and closed by the same node, whether it be the client or the server. In addition, the<br>
session payloads may be transmitted in separate packets from or on separate<br>
communication links from the session control messages.<br>
In a futher alternative embodiment shown in Fig. 7, a system 701 for monitoring<br>
communications according to the present invention may include one or more network<br>
monitors each coupled to respective communication lines in a.network as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
First, second, and third network monitor 700, 710, 720 are coupled to the first, second, and<br>
third communication lines 702, 712, 722, respectively. Each network monitor 700, 710,<br>
720 collects and analyzes data received from its respective communications line as<br>
described above with regard to the data flow diagram in Fig. 5.<br>
In addition to providing independent data collection and analysis, a system<br>
including a plurality of network monitors 700, 710, 730 may correlate data received at the<br>
different network monitors to provide improved network performance analysis. For<br>
example, one-way delay may be calculated for data traveling from the first communication<br>
line 702 to the second communication line 712.<br>
An exemplary method of calculating the one-way delay is illustrated by the flow<br>
chart in Fig. 8. Generally, the "same" packet is identified at two separate network<br>
monitors and the difference in time between when it was received by each monitor is used<br>
to calculate the one-way delay. The "same" packet is identified by zeroing out portions of<br>
the packet that change between the separate network monitors.<br>
Each of the first and second network monitors 700,710 receives data (step 802,<br>
806) from its respective communication line 702, 712. The packetizer 502 segregates the<br>
received data into packets (steps 803, 807) and each the index generator (504) associates<br>
the time of receipt (time stamp) of each packet with each packet. The record generator 506<br>
generates a record including the time stamp of corresponding to each packet and a unique<br>
portion of the data packet (UDPD) and stores the record in memory 508,510 (steps 804,<br>
808).<br>
The UPDP is a portion of the received packet that makes the data unit uniquely<br>
identifiable. For example, for an Ethernet communications line and an IP payload, the<br>
Ethernet header is removed from the packet, the IP ttl and checksum fields are zeroed, and<br>
the IP header and the 20 succeeding bytes are saved and incorporated by the record<br>
generator 506 into a UPDP record. The UPDP may be different for different protocols and<br>
may be programmed using the user interface.<br>
The UPDP records of the first network monitor 700 are compared to the UPDP<br>
records of the second network monitor 710 to match pairs of UPDPs (step 810). The first<br>
and second network monitors may communicate via a communication link 730. The<br>
communication link 730 may be implemented by communication of the network monitors<br>
through the network they are monitoring (in-band). Alternatively, the communication link<br>
730 may be implemented by communication external to the network over a telephone line,<br>
a radio connection, or a satellite connection, for example (out-of-band).<br>
For each matched pair of UPDPs, the corresponding time stamp ts2 from the<br>
second network monitor is subtracted from the corresponding time stamp tsl from the first<br>
network monitor (step 812). This time difference tsl-ts2 represents the duration for the<br>
data corresponding to the UPDP to travel from the second network monitor 710 to the first<br>
network monitor 700. By calculating the UPDP, the transmission duration of a certain<br>
payload between first and second communication lines 702, 712 using the same or<br>
different communication protocols may be determined according to the method described"<br>
above.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the time difference tsl-ts2 is normalized (steps 814,<br>
816) to account for the delay of the first communication line 702. The delay is normalized<br>
by subtracting the delay xmit-delay for the packet corresponding to the UPDP to traverse<br>
the first communication line from the time difference as illustrated by the equation below:<br>
Normalized Network Delay = (tsl-ts2) - (link_speed/packet_length)<br>
where link_speed is the transmission rate on the first communication line 712, and<br>
packetlength is the length of the packet on the first communication line which contained<br>
the UPDP. The calculated network delay may include components due to queuing delay<br>
and to transmission delay. As illustrated by the data flow diagram in Fig. 5, the statistic<br>
generator 518 can receive the packet for which is UPDP record is to be generated, the<br>
statistic generator 518 calculates the number of bits in the packet and provide this statistic<br>
to the record generator for incorporation into the UPDP record for use in a normalization<br>
calculation. Round-trip times may be estimated by similarly calculating the delay from the<br>
first to the second network monitor and adding this delay to the delay between from the<br>
second to the first network monitor.<br>
The accuracy of the calculated transmission delay depends on the synchronization<br>
of the time clocks of the first and second network monitors 700, 710. The network<br>
monitors may communicate via communication line 730 to synchronize their respective<br>
clocks. In an exemplary embodiment, the network monitors are synchronized by receiving<br>
a time signal from a common time source 740. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
transmission delay is generated at a level of accuracy less than 10 microseconds, that is,<br>
the difference between the calculated delay and the actual delay is less than 10<br>
microseconds. In a preferred embodiment, the common time source 740 is a system of<br>
global satellites such as the global positional satellites (GPS) and each network monitor<br>
700, 710 includes a receiver for receiving a time signal from one or more global satellites.<br>
When the two communication lines to be monitored are proximate to each other, one of<br>
the first and second network monitors 700,710 may include a master GPS receiver and the<br>
other may include a slave GPS receiver coupled to the master.<br>
An exemplary network monitor is implemented with a host computer having an<br>
interface computer on a network interface card (NIC) coupled to the communication line it<br>
is monitoring. As described above, data received by the NIC may be processed before<br>
being sent to the host computer. Also as described above, the network monitor may use<br>
the time of receipt of data from the communication line for generating network<br>
communication statistics or metrics. In order to accurately record the time when data is<br>
received from the communication line, the interface computer associates a time of receipt<br>
with the data (time stamps the data). By having the interface computer rather than the host<br>
computer time stamp the data, inaccuracies in the time of receipt due to a delay in<br>
transferring data from the interface computer to the host computer are reduced or<br>
eliminated.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the interface computer includes an interface clock<br>
and the host computer has a host clock. The host clock and the interface clock are<br>
synchronized so the host computer can use the time stamp to accurately generate statistics<br>
corresponding to the received data. In an exemplary embodiment, the interface clock is<br>
implemented as a counter. As each packet is received from the communications line, the<br>
current value of the counter is associated with that packet. The packet is later transferred<br>
to the host computer with the counter value. The host computer includes a host clock<br>
synchronized with an absolute time reference. As described above, the absolute time<br>
reference may be provided by a global positioning satellite.<br>
The host clock and the interface clock are synchronized by correlating the counter<br>
values associated with each packet by the interface computer with the absolute time<br>
reference. The method of synchronizing the interface clock with the host clock is<br>
described with reference to the flow charts in Figs. 9A and 9B with regard to the host<br>
computer and the interface computer, respectively. Generally, the host computer<br>
periodically requests the value of the interface clock counter from the interface computer<br>
and uses this value to correlate the counter to the host clock.<br>
Referring to Figs. 9A an 9B, if the host computer has received a set of packets<br>
from the interface computer (step 902), the host computer proceeds to request the counter<br>
value (step 906) from the interface computer by sending a "get counter" message to the<br>
interface computer. In an exemplary embodiment, the interface computer stores a set of<br>
packets in a memory of the host computer by a direct memory access (DMA) operation<br>
and then interrupts the host computer to indicate the transfer of packets. If the host<br>
computer has not received a set of packets, the host computer waits for packets for a<br>
timeout period (step 904), after which it requests the counter value (step 906). The host<br>
computer records the host clock"s time (step 906) when it requests the interface counter<br>
value.<br>
When the interface computer receives a "get counter" message (step 920) from the<br>
host computer, the interface computer then determines (step 922) whether it is currently<br>
idle or whether it is receiving data from the communication line. If not idle, the interface<br>
computer sends (step 924) a "try again" message to the host computer. If idle, the<br>
interface computer then reads the counter value and subtracts a precomputed interrupt<br>
service time (step 926) to generate an adjusted counter value. The interface computer then<br>
sends (step 928) the adjusted counter value to the host computer.<br>
The precomputed interrupt service time corresponds to the duration of time<br>
between when the interface computer receives the counter request from the host to when<br>
the interface computer provides the host computer with the adjusted counter value. The<br>
precomputed interrupt service time may be determined experimentally using a logic<br>
analyzer, for example to measure the duration of time between when the interface receives<br>
the request for the counter until the interface provides the counter value. To match the<br>
experimental delay measurements to the delay during normal operation, the experimental<br>
request is provided to the interface when the interface is known to be idle and the interface<br>
only services a request during normal operation when idle. As known to those skilled in<br>
the art, the response time of the interface computer may be taken repeatedly to generate an<br>
average service time for use during operation.<br>
Upon receipt of the counter value, the host computer computes (step 912) an<br>
estimate of the relative frequency of the interface clock counter to the host computer clock.<br>
The relative frequency may be used to correlating counter values associated with packets *<br>
received from the interface computer until the next execution of the synchronization<br>
routine. In an exemplary embodiment, the host computer subtracts a host interrupt service<br>
time from the time recorded in step 906 before computing the relative frequency to<br>
account for the delay between the time when the host receives the count from the interface<br>
to the time when the host computes the relative frequency.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a multiple network interfaces each coupled to a<br>
respective communication line are implemented as a single unit and share a common<br>
clock. Thus, synchronization with only the common clock synchronizes the host clock<br>
with the time stamps associated with data received from any of the respective<br>
communication lines.<br>
Figs. 10-28 are exemplary screen displays illustrating a graphical user interface<br>
(GUI) for displaying data collected and analyzed by a network monitor and for controlling<br>
data analysis by a network monitor according to the present invention. The display in Fig.<br>
10 includes a tables frame 1010, a second frame 1030, and a buttons frame 1050. The<br>
tables frame 1010 includes a first portion 1011 with selectable boxes for user selection and<br>
text input boxes and a second portion 1012 with tables of statistics corresponding to<br>
received data. The tables 1023 which appear below the selectable buttons, boxes and<br>
fields include entries corresponding to the particular data being analyzed. The plots frame<br>
1030 includes plots 1032,1034 illustrating statistics corresponding to received data. The<br>
buttons frame 1050 includes a set of user-configurable buttons.<br>
The text input boxes and the selectable boxes in the first portion 1011 of the tables<br>
frame 1010 may optionally be fixed to prevent user selection of the options and prevent<br>
user entry in the text boxes. The functions associated with the options and boxes<br>
displayed in Fig. 10 are described below:<br>
1. Start: The start field 1013 specifies the beginning time from which the traffic<br>
is analyzed and its results are displayed in the GUI.<br>
2. Stop: The Stop field 1014 specifies the ending time to which the traffic is<br>
analyzed and its results are displayed in the GUI. Thus the Start/Stop fields<br>
1013, 1014 specify the time between which the traffic has been analyzed and<br>
presented to the user via the GUI. The contents of the Start and Stop fields<br>
1013,1014 may be displayed in multiple formats. For example, the contents<br>
are shown in a date format in Fig. 10. Alternatively, the contents may be<br>
displayed as +/- hours to indicate that a time relative to the current time, the<br>
term "now" may be used to represent the current time, or the term "never" may<br>
be used to represent that the data should be continuously updated.<br>
3. Window: The Window field 1015 indicates the time intervals at which to<br>
compute values to be plotted in the second frame 1030. For example, if a user<br>
enters "1" as the Window field, then the values in the plot field are plotted<br>
every second. The user may enter the values in the Window field in using units<br>
as appropriate to indicate the resolution of the plots (e.g. Is, lms, lOOus, ...to<br>
indicate a time resolution if the unit of the horizontal scale is time). An empty<br>
Window field 1015 indicates that the resolution on the horizontal scale should<br>
be automatically set.<br>
4. Top N: The Top N field 1016 specifies the maximum number of entries for the<br>
tables 1023 which appear in the second portion 1012 of the tables frame 1010.<br>
If Top N is 10, then the table 1023 will include 10 rows sorted by a particular<br>
column value in descending order. If TopN is -10, then the table 1023 will<br>
include 10 rows sorted by a particular column value in ascending order (i.e. this<br>
becomes the notion of BottomN).<br>
5. Filter: The Filter window 1017 describes a filter to be applied to the data to be<br>
displayed. For example, Filter could be "protocol IEEE802.3" to display<br>
results for packets with link layer protocol IEEE802.3. For data previously<br>
filtered to show only IP traffic, a Filter of "host 10.0.0.1" would display results<br>
for IP traffic where either the source or destination host was 10.0.0.1. Various<br>
complex filters are also possible.<br>
6. Do DNS: The Do DNS checkbox 1018 converts entries in the tables 1023 from<br>
a numerical representation to a textual representation. For example, in IP a<br>
numerical representation (the IP address) is used to identify a host. A DNS<br>
(Domain Name Server) may contain a mapping from this numerical<br>
representation of the IP address to a textual representation. For example, the IP<br>
address 10.0.0.1 may be converted to the textual representation foo.niksun.com<br>
when the Do DNS checkbox is checked. For protocols other than DNS the<br>
label given to the checkbox will vary accordingly with an equivalent<br>
functionality.<br>
7. Help: The help buttons 1019 next to each field when selected cause display of<br>
context-sensitive assistance. For example, if the help button next to Filter 1017<br>
is selected, a help window for Filters would pop up.<br>
8. Refresh: The Refresh button 1020 refreshes the contents of all frames.<br>
9. Forward and Backward Buttons: The forward 1021 and backward 1022<br>
buttons at the top of first portion 1011 of the tables frame 1010 function similar<br>
to the "Forward" and "Back" buttons of a browser with the added feature of<br>
keeping the contents of all frames aligned. In contrast, clicking the "Forward"<br>
and "Back" buttons of a browser causes forward of backward movements on a<br>
frame by frame basis hence loosing correspondence between the various<br>
frames.<br>
The plots frame 1030 includes plots 1032, 1034 , text input boxes and selectable<br>
boxes and buttons. The text input boxes and the selectable boxes may optionally be fixed<br>
to prevent user selection of the options and prevent user entry in the text boxes. The<br>
functions associated with the options and boxes displayed in the plots frame 1030 of Fig.<br>
10 are described below:<br>
1. Update Tables and Plots: This button 1036 updates the tables and frames in a<br>
coordinated manner. For example, if a user zooms in by selecting a portion of<br>
the plot with a mouse, then clicking this button 1036 would update the plots<br>
and tables for the selected time range that was zoomed into.<br>
2. Byte/Packet Counts (and Bit/Packet Rates) (and Utilization): This button<br>
1037 changes between one of three options upon selection: "Byte/Packet<br>
Counts", "Bit/Packet Rates", and "Utilization". The plots also change from<br>
Byte/Packet Counts over a certain window, to Bit and Packet Rates (i.e.<br>
number of bits or packets per second), to Utilization accordingly. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the byte plot displays normalized values relative to the<br>
link speed (i.e. bit rate divided by link or channel or virtual circuit capacity in<br>
bits per second).<br>
3. Toggle Parent Plot: This button 1038 toggles the line on the plots as described<br>
below.<br>
4. Toggle Plot of Average: Selection of the Toggle Plot of Average button 1039<br>
toggles whether the average value (not shown) of the y-axis of the plots is<br>
displayed.<br>
5. Play/Forward/Stop/Fast Forward/Rewind/Fast Rewind/Pause Buttons:<br>
These buttons 1040 control the playing of the plots on the screen to allow the<br>
plots to be updated over time and to scroll with time. The tables 1023 in the<br>
table frame 1010 are be updated to match the plots 1032,1034.<br>
6. Top Plot: The top plot 1032 shown in Fig. 10 is a Link Level Bit Rate plot in<br>
bytes/second.<br>
7. Bottom Plot: The bottom plot 1034 in Fig. 10 is a Link Level Packet Rate blot<br>
in packets/second.<br>
The table 1023 in the tables frame 1010 is automatically generated based upon<br>
protocols found to be active in the interval specified by the Start 1013 and Stop 1014<br>
fields. In Fig. 10, the table 1023 shows that between the Start and Stop times, 264K<br>
(K=1000"s) IP packets and 919 ARP packets were received by the network monitor. The<br>
IP packets and ARP packets containing 99M and 55K bytes, respectively (M=l ,000,000).<br>
The entries in the table 1023 are selectable to sort data by the selected field. For<br>
example, if the packets heading in the table was clicked then the table would be sorted by<br>
the packets column in descending order of activity and if this header is clicked again, then<br>
it would be sorted in the opposite order. Selection of the other table headings similarly<br>
sorts the entries.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates the zooming capability of the present invention. The start/stop<br>
time interval of 7:18/12:02 in Fig. 10 is narrowed to the 9:00/10:00 time interval in Fig.<br>
11. The table 1023 and plots 1032,1034 have been updated accordingly. The start 1013<br>
and stop 1014 field values may be adjusted by either manual entry in the fields 1013,1014<br>
themselves, or by graphical selection, by a mouse for example, of an interval of time in the<br>
plots 1032,1034. Upon selection, the display will zoom into the selected interval.<br>
Zooming in on the plots causes the plots to be regenerated for the interval selected by the<br>
user. Selection of the "Update Tables and Plots" button 1036 will then synchronize data in<br>
the tables frame 1010 to the plots 1032,1034. The plots could also be updated<br>
automatically, if the user selected the "auto-synch" feature (not shown). The "Update<br>
Tables and Plots" button 1036 allows a user to zoom in several times to a desired time<br>
interval without updating the data. This provides the advantage of reducing unnecessary<br>
processing by the network monitor until the final interval is chosen.<br>
The protocols listed as entries in the table 1023 in Fig. 10 are selectable by a user,<br>
as hyper-links, for example, to list protocols encapsulated within the selected protocol.<br>
Clicking or selecting the IP entry in table 1023 in Fig. 10 results in the display of Fig. 12.<br>
The selection causes the plots 1032,1034 in the plots frame 1030 of Fig. 10 to<br>
automatically update to show only IP traffic in plots 1232,1243 in Fig. 12.<br>
The plots illustrate all traffic from the link layer as a line chart 1235 and all IP<br>
traffic as a bar chart. This dual-display format provides a graphical representation of the<br>
perspective between all traffic of one level (IP in this case) compared to all traffic of a<br>
previous level (Ethernet in this case).<br>
The contents of the tables in the tables frame 1210 are also updated to correspond<br>
to IP traffic. Table 1223 lists all IP protocols which were in use on the link being<br>
monitored between the "Start" and "Stop" times. In this particular case, only TCP, UDP<br>
and ICMP IP protocols were found. Activity by IP hosts may also be displayed. By<br>
scrolling down the table frame 1210, the table of IP counts by source host is seen as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 13 for the case where TopN=2.<br>
In Fig. 13, traffic is displayed in a source host table 1302 for traffic generated by<br>
hosts, in a destination host table 1304 for traffic received by a host, and in a host table<br>
1306 for traffic generated and received by a host. Clicking on a link 1308 in the tables<br>
frame 1310 will generate a display of a "host-pairs" table 1402 shown in Fig. 14.<br>
The host-pairs table 1402 lists the total number of packets and bytes sent between<br>
pairs of hosts for each identified pair.<br>
Selection of a "destination host" such as 10.0.0.47 (1404 in Fig. 14) will further<br>
filter the traffic by the selected "destination host" to show only traffic destined for host<br>
10.0.0.47. This is illustrated in Fig. 15 where table 1502 shows traffic destined to<br>
10.0.0.47, all from host 128.32.130.10 in this case for traffic monitored between the start<br>
and stop interval.<br>
Thus, we see that only host 128.32.130.10 was sending traffic to 10.0.0.47 between<br>
the "Start" and "Stop" times. Note that the plots 1532,1534 in the plots frame 1530 now<br>
show this activity between these two hosts as a bar chart 1535 and all IP traffic as a line<br>
chart 1536. Colors may also be used to distinguish the data in the plots or tables.<br>
If the TCP entry in table 1223 in Fig. 12 is selected, we move up the protocol stack<br>
and the tables frame 1610 is updated as shown in Fig. 16 to include TCP level counts for<br>
each underlying application 1612. For example, there were 27K HTTP (web) packets<br>
which contained 21 MegaBytes which were received during the designated time interval.<br>
In Fig. 16, if the "TCP flows" button 1604 is selected, all TCP flows are displayed<br>
with their time durations and performance metrics as shown in Fig. 17. A TCP flow<br>
contains a set of packets belonging to one TCP session between two hosts. Each flow may<br>
be plotted or its corresponding packets viewed by selecting the "plot" button 1702 or the<br>
"pkts" button 1704, respectively, corresponding to the desired TCP flow. Note that if the<br>
Do DNS option had been selected, all TCP host IP addresses would be replaced by their<br>
respective names (e.g. foo.niksun.com). A user may aggregate flows by clicking on other<br>
links such as the ones that identify a particular host such as 10.0.0.47. If a user clicks on<br>
10.0.0.47 (1706), aggregated flows for host 10.0.0.47 will be displayed as shown in Fig.<br>
18.<br>
Fig. 18 shows all TCP flows originating from host 10.0.0.47. The display in Fig.<br>
18 is generated by applying a filter selective to the 10.0.0.47 host to the data displayed in<br>
Fig. 17. Further filters can similarly be applied by clicking on other hosts (hyperlinks) in<br>
Fig. 18. For example, in the "Term host" column, if a user selects host 10.0.0.5 (1802),<br>
then all TCP flows between host 10.0.0.47 (as source) and host 10.0.0.5 (as destination)<br>
are displayed.<br>
A "TCP performance" selection may be provided, in the screen display of Fig. 16,<br>
for example, for generating TCP performance tables. By clicking on the "TCP<br>
performance" hyperlink, performance tables 1902 for TCP are displayed as shown in Fig.<br>
19. The whole tables frame is displayed in Fig. 19 or clarity. The display includes a<br>
"Troubled TCP Clients" table and a "Troubled TCP Servers" table for the worst two<br>
performing TCP clients and servers (TopN field value of 2). Over the time interval<br>
specified by the Start and Stop fields, the tables show the following measurements for each<br>
TCP client or server:<br>
1. No. of Connections: This is the total number of TCP connections to the<br>
client or server.<br>
2. TCP Data Bytes: This shows the total number of data bytes carried by all<br>
the TCP connections.<br>
3. TCP goodput (Bytes/sec): This shows the TCP payload throughput<br>
(application throughput) or TCP goodput. That is, the total number of<br>
application bytes divided by time it takes to send these bytes averaged over<br>
the number of connections.<br>
4. TCP throughput (Bytes/sec): This shows the total number of bytes carried<br>
in the TCP connections divided by time (TCP flow rate).<br>
5. Avg RTT: This shows the average Round Trip Time between the client and<br>
server over the number of connections.<br>
6. Avg Response: This shows the average response time from the server to<br>
the client.<br>
7. Retransmit %: This shows the percentage of TCP bytes which were<br>
retransmitted (due to congestion, loss, or delay, or any other reason).<br>
The TCP performance tables may be customized to add other metrics or delete<br>
existing metrics via the user interface.<br>
Selecting the http hyperlink in Fig. 16 results in the display of statistics for web<br>
traffic (http) as shown in Fig. 20.<br>
An "http performance" selection may be provided, in the screen display of Fig. 20,<br>
for example, for generating http performance tables. By clicking on the "http<br>
performance" hyperlink, performance tables 2102 for http are displayed as shown in Fig.<br>
21. The whole tables frame is displayed in Fig. 21 for clarity. The display includes a<br>
"Troubled WWW Clients" table and a "Troubled WWW Servers" table for the worst two<br>
performing WWW clients and servers (TopN field value of 2).<br>
The metrics in the http performance tables 2102 may be generated online and<br>
displayed to the user as troubled www clients and www servers or may be fed directly to a<br>
network management system for immediate action. These metrics can help a network<br>
administrator to identify bad servers and connections. This information may also be used<br>
to as the basis to notify the web server operator to buy more bandwidth or to |ix his server.<br>
Further, it can be used to notify clients that they may need more bandwidth or they may<br>
need to choose another service provider. Accordingly, these metrics may be used to<br>
improve the quality of service given to users and ultimately may provide further revenue<br>
to the network administrator. For example, in the table "Troubled WWW Servers", the<br>
second server listed (204.162.96.10) had about 33% web aborts. This could indicate a<br>
potential loss of 33% of the customers from this web site.<br>
The tables frame 1610 is updated as shown in Fig. 16 to include TCP level counts<br>
for each underlying application 1612. For example, there were 27K HTTP (web) packets<br>
which contained 21 MegaBytes which were received during the designated time interval.<br>
Upon selection of the UDP hyperlink 1240 in Fig. 12, we move up the protocol<br>
stack and the display of Fig. 22 is provided to illustrate levels of UDP traffic. In the tables<br>
frame 2210, a "UDP Level Counts" tables is displayed showing activity for each UDP<br>
application or UDP port. For example, the display indicated that there were 453 domain<br>
packets which contained 69 KiloBytes.<br>
Note that UDP bandwidth usage was only about 0.32% of the total IP (see table<br>
1223 in Fig. 12). Thus, the plots frame shows only IP traffic (RED graph) which dwarfs<br>
the UDP traffic (in BLUE). By clicking on the "Toggle Parent Display" the user can now<br>
zoom the Y-axis only on the UDP traffic (this is not illustrated) as the plot for IP (parent<br>
plot) will be removed.<br>
Selection of the "MBONE" button 2202 in Fig. 22 results in display of an<br>
application layer analysis of MBONE (Multimedia backbone) sessions as shown in Fig.<br>
23.<br>
Selection of the "View Packets" button 2204 in the buttons frame 2250 in Fig. 22<br>
gives a dump of all packets as shown in Fig. 24. Since the network monitor can record all<br>
packets, all packets and their contents can be viewed. The links in the display of Fig. 24<br>
allow a user to flexibly filter the data streams. If the user clicks on 10.0.0.12 (2402), then<br>
the next screen of dumps will only contain packets to and from 10.0.0.12. In that next<br>
screen, if a user selected 10.0.0.5, then the updated display would show only packets<br>
between 10.0.0.12 and 10.0.0.5. A user could also further qualify the dump by selecting<br>
ports. Various options for dumping packets can be applied by selecting a type of dump<br>
from the selections 2404 at the top of the screen display.<br>
Selection of the "Recommend" button 2206 in the buttons frame 2250 of Fig. 22<br>
results in the display of real-time capacity or bandwidth recommendations for the network.<br>
Upon detection of selection of the "Recommended" button 2206, the network monitor uses<br>
a mathematical model to interpret the data being viewed by the user to provide<br>
recommendations on bandwidth usage by an application (or other types of traffic) or on<br>
setting of link/switch capacity to obtain a specific quality of service. Several such<br>
statistics 2502 are shown in Fig. 25. A user may enter desired quality of service values<br>
such as loss rates and maximum delays to obtain recommendations on the capacity<br>
required to support the desired quality of service for the type of traffic analyzed. Figs. 25<br>
and 26 illustrate the recommendations which can be provided.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the user may select a particular application and a<br>
"busy-period" for which she wants to "size" the network resources for a particular quality<br>
of service level. Appropriate subroutines in the network monitor then analyze the<br>
particular application traffic and extract or estimate "model parameters". Using the<br>
mathematical model, and estimates of the parameters, as well as parameters of quality of<br>
service (such as packet loss rates, network delays, frame rates, etc.) the model computes<br>
statistics such as statistical multiplexing gains, capacity requirements, and buffer<br>
allocations and provides the user with optimal recommendations of switch/router<br>
configurations, network resources, or server parameters to maximize network utilization<br>
while meeting the quality of service requirements. Such recommendations can be<br>
computed on a real-time basis where the statistic is updated for every packet or a set of<br>
packets belonging to different services and feedback can be provided to network elements<br>
along the path for each flow on optimal configurations to enable dynamic resource<br>
allocation to meet service quality requirements.<br>
The x-axis 2602 of the graph represents the number of users and the y-axis 2604<br>
represents capacity in bits/second. For a desired number of users, the capacity can be read<br>
off the chart or from a display of corresponding tabular results. Fig. 27 illustrates a<br>
display similar to that in Fig. 22 for the case where the Do DNS button was selected so the<br>
IP addresses are resolved to their registered names.<br>
Fig. 28 is a display showing statistics that are displayed upon selection of the<br>
"Statistics" button 2208 in the buttons frame 2250 in Fig. 22. Upon selection of the<br>
"statistics" button 2208, the network monitor computes various statistics based on data<br>
currently being viewed by the user. Exemplary statistics include packet size distributions,<br>
protocol distributions, bandwidth usage per client, bandwidth usage by domain, average<br>
response time per server, average round-trip time between server-client pair, and<br>
performance metrics.<br>
The present invention is not limited to a particular division of functions between<br>
the host computer and the interface computer. The functions of the host computer and the<br>
interface computer may be performed by a single computer. Interface with a network<br>
monitor according to the present invention is not limited to the user interface and may be<br>
via the network being monitored or another communication line.<br>
Although illustrated and described above with reference to certain specific<br>
embodiments, the present invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details<br>
shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and<br>
range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
