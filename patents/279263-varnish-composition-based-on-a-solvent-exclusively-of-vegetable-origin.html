				<td>The present invention relates to a varnish composition for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use, produced using solvents of natural origin. These solvents are acetates, carbonates or ethers prepared from the same natural molecule and have a vapour tension that is less than ethyl, propyl or butyl acetates. This property induces a lesser emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) .<br>
A ministerial order dated 1st March 1993 considers any compound which, with the exclusion of methane, contains carbon and hydrogen (which may be substituted with other atoms such as halogens, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen or phosphorus, with the exception of carbon oxides and of carbonates) , and which is in the gaseous or vapour state under normal temperature and pressure conditions, to be a volatile organic compound (VOC).<br>
European Directive 1999/13/EC completes this definition and adds that any organic product having a vapour pressure of greater than 10 Pa (approximately 0.075 mmHg) is considered to be a VOC.<br>
In the United States, the vapour tension threshold selected is much lower, namely 0.13 Pa (approximately 0.001 mmHg) under normal conditions. In Australia, VOCs are defined as chemical compounds having a vapour pressure of greater than 27 Pa at 25°C.<br>
Among VOCs, mention may in particular be made, without this list being exhaustive, of solvents, degreasing agents, dissolving agents, preserving agents, cleaning agents and dispersing agents. The legislations, although variable according to country, all tend towards a reduction in the emission of these VOCs.<br>
In France, the regulations have been modified in order<br>
to take into account the requirements derived from European Directive 1999/13/EC of 11 March 1999 relating to the reduction of VOC emissions due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations.<br>
Consequently, it is essential to find cosmetic compositions which have limited VOC levels.<br>
The molecules presented in Table 1 have a vapour tension that is substantially lower than the vapour tensions of the solvents normally used in nail varnishes, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate.<br>
In order to clearly and vigorously evaluate the reduction in VOC emission brought about by the use of novel solvents of natural origin, the study was based on a model published in 2002 by the ADEME [French Environmental and Energy Control Agency) in the report titled "VOC emissions in the paint, varnish, printing ink, glue and adhesive production sector". The model used, the Clements model, makes it possible to calculate the VOC emissions engendered by surface evaporation during the production of a varnish in an open tank.<br>
The emissions of each solvent present in a varnish composition are calculated by the equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where:<br>
Ei is the emission of the species i in kg per year,<br>
Mi is the molecular mass of the species i in g/mol,<br>
Ki is the mass transfer coefficient of the species i in<br>
m.s-1, from the liquid phase to the gas phase,<br>
Pi is the vapour pressure of the species i in kPa,<br>
- 3 -<br>
Hr  is  the duration  in hours  of  the manufacturing<br>
operation,<br>
A is the free surface area of the tank in m2,<br>
R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J.K-1.mol-1) ,<br>
T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and<br>
N is the number of identical manufacturing operations<br>
in the year.<br>
The coefficient of transfer of the species i to the gas<br>
phase (Ki) can be determined by the equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
<br>
where:<br>
Ki is expressed in m.s-1,<br>
V is the speed of the air above the tank in m.s-1,<br>
Mi is the molar mass of the species i in g.mol-1.<br>

25  The term "fusel oil", of German origin, translates as<br>
"lower alcohol or alcohol of poor quality". Today, this term denotes all higher alcohols obtained at various stages of fermentation. The compounds of fusel oil can be classified in two major groups (PATIL A.G.S.M. et al. International Sugar Journal, (2002), 104, 51-54, 56-58) :<br>
the high boiling fraction (HBF) , Bp &gt; 132°C. It represents only 1 to 5% of fusel oil. The constituents of this fraction can be classified in three groups (SHORUIGIN, P. Pet al. Her. (1933). 66B: 1087-1093; SHORUIGIN, PP et al., Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii (1934), 4 372-394) :<br>
o  acidic  compounds  (10-25%):  higher  alcohols (hexanol,  heptanol,  octanol,  nonanol),  fatty acids  (butyric,  valeric,  caproic,  caprylic, pelargonic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic) and esters thereof (acetates, butyrates), o basic  compounds   (5-10%):   di-,   tri-  and<br>
tetramethylpyrazines, and o  neutral compounds (60-80%): terpenes; the low boiling fraction (LBF), Bp 
Table 2 hereinafter presents some compositions of the LBF fraction of fusel oil.<br>
Table 2<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
<br>
<br>
The percentages   of each alcohol vary greatly according<br>
to the starting  material used for the fermentation, but<br>
also according    to the method of fermentation or of distillation.<br>
Fusel oil is a relatively viscous liquid that is straw yellow to dark red in colour and has an unpleasant odour. Before the development of processes of chemical synthesis, fusel oil was the only commercial source of amyl alcohols.<br>
Subsequent to the production of 1000 1 of alcohol, between 1 and 11 1 of fusel oil can be obtained. This percentage depends on the starting material used and on the fermentation and distillation conditions, as illustrated in Table 3 below.<br>
Table 3:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
<br>
The uses of fusel oil are quite diverse and have changed a great deal over the years. Before the 1930s, fusel oil was used only as a source of amyl alcohols. Around 1935, several studies begin to refer to the use of fusel oil or of its derivatives as solvents for paints, lacquers and nitrocellulose (MAKING Z. et al., JP 111027; TING H.W. Research Inst. Ann. Kept. Bur. Chem. (1936), 3, 75; CAVALIE H.R. et al., FR988540) . However, the vast majority of authors were studying the distillation and purification of this distillation residue.<br>
Koslov et al.  (Zhurnal Prikladnoi Khimii,  (1954), 27,<br>
223-225) used fusel oil as a flotation agent for copper and zinc ores.<br>
Gukasyan et al. (Tsvetnye Metallyst, (1979), 12, 61-62)<br>
used fusel oil in place of trioctylamine for extracting<br>
rhenium from solutions thereof. Other authors made use<br>
of fusel oil phosphates for extracting thallium(III)<br>
(SRIVASTAVA  T.N.  et  al.  Ladbev  Part  A:  Physical<br>
Sciences,  (1971),  9,  (34),  178-182),  titanium(IV)<br>
(HASAN S.H. et al., Asian Journal of Chemistry, (1993),<br>
5(2),  266-277)  or zirconium(IV)  (HASAN S.H.  et al.,<br>
Acta Chimica Hungaria, (1990), 127(2), 235-245).<br>
Amyl alcohols are more liposoluble than propyl and butyl alcohols, and therefore fusel oil quickly found its place as an additive for petroleum products and hydraulic fluids. It was often used in mixtures of fuels for diesel engines for agricultural use (GORMAN J.W., US4585461; ZHANG G.M. CN 1068844; KARAOSMANOGLU F. et al., Energy Sources (1997), 19(6), 567-577).<br>
Fusel oil esters can be used industrially as plasticizers (GHUIBA F.M. et al., Indian Journal of Technology, (1985), 23(8), 309-311), lubricants (OZGULSUN A. et al., Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, (2000), 77(1), 105-109, extracting agents and flavourings (WELSCH F.W. et al., Journal of Food Science (1989), 54(6), 1565-1568; YOSHIDA N. JP 01030647; ADNAN A. et al., Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research (1994), 37(11), 449-452) or emulsifiers (LOU Y., CN 1053085).<br>
Recently, several Russian researchers have studied the use of the acetates derived from starch fusel oil as a solvent for industrial coatings or as a dissolving agent for nail varnishes (RU 2 174 974; KORYSTIN S.I. et al., Tekhnika Mashinostroenyia (2002), 6 98-104; RU 2 194 492) .<br>
None of these documents discloses the use of a solvent of plant origin as a solvent for preparing nail varnishes.<br>
Now, the inventors have discovered that solvents of plant origin, in particular esterified fusel oil, can be used as a solvent in varnish preparation, and make it possible to obtain varnishes that are easy to apply, for which the drying time is of the order of 2 to 4 minutes and which exhibit good elasticity.<br>
The subject of the present invention is therefore a varnish composition for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use, characterized in that it comprises one or more solvent(s) exclusively of plant origin.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the solvent is composed of one or more fusel oil derivatives chosen from the group comprising fusel oil acetates (esterified fusel oil), fusel oil carbonates, fusel oil ethers or isovalerates. In the present application, all these compounds will be called "fusel oil derivatives".<br>
According to the present invention, the fusel oil used is a mixture of C1-C5, preferably C2-C5, alcohols, containing:<br>
0 to 95%,  advantageously 30 to 90%,  even more advantageously 50 to 80%, of 3-methyl-l-butanol, 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 5 to 15%, of a mixture of 1-propanol and of 2-propanol, and 2 to 63%, advantageously 10 to 20%, of a mixture of 1-butanol and of 2-methyl-l-propanol; or containing:<br>
0 to 100%, advantageously 30 to 90%, even more advantageously 60 to 80%, of 3-methyl-l-butanol, 0 to 50%, advantageously 5 to 20%, of a mixture of 1-butanol and of 2-methyl-l-propanol, and<br>
0  to  20%  of  a mixture  of  1-propanol  and of<br>
2-propanol,<br>
0 to 20% of ethanol, and<br>
0  to  20%,  advantageously  0  to  5%,  even more<br>
advantageously less than 1%, of water.<br>
In the context of the invention, it is possible to carry out, using fusel oil, various types of reactions in order to obtain:<br>
acetates by esterification, in particular acetates chosen from the group comprising isoamyl, butyl, isobutyl, propyl, isopropyl and ethyl acetates, carbonates  by  transesterification  of  dimethyl carbonate  (DMC), in particular carbonates chosen from  the   group   comprising  methyl   isoamyl carbonate, methyl butyl carbonate, methyl isobutyl carbonate,   methyl   propyl   carbonate,   methyl isopropyl carbonate and methyl ethyl carbonate, ethers by etherification,  in particular ethers chosen from the group comprising isoamyl ethyl ether, isobutyl ethyl ether, butyl ethyl ether, propyl ethyl ether and isopropyl ethyl ether, isovalerates   by   esterifying   oxidation,   in particular methyl or ethyl isovalerates.<br>
For each of these reactions, the reaction medium obtained after separation of the catalysts can be distilled in order to obtain a single molecule. It can also be used as it is, i.e. as a mixture of several molecules of the same family.<br>
In the case of complete purification, the invention makes it possible to form, from the fusel oil:<br>
isoamyl acetate in the case of an esterification,<br>
methyl  isoamyl  carbonate  in  the  case  of  a<br>
transesterification,<br>
isoamyl   ethyl   ether   in   the   case   of  an<br>
etherification,<br>
methyl  3-methylbutanoate  or  ethyl  3-methyl-<br>
butanoate, also called methyl or ethyl isovalerates, in the case of an oxidation followed by an esterification, depending on the solvent in which the reaction is carried out: methanol or ethanol.<br>
If a partial distillation, or advantageously no distillation, is carried out after reaction, the invention makes it possible to form, from the fusel oil:<br>
a mixture of acetates in the case of an esterification, the composition of which is:<br>
• 0 to 100%,  advantageously 30 to 90%,  even more  advantageously  50  to  80%,  of  isoamyl acetate,<br>

In the context of the present invention, each of the molecules can be used pure, as a mixture with other molecules of the same family, as a mixture with other families of molecules synthesized from fusel oil, or alternatively as a mixture with other solvents of<br>
-natural origin.<br>
The fusel oil used in the context of the invention can also be used in esterified form and comprising a mixture of C3-C7 acetate containing:<br>

0.5 to 20%, advantageously 5 to 15%, of a mixture of n-propyl acetate and of isopropyl acetate, and 2 to 63%, advantageously 10 to 20%, of a mixture of n-butyl acetate and of isobutyl acetate.<br>

Examples 6 to 11 illustrate varnish formulations in<br>
which the solvent(s) is (are) exclusively of natural<br>
origin and derived from fusel oil.<br>
The  various  varnishes  are  prepared  by  techniques<br>
conventionally used in the field.<br>
Example 1: Identification of the fusel oil components<br>

Table 4: Fusel oil compositions (% by weight)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
<br>
* The remainder of the fusel oil being essentially water.<br>
Example   2:   Synthesis   of   isoamyl esterification of the fusel oil<br>
acetate<br>
by<br>
The  fusel  oil  is  esterified  with  acetic  acid<br>
(stoichiometric amounts), in the presence of a highly<br>
acidic ion exchange resin Amberlyst® 15 (2% relative to<br>
the total mass) . The mixture is heated at 70°C for 2 h<br>
so as to form a mixture of acetates. The residue is<br>
filtered so as to be regenerated and the reaction<br>
medium is distilled so as to obtain the isoamyl acetate<br>
(Bp: 131°C) in the form of a colourless liquid with a<br>
fruity smell.<br>
Example 3 : Synthesis of isoamyl carbonate by transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with fusel oil<br>
The synthesis of isoamyl methyl carbonate is carried out with an excess of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) . The fusel oil is added to 5 equivalents of DMC and the reaction is catalyzed by potassium carbonate K2CO3. Heating of the reaction medium at 100°C for 1 h results in a 75% conversion rate of the fusel oil with a 95% selectivity for methyl isoamyl carbonate. The mixture<br>
is filtered so as to recover the catalyst and then purified by distillation so as to obtain the desired fraction. Total purification produces the isoamyl methyl carbonate (Bp: 151-152°C) in the form of a colourless liquid with a fruity smell.<br>
Example 4: Synthesis of isoamyl ethyl ether by etherification<br>
Isoamyl ethyl ether is formed by nucleophilic substitution of the isoamyl alcohol contained in the fusel oil onto iodoethane, according to a Williamson reaction. The synthesis is carried out without solvent, at ambient temperature, by mixing isoamyl alcohol, iodoethane and potassium hydroxide in stoichiometric proportions. A catalytic amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG 300) is used as phase transfer catalyst. After stirring for 4 h, all the iodoethane has been consumed and the isoamyl alcohol conversion rate reaches 94%. Filtration of the potassium iodide formed and then distillation at atmospheric pressure makes it possible to obtain the isoamyl ethyl ether (Bp: 103-104°C) in the form of a colourless liquid with a fruity smell.<br>

10  Evaluation of the ease of application of the films<br>
The reference 056 and the formulations according to the invention were applied, using a Touzart-Matignon applicator, onto contrast cards, as wet films 150 µm<br>
thick.<br>
Drying time<br>
The measurements of the drying time of the formulations mentioned in the examples were carried out with a drying time device, on a film of 100 µm, at a constant temperature of 20°C.<br>
All the films exhibit a drying time similar to that of the reference time, which is 3 minutes.<br>
Evaluation of the VOC emissions<br>
The parameters taken into account for calculating the VOC emissions are as follows:<br>
exposure time, i.e. the time necessary to carry<br>
out the mixing of the various components of the<br>
varnish: 3 h,<br>
number of formulations produced in 1 year: 300,<br>
mean ambient temperature: 20°C,<br>
speed of the air above the tank: 0.05 m/s,<br>
tank diameter:  1.80 m,  which corresponds to a<br>
500 1 tank.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
<br>
All the formulations according to the invention exhibit a VOC emission reduced by at least 50% relative to the 5  reference formulation.<br>
