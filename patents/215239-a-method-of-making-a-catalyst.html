				<td>The present invention relates to a method of making a catalyst. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the manufacture of a VSbOx based catalyst useful in the ammoxidation of a C3-C5 paraffinic hydrocarbon to its corresponding a, B-unsaturated nitrile ammoxidation of propylene with NH3 and oxygen to accylonitrile, ammoxidation of methylpyridine with NH3 and oxygen to make cyanopyridine, the amooxidation of m-xylene with NH3 and oxygen to make isophthalonitrile and the oxidation of o-xylene to make phthalic anhydride. In particular, the present invention is directed to a process for the manufacture of VSbOx based catalyst (preferably promoted with other metals) useful in the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile.<br>
Great Britain Patent Nos. 1,336,135 and 1,336,136 disclose making catalyst from V2O5  and Sb205  slurries that are mixed, dried and calcined.  These catalysts are used to ammoxidize alkanes such as propane.  U.S. Patent No. 3,860,534 has similar disclosures but uses calcined catalyst washed with water before use to remove soluble vanadium compounds.  The dried and calcined material in the above references are relatively weak and have low abrasion resistance.  More importantly, the material in the dried state is a fine talcum powder-like material not possible to spray dry to obtain microspheroidal particles large enough for a fluid bed catalyst.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,784,979; 4,879,264 and 5,094,989, assigned to the assignee of the instant application, are directed to the specific procedure for the preparation of VSbOx based catalyst (promoted with other metals) useful in the fluid bed reactors for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile.  While the processes disclosed in these patents produces good ammoxidation catalyst for use in the fluid bed process, they may be improved upon.  The present invention is directed to such an improvement.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention comprises a method of making a VSbOx based catalyst suitable for the ammoxidation of propane to acrylonitrile.  In particular, the process of the present invention comprises preparing a catalyst having the following formula:<br>
where  A  =  Sn, Ti  or mixtures thereof,<br>
D =  at least one element selected from Li, Mg, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Fe, Cr, Ga, Ni, Zn, Ge, Nb, Mo, W, Cu, Ti, Ta, Se, Bi, Ce, In, As, B, Al, and Mn, and wherein  m  =  0.5 to 10 a  =  0 to 10<br>
d  =  0 to 10<br>
x  =  number of oxygen atoms necessary to satisfy the valency requirements of the other elements,<br>
by reacting a V0(02) +  ion while in aqueous solution with a first portion of an  Sb  compound containing Sb  in the valence state of 3+, thereby reducing the average valence of the V ion to less than 5+ and oxidizing Sb  to a valence state of 5+, removing the water from the solution to form a dried catalyst precursor, calcining the resulting dried precursor at a maximum temperature in the range of 650° to 950°C wherein the improvement comprises adding at least a second portion of an Sb  compound after the first portion has at least partially reacted with the V0(02) +  ion.<br>
Preferably, the calcination of the catalyst precursor is done at a temperature of between 700° to 875°C, most preferably in the range of 750° to 850°C.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the water is removed by spray drying at a temperature of between 110° to 190°C, especially preferred being 115° to 175°C, providing particles that are microspheroidal in shape in the range of 10 to 200}j., especially preferred being 25 to 150^1.<br>
The V compound reacted in the process of the present invention can be an inorganic or an organic compound of V, but is usually an inorganic compound.  A partial list of such compounds includes any oxide of V such as V2O5, V7013, VO, V02, etc.  For a more detailed list of typical compounds<br>
utilized in the practice of the present invention, see U.S. Patents 4,784,979 and 4,879,264, herein incorporated by reference.  The preferred V compound used in the reaction with the hydrogen peroxide is one of the oxides, preferably because of cost,  V205 is the compound of choice.  Antimony compound reactants chosen to react with the VO(02)+  in making the catalyst of the present invention are also set forth in detail in U.S. Patents 4,784,979 and 4,879,264, herein incorporated by reference.  A partial list of these compounds includes such Sb oxides such as Sb203 and Sb204  and antimony halides such as  SbBr3, and SbCl3.  Other antimony compounds suitable for addition to the catalyst are the reaction product of Sb203 refluxed with nitric acid, antimony oxide sol, antimony metal and the hydrolysis product of the reaction of Sb203, SbCl3 and SbCls with water or mixtures thereof.<br>
Optionally, the catalyst prepared by the present invention may be activated by contacting the catalyst with an hydroxy compound in liquid form and thereafter drying the catalyst.  The particular hydroxy compound selected is typically isobutanol, cyclohexanol, cyclopenthanol, etc.  For specifics as to the activation procedure suitable for the process of the present invention, see U.S. Patent 5,094,989 assigned to the assignee of the present invention, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The examples set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and provide a detailed description of the process of the present invention.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A<br>
A catalyst having the composition VSbi.4Sn0.2Tio.iOx was prepared by mixing 27.28g of V205  powder with a solution consisting of 100ml of 30%  H202  in 900ml of water in a two liter beaker.  After reaction of the V205 powder was complete, 61.22g of  Sb2O3 was added followed by 2.40g of  TiO2 powder (Degussa P-25).  The beaker was covered with a watch glass and the mixture was stirred and heated for about three hours.  99.25g of 9.11wt%  Sn02  sol (Nalco Chemical Co.) were added to the foregoing dispersion.  The mixture was stirred in an uncovered beaker with heating in order to reduce the volume by evaporation of water.  When the mixture could no longer be stirred, it was dried in an oven at 120°C.  Thereafter, it was calcined for 8 hours at 650°C/ cooled and then crushed and sieved and the 20-35 mesh particles collected.  A portion of this was calcined for 3 hours at 810°C, then at 650°C for an additional 3 hours.<br>
The calcined catalyst was then contacted with isobutanol using about 6.25ml of isobutanol per gram of catalyst by placing the catalyst in a coarse glass frit funnel, pouring the isobutanol over the catalyst, stirring the catalyst in the isobutanol in order to spread the catalyst evenly over the<br><br>
bottom of the funnel, then allowing the isobutanol to pass through the funnel without suction.  This washing was done a total of three times.  After the last of the isobutanol was passed through the funnel, the catalyst was heated in an oven at 120°C to remove the residual isobutanol on the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst was used to ammoxidize propane using a 3/8 inch O.D. titanium metal fixed bed reactor equipped with a preheat leg and immersed in a temperature controlled molten salt bath at 480°C.  The feed to the reactor consisted of propane, ammonia, oxygen, nitrogen, and water in the ratio of 3/1.2/3/10/2.  The results are shown in Table I, below.<br>

The mixture was stirred in an uncovered beaker with heating in order to reduce the volume by evaporation of water.  When the mixture could no longer be stirred, it was dried in an oven at 120°C.  Thereafter, it was calcined for 8 hours at 650°C, cooled and then crushed and sieved and the 20-35 mesh particles collected.  A portion of this was calcined for 3 hours at 810°C then at 650°C for an additional 3 hours.<br>
The calcined catalyst was then contacted with isobutanol using about 6.25ml of isobutanol per gram of catalyst by placing the catalyst in a coarse glass frit funnel, pouring the isobutanol over the catalyst, stirring the catalyst in the isobutanol in order to spread the catalyst evenly over the<br><br>
bottom of the funnel, then allowing the isobutanol to pass through the funnel without suction.  This washing was done a total of three times.  After the last of the isobutanol was passed through the funnel, the catalyst was heated in an oven at 120°C to remove the residual isobutanol on the catalyst.<br>
