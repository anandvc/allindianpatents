COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION <br>
COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR BLEACHING A SUBSTRATE<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR BLEACHING A SUBSTRATE<br>
This invention relates to compositions and methods for catajytically bleaching substrates with atmospheric oxygen.<br>
Peroxygen bleaches are well known for their ability to remove stains from substrates. Traditionally, the substrate is subjected to hydrogen peroxide, or to substances which can generate hydroperoxyl radicals, such as inorganic or organic peroxides. Generally, these systems must be activated. One method of activation is to employ wash temperatures of 60Â°C or higher. However, these high temperatures often lead to inefficient cleaning, and can also cause premature damage to the substrate.<br>
A preferred approach to generating hydroperoxyl bleach radicals is the use of inorganic peroxides coupled with organic precursor compounds. These systems are employed for many commercial laundry powders. For example, various European systems are based on tetraacetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate, whereas in the United States laundry bleach products are typically based on sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (SNOBS) as the organic precursor coupled with sodium perborate.<br>
Precursor systems are generally effective but still exhibit several disadvantages. For example,oganic precursors are moderately sophisticated molecules requiring multi-step manufacturing processes resulting in high capital costs. Also, precursor systems have large formulation space requirements so that a significant proportion of a laundry powder must be devoted to the bleach components, leaving less room for other active ingredients and complicating the development of concentrated powders. Moreover, precursor systems do not bleach very efficiently in countries where consumers have<br><br>
WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br><br>
wash habits entailing low dosage, short wash times, cold temperatures and low wash liquor to substrate ratios.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, hydrogen peroxide and peroxy systems, can be activated 5     by bleach catalysts, such as by complexes of iron and the ligand N4Py (i. e. N. N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-bis(pyridin-2-yl)methylamine) disclosed in W095/34628. or the ligand Tpen (i.e. N, N, N\ N"-tetra(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)ethylenediamine) disclosed in W097/48787. According to these publications, molecular oxygen may be used as the oxidant as an alternative to peroxide generating systems. However, no role in catalysing 10     bleaching by atmospheric oxygen in an aqueous medium is reported.<br>
It has long been thought desirable to be able to use atmospheric oxygen (air) as the source for a bleaching species, as this would avoid the need for costly hydroperoxyl generating systems. Unfortunately, air as such is kinetically inert towards bleaching<br>
15     substrates and exhibits no bleaching ability. Recently some progress has been made in this area. For example, WO 97/38074 reports the use of air for oxidising stains on fabrics" by bubbling air through an aqueous solution containing an aldehyde and a radical initiator. A broad range of aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes is reported to be useful, particularly para-substituted aldehydes such as 4-methyl-, 4-ethyl- and 4-<br>
20     isopropyl benzaldehyde, whereas the range of initiators disclosed includes N-<br>
hydroxysuccinimide, various peroxides and transition metal coordination complexes.<br>
However, although this system employs molecular oxygen from the air, the aldehyde component and radical initiators such as peroxides are consumed during the bleaching 25     process. These components must therefore be included in the composition in relatively high amounts so as not to become depleted before completion of the bleaching process in the wash cycle. Moreover, the spent components represent a waste of resources as they can no longer participate in the bleaching process.<br>
30     Accordingly, it would be desirable to be able to provide a bleaching system based on atmospheric oxygen or air that does not rely primarily on hydrogen peroxide or a<br><br>
  WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br>
hydroperoxyl generating system, and that does not require the presence of organic components such as aldehydes that are consumed in the process. Moreover, it would be desirable to provide such a bleaching system that is effective in aqueous medium.<br>
5     We have surprisingly found that the long held wish to use atmospheric oxygen or air for bleaching substrates can be fulfilled without the attendant disadvantages referred to above. This has now been achieved by means of an organic substance that catalyses bleaching of the substrate by atmospheric oxygen, using the composition and method in accordance with the present invention.<br>
10<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a bleaching composition comprising, in an aqueous medium, atmospheric oxygen and an organic substance which forms a complex with a transition metal, the complex catalysing bleaching of a substrate by the atmospheric oxygen, wherein the aqueous medium is substantially<br>
15     devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system. The medium is therefore preferably insensitive or stable to catalase, which acts on peroxy species,<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of bleaching a substrate 20     comprising applying to the substrate, in an aqueous medium, an organic substance<br>
which forms a complex with a transition metal, the complex catalysing bleaching of the substrate by atmospheric oxygen.<br>
Furthermore, in a third aspect, the present invention provides the use of an organic 25     substance which forms a complex with a transition metal as a catalytic bleaching agent for a substrate in an aqueous medium substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or -generating bleach system, the complex catalysing bleaching of the substrate by the atmospheric oxygen.<br>
30     Advantageously, the method according to the present invention permits all or the<br>
majority of the bleaching species in the medium (on an equivalent weight basis) to be<br><br>
WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br><br>
derived from atmospheric oxygen. Thus, the medium can be made wholly or substantially devoid of peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or generating bleach system. Furthermore, the organic substance is a catalyst for the bleaching process and, as such, is not consumed but can continue to participate in the bleaching process. The 5     catalytically activated bleaching system of the type in accordance with the present invention, which is based on atmospheric oxygen, is therefore both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.<br>
Moreover, the bleaching system is operable under unfavourable wash conditions which 10     include low temperatures, short contact times and low dosage requirements.<br>
Furthermore, the method is effective in an aqueous medium and is therefore particularly applicable to bleaching of laundry fabrics. Therefore, whilst the composition and method according to the present invention may be used for bleaching any suitable 15     substrate, the preferred substrate is a laundry fabric.<br>
The bleaching method may be carried out by simply leaving the substrate in contact with the medium for a sufficient period of time. Preferably, however, the aqueous medium on or containing the substrate is agitated.<br>
20<br>
The organic substance may comprise a preformed complex of a ligand and a transition metal. Alternatively, the organic substance may comprise a free ligand that complexes with a transition metal already present in the water or that complexes with a transition metal present in the substrate. The organic substance may also be included in the form<br>
25     of a composition of a free ligand or a transition metal-substitutable metal-ligand<br>
complex, and a source of transition metal, whereby the complex is formed in situ in the medium.   "<br>
The organic substance forms a complex with one or more transition metals, in the latter 30     case for example as a dinuclear complex. Suitable transition metals include for<br>
example: manganese in oxidation states II-V, iron I-IV, copper I-III, cobalt I-III, nickel<br><br>

The ligands of formula (E) may be used in the form of complexes with an appropriate metal or, in some cases, in non-complexed form. In the non-complexed form, they rely<br>
20     upon complexing with a metal supplied in the form of a separate ingredient in the<br>
composition, specifically provided for supplying that metal, or upon complexing with a metal found as a trace element in tap water. However, where the ligand alone or in complex form carries a (positive) charge, a counter anion is necessary. The ligand or complex may be formed as a neutral species but it is often advantageous, for reasons of<br>
25     stability or ease of synthesis, to have a charged species with appropriate anion.<br>
Therefore, in an alternative fourth embodiment, the ligand of formula (E) is ion-paired with a counter ion, which ion-pairing is denoted by formula (F):<br><br><br>

The bleaching compositions according to the present invention may be used for laundry<br>
20     cleaning, hard surfaces cleaning (including cleaning of lavatories, kitchen work surfaces, floors, mechanical ware washing etc.). As is generally known in the art, bleaching compositions are also employed waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching during the manufacture of paper, leather manufacture, dye transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in oral hygiene preparations and/or contact<br>
25     lens disinfection. In the context of the present invention bleaching should be<br>
understood as relating generally to the decolonisation of stains or of other materials<br><br>
attached to or associated with a substrate. However, it is envisaged that the present invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesirable components attached to 30     or otherwise associated with a substrate.<br><br>
WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the organic substance is such that the in-use level is from l ÂµM to 50mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 10 to 100 ÂµM. Higher levels may be desired and applied in industrial bleaching processes, such as textile and paper pulp bleaching 5<br>
Preferably, the aqueous medium has a pH in the range from pH 6 to 13, more preferably from pH 6 to 11, still more preferably from pH 8 to 11. and most preferably from pH 8 to 10, in particular from pH 9 to 10.<br>
10     The bleaching composition of the present invention has particular application in detergent formulations, especially for laundry cleaning. Accordingly, in another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a detergent bleach composition comprising a bleaching composition as defined above and additionally a surface-active material, optionally together with detergency builder.<br>
15<br>
The bleach composition according to the present invention may for example contain a surfacejactive material in an amount of from 10 to 50% by weight The surface-active material may be naturally derived, such as soap, or a synthetic material selected from anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic actives and mixtures thereof.<br>
20     Many suitable actives are commercially available and are fully described in the<br>
literature, for example in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
Typical synthetic anionic surface-actives are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of 25     organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl groups containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term "alkyl" being used to include the alkyl portion of higher aryl groups. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and ammonium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher (C8-C18) alcohols produced, for example, from tallow or coconut oil; sodium and ammonium 30     alkyl (C9-C20) benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl (C10-C15) benzene sulphonates; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil fatty acid monoglyceride<br><br>

Examples of suitable nonionic surface-active compounds which may be used, preferably 15     together with the anionic surface-active compounds, include, in particular, the reaction products of alkylene oxides, usually ethylene oxide, with alkyl (C6-C22) phenols, generally"5-25 EO, ie. 5-25 units of ethylene oxides per molecule; and the condensation products of aliphatic (C8-C18) primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 2-30 EO. Other so-called nonionic surface-actives include 20    alkyl polyglycosides, sugar esters, long-chain tertiary amine oxides, long-chain tertiary phosphine oxides and dialkyl sulphoxides.<br>
Amphoteric or zwitterionic surface-active compounds can also be used in the compositions of the invention but this is not normally desired owing to their relatively 25     high cost. If any amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds are used, it is<br>
generally in small amounts in compositions based on the much more commonly used synthetic anionic and nonionic actives.<br>
The detergent bleach composition of the invention will preferably comprise from 1 to 15 30     % wt of anionic surfactant and from 10 to 40 % by weight of nonionic surfactant. In a<br><br>
WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br>
further preferred embodiment, the detergent active system is free from C16-C12 fatty acid soaps.<br>
The bleach composition of the present invention may also contains a detergency builder, 5     for example in an amount of from about 5 to 80 % by weight, preferably from about 10 to 60 % by weight<br>
Builder materials may be selected from 1) calcium sequestrant materials, 2) precipitating materials, 3) calcium ion-exchange materials and 4) mixtures thereof.<br>
10<br>
Examples of calcium sequestrant builder materials include alkali metal polyphosphates, such as sodium tripolyphosphate; nitrilotriacetic acid and its water-soluble salts; the alkali metal salts of carboxymethyioxy succinic acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, mellitic acid, benzene polycarboxylic acids, citric acid; and<br>
15     polyacetal carboxylates as disclosed in US-A-4,144.226 and US-A-4,146,495.<br>
Example"s of precipitating builder materials include sodium orthophosphate and sodium carbonate.<br>
20     Examples of calcium ion-exchange builder materials include the various types of water-insoluble crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicates, of which zeolites are the best known representatives, e.g. zeolite A, zeolite B (also known as zeolite P), zeolite C, zeolite X, zeolite Y and also the zeolite P-type as described in EP-A-0,384,070.<br>
25     In particular, the compositions of the invention may contain any one of the organic and inorganic builder materials, though, for environmental reasons, phosphate builders are preferably omitted or only used in very small amounts. Typical builders usable in the present invention are, for example, sodium carbonate, calcite/carbonate, the sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium citrate, carboxymethyioxy malonate, carboxymethyioxy<br>

It is preferred that the composition contains not more than 5% by weight of a carbonate 5     builder, expressed as sodium carbonate, more preferably not more than 2.5 % by weight to substantially nil, if the composition pH lies in the lower alkaline region of up to 10.<br>
Apart from the components already mentioned, the bleach composition of the present invention can contain any of the conventional additives in amounts of which such<br>
10     materials are normally employed in fabric washing detergent compositions. Examples of these additives include buffers such as carbonates, lather boosters, such as alkanolamides, particularly the monoethanol amides derived from palmkemel fatty acids and coconut fatty acids; lather depressants, such as alkyl phosphates and silicones; anti-redeposition agents, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and alkyl or substituted<br>
15     alkyl cellulose ethers; stabilisers, such as phosphonic acid derivatives (i.e. DequestÂ® types); fabric softening agents; inorganic salts and alkaline buffering agents, such as sodium sulphate and sodium silicate; and, usually in very small amounts, fluorescent agents; perfumes; enzymes, such as proteases, cellulases, lipases, amylases and oxidases; germicides and colourants.<br>
20<br>
Transition metal sequestrants such as EDTA, and phosphonic acid derivatives such as EDTMP (ethylene diamine tetra(methylene phosphonate)) may also be included, in addition to the organic substance specified, for example to improve the stability sensitive ingredients such as enzymes, fluorescent agents and perfumes, but provided<br>
25     the composition remains bleaching effective. However, the composition according to the present invention containing the organic substance, is preferably substantially, and more preferably completely, devoid of transition metal sequestrants (other than the organic substance).<br>
30     Whilst the present invention is based on the catalytic bleaching of a substrate by atmospheric oxygen or air, it will be appreciated that small amounts of hydrogen<br><br>
WO 00/12667	PCT/GB99/02876<br><br>
peroxide or peroxy-based or -generating systems may be included in the composition, if desired. Preferably, however, the composition will be devoid of peroxygen bleach or peroxy-based or -generating bleach systems.<br>
