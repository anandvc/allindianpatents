				<td>The invention relates to novel substituted beta-carbolines, a process for their preparation and use thereof as pharmaceuticals.<br>
United States Patent 4,631,149 discloses beta-carbolines useful as antiviral, antibacterial and antitumor agents. United States Patent 5,604,236 discloses beta-carboline derivatives containing an acidic group, useful as thromboxane syntheses inhibitors.<br>
NFkB is a heterodimeric transcription factor which can activate a large number of genes which code, inter alia, for proinflammatory cytokines such as 1L-1, 11^2, TNFa or 11^6. NFkB is present in the cytosol of cells, building a comμLex with its naturally occurring inhibitor IkB. The stimulation of cells, for examμLe by cytokines, leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of DcB. This proteolytic degradation leads to the activation of NFkB, which subsequently migrates into the nucleus of the cell and there activates a large number of proinflammatory genes. In disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, Alzheimer"s disease or atherosclerosis, NFkB is activated beyond the normal extent. Inhibition of NFkB is also of benefit in cancer therapy, since it is emμLoyed there for the reinforcement of the cytostatic therapy. It was possible to show that pharmaceuticals such as glucocorticoids, salicylates or gold salts, which are emμLoyed in rheumatic therapy, intervene in an inhibitory manner at various points in the NFkB-activating signal chain or interfere directly with the transcription of the genes. The first step in the signal cascade mentioned is the degradation of DcB. This phosphorylation is regulated by die specific IkB kinase. To date, no inhibitors are known which specifically inhibit IkB kinase.<br>
In the attempt to obtain active compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, Alzheimer"s disease, carcinomatous disorders (potentiation of cytotoxic therapies) or atherosclerosis, it has now been found that the benzimidazoles according to the invention are strong and very specific inhibitors of IkB kinase.<br>
The invention therefore relates to the compounds of me formula I<br><br><br>
and/ora stereoisomeric form ofthe compounds ofthe formula Iand/ora physiologically<br>
tolerable salt ofthe compounds ofthe formula I,<br>
