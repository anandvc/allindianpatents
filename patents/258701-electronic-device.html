example as disclosed in JP-A-2001 -77568, an operational panel is disposed on the front of<br>
the instrument, and an operational button, a terminal for connecting a peripheral instrument<br>
and the like are provided on the operational panel. According to such an outward shape, a<br>
user can easily recognize a position of the operational button or the connection terminal,<br>
and easily use the button or terminal, and consequently improve operability of a device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an entertainment device or other electronic<br>
device having an outward shape improved in functionality compared with that in the<br>
related art.<br>
An electronic device according to the invention is characterized by having a main<br>
housing that is formed in an approximately elliptic cylinder form, and disposed in such a<br>
manner that a longitudinal direction is approximately horizontal to a setting surface, and<br>
has a medium insertion port for inserting a portable information storage medium, and an<br>
approximately boxlike base portion attached to a lower portion of the main housing.<br>
According to the electronic device according to the invention, the main housing is<br>
formed in the approximately elliptic cylinder form, and disposed in such a manner that the<br>
longitudinal direction of the housing (axial direction of the elliptic cylinder) is<br>
approximately horizontal to the setting surface. Therefore, even if it is accommodated in<br><br>
an accommodation rack such as an audio board, since a space is secured in an upper portion<br>
of the main housing, cooling efficiency of the electronic device is increased. As a result,<br>
functionality of the outward shape of the entertainment device is improved.<br>
Moreover, the base portion may be attached to the lower portion of the main<br>
housing in so as to be offset in at least one direction of the longitudinal direction and a<br>
lateral direction with respect to the main housing in a plane view. According to diis aspect,<br>
a space can also be secured in the lower portion of the main housing. The space is used,<br>
for example, for cooling of the electronic device or by wiring in the electronic device.<br>
The electronic device according to the another invention is characterized by<br>
having an insertion port formation surface portion in which a medium insertion port for<br>
inserting a portable information storage medium is formed, and a front board portion that is<br>
disposed at a place lower man the medium insertion port and spreads approximately<br>
horizontally on this side of at least the insertion port formation surface portion. The<br>
electronic device is, for example, an entertainment device such as a household game<br>
machine, and when the portable information storage medium is inserted therein,<br>
information is read out from the medium. In the invention, the front board portion is<br>
provided at a place lower than the medium insertion port for inserting the information<br>
storage medium, and the front board portion spreads on the front side (a side opposite to an<br>
insertion direction) of at least the medium insertion port. Therefore, when a user inserts<br>
the information storage medium into the medium insertion port, or removes the <br>
information storage medium from the medium insertion port, the medium is prevented<br>
from direcdy falling to the floor, and consequently an electronic device having an outward<br>
shape that is improved in functionality compared to mat in the related art is realized.<br>
When area of the front board portion is made larger man that of the information<br>
storage medium, falling of the information storage medium can be prevented more securely.<br>
Moreover, the information storage medium to be inserted into the medium insertion port or<br><br>
the information storage medium removed from the medium insertion port can be<br>
temporarily placed on the front board portion.<br>
Moreover, the electronic device may further have a cover covering a part or more<br>
of the front board portion. According to this aspect, accumulation of dust in the front<br>
board portion can be prevented. In addition, even if the information storage medium<br>
touches the front board portion, adhesion of dust to the medium is prevented.<br>
In this aspect, the cover may be supported in such a manner that it can move<br>
between a position of covering the part or more of the front board portion and a position of<br>
exposing the part or more of the portion.<br>
Moreover, the cover may cover the medium insertion port in addition to the part or<br>
more of the front board portion. According to this aspect, entering of dust from the<br>
medium insertion port into the electronic device can be prevented.<br>
Moreover, it is acceptable for the electronic device to be formed in such a manner<br>
that it can be placed both vertically and horizontally, and has a plurality of insertion port<br>
formation surface portions, the cover covers the front board portion disposed in the lower<br>
side of the medium insertion port formed in one of the plurality of insertion port formation<br>
surface portions; the plurality of insertion port formation surface portions are disposed in a<br>
manner of being arranged in a horizontal direction when the electronic device is placed<br>
horizontally, and arranged in a vertical direction when it is vertically placed; and the one of<br>
the plurality of insertion port formation surface portions is disposed to be situated at the <br>
lowest side when the electronic device is vertically placed. According to this aspect,<br>
when the electronic device is vertically placed, the front board portion<br>
being nearest to a setting surface where dust tends to fly most significantly is covered by<br>
the cover.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the invention is described in detail according to<br>
drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an electronic device according to the embodiment,<br>
Fig. 2 is a front view, Fig. 3 is a left side view, Fig. 4 is a right side view, Fig. 5 is a back<br>
view, Fig. 6 is a top view, and Fig. 7 is a bottom view. The electronic device can be placed<br>
both horizontally and vertically. The electronic device is configured by an approximately<br>
elliptical cylinder-like main housing 10 that is disposed horizontally in a horizontal<br>
placement condition of the electronic device, and an approximately boxlike base portion 52<br>
which is attached to a lower portion of the main housing 10. The base portion 52 supports<br><br>
the main housing 10 by sidewalk and the inside of the base portion 52 is communicated<br>
with the inside of the main housing 10. The main housing 10 is arranged in such a manner <br>
that a longitudinal direction of the housing is horizontal to a setting surface. An<br>
information processing device, an information storage device, various medium drive<br>
devices and the like of the electronic device are accommodated in one of the main housing<br>
10 and the base portion 52, or accommodated in and over the two, respectively. In<br>
particular, a rectangular circuit board and the like are efficiendy accommodated in the base<br>
portion 52.<br>
In the front of the base portion 52, a front skirt 64 is formed. The lower portion of<br>
the front skirt 64 overhangs to the front, so that beauty of the electronic device and stability<br>
when the electronic device is placed are improved. Moreover, a plurality of USB<br>
terminals 74 are provided above the front skirt 64, and in a right side of each of the USB<br>
terminals 74, a lamp 74a (for example, LED) is provided, which is turned on when the USB<br>
terminal 74 is operated. Therefore a user is notified of the USB terminal 74 being in<br>
operation. Moreover, the electronic device can charge an external device (for example, a<br>
controller having a battery set therein) connected to the USB terminal 74 during operation<br>
or sleep (on standby for operation). In addition, the lamp 74a is turned on in a color for<br>
notifying the user of an on-charge state when the battery is charging, and when the battery<br>
is fully charged, a lighting color of the lamp 74a is changed in order to notify the user of a<br>
fact that the battery has been fully charged.<br>
Lateral and longitudinal sizes of the base portion 52 are narrow compared with<br>
those of the main housing 10. The base portion 52 is attached in a such manner that a left<br>
side of the portion is approximately even witii a left side of the main housing 10.<br>
Therefore, the base portion 52 is provided in such a manner that a front face, right side face,<br>
and back face 109 of the portion are situated inside witii respect to edges of the main<br>
housing 10, respectively.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, a front-side overhanging portion 69 is provided in a<br>
front side of the main housing 10, so that when the user looks down the electronic device<br>
from above, they do not see the USB terminals 74. However, the front skirt 64 is formed<br>
on the base portion 52 as described before, and the user can insert a terminal of a peripheral<br>
device of the electronic device into the USB terminals 74 by viewing the front skirt 64.<br>
Furthermore, the front-side overhanging portion 69 is situated above a connection portion<br>
of the USB terminals 74 and thus protects the connection portion of the USB terminals 74.<br>
A back-side overhanging portion 71 is provided in a back side (back face side) of the main<br>
housing 10. As described later, various terminals for connection to the electronic device<br>
are also provided on a back face 109 of the base portion 52 and a back face 111 of the main<br>
housing 10. Connection portions for these terminals are protected by the back-side<br>
overhanging portion 71 of the main housing 10. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2, an<br>
overhanging portion 68 is provided in a right side of the main housing 10.<br>
The main housing 10 has a rectangular frame member 60 arranged horizontally to<br>
the setting surface. The frame member 60 has an appropriate thickness for securing<br>
stiffness of the electronic device. In a left edge portion of the frame member 60, an<br>
upper-left side plate 110 having a shape of an elliptic plate that has been cut along a<br>
longitudinal axis is attached in such a manner that the upper-left side plate 110 stands. Also,<br>
a lower-left side plate 112 similarly having a shape of an elliptical plate that has been cut<br>
along a longitudinal axis is attached in such a manner that the lower-left side plate 112 is<br>
suspended. Similarly in a right edge portion, an upper-right side plate 116 having a shape<br>
of an elliptical plate that has been cut along a longitudinal axis is attached in the standing<br>
manner, and a lower-right side plate 118 similarly having a shape of an elliptic plate that<br>
has been cut along a longitudinal axis is attached in the suspending manner.<br>
A curved platelike aluminum cover 56 is attached along curved upper edge<br>
portions of the upper-left side plate 110 and the upper right side plate 116, which covers a<br><br>
top of the electronic device 10. Moreover, a curved aluminum cover 108 is attached along<br>
curved lower edge portions of the lower-left side plate 112 and the lower-right side plate<br>
118, and the aluminum cover 108 and the base portion 52 cover a bottom of the main<br>
housing 10.<br>
Thus, the aluminum covers 56 and 108 comprise elliptical side panels of the main<br>
housing 10 in the approximately elliptical cylinder form, the upper-left side plate 110 and<br>
the lower-left side plate 112 comprise one end-face portion of the main housing 10, and the<br>
upper-right side plate 116 and the lower-right side plate 118 comprise another end-face<br>
portion. The aluminum covers 56 and 108 are curved respectively, thereby improving<br>
beauty of the main housing 10 and securing spaces outward in a radial direction of the main<br>
housing 10, that is, spaces above and below the main housing 10. This improves cooling<br>
efficiency of the electronic device. The aluminum covers 56 and 108, upper-left side plate<br>
110, lower-left side plate 112, upper-right side plate 116 and lower-right side plate 118 are<br>
formed, for example, by extrusion of aluminum.<br>
The main housing 10 has a shape having a notch in the front of the housing in the<br>
elliptical cylinder form in a horizontal placement condition of the electronic device. The<br>
notch portion is comprised of a front face of a panel member 12 arranged in a front edge<br>
portion of the aluminum cover 56 comprising a top of the main housing 10, and front board<br>
portions 20 and 22 which spreads from a lower edge portion of the front face of the panel<br>
member 12 to the front, and is provided horizontally to the setting surface of the electronic<br>
device. The panel member 12 has insertion port formation surface portions 18, 24 in an<br>
inclined front face thereof. The front board portions 20 and 22 will be described in detail<br>
later.<br>
An insertion port formation surface portion 18 is provided in a right side of the<br>
electronic device. An insertion port, which is for inserting a main storage medium that<br>
stores an operation program of the electronic device, is formed in the insertion port<br><br>
formation surface portion 18. Specifically, the operation program is stored in an optical<br>
disk, and an optical disk insertion port 14 for inserting the optical disk is formed in the<br>
insertion port formation surface portion 18. In the back of the optical disk insertion port<br>
14, an automatic loading mechanism is provided. Thus, when the user inserts part of the<br>
optical disk into the optical disk insertion port 14, the optical disk is automatically moved<br>
through a disk path 82 (refer to Fig. 4) parallel to the setting surface in the horizontal<br>
placement condition of the electronic device, and then the optical disk as a whole is loaded<br>
into the electronic device (refer to Fig. 4).<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, a disk path 82a not parallel to the setting surface may be<br>
provided. At that time, the disk path 82a is provided approximately perpendicular to the<br>
insertion port formation surface portion 18, as a result of which a user's eye direction is<br>
approximately parallel to the disk path 82a when the electronic device is horizontally<br>
placed, and consequently an electronic device having better functionality is realized. On<br>
the other hand, the insertion port formation surface portion 24 is provided in a left side of<br>
the electronic device, and an insertion port, which is for inserting a medium that stores data<br>
used in the operation program of the electronic device is formed. Specifically, in the<br>
insertion port formation surface portion 24, a memory stick (trademark) insertion port 26,<br>
an SD (trademark) card insertion port 28, and a compact flash (trademark) card insertion<br>
port 30 are formed in this order from the left in a direction approximately parallel to a<br>
longitudinal direction of the main housing 10.<br>
A lower end of the insertion port formation surface portion 18 is connected to a top<br>
of the frame member 60. The flat front board portion 20 formed inside the frame member<br>
60 spreads from a lower edge of the insertion port formation surface portion 18 to the front,<br>
and parallel to the setting surface in the horizontal placement condition of the electronic<br>
device. Similarly, the lower end of the insertion port formation surface portion 24 is<br>
connected to the top of the frame member 60. The flat front board portion 22 formed<br><br>
inside the frame member 60 spreads from the lower edge of the insertion port formation<br>
surface portion 24 to the front, and parallel to the setting surface in the horizontal<br>
placement condition of the electronic device. In the electronic device, upper surface of <br>
the front board portions 20, 22 spread in a lower side of the insertion port of each<br>
information storage medium in the horizontal placement condition of the electronic device.<br>
Therefore, when a user inserts the medium into the insertion port, or removes it from the <br>
insertion port, even if a medium slips from the hand, the medium is put on the front board<br>
portions 20 and 22 and thus prevented from falling off to the floor. Moreover, the front<br>
board portion 22 is formed wide compared with the area of the memory stick or the SD<br>
card. Therefore, when the medium is exchanged, the user can temporarily place it on the <br>
front board portion 22, resulting in improvement in convenience. Furthermore, since the <br>
insertion direction of each medium is approximately parallel to the front board portions 20<br>
and 22, the user can use the front board portions 20 and 22 as guides when each medium is<br>
inserted.<br>
The front board portion 22 and the insertion port formation surface portion 24 are<br>
covered witii an opening-and-closing cover 76. The opening-and-closing cover 76<br>
includes a curved platelike aluminum cover 32 formed by extrusion of aluminum. The<br>
aluminum cover 32 is attached to a cover support member 36 formed, for example, from<br>
plastic. The cover support member 36 includes a flat plate portion to be adhered to a back<br>
face of the aluminum cover 32. Hinge arms 36L, 36R are attached to both ends of one side<br>
of the cover support member 36. The hinge arms 36L, 36R are inserted into the inside of <br>
the electronic device from openings formed in left and right sides of insertion port<br>
formation surface portion 24. Ends of the hinge arms 36L, 36R are rotatably pivoted by<br>
an opening-and-closing shaft 78 (refer to Fig. 3). Moreover, stoppers 40, 38 are vertically<br>
arranged in left and right sides of the front board portion 22, and when the <br>
opening-and-closing cover 76 is closed, they are contacted to both ends of the aluminum<br><br>
cover 32. The stopper 40 spreads to the front in the lower side of the insertion port<br>
formation surface portion 24 in the vertical placement condition of the electronic device.<br>
Thus, the user can temporarily place various media on the stopper 40, leading to<br>
improvement in convenience.<br>
The upper-left side plate 110 is vertically arranged in a further lateral side of the<br>
stopper 40. Moreover, a partition board 62 is vertically arranged in a further lateral side of<br>
the stopper 38. The partition board 62 is formed by extrusion of aluminum. The<br>
partition board 62 separates between the insertion port formation surface portions 18 and<br>
24, and separates between the front board portions 20 and 22. When the<br>
opening-and-closing cover 76 is disposed in a closing position, a left side of the<br>
opening-and-closing cover 76 is closed by the left side plate 110, and a right side is closed<br>
by the partition board 62. On a top surface of the aluminum cover 32, an anti-slip<br>
protrusion 34 is formed in an edge portion in a front side. The user can easily open or<br>
close the opening-and-closing cover 76 by putting a hand on the anti-slip protrusion 34.<br>
According to the electronic device, the opening-and-closing cover 76 is attached<br>
in such a manner that it can move between a closing position (position shown by a broken<br>
line in Fig. 3) where the front board portion 22 and the insertion port formation surface<br>
portion 24 are covered and an opening position (position shown by a two-dot chain line in<br>
Fig. 3) where they are exposed. Therefore, when the user does not insert or remove the<br>
memory stick, SD card, or compact flash, the opening-and-closing cover 76 is set to the<br>
closing position, thus preventing accumulation of dust in the front board portion 22 or the<br>
stopper 40, or entering of dust into the memory stick insertion port 26, SD card insertion<br>
port 28, and compact flash card insertion port 30. Moreover, in the event that the<br>
electronic device is mainly used for reproduction and execution of various digital contents<br>
recorded in the optical disk, only the optical disk insertion port 14 necessary for using the<br>
optical disk is exposed, and insertion ports for other media are normally closed by the<br><br>
opening-and-closing cover 76. Thus, even a beginner can easily understand how to use<br>
the unit.<br>
Next, the left and right side faces of the main housing 10 are described. The<br>
upper-left side plate 110 arranged on the left side face of the main housing 10 has an<br>
extended interface cover 58 attached. The user removes the extended interface cover 58,<br>
so that they can connect an information storage medium such as a hard disk or a ROM<br>
cartridge, or a peripheral instrument such as a communication module or a sensor, to the<br>
electronic device (refer to Fig. 3). A mounting position of the peripheral instrument,<br>
which is covered with the extended interface cover 58, is provided near a central position<br>
of the left side face of the main housing 10. Thus, me electronic device is mounted with 3<br>
the peripheral instrument. Also when the electronic device is placed vertically, the center of<br>
the gravity of the electronic device is concentrated to a further lower side, and<br>
consequendy the electronic device is set stably.<br>
Moreover, a protrusion (for example, made of rubber) for vertical placement is<br>
provided on the left side face of the main housing 10, so mat when the electronic device is<br>
placed vertically, the electronic device is set stably, and a cooling effect of the electronic<br>
device is increased by setting the electronic device so as not to contact the setting surface.<br>
In particular, a protrusion 46 is provided on an upper edge portion of the upper-left side<br>
plate 110. Moreover, two protrusions 42, 44 are also provided on a portion of the frame<br>
member 60 that is beyond the left side end face of the main housing 10. Furthermore, two<br>
protrusions 48, 50 are also provided on a left side end face of the base portion 52 attached<br>
on the lower portion of the main housing 10. The electronic device is supported by the<br>
protrusions 42, 44, 46, 48 and 50 in the vertical placement. In particular, since the frame<br>
member 60 is attached with the protrusions 42, 44, the electronic device is stably placed in<br>
a vertical direction.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 7, protrusions 70, 72, 80 and 84 are attached to a<br><br>
bottom of the base portion 52. In horizontal placement of the electronic device, the<br>
electronic device is supported by the protrusions 70, 72, 80 and 84.<br>
On the right side face of the main housing 10 of the main electronic device, the<br>
upper-right side plate 116 and the lower-right side plate 118 are provided as described<br>
before. Among them, many vent holes 66 are opened in the lower right side plate 118<br>
(refer to Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). Not-shown fans are provided within the vent holes 66 for<br>
cooling the electronic device. The vent holes 66 are situated in the lower side in the<br>
horizontal placement condition, and at a place near the setting surface such as a floor, the<br>
number of the vent holes 66 is small, in addition, the size (opening area) of the holes is<br>
reduced. Specifically, the vent holes 66 are formed on a plurality of arrays provided<br>
approximately parallel to the setting surface. The vent holes 66 are formed in such a<br>
manner that the number or size of the vent holes 66 disposed on the arrays is varied<br>
depending on a distance from the setting surface. According to such a composition, when<br>
air is exhausted through the vent holes 66, dust accumulated on the setting surface is hardly<br>
disturbed by the air. When air is introduced through the vent holes 66 conversely, it is still<br>
hard for the dust accumulated on the setting surface to be drawn in.<br>
In the electronic device, an overhanging portion 68 is provided in the right side of<br>
the main housing 10, in which the vent holes 66 are formed, in addition to the overhanging<br>
portions 69, 71 in the front side and a rear side of the main housing 10 (refer to Fig. 2). In<br>
particularly, the right side face in which the vent holes 66 are formed and a right side face<br>
of the base portion 52 are not formed in the same plane, and the right side face of the base<br>
portion 52 is formed inside with respect to the right side face of the main housing 10. A<br>
lower side of the right side portion of the main housing 10 is not attached with the base<br>
portion 52, and the right side portion is in a floating condition in the air. Thus, a space is<br>
secured in a downward direction of the vent holes 66 in addition to upward, left and right<br>
directions of them, and consequently the electronic device is efficiently cooled.<br><br>
Finally, a back face of the electronic device is described. In the back face,<br>
various connection terminals and switches are disposed in two lines. Terminals disposed<br>
in a lower line in the various connection terminals and the like are two HDMI (High<br>
Definition Multimedia Interface) terminals 96, an AV terminal 100, a light digital terminal<br>
102, a main power switch 104, and a power cable terminal 106. These are provided in this<br>
order from the left on a back face 109 of the base portion 52. Terminals disposed in an<br>
upper line in the various connection terminals and the like are two USB terminals 86 and<br>
three Ethernet ports 90. These are provided in this order from the left over the back face<br>
109 of the base portion 52 and the planar back face 111 of me main housing 10. As shown<br>
in Fig. 3, the planar back face 111 is situated in a fore side of a rearmost end face of the<br>
main housing 10. Moreover, as described before, the backside overhanging portion 71 is<br>
provided at the backside of me main housing 10. Thus, the connection portions of various<br>
connection terminals of peripheral equipment connected to the back side of the electronic<br>
device are protected by the main housing 10.<br>
According to the electronic device as described hereinbefore, the main housing 10<br>
is formed in the approximately elliptical cylinder form, and disposed in such a manner that<br>
the longitudinal direction of me housing (axial direction of the elliptic cylinder) is<br>
approximately horizontal to the setting surface. Therefore, even if the instrument is<br>
accommodated in an accommodation rack such as an audio board, since a space is secured<br>
in the upper portion of the main housing 10, cooling efficiency of me electronic device is<br>
increased. Moreover, the front board portions 20, 22 are formed in me front of the optical<br>
disk insertion port 14, memory-stick insertion port 26, SD card insertion port 28, and<br>
compact-flash insertion port 30. Thus, while handling various media, the media are<br>
prevented from directly falling to the floor, leading to improvement in convenience of the<br>
electronic device.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and it will be apparent to<br><br>
those skilled in the art that various modifications can be made, and the modifications are<br>
also included in the scope of the invention.<br><br>
