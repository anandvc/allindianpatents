				<td>The present invention is concerned with compounds which inhibit the reverse ', transcriptase encoded by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are of value in the prevention of infection by HIV, the treatment of infection by HIV and the treatment of the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and to a method of use of the present compounds and other agents for the treatment of AIDS arid viral infection by HIV.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A retrovirus designated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of the complex disease that includes progressive destruction of the immune system (acquired immune deficiency syndrome; AIDS) and degeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system.<br>
Currently available drugs for AIDS therapy are divided into two groups: those that prevent infection of target cells [nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)], and those that prevent HIV-1-infected cells from yielding infectious viruses (protease inhibitors). Monotherapy with antiretroviral agents has shown limited effects, very likely due to the interplay of phenomena such as: high viral loads and multiplication rates of HIV, incomplete inhibition of viral replication and emergence of drug resistant mutants. For this reason, combination therapies with two or more drugs have been proposed for a more effective treatment of AIDS. Potent suppression of HIV replication over prolonged periods has been accomplished with regimens including reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors, although on stopping therapies viraemia has rapidly reappeared. In the attempt to obtain better results, research is now focused on exploiting new targets and enhancing the activity of "old" drugs. Among the latter, NNRTs possibly endowed with better pharmacokinetic profiles, capability to inhibit clinically relevant mutants and, hopefully, to minimize HIV multiplication are being pursued.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are dihydro-alkyloxy-benzyl-oxopyrimidines (DABOs) which potently inhibit HIV multiplication targeting reverse transcriptase without bioactivation.<br>

Preparation Of Methvl Arvlacetvlalkvlacetates<br>
SCHEME A<br>
(Scheme Removed)Anhydrous .pyridine (400 mmoles, 32.5 mi) was added with stirring under nitrogen atmosphere into an ice-cooled solution of 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrurm's acid) (165 mmoles, 23.75 g) in anhydrous dichloromethane (50 ml). The resulting solution was treated, over a 2 h period at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere, with a solution of crude arylacetyl chloride in anhydrous dichloromethane (50 ml). Arylacetyl chloride was prepared before use by refluxing the proper arylacetic acid (43.2 mmoles) with thionyl chloride (21.3 ml) under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. Then, the mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, poured into crushed ice and treated with 2N HC1 (100 ml). The organic layer was separated and the aqueous solution was extracted twice with dichloromethane (25 ml). The organic phase and the extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried and evaporated. The solid residue was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (250 ml1* and the solution was refiuxed for 20 h. After cooling, metal sodium (0.16 g-atoms, 3.68 g) was carefully added and the mixture was stirred until dissolution was complete. Alkyl halide (160 mmoles) was dropped into the solution and the resulting mixture was heated at reflux for 4-12 h. After cooling, the solvent was removed and the residue treated with water (200 ml) and extracted with chloroform (3 x 100 ml). The organic layer was washed with brine (2 x 100 ml), dried and evaporated to give the desired compound, which was purified by passing through a silica gel column (chloroform as eluent).<br>
In the above reaction, arylacetic acid (Scheme "A") or arylacetyl chloride can be replaced with the corresponding l-arylace^tylimidazolide (Scheme "B") or with arylacetylethoxycarbonylanhydride. whereas the Meldrum's acid can be replaced with ethyl acetylacetate, ethyl alkylmalonate or ethyl alkylmalonate potassium salt, to give the proper ethyl arylacetylalkylacetates in high yields.<br>
Preparation Of Compounds (I) With X = Q (Scheme AV<br>
The proper methyl arylacetylalkylacetate (10 mmoles) in methanol (50 ml) was added to a well-stirred suspension of 0-methylisourea hydrogen sulphate (15 mmoles, 2.58 g) and calcium hydroxide (16 mmoles, 1.18 g) in water (50 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 72 h, then concentrated, made acid (pH 5) with 0.5N acetic acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 ml). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine (100 ml), dried and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by crystallization<br>
from the proper solvent yielding pure 5-alkyl-6-benzyl-3,4-dihydro-2-methoxypyrimidin-4-one. This compound was then refluxed with the proper potassium alkoxide (100 mmoles of potassium metal in 20-30 ml of alcohol freshly distilled on sodium metal) under nitrogen atmosphere until starting material disappeared at the TLC control. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated, made acid (pH 5) with 0.5N acetic acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 ml). The combined extracts were washed once with brine (100 ml), dried and evaporated to give the required 2-alkoxy-5-alkyl-6-benzyl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-4-one derivative, which was recrystallized from a suitable solvent or purified by column chromatography (silica gel; ethyl acetate:chloroform 1:1). Physical and chemical data of representative compounds of the invention are reported in table 1; cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-1 activity data are reported in table 2.<br>
SCHEME B<br>
Preparation Of Compound (T) With X = S<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The proper ethyl arylacetylalkyiacetate (31.5 mmoles) was successively added to a stirred solution of sodium metal (0.063 g-atoms) in 50 mL of absolute ethanol (50 ml) thiourea (43 mmoles). The mixture was heated while stirring at reflux for 5 h. After cooling, the solvent was distilled in vacua at 40-50°C until dryness and the residue was dissolved in water (200 mL) and made acid (pH 5) with 0.5N acetic acid. The resulting precipitate (the crude 2-thiouraciI derivative) was filtered under reduced pressure, washed with diethyl ether, vacuum dried at 80°C for 12 h and then crystallized from the proper solvent.<br>
Then, according to method A, iodomethane (8 mmoles, 1.13 g) was added to a suspension containing the proper 2-thiouracil derivative (4 mmoles) in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (2 ml), and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature until the starting material disappeared at the TLC control (silica gel; n-hexane: ethyl acetate: methanol 12:3:1). Then the reaction content was poured on cold water (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 ml). The organic layers were collected, washed with a sodium thiosulfate solution (100 ml), brine (3 x 50 ml), dried and evaporated to furnish the crude 5-alkyl-6-benzyl-3,4-dihydro-2-methylthiopyrimidin-4-one (2) as a solid purified by crystallization.<br>
Alternatively, according to methods B and C, potassium carbonate (4.2 mmoles) and the proper alkyl halide (4.4 mmoles) were added to a suspension containing 2-thiouracil derivative (4 mmoles) in anhydrous N,N-dimethy lformami.de (2 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature (method B) or at 80° C (method C) until starting material disappeared at the TLC control (silica gel; n-hexane:ethyl acetate:methanol 12:3:1). Then the reaction content was poured on cold water (200 mL), made acid (pH 5) with 0.5N acetic acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 50 ml). The organic layers were collected, washed with a sodium thiosulfate solution (100 ml), brine (100 ml), dried and evaporated to furnish 5-alkyl-6-benzyl-3,4-dihydro-2-methylthiopyrimidin-4-ones (3) and (4) as crude material which was then purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent: n-hexane:ethyl acetate:methanoM2:3:l) followed by crystallization. Physical and chemical data of representative compounds of the invention are reported in table 1. Cytotoxicity and anti-Hi V-l activity in vitro are reported in table 2.<br>
Preparation Of Compounds (I) With X = NK<br>
SCHEME C<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Title derivatives were prepared according to the procedure described for the synthesis of compounds with X = S (I), using ethyl arylacetylalkylacetates and guanidine [2-amino-6-benzylpyrimidin-4-ones (5)] as starting materials. 2-Alkylaminoderivatives (6) were synthesized by heating the previously reported 5-alkyl-6-benzyl-3.4-dihydro-2-methylthio pyrimidin-4-ones with 20-30 ml of proper amine in a sealed tube at 170°C for 24 h. Physical and chemical data of some compounds (6) are reported in table 1. Cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-l activity in vitro are reported in table 2. The compounds of the present invention are useful in the inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase, the prevention or treatment of infection by the .   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the treatment of consequent pathological conditions such as AIDS. Treating AIDS or preventing or treating infection by HIV is defined as including, but not limited to, treating a wide range of states of HIV infection: AIDS, ARC (AIDS related complex), both symptomatic and asymptomatic, and actual or potential exposure to HIV. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating infection by HIV after suspected past exposure to HIV by, e.g., blood transfusion, organ transplant, exchange of body fluids, bites, accidental needle stick, or exposure to patient blood during surgery.<br>
The compounds of this invention are also useful in the preparation and execution,of screening for antiviral compounds. For example, the compounds of this invention are useful for isolating enzyme mutants, which are excellent screening tools for more powerfulantiviral compounds. Furthermore, the compounds of this invention are useful in establishing or determining the binding site of other antiviral to HIV reverse transcriptase e.g., by competitive inhibition. Thus the compounds of this invention are commercial products to be sold for these purposes. For inhibitibn of HIV reverse transcriptase, the prevention or treatment of infection by HIV and the treatment of AIDS or ARC, the compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally (including subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques), by inhalation spray, or rectally, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.

ANTIVIRAL ASSAY PROCEDURES<br>
Compounds. Compounds were solubilized in DMSO at 200 mM and then diluted into culture medium.<br>
Cells and viruses. MT-4, C8166, H9/IIIB and CEM cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPM! 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PCS), 100 lU/mL penicillin and 100 ug/mL streptomycin. Cell cultures were checked periodically for the absence of mycoplasma contamination with a MycoTect Kit (Gibco). Human<br>
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1, IIIB strain) was obtained from supernatants of ' persistently infected H9/IIIB cells. HIV-1 stock solution had a litres of 4.5x10" 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50)/ml.<br>
HIV titration. Titration of HIV was performed in C8166 cells by the standard limiting dilution method (dilution 1:2, four replica wells per dilution) in 96-well plates. The infectious virus litre was determined by light microscope scoring of cytopathicity after 4 days of incubation and the virus titres were expressed as CCID50/mL.<br>
Anti-HIV assays. Activity of the compounds against HIV-1 and HIV-2 multiplication in acutely .infected cells was based on the inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity in MT-4 and C8166 cells, respectively. Briefly, 50 uL of culture medium containing lxlOJ cells were added to each well of flat-bottom microtiter trays containing 50 ul of culture medium with or without various concentrations of the test compounds. Then 20 µL of an HIV suspension . containing 100 CCID50, were added. After a 4-day incubation at 37 °C, the number of viable cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-l-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was evaluated in parallel with their antiviral activity. It was based on the viability of mock-infected cells, as monitored by the MTT method.<br>
RTassays. Assays were performed as follows. Briefly, purified rRT was assayed for its RNA-dependent polymerase-associated activity in a 50 uL volume containing: 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.8), 80 mM KCI1, 6mM MgC12,1 mM DTT. 0.1 mg/ mL BSA, 0.3 OD2N, unit/mL template:primer [poly(rC)-oligo(dG)12-18] and 10 µM [3H]dGTP (1 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the samples were spotted on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/A), and the acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined.<br>
