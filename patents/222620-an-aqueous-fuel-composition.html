A microemulsion fuel containing a hydrocarbon fraction, ethanol, water and an additive comprising a nitrogen-containing surfactant and an alcohol.<br>
The present invention relates to an aqueous fuel composition having a homogeneous liquid phase, a so called microemulsion, containing a liquid hydrocarbon fraction, ethanol and an additive with an emulsifying and solubilizing ability.<br>
In order to diminish the dependency on mineral oil, which is a not-renewable source of energy, mixed compositions, e g for use as fuels for internal combustion engines have been developed. In many of these fuel compositions a part of the hydrocarbon fraction has been replaced with water-containing ethanol or anhydrous ethanol. Diesel oil and anhydrous ethanol form solutions when blended but the presence of even a very low amount of water will cause a separation into a hydrocarbon phase and an ethanol/water phase. At lower temperatures the tendency of phase separation increases essentially. It is therefore important to maintain the fuel in a homogeneous liquid phase over the entire temperature range at which the fuel can be exposed.<br>
During the years a large number of methods have been suggested to increase the stability of a mixed fuel containing aqueous ethanol and hydrocarbons. Thus, EP-Al-89 147 discloses a macroemulsion comprising liquid hydrocarbons, ethanol and water and as an emulsifier a polyetherpolystyrene block copolymer. However, the stability of such emulsions is limited and even minor separations may cause disturbances when starting or running an internal combustion engine, or causing increased emissions, for example of CO and organic substances, when burnt.<br>
EP-A1-475 620 discloses a microemulsion diesel fuel containing a hydrocarbon fraction, water and optionally also ethanol. In order to form a microemulsion between the water phase and the hydrocarbon fraction, a blend of a hydrophilic surfactant and a lipophilic surfactant is added, in<br><br>
particular a mixture of a sulfonate and an ethoxylate. This fuel needs large amounts of surfactants and is furthermore rather sensitive to temperature variations.<br>
The Derwent abstract, accession number 1983-19166K, week 8308, 58008793, describes the use of C3 or higher monohydric alcohols, such as octanol and decanol, in mixed fuels containing ethanol and a hydrocarbon fuel oil* Although these alcohols have a high capacity of forming microemulsions over a large temperature range, the fuels obtained have poor lubrication and a corrosive effect.<br>
In US 4 504 276 a surfactant composition suitable for the emulsification of methanol or ethanol in a hydrocarbon liquid is described, the surfactant composition being a blend of i) a block or graft copolymer and ii) a salt of an aliphatic amino compound and a long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acid. In the blends 15 to 18 the salts contain amino compounds having an aliphatic group within the range from 8-18 carbon atoms. However, in all working examples where any of the blends 15-18 was used as an emulsif ier, macroemulsions were formed, which will separate upon storage.<br>
The Brazilian patent Application PI9804481-8 describes an additive composition for mixed ethanol and hydrocarbon fuels to improve the tolerance of the fuels to humidity and dispersed water and to improve the stability. The additive composition comprises from 90-100% of at least two compounds selected from the classes consisting of<br>
a)	fatty acids with 12 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
b)	specific polyamines,<br>
c)	specific fatty esters of polyoxyalkylene glycols,<br>
d)	certain compounds containing hydrophilic and lipophilic sites, and<br>
e)	certain cetane index activating substances.<br>
The mixed fuels in the working examples seem to be macro-emulsions .<br>
It has now been found that the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art fuel compositions can be essentially avoided<br><br>
by a fuel composition having a homogeneous liquid phase, a microemulsion, containing<br>
a)	70-95%, preferably 75-92%, by weight of a hydrocarbon fraction having a boiling point within the range from 130 to 425°C/<br>
b)	2-25%, preferably 5-15%, by weight of ethanol,<br>
c)	0.002-1.2%, preferably 0.002%-0.8%, and most preferably 0.005-0.4%, by weight of water, and<br>
d)	0,2-25%, preferably 0.5-15%, by weight of an additive comprising<br>
i)   5-100%, preferably 5-90% and most preferably 10-50%, by weight of a nitrogen-containing surfactant of the formula<br><br>
where A is an alkyleneoxy group of 2-3 carbon atoms, n is 0-4, p is a number from 2-3, m is from 0-3,<br>
R is an aliphatic group or an acyl group of 8-22, preferably 12-2 0, carbon atoms or the group R20(A)nR3, where R2 is an aliphatic group of 8-22 carbon atoms, R3 is the group CpH2 p, where p has the meaning mentioned above, or the group CH2CH(0H)CH2 and A and n have the meanings mentioned above, Y is an alkyl group of 1-4 carbon atoms or the group (A)nH, where A and n have the meanings mentioned above, B is the group -&gt;0 and v is 0 or 1 provided that when v is l then Y cannot be hydrogen, X is the group<br>
(A)nH<br>
I CpH2pN<br>
where A, p and n have the meanings mentioned above and r is<br>
0-2, with the proviso that when mis 0, r must be 0; the sum<br>
of all n in formula I being 0-5, and<br><br>
ii)  0-95%, preferably 10-95% and most preferably from 50-90%, by weight of an alcohol of the formula<br>
ROH	(II),<br>
where R is a hydrocarbon group having 5-24, preferably an aliphatic group of 8-14/ carbon atoms.<br>
The fuel composition of the present invention is stable in a large temperature interval and the mixture of the liquid hydrocarbon fraction, ethanol and water are present in a homogeneous phase, a microemulsion, even at low temperatures. Therefore, the composition can be stored for long periods within the temperature interval without any risk for phase separation. Since the mixture of the liquid hydrocarbon fraction, ethanol and water has the form of a microemulsion and not the form of a macroemulsion, there is no need for an addition of a stabilizing polymer such as the block or graft polymer disclosed in US 4 504 276. The composition may advantageously be used as a fuel, especially as a fuel for internal combustion engines, which quite often can be subjected to large variations in temperature.<br>
For example, microemulsions between the hydrocarbon ethanol and water can be established at temperatures far below -20°C, although in many cases the existence of a microemulsion down to 5°C or 0°C may be satisfactory. In addition, the composition of the present invention has excellent anticorrosive and lubricating properties and these properties have been confirmed in diesel engine tests. It is believed that the properties depend on the presence of the nitrogen-containing surfactants, which via the nitrogen atoms are weakly attached to the metallic surfaces, for example in a diesel engine. The hydrophobic part of the surfactant can then impart lubrication and corrosion-inhibiting properties.<br>
The additive has a good capability to form clear solutions (microemulsions) between the hydrocarbon fraction ethanol and water. At high temperatures, for instance between 5°C and 25°C, the amount of the additive needed to achieve a microemulsion is low in relation to the amount of ethanol and<br><br>
-25°C, the amount of the additive has to be increased or as an alternative the amount of ethanol and/or water has to be reduced.<br><br>
where R is an aliphatic group having 8-22 carbon atoms, A is an alkyleneoxy group having 2-3 carbon atoms, p is 2 or 3, preferably 3, m is 0-3, and n is 0-4, the sum of all n being<br>
where R is an aliphatic group having 8-22 carbon atoms and R2 and R2 are an alkyl group having 1-4 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, or a hydroxyalkyl group having 2-4 carbon atoms, for example hydroxyethyl; or a mixture of any one of the surfactants defined in la, lb or Ic.<br><br><br>
where R is an aliphatic group of 8-22 carbon atoms and R3, A, n, p and m have the same meanings as in formula I. Especially preferred compounds are those where R is an aliphatic group of 12-20 carbon atoms, p is 3, m is 0-2 and n is 0-2; the sum of all n being 0-2.<br><br>
where R is an acyl group of 8-22, preferably 12-20, carbon atoms, m is 0-2, n is a number from 0-2, the sum of all n being 0-2, and A and p have the same meanings as in formula I. Preferably p is 3 and m is l.<br>
According to the invention it may often be favourable to combine compounds from the different groups. Thus, combinations of alcohols of formula II and nitrogen-containing surfactants of formula I, such as surfactants of formulae la, lb, Ic, Id and Ie, have in tests shown a high solubilizing effect. Preferably the amount of the alcohol of formula II is from 10-95%, more preferably 50 to 90%, by weight and the nitrogen-containing surfactant of formula I from 5-90%, preferably 10-50%, by weight of the combination. Examples of such combinations are an alcohol of formula II, where R preferably is an aliphatic group of 8-13 carbon atoms, combined with a compound of formula la, where m is 0 or 1, R is an aliphatic group of 16-20 carbon atoms and Z n is 1-5, a compound of formula lb, where r is 1, or a compound with formula Id, where n is 0 and R3 is C3H6<br>
The alcohol of formula II can be alkyl substituted phenols, such as oktylphenol, dioktylphenol, nonylphenol and dinonylphenol. Due to environmental reasons alcohols containing aliphatic groups are preferred. The aliphatic groups have normally 5-22, preferably 8-14, carbon atoms.<br><br>
Examples of suitable alcohols of formula II, where R is an aliphatic group, are n-octanol, isooctanol, primary alcohols being branched in second position, such as 2-ethylhexanol, 2 -propylheptanol and 2 -butyloctanol, decanol, dodecanol, methyl-branched C9-C13 alcohols, palm fatty alcohols, rape seed fatty alcohols, coco nut fatty alcohols and tallow fatty alcohols. In the compounds of formulae la, lb, Ic and Id, the group R can be an aliphatic group derived from the above mentioned fatty alcohols, oleyl, 2-ethylhexyl, isooctyl, n-octyl, n-decyl, 2-propylheptyl, 2 -butyloctyl and methyl-substituted alkyl groups with 9-13 carbon atoms. The acyl groups in formula Ie are suitably acyl group derived from fatty acids or synthetic acids, such as decanoic, dodecanoic, palm fatty acid, coco nut fatty acids, rape seed fatty acids and tallow fatty acids.<br>
In the formula I the symbols m and r are preferably 0 or 1 and 1, respectively. The symbol n is preferably 0, when ra is 0 and R is an aliphatic group of 8-14 carbon atoms. When m is 1-3, r is 1-2 and R is an aliphatic group with 15-22, preferably 16-20, carbon atoms, then the sum of all n is preferably 1-5. The alkyleneoxy group A is preferably ethyleneoxy, although one or more of the A groups may be a propyleneoxy group in order to adjust the HLB-value of the compound or the mixture.<br>
Besides the essential components the composition may also contain other conventional additives, such as corrosion inhibitors, viscosity improving agents, lubrication improving additives, cetan number increasing additives, surface-tension reducers and ignition improving agents as well as other solubilizers. The presence of peroxide compounds may also affect the stability of the present composition.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following working examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Fuel compositions according to the present invention as well as a number of comparison fuel compositions were produced bv mixing a hydrocarbon fraction suitable to be used<br><br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
The fuel composition was prepared by mixing an aqueous alcohol containing 0.04% by weight of water a hydrocarbon fraction having a boiling point range from 180°C to 295°C and an additive. The amounts of the hydrocarbon fraction, pure ethanol, water content and additive is disclosed in Table II. The cloud points of the fuel compositions were determined. Results obtained are also shown in Table II.<br><br><br>
From the results it is evident that the compositions 1-9 according to the invention even at very low temperatures form homogeneous, stable phase between the hydrocarbon fraction, ethanol and water. These compositions are therefore suitable to be used as diesel fuels*<br>
Example 2<br>
In the same manner as in Example 1, a number of compositions were tested in order to evaluate their suitability to be used as a diesel fuel. The hydrocarbon fraction used in these compositions had a boiling point range from 159-360°C and a cloud point of -12°C due to preciptation in the hydrocarbon fraction. The compositions tested and the<br><br>
Prom the results it is evident that the presence of an additive according to the invention results in the formation of a homogeneous phase below 0°C. Since the hydrocarbon fraction forms preciptations at -12°C it is not possible to determine the actual cloud point depending on the presence of water and ethanol below -12°C by this method.<br>
Example 3<br>
Fuel compositions based on the hydrocarbon fraction of Example 1 were prepared according to Table IV below. The<br><br>
cloud points of the different compositions were determined and results obtained are also shown in Table IV.<br>
Table IV.   Composition containing ethanol having 0.07%<br><br>
From the test  it is evident that the fuel compositions have the ability to form microemulsions down to 0°C.  At  lower addition of alcohol the cloud points will be essentially-lowered.<br>
Example 4<br>
Fuel compositions according to the invention were prepared by using ethanol containing 1% by water. The<br><br><br>
From the test it is evident that at a water content of about 0.1% and an ethanol content of just over 10%, the fuel compositions are present as microeraulsions down to 5°C.<br>
Example 5<br>
Fuel compositions according to the invention were prepared with aqueous alcohol containing 2% water. The hydrocarbon fraction was the same as in Example 1. The compositions and their cloud points are shown in Table VI<br><br>
From the results it is evident that an increasing amount of water also noticeably increases the cloud point.<br>
Example  6<br>
Five fuel compositions containing a hydrocarbon fraction of Example 1 or Example 2 and an ethanol having 0.07% by<br><br>
weight of water were prepared and their lubricating properties were evaluated by the High-Frequency Reciprocating Rig   (HFFR)   according to ASTM D 6079-99.   The compositions and the results obtained are shown in Table VII below.<br><br>
The results obtained clearly illustrate that  the fuel compositions 41 and 42 according to the invention have excellent  lubricating properties.<br><br><br><br>
