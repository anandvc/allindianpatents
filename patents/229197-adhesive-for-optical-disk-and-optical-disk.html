Description ADHESIVE FOR OPTICAL DISK AND OPTICAL DISK<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an adhesive for an optical disk, in particular, an adhesive for an optical disk capable of being cured by irradiation of an ultraviolet ray, and an optical disk bonded with the adhesive, in particular, an optical disk formed by bonding two disk substrates, represented by DVD.<br>
Background Art<br>
Under present circumstances, a DVD bonded type optical disk includes, in terms of the constitution of the recording layer, DVD-5 having a recording capacity of about 5 GB with a single recording layer and DVD-9 having a recording capacity of about 9 GB with two recording layers, and DVD-9 having a larger recording capacity is currently being mainstream. The substrate of DVD-9, which is the current mainstream, uses an aluminum compound as a total reflection film, and gold as a translucent reflection film. Since the translucent reflection film must transmit laser, it must be a thin film comparing to the total reflection film, and thus gold, which is a representative example of stable compounds, has been used.<br>
However, since gold is an expensive material, it is being<br><br>
considered that the material of the translucent reflection film is replaced with a silicone compound and a silver compound, which are inexpensive.  In order to further increase the recording capacity, investigations for blue laser are being currently advanced. In the case of red laser, there is no problem in transmittance of red laser when the translucent reflection film is gold, silicone, silver or a silver alloy. In the case of blue laser, however, it has a wavelength around 400 nm, and silver exhibits excellent performance in transmittance at that wavelength comparing to the other materials.  Therefore, a translucent reflection film using silver is being developed. However, silver is liable to be oxidized comparing to gold, and is chemically unstable. Therefore, a bonded disk using a silver translucent reflection film cannot provide such durability (reliability) that is equivalent to the conventional bonded optical disk using gold as a translucent reflection film. The improvement in durability (reliability) is a significant problem for attaining full-fledged practical application of the silver translucent reflection film.<br>
The invention is to solve the problem with improvement of an adhesive, and an object thereof is to provide an excellent adhesive that can provide such an optical disk that has high durability (reliability) equivalent to the convent ional optical disk using a gold translucent reflection film even with an optical disk using a chemically unstable material comparing<br><br>
to gold, such as silver or the like, as a translucent reflection film.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors have made earnest investigations to solve the problem based on an estimation that deterioration, such as corrosion or the like, of a translucent reflection film formed with an unstable material comparing to gold, such as silver, a silver alloy or the like, is caused by a slight electric current or the like due to humidity in an adhesive layer, and as a result, it has been found that in the case where such an adhesive is used that contains a monomer having a solution resistance larger than a certain value as a major component, the humidity resistance is improved, and excellent durability (reliability) can be obtained when a translucent reflection film formed with silver or a silver alloy is bonded, whereby the invention has been completed. Therefore, the invention relates to:<br>
(1)	an adhesive for an optical disk containing (A) a {meth)acrylate monomer having a solution resistance of 1.0 x 10^° Qcm or more,<br>

mass or more but less than 50% by mass, the (meth) aery late monomer<br>
(A) having a solution resistance of 1.0 x 10^° Q-cm or more is 40% by mass or more but less than 90% by ma ss, and, as the balance, the photopolymerization initiator (C) and, depending on necessity, a (meth)acrylate phosphate compound (D) and a bisphenol A type epoxy (meth)acrylate (B-2) are contained, and a content of said (meth)acrylate monomer (A) is larger than a content of the urethane (meth)acrylate (B-l),<br>

one of the above (1) to (4 ), wherein , said (meth) acrylate monomer<br>
(A) is at least one selected from a C8 to C18 alkyl monoacrylate,<br>
tricyclodecanedimethylol       di(meth)acrylate       and<br>

The compositions shown in Table 1 thus obtained were subjected to adhesion in the following steps 1 to 3.<br>
1.	25 g of the adhesive was fed to a circular form<br>
on an inside periphery of an aluminum-sputtered DVD substrate.<br>
2.	A silver translucent reflection film (Ag) was<br>
placed on the sputtered DVD substrate with no air being<br>
introduced in to the adhesive, followed by being bonded by spin<br>
coating at 2,000 rpm for 4 seconds. A gold translucent<br>
reflection film (Au) was also bonded to the sputtered DVD<br>
substrate under the same conditions.<br>
3.	Irradiation was made from the side of the silver<br>
or gold translucent reflection film by a high pressure mercury<br>
lamp (80 W/cm) at 300 mJ/cm^ to cure and adhere.<br><br>
After the adhesion, the DVD substrates to which the silver or gold translucent reflection film had been adhered were allowed to stand under circumstances of 80°C and 85%RH for 500 hours. The state of the reflection film was visually observed. The results of the observation were indicated in terms of the following in Table 1.<br>
O: No change was observed in the reflection film.<br>
A: Slight discoloration or pin holes were observed in the reflection film.<br>
x: Significant discoloration or pin holes were observed in the reflection film.<br>
It is apparent from the evaluation results in Table 1<br>
that the adhesive of the invention exerts less influence<br>
particularly on a silver translucent reflection film, and is<br>
excellent in durability.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The adhesive of the invention provides such high durability (reliability) in a bonded optical disk using a silver or silver alloy translucent reflection film that is equivalent to the conventional bonded optical disk using gold as a translucent reflection film. Therefore, the adhesive of the invention is significantly useful as an adhesive for an optical disk applicable to increased recording capacities.<br><br><br><br>

that a content of a urethane (meth)acrylate (B-1) is 10% by<br>
mass or more but less than 50% by mass, the (meth) acrylate<br>
monomer (A) is 40% by mass or more but less than 90% by<br>
mass, and, as the balance, the photopolymerization<br>
initiator (C) and, depending on necessity,such as<br>
hereinbefore described the (meth)acrylate phosphate<br>
compound (D) and the bisphenol type epoxy (meth)acrylate<br>
(B-2) are contained, and a content of the (meth) acrylate<br>
monomer  (A)  is larger than a content of the urethane (meth)acrylate (B-1) .<br><br>
5. An optical disk having a translucent reflection film comprising silicone, silver or a silver alloy, characterized in that the optical disk is a bonded optical disk comprising a substrate having the translucent reflection film bonded to another substrate with an adhesive of any one of claim 1 to 4.<br>
