				<td>4-ANIIiINO QUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ABNORMAL CELL GROWTH<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel bicyclic derivatives that are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of abnormal cell growth in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
^ It is known that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (i.e.. a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation. Alternatively, the overexpresslon of a normal proto-oncogenlc tyrosine .kinase may also result in proliferative disorders, sometimes' resulting in a malignant phenotype.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion which functions as a kinase to phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in proteins' and hence to influence cell proliferation. Examples of receptor tyrosine kinases include c-erbB-2 (HER2), c-met, tie-2, PDGFr, FGFr, and VEGFR.  It is known that such kinases are frequently aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. It Is well known that ERBB2 (protein tyrosine kinase erb 62 precursor (also known as c-erbB-2 protein precursor or kinase related transforming protein erbB2) is a protooncogene that encodes a membrane-bound receptor typrosine kinase of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) family.  It is overexpressed in several types of cancer such as breast, ovarian, stomach, pancreus and colorectal cancers.  ErbB2 has a possible role in tumor-cell proliferation, tumor Invasion and tumor metastasis and drug resistance.<br>
Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are<br>
useful as selective Inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells.    For example,<br>
erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of<br>
a transplanted human mammary carcinoma which expresses epidermal growth factor receptor<br>
tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does<br>
not express the EGF receptor.  Thus, the compounds of the present invention, which are<br>
selective inhibitors of certain receptor tyrosine kinases, are useful in the treatment of abnormal<br>
cell growth, in particular cancer, in mammals.   In addition to receptor tyrosine kinases, the<br>
compounds of the present invention can also display inhibitory activity against a variety of<br>
other non-receptor tyrosine kinases (eg: Ick, src, abl) or serine/threonine kinases (e.g.: cyclin<br>
dependent kinases).<br><br>
.   Various other compounds, such as styrene "derivatives, have also been shown to possess  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitory properties.     More recently,  five  European  patent publications, namely EP 0 566 226 A1 (published October 20, 1993), EP 0 602 851 A1 (published June 22,1994), EP 0 635 507 A1 (published January 25,1995), EP 0 635 498 A1 (published January 25,1995), and EP10 520 722 A1 (published December 30, 1992), refer to certain bicydic derivatives, in particular quinazojirie derivatives, as possessing anti-cancer properties that result from their tyro'sine kinase inhibitory properties.   Also, World Patent Application "WO 92/20642 (published November 26, 1992), refers to certain bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful in inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation. World Patent Applications WO96/16960 (published June 6,1996), WO 96/09294 (published March 6, 1996), WO 97/30034 (published August 21, 19&amp;7), WO 98/02434 (published January 22,1998), WO 98/02437 (published January 22,1998), and WO 98/02438 (published January 22, 1998), also refer to substituted bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives as tyrosine 'kinase inhibitors that are useful for the same purpose.  Other patent applications that refer to anti-cancer compounds are World Patent Application WOOO/44728 (published August 3, 2000), EP 1029853A1 (published, August 23, 2000), and WO01/98277 (published December 12, 2001) all of which are incorporated herein,by reference in their entirety.'<br>

Lett., 25, 32,1984, 3383. Compounds of formula E in which R1 is a d-C6 alkyl group may be<br>
prepared by reductive amination of the parent aniline with R1CH(O). The compound of formula<br>
D may be prepared by treating a compound of formula C, wherein Z1 is an activating group, such<br>
as bromo, iodo, -N2, or -OTf (which is -OS02CF3), or the precursor of an activating group such<br>

halide, vinyl stannane, vinylborane, • alkyl borane, or an alky] or alkenyl zinc' reagent.   The<br>
compound of formula C can be prepared by treating a compound of formula B with a chlorinating<br>
reagent such as POCI3, SOCI2 or CIC(O)C(O)CI/DMF in a halogenated solvent at a temperature<br>
ranging from about 60°C to 150°C for a period ranging from about 2 to 24 hours which in turn<br>

Any compound of formula 1[ can be converted into another compound of formula 1 by standard manipulations to the R5 group. These methods are known to those skilled in the art and include a) removal of a protecting group by methods outlined in T. W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Second Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991; and b) displacement of a leaving group (halide, mesylate, tosylate, etc) with a primary or secondary amine, thiol or alcohol to form a secondary or tertiary amine, thioether or ether, respectively.<br>
The compounds of formulas 1 that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of formula 1 from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br>
Those compounds of formula 1 that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of formula 1. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding<br>
acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product. Since a single compound of the present invention may include*'more than one acidic or basic moieties, the compounds of the present invention may include mono, di or tri-salts in a single compound.<br>
The. compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of the erbB family of oncogenic and protooncogenic protein tyrosine kinases,' in particular erbB2, and Ihus are all adapted to therapeutic use as antiproliferative agents (e.g.. anticancer) in mammals, particularly<br>

signalling of the erbB tyrosine kinases are Involved. In addition, the compounds of the present<br>
invention may have therapeutic utility in inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders<br>
involving both identified and as yet unidentified tyrosine kinases that are inhibited by the<br>

The c-erbB2 kinase assay is similar to that described previously in Schrang et. al. Anal. Biochem. 211,1993, p233-239. Nunc MaxiSorp 96-weII plates are coated by incubation overnight at 37°C with 100 ml per well of 0.25 mg/mL Poly (Glu, Tyr) 4:1 (PGT) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Excess PGT is removed by<br>
aspiration, and the plate is washed three times with wash buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). The kinase reaction is performed in 50 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 125 mM<br>
i<br>
sodium chloride, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanada'te, 1 mM ATP,<br>
0.48 mg/mL (24 ng/well) c-erbB2 intracellular domain. The intracellular domain of the erbB2<br>
tyrosine kinase (amino acids 674-1255) is expressed as a GST fusion protein in Baculovirus<br>
and purified by binding to and elution from glutathione coated beads.   The compound in<br>
' DMSO (di'methylsulfoxide) is added to give a final DMSO concentration of about 2.5%.<br>
Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and proceeded for<br>
6 minutes at room temperature, with constant shaking. The kinase reaction is terminated by<br>
aspiration of the reaction mixture arid subsequent washing with wash buffer (see above).<br>
Phosphorylated PGT is measured by 25 minutes of incubation with 50 ml per well HRP-<br>
conjugated PY54 (Oncogene Science Inc. Uniondale, NY) antiphosphotyrosine .antibody,<br>
diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in blocking buffer (3% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Antibody is<br>
removed by aspiration, and the plate is washed 4 times with wash buffer.  The colorimetric<br>
signal is developed by addition of TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry,<br>
Gaithersburg, MD), 50 ml per well, and stopped by the addition of 0.09 M sulfuric acid, 50 ml<br>
per well.   Phosphotyrosine is estimated by measurement of absorbance at 450 nm.   The<br>
signal for controls is typically 0.6-1.2 absorbance units, with essentially no background in wells<br>
without the PGT substrate and is proportional to the time of incubation for 10 minutes.<br>
Inhibitors were identified by reduction of signal relative to wells without inhibitor and (CM<br>
values corresponding to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition are<br>
determined.  The compounds exemplified herein which correspond to formula 1 have ICgo<br>
values of 
The activity of the compounds of formula 1, in vivo, can be determined by the amount of inhibition of tumor growth by a test compound relative to a control. The tumor growth inhibitory effects of various compounds are measured according to the method of Corbett T.H., et al., Tumor Induction Relationships in Development of Transplantable Cancers of the Colon in Mice for Chemotherapy Assays, with a Note on Carcinogen Structure", Cancer Res., 35, 2434-2439 (1975) and Corbett T.H., et al., "A Mouse Colon-tumor Model for Experimental Therapy", Cancer Chemother. Rep. (Part 2)", 5, 169-186 (1975), with slight modifications. Tumors are induced in the left flank by subcutaneous (sc) injection of 1-5 million log phase cultured tumor cells (murine FRE-ErbB2 cells or human SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells) suspended in 0.1 ml RPM11640 medium. After sufficient time has elapsed for the tumors to become palpable (100-150 mm3 in size/5-6 mm in diameter) the test animals (athymic female mice) are treated with test compound (formulated at a concentration of 10 to 15 mg/ml in 5 Gelucire) by the intraperitoneal (ip) or oral (po) route of administration once or twice dally for 7 to 10 consecutive days. In order to determine an anti-tumor effect, the tumor is measured in<br>
millimeters'with a Vernier caliper across two diameters'and the tumor size (mm3) is calculated<br>
using the formula: Tumor size (mm3) = (length x [width]2)/2, according to the methods of<br>
Geran, R.I., et al. "Protocols for Screening Chemical Agents and Natural Products Against<br>
Animal Tumors and Other Biological Systems", Third Edition, Cancer Chemother. Rep.. 3,1-104<br>
(1972).  Results are expressed as perfcent inhibition, according to the formula: Inhibition (%) =<br>
(TuWcontroi - TuWtesO/TuWconiroi x 100%.    The flank site of tumor implantation provides<br>
reproducible dose/response effects for'a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, and the method of<br>
measuremeht (tumor,diameter) is a reliable method for assessing tumor growth rates.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active<br>
compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the 'compounds to the site<br>
of action. These .methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral Injection<br>
(including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal<br>
administration.	•<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject<br>
i<br>
being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage .is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while In other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention also provides kits for use by a consumer for treating disease. The kits comprise a) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention and a phamnaceutically acceptable carrier, vehicle or diluent; and b) instructions describing a method of using the pharmaceutical composition for treating the specific disease.<br>
A "kit" as used in the instant application includes a container for containing the separate unit dosage forms such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceuticaily acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a re-sealable bag (for example, to hold a "refill" of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle, which is in turn contained within a box.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in<br>
the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit<br>
dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like).  Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of<br>
relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material.  During<br>
the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size<br>
and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to<br>
1 accommodate multiple tablets and/or capsules to be packed.  Next, the tablets or capsules<br>
are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed<br>
against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opppsite from the direction in which the<br>
recesses were formed.   As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or<br>
collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil ahd the sheet.<br>
Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from<br>
the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed<br>
in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said<br>
opening.	,<br>
It maybe desirable to provide a written memory aid, where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or subject, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or a card which contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid<br>
is a calendar printed on the card e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday,"... etc	•<br>
"Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . ." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.<br>
Another specific embodiment of a kit Is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter, which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds the patient when the next dose is to be taken.<br>
In still another embodiment of the kits, the pharmaceutical composition may also comprise an additional compound that can be used in combination with a compound of the present invention, or the kit may comprise two pharmaceutical compositions: one containing a compound of the present invention and another containing an additional compound that can be used in combination with a compound of the present invention.<br>
The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other anti-tumor substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for<br>
example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cispfatin, carboplatin and cydophosphamide;<br>
anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for<br>
example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No.<br>
239362 such as J^-(5-|^-(3,4^ihydrc-2-methyI^H3xoquinazolin^-vlmemyl^-methylarnino]-2-<br>
thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor ihhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for<br>
example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for<br>
example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex™ (tamoxifen) or,, for example antirandrogens such as<br>
Casodex™ '	,	(4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3l-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable "'for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution,<br>
I	'<br>
suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. 'The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit do'sage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an , active ingredient. In addition, It may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
Administration of a combination of a compound of the present invention and an additional compound or additional compounds means that these compounds can be administered together as a composition or as part of the same unitary dosage form or in separate dosage forms, administered at the same time or at different times.<br>
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents,<br>
coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, etnanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.<br>

Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art For examples, see Rfimington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition<br>
(1975).<br>
The examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present inverition and methods of preparing such comppunds. It is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations., In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture. Those molecule's with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
Where HPLC chromatography is referred to in the preparations and examples below, it was performed using a Waters Alliance HPLC 'system (2690 + 996 photodiode array). Preparative HPLC was performed using a Waters 717 autosampler, 996 PDA, 600 controller. Other details regarding the chromatographic procedures are provided within the examples below.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be synthetically prepared according to the scheme 1 shown above or alternatively they may be prepared using biotransformation techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and as described below.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
General Method for Biotransformation<br>
A biotransformation can be achieved by those skilled in the art by contacting the substance to be transformed, and other necessary reactants with a variety of living microorganisms or the enzymes derived from them under conditions suitable for a chemical interaction to occur. Subsequently, the products of the reaction are separated and those of interest are purified for elucidation of their chemical structure and physical and biological properties. The enzymes can be present as: purified reagents, in crude extracts or lysates, in intact cells, in solution, in suspension, as covalently attached to a supporting surface, or imbedded in a-permeable matrix (e.g., agarose or alginate beads). The substrate and other necessary reactants (e.g., water, air, cofactors) are supplied as the chemistry dictates.<br>
Generally, the reaction is carried out in the presence of one or more liquid phases, aqueous and/or organic, to promote mass transfer of the reactants and products. The reaction may or may not be conducted aseptically. The conditions for monitoring the progress<br>
of the reaction and the isolation of the products of the reaction will vary according to the physical properties of the reaction system and the chemistry of the reactants and products, and such variations will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The following are two examples of a laboratory-scale method for carrying out aerobic biotransformations that can be exercis'ed by those skilled in the art to produce compounds of interest. ,   Nutrient medium (e.g.,  IOWA Medium: dextrose, yeast extract, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride; soybean flour, water; adjusted to neutral pH) is added to one or more culture vessels (e.g., fermentation tubes or flasks) and then steam-sterilized. Each vessel is aseptically inoculated with growth from.an agar culture, a suspension of washed cells or spores, or broth from a liquid nutrient medium culture of the biotransforming microorganism. The vessels are mounted on a shaker designed for fermentation and1 shaken (e.g., rotary operation at 100-300 rpm) at an appropriate temperature (e.g., 20-40°C) long enough to promote the growth of'the microorganism to a suitable population size (e.g., 1-3 days).   The parent compound io be transformed (i.e., substrate) is dissolved in water 'Or. a suitable water-miscible solvent (e.g., dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol). To each of the biotransformation vessels, the resulting solution is aseptically added to achieve the desired concentration of substrate (e.g., 0.1-0.2 mg/mL).  The dosed vessels &gt;are mounted on the shaker and'shaken as before, until the substrate has been converted to product(s) by microbial metabolism (e.g., 1-10 days).    The contents of the biotransformation vessel can be mechanically treated (e.g, by filtration or centrifugation) to separate undissolved solids and cells from the aqueous phase or extracted at a pH optimal for extraction of the desired compounds (water-immiscible organic solvents include, but are not limited to, methylene chloride or ethyl acetate). If separated, the solids can be extracted with a suitable water-miscible organic solvent (e.g., methanol). The solvent extract of the solids and the aqueous phase content from the vessels are recovered, combined, and concentrated using suitable methods, e.g., solid phase extraction and drying under reduced pressure. The dried crude is redissolved in a solvent that is compatible with the purification method (e.g., acetonitrile, methanol, water, or HPLC mobile phase).    Isolation and purification of the biotransformation product(s) can be achieved by, but not limited to, solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The biotransformation product(s) can be monitored during chromatographic separation for example by UV-absorbance and photodiode array spectral profile. Fractions of the HPLC mobile phase containing the product(s) of interest are retained and the product(s) is/are extracted from the mobile phase using suitable methods, e.g., vacuum drying followed by SPE or water-immiscible organic solvent extraction at a pH optimal for extraction of the desired compounds. The solvent eluate from SPE extraction is recovered, filtered to remove solids, and concentrated under reduced pressure to produce dried purified biotransformation<br>
product(s).    The chemical structure of the isolated product(s) is determined by mass<br>
spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).<br>

. Fifty milliliters (50 mL) of IOWA Medium (anhydrous dextrose, 20 g; yeast extract, 5 g; dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 5 g; sodium chloride, 5 g; soybean flour, 5 g; distilled water, 1 L; adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1N hydrochloric acid) were added to each of twenty-nine 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with foam plug closures and were steam-sterilized for 20 minutes at 15 psig and 121°C. Three flasks were aseptically inoculated with 0.5 mL of a cryogenically stored (-80°C) stock of Streptomyces albulus (ATCC 12757) mycelium. The inoculated flasks were mounted vertically on a rotary shaker (2-inch throw) and shaken at 210 rpm and 29°C for 2 days (inoculum stage). Then 5 ml of the inoculum stage culture was aseptically transferred to each of the remaining 26 flasks (biotransformation stage). The inoculated biotransformation flasks were mounted vertically on'a rotary shaker (2-inch throw) and shaken<br>
i<br>
at 210 rpm and 29°C for 2 days. The methanesulfonate salt of 2-Methoxy-N-(3-{4-[3-methyl-4-<br>
(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino]-quinazolin-6-yl}-allyl)-acetamide (i.e., substrate) was<br>
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (10 mg/mL). To each of the twenty-six biotransformation flasks,<br>
0.5 mL of the resulting solution was aseptically added to give an initial substrate concentration<br>
of 0.1 mg/mL (130 mg total in 26 flasks). The dosed flasks were remounted vertically on the<br>
rotary shaker and shaken at 210 rpm and 29°C for an additional 3 days. At the end of the 3-<br>
day biotransformation period, contents of the biotransformation flasks were combined.  The<br>
pH of the whole broth was adjusted to 8.5 with 1N sodium hydroxide. The resulting broth was<br>
extracted twice with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was concentrated<br>
using a rotary evaporator (40°C water bath) then taken to dryness under reduced pressure<br>
(Savant Speedvac, low heat, full vacuum setting). Dimethylsulfoxide (0.4 mL) was added to<br>
this residue which was then loaded onto a preconditioned Waters C18 SepPak (5 g) for solid<br>
phase extraction (the cartridge was preconditioned as per manufacturer's directions).  After<br>
loading, the column was washed with 24 mL distilled water followed by 24 mL of 25%<br>
methanol in water, then 24 mL of 50% methanol in water to remove unwanted material. The<br>
compound of interest was eluted with 24 mL 75% methanol in water. The 75% methanol in<br>
water fractions were dried under reduced pressure (Savant Speedvac, low temperature<br>
setting, full vacuum setting) overnight. Methanol was added to each of the tubes, combining<br>
the   residues   (approximately  0.6   mL)  for  reversed   phase   high   performance   liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC Method 1) to isolate the compound of interest.<br>

To a cooled (0°C) stirred suspension of NaH ( 4.8 g, 60%, 0.12 mol) in anhydrous DMF (60 ml) was added dropwise a solution of PhOH (11.3 g, 0.12 mol) in dry DMF (50 mL). After the addition, 4-chloro-6-iodoquinazoline (29 g, 0.1 mol) was added portionwise. Thereafter the cooling bath was removed and the resulting solution was stitrred at room<br>
temperature for 1.5 h, quenched with water (300 ml). The product precipitated and was extracted with EtOAc (400 ml). The separated organic layer was washed with aq. NaOH,<br>
i<br>
water, brine, dried over Na2S04 and concentrated to give 6-iodo-4-phenoxyquinazoline as off-white solid (32.9 g, 94%). Crystallization from EtOAc gave white soft and short needle crystals. A mixture of 6-iodo-4-phenoxyquinazoline (3.5 g, 10 mmol), as prepared in the preceding paragraph, methyl acrylate (6g, 70 mmol) , Pd(OAc)2 (140 mg, 0.62 mmol) and 1 Ph3P (320 mg, 1.22 mmol) in Et3N/DMF was purged with N2 and the pressure reaction vessel was tightly capped. The reaction was then heated on an oil-bath at 110°C,with stirring. Thin layer chromatography indicated that the reaction was complete after 3 hours. The product mixture was then transferred to a rqund bottomed flask and purged with a stream of N2 to remove the methyl acrylate. The residue was then dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with water, brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give crude E-3-(4-Phenoxy-quinazolin-6-yl)- acrylic acid methyl ester as yellow solid which was recrystallized from ethyl acetate 'to yield 2.3 g (70%) of pale yellow crystalline solid in two crops.<br>
A mixture of the product (E-3-(4-Phenoxy-quinazolin-6-yl)-acrylic acid methyl ester) from the preceding paragraph ( 307 mg, 1 mmol) and the desired aniline (215'mg, 1 mmol) was taken up In phenol (2 g) and the resultant mixture heated at 100°C on an oil-bath and a clear solution was obtained. After heating 20h, the brown solution was distilled under reduced pressure to remove phenol. The residue was partitioned between dilute NaOH and methylene chloride. The separated organic layer was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified by chromatography to give pure £-3-{4-[3-Methyl-4-(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino]-quinazoIin-6-yl}-acrylic acid methyl ester (480 mg).<br>
A mixture of the methyl ester (450 mg, 1 mmol) and LiOH'H2O (0.63 g, 15 mmol) in methanol/water (10/1 ml) was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling the reaction was neutralized with acetic acid (0.9 g, 15 mmol) in 2 mL of H2O to pH 6.0. A clear solution was obtained initially and the acid product precipitated later as a yellow solid, which was collected by vacuum filtration and dried to give the final product £-3-{4-[3-Methyl-4-(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino)-quinazolin-6-yl}-acrylic acid as a yellow solid (280 mg, 68%).<br>
