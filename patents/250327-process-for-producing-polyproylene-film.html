				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing a polypropylene film having a small dynamic coefficient of friction (CoF) and to a film obtained by this process. The invention further relates to the use of a polypropylene composition in a film forming process in order to reduce the required amount of slip agent for achieving a certain CoF and, alternatively, to the use of a polypropylene composition in a film forming process in order to reduce the required storage time for achieving a certain CoF.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Castfilm made of polypropylene has the disadvantage of very slow slip agent migration compared to e.g. polyethylene. Especially castfilms made of visbroken polypropylenes with a thickness of below 50µm do after production not have the small CoF which is required for a good winding quality and also for the following conversion steps. For a good winding quality a CoF of approx. 0.35 (depending on film properties and film thickness) and for conversion a CoF below 0.2 is technically necessary and therefore a market requirement.<br>
In order to fulfill this requirement it is state of the art to add slip agent (in combination with antiblocking agent) to the polypropylene cast film grades. The slip agent migrates to the surface of the film and creates a slippery film which lowers the CoF dramatically. Since the migration to the surface of the slip agent in polypropylene is very slow, an excessive amount of slip agent is added in order to overcome this problem and to obtain the required CoF immediately after film production for good winding quality. If less slip agent is added the CoF immediately after film production is too high and the film has to be stored for a long period (ca. 14 days) in order to achieve a sufficiently small CoF.<br>
The disadvantages of this solution are<br>
-	high costs due to excessive amount of slip agent<br>
-	deterioration of optical film properties after a longer period of time because too much slip agent migrates to the film surface.<br>
-	deposits of slip agent at the castfilm production line when films having a thickness of about 70 µm are produced.<br>
Object of Invention<br><br><br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a novel process for producing a polypropylene film, by polymerising propylene and optionally ethylene and/or one or more C4-C10 ct-olefins in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst to produce a polypropylene and subjecting the polypropylene to a film forming process. The produced film shall have a small dynamic coefficient of friction (CoF) (determined according to DIN 53 375, 24 hrs after production of film) compared to polypropylene films obtained from other processes (but containing - for reasons of comparability - the same amount of slip agent).<br>
Solution of Problem<br>
The above problem has surprisingly been solved by a process, where the Ziegler-Natta<br>
catalyst comprises an olefin polymerisation catalyst component in the form of particles<br>
having a predetermined size range, which olefin polymerisation catalyst component is<br>
obtained by<br>
preparing a solution of a complex of a Gp I la metal and an electron donor by reacting a<br>
compound of said metal with said electron donor or a precursor thereof in an organic<br>
liquid reaction medium;<br>
reacting said complex, in solution, with at least one compound of a transition metal to<br>
a)	produce an emulsion the dispersed phase of which contains more than 50 mol% of the<br>
Gp lla metal in said complex;<br>
maintaining the particles of said dispersed phase within the average size range 10 to 200 //m by agitation in the presence of an emulsion stabilizer and solidifying said particles; and recovering, washing and drying said particles to obtain said catalyst component or<br>
b)	to produce a denser oil phase which contains more than 50 mol% of the Gp lla metal in<br>
said complex and an oil phase immiscible therewith;<br>
preferentially sorbing said denser oil on a carrier having an average particle size of 10 to<br>
200 fjm and a pore volume of 0.5 to 4 ml/g;<br>
solidifying said sorbed oil contained by said carrier; and<br>
recovering, washing and drying the carrier to obtain said catalyst component.<br>
With this invention it is surprisingly either possible to use the slip agent in a smaller amount or - when the amount of slip agent is not reduced - to achieve the required CoF almost immediately after production due to accelerated slip agent migration. Furthermore<br><br>
the required CoF of 0.2 for conversion is obtained considerably sooner and no or less deterioration of optical properties of the film is observed since no excessive amount of slip agent is necessary. With this invention a considerable cost saving due to reducing the required amount of slip agent is possible.<br>
It has surprisingly been found, that films which are produced from polypropylenes, which are polymerised with the above described catalyst components apparently do show a very fast slip agent migration and have a very small CoF already 1 day after film production.<br>
If conventional catalysts are used for polymerisation of polypropylene, films therefrom may take from 3 to 7 days until a CoF is reached, which allows conversion of the films.<br>

General description of propylene (co)polymerisation<br>
The propylene polymer may be produced by single- or multistage process polymerisation of propylene or propylene and ct-olefin and/or ethylene such as bulk polymerisation, gas<br><br>
phase polymerisation, slurry polymerisation, solution polymerisation or combinations thereof using the catalysts and catalyst components as herein described. Those processes are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
A preferred process is a combination of bulk slurry loop reactor(s) and gas phase reactor(s). A homo- or copolymer can be made either in loop reactors or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactors. The polymer produced in this way may be transferred into another reactor, where e.g. a different propylene polymer is polymerised on top of the product of the first reactor, e.g. when propylene/cc-olefin rubber is polymerised. Preferably this polymerisation step is done in a gas phase polymerisation.<br>
One skilled in the art is aware of the various possibilities to produce propylene homo- and copolymers and will simply find out a suitable procedure to produce suitable polymers which are used in the present invention.<br>
Film production<br>
The polypropylene which is produced according to the invention can be converted into films with conventional methods:<br>
Cast film technology<br>
In this technology for producing polymer films, the molten polymer is extruded through a slot die fed by a (normally single-screw) extruder onto a first cooled roll, the so-called chill-roll. From this roll, the already solidified film is taken up by a second roll (nip roll or takeup roll) and transported to a winding device after trimming the edges.<br>
Blown film technology with water contact cooling ring<br>
In this technology for producing polymer films, the molten polymer is extruded through a tubular die fed by a (usually single-screw) extruder and blown up to a tube. The film tube has contact on the exterior side to a water cooling ring and is cooled down quickly. The already solidified film tube is flattened afterwards by take-up rolls and taken off to a winder.<br>
For a more detailed description see "Polypropylene Handbook", edited by Edward P. Moore, Jr., Manser Publishers, 1996.<br>
Monoaxially oriented PP film (MOPP)<br><br>
Based on a cast film, a solid-state orientation step below the melting temperature is applied before winding.<br>
Biaxially oriented PP film (BOPP)<br>
Two main technologies are used for this process, which are described in detail in A. Ajji &amp; M.M. Dumoulin, Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) process, in: J. Karger-Kocsis (Ed.) Polypropylene: An A-Z Reference, Kluwer, Dordrecht 1999, 60-67. Orientation and properties are determined by the draw ratio and details of the process; the films have generally the highest crystallinity and stiffness achievable.<br>
Polypropylene films require a certain maximum CoF, before further processing. Immediately after production the CoF is high (e.g. 0.7-1.0) and the film is stored to allow the slip agent (e.g. oleic acied amide and/or erucic acid amide) to migrate to the film surface. This results in a decrease of CoF and, when the CoF has reached a value of about 0.30 or below, the film can be further processed.<br>
Therefore, a further aspect of the invention relates to a method for reducing the necessary amount of slip agent which is necessary to achieve a CoF s 0.30 (ace. to DIN 53 375, 7 days after production of film).<br>
The reduction of slip agent is made possible by manufacturing the film from a<br>
polypropylene composition which comprises a polypropylene obtained by polymerising<br>
propylene and optionally ethylene and/or one or more C4-Ci0 a-olefins in the presence of<br>
a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, which catalyst comprises an olefin polymerisation catalyst<br>
component in the form of particles having a predetermined size range, which olefin<br>
polymerisation catalyst component is obtained by<br>
preparing a solution of a complex of a Qp Ha metal and an electron donor by reacting a<br>
compound of said metal with said electron donor or a precursor thereof in an organic<br>
liquid reaction medium;<br>
reacting said complex, in solution, with at least one compound of a transition metal to<br>
a) produce an emulsion the dispersed phase of which contains more than 50 mol% of the<br>
Gp Ha metal in said complex;<br>
maintaining the particles of said dispersed phase within the average size range 10 to 200<br>
fjm by agitation in the presence of an emulsion stabilizer and solidifying said particles; and<br>
recovering, washing and drying said particles to obtain said catalyst component<br>
or<br><br>
b) to produce a denser oil phase which contains more than 50 mol% of the Gp lla metal in<br>
said complex and an oil phase immiscible therewith;<br>
preferentially sorbing said denser oil on a carrier having an average particle size of 10 to<br>
200 fjtn and a pore volume of 0.5 to 4 ml/g;<br>
solidifying said sorbed oil contained by said carrier; and<br>
recovering, washing and drying the carrier to obtain said catalyst component.<br>
It has been found, that the typical amount of slip agent of 0.2 wt% can typically be reduced to about 0.1 wt% or even befow without necessitating a longer storage time. Reducing the amount of slip agent reduces the costs for the slip agent and it improves the optical qualities of the films and it also improves the applicability of the films for food applications.<br>
While it is a target to reduce the amount of slip agent in polypropylene films, it is equally desirable to reduce the storage time which is necessary to achieve a CoF to allow further processing of the films. Until now it was only possible to reduce storage times by increasing the amount of slip agent or by storing the films at higher temperatures. Both measures are costly and detrimental to some properties of the films.<br>
Therefore, a further aspect of the invention relates to a method for reducing the required storage time necessary to achieve a CoF £ 0.30 {ace. to DIN 53 375).<br>
The reduction of storage time is made possible by manufacturing the film from a<br>
polypropylene composition which comprises a polypropylene obtained by polymerising<br>
propylene and optionally ethylene and/or one or more C4-Cio a-olefins in the presence of<br>
a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, which catalyst comprises an olefin polymerisation catalyst<br>
component in the form of particles having a predetermined size range, which olefin<br>
polymerisation catalyst component is obtained by<br>
preparing a solution of a complex of a Gp lla metal and an electron donor by reacting a<br>
compound of said metal with said electron donor or a precursor thereof in an organic<br>
liquid reaction medium;<br>
reacting said complex, in solution, with at least one compound of a transition metal to<br>
a) produce an emulsion the dispersed phase of which contains more than 50 mol% of the<br>
Gp lla metal in said complex;<br>
maintaining the particles of said dispersed phase within the average size range 10 to 200<br>
/ym by agitation in the presence of an emulsion stabilizer and solidifying said particles; and<br>
recovering, washing and drying said particles to obtain said catalyst component<br>
or<br><br>
b) to produce a denser oil phase which contains more than 50 mol% of the Gp lla metal in<br>
said complex and an oil phase immiscible therewith;<br>
preferentially sorbing said denser oil on a carrier having an average particle size of 10 to<br>
200 //m and a pore volume of 0.5 to 4 ml/g;<br>
solidifying said sorbed oil contained by said carrier; and<br>
recovering, washing and drying the carrier to obtain said catalyst component.<br>
It has been found that with the typical load of slip agent of about 0.2 wt% can be reduced from the typical 7 or more days down to 3 days or less. In some cases the film has an acceptable CoF already 1 day after production.<br><br>
Description of measurement methods MFR<br>
The melt flow rates were measured with a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C. The melt flow rate is that quantity of polymer in grams which the test apparatus standardised to ISO 1133 extrudes within 10 minutes at a temperature of 230 °C under a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
Comonomer contents<br>
Comonomer   contents   (ethylene)   were   measured   with   Fourier  transform   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) calibrated with 13C-NMR.<br>
The dynamic Coefficient of Friction (CoF) as a measure of the frictlonal behaviour of the film was determined according to DIN 53 375 on film samples with a thickness of 30 ivm or 50 jwm (actual film thickness is indicated in table 1). Immediately after film production the film has been stored at room temperature (23°C) for 1, 3, 7,14, 21 and 28 days. Measurement of the CoF was then performed at 23°C.<br><br>

A magnesium complex solution was prepared by adding over a 40 minute period, with stirring, 110 ml of a 20% solution in toluene of BOMAG-A (Tradename) [Mg(Bu)i.5(Oct)o5] to 38.9 ml of 2-ethylhexanol which had been cooled to 5 °C in a 300 ml glass reactor. During the addition the reactor contents were maintained below 15 °C. The temperature was then raised to 60 °C and held at that level for 30 minutes with stirring, at which time reaction was complete. 6.4 ml phthaloyl chloride was then added over an 11 minute period. The reactor contents were stirred at 60 °C for 20 minutes, 12.9 ml 1 -chlorobutane was added, and stirring continued for another 15 minutes at 60 °C. The resulting stable, yellow Mg complex solution was cooled to room temperature.<br>
19.5 ml TiCI4, 10 ml n-pentane and 32.0 g of the above-prepared Mg complex solution were reacted with stirring at 25 °C in a 300 ml glass reactor. After 5 minutes, reaction was complete and a dark red emulsion had formed. To this emulsion were added 2.0 g of a 40 fjm particle size silica (silica SYLOPOL 55SJ, Grace) in 2.0 ml TiCI4 and the temperature of the mixture was raised to 90 °C over 30 minutes and maintained at that temperature, with stirring, for a further 30 minutes. After settling and syphoning the solids underwent washing with:<br>
1.100 ml toluene + 5 ml TiCI4 at 90 °C for 30 minutes;<br>
2.	60 ml heptane, at 90 °C for 10 minutes;<br>
3.	60 ml heptane, at 90 °C for 10 minutes;<br>
4.	60 ml pentane, at room temperature for 5 minutes; and<br>
5.	60 ml pentane, at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br><br>
The solids were then dried at 60 °C by nitrogen purge, to yield a yellow, air-sensitive powder.<br>
Example B<br>
Preparation of catalyst component B of film examples 1, 5 and 6<br>
A magnesium complex solution was prepared by slowly adding over a 40 minute period, with stirring, 110ml of a 20% solution in toluene of BOMAG-A (Tradename) [Mg(Bu), s(Oct)06] to 38.9 ml of 2-ethylhexanol which had been cooled to 5 °C in a 300 ml glass reactor. During the addition the reactor contents were maintained below 15 °C. The temperature was then raised to 60 °C and held at that level for 30 minutes with stirring, at which time reaction was complete. 6.4 ml phthaloyl chloride was then added over an 11 minute period. The reactor contents were stirred at 60 °C for 20 minutes, 12.9 ml 1-chlorobutane was added, and stirring continued for another 15 minutes at 60 °C. The resulting stable, yellowish Mg complex solution was cooled to room temperature.<br>
19.5 ml TiCI4, 5 ml heptane and 28.7 g of the above-prepared Mg complex solution were reacted at 25 °C in a 300 ml glass reactor. After 5 minutes, reaction was complete and a dark red emulsion had formed. The temperature was raised to 50 °C, 2 ml of Viscoplex 1 -254 (Tradename) (40-44% of acrylic polymer in base oil) was added, and the reactor contents were stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting stabilised emulsion was then heated to 90 °C, with stirring, for 10 minutes to solidify the particles forming the dispersed phase. After settling and syphoning the solids (2.6 grams) underwent washing with: 1.100 ml toluene at 90 °C for 30 minutes;<br>
2.	60 ml heptane, at 90 °C for 20 minutes;<br>
3.	60 ml heptane, at 35 °C for 10 minutes;<br>
4.	60 ml pentane, at 30 °C for 5 minutes; and<br>
5.	60 ml pentane, at 30 °C for 5 minutes.<br>
The solids were then dried at 60 °C by nitrogen purge.<br>
Example C<br>
Preparation of polymerisation catalyst C for film examples 2-4<br>
0.9 ml triethyl aluminium (TEA) (co-catalyst), 0.12 ml cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane (CMMS) as an external donor and 30 ml n-pentane were mixed and allowed to react for 5 minutes. Half of the mixture was then added to a polymerisation reactor and the other<br><br>
half was mixed with 20 mg of components prepared in Example A. After an additional 5 minutes the component TEA/donor/n-pentane mixture was added to the reactor. The AI/Ti mole ratio of the resulting polymerisation catalyst was 250 mol/mol and the AI/CMMS mole ratio was 10 mol/mol.<br>
Example D<br>
Preparation of polymerisation catalyst D for film examples 1,5 and 6<br>
0.9 ml triethyl aluminium (TEA) (co-catalyst), 0.12 ml cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxy silane (CMMS) as an external donor and 30 ml n-pentane were mixed and allowed to react for 5 minutes. Half of the mixture was then added to a polymerisation reactor and the other half was mixed with 20 mg of the components prepared in Example B. After an additional 5 minutes the component TEA/donor/n-pentane mixture was added to the reactor. The AI/Ti mole ratio of the resulting polymerisation catalyst was 250 mol/mol and the AI/CMMS mole ratio was 10 mol/mol.<br>
Catalysts for Comparative Examples<br>
MC L1, the catalyst which is used in comparative examples 1, 2, 5 and 6 is commercially available from BASELL.<br>
Preparation of polymerisation catalyst E for comparative film examples 3 and 4<br>
1100 kg of TiCI« was fed to a reactor and cooled to -20 °C. 77 kg of MgCfe carrier obtained by spray-crystallizing MgCI2(C2H5OH)n melt was suspended in 223 kg aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (bp. 90 -110 °C) and cooled before adding it to the cold TiCI4. Controlled heating to 130 °C was performed. During heating di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate (OOP) was added, and transesterification (OOP to DEP, diethyl phthalate) effected by keeping the mixture for 30 minutes at 130 °C. The solid was separated by filtration. The procedure was repeated 3 times, each repeat adding the TiCI4 to the filtered solid recovered from the previous titanation. The catalyst, resulting from the third repeat, was washed 4 times with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent and dried in vacuum to free flowing powder.<br>
Preparation of propylene polymers for film examples Example 1<br>
The catalyst C was used in a polymerisation reaction in a 5 litre reactor at 70 °C. 60 mmol Hydrogen and 1400 g propylene were fed to the reactor. A TEA/CMMS solution (AI/Ti ratio<br><br>
of 250/1 mol/mol; AI/Donor ratio of 10/1 mol/mol) was fed to the reactor together with 20 mg catalyst. The duration of the polymerisation was 60 minutes. During the polymerisation ethylene has been continuously added. The total amount of ethylene added was 40 g. The resulting propylene polymer had an MFR of 1.6g/10min and an ethylene content of 3.5 wt%.<br>
Example 2<br>
The catalyst C was used in a polymerisation reaction in a 5 litre reactor at 70 °C. 60 mmol Hydrogen and 1400 g propylene were fed to the reactor. A TEA/CMMS solution (AI/Ti ratio of 250/1 mol/mol; AI/Donor ratio of 10/1 mol/mol) was fed to the reactor together with 20 mg catalyst. The duration of the polymerisation was 60 minutes. During the polymerisation ethylene has been continuously added. The total amount of ethylene added was 40 g. The resulting propylene polymer had an MFR of 1.5 g/10 min and an ethylene content of 4.9 wt%.<br>
Example 5<br>
The catalyst D was used in a polymerisation reaction in a 5 litre reactor at 70 °C. 250 mmol Hydrogen and 1400 g propylene were fed to the reactor. A TEA/CMMS solution (AI/Ti ratio of 250/1 mol/mol; AI/Donor ratio of 10/1 mol/mol) was fed to the reactor together with 20 mg catalyst. The duration of the polymerisation was 60 minutes. During the polymerisation ethylene has been continuously added. The total amount of ethylene added was 40 g. The resulting propylene polymer had an MFR of 4.9 g/10 min and an ethylene content of 3.4 wt%.<br>
The polymerisation procedures for the other examples and for the comparative examples were performed analogously to the procedures above, except that the amounts of hydrogen, ethylene, propylene and other polymerisation parameters were varied in order to achieve the MFR and ethylene contents as specified in table 1 and the respective catalyst which is indicated in the table was used.<br>
Vlsbreaking and Compounding<br>
The powders and the additives were mixed together in a Henschel-mixer and compounded at a twin screw extruder at a temperature of 250 °C. For visbreaking from the basic melt flow rate to a melt flow rate of about 7 to 9 g/10 min di-tert-butylperoxide<br><br>
was added during the compounding step. The strands were quenched in cold water and pelletized.<br>
Film forming examples<br>
The process for production of cast films is a widely used technique. A description of the process is published in "Polypropylene Handbook", edited by Edward P. Moore, Jr., Manser Publishers, 1996<br>
For production of the films for the examples and comparative examples a single screw extruder (supplied by Plamex Maschinenbau GmbH, Kelberg/Germany) having a diameter (D) of 30 mm and a screw length of 20D equipped with a T-die was used under the conditions of a cylinder temperature of 250 °C, a die temperature of 260 °C and a chill roll temperature of 15 °C to produce mono layer films with a thickness of 30 //m and 50 //m, resp.<br>
CoF values were measured at the indicated storage times. The CoF values are shown in table 1<br><br>
