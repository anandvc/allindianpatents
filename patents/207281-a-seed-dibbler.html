This invention relates to a seed dibbler which is used for the planting of seeds in agriculture, horticulture and forestry•<br>
The term •dibble1 refers to a pointed instrument employed in making holes in the ground for planting of seeds, bulbs etc. and in the verb form refers to the act of preparing the soil using said pointed instruments.   There are therefore, at least three terms used in the art,  'dibble', 'dibber' and 'dibbler' which are synonymous and all refer to said pointed instruments. In this specification, the term 'dibbler' is uniformly used and is intended to cover the other terms mentioned hereinabove and any others that are also used in the art*  In the specification hereinbelow, a dibbler is a device for cutting or loosening or -upturning of the soil and for dropping seeds in said cut, loosened or upturned soil.   In this specification hereinafter, the term 'cutting1 is only used and is intended to refer to 'said cutting and/or loosening and/or upturning of soil.  2?or said cutting of soil a dibbler is provided with --either a pointed end and/or with a cutting edge*<br>
A hoe is also a tool used for loosening of soil or for scraping up weeds and usually comprises a thin transverse metal blade located at one end of a long handle*  In the specification hereinbelow, the term 'hoe' is used to refer to that portion of a dibbler adapted to cause said cutting of soil and may comprise the end portion of said dibbler said end portion bein^ adapted for cutting into the soil*<br><br>
In the simplest of seeding operations, a farmhand makes a hole in the soil using a s^all hand tool and drops one or more seeds in said hole and then pushes 'the   soil back over the hole* The soil over the hole may then be compacted somewhat by the farmhand stamping on it or by pressing with another hand tool.<br>
In another method of seeding a pipe is used.  A pipe is cut diagonally, that is, in a plane not perpendicular to the axis thereof but at an inclination thereto between 0° and 90° such as to form a cutting edge for said cutting of soil.  Said diagonally cut pipe is used to cut the soil by pressing said cut end into the soil.   Said pipe is then withdrawn and the soil lodged in the said cut end thereof* is dislodged by means of a ramrod*   The pipe is then aligned over the hole in the soil and one or more seeds are dropped into the pipe, which seeds then roll down the pipe into the hole.  The farmhand then stamps with his foot/feet to close said hole and compact the soil thereupon.  Said pipe may be of metal or other materials. More often, a hollowed out bamboo is used for this purpose.<br>
It will be observed that said another method of seeding provides considerable improvement over' said simplest method which is slow, cumbersome and tiring.   The merit of said another method is that is is simple and employs simple, easy to fabricate and economical tool.  However, said another method has certain drawbacks  chief of, which are:<br>
i.  the process of seeding is slow and time consuming; and ii. the process of manually closing each hole by stamping is quite slow, laborious and tiring.<br><br>
It is the object of this invention to remove or minimise these drawbacks and with this object in view, this invention offers a novel, modified dibbler which is easier and quicker to pperate; requires less operational steps; is compact and lightweight and quite simple and economical to manufacture and furthermore the<br>
*<br>
said cutting edge thereof is more durable and longer lasting.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, there is provided a dibbler for the planting of seeds in agriculture, horticulture and forestry comprising a pipe member provided with a hoe at one end thereof and a container for holding said seeds at the other end thereof; and a rotary feeder, located along said pipe<br>
member, comprising a cylindrical member&gt;rotatably mounted in<br>
having a cylindrical housing, and/one or more cavities located on the<br>
surface thereof, said cavitie(s) being disposed such that,<br>
upon rotation of said cylindrical member said seeds discharge<br>
from said container into said cavitie(s) and thereafter f**om<br>
said cavitie(s) down said pipe member into the soil.<br>
Within the scope of the abovementioned statement of invention. a wide variation is feasible in various parameters such as materials of construction of various parts of the device, shape, eise and dimensions thereof and whether the. device and/or parts thereof are machined, cast or welded or made in other manner. Some of said variations in parameters are described hereinbelow without affecting the scope of the invention*<br>
*        » The pipe member can be a hollowed out piece of bamboo or<br>
any metal or alloy  or' other materials.   In the embodiment<br>
described in detail hereinbelow the pipe member is of galvanised<br>
iron.<br><br>
The seed container may be a conical or cylindrical hopper  or bottle shaped and made of glass orpfchexr materials.  The use of other types and shapes of containers is feasible and can be easily adapted to the device of the invention*   In the embodiment described in detail the container is in the form of cylindrical transparent bottle made of plastics, the lid thereof being bolted to a disc attached to said pipe member, holes being provided in said lid and disc for the flow of seeds from the container to the pipe member*   The container in the embodiment described in detail is screwed to the lid but other fixing methods such as flanges, tapered connections, clips or others can be easily and simply adapted to the device of the invention*<br>
The rotary feeder comprises a short length of cross pipe which is joined to said pipe member and fbrme said cylindrical housing within which said cylindrical member is rotatably mounted*  Said cross pipe therefore extends a short distance on each side of said pipe member such as to form the shape of a cross*  Said PTOBB  pipe may be of the same diameter as that of the pipe member or larger or smaller although difficulties ' arise in fabrication and operation when said cross pipe dia» is too small in comparison to that of said pip# member.  In the embodiment described in detail, the diameters of said cross pipe and said pipe member are equal*  Por the sake of economy,<br>
both eaid cross pipe(cylindrical housing) and the cylindrical<br>
*	*<br>
member are unmachined components*   Howevelr, machined components may also be used to provide better fit and smoother operation. The provision of a rotary feeder in the dibbler of the invention is novel*<br><br>
Said cylindrical member is provided with cavities on the surface thereof to receive seeds from said container, which seeds upon rotation of said cylindrical member discharge into the lower portion of said pipe member.   If only one said cavity is provided a 360° rotation of said cylindrical member is required for each seed discharge whereas with two said cavities located symmetrically only a 180° turn is necessary for each said discharge.   A two cavity system is most practical and is the one adopted in the embodiment described in detail hereinbelow.  The more the number of cavities incorporated the greater will be the required diameter for said cylindrical member and that of the cross pipe, that ist the cylindrical housing.<br>
The diameter of said cross pipe is also dependent on the diameter of the mouth of said cavities.   If said mouth diameter is small more such cavities can be accomodated without recourse to increase of diameter of 6aid cylindrical member.  Said cavity mouth diameter is also dependent on the range of sizes of the seeds expected to be used in the dibbler.  In the embodiment described in detail, the cavity mouth diameter is substantially . equal toe the inside diameter of said pipe member.  The cavity^ dimensions are formulated based on the, shape and si&amp;e of the. seeds to be planted and the quantity required to be discharged with each discharge operation of the rotary feeder.   Said cavities may be substantially cylindrical&gt; or conical or hemispherical ±nc  configuration*  In the embodiment described in detail, the two cavities are substantially,hemispherical.<br>
Said cylindrical member is anchored within said cross pipe (cylindrical housing) by screw means located at one end thereof<br><br>
a handle or knob being provided at the other end fox* rotation thereof.  Other means of fixing said cylindrical member such as flanges may   also be used* In the embodiment described in detail screw means have been used for anchoring said cylindrical member within said cross pipe( cylindrical housing) » with the object of providing an economical device which is also easy to fabricate.<br>
A first handle means is desirable at the top of the device of the invention or along the length of said pipe member to enable the device to be conveniently carried from place to place.  A second handle means is required by means of which pressure may be applied on said pipe member such that the  hoe thereof may cut into the soil and provide a hole for said seed(s).  In the embodiment described in detail, said first and second handle means are combined into  one inverted U-shaped member which is attached to said pipe member.   Said U-shaped member iiay Bisrvecone or more cross arms perpendicular to said pipe member such that pressure may be applied to the device of the invention by means thereof to drive said hoe into the soil*  In the embodiment described hereinbelow, two said cross arms have been provided.<br>
If said pipe member is provided with a cut end, cut in a diagonal direction which is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the axis of said pipe member, said cut end forms a very effective hoe.  A smaller angle of said diagonal cut(with respect to said axis) gives a longer and more pointed hoe enabling deeper penetration of soil.  This invention provides<br><br>
for such a hoe formed by said diagonal cut at the lower end of said pipe member.<br>
Within the scope of the invention is the arrangement  of a<br>
separate hoe which is attached to said pipe member at the lower<br>
end thereof.   Said separate hoe may be of a metallic material<br>
and is generally in the form of a knife having a cutting edge<br>
such that the soil is cut by a downward followed by a forward<br>
movement of the dibbler of the invention. Said  separate hoe<br>
may be substantially straight or the lower end thereof may be<br>
bent in the forward direction.  Said  Kofe ?may: either-   .-""'■<br>
have be pointed for facilitating penetration into the soil or/a cutting<br>
edge for said cutting or both.   In the embodiment described<br>
in detail, a separate hoe is provided which is attached by<br>
end welding to the lower/of said pipe member.   This arrangement<br>
of a separate hoe attached to said pipe member is novel*<br>
In order to provide a clearer understanding of the invention an embodiment thereof will now be described in detail hereinbelow, by way of example, and without limitation to the scope of the invention, by reference to the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Pig» 1 shows a front view of the device of the invention; Pig. 2 shows a side view of the device of the invention;  and Pig* 3 shows detail of the rotary ,feeder.<br>
Reference numeral 1 in the figures denotes said pipe member which comprises a galvanised iron pipe.   Disc 2 is welded to the top end of said pipe member 1 •  The lid 3 9f seed container 4 is bolted to said disc 2 and the container containing seeds to be sowed is screwed into said lid 3.  Both lid 3 and disc 2 have circular openings to enable seeds to drop into pipe member 1 from<br><br>
container 4.  Gross pipe 5 which is welded to pipe member 1 forms<br>
said cylindrical housing and extends on both sides thereof to<br>
form a cross shape.  The cylindrical member 6 is rotatably mounted<br>
inside said cross pipe 5 and is anchored by bolt means 7 at<br>
one end thereof.   Said (Cylindrical member 6 is further provided<br>
with a knob 3 located at the other end thereof for rotation<br>
thereof.<br>
Said seed cavities 9 are located on the surface of said cylindrical member 6 said cavities being substantially hernia-spherical in shape•   Two said cavities 9 are provided on said cylindrical member 6 at 180°  angular spacing thereof such that every  half turn of the knob 8 causes the discharge of a cavity-full of seeds down said pipe member 1 and into the soil from the open lower end thereof.<br>
At the bottom end of said pipe member 1 is located a curved hoe 10 which comprises a  curved knife-like metallic piece having a cutting edge 11 and also a pointed end 12»  When pressure is applied on the dibbler of the invention said curved hoe 10 cuts into the soil to cause a hole to be formed -into which the seeds ax*e discharged when the knob 8 is rotated • Said curved hoe 10 is bent in the forward direction at the lower end thereof.<br>
Pressure on pipe member 1 during operation of the device of the invention is applied by pressing or leaning on handle 13  ; which comprises an inverted U-shaped member having substantially horizontal cross members 14*   The arms 15  of said U-shaped member (handle) 13 are attached to the pipe member 1.  The handle 13 also allows carrying the device conveniently from one plac e to another•<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a seed dibbler which, is used for the planting of seeds in agriculture, horticulture and forestry*<br>
The term 'dibblef refers to a pointed instrument employed in making holes in the ground for planting of seeds, bulbs etc. and in the verb form refers to the act of preparing the soil using said pointed instruments*   There are therefore, at least three terms used in the art,  •dibble1, •dibber* and 'dibbler1 which are synonymous and all refer to said pointed instruments* In this specification, the term 'dibbler1 is uniformly used and is intended to cover the other terms mentioned hereinabove and any others that are also used in the art.  In the specification hereinbelow, a dibbler is a device for cutting or loosening or upturning of the soil and for dropping seeds in said cut, loosened or upturned soil.   In this specification hereinafter, the term 'cutting1 is only used and is intended to refer to said cutting and/or loosening and/or upturning of soil.  Por said cutting of soil a dibbler is provided with tftither a pointed end and/or with a cutting edge.<br>
A hoe is also a tool used for loosening of soil or for scraping up weeds and usually comprises a thin transverse metal blade located at one end of a long handle©  In the specification hereinbelow, the term 'hoe1 is used to refer to that portion of a dibbler adapted to cause said cutting of soil and may comprise the end portion of said dibbler said end portion being<br>
