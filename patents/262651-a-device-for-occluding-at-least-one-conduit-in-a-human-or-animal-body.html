METHODS AND DEVICES FOR CONDUIT OCCLUSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to methods and devices for occluding conduits. In particular, the present invention is directed to methods and devices for delivery of compositions that lead to occlusion of conduits and for later re-opening of such occluded conduits.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the medical and research fields, there are many clinical situations where it is desired or necessary to stop the passage, flow or transfer of substances within a body tube or conduit by causing an occlusion or blockage. It is often desirable for the occlusion to be re-opened at a later time. Unfortunately, many occlusion techniques are often harmful or potentially harmful and are not reversible to accommodate changes in the needs or desires of patients.<br>
One area that has a need for reversible occlusion of a body tube is the control of fertility. Over the last 50 years, the world has experienced the highest rates of population growth and the largest annual population increases recorded in history. Women account for over 50% of the world's population and play a critical role in family health, nutrition, and welfare. One of the most significant areas in need of attention and innovation in women's healthcare is that of contraception, where the reproductive aged woman is currently faced with sub-optimal alternatives.<br>
Over the past 20 years, couples in every world region have adopted contraception with increasing frequency as a means of regulating the timing and number of children. However, in the less developed countries there are still a substantial number of women, who wish to control fertility but are not presently using contraception. Many governments worldwide are intervening with policies to provide access to contraceptive methods to control over-population. In 2000, it was estimated that 123 million women did not have access to safe and effective means of contraception. Therefore, the potential for a suitable contraceptive system has widespread implications for the world population.<br>
Today there are several contraceptive options available, although currently available options are associated with specific limitations. Some contraceptive options include surgical intervention, such as tubal ligation for female sterilization and vasectomy for male sterilization,<br>
L<br>
both of which are invasive and considered non-reversible.   Other options available to women are hormonal contraceptives, which are not suitable or safe for a number of women.  Further<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
options include intrauterine devices that may have significant side effects. The ideal contraceptive system is one that would provide an immediately effective, reversible, non-hormonal, non-surgical, easy to deliver, office-based solution that does not require anesthesia, patient compliance, or special equipment, and does not leave a foreign body in place long-term. None of the current options meets these requirements.<br>
The most widely utilized method of permanent contraception is tubal ligation or female surgical sterilization. There are a number of major drawbacks associated with tubal ligation. The procedure is permanent and invasive, requires general anesthesia, has a long recovery time, and can result in post-tubal ligation syndrome. Post-tubal ligation syndrome occurs when the surgeon closing the fallopian tube inadvertently damages or destroys blood vessels to the ovaries causing post-menopausal symptoms of abnormal bleeding, memory loss, confusion, mood swings, and lack of sex drive. In addition, a recent study has found that of all the hormonal and non-hormonal methods of birth control, tubal sterilization has the greatest association with development of functional ovarian cysts. Further, women who undergo tubal ligation frequently express regret or seek reversal. Reversal of tubal ligation, when attempted, is difficult, costly, and frequently unsuccessful.<br>
On the other end of the spectrum, the most widely utilized method of non-surgical contraception is the administration of hormonal drugs, such as implanted hormones or birth ' control pills. This method of contraception is effective only so long as hormones are administered or birth control pills taken according to a specific regimen. Although widely used, this method of contraception is not suitable or safe for all women. In addition, there is a high failure rate resulting in unintended pregnancies due to patient non-compliance with the daily regimen of taking pills.<br>
One reversible contraceptive device currently available is the intrauterine device (IUD). There are an estimated 85 to 100 million women worldwide using this method, substantiating the importance of reversibility. However, given the possible health risks associated with IUDs and patient reluctance to have a foreign body in place for an extended period of time, fewer than 1 million women in the U.S. use this method, and many manufacturers have ceased distribution of these devices. The health risks include unplanned expulsion requiring removal due to excessive pain or bleeding, pelvic-inflammatory disease, permanent infertility, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and even death.<br>
While the currently available compositions and methods for contraception represent a significant advancement in the art, further improvements would be desirable to provide safe,<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
effective and reversible non-surgical devices, compositions, and methods for preventing pregnancy. It would be beneficial if these devices, compositions and methods provided an immediately effective, non-hormonal, non-surgical, easy to deliver, office-based solution mat did not require anesthesia or patient -compliance with a daily regimen. It would be further beneficial if these devices, compositions and methods did not require special equipment to undertake a contraceptive procedure or require a foreign body remaining in place over a long period of time. It would be further beneficial if these devices, compositions and methods were suitable to reversal. Some or all of these advantages of an ideal contraceptive system are provided by the devices, systems, compositions and methods of the present invention.<br>

WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
or means for opening an occlusion, and any other components necessary for the full functioning of the delivery system.<br>
In general, the methods of the present invention comprise administration of delivery systems that deliver compositions that are capable of occluding conduits. The delivery systems comprise devices that are capable of delivering occlusive compositions to the desired site. Disclosed herein are exemplary methods, delivery systems, and compositions for occlusion of conduits of the reproductive tracts of mammals. Such methods and compositions can be used in other physiological systems and biological sites of humans or other animals, and delivery systems for such biological sites are contemplated by the present invention.<br>
The present invention also comprises methods for opening, generally the re-opening, of occluded conduits. The methods comprise means for removal of the occlusion, including removal of occluding compositions or for formation of openings or channels through or around one or more occluded regions. Means of removal include, but are not limited to, physical withdrawal of the occluding composition, destruction of the occluding composition using physical, chemical or biological means, canalization of the one or more occluded regions, and placement of new conduits, such as stents or bypass materials to restore functionality to the formerly occluded region. Disclosed herein, are exemplary methods, delivery systems and compositions for removal of the occlusion of conduits of the reproductive tracts of mammals to restore fertility functionality. Such restorative methods and compositions can be used in other physiological systems and biological sites of humans or other animals, and delivery systems for such biological sites are contemplated by the present invention.<br>
One aspect of the present invention comprises methods of contraception for mammalian females that uses ultrasound visualization of a delivery system that delivers a resorbable composition to a target site, for example, from the cornual aspect of the uterus into each fallopian tube, wherein the composition is capable of creating an occlusion in each fallopian tube.<br>
A further aspect comprises using the delivery system to implant occlusive material. One aspect comprises methods that use ultrasound for visualization and positioning of the device and monitoring and confirming the placement of the composition when an ultrasound visible composition is used. The method comprises introduction of the device, including inserting the shaft of the introducer through the cervix until the atraumatic tip contacts the uterine fundus as determined by non-invasive visualization such as ultrasound or through the sensation of the operator.  When the tip is appropriately placed, optionally, the operator may<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
engage a member that aids in stabilizing the delivery device, referred to herein as a delivery device stabilizer. For example, this member may be a depth stop, a member which indicates that the tip is in position and the introducer shaft should be not be introduced any further, and includes, but is not limited to, other delivery device stabilizers such as those shown in Figures 4 and 5, or more than one member that aids in stabilization. With the introducer in position, each of two double-lumen balloon catheters is introduced through an introducer channel until it exits the channel in the shaft of the introducer, and the tip of the catheter is located within the uterine cornua as determined by ultrasound.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention comprises methods wherein each catheter undergoes the following steps. At a proximal end of the catheter, one end of the catheter which is near the handle and distant from the delivery end of the catheter, a cartridge containing balloon distension medium is connected to the balloon fitting, the stopcock is opened, and the distension medium is delivered to effect inflation of the balloon positioned at the delivery end of the catheter. The stopcock is then closed and the cartridge is disconnected from the fitting. At a proximal end of the catheter, a cartridge containing the occlusive composition is-then connected to the delivery catheter fitting, the material is delivered through the catheter and out of the delivery end of the catheter that is at or adjacent to the delivery site. The material may be delivered directly to the target site or may move from the delivery site to the target site location, and the material cures to form the occlusion. Once the material has at least partially cured into an occlusion, the balloon is deflated. Each catheter is retracted until it is housed within the introducer shaft or fully removed from the introducer. If necessary, the delivery device stabilizer is disengaged. The delivery system is then withdrawn from the patient leaving only the occlusion in place. The occlusive material may be delivered sequentially or simultaneously to the two fallopian tubes. The device is designed for delivery of occlusive compositions to two separate sites with minimal to no repositioning and without removal of the device, including the introducer, until the procedure is complete. One or both of the delivery catheters may be retracted into the introducer without repositioning or removal of the entire device.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention comprises a delivery system for implantation of the occlusive composition into the fallopian tubes comprising" a delivery device comprising an introducer with two channels, optionally one or more delivery device stabilizers, a housing means which may function as a handle if needed, means for attachment of one or more containers of balloon distension medium and the occlusive composition, and two catheters for delivery of the occlusive composition. The catheters may comprise an end structure, which<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
is a balloon or other similarly functioning member that may hold the catheter in position, prevents leakage of the material from the target site or performs both functions. The reclusive composition may be mixed prior to delivery and then delivered from the container through the catheters to one or more target sites.<br>
One aspect of the present invention comprises a delivery system comprising an introducer, one or more catheters wherein each may have a distinct function or design, and one or more cartridge components wherein each cartridge may have a distinct design and contain a distinct material.<br>
Now referring to Figure 1A, an exemplary embodiment of an introducer is shown comprising the following subcomponents: the introducer tip (1) which is shaped for atraumatic insertion through the cervix; the introducer shaft (3), generally a structure which may be cylindrical in nature, which contains two introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft; a delivery device stabilizer (4) which in this example indicates the position of the tip relative to the point of entry, which may be measured based on markings along the shaft and which may further serve to hold the introducer in position; a handle (5) which has an ergonomic design for gripping by the operator; and a pair of catheter insertion holes (6) through which the delivery catheters can be inserted into the introducer and guided to the introducer shaft catheter channels (2). The delivery device stabilizer (4) shown in this example is a depth stop.<br>
Figure 1B shows a delivery catheter for delivery of occlusive material, said catheter comprising the following subcomponents: the delivery end (7) of the catheter through which the occlusive material is delivered to the target site; a balloon (8) which may hold the catheter in position and may prevent leakage of the occlusive material away from the target; the shaft of the catheter (9) which, in this figure, features a pre-formed curve designed to aid in movement of the delivery end of the catheter from the introducer shaft into the cornual aspect of the uterus, - and includes two lumens, one for inflation of the balloon and one for delivery of the occlusive material; a bifurcation (10) of the catheter lumens; a fitting (11) that mates with a cartridge that contains flowable material to be delivered, such as the occlusive material; and a fitting with a stopcock (12) that mates with a cartridge that contains flowable material to be delivered, such as distension media for inflation and deflation of the balloon. One aspect of the present invention comprises a delivery catheter that is a double lumen delivery catheter. It should be understood that the delivery catheter may comprise a number of features and designs known in<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
the art for catheters and that would be useful for the function of the delivery system. In one embodiment of the present invention, the one or more catheters are disposed within the hollow introducer shaft. The catheters of the present invention may be single lumen or dual lumen catheters, or other catheters that would function in the present invention. One aspect of the invention comprises a stopcock which is used to prevent leakage of the balloon distension medium after placement It should be understood mat other devices, such as a valve or diaphragm, including a self-sealing diaphragm, may also serve the same function and be useful in obtaining and maintaining inflation of the balloon of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1C shows a cartridge 04) which may contain a flowable material (16) wherein the cartridge component comprises the following aspects: the tip of the cartridge {15) that mates with the delivery catheter fitting (11) or a fitting with stopcock (12) as required; the barrel of the cartridge (17); a plunger (18) that fits with the barrel of the cartridge (17) so as to form a seal to prevent back-flow of flowable material, said plunger allowing the operator to deliver the flowable material; and a flowable material (16), wherein the flowable material may comprise occlusive material or distension media.<br>
Now referring to Figures 2A-2C, wherein a schematic is shown of an exemplary embodiment of a method for deploying and using the exemplary delivery system shown in Figure 1 to effect an occlusion in both fallopian tubes of a mammal. It should be understood that not all steps need be performed in every deployment. Further, it should be understood that additional steps may be added as determined by one skilled in the art as necessary to increase performance, efficacy, or comfort of the subject undergoing the method depicted in Figure 2.<br>
In Figure 2A, the operator holds the introducer handle (5) and inserts the shaft of the introducer (3) through the cervix (20) until the atraumatic tip (1) contacts the uterine fundus (19) as determined by tactile feel, non-invasive visualization such as ultrasound, or a combination of both tactile feel and non-invasive visualization. When the atraumatic tip (1) is appropriately placed, the introducer shaft catheter channels (2) are located such that the openings are directed toward the uterine comua (24). Following contact of the atraumatic tip (1) with the uterine fundus (19), the delivery device stabilizer (4) is moved into position. In one embodiment, the delivery device stabilizer (4) may comprise components or structures that function to ensure that the operator maintains a fixed position of the introducer shaft, for example for preventing uterine perforation, as well as maintaining the position of the shaft catheter channels (2) throughout the procedure. In another embodiment, the delivery device stabilizer (4) may comprise components or structures to provide a depth stop mechanism to the<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
delivery device. In still another embodiment, the delivery device stabilizer comprises components or structures to provide a depth stop mechanism and stabilization to the delivery device.<br>
Figure 2B depicts the use of the delivery system for the introduction of an in situ curing flowable occlusive material. With the introducer in position, the operator moves each of two double-lumen catheters through a catheter insertion hole (6) through the introducer shaft catheter channels until each catheter exits the introducer shaft catheter channel (2), and the delivery end (7) of the catheter is located within the uterine cornua (24) as determined by the operator's tactile feel, non-invasive imaging such as ultrasound, or a combination of feel and imaging. An exemplary embodiment of a double lumen catheter is described in Figure 1B. Once the delivery end (7) of the catheter is positioned within the uterine cornua (24), the catheter position may be maintained by a locking mechanism which may be attached to the handle at or near the catheter insertion hole (6), at another location within the handle, or by a mechanism that is separate from the handle and which serves to grab, clamp, hold or otherwise stabilize the catheter such that it does not move and such that the delivery end remains in the target location. In another aspect of the invention, inflation of the balloon as described below is sufficient to maintain position of the catheter, and no additional locking mechanism may be required. A cartridge (14) containing balloon distension medium (22), which has been previously prepared or mixed if such mixing is necessary, is then fitted to a fitting with a stopcock (12), the stopcock is opened, and the distension medium (22) delivered to effect inflation of the balloon (8). Distension medium may comprise any flowable or liquid material suitable for inflation of the balloon (8), such material being chemically compatible with the material of the balloon (8) and may be biologically compatible in the event distension medium is introduced into the uterine cavity or fallopian tubes. Exemplary distension media include, but are not limited to, air and sterile isotonic saline solution. Following inflation of the balloon (8), the stopcock is then closed, the cartridge disconnected from the fitting (12), and the procedure repeated to inflate the balloon on the contralateral side. The balloons may be distended simultaneously using two cartridges. A cartridge (14) containing a flowable occlusive material (23) is then connected to the delivery catheter fitting (11), and the plunger (18) is pressed into the barrel (17) of the cartridge to deliver the flowable occlusive material (23) into and through the catheter, and exiting through the delivery end of the catheter (7) toward the target location for example, where it cures in situ.   As depicted in Figure 2B,<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
occlusive material has been dispensed in the target area and has begun to cure in situ, forming an occlusion (25).<br>
Figure 2C shows the device at completion of the procedure. Once the flowable occlusive composition has reached the appropriate stage of curing, from beginning to cure to substantially curing into an occlusion (25), the operator uses the distension medium cartridge to deflate each balloon, withdrawing the distension medium into the cartridge. Each catheter is retracted until it is housed within the introducer shaft (3) or, as shown in Figure 2C, fully removed from the introducer. If necessary, the delivery device stabilizer (4) is disengaged. The delivery device is then withdrawn from the patient, leaving the occlusion in place.<br>
While the exemplary method shown in Figures 2A-2C follows a sequence in which both balloons are inflated, occlusive material is delivered through both catheters, both balloons are deflated, and the catheters withdrawn, a procedure in which all actions are completed initially by one delivery catheter followed sequentially by completion of all actions for the second delivery catheter is equally contemplated by the present invention and can be at the discretion of the operator. Further, it should be understood that the exemplary method may comprise, as depicted in Figure 2B, the sequential dispensing of occlusive material (23) from each of two delivery catheters placed in the uterine cornua (24), or alternatively simultaneous dispensing of occlusive material (23) through both delivery catheters.<br>
The delivery system may comprise ease of use features as depicted in Figures 3A-3C, which show further exemplary embodiments of a delivery system. Figure 3A shows an external view of a delivery device with the delivery catheters extended, wherein the delivery device comprises the following components: an atraumatic tip (1) of the introducer shaft; a balloon (8), which is depicted in the drawing as being inflated; the delivery end (7) of the delivery catheter; the shaft of the introducer (3) comprising two introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft; that contain the delivery catheters and guide them into position; a delivery device stabilizer (4) to aid in correct placement throughout the procedure; an ergonomically designed handle (5); a slide grip (26) that is used by the operator to move the delivery catheters into position, wherein the grip has both up and down movement for extension or retraction and side to side, movement for rotation of the catheter tip and wherein the position of the grip can be locked in place to prevent further motion of the catheter once the desired placement has been achieved; the shaft of the dual lumen delivery catheter<br>

(27); a occlusive material ampule (28) containing a flowable occlusive composition (23); and, a delivery plunger X29).<br>
Figure 3B shows an enlargement of the delivery device, as it would appear when it is proximal to the target site for delivery, where the numbered components are as described for Figure 3A.<br>
Figure 3C shows internal aspects of the delivery device described in Figure 3A, comprising the introducer shaft (3), wherein the introducer shaft has two dual lumen delivery catheters (27) disposed within it; a distal bifurcation housing (30), wherein each dual lumen catheter is directed by the distal bifurcation housing (30) to one of two slide grips (26), allowing for individual manipulation of each catheter by the operator; each catheter shaft continues from the slide grip (26) generally towards the delivery plunger (29) wherein the two catheter shafts are each attached to the occlusive material bifurcation housing (31) having a channel which directs the flowable occlusive material (23) into each of the two delivery catheters; and a component (32) capable of piercing the occlusion material ampule (28) when the plunger (29) is depressed to initiate entry of the material into the delivery catheters. Although Figures 3A-3C do not show a mechanism for inflation and deflation of the balloon, it should be understood that the delivery system may include such a mechanism. An embodiment of such a balloon inflation mechanism is described in the present invention, although other embodiments of this mechanism could be used therein. A method of use for this embodiment of the delivery system may be. like that of the delivery system depicted in Figures 1A-1C, or claimed herein. For example, the system comprises introducing the delivery device transcervically with the delivery catheters contained within the introducer, each delivery catheter is moved into position and the balloon inflated, the material is delivered, and the system withdrawn.<br>
Depicted in Figure 4 are further exemplary embodiments of the delivery device stabilizer (4), serving a similar or additional function to that shown in Figure 1, which allows for the fixation of the delivery system to the cervix or hold the delivery device in position during use of the delivery system of the present invention. These stabilizers may be used as a component of the delivery device described herein or may be useful for holding in position any transcervical device or instrument having a shaft, including, for example, hysteroscopes and uterine cannulas.<br>
Figures 4A-4C show a method of use of one embodiment of a delivery device stabilizer which is slidable on the introducer shaft.<br>

Figure 4A depicts an example of a delivery device stabilizer (4) that fits into the cervical canal and expands to lock in place. Once the atraumatic tip (1) is in position at the uterine fundus (19), a delivery device stabilizer can be employed. As shown, the cervical canal (33) has a larger inner diameter than the introducer shaft (3), which allows movement of the shaft when inserted. The cervix (20) has a large enough opening to allow passage of the delivery device stabilizer (4) into the cervical canal in a collapsed or deflated state. As shown in Figure 4B, the delivery device stabilizer (4) is moved transcervically into the canal while the introducer shaft (3) is held in place, with the atraumatic tip (1) of the introducer shaft positioned at the top of the uterine fundus (19). The collapsed expandable portion of delivery device stabilizer (4) is positioned within the cervical canal while a wider base, of sufficient size to prohibit entry into the cervix, is positioned against the external os. Figure 4C shows the delivery device stabilizer (4) in the uterine canal, wherein the expandable portion of the delivery device stabilizer (4) is expanded or inflated. When expanded, the expansion portion of delivery device stabilizer (4) holds the delivery device stabilizer in place and prevents excessive motion of the introducer shaft (3). Although the delivery device stabilizer is shown in Figures 4B and 4C residing within the cervical canal, the design of this locking mechanism may also be envisioned to lie up to and even through the internal os with any portion of the length designed for expansion to enhance fixation.<br>
Figure 4D shows in detail an exemplary embodiment of the delivery device stabilizer (4) with an expandable portion, wherein the delivery device stabilizer mechanism may slide on the introducer shaft. The stop has a hollow core (36), which allows it to be mounted on the shaft of the introducer where it is designed to slide for proper positioning. An expandable portion (34) is mounted on a non-expandable portion (37), which is attached to a base portion (35) that is of sufficient size to prohibit passage into the cervix. The expandable portion (34) may be a balloon that is expanded with a distension medium of one or more gases or fluids, solid or semi-solid materials, to hold it in place. The expandable portion (34) may also be a mechanical device such as spiral or straight wire members that are mechanically actuated to effect expansion. The expandable portion (34) may be expanded after insertion or may be inserted in a partially or fully expanded state prior to insertion and further expanded as required after insertion into the cervix. Any means for providing an expandable portion that are known to those skilled in the art is contemplated by the present invention.<br>
Figure 4E illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a delivery device stabilizer with a pre-formed internal portion.   The delivery device stabilizer comprises a hollow core (36) for<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
attachment to and slidable movement relative to the introducer shaft. The stabilizer comprises a portion that fits into the cervix (38) and a base portion that remains outside the cervix (35), wherein the portion that fits inside the cervix is shaped such that it locks or wedges into or through the cervical canal and limits motion. The shape may be rounded, wedge-shaped, or have any other geometry that allows a snug fit within the cervical canal. The portion that fits inside the cervix (38) may be made from a different material than the outer portion (35) or may be made from a combination of materials. While rigid materials may be used, materials that are pliable, compressible, or expand in place such as by swelling, or some combination thereof may be preferred. The delivery device stabilizer mechanism may be designed and material selected such that the delivery device stabilizer mechanism collapses or is -compressed while being pushed through the cervix and then re-expands upon placement in the target location.<br>
Figure 4F shows an exemplary embodiment of a delivery device stabilizer mechanism with a hollow core (36) to fit over a shaft that has a portion (38) that fits into or through the cervical canal as well as a base portion (35) that has a cup shape that conforms to the outer geometry of the cervix. Figure 4G illustrates placement of the exemplary delivery device stabilizer mechanism of Figure 4F, showing that the base portion with a cup shape conforms to the outer curvature of the cervix while the inner portion (38) fits within the cervical canal. The shape of the inner portion (38) may be rounded, wedge-shaped, or have any other geometry that allows a snug fit. The portion that fits inside the cervix (38) may be made from a different material than the outer portion (35) or may be made from a combination of materials. While rigid materials may be used, materials that are pliable, compressible, or expand in place such as by swelling, or combinations of such characteristics may be used. Either the internal portion (38) or the base portion (35) may be used alone or in combination as necessary to ensure appropriate fixation, stability, or both. It may be considered that the exemplary embodiments described in Figure 4 incorporate the function of a depth stop, as shown in Figure 1, into the design of the delivery device stabilizer (4).<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show the placement of an exemplary embodiment of a delivery device stabilizer referred to as a cervical clamp. In one aspect of the present invention, the cervical clamp may be used in the delivery system that does not incorporate an additional delivery device stabilizer. In a further aspect of the present invention, the cervical clamp may be used in a delivery system that also uses one or more additional delivery device stabilizers, which may include a depth stop. Figures 5A and 5B show a cervical clamp (39) mounted on an introducer shaft (3), which is attached to a handle (5).  The introducer shaft (3) is positioned<br>

such that the tip of the shaft 
Figure 5C depicts an exemplary embodiment of a cervical clamp in which the grasping arms (42) may remain in a folded state until acted upon by a force. The cervical clamp, with a hollow core (36) to allow the clamp to move over a shaft, includes grasping arms (42), which are actuated to attach to the cervix. In this embodiment, three grasping arms are depicted. Other embodiments include devices with two, four, five, or more grasping arms. The grasping arms are positioned such that the tips of the arms (41) are in close proximity to the introducer shaft on which the cervical clamp is mounted. As depicted in Figure 5C, tabs (43) are provided that, when squeezed by the operator of the device, cause the arms (42) and tips (41) to move outward, causing the cervical clamp to open. The clamp (39) is positioned over the cervix (20), and the tabs (43) are released, causing the clamp to fasten or attach to the cervix. The clamp is released by pressing on the tabs (43) to move the arms (42) outward, disengaging the tips (41) from the cervix. A further embodiment of the device may include a mechanism for movement of the clamp (39) relative to the shaft (3) and a mechanism for controlling the movement arms (42), wherein such mechanisms may be incorporated into the handle (5) of the delivery device.<br>
Figure 5D depicts a further embodiment of a cervical clamp in which the grasping arms (42) may remain in an open state until acted upon by a force. In this embodiment, four grasping arms are depicted. Other embodiments include devices with two, three, five, or more grasping arms. A compression member (44), with a hollow core (36), slides relative to the shaft of the clamp (45) and imparts a compressive force on the arms (42), deforming or moving them into a closed or folded position. To attach this embodiment to the cervix (20), the compression member (44) is advanced to compress the arms (42) to a folded state as depicted in Figure 5A. When the clamp (39) is in place near the cervix (20), the compression member (44) is retracted to allow the arms to open. Subsequent advancement of the compression member {44) closes the arms (42) of the clamp (39), by deforming or moving the arms (42) to bring the tips (41) in to contact with the cervix (19).  The compression member (44) may be advanced or retracted by<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT7US2005/006334<br>
mechanical means such as threads, ratchet, slider, or other mechanisms. A furtiier embodiment of the device may include a mechanism for movement of the clamp (39) relative to the shaft (3) and a mechanism for controlling the movement of the compression member (44) incorporated into the handle (5) of the delivery system.<br>
The tips of the arms (41) of the cervical clamp (39) may further comprise one or more grasping teeth, or may include other shapes or mechanisms for firmer or more comfortable attachment to the cervix (20). The tips (41) and arms (43) may be made from the same material or of distinct materials as required; for example, the tips may incorporate a material that is compressible and conformable to the cervix and may be designed to alter shape when in contact with the cervix to provide increased comfort or improved gripping. One aspect of the invention envisions that the tips (41) interact with the cervix (20) in such a manner that the grip strength of the clamp is sufficiently low that the patient feels little or no pain with minimal or no anesthesia while having sufficient grip strength to hold, fix, and/or stabilize the position of the introducer. The cervical clamp (39) has a cylindrical channel (36), which allows for mounting onto or sliding over the introducer shaft (3).<br>
Figures 6A-6E illustrate exemplary embodiments of conduit occlusion opening or re-opening devices, or reversal devices and methods, particularly for opening or re-opening one or more occluded fallopian tubes. The example discussed herein is directed to opening occluded fallopian tubes, but this description is in no way to be seen as limiting the methods of the present invention. An introducer shaft (3) with two or more channels may be used to deliver two or more catheters (9) to the area of the fallopian tube occlusion (25). Materials or devices for opening of occlusions or reversal of occlusions may be delivered through or mounted on the delivery catheters (9). Occluded fallopian tubes may be treated simultaneously or sequentially. The delivery device allows for the opening or re-opening of two or more conduits without the need for removal and re-introduction or substantial repositioning of the device. One or more reversal methods may be used in combination to effect re-opening of the occluded conduit. It should be understood that, while depicted for use in re-opening occlusion in fallopian tubes, the methods and devices described herein may be useful for re-opening occlusions in any occluded body conduit. As used herein, the terms opening and re-opening both refer to making a non-functional conduit functional again by providing an opening through or removing an occlusion.<br>
Figure 6A depicts the introduction of an enzymatic, solvent, or other occlusion-degrading solution (46) to the site of the occlusion (25), such that the solution (46) degrades and removes the occlusion (25). An introducer shaft (3) is placed in position and delivery catheters<br>

WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
(9) are advanced through the shaft through introducer shaft catheter channels -(2) which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft such that the catheters reach the occlusion (25). End structures (8), which may include a balloon, may be engaged, such as inflated, to limit delivery of the degrading solution to the area of occlusion (25), and may prevent retrograde flow into the uterus.<br>
Figure 6B shows a method of reversing an occlusion by passing a guide wire or small catheter (47) through the occlusion (25), thereby clearing the blocked fallopian tube. An introducer shaft (3) is placed in position, and one or more delivery catheters (9) are placed through the shaft through introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft such that the catheters reach the occlusion (25) in one or both of the fallopian tubes. A guide wire (47) or a small catheter (47) is passed through the delivery catheter (9) and advanced across the occlusion (25). The occlusion is removed or cannulated, thereby reopening the fallopian tube. Material for use in the small catheter may be sufficiently stiff to allow for movement across and through the occlusive material or tissue.<br>
As depicted in Figure 6C, one or more catheters (9) with attached balloon (48) may be placed through an introducer shaft (3) through introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft such that the catheters can be advanced such that the balloon (48) is within the area of occlusion (25). Inflation of the balloon may effect clearing of the occlusion. The catheter with attached balloon may pass directly through the introducer shaft (3) to reach the occlusion (25) or may pass through a larger catheter (not depicted) that passes through the introducer shaft (3) to the area of the occlusion (25). The balloon may be further used to effect delivery of a stent or other structure that maintains the reopened channel after reversal of the occlusion.<br>
Figure 6D depicts a method of clearing fallopian tube occlusions by using a cutting or debriding mechanism. The cutting mechanism (49) may comprise or be similar to, for example, a device for atherectomy (directional coronary atherectomy), rotoblation (percutaneous transluminal rotational atherectomy), or a cutting balloon. One or more delivery catheters (9) are passed through an introducer shaft (3) through introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft such that the catheters can be advanced to the vicinity of the<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
. occluded region (25). A cutting device (49) is advanced through the delivery catheter(9) to the occluded region {25). The cutting device is used to remove the occlusion (25), thereby reopening the fallopian tube.<br>
Figure 6E depicts a method of clearing an occlusion by using an energy-producing device (50). Ultrasound, RF energy, microwave, laser, radiation, heat, or other energy sources may be used. An introducer shaft (3) is placed, and one or more delivery catheters (9) are inserted through the introducer shaft through introducer shaft catheter channels (2), which run the interior length of the shaft and have openings for insertion of a catheter into the shaft and for the catheter to exit the shaft so that the catheters can be provided to the area of the occlusion (25). An energy-producing device (50) mounted on a catheter or wire is passed through the introducing catheter (9) and into the occluded region (25). The occluded region is subjected to energy from the energy source, which removes the occlusive material and clears the occlusion.<br>
Figure 6F depicts a uterus that has been subjected to one or more of the methods depicted in figures 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, and 6E. After treatment, the occlusion has been re-opened or removed, leaving patent fallopian tubes (51).<br>
The delivery systems of the present invention comprise means for introducing delivery devices into the body, means for providing occlusive material such as reservoirs and pumps, devices for in situ delivery of compositions comprising occlusive materials, means for polymerizing or coagulating the occlusive materials, including mechanical, biological or chemical means; means for visualization of procedures, pre- and post-procedural compositions and methods of treatment, means and compositions for supporting or inducing tissue ingrowth or degradation of the occlusive material, and means for re-opening of the occluded conduit.<br>
The present invention further comprises methods for occluding fallopian tubes that are useful for providing female sterilization. It is well known in the art that a primary cause of naturally occurring infertility in females is blockage of the oviducts from the ovary to the uterus. Females having this natural condition normally do not even realize it exists and do not suffer any adverse side effects besides being infertile. Moreover, the condition can often be successfully reversed, thus restoring the ability to bear children. Based upon the observations of naturally occurring oviductal occlusion, the creation of tubal occlusions by external intervention has arisen as a potential means of effecting female sterilization;<br>
Aspects of the present invention comprise a delivery system, compositions comprising one or more occlusive materials, and a method for tubal occlusion and more particularly occlusion of the fallopian tubes of a female mammal for the purpose of reversible sterilization.<br>
19<br><br>
WO2005/0822"	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the delivery device is inserted either directly or through an introducer sheath and positioned to reach the area in which the occlusion is desired while the operator non-invasively visualizes the delivery to ensure correct placement. Once in place, the operator instills the occlusive agent through a channel in the delivery catheter, creating the occlusion. The delivery device is then withdrawn, leaving the occlusion in place. Over time, fibrous tissue grows into the material as it resorbs, leaving an occlusion fashioned of the patient's own tissue. The delivery system may be used to deliver an agent, such as a device or composition, to reverse the occlusion, and methods for re-opening the occlusion are described.<br>
As envisioned for female sterilization, a delivery system comprises a transcervical introducer sheath generally made of a standard medical-grade metal or plastic such as stainless steel, nylon, PTFE, or polyurethane, which may be naturally sonolucent or may require enhancement of ultrasound visibility by coating with a sonolucent material or otherwise modifying the material. The sheath may comprise an atraumatic tip to allow for comfortable placement and, combined with selection of a suitably flexible material, to prevent damage to the uterine wall. The introducer shaft has sufficient diameter to allow for introduction of other components of the delivery system. The introducer may contain one, two or more channels that guide catheters into position, for example delivery catheters for delivery of occlusive materials. The introducer may include a mechanism to modify the angle of the introducer relative to the surrounding tissues, such as the cervix or uterus, to allow for a better fit to the anatomy of the individual patient, including such individual variations as ante- or retroverted / ante- or retroflexed uterus. Modified versions of the introducer may allow for uses other than for the occlusion of the fallopian tube(s), such as the localized delivery of contrast media for confirmation of tubal patency or the delivery to or removal from the fallopian tube(s) of other material or devices for diagnosis, treatment, or examination of the tube, including the delivery of systems for re-opening an occlusion. One aspect of the introducer sheath is that it can be visualized using noninvasive techniques such as ultrasound. Visualization may be used to guide accurate placement and to ensure that the tip of the device does not penetrate the uterine wall. A delivery device stabilizer may be included to ensure that accurate placement is maintained throughout the procedure. The delivery device stabilizer may comprise or include a means to fix or hold the introducer in place, such as a mechanism or device to attach or hold the introducer within the cervix or to otherwise maintain the device in the desired position, minimizing risk to the patient and allowing the operator greater flexibility to carry out other aspects of the procedure.   Fixation may be accomplished through physical means such as<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
clamping, suction, wedging, inflation, or by other means that maintain the device in the desired position.<br>
A delivery system of the present invention comprises a device that can be configured in<br>
a collapsed, retracted, or folded form for insertion through the cervix, which may comprise an<br>
introducer sheath. After introduction, the device is positioned allowing an atraumatic tip<br>
containing a single or multiple holes at the tip of the device to reach the desired location, such<br>
as within the cornual aspect of the uterus at or near the ostium of a fallopian tube. The present<br>
invention comprises a device that has at least one end of a delivery catheter with an opening<br>
that is placed within the cornual aspect of the uterus at or near the ostium of a fallopian tube. In<br>
one embodiment, the delivery device comprises two delivery catheters, with each catheter<br>
having its delivery opening positioned simultaneously or sequentially at the ostia of both<br>
fallopian tubes. In another embodiment, such a device may be shaped like a Y, a T, or an arrow<br>
wherein the two delivery ends of the shape are positioned within the uterine cornua at or near<br>
the ostia. The delivery system may utilize existing catheter-based technology, for example,<br>
balloon catheters, and may incorporate standard materials such as Pebax, nylon, PTFE,<br>
polyurethane, vinyl, polyethylene, ionomer, polyamide, polyethylene terephthalate, and other<br>
materials. These materials may be naturally sonolucent or may be modified to enhance their<br>
ultrasound visibility, such as by coating or the inclusion of air bubbles within the material.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may include a means for controlled flexion or rotation of<br>
the delivery system, which may aid in positioning one or more ends at the desired anatomic<br>
location. The catheters may be designed with one or more curves that ensure that the tip is<br>
guided to the uterine cornua. Such curves may be either pre-formed to suit a majority of female<br>
reproductive anatomies or may be selected.based on the individual anatomy of a single female<br>
patient.	<br>
The present invention comprises methods for occlusion of fallopian tubes comprising delivery of devices, such that the methods incorporate intra-procedure non-invasive visualization without hysteroscopy, and positioning of the delivery ends of a delivery device within the uterine cornua at or near the ostia of both fallopian tubes without the need for removal and reintroduction of instrumentation. Embodiments of the present invention comprise delivery devices that are sized appropriately for a general population of patients and also comprise delivery devices that are custom-fitted and individually tailored to meet individual patient anatomical needs. Delivery devices taught in the prior art, such as U.S. Patents Nos. 5,746,769, 6,145,505, 6,176,240, 6,476,070, 6,538,026, 6,634,361, 6,679,266, and 6,684,384,<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
5,954,715, 6,068,626, 6,309,384, 6,346,102, and 6,526,979 do not consider individual patient anatomy, may require the use of a hysteroscope for direct visualization, and necessitate cannulation of each tube sequentially, with the need to reposition, withdraw and reinsert the device, enhancing the technical difficulty of the procedure and consequently the inherent risk of' failure.<br>
One aspect of this invention contemplates the use of pre-procedure imaging, such as by ultrasound, to allow for selection or adjustment of lengths and angles of the deployed delivery device and selection of appropriate delivery device stabilizer to accommodate individual patient anatomy. This pre-procedure imaging is used to rule out anomalies that may preclude use of the system and may be used to determine the uterine width between the fallopian tubes to select the correct size delivery system or to adjust the angle or shape of each of the two delivery ends such that each would be properly located within the uterine cornua at or near the ostium of a tube on deployment. Imaging may also elucidate the size and shape of the cervical os and canal, guiding selection of size and shape of delivery device stabilizer or spacer. Alternatively, one of a set of predetermined sizes of the delivery system could be selected based on the pre-procedure imaging information. The ability to adjust placement of the delivery ends or tips, including the angle and length for each individual end or in combination, during the procedure based on tactile feedback, imaging, or both tactile and imaging information is also contemplated. Other pre-procedure methods include the use of hormonal medications to control estrogen/progesterone cycle changes or prevent placement of the device during pregnancy and the use of pre-operative medications such as anti-infective or immune response therapies.<br>
The present invention further comprises post-procedure methods and compositions. Post-procedure methods may comprise, for example, ultrasound or X-ray visualization, to allow for confirmation that the occlusive material continues to provide an occlusion over time. Post-procedure methods and compositions may further comprise the use of hormonal agents to prohibit menstrual shedding of the endometrium is also contemplated to minimize the risk of expulsion for a period of time, for example to allow for a period of time for resorption of the occlusive material and tissue ingrowth. For example, use of a long-acting hormonal medication such as an injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate depot may serve the function of both the pre- and post-operative hormonal therapy without (the need for reliance on patient compliance. Post-operative methods and compositions may further comprise antibiotic or steroidal compositions.<br>

Methods of the present invention comprise visualization of one or more steps of the methods. Visualization of the insertion, placement of the device, and release of the occlusive composition are included in methods for providing the occlusive material. Visualization of the occluded region, removal of the occlusive material, reopening of the conduit and testing for return of functionality of the conduit are included in methods for reversing the occlusion of the conduit. Such visualization methods are known to those skilled in the art. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,731,052 and 4,824,434 teach that ultrasound may be used for visualization of internal structures. The compositions and devices of the present invention comprise materials that allow for visualization, such as by ultrasound, during the procedure to ensure appropriate patient selection and device placement and localization, and for post-application monitoring to confirm appropriate material placement and the presence of an occlusion.<br>
Once the delivery device is appropriately placed, the occlusive material is introduced through the delivery device to create the occlusion of the fallopian tubes. In one aspect of the invention, the delivery device has individual channels in the shaft of the introducer, with capability to provide a delivery end or tip directed toward the opening of a fallopian tube. An aspect of the invention allows for the simultaneous or sequential delivery of occlusive material to the fallopian tubes without the need to withdraw and reinsert or substantially reposition the device. The occlusive material is delivered by actions of the operator manually or automatically once the device is in position. One aspect of the invention contemplates the occlusive material is visualizable by non-invasive imaging such as ultrasound. Materials may be naturally sonolucent or may be modified to have enhanced sonolucency by the introduction of materials or bubbles such as microbubbles of air or gas. These microbubbles may be present within the material prior to attachment to the delivery system or may be introduced into the material during the delivery process, such as through the use of a cavitation mechanism.<br>
It is contemplated that the methods taught herein are effective with one application of occlusive material to at least one conduit, though the methods comprise at least one application - to at least one conduit. Embodiments also comprise one or more applications of occlusive material to at least one conduit during one delivery cycle. For example, once the delivery device is in place in the uterus, with at least one end of the device at the site or sites to be occluded, occlusive material may be applied once, and then, without removal, one or more other applications of occlusive material are performed. Alternatively, occlusive materials may be placed at the site or sites for occlusion over multiple treatments. For each treatment, the delivery device would be inserted and removed.   Such multiple applications may occur on<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
consecutive days of insertion and removal or the days of insertion and removal may be interspersed with days of no applications of oeclusive material. Such treatment regimens may be designed with individual patient needs taken into account by those skilled in the art, such as the treating physicians. Such treatment regimens may utilize the same or different occlusive compositions at each application.<br>
The occlusive compositions include natural or synthetic materials. Natural materials include those found in animals or plants and not necessarily in the species in which they are-used. Synthetic materials include any materials that can be made by humans or machines in laboratory or industrial settings. The compositions may comprise materials that are initially mostly fluid that polymerize in situ to become solid materials, may comprise solid materials that may or may not change properties such as flexibility, once placed at the site or sites for occlusion, may comprise a mixture of fluids with gas, solid articles or both, dispersed therein. The occlusive material compositions may be a pre-formed shaped material that is released by the device once one or more delivery ends are in position, and the compositions may comprise occlusive material that starts as a liquid or semi-solid mat cures in situ. The compositions of the present invention may include solid structures such a stents, rods, pellets, beads, and other tissue bulking agents that provide a solid structure to the occlusion formed at the site or sites. Compositions of the present invention may also combine pre-formed structures, such as spheres or particles, with material that starts as a liquid or semi-solid and cures in situ, entrapping the preformed structures.<br>
One aspect of the present invention comprises an occluding composition comprising a liquid that is mixed prior to delivery or does not require pre-mixing such as the single liquid composition, is ultrasound visible, and cures upon delivery into and through the tubal ostia within 5 cm of the ostium to provide mechanical blockage and is at least 75% resorbed at a range of between about 30 to about 365 days. In one embodiment, the occluding composition is not hydrophilic and does not swell in the presence of fluids in the environment. In another . aspect, the occlusive composition forming the occlusion may aid in the initiation or stimulation of tissue growth into the occluded site, wherein the occlusion is replaced by tissue that maintains the occlusion after resorption of the occlusion material. In another aspect, an embodiment of the invention contemplates use of an occlusive material that has a functional lifespan wherein for a period of time it forms the physical occlusion or blockage of the lumen, and after period of time, the occlusive material is gone, having been resorbed or degraded, but is not replaced by tissue ingrowth, so that the lumen is again open and functional.<br>

WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, the occlusiye material comprises a two component liquid comprising a resorbable polymer solution component and a liquid cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive component. The resorbable polymer is a polyester polymer selected from polylactide, polyglycolide or polycaprolactone, or a polyester copolymer selected from poly(lactide/glycolide) acid (PLGA) or poly(lactid-co-e-caprolactone) (PLCL). The cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive component comprises any of a number of biocompatible alkyl- or alkoxyalkyl-2-cyanoacrylates such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate or 2-methoxybutyI-2-cyanoacrylate. The two component liquids are mixed prior to entry in the catheters for delivery. In curing, the cyanoacrylate homopolymerizes and entraps the polyester polymers or copolymers. The cyanoacrylate adheres to the lumen wall to anchor the occlusion in place.<br>
A single liquid composition is also contemplated. The single liquid composition comprises a liquid tissue adhesive, such as a cyanoacrylate with a nano- or micro-particulate material, which may be made from resorbable polyesters. In one aspect of the invention, the particles are capable of visualization by ultrasound. The particles and tissue adhesive are combined prior to delivery to the target site. The composition cures by the homopolymerization of the tissue adhesive, entrapping the particles, and anchors the occlusion in the lumen by adhesion to the lumen wall.<br>
The resorbable nature of the occluding composition and the proximity of the occlusion to the ostia, extending over a limited length of the fallopian tube, may allow for ease in the reversibility of the contraceptive method. As the occlusive implanted composition is resorbed, there is ingrowth of tissue that maintains the occlusion. The tissue occlusion so formed can be recanalized to provide an open conduit for fertilization without the need for surgical removal and reapposition of the tube across the area of the occlusion.<br>
A wide variety of materials are known in the art that can be used to form the conduit occlusions of the present invention, such as oviduct occlusions. U.S. Patent No. Re 29,345 teaches the use of silastic that is partially pre-formed and partially in situ cured. U.S. Patent No. 4,185,618 teaches the use of a gel-forming carrier substance that holds in place a tissue fibrosis-promoting material.

The present invention comprises these and other occlusive compositions for blocking a conduit that may be introduced using the delivery devices of the current invention.<br>
One aspect of the occlusive compositions of the current invention comprises a resorbable material capable of providing an initial mechanical blockage and initiating or supporting the tissue ingrowth necessary to create the occlusion and/or an adhesive composition that maintains the position of the material during curing and the initial phase of tissue ingrowth. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,359,454, 6,476,070, and 6,538,026 teach the use of cyanoacrylate, and in particular a composition containing either n-methyl or n-hexyl cyanoacrylate, as a resorbable, -yet scar-promoting, material. Other patents teach compositions of polymerizable monomers, such as cyanoacrylates, alone or in combination with other materials, such compositions that may be useful as occlusive agents or adhesives in the present invention and/or as resorbable materials capable of initiating or supporting tissue ingrowth to form a, permanent adhesion. These include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,328,687,, 5,350,798, 6,010,714, 6,143,352, 6,174,919, 6,299,631, 6,306,243, 6,433,096, 6,455,064, 6,476,070, 6,538,026, 6,579,469, 6,605,667, 6,607,631,6,620,846, and 6,723,144.<br>
A further aspect of the current invention includes materials that are delivered in a solid or non-solid form which may be used to deliver or adhere materials that may be useful in promoting or forming occlusions or which may be useful in forming occlusions in and of themselves whereas such material may be resorbable or permanent. Such materials include dry compositions that hydrate and form crosslinked hydrogels, as taught by U.S. Patent 6,703,047. U. S.

The present invention contemplates use of an in situ curable material, which lowers the<br>
risk of expulsion by allowing the material to conform and adhere to the walls of the conduit, or<br>
specifically the uterus and/or fallopian tube. Compositions capable of in situ curing preferably<br>
comprise a material that is flowable at a temperature outside physiologic limits but curable at<br>
physiologic temperatures such as those taught by U.S. Patents No. 5,469,867 and 5,826,584.<br>
High viscosity liquids capable of delivering and maintaining materials in place mat are useful<br>

The present invention comprises use of compositions made from a combination of more than one material to form the occlusion, particularly compositions that comprise materials that cure or polymerize by differing mechanisms. For example, the compositions may comprise a combination of two materials, one of which cures or polymerizes because an activating agent is present and the other cures, polymerizes or solidifies, all of which are interchangeable terms, because of the pH of the environment in which it is placed. Components of the mixture may<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
serve different or overlapping roles; for example, a tissue adhesive component may primarily serve to minimize expulsion of the implant while tissue in-growth is occurring, while another component may primarily initiate or support the tissue growth. The tissue adhesive component may be selected from the group of materials containing the cyanoacrylates, polyacrylic acids, polyethylene glycols, modified polyethylene glycols, thrombin, collagen, collagen-based adhesives, fibrin, fibrin glue compositions, gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde-glutaraldehye (GRFG) glue, autologous blood in combination with collagen and/or thrombin, crosslinked albumin adhesives, modified glycosaminoglycans, poly(N-isopropylacryIamide)-based adhesives, alginates, chitosan, and gelatin, crosslinked with carbodiimide or genepin, among others, in a proportion of the overall composition from about 5% to 50%, from about 5% to 25%, from about 10% to 50%, or from about 10% to 25%. The material added primarily for the initiation or support of tissue ingrowth may be chosen from the group consisting of solid or solvated resorbable polymers, including the resorbable polyesters or their copolymers. The tissue ingrowth component, including or excluding the presence of solvent, may comprise from about 20% to 80%, from about 50% to 80%, from about 40 to 70%, or from about 50% to 90% of the overall composition. When a copolymer is used the percentage of each polymer within the copolymer will be from about 25% to 75%.<br>
Additional components may be included to stabilize the overall mixture or to control the viscosity, curing time, resorption timeframe, plasticity, or to enhance visualization of the material. Such agents may include: polymerization inhibitors and stabilizers including, for example sulfonic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, sulfur dioxide, lactone, boron trifluoride, hydroquinone, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, catechol, pyrogallol, benzoquinone, 2-hydroxybenzoquinone, p-methoxy phenol, t-butyl catechol, organic acid, butylated hydroxyl anisole, butylated hydroxyl toluene, t-butyl hydroquinone, alkyl sulfate, alkyl sulfite, 3-sulfolene, alkylsulfone, alkyl sulfoxide, mercaptan, and alkyl sulfide; emulsifying agents such as polyvinyl alcohol; echogenic agents such as microbubbles of air or gas, microparticles or spheres of crosslinked albumin with entrapped air or gas (Albunex), sonicated albumin, gelatin-encapsulated air or gas bubbles, nanoparticles, microparticles, spheres, or microcapsules of resorbable polyesters or other resorbable materials with entrapped air or gas, particles of other materials with entrapped air or gas; contrast agents such as gold particles; viscosity-modifying materials such as crosslinked cyanoacrylate, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, lactic-glycolic acid copolymers, polycaprolactone, lactic acid-caprolactone copolymers, poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyalkyl acrylates, copolymers of alkylacrylate and vinyl acetate,<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
polyalkyl methacrylates, and copolymers of alkyl methacrylates and butadiene; and plasticizers such as dioctyl phthalate, dimethyl sebacate, trethyl phosphate, tri(2-ethylhexy)phosphate, tri(p-cresyl)phosphate, glyceryl triacetate, glyceryl tributyrate, diethyl sebacate, dioctyl adipate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, lauric acid, dibutyl phthalate, trioctyl trimellitate, and dioctyl glutarate. The composition may further contain colorants such as dyes and pigments. The total amount of these agents may comprise from about 0.1% to 10%, from 1% to 10%, or from 5% to 20% of the overall composition.<br>
The combination of two or more materials that cure by different mechanisms, including contact with tissue or the appropriate curing environment for example, conditions such as aqueous, ionic, temperature, or pH, chemical crosslinking, or solvent dissipation, among others, is contemplated by the current invention. The combination of one or more materials that cure by one or more mechanisms combined with one or materials that are pre-cured or pre-formed into particles, spheres, or other structures, is also contemplated by the current invention.<br>
The present invention contemplates the use of pre-formed solid materials such as<br>
particles, spheres, capsules, or the like, in combination with a liquid or semi-solid material. The<br>
pre-formed solids may comprise degradable or resorbable materials and may have enhanced<br>
ultrasound visibility or may serve to enhance ultrasound visibility of the composite occlusive<br>
material. The particles as contemplated may be nanoparticles of an average size ranging from<br>
about 100 to 2000 nanometers, about 100 to 1000 nanometers, about 250 to 2000 nanometers,<br>
or about 500 to 2000 nanometers in diameter. Particles may also be microparticles with an<br>
average size ranging from about 0.1 to 1000 micrometers, about 0.1 to 250 micrometers, about<br>
1 to 500 micrometers, about 50-500 micrometers, about 100-750 micrometers, or about 250 to<br>
1000 micrometers. The liquid or semisolid material acts as a transport medium for the pre-<br>
formed solids and then cures in situ, entrapping the solids. The particles may be coated with or<br>
contained within a material that enhances their miscibility with the liquid or semi-solid material<br>
or minimizes the tendency of the particles to promote the premature curing of the liquid or<br>
semi-solid material prior to delivery. Coating materials may include extremely low moisture<br>
content formulations of the particulate constituent materials or other polymers or copolymers<br>
containing, for example, caprolactone, poly-P-hydroxybutyrate, delta-valerolactone, as well as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyamides, gelatin, albumin, proteins, collagen, poly(orthoesters),<br>
poly(anhydrides),	poly(a-cyanoacrylates),	poly(dihydropyrans),	poly(acetals),<br>
poly(phosphazenes), poly(urethanes), poly(dioxinones), cellulose, and starches. The following patents and U.S. patent applications teach manufacturing methods for creating echogenic<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
particles for use in ultrasound contrast agents: 5,352,436; 5,562,099; 5,487,390; 5,955,143; 2004/0161384; 2004/0258761; and 2004/0258769. Particles made by these methods are contemplated by the present invention.<br>
The present invention also comprises methods for sequential applications of the same or different materials. For example, a composition of the occluding material that functions as the in situ curable material may be placed in the site or sites, and an adhesive composition may be applied separately either before or after the curable material so as to fix the implanted material in place, thus lowering the risk of expulsion. The in situ curable materials may cure or solidify in the native environment of the fallopian tube, or the curing may require the presence of an energy source, such as light, heat, other electromagnetic waves, sound waves, or microwaves or the presence of an initiator and/or accelerator for curing. The additional energy sources may be provided by the delivery device or another introductory vehicle or by sources outside the body.<br>
The end structure of a delivery device may have alternative shapes that aid in maintaining the end at the site, aid in delivery of occlusive material, aid in removal of the delivery device from the site, aid in localizing the occlusion and other shapes and designs for functions by the end. For example, a delivery device used for occluding the fallopian tubes in a mammal, having an end that is placed within the uterine comua at or near the tubal ostia, may have end structures that comprise a shape that aids in delivery of the occlusive material, for example by maintaining it in position. This end structure may function to guide tip placement of the delivery system or anchor the arm ending to and/or cover the ostium of the tube and may take the form of a nozzle, cup, or balloon. A nozzle, cup or balloon is useful for preventing leakage of compositions of in situ curable material away from the implantation site. Preferably, the end structures do not adhere to the implantable material although the use of an absorbable, detachable end structure that may adhere to the implantable material and be left in place after removal of the remainder of the delivery system is also contemplated. Using a device having a structure that conforms to the shape of the uterine cornua, maintaining localized delivery to at least one ostia eliminates the need to cannulate into the fallopian tube."<br>
The present invention comprises methods for female sterilization wherein the delivery device is not inserted into the fallopian tube and in which the occlusive material is introduced within the uterine cornua at or near the tubal ostia affecting portions of the endometrium and/or tubal epithelium. The extent of the occlusion such as the portion of the uterine cornua and fallopian tube blocked by the occlusive material, may be controlled by modification of the curing time, viscosity, and amount of material delivered.   The current invention comprises<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
methods for effective blockagevof a conduit, such as a fallopian tube, by occluding a minimal portion of the fallopian tube. Such occlusion may block a conduit for less than 1.0 mm of the length of the conduit, for less than 1 cm of the length of the conduit, for less than 3 cm of the length of the conduit, or for less than 5 cm of the length of the conduit. For example, in occluding a fallopian tube, an embodiment of the present invention comprises methods of application of an occluding material such that no more than 5 cm of the fallopian tube is occluded. In affecting this length of tube, the anatomical areas of the fallopian tube targeted for occlusion include the areas within the uterine wall (the interstitial segment) and early portions of the isthmic section. The present invention may not be dependent on the length, width or depth of the solidified occluding material, and the extent of the solidified occluding material may be dependent on whether subsequent reversal of the occlusion is desired. If reversal of the occlusion is contemplated at the time of occluding, a minimal amount of occlusion may be achieved, thus allowing for more ease in reversing the occlusion and opening the conduit.<br>
In one method of delivery of the occlusive material, pressure generated in the lumen of the delivery system forces the occlusive material through the delivery device, including at least one opening in at least one delivery end, out of the device and into the area to be blocked. Once the occlusive material has been delivered, the delivery device is removed in whole or in part from the patient (the end structure may be detachable and fashioned from a resorbable material designed to be left in place). For example, once the occlusive material is delivered to the site or the occlusive material cures in situ, the delivery device can be collapsed, re-folded, re-sheathed, or directly removed in one or more pieces from the patient.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise occlusive materials and may further comprise one or more agents that are capable of providing other functions, including but not limited to, a curable carrier for the occlusive material, allowing for controlled release of a substance, enhancing the ability of the occlusive material to cause fibrosis or inhibit contraception. Quinacrine is well established to create scarring of the tubal epithelium and cause tubal blockage. In combination with the occlusive material, low dosages of quinacrine of other sclerotic agents, such as tetracycline, may assist in creation of the fibrous tissue blockage. The compositions of the present invention comprise fibrous tissue growth promoting agents such as growth factors or pro-inflammatory reagents that are known to those skilled in the art. U.S. Patent No. 3,803,308 teaches that the instillation of copper or zinc salts alone into the uterus inhibits contraception. Current copper intrauterine devices have incorporated this concept.    The present invention comprises compositions comprising copper salts or other<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
metallic elements in addition to the occlusive material. Inclusion of hormonal contraceptives within the occlusive material to limit further the risk of pregnancy during the timeframe of tissue ingrowth is contemplated.<br>
The present invention comprises methods for using energy-delivering devices to initiate or completely form an occlusion. Such methods comprise activities at the site of the placement of the occlusive materials to aid in the formation of tissue growth and/or biodegradation of the occlusive material. Such activities include, but are not limited to, use of cautery methods, bipolar coagulating current, a high frequency generator to produce a tissue damaging current, and use of laser, light, microwave, and radiofrequency energy. Devices for providing such activities and uses thereof are taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,700,701; 5,095,917; 5,474,089; 5,954,715; and 6,485,486.<br>
The present invention also comprises delivery systems, methods and devices for removing at least one occlusion at the occluded site. As used herein, the term reversing the occluded site, means making the conduit capable of transporting again. Making the conduit capable of transporting can include, but is not limited to, removal of the original occluding material, creating a new lumen through the occluded site, such as forming a channel through the occluding material or the in-grown tissue at (the occluded site, or by-passing the occluded site. The methods of the present invention comprise delivery of devices that place permanent plugs within one or more conduits, simultaneously or sequentially, wherein such plugs are structured such that a device of the present invention can be used to remove the plugs at a later time. Structures for such plugs are taught U.S. Patent No. Re 29,345. Such plugs are not resorbable or biodegradable by bodily actions and thus incorporate means for anchoring the plugs within the conduit. The occlusion may be removed from the conduit by destruction of the occluding material. For example, Shockwaves can be used to shatter the material, similar to that used in lithotripsy methods, and the material is expelled from the conduit. Chemical or biological means, such as instillation of solvents or enzymes, can be used to disintegrate the occlusion. Removal devices of the present invention can: be used to affect one or both fallopian tubes that have occluding material therein, by physical removal of plugs, provision of materials that recanalize the occluding site, or that mechanically form a new channel through or around the occluded site. The device may also deliver a stent or other device to ensure that the new channel remains open. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,983,177; 5,989,580; 4,664,112 and others teach methods for reversibility of occluded sites. In methods for reversing the blockage of fallopian tubes, the present invention contemplates systems, methods and devices that are capable of<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
reversing the occlusion in each fallopian tube under non-invasive visualization and without removal and reinsertion or the need to reposition substantially the delivery device until both tubes are unblocked. Although it may be desirable to open the tubes one at a time, the ability to reach both tubes under non-invasive visualization and without the withdrawal and reintroduction of instrumentation represents an advantage over the prior art.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention in which a partially or fully resorbable material is used to cause occlusion of a conduit, minimal or no permanent foreign body remains in position. In fallopian tube occlusion, the occlusion is located at or near the ostium of the tube, making non-surgical access simple. A catheter with a working head for the removal of an occlusion in a vessel or other body passageway can be used with the delivery device. A method for reversal of such blocked tubes incorporates the use of a catheter-based delivery system similar to that used for the introduction of the occlusive material. In this aspect of the invention, the channel or channels of the delivery device are used for the introduction of a stiff or cutting catheter or a catheter for instillation of a dissolution medium (e.g., enzyme or solvent) that recanalizes the blocked section(s) of the tube. A stent or other device to maintain the opening may be placed through the delivery device as well.<br>

EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
Preparation of Implantable Material A<br>
A solution of 25/75 poly lactide-co-e-caprolactone (PLCL) was prepared 50% by weight in p-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) and sterilized. A mixture of 2-methoxypropyl cyanoacrylate (MPCA) with a biocompatible acid, in this case glacial acetic acid (AA), was prepared containing approximately 1 part MPCA and 1 part AA and sterilized. Implantable material A was prepared immediately prior to use by mixing 0.8 cc PLCL solution with 0.2 cc MPCA mixture until homogeneity of the mixture was achieved. The resultant mixture initially warms indicative of curing but remains adhesive to tissue and flowable through a 20G IV catheter for at least 15 min at room temperature in the absence of an aqueous environment. In contact with either water or animal tissue, the implantable material completes its curing quickly, forming a semi-solid material that is compressible and flakes relatively easily.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Implantable Material B<br>
A solution of 50/50 poly lactide-co-glyeolide (PLGA) was prepared 25% by weight in ethyl alcohol (EtOH) and sterilized. A -mixture of butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) with AA was prepared containing approximately 2 parts BCA and 1 part AA and sterilized. Implantable material B was prepared immediately prior to use by mixing 0.4 cc PLGA solution with 0.4 cc BCA mixture until -homogeneity of the mixture was achieved. The resultant mixture initially warms indicative of curing but remains strongly adhesive to tissue and flowable through a 20G IV catheter for at least 15 min at room temperature in the absence of an aqueous environment. In contact with either water or animal tissue, the implantable material completes its curing quickly, forming a relatively incompressible semi-solid material that fractures on attempted bending.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Implantable Material C<br>
Particles of 50/50 PLGA were prepared by dissolving PLGA in methylene chloride to create<br>
a 25% weight/volume solution, emulsifying in, a 0.3% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution,<br>
37<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
and further addition of PVA solution with 2% isopropyl alcohol to remove solvent. Particles were collected, lyophilized, and sterilized. Particles (0.25g) were added to 0.75g of a sterilized mixture containing 2 parts BCA and one part AA- The resulting particulate suspension was flowable at room temperature but cured on contact with water or animal tissue, forming a stiff, adherent material.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of Implantable Material D<br>
Particles of 50/50 PLGA were prepared as described in Example 3 with the addition of<br>
hydroquinone  (0.5%)  to  the  PVA emulsification,  resulting  in   the  entrapment  of<br>
hydroquinone on the surface of the particles. The panicles were collected, lyophilized, and<br>
sterilized.   Particles 
suspension remained flowable at room temperature with no indication of cyanoacrylate<br>
polymerization. The composition hardened on exposure to water or tissue, forming a stiff,<br>
adherent material.<br>
Example 5<br>
Study of 3 implantable materials in the rabbit fallopian tube<br>
Three candidate materials prepared similarly to the previous examples have been studied for their ability to create a mechanical occlusion and generate a tissue ingrowth response when placed into the fallopian tubes of rabbits. A fourth material, methyl cyanoacrylate (MCA), previously used to effect female sterilization in animals and humans but shown to have an unacceptable biocompatibility profile, was used as a control. Each of the test and control materials was placed into the fallopian tubes of three New Zealand white rabbits through an open procedure in which a 20GIV catheter was used as the delivery system. Materials were infused through the catheter into the cornual aspect of the right and left uterine body; finger pressure was used to prohibit backward flow of the material into the remainder of the uterus. Forward flow of the material was stopped once materials were seen within the cul-de-sac (i.e., peritoneal spill had occurred) or the full volume of material had been delivered. It was noted that, in comparison to the control material which cured very rapidly, sticking to the catheter, and with a high heat of curing, the test materials had a longer curing timeframe (within the time prior to closure but sufficiently long to remove the catheter without adhesion) and did not generate as much heat   Once both right and left tubes had been<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2005/082299	PCT/US2005/006334<br>
-treated, the reproductive organs were repositioned within the pelvis, and the incision was closed. At 14 days, the animals were sacrificed. Dye infusion testing demonstrated that the fallopian tubes of all animals were blocked. One test material had generated an excessive amount of inflammation and adhesions and was ruled out The remaining test materials and the control generated an appropriate tissue response, completely blocking the lumen of the fallopian tube with inflammatory cells and debris.<br>
Example 6<br>
Use of the delivery system in explanted human uteri<br>
A prototype delivery system comparable to that shown in Figure 1 was used to delivery dye and occlusive material to the fallopian tubes of three explanted human uteri obtained in accordance with the rules of the institution's Institutional Review Board. In each case, the explanted uterus was placed on an examination table in anatomic position, and the shaft of the introducer was placed transcervically until the tip reached the top of the uterine fundus as determined by tactile feel. Each of two balloon catheters was then advanced through the channel in the introducer until it was felt to lodge within the cornual aspect of the uterus. The balloons were inflated until resistance was felt. The uterus was then bivalved to allow for visualization of the device, which, in each case, was seen to be appropriately placed. One case represented a normal, multiparous uterus, while two cases demonstrated significant leiomyomatous pathology, indicating that the presence of fibroids outside the midline or the cornuadoes not interfere with the successful use of the delivery system. After successful placement was confirmed, a series of liquid injections through the catheters was conducted: first with saline to confirm patency, second with a hematoxylin dye to demonstrate that backflow into the uterine cavity did not occur, and finally with an occlusive material from the animal study in the previous example to demonstrate full functionality of the system in humans. In each case tested, dye demonstrated forward flow without leakage into, the uterine cavity, and the material was successfully delivered.<br>
