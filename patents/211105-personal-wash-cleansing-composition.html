COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10 ; rule 13)<br>
1.   TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
PERSONAL WASH CLEANSING COMPOSITION<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra. India, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
27-02-2004<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to liquid personal wash compositions comprising-a sunscreen component and minimal required levels of a cationic polymer.  The compositions provide high deposition of sunscreen component; good SPF ("sun protection factor") values as defined in applicants" SPF tests; and good consumer acceptable levels of lather.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is extremely difficult to provide liquid personal wash compositions with sunscreen components or agents with which sunscreen components may be readily deposited on the skin or another surface.  One significant problem is that the sunscreen agents are generally solubilized by the surfactant and, while they may be deposited daring lathering, they will be removed by rinsing.<br>
The art teaches the use of certain cationic polymers tc enhance deposition of sunscreen materials onto the hair and to provide protection from the harmful effects of sunlight. U.S. Patent No. 5,186,928 to Birtwistle, for example, teaches use of a cationic derivative of polygalactomannan gum for such a purpose.  However, sunscreen is never present at such a high level, such that it will not solubilize in surfactant solution (column 2, lines 54-57).  By contrast, in the present invention sunscreens are used in<br>
2<br><br>
concentrations above their solubility limit in the surfactant system used, at least in part to ensure minimum levels of deposition.<br>
EP-A-552024 to Unilever is also concerned with enhancing deposition of cosmetic agents, including sunscreens.  That document describes the addition of an additional oil phase in order to reduce solubilization of the oil/sunscreen into the surfactant phase thereby allowing more sunscreen to be available for deposition upon rinsing. The subject invention, by contrast, does not rely on an oil carrier to enhance deposition (the oil is said to reduce solubility of components in the surfactant phase and thus . â–  enhance deposition).  Farther, the present invention requires use of relatively high levels of cation-ic polymer to both enhance deposition of sunscreen (sunscreens being used at much higher levels than-those used in U.S. Patent No. 5,186,928 noted above) and increase SPF "("sun protection factor") .<br>
EP-A-313,303 (assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble) discloses compositions comprising tocopherol sorbate (antioxidant) which may be"used in combination.with sunscreen agents.  The compositions must also comprise anti-inflammatory agent and topical carrier.  There is no disclosure in this reference of the use of a cationic polymer to enhance sunscreen deposition, particularly in formulations containing high amounts of sunscreen.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,701,321 and 4,933,174 to Bernstein teach the use of a liquid detergent with a sunscreen agent.<br>
3<br><br>
The compositions contain only nonionic and amphoteric surfactants, unlike the cleansing compositions of the Invention, which must contain at least 5% anionic surfactant.<br>
WO 99/13854 (assigned to Colgate) discloses a skin cleansing, sun protecting composition comprising (a) a sun protection hydrophobic agent; {h)   a polar organic solvent which is less polar than water; (c) oil; and (d) a cleansing sffective amount of a surfactant or a mixture thereof wherein the oil/polar solvent ratio is from 1:4 to 1:0.8. In contrast, to the aqueous systems of the subject invention, this is a non-aqueous system (see the bottom of page 11),<br>
Other references teach compositions which may contain a<br>
surfactant:, a N-poiymer and a benefit agent (e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,348,576 to Verdiccio et al.; EP 117,135).<br>
These references do nor focus on sunscreens. Nor do   they<br>
teach or suggest that sunscreens must be used in amounts<br>
Deyond their solubility limit in the surfactant systems in<br>
which they are used; and that, when a sunscreen is used in.<br>
such large amounts, a cationic polymer (at relatively large<br>
levels) enhances both deposition and SPF values.<br>
	&gt;	,<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unexpectedly, the applicants have now discovered that :he minimum required levels of cationic polymer can be used :o deposit a sunscreen even in compositions comprising the sunscreen at levels beyond their solubility limit in the<br><br><br>
surfactant system-in which the sunscreen is found.  This combination of high levels of sunscreen and cationic polymer (as noted it was never previously recognised that cationic polymers could be used to provide an enhanced effect even when such large amounts of sunscreen are used) leads not only to deposition, of much greater amounts of sunscreen (at<br>
2<br>
least 10 ug/cm ), but to enhanced SPF (at least 2) .<br>
Further, the compositions have a lather of greater than 70 ml (using a funnel test) and are good cleansing compositions.  In some embodiments, crystallization control agents suppress crystallization of sunscreen component (s) and may help enhance deposition even further.<br>
More specifically, compositions of the invention are opaque (less than 50% transmittance at a visible wavelength) personal wash cleansing compositions comprising:<br>
(a)	from 5% to 70% by wt. of a surfactant or surfactants selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic and cationic surfactants wherein at least one surfactant is an anionic surfactant representing at least 3% by wt., preferably at least 5%, more preferably at least 7% by wt. of the total composition;<br>
(b)	from 0.5 to 5% by wt. of a cationic polymer;<br>
(c)	from 1% to 35% by wt. of a sunscreen or mixture of sunscreens;<br>
wherein the concentration of the sunscreen component (c) is above the solubility limit of the sunscreen component<br>
5<br><br>
in  the  surfactant  system in  which  said  sunscreen  component is  used;<br>
wherein  the  composition  has  SPF  factor  of   at   least  2, preferably  2.5,   more preferably  3.0;<br>
wherein  deposition  of  the  sunscreen  is  at   least   10<br>

Surfactants<br>
The  surfactants   of  the   invention  may  be   chosen   from  the group consisting  of  anionic,   nonionic, amphoteric/zwitterionic,    caticnic   surfactants   and  mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Examples   of   anionic   surfactants   are   soap   and   anionic non-soap  surfactants   that   can  be   exemplified  by   the  alkali metal  salts   of  organic   sulfates   having  in   their  molecular structure  an  aikyl   radical   containing   from  about   8   to  about 22  carbon  atoms   and  a  sulfonic  acid  or   sulfuric   acid  ester radical   (included   in  the   term  aIkyl   is   the   aikyl   portion  of higher acyl  radicals) .      Preferred  anionic  surfactants  are the  sodium,   ammonium,   potassium or  triethanolamine  aikyl sulfates,   especially those   obtained  by  sulfating  the  higher<br>
alcohols   (Cg-Cie   carbon   atoms),   sodium  coconut   oil   fatty  acid<br>
mcnogiyceride sulfates and sulfonates; sodium or potassium salts of sulfuric acid esters of the reaction product of 1 mole  of  a  higher   fatty  alcohol   (e.g.,    tallow   or   coconut   oil<br>
7<br><br>
alcohols) and 1 to 12 moles of ethylene oxide; sodium or potassium salts of alkyl phenol ethylene oxide ether sulfate with 1 to 10 units of ethylene oxiae per molecule and in which the alkyl radicals contain from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonates; the reaction product of fatty acids having from 10 to 22 carbon atoms esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide; water soluble salts of condensation products of fatty acids with sarcosine; and others known in the art for example, sulfosuccinates, sarcosinates, taurates, phosphate and those listed in the McCutcheon"s Encyclopedia of Surfactants.<br>
The anionic surfactant must represent at least.3% by weight of the compositions of the invention,, preferably at least 5% more preferably at least 7% by wt,<br>
Additionally, nonionic surfactants can alto -be present. in the compositions, alone or together with an anionic surfactant or another surfactant, to provide a cleansing and mildness effect.  Typical examples of such nonionic surfactants can be broadly defined as compounds produced by the condensation of aikylene oxide groups (hydrophilic in nature) with an organic hydrophobic compound, which may be aliphatic or alkyl aromatic in nature.  Examples of preferred classes of nonionic surfactants are:<br>
1.   The polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, e.g., the condensation products of alkyl phenols having an alkyl group containing from about 6 to 12 carbon atoms in either a straight chain or branched chain configuration, with ethylene oxide, the said ethylene oxide<br>
8<br><br>
being present in amounts equal to 10 to 60 moles of ethylene oxide per mole- of alkyl phenol.  The alkyl substituent in such compounds may be derived from polymerized propylene, diisobutylene, octane, or nonane, for example.<br>
2.	Those derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the product resulting from the reaction of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine products which may be varied in composition depending upon the balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic elements which is desired.  For example, compounds containing from about 4 0% to about 80% polyoxyethylene by weight and having a molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 11,000 resulting from the reaction, of ethylene oxide groups with a hydrophobic base constituted of the reaction product of ethylene diamine and excess propylene oxide, said base having a..molecular weight of from 2,500 to 3,000, are satisfactory.<br>
3.	The condensation product of aliphatic alcohols having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, in either straight chain or branched chain configuration with ethylene oxide, e.g., a coconut alcohol ethylene oxide condensate having from 10 to 30 moles Qf ethylene oxide per mole of coconut alcohol, the coconut alcohol fraction having from 10 to 14 carbon atoms. Other ethylene oxide condensation products are ethoxylated fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols (e.g., Tween 20-polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate).<br>

Additional cationic surfactants are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,303,543, see column 4, lines 58 and column 5, lines 1-42,. incorporated herein by references.  Also see CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, 4th Edition 1991, pages 509:-514 for various long chain alkyl cationic surfactants; incorporated herein by references.<br>
Cationic Polymer<br>
  second critical component of the compositions of the present invention a cationic polymer.  It is the use of a cationic polymer, particularly when the amount of sunscreen is in excess of solubility limit of the sunscreen in the surfactant system carrying it, which is believed to lead to enhanced deposition of sunscreen as well as enhanced SPF.<br>
Various cationic polymers may be used.  Examples of cationic..polymers include the cationic cellulose ethers described in U.S. Patent Nos.3,816, 616 and 4,272,515 and which are available commercially from Union Carbide Corp.1 under the trademark POLYMER JR.  Other suitable materials<br>
15<br><br>
are the cationic polygalactomannan gum derivatives described in U.S. Patent No. 4,298,494 which are commercially available under the trademark JAGUAR from Celanese-Stein Hall.  An example of a suitable material is the hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium derivative of guar gum of the formula:<br>
G-O-CH2CH-CH2 N+ (CH)3 Cl~<br>
I OH<br>
where G represents guar gum.  Such a material is available under the name JAGUAR C-13-S.  This material also has the CTFA designation Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonnium Chloride.  In JAGUAR C-13-S the degree of substitution of the cationic groups is about 0.13.  Another possible material is that known as JAGUAR C-17 which is similar to JAGUAR C-13-S but has a higher degree of substitution of cationic groups of about 0.25-0.31.  A further example of a guar derivative is the hydroxypropylaâ„¢ed cationic guar derivative known as JAGUAR C-16 which as well as containing the above cationic quaternary ammonium groups also contains<br>
hydroxypropyl (-CK2CH (OH) CH3) substituent groups.  In JAGUAR C-16 the degree,, of substitution of the cationic groups is 0.11-0.16 and the number of moles of substitution of hydroxypropyl groups is 0.8-1.1.<br>

  solubility limit of the sunscreen component in the<br>
 surfactant system in which the sunscreen(s) is used.  For<br><br>
 example, if a sunscreen has  a solubility limit of 3% in a  surfactant mixture, there must be more than 3% of such   sunscreen in the composition.<br>
The sunscreen should further be used in an amount sufficient to provide SPF at least 2, preferably at least 2.5, more preferably at least 3.0.<br>
SPF is a commonly used measure of photo protection of a sunscreen against erythema.  This number is derived from another parameter, the minimal erythemal dose (MED) .  M.ED is  defined as the "least exposure dose at aspecified wavelength that will elicit a delayed erythema"response." The MED indicates the amount of energy irradiating the skin and, the responsiveness of the skin to the radiation.  1"ne;-SPF of particular photo protector is obtained by divid"ing the MED of protected skin by the MED of unprotected skin. The higher the SPF, the more effective the agent in preventing sunburn.  The SPF value indicates how many times longer a person can stay in the sun person to experience 1 MED. For example, utilizing a sunscreen with a SPF of 6 will allow an individual to stay in the sun six times longer before receiving 1 MED.  As the SPF value of a sunscreen increases, the less chance exists for development of tanning of the skin.  Typically, commercially available sunscreening products have SPF values ranging from about 2 to 45.<br>
The value of at least 2 is determined using method described in protocol of the application.<br>
20<br><br>
Together the amount of sunscreen and amount of cationic<br>
polymer must be sufficient such that there is deposition of<br>
2 at least 10 [ig/cm .<br>
The compositions of the invention must also be able to provide a. foam height of at least 70 ml, preferably 80-1000 ml, more preferably at least 110 ml, more preferably greater than 200 ml and more preferably more than 250 ml using the funnel test described in the protocol.<br>
Finally, the compositions of the invention are opaque as defined above.<br>
It should be understood that variables may vary depending on exact compositions.  Thus, compositions with more cationic polymers (e.g., 1% or more) vrill tend to have higher deposition or those with a specific polymer may deposit better than others.  Also, the higher level of sunscreen, the greater"the tendency that more of it will be above the solubility of surfactant system in which it is used and thus the degree of deposit will be better.  All these factors should be taken into account when designing optimal compositions.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be shampoos, shower gels, handwashes, face and body washes or other similar types, of compositions.  Generally, they will comprise at least 30% parts weight, preferably 35-90% water. The viscosity of the compositions typically ranges from " 10,000 to 300,000 using a T-bar Spindle A at 0.5 rpm (about<br>
21<br><br>
25Â°C)   or   from 500  to  30,000   cps   using  Brookfield  Spindle   5  at 20  rpm   (about  25Â°C).<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following protocols were used in making deposition and SPF measurements discussed in the Examples.<br>
SPF Test Method<br>
The protocol used to test the prototypes for Sun Protection Factor (SPF) on humans is described below:<br>
26<br><br><br>
Panelists are selected by good clinical practice inclusion criteria among which are: 18 years of age or older, with fair skin of types I, II or III, free of any dermatological or systemic disorder which would interfere with the results, have been screened according to a preliminary medical history, have no known abnormal response to sunlight, have signed an informed consent.  The skin types are defined as follows:<br>
I:   always burns easily; never tans<br>
II:  always burns easily; tans minimally<br>
III; burns moderately; tans gradually<br>
Exclusion criteria include, under a doctor"s care, taking medication that may interfere with the results, with chronic skin allergies, with suntan or sunburn, pregnant cr lactating females.<br>
Light Source:<br>
The light source employed is a 150 watt Xenon Arc Solar Simulator having a continuous emission spectrum in the UV-E range from 290 to 320 nm.  A xenon arc is selected on the basis of its black body radiation temperature of 6000Â°K which produces continuous UV spectra (all wavelengths) substantially equivalent to that of natural sunlight.<br>
This device is equipped with a dichroic mirror (which reflects all radiation below 400   nm) and works in conjunction with a 1mm thick Schott WG-320 filter (which<br>
27<br><br>
absorbs all radiation below 290 nm) to produce simulation of the solar UVA-UVB spectrum.  A 1 mm thick UG 5 or UG 11 filter (black lens) was added to remove reflected (infra-  " red, greater than 700 nm) heat and remaining visible radiation.<br>
UVB radiation was monitored continuously during exposure using a Model DCS-1 Sunburn UV Meter/Dose Controller System (Solar Light Co..) formerly known as the Robertson - Berger Sunburn meter (R-B meter) .  Measurements were taken at a position within 8 mm from the surface of the skin.  The field of irradiation was 1 cm in diameter.<br>
Procedure:<br>
One test site area served to determine each subject"s Minimal Erythema Dose (MED).  This.was executed by exposing the back to a series of timed incremental UV exposures at 25% intervals.  The individual subject"s MED is the shortest time of exposure tnat produces minimally perceptible erythema at 20 to 24 hours post irradiation.  The test area is described as the infra capsular area of the back to the right and left of the midline.<br>
In an uninvolved area, two sites were marked for unprotected control and homosalate.control product and control product was applied.  The homosalate standard was delivered to the test site through a plastic volumetric syringe.  The material was then evenly applied to a rectangular area measuring 5 cm x 10 cm (50 cm2) for a final<br>
concentration of 2.0 mg/cm .  Fifteen (15.0) minutes after<br>
application, a series of UV light exposures in 25%<br>
28<br><br>
increments, calculated from previously determined MED"s, bracketing the intended SPF was administered from the solar simulator to sub sites within the treated area.  On the actual day of testing another series of exposures similar to the one given on the previous day was administered to an adjacent untreated, unprotected area of the skin to reÂ¬determine the MED.<br>
An adjacent test site was then selected to perform an<br>
2<br>
SPF determination of the test substance.  A 5 x 10 cm<br>
target area was marked on the back and centred within an 8 x<br>
2<br>
16 cm oval.  The oval was 100 cm and defined as the lather<br>
area.  The test panelist stood in the tub area and the back was not immersed, however,, it was maintained in a vertical position.  A hand held sprayer with a water temperature cf from 25 to 30Â°C  and a flow rate of -13 ml/sec was. raod.  A sprayer was held at a- 4 5Â° angle to the back and a distance cf 6 inches from the back and aimed at a site 8 inches above the centre of the target area.  The spray was maintained for 15 seconds allowing water to run down over the lather area.<br>
0.1 ml of product was applied using a plastic volumetric syringe across the wet.target area.  The site was lathered by a technician with the index and middle finger in a circular motion over the entire target area, making sure to have uniform lathering over the entire site.  Lathering was conducted for 15 seconds without spray.  While the technician continued to rub/lather, a rinsing spray was reintroduced for 10 seconds in the manner described above. Lathering was ceased and the site was sprayed for another 5<br>
29<br><br>
seconds.  A terrycloth towel was folded so as to cover the entire lather area.  The site was gently patted dry 4 times in a blotting motion.<br>
The above described procedure was- repeated for the test material on the opposite side of the back.  Sites were allowed to re-equilibrate for 30 minutes after rinse procedure.  The sites were irradiated as described above.<br>
Evaluation of Responses:<br>
The panelists were instructed to return to the testing facility 2C to 24 hours after exposure for evaluation of delayed erytftemic response.  The smallest exposure or the least amount of energy required to produce erythema (HED) in the treated site was recorded.  The SFF was then calculated, according to the following equation:<br>
SPF = MED Protected Skin<br>
MED unprotected Skin<br>
All expert graders are required to take and pass a visual discrimination examination conducted by a Board Certified Ophthalmologist using the Farnsworth - Munsell 100 Hue Test as published which determines a person"s ability to discern color against a black background.   This test was additionally modified to include a flesh tone background more nearly approaching actual use conditions, wherein erythematous skin is graded according to intensity.<br>
Panelist"s results were rejected if:<br>
30<br><br>
1.	The responses on the treated site were randomly absent or out of sequence.  This was an indication that the products were not spread uniformly.<br>
2.	A MED could not be obtained due to elicited response at all exposure sites.<br>
3.	The exposure series failed to elicit a MED response on either the untreated or the applied skin areas.  The test was then considered a technical failure and the subject"s data discarded.<br>
In-vitro Deposition MetJiod<br>
The method used to quantify the in-vitro deposition of sunscreen from prototypes is described below.  Assays are done"in triplicate to obtain an average of the deposition measurement for each prototype.<br>
Skin Preparation<br>
Juvenile female porcine skin, (3-4 weeks old) was purchased and prepared for use by shaving and pre-washing. Hair was shaved with a Norelco electric razor, Model 715RL. The. skin was pre-washed with 5 ml of 5% NaLES surfactant solution and rinsed well with water.  Three replicate pre-wash treatments were performed to remove triglycerides and alkanes present on the skin as natural components.  The" skin was then cut into approximately 3" x 3" to obtain 18-21<br>
31<br><br>
pieces of skin.  The pre-washed shaved porcine skins were placed randomly in aluminium foil and stored in the freezer with an assigned batch number.<br>
Treatment with Prototype<br>
A piece of pre-washed porcine skin sample was thawed, rinsed once with warm tap water with a controlled flow rate of -130 mL - 140 ml/10 seconds to wet the surface of the skin.  Excess water was allowed to drip from the skin.  The<br>
pre-washed skin was treated with a cleanser prototype using<br>
2 0.5 g/58 cm skin area.  The product was lathered/rubbed<br>
onto the skin in a circular motion to ensure even coverage for 15 seconds which is about 20 times of rubbings.  The    ; skin was then rinsed with tap warm water using the above flow rate for 15 seconds.  The skin was patted once with paper towel to dryland placed in hood to allow further crying for 5 minutes.<br>
Extraction and Quantification of UV Absorber<br>
Extraction of the skin benefit agents on the cleansed porcine skin was performed using 10 mL of heptane, 5.0 cm diameter hollow glass cylinder and a disposal pipetter.  Two extractions were carried out on each porcine skin sample.  A glass cylinder was placed onto the skin and held tightly to create a good seal on the porcine skin.  The disposal plastic pipette was used to provide some mixing of the heptane during extraction.  Each extraction was performed using about 5 mL o heptane for 2 minutes and 4 0 seconds.  The heptane extracts were combined and collected into a vial.  The weight of the<br>
32<br><br>
heptane  extract  was  recorded.     Quantification   relies  on  UV spectrophotometry comparing  absorbance  spectrum of  the  extract against  that   for  calibration standards.<br>
Lather Volume<br>
Lather  volume was measured using  a pouf method.     Lather was  generated by dispensing  1  gram of product  onto  a  wet (drained)   pouf,   which was  then  squeezed uniformly  30  times with  one hand.     The pouf was gently immersed into water (90Â°F)   and  the  generated  lather was  collected  in  a  graduated tube  through  a  funnel with a big mouth.     Its  volume was calculated by  the  difference of  the  readings  between  the  top ari"d" the bottom.   The measurement  was  repeated  7   times^ f or each  sample.<br>
Preparation	â€ž<br>
Typically,   Examples  of  the  invention were  made  as follows:<br>
The  required amount  of water  was  added to  the mixing tank and heated to  75Â°C.     Anionic  surfactants   were  added   (one at  a  time   if  a mixture)   and stirred until  completely dissolved.     Amphoteric  surfactants  were  added  and  stirred until  completely dissolved.   A sunscreen pre-mix  was  charged and mixed until  thoroughly dispersed.   A glycerin/cationic polymer  pre-mix  was  charged and mixed thoroughly.      Cooling was  begun  and  optional  ingredients   (e.g.,   opacifier, preservative,   perfume,   etc.)   were  added.<br>
33<br><br>
The  two  pre-mixes  were prepared:<br>
(i)      Pre-mix  of  cationic polymer  in  glycerin;<br>
(ii)   UV  absorbers  were  thoroughly mixed  assuming<br>
complete  dissolution;   heat  was  used  if   necessary.<br>
A crystallization  control  agent  was   also  used,   if<br>
required.<br>
The following Examples were made which show the use of various sunscreen levels and combinations./<br>

The.. .Examples above show that, where level of sunscreen (18.5%) is above its solubility limit in a given system (see Table 1 where solubility of 7.5% MCX /6.0% BP3/5.0% OS in this system is 2-2.3%), deposition is greatly enhanced.  By contrast, the solubility limit of MCX in the 10% betaine /5% SLS system with ll perfume is -3% (In a system with MCX, PP3 and OS, solubility was about 3%; therefore in a system with MCX alone, solubility would also be expected to be about 3%) .  Thus, when only 3% MCX is used, this is solubilized by surfactant and deposition is very low (7).<br>

From Examples 6, 7 and 8 and the two Comparatives, it can be seen that polymer .levels must be at a minimum (preferably 0.3% and above, iriore preferably at least 0.5%, more preferably at least 0.8%) to achieve the best deposition results.  Jaguar is a preferred polymer although it is not the only one which can be used.  Preferably, deposition should be at least 10, more preferably at least 14,   more preferably at least 20 and more preferably 50 and above.<br>

As clearly seen from Table 11. above,. when sunscreen is used above the solubility limit in the surfactant system in combination with a cationic polymer, the sun protection delivered was remarkably enhanced.<br>
Results were measured by a simple wash under normal use conditions. Panelists were instructed to come to lab within an hour of use to determine MED.<br>
43<br><br>
MED was measured on the outer upper arm and the outer upper thigh before and after product use on a panel size of 20 individuals.  SPF was calculated from the ratio of MED treated to MED untreated.<br><br>
