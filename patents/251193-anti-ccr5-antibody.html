Background of the Invention<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l) induces viral-to-cell membrane fusion to gain entry into target cells (8, 15, 66). The first high-affinity interaction between the virion and the cell surface is the binding of the viral surface glycoprotein gpl20 to the CD4 antigen (13, 30, 41, 42) . This in turn induces conformational changes in gpl20, which enable it to interact with one of several chemokine receptors (4, 5, 21, 36) . The CC-chemokine receptor CCR5 is the major co-receptor for macrophage-tropic (R5) strains, and plays a crucial role in the sexual transmission of HIV-1 (4, 5, 21, 36). T cell line-tropic (X4) viruses use CXCR4 to enter target cells, and usually, but not always, emerge late in disease progression or as a consequence of virus propagation in tissue culture (4, 5, 21, 36). Some primary HIV-l isolates are dual-tropic (R5X4) since they can use both co-receptors, though not always with the same efficiency (ll, 57). Mutagenesis studies coupled with the resolution of the gpl20 core crystal structure demonstrated that the co-receptor-<br>
binding  site  on  gpl20  comprises  several  conserved residues (32, 53, 65} .<br>
It has been demonstrated that tyrosines and negatively charged residues in the amino-terminal domain (Nt) of CCR5 are essential for gpl20 binding to the co-receptor, and for HIV-1 fusion and entry (6, 18, 20, 22, 28, 31, 52, 54). Residues in the extracellular loops (ECL) 1-3 of CCR5 were dispensable for co-receptor function, yet the CCR5 inter-domain configuration had to be maintained for optimal viral fusion and entry (24). This led to the conclusion either that gpl20 forms interactions with a diffuse surface on the ECLs, or that the Nt is maintained in a functional conformation by bonds with residues in the ECLs. Studies with chimeric co-receptors and anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies have also shown the importance of the extracellular loops for viral entry (5, 54, 64).<br>
Molecules that specifically bind to CCR5 and CXCR4 and block interactions with their ligands are a powerful tool to further probe the structure/function relationships of the co-receptors. Characterizing such compounds could also assist in designing effective therapeutic agents that target co-receptor-mediated steps of viral entry. Inhibitors of CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor function identified to date are diverse in nature and include small molecules, peptides, chemokines and their derivatives, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) . The mechanisms of action of the small molecules that block entry by interfering with CXCR4 co-receptor function are not well understood (17, 49, 55, 68). One such inhibitor, the anionic small molecule AMD3100, depends on residues in ECL2 and the fourth trans-membrane (TM) domain of CXCR4 to inhibit viral entry, but it is not clear whether it does so by disrupting gpl20 binding to CXCR4 or post-binding steps<br>
leading to membrane fusion (16, 34, 55) . To date, no small molecules have been reported that specifically block CCR5-mediated HIV-l entry. Inhibition of HlV-l entry by chemokines is mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms: blockage of the gpl20/co-receptor interaction and internalization of the chemokine/receptor complex (3, 26, 59, 63). The variant AOP-RANTES also inhibits recycling of CCR5 to the cell surface (40, 56). Variants such as RANTES 9-68 and Met-RANTES only prevent the gpl20/CCR5 interaction and do not down-regulate CCR5 (67) . SDF-1 variants presumably act through a similar mechanism to block viral entry mediated by CXCR4 (12, 27, 39). Only one anti-CXCR4 mAb, 12G5, has been characterized for its anti-viral properties. The efficiency of 12G5 inhibition of viral entry has been reported to be both cell- and isolate-dependent (43, 58). This mAb binds to the ECL2 of CXCR4, but the mechanism by which it inhibits entry is unknown (7). Few of the anti-CCR5 mAbs characterized to date efficiently prevent HIV-l entry (28, 64). Interestingly, mAbs whose epitopes lie in the Nt domain of CCR5, which contains the gpl20-binding site, inhibit viral fusion and entry less efficiently than mAb 2D7, whose epitope lies in ECL2. 2D7 also antagonizes CC-chemokine activity (64).<br>
A panel of six murine mAbs, designated PA8, PA9, PA10, PAll, PA12 and PA14 have been isolated and characterized. All six mAbs specifically bound to CCR5* cells but with different efficiencies that were cell type-dependent. Epitope mapping studies identified the residues that are important for mAb binding and also revealed information about the folding and interactions of the CCR5 extracellular domains. All mAbs inhibited HIV-l fusion and entry, but there was no correlation between the ability of a mAb to inhibit fusion and entry and its ability to inhibit binding of gpl20/sCD4 to CCR5* cells.<br>

Brief Description of the Figures:<br>
Figure l:<br>
Binding of anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to CCR5*<br>
cells: Flow cytometry was used to detect CCR5 protein expression on the surface of L1.2-CCR5* cells and freshly isolated, PHA/IL-2-stimulated PBMC. Cells were incubated with saturating concentrations of each mAb, which were detected with a PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG reporter antibody. Results from a representative experiment are shown. Results for each mAb are expressed both in mean fluorescence intensities (m.f.i.) and in % gated cells. Since PA8-PA12 and PA14 are all of the IgGl subclass, their m.f.i. are directly comparable. 2D7 is an lgG2a.<br>
Figure 2:<br>
CI values for different combinations of mAbs and viral inhibitors:<br>
Experiments like those described in the legend of Fig. 7 were performed for different combinations of viral entry inhibitors. Anti-CCR5 mAbs were tested in combination with each other, CC-chemokines, and CD4-IgG2, which inhibits HIV-l attachment to target cells. The PAll and PA12 concentration range was 0-250 µg/ml; the 2D7 and PA14 concentration range was 0-25 µg/ml; the RANTES concentration range was 0-250 µg/ml; the CD4-lgG2 concentration range was 0-25 µg/ml. The concentrations of single-agents or their mixtures required to produce 50% and 90% inhibition of fusion or entry were quantitatively compared in a term known as the Combination Index (CI).<br>
Figure 3:<br>
IC50, values for inhibition of cell-cell fusion, viral entry and gpl20/sCD4 binding by anti-CCR5 mAbs :<br>
For comparative purposes we have summarized the IC50 values obtained in the different assays that the anti-CCR5 mAbs were tested in. lc50 values were only calculated for mAbs that could inhibit &gt;90% of fusion, entry or binding.<br>
Figure 4:<br>
Epitope mapping of anti-CCR5 mAbs:<br>
A two color staining protocol was used to assess binding of mAbs to mutant CCR5 proteins, tagged at the C-terminus with the HA peptide. HeLa cells expressing CCR5 point mutants were incubated with saturating concentrations of each mAb followed by detection with a PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG. Cell surface co-receptor expression was measured by double-staining of the cells with a FITC labeled anti-HA mAb. The four grids correspond to the four extracellular domains of CCR5. The first row of every grid indicates the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CCR5 extracellular domain (SEQ ID NOS: 1-4). Binding of anti-CCR5 mAbs to the alanine mutant of each residue is expressed as a percentage of binding to wild-type CCR5, as described in Materials and Methods.<br>
Figure   5:<br>
Inhibition of calcium mobilization into CCR5" cells by  anti-CCR5  mAbs-.<br>
L1.2-CCR5* cells were loaded with Indo-lAM and stimulated sequentially with an anti-CCR5 mAb or PBS, followed with RANTES (a) . Fluorescence changes were measured with a spectrofluorometer and     the      tracings      are      from     a      representative<br>
experiment. Calcium flux inhibition by PA14 and 2D7 was tested for a wide range of mAb concentrations (b). Results are plotted as % inhibition of calcium influx = [1- (relative fluorescence in the presence of mAb + relative fluorescence in the absence of mAb)] x 100%, and are means of values from three independent experiments.<br>
Figure 6:<br>
Inhibition of CCR5 co-receptor function by anti-CCR5 mAbs:<br>
Inhibition of cell-cell fusion by anti-CCR5 mAbs was tested in the RET assay (a) . 0-250jig/ml of PA8-PA12, or 0-25^/ml of PA14 or 2D7, were added to a mix of HeLa-EnvJR.FL" and PM1 cells, labeled with F18 and R18 respectively. Fluorescence RET was measured after 4h of incubation. Results are mean values from three independent experiments and are expressed as % inhibition of fusion = [l-(%<br>
RET in the presence of mAb + % RET in the absence of mAb)] x 100%. Inhibition of HIV-1 entry by anti-CCR5 mAbs was tested in a single round of replication luciferase based entry assay (b) . U87-CD4*CCR5* cells were infected with NLluc'env" reporter virus carrying the JR-FL envelope in the presence of 0-250^g/ml of PA8-PA12, or 0-25^g/ml PA14 or 2D7. Luciferase activity (relative light units, r.l.u.) was measured in cell lysates 72h post-infection. Results are from a representative experiment and are expressed as % inhibition of entry = [1-(r.l.u. in the presence of mAb -5- r.l.u. in the absence of mAb)] x 100%. Binding of biotinylated [b] gpl20, sCD4 and b-gpl20-CD4 complexes to L1.2-CCR54 cells (c) . Strong binding is observed when gpl20 derived from the R5 virus<br>
HIV-lJR.FL is complexed with an equimolar amount of sCD4 . No binding is observed in the absence of sCD4 or for gpl20 derived from the X4 virus HIV-l ^j. Background binding to CCR5- LI.2 cells has been subtracted from all curves. Inhibition of gpl20/sCD4 binding to L1.2-CCR54 cells was tested in the presence of varying concentrations of each antibody (d). Cells were pre-incubated in 96-well plates with an anti-CCR5 mAb followed by an incubation with a saturating concentration of biotinylated gpl20/sCD4. Finally, binding of PE-labeled streptavidin to cells was measured using a fluorescence plate reader. Results are from a representative experiment and are expressed as % inhibition of gpl20/sCD4 binding = [l-(m.f.i. in the presence of mAb - m.f.i. in the absence of mAb)] x 100%.<br>
Figure 7:<br>
Synergistic inhibition of cell-cell fusion by PA12 and 2D7:<br>
Dose-response curves were obtained for the mAbs used individually and in combination. 0-50|ig/ml of PA12, 0-25µg/ml 2D7, or a combination of the two in a 2:1 ratio, were added to a mix of HeLa-EnvJR.FL* and PM1 cells, labeled with R18 and F18 respectively. Fluorescence RET was measured after 4 hours of incubation. Results are expressed as % inhibition of fusion and are the means of values from three independent experiments. Data were analyzed using the median effect principle, which can be written<br>
f   =   l/[l + ,(K/c)m]	-   (l)<br>
where f is the fraction affected/inhibited, c is concentration, K is the concentration of agent required to produce t-he median effect, and m is an<br>
empirical coefficient describing the shape of the dose-response curve. Equation (1) is a generalized form of the equations describing Michaelis-Menton enzyme kinetics, Langmuir adsorption isotherms, and Henderson-Hasselbalch ionization equilibria, for which m = 1. In the present case, K is equal to the IC50 value. K and m were determined by curve-fitting the dose-response curves and Equation (1) was rearranged to allow calculation of c for a given f. The best-fit parameters for K<br>
and c are 8. 8|ig/ml and 0.54 for PA12, 0.36^/ml and 0.68 for 2D7, and 0.11|ig/ml and 1.1 for their combination. These curves are plotted and indicate a reasonable goodness-of-fit between experiment and theory.<br>

This invention provides humanized forms of the above antibodies.<br>
As used herein, 'humanized" describes antibodies wherein some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR regions are replaced with corresponding amino acids derived from human immunoglobulin molecules. In one embodiment of the humanized forms of the antibodies, some, most or all of the amino acids outside the CDR regions have been replaced with amino acids from human immunoglobulin molecules but where some, most or all amino acids within one or more CDR regions are unchanged. Small additions, deletions, insertions, substitutions or modifications of amino acids are permissible as long as they would not abrogate the ability of the antibody to bind a given antigen. Suitable human immunoglobulin molecules would include IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA and IgM molecules. A "humanized" antibody would retain a similar antigenic specificity as the original antibody, i.e., in the present invention, the ability to bind CCR5.<br>
One skilled in the art would know how to make the humanized antibodies of the subject invention. Various publications, several of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this application, also describe how to make humanized antibodies. For example, the methods described in United States Patent No. 4,816,567 (71) comprise the production of- chimeric antibodies having a<br>
variable region of one antibody and a constant region of another antibody.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,225,539 (72) describes another approach for the production of a humanized antibody. This patent describes the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce a humanized antibody wherein the CDRs of a variable region of one immunoglobulin are replaced with the CDRs from an immunoglobulin with a different specificity such that the humanized antibody would recognize the desired target but would not be recognized in a significant way by the human subject's immune system. Specifically, site directed mutagenesis is used to graft the CDRs onto the framework.<br>
Other approaches for humanizing an antibody are described in United States Patent Nos. 5,585,089 (73) and 5,693,761 (74) and WO 90/07861 which describe methods for producing humanized immunoglobulins. These have one or more CDRs and possible additional amino acids from a donor immunoglobulin and a framework region from an accepting human immunoglobulin. These patents describe a method to increase the affinity of an antibody for the desired antigen. Some amino acids in the framework are chosen to be the same as the amino acids at those positions in the donor rather than in the acceptor. Specifically, these patents describe the preparation of a humanized antibody that binds to a receptor by combining the CDRs of a mouse monoclonal antibody with human immunoglobulin framework and constant regions. Human framework regions can be chosen to maximize homology with the mouse sequence. A computer model can be used to identify amino acids in the framework region which are likely to interact with the CDRs or the specific antigen and then mouse amino acids can be used at these positions to create the humani zed ant ibody.<br>
The above patents 5,585,089 and 5,693,761, and WO 90/07861 (75) also propose four possible criteria which may used in designing the humanized antibodies. The first proposal was that for an acceptor, use a framework from a particular human immunoglobulin that is unusually homologous to the donor immunoglobulin to be humanized, or use a consensus framework from many human antibodies. The second proposal was that if an amino acid in the framework of the human immunoglobulin is unusual and the donor amino acid at that position is typical for human sequences, then the donor amino acid rather than the acceptor may be selected. The third proposal was that in the positions immediately adjacent to the 3 CDRs in the humanized immunoglobulin chain, the donor amino acid rather than the acceptor amino acid may be selected. The fourth proposal was to use the donor amino acid reside at the framework positions at which the amino acid is predicted to have a side chain atom within 3A of the CDRs in a three dimensional model of the antibody and is predicted to be capable of interacting with the CDRs. The above methods are merely illustrative of some of the methods that one skilled in the art could employ to make humanized antibodies. The affinity and/or specificity of the binding of the humanized antibody may be increased using methods of directed evolution as described in Wu et al . (1999) J. Mol . Biol. 284:151 and U.S. Patents Nos. 6,165,793; 6,365,408 and 6,413,774.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the humanized form of the antibody comprises a light chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6. In another embodiment, the antibody comprises a heavy chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. In a further embodiment, the antibody may comprise the heavy chain variable amino acid sequence<br>
as set forth in SEQ ID NO:12.<br>
In another embodiment, the humanized antibody comprises the light chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6, and the heavy chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. Alternatively, the antibody may comprise the light chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6 and the heavy chain variable amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:12.<br>
The variable regions of the humanized antibody may be linked to at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region of a human immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, the humanized antibody contains both light chain and heavy chain constant regions. The heavy chain constant region usually includes CHI, hinge, CH2, CH3 and sometimes, CH4 region. In one embodiment, the constant regions of the humanized antibody are of the human IgG4 isotype.<br>
This invention provides isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding these anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies or their humanized versions. The nucleic acid molecule can be RNA, DNA or cDNA. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the light chain. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the heavy chain. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid encodes both the heavy and light chains. In one embodiment, one or more nucleic acid molecules encode the Fab portion. In one embodiment, one or more nucleic acid molecules encode CDR portions. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the variable domain. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the variable domain and one or more constant domains.<br>
Preferably, analogs of exemplified humanized anti-CCR5 antibodies differ from exemplified humanized anti-CCR5 antibodies by conservative amino acid substitutions. For purposes of classifying amino acid substitutions as conservative or non-conservative, amino acids may be grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic side chains) : met, ala, val, leu, ile,- Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr; Group III (acidic side chains) -. asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains) : asn, gin, his, lys, arg; Group v (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another.<br>
Analogs of humanized anti-CCR5 antibodies show substantial amino acid sequence identity with humanized PRO 140 #1 or humanized PRO 140 #2, exemplified herein. Heavy and light chain variable regions of analogs are encoded by nucleic acid sequences that hybridize with the nucleic acids encoding the heavy or light chain variable regions of humanized PRO 140 #1, or humanized PRO 140 #2, or degenerate forms thereof, under stringent conditions.<br>
Due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences encode the humanized anti-CCR5 antibody of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the antibody is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule that is highly homologous to the foregoing nucleic acid molecules. Preferably the homologous nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 90% identical to the nucleotide sequence provided herein. More preferably, the nucleotide sequence is at least about 95% identical, at<br>
least about 97% identical, at least about 98% identical, or at least about 99% identical to the nucleotide sequence provided herein. The homology can be calculated using various, publicly available software tools well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary tools include the BLAST system available from the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health.<br>
One method of identifying highly homologous nucleotide sequences is via nucleic acid hybridization. Thus the invention also includes humanized CCR5 antibodies having the CCR5-binding properties and other functional properties described herein, which are encoded by nucleic acid molecules that hybridize under high stringency conditions to the foregoing nucleic acid molecules. Identification of related sequences can also be achieved using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other amplification techniques suitable for cloning related nucleic acid sequences. Preferably, PCR primers are selected to amplify portions of a nucleic acid sequence of interest, such as a CDR.<br>
The term "high stringency conditions" as used herein refers to parameters with which the art is familiar. Nucleic acid hybridization parameters may be found in references that compile such methods, e.g., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook, et al. , eds., Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, 1989, or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F.M. Ausubel, et al., eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York. One example of high stringency conditions is hybridization at 65 degrees Centigrade in hybridization buffer (3.5X SSC, 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02% Bovine Serum Albumin,  2. 5mM NaH2P04  (pII7),  0.5%  SDS,  2mM<br>
7-EDTA). SSC is 0.15M sodium chloride/0.015M sodium citrate, pH7; SDS is sodium dodecyl sulphate; and EDTA is ethylenediaminetetracetic acid. After hybridization, a membrane upon which the nucleic acid is transferred is washed, for example, in 2X SSC at room temperature and then at 0.1-0.5X SSC/0.1X SDS at temperatures up to 6 8 degrees Centigrade.<br>
The nucleic acid sequences are expressed in hosts after the sequences have been operably linked to (i.e., positioned to ensure the functioning of) an expression control sequence. These expression vectors are typically replicable in the host organisms, either as episomes or as an integral part of the host chromosomal DNA. Commonly, expression vectors will contain selection markers, e.g., tetracycline or neomycin, to permit detection of those cells transformed with the desired DNA sequences (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,704,362 which is incorporated herein by reference).<br>
E. coli is one prokaryotic host useful particularly for cloning the DNA sequences of the present invention. Other microbial hosts suitable for use include bacilli, such as Bacillus subtilus, and other enterobacteriaccae, such as Salmonella, Serratia, and various Pseudomonas species. In these prokaryotic hosts, one can also make expression vectors, which will typically contain expression control sequences compatible with the host cell (e.g., an origin of replication) . In addition, any number of a variety of well-known promoters will be present, such as the lactose promoter system, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, a beta.-lactamase promoter system, or a promoter system from phage lambda. The promoters will typically control expression, optionally with an operator sequence, and have ribosome binding site sequences and the like, for initiating ' and completing transcription<br>
and translation.<br>
Other microbes, such as yeast, may also be useful for expression. Saccharomyces is a preferred host, with suitable vectors having expression control sequences, such as promoters, including 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes and an origin of replication, termination sequences and the like as desired.<br>
In addition to microorganisms, mammalian tissue cell culture may also be used to express and produce the polypeptides of the present invention (see, Winnacker, 'From Genes to Clones,", VCH Publishers, New York, New York (1987)). Eukaryotic cells are actually preferred, because a number of suitable host cell lines capable of secreting intact immunoglobulins have been developed in the art, and include the CHO cell lines, various COS cell lines, HeLa cells, preferably myeloma cell lines, etc. and transformed B cells or hybridomas. Expression vectors for these cells can include expression control sequences,  such  as  an  origin  of  replication,  a promoter, an enhancer (Queen, et al. , Immunol. Rev., 89,  49-68  (1986)  which  is  incorporated herein  by reference), and necessary processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites,  RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites and transcriptional terminator sequences. Preferred expression control sequences are promoters  derived  from  immunoglobulin  genes,  SV4 0, Adenovirus,  cytomegalovirus,  Bovine  Papilloma Virus, and the like.<br>
The' vectors containing the DNA segments of interest (e.g., the heavy and light chain encoding sequences and expression control sequences) can be transferred into the host cell by well-known methods, which vary depending on the type of cellular host. For example,<br>
-calcium chloride transfection is commonly utilized for prokaryotic cells, whereas calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation may be used for other cellular hosts (see generally, Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1982) which is incorporated herein by reference) .<br>
Once expressed, the whole antibodies, their dimers,<br>
individual light and heavy chains, or other<br>
immunoglobulin forms of the present invention, can be<br>
purified according to standard procedures of the art,<br>
including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity<br>
columns, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and<br>
the like (see generally, R. Scopes, "Protein<br>
Purification",	Springer-<br>
Verlag, New York (1982)). Substantially pure immunoglobulins of at least about 90 to 95% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity most preferred, for pharmaceutical uses. Once purified, partially or to homogeneity as desired, the polypeptides may then be used therapeutically (including extracorporeally) or in developing and performing assay procedures, immunofluorescent stainings and the like (see generally, Immunological Methods, Vols. I and II, Lefkovits and Pernis, eds. , Academic Press, New York, New York (1979 and 1981)) .<br>
For diagnostic or detection purposes, the antibodies may either be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled antibodies can be used in combination with other labeled antibodies (second antibodies) that are reactive with the humanized antibody, such as antibodies specific for human immunoglobulin constant regions. Alternatively, the antibodies can be directly labeled. A wide variety of labels can be employed, such as radionuclides, fluors, en2ymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme   cofactors,    enfcyme   inhibitors,    ligands<br>
-(particularly haptens), etc. Numerous types of immunoassays are available and are well known to those skilled in the art for detection of CCR5-expressing cells or detection of CCR5 modulation on cells capable of expressing CCR5.<br>
The present invention also provides antibody	fragment-<br>
polymer conjugates having an effective	size or<br>
molecular weight that confers an increase	in serum<br>
half-life, an increase in mean residence	time in<br>
circulation (MRT) and/or a decrease in serum	clearance<br>
rate over underivatized antibody fragments.<br>
The antibody fragment-polymer conjugates of the invention can be made by derivatizing the desired antibody fragment with an inert polymer. It will be appreciated that any inert polymer which provides the conjugate with the desired apparent size or which has the selected actual molecular weight is suitable for use in constructing the antibody fragment-polymer conjugates of the invention.<br>
Many inert polymers are suitable for use in pharmaceuticals. See, e.g., Davis et al . , Biomedical Polymers: Polymeric Materials and Pharmaceuticals for Biomedical Use, pp. 441-451 (1980). In all embodiments of the invention, a non-protinaceous polymer is used. The nonprotinaceous polymer ordinarily is a hydrophilic synthetic polymer, i.e., a polymer not otherwise found in nature. However, polymers which exist in nature and are produced by recombinant or in vitro methods are also useful, as are polymers which are isolated from native sources. Hydrophilic polyvinyl polymers fall within the scope of this invention, e.g., polyvinylalcohol and polyvinvypyrrolidone. Particularly useful are polyalkylene ethers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG); polyoxyalklyenes such as polyoxyethylene,<br>
polyoxypropylene    and    block    copolymers    of polyoxyethylene   and   polyoxypropylene   (Pluronics) ,• polymethacrylates;  carbomers;  branched or unbranched polysaccharides which comprise the saccharide monomers D-mannose,  D- and L-galactose,  fucose,  fructose,  D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-glucuronic acid, sialic acid, D-galacturonic   acid,    D-mannuronic    acid    (e.g., polymannuronic acid, or alginic acid), D-glucosamine, D-galactosamine,   D-glucose   and   neuraminic   acid including homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides such  as  lactose,  amylopectin,  starch,  hydroxyethyl starch,  amylose,  dextran sulfate,  dextran,  dextrins, glycogen,  or  the  polysaccharide  subunit  of  acid mucopolysaccharides, e.g., hyaluronic acid, polymers of sugar alcohols such as polysorbitol and polymannitol, heparin or heparon. The polymer prior to cross-linking need not be, but preferably is, water soluble but the final conjugate must be water soluble. Preferably, the conjugate exhibits a water solubility of at least about 0.01 mg/ml and more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/ml,  and still more preferably at least about  l mg/ml. In addition the polymer should not be highly immunogenic  in  the  conjugate  form,  nor should  it possess   viscosity   that   is   incompatible   with intraveneous infusion or injection if the conjugate is intended to be administered by such routes.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer contains only a single group which is reactive. This helps to avoid cross-linking of protein molecules. However it is within the scope of the invention to maximize reaction conditions to reduce cross-linking, or to purify the reaction products through gel filtration or ion-exchange chromatography to recover substantially homogeneous derivatives. In other embodiments the polymer contains two or more reactive groups for the purpose of linking multiple antibody fragments to the polymer backbone.<br>
Again, gel filtration or ion-exchange chromatography can be used to recover the desired derivative in substantially homogeneous form.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymer can range up to about 500,000 D and preferably is at least about 20,000 D, or at least about 30,000 D, or at least about 40,000 D. The molecular weight chosen can depend upon the effective size of the conjugate to be achieved, the nature (e.g., structure such as linear or branched) of the polymer and the degree of derivitization, i.e., the number of polymer molecules per antibody fragment," and the polymer attachment site or sites on the antibody fragment.<br>
The polymer can be covalently linked to the antibody fragment through a multifunctional crosslinking agent which, reacts with the polymer and one or more amino acid residues of the antibody fragment to be linked. However, it is also within the scope of the invention to directly crosslink the polymer by reacting a derivatized polymer with the antibody fragment, or vice versa.<br>
The covalent crosslinking site on the antibody fragment includes the N-terminal amino group and epsilon amino groups found on lysine residues, as well other amino, imino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl or other hydrophilic groups. The polymer may be covalently bonded directly to the antibody fragment without the use of a multifunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) crosslinking agent, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,458,355.<br>
The degree of substitution with such a polymer will vary depending upon the number of reactive sites on the antibody fragment, the molecular weight, hydrophilicity<br>
and other characteristics of the polymer, and the particular antibody fragment derivitization sites chosen. In general, the conjugate contains from 1 to about 10 polymer molecules, but greater numbers of polymer molecules attached to the antibody fragments of the invention are also contemplated. The desired amount of derivitization is easily achieved by using an experimental matrix in which the time, temperature and other reaction conditions are varied to change the degree of substitution, after which the level of polymer substitution of the conjugates is determined by size exclusion chromatography or other means known in the art.<br>

Such commercially available PEG derivatives include, but are not limited to, amino-PEG, PEG amino acid esters, PEG-hydrazide, PEG-thiol, PEG-succinate, carboxymethylated PEG,   PEG-propionic  acid,   PEG  amino  acids,   PEG succinimidyl succinate,  PEG succinimidyl  propionate, succinimidyl   ester   of   carboxymethylated   PEG, succinimidyl carbonate of PEG, succinimidyl esters of amino   acid   PEGs,   PEG-oxycarbonylimidazole,   PEG-nitrophenyl  carbonate,  PEG  tresylate,  PEG-glycidyl ether,  PEG-aldehyde,  PEG-vinylsulfone,  PEG-maleimide, PEG-orthopyridyl-disulfide, heterofunctional PEGS, PEG vinyl derivatives, PEG silanes and PEG phospholides. The  reaction  conditions  for  coupling  these  PEG derivatives will vary depending on the protein, the desired degree of PEGylation and the PEG derivative utilized. Some factors involved in the choice of PEG derivatives include: the desired point of attachment (such  as  lysine  or  cysteine  R-groups),  hydrolytic stability and reactivity of the derivatives, stability, toxicity and antigenicity' of the linkage, suitability<br>
for analysis, etc. Specific instructions for the use of any particular derivative are available from the manufacturer. The conjugates of this invention are separated from the unreacted starting materials by gel filtration or ion exchange HPLC.<br>

This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details which follow. However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. Experimental Details:<br>
Example 1<br>
A. Materials and Methods<br>
1)	Reagents<br>
MAb 2D7 was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and CC-  and CXC-chemokines were obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) .  CD4-IgG2  (1), soluble  (s) CD4 (2) and recombinant HIV-1JR.FL gpl20, were produced by Progenies Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (59)-<br>
2)	Isolation and purification of anti-CCR5 mAbs<br>
L1.2-CCR5* cells  (63) were incubated for I6h in the<br>
presence  of  5mM  sodium  butyrate,  which  activates<br>
-transcription from the cytomegalovirus  (CMV) promoter that controls CCR5 expression, resulting in a 10-fold increase in cell surface co-receptor density. Female Balb/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 107 L1.2-CCR5" cells at 3-week intervals, and administered an intravenous boost of 107 Ll. 2-CCR5* cells  three days prior to splenectomy. Splenocytes were fused with the Sp2/0 cell line. In a primary screen, supernatants from ten  thousand  hybridoma  cultures  were  tested;  one hundred and twenty of these inhibited HIV-l envelope-mediated fusion between PMl cells (10), which naturally express CCR5 and CD4,  and HeLa-EnvJR-FL  cells  in a resonance energy transfer (RET) assay, as previously described (19, 38). Hybridomas that produced the most potently inhibitory supernatants and that also stained CCR5*  cells were  sub-cloned by  limiting  dilution. Ascites fluids were prepared by Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) from Balb/c mice that were injected with hybridomas producing the anti-CCR5 mAbs PA8, PA9, PA10, PA11, PA12 and PA14. The mAbs were individually   purified   to   &gt;95%   homogeneity   by precipitation  with  ammonium  sulfate  followed  by protein-A chromatography. All mAbs were resuspended in phosphate   buffered   saline   (PBS)   at   a   final concentration of 5mg/ml.<br>
3)   Fluorescence   activated   cell   sorting   (FACS)<br>
analysis and epitope mapping of anti-CCR5 mAbs Flow  cytometry  was  used  to  detect  cell-surface reactivity of mAbs PA8-PA12 and PA14 with CCR5. Sodium butyrate treated L1.2-CCR5* cells (106) were incubated<br>
with 0.25µg of antibody, for 20min at 4°C in 0.1% sodium azide (NaN3) in 50 µl of Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) . The CCR5 mAb 2D7 was used as a positive control, a non-specific murine IgGl was used as a negative control. The cells were spun down, washed and incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Caltag, Burlingame,<br>
8-CA) diluted 1:100, under the same conditions as the first antibody incubation. Finally, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. PBMC were isolated and stimulated as previously described (60) and stained using similar methods.<br>
A similar procedure was used for epitope mapping of the anti-CCR5 mAbs. A panel of seventy CCR5 point mutants has been described (20, 24, 52). The coding sequences of these proteins are sub-cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Stratagene) from which transcription can be driven by a 5' T7-polymerase promoter. The CCR5 mutants carry a 9-residue hemaglutinin (HA) tag at the C-terminus for detection of protein in cell lysates or by flow cytometry. HeLa cells (2xl06) were incubated for 5h with 20/ig/ml lipofectin and an equal amount of wild-type or mutant  CCR5-expressing plasmid in OPTI-MEM<br>
(Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) . The cells were then infected for 12h with 2xl07 p.f.u. of vTF7 (23) to boost CCR5 expression, detached with 2mM ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) in PBS and washed once with binding buffer (1% BSA, 0.05% NaN3 in DPBS) . Cells (lxlO6) were surface labeled with mAbs as described in the previous paragraph, washed once with the incubation buffer and resuspended in 1ml of lx FACSlyse in water (Becton Dickinson) for 30min at room temperature, to permeabilize the cell membranes. The cells were then spun down, washed with the incubation buffer and incubated for lh at 3 7°C with 4µg/ml of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mouse anti-HA mAb (BabCo, Richmond, CA) for intracellular labeling. Finally, cells were washed once with binding buffer and once with DPBS, resuspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. The extent of binding of a mAb to mutant CCR5 was determined by the equation<br>
(mutant CCR5 PE m.f.i. / wt CCR5 PE m.f.i.) / (mutant CCR5 FITC m.f.i. / wt CCR5 FITC m.f.i.) xl00%. This<br>
normalizes       mAb       binding        for       mutant        co-receptor expression  levels.<br>
4)	gpl20/sCD4-binding assay<br>
gpl20 was biotinylated using NHS-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and uncoupled biotin was removed by diafiltration. Sodium butyrate-treated L1.2-CCR5' cells were incubated with varying dilutions of an eguimolar mixture of sCD4 and biotinylated gpl20, or l.25µg/ml of sCD4 and 2.5µg/ml of biotinylated gpl20 in the presence of varying concentrations of anti-CCR5 mAbs PA8-PA12, PA14, 2D7 or a non-specific murine IgGl, for Ih at room temperature in 0.1% NaN3 in DPBS. Cells were washed with the incubation buffer and incubated with streptavidin-PE (Becton Dickinson) diluted 1:50, for lh at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed with binding buffer and analyzed using a fluorescence plate reader (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA).<br>
5)	Inhibition of envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion<br>
and HIV-l entry by anti-CCR5 mAbs<br>
HIV-1 envelope-mediated fusion between HeLa-EnvJR-FL and PMl cells was detected using the RET assay. Equal numbers (2x10*) of fluorescein octadecyl ester (F18)-labeled envelope-expressing cells and octadecyl rhodamine (R18)-labeled PMl cells were plated in 96-well plates  in  15%  fetal calf  serum  in DPBS  and<br>
incubated for 4h at 3 7°C in the presence of varying concentrations of the anti-CCR5 mAbs, PA8-PA12, PA14, 2D7 or a non-specific murine IgGl. Fluorescence RET was measured with a Cytofluor plate-reader (PerSeptive Biosystems) and % RET was determined as previously described (38).<br>
NLluc4env" viruses complemented in trans by envelope glycoproteins from JR-FL or Gun-l were produced as<br>
previously . described (20). U87MG-CD4*CCR5* cells (14) were infected with chimeric, reporter viruses containing 50-100µg/ml p24 in the presence of varying concentrations of the individual mAbs. After 2h at 37°c, virus-containing media were replaced by fresh, mAb-containing media. Fresh media, without antibodies, were added again after 12 hours. After a total of 72h, 100/il of lysis buffer (Promega) were added to the cells and luciferase activity (r.l.u.) was measured as described (20). The % inhibition of HIV-i infection is defined as [1-(r.l.u in the presence of antibody / r.l.u in the absence of antibody)] x 100%.<br>
6)   Calcium signaling assays<br>
The fluorochrome Indo-IAM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to sodium butyrate treated L1.2-CCR5.4 cells at a final concentration of 5|iM. After incubation<br>
at 37°C for 30min, the cells were washed once and resuspended in Hank's buffered saline. Cells (106) were stimulated sequentially with an anti-CCR5 mAb or PBS, followed 60s later with RANTES. MAbs PA8-PA12 and PA14 were used at a concentration of 100µg/ml, 2D7 at 20jjg/ml and RANTES at 250µg/ml. Calcium flux inhibition by PA14 and 2D7 was also tested for a wide range of mAb concentrations, ranging from 0-100µg/ml. Intracellular calcium levels were monitored using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50S fluorescence spectrophotometer by measuring the ratio of fluorescence emissions at 402nm (bound dye) and 4 86nm (free dye) following excitation at 358nm.<br>
B. Results and Discussion<br>
1)   Isolating  anti-CCR5  monoclonal  antibodies  PA8, PA9, PA10, PAH, PA12 and PA14<br>
It  was  found  that  pep-tides  corresponding  to  the extracellular  domains  of  CCR5  are  inefficient  at<br>
raising specific, high-titer antibody responses against the native, cell surface receptor (50). Balb/C mice were immunized, therefore, with L1.2-CCR5* cells and hybridoma culture supernatants were tested for their ability to inhibit JR-FL envelope-mediated membrane fusion with CD4*CCR5" PM1 cells in the RET assay (19, 38) . Even though well over a hundred supernatants inhibited cell-cell fusion by &gt;50%, only six designated PA8, PA9, PA10, PAH, PA12 and PA14 specifically and intensely stained L1.2-CCR5* but not the parental LI.2 cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometry (data not shown). Based on previous experience, it was assumed that the other mAbs capable of inhibiting cell-cell fusion were probably directed against cell surface adhesion molecules such as LFA-1 (37) . Hybridomas PA8-PA12 and PA14 were determined by isotyping ELISA (Cappell, Durham, NC) to secrete IgGl mAbs. Ascites fluids were prepared from Balb/C mice that were injected with the six hybridomas and the IgGl fractions were purified. PA8, PA9, PA11, PA12 and PA14 exhibited distinct isoelectric focussing profiles, whereas PA10 had a very similar profile to that of PA9 and therefore may be a second isolate of the same mAb (data not shown) .<br>
2)   MAb binding to CCR5+ cells<br>
None of the purified anti-CCR5 mAbs stained the parental Ll.2 cell line (data not shown). However, mAbs PA9-PA12 and PA14 stained &gt;90%, and PA8 stained -70%, of L1.2-CCR54 cells as determined by flow cytometry, showing they recognized CCR5 (Figure 1) . The anti-CCR5 mAb 2D7, which was a positive control in our experiments, also stained &gt;90% of L1.2-CCR5* cells. PA8-PA12 and PA14 are all IgGl, and react equally well with a goat anti-mouse IgG, whereas 2D7 is an IgG2a and may react differently with the reporter antibody. Only mean fluorescence intensities  (m.f.i.)  measured with mAbs<br>
PA8-PA12 and PA14 therefore are directly comparable. The rank order of mean fluorescence intensities (m.f.i.) was PA12- PA11&gt; (2D7=) PA14- PA10- PA9&gt; PA8. The difference between PA12 m.f.i. and PA8 m.f.i. was three-fold. Differences in staining intensity between PA8 and the other mAbs remained constant over a wide range of concentrations (data not shown) and probably do not correspond to differences in mAb affinities for CCR5. This implies that PA8 interacts only with a subset of CCR5 molecules present on the surface of Ll.2-CCR5" cells.<br>
Compared with L1.2-CCR5+ cells, mitogen-stimulated PBMC exhibited different patterns of staining by the anti-CCR5 mAbs. 2D7 and PA14 stained &gt;20%, PAll and PA12 stained -10%, PA8, PA9 and PA10 stained )  PA14&gt;  PA12-  PAll-  PA10-  PA9~  PA8 . Again,  this  differed  somewhat  from  the  order  of reactivities  observed  on  CCR5  transfectants.  The difference between PA9 m.f.i.  and  PA14  m.f.i.  was seven-fold.   Other  groups  have  observed  similar differences in the ability of anti-CCR5 mAbs to stain stable, CCR5* cell lines versus PBMC (28) . This may be due to cell-specific differences in CCR5 conformation, post-translational  modification  or  oligomerization. Alternatively,  association  with  other  cell  surface molecules may differ between cells. Since an obvious choice for such a molecule would be the CD4  cell surface antigen, which is absent from L1.2-CCR5' cells and present on PBMCs, we also tested the ability PA8-PA12,  PA14 and 2D7 to stain HeLa cells transiently expressing CCR5 alone or with CD4 . No differences were observed in the ability of any of the mAbs to stain cell surface CCR5 in the presence of CD4  (data not<br>
shown) . If there is an association between these two proteins, it does not involve epitopes recognized by the anti-CCR5 mAbs available to us. Alternatively, an association between CCR5 and CD4 might only occur on primary lymphocytes.<br>
3)   Epitope mapping of the mAbs using CCR5 alanine<br>
mutants None of the antibodies were able to detect reduced and denatured CCR5 protein by Western blotting indicating that they recognize conformationally sensitive epitopes (data not shown). MAb epitope mapping studies were performed using a panel of seventy alanine point mutants of residues in the Nt and ECLs of CCR5. HeLa cells were lipofected with mutant or wild type CCR5 coding sequences appended with C-terminal HA tags, and infected with vTF7 (23) to boost co-receptor expression. The cells were then incubated with the anti-CCR5 mAbs and their binding was revealed by a PE-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. A second, intracellular stain was performed with a FITC-labeled anti-HA mAb (BabCo). This internal control allowed us to directly normalize staining by the anti-CCR5 mAbs for mutant co-receptor expression levels on the cell surface. Hence, mAb binding to each mutant is expressed as a percentage of binding to wild-type CCR5 (Figure 4).<br>
Certain point mutations reduced the binding of all of the antibodies to CCR5 by &gt;50%. In general, PA8-PA12 were the most affected, PA14 and 2D7 the least affected by this class of mutants, which included the cysteine pair C101A and C178A, the Nt mutants Y10A, D11A, K25A, the ECLl mutant D95A, the ECL2 mutants K171A/E172A, Q18 8A, K191A/N192A, and the ECL3 mutants F263A and F264A (Fig. 1) . One interpretation is that these residues are not part of the mAb epitopes per se, but that changing them to alanines causes conformational<br><br>
perturbations that have a common effect on binding of all mAbs. We assumed that if a mutation lowered binding of an individual mAb by &gt;75%, and did not also lower binding of most of the other antibodies, the residue was probably a direct contributor to the epitope recognized by the mAb. Using these stringent guidelines, it was concluded that the seven anti-CCR5 mAbs recognize overlapping but distinct epitopes (Figure 4) . MAb PA8 binding to CCR5 depended on N13 and Y15 in the Nt. MAb PA9 and PA10 required D2, Y3, Q4, P8 and N13 in the Nt, and Y176 and T177 in ECL2. MAb PA9 also required S7 in the Nt. MAb PAH and PA12 binding depended on Q4 in the Nt. PA14 required D2 in the Nt, and R168 and Y176 in ECL2. Finally, mAb 2D7 required Q170 and K171/E172 in ECL2 in order to bind to CCR5.<br>
4)   Chemokine signaling in the presence of anti-CCR5<br>
mAbs Chemokine receptor-binding agents can be antagonists or,   more   rarely,   agonists  of   receptor-mediated intracellular signaling. Alternatively, they could have no effect on signaling. CCR5 is able to bind three CC-chemokines, RANTES, MlP-lα and MIP-1ß, and transduce a signal  that modulates  cytosolic calcium levels.  We therefore tested the agonist/antagonist activity of various concentrations of mAbs PA8-PA12, PA14 and 2D7. Changes  in  intracellular  calcium  concentrations, (Ca24)i,  were  measured  in  lndo-1-loaded  L1.2-CCR5* cells. None of the mAbs stimulated a change in (Ca2*)i, indicating that they are not agonists for CCR5. PA8-PA12 were also unable to inhibit Ca2
however, blocked calcium mobilization induced by RANTES, although with different potencies (Fig.5A, 5B). The IC50 for PA14 calcium influx inhibition was 50 µg/ml, which was approximately 8-fold higher than the IC50 for 2D7 (Fig. 5B). RANTES-, MIP-lα- and MIP-1ß-induced calcium fluxes were each inhibited by similar concentrations of PA14 (data not shown) . None of the mAbs affected SDF-1-induced calcium mobilization in L1.2-CCR5' cells, which endogenously express CXCR4 (data not shown). Finally, neither mAbs nor CC-chemokines affected cytosolic calcium levels in parental LI.2 cells (data not shown).<br>
5)   Inhibition of CCR5  co-receptor function by the mAbs<br>
MAbs PA8-PA12 and PA14 were initially selected on the basis  of  their  ability  to  inhibit  HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. This activity was confirmed and quantified for the purified mAbs. As expected, all six mAbs, as well as mAb 2D7, blocked fusion between CD4*CCR5* PM1 cells and HeLa-EnvJR-FL cells in the RET assay. The rank order of potency was 2D7- PA14&gt; PA12&gt; PAll&gt; PA10- PA9- PA8 (Fig. 6A) - IC50 values for PA14 and 2D7 were 1.7µg/ml and 1.6µg/ml respectively, for PA11 and   PA12   these   were   25.5µg/ml   and   10.0µg/ml respectively (Figure 3) . PA8, PA9 and PA10 inhibited fusion by only 10-15% at 300µg/ml. None of the mAbs affected fusion between PMl cells and HeLa-EnvLAI cells, which express the full length envelope protein from an X4 virus (data not shown).<br>
The ability of the different anti-CCR5 mAbs to inhibit entry of a prototypic R5 virus, JR-FL, and a R5X4 virus, Gun-1, in a single-round of replication, luciferase-based entry assay was also tested. The rank order of potency in the entry assay was similar to the<br>
one determined in the cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 6B) . A &gt;50% inhibition of JR-FL or Gun-l entry with PA8-PA11 was unable to be obtained. The IC50 value for PA12 was 2.5 µg/ml. However, inhibition of entry by &gt;60% with this mAb was unable to be obtained. The IC50 values for PA14 and 2D7 inhibition of JR-FL entry were determined to be 0.024 and 0.026 µg/ml respectively (Figure 3), and were 60-fold lower then those obtained in the fusion assay. Entry of dual-tropic Gun-1 was 2-3-fold more sensitive to inhibition by anti-CCR5 mAbs than JR-FL entry (data not shown).<br>
Anti-co-receptor mAbs might inhibit envelope-mediated fusion either by directly affecting the gpl20/CCR5 interaction or by impeding post-binding steps involved in the formation of an active fusion complex. To determine the mechanism of inhibition of viral fusion and entry by PA8-PA12 and PA14, the ability of the different mAbs to block the gpl20/CCR5 interaction was tested. For this an assay that detects binding to Ll.2-CCR5* cells of biotinylated HIV-1JR-FL, gpl20 complexed with sCD4 was used. No binding of biotinylated gpl2 0 was observed in the absence of sCD4 or CCR5, or when HIV-ILAI gpl20 was used (Fig. 6C) .<br>
With the exception of PA8, all mAbs abrogated gpl20/sCD4 binding to L1.2-CCR5" (Fig. 6D) . Inhibition by PA8 saturated at -4 0%, which concurs with flow cytometry data (Figure 1) in suggesting that this mAb binds only to a subset of CCR5 molecules on L1.2-CCR5* cells. MAbs PA9, PA10, PA11 and PA12 inhibited binding with IC50 values of 0.24, 0.13, 0.33, 0.24 µg/ml respectively (Figure 3) . Surprisingly, mAbs PA14 and 2D7 were the two least efficient inhibitors of gpl20/sCD4 binding, with IC50 values of 1.58 and 1.38 Hg/ml respectively (Figure 3). Therefore, there was no correlation between the ability of a mAb to inhibit<br>
gpl20/CD4/CCR5-mediated membrane fusion and entry and its ability to block gpi20/sCD4 binding to the co-receptor.<br>
6) Synergistic inhibition of HIV-i fusion by combinations of anti-CCR5 mAbs and other viral entry inhibitors<br>
Co-receptor-specific agents may act at multiple stages of the entry process and exhibit non-additive effects when used in combination. From a clinical perspective, it is important to determine the interactions of co-receptor-specific drug candidates with endogenous chemokines, which may afford some level of protection against disease progression. CCR5 mAbs were therefore tested in combination with each other or with RANTES, or with CD4-lgG2, which binds to HIV-i gpl2 0 to inhibit attachment to target cells. Dose-response curves were obtained for the agents used individually and in combination in viral fusion and entry assays. Data were analyzed using the median effect principle (9) . The concentrations of single-agents or their mixtures required to produce a given effect were quantitatively compared in a term known as the Combination Index (CI). A CI value greater than 1 indicates antagonism, CI ~ 1 indicates an additive effect, and CI 
Combinations of PA12 and 2D7 were the most potently synergistic, with CI values ranging between 0.02 and 0.29, depending on the ratio of the antibodies (Fig. 7 and Figure 2) . The degree of synergy is known to vary with the stoichiometry of the agents. The viral entry and fusion assays were generally consistent in identifying mAb combinations that are highly synergistic, PA12 and 2D7-; moderately synergistic, PA12<br>
and PA14 , additive, PAll and PA12; and weakly-antagonistic, PA14 and 2D7. The lack of synergy between PA14 and 2D7 is not surprising given that these mAbs cross-compete for binding to CCR5* cells as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown) . The observation of an additive effect of PA11 and PA12 may be an indication that these mAbs bind to slightly different epitopes in CCR5, while sharing a dependency on residue Q4 in the Nt.<br>
The ability of mAbs PA12, PA14 and 2D7 to synergize with RANTES in blocking cell-cell fusion was also tested. PA12 and RANTES combinations exhibited moderate synergy (Figure 2) . PA14 and 2D7 exhibited no synergy with RANTES, which is consistent with these mAbs being inhibitory of RANTES binding and signaling (Fig. 5A, 5B). Finally, we tested synergy between mAbs PA12, PA14, 2D7 and CD4-lgG2, which interacts with gpl20. We observed moderate synergy between PA12 and CD4-lgG2 but no synergy between PA14 or 2D7 and CD4-IgG2 (Figure 2).<br>
Experimental Discussion<br>
Six murine anti-CCR5 IgGl mAbs were isolated and characterized. Whereas PA8, PA9, PAll, PA12 and PA14 are distinct molecular species, PA9 and PA10 are indistinguishable by the analyses and therefore are probably the same mAb. All of the mAbs that were isolated recognize complex conformational epitopes, as is often the case with mAbs raised against native, cell surface proteins. Epitope mapping was performed for all mAbs using a panel of CCR5 alanine point mutants. Residues that affected binding of all mAbs similarly were assumed to cause conformational perturbations in the co-receptor and not to constitute part of the mAb epitopes. Only two such residues, Y10 and Dll, have been shown to affect HIV-l entry (20, 52) . The PA8, PAll and PA12 epitopes are located exclusively in the<br>
Nt domain. Consistent with this result, PA8 was able to bind a biotinylated Nt peptide, containing residues D2 through R31, in an ELISA (data not shown). However, PAll and PA12, whose binding strongly depended only on 04, did not bind the Nt peptide in solution (data not shown). One possibility is that the Nt peptide does not assume the proper conformation for recognition by PAll and PA12, whereas PA8 binding may be less conformation-dependent. Alternatively, PAll and PA12 might interact with residues that we have not mutated, or form weak bonds with amino acids located in other domains of CCR5, or bind peptide backbone atoms whose presentation may be unchanged by mutagenesis. Antibodies PA9, PA10 and PA14 recognized epitopes that included residues in both the Nt and ECL2 domains of CCR5, whereas the 2D7 epitope was located exclusively in ECL2.<br>
The PA14 epitope comprises both D2 in the Nt and R168 in ECL2 indicating that these two residues are proximal to one another within the context of a mAb footprint. They may even directly interact with one another through their opposite charges.<br>
MAbs PA8-PA12 and PA14 stained CCR5* cells with different intensities and in a cell type-dependent manner. All mAbs except PA8 stained &gt;90% L1.2-CCR5* cells, the highest mean fluorescence intensity being observed with PAll and PA12. However, PA14 and 2D7 stained the highest percentage of PBMC and also yielded the highest mean fluorescence intensities on these cells. Hill et al. (28) have recently characterized a panel of anti-CCR5 mAbs that similarly stained transfected cells, but only two of eight stained PBMC, and none stained primary monocytes. A low affinity for CCR5 probably accounted for the non-reactivity of two of the mAbs with primary cells, but this was unlikely to be the explanation for'the failure of the other four<br>
0-to react. In our mAb panel, we observe the most intense staining of PBMC by mAbs 2D7 and PA14 that have epitopes located entirely or partially in the first ten residues of ECL2. Hill et al. report, however, that mAbs specific for the Nt and ECL1 stain PBMCs, while mAbs to ECL2 and ECL3 do not stain PBMC, so a consistent pattern of reactivity has not been identified. One explanation for cell type-specific staining by mAbs would be that activated PBMCs (and monocytes) secrete CC-chemokines that bind to cell surface CCR5, masking some mAb epitopes. However, one would expect this to be especially true for PA14 and 2D7, which are antagonists of chemokine-induced calcium mobilization and presumably compete with CC-chemokines for binding to CCR5. Yet these mAbs stain PBMC the most intensely. Alternatively, differential CCR5 epitope exposure may reflect cell type-specific receptor oligomerization, association with other cell-surface molecules, or different post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. We have shown that differences in mAb binding probably do not reflect cell type-specific differences in CD4/CCR5 interactions.<br>
MAbs PA8-PA12 did not inhibit CC-chemokine induced calcium mobilization in CCR5* cells, nor did they mediate signaling through CCR5. MAbs 2D7 and PA14 were inhibitors of CC-chemokine induced calcium mobilization, but 2D7 was almost an order of magnitude more potent than PA14. This may be because the PA14 epitope overlaps less with the CC-chemokine binding domain on CCR5 than the 2D7 epitope. All of the mAbs also blocked HIV-i entry and envelope-mediated membrane fusion, but inhibition of cell-cell fusion required in some cases almost two orders of magnitude more antibody than what was needed to block viral entry. Presumably, more gpl20/CD4/CCR5 interactions as well as interactions between adhesion molecules are established<br>
and act cooperatively during cell-cell fusion, compared to virus-cell  fusion,  making  it  more  difficult  to inhibit. This is commonly observed with antibodies to LFA-1 or to the HIV-l envelope glycoprotein (45, 51) . PA8, PA9 and PA10 were unable to block cell-cell fusion by &gt;15% and viral entry by &gt;40%, even at the highest-antibody concentrations. However,  &gt;90% inhibition of fusion could be attained with PA11, PA12 and PA14 , and &gt;90% inhibition of entry could be attained with PA14 . The most potent of the six mAbs in blocking fusion and entry  was  PA14 ,  which  was  as  effective  as  2D7. Surprisingly, PA14 and 2D7 were among the least potent inhibitors of gpl20/sCD4 binding to L1.2-CCR5* cells, whereas PA9-PA12 blocked with similar potencies, and PA8 was unable to block &gt;40% of gpl20/sCD4 binding. These observations raise questions about the nature of the CCR5 molecules presented on different cells and about the mechanisms of inhibition of viral fusion and entry. It may be that CCR5 on LI.2 cells, used in the mAb and gpl20-binding assays, is not in an identical conformation to CCR5 on PBMC, used in the mAb-binding assay, or to CCR5 on PM1 and U87MG cells used in the fusion and entry assays.<br>
The low staining of PBMC and the partial inhibition of fusion and entry by some of our mAbs indicate that they are only able to bind to a subset of CCR5 molecules expressed on primary lymphocytes, PMl and U87MG-CD4*CCR5* cell lines. Yet, other than PA8, all mAbs are able to stain &gt;90% L1.2-CCR5* cells and to completely block binding of the gpl20/sCD4 complex to these cells. At least one difference between L1.2-CCR5* and the other cells that we have used is the density of co-receptor protein on the cell surface. Indeed, we estimate that the L1.2-CCR5* cells express 10- to 100-fold more cell surface co-receptor than PMl and U87MG-CD4'CCR5* cells. But  when HeLa  cells are engineered to transiently<br>
express as much co-receptor as the L1.2-CCR5* cell line, we are still unable to detect gpl20/sCD4 binding to them (data not shown). Over-expression of CCR5 on LI.2, along with other cell-specific factors therefore, might favor a co-receptor conformation that prominently exposes the Nt, making it more accessible to both mAbs and gpl20. Such a conformation might be induced by-receptor oligomerization, by diminished or altered associations with cell surface proteins or by receptor interactions with G proteins (25, 62) . Do multiple conformations of CCR5 co-exist on the cell surface, and are they all permissive for viral entry? The patterns of mAb reactivity would suggest so, since HIV-l entry and fusion can occur, albeit at reduced levels, in the presence of mAb concentrations that saturate epitopes required for gpl20 binding to L1.2-CCR5+ cells. We favor the hypothesis that the co-receptor molecules present on L1.2-CCR5* cells possess one HIV-l entry-competent conformation whereas CCR5 molecules on PBMC, PMl and CCR5* U87MG exist in multiple, entry-competent states that display different mAb reactivities. Whereas PA14 and 2D7 may recognize all conformations, other mAbs may not. Why LI . 2 cells are conducive to a particular fusion-competent conformation remains to be determined.<br>
It has recently been demonstrated that the gpl20-binding domain lies in the first twenty residues of the CCR5 Nt domain. MAbs to the gpl20-binding domain on CCR5 potently block this interaction but are not nearly as efficient at inhibiting HIV-l fusion and entry into target cells as PA14 and 2D7, whose epitopes lie outside this region. PA14 recognizes the tip of the Nt and residues in ECL2, whereas the 2D7 epitope is located exclusively in ECL2. At the mechanism of action of these mAbs can only be speculated. It may be that their binding to the first few residues of ECL2 induces<br>
conformational changes in the co-receptor that prevent membrane fusion. Alternatively, obstruction of ECL2 epitopes might impede co-receptor oligomerization and the formation of a fusion-competent protein complex. Yet another possibility is that residues in ECL2 face the inside of the fusion pore and binding of the mAbs impedes gp41 from inserting the fusion peptide into the plasma membrane. In contrast, mAbs PA8-PA12 probably inhibit fusion and entry only by directly competing for binding with gpl20/CD4 complexes. We do not know if parameters other than epitope exposure and affinity for CCR5 determine the efficacy of viral entry inhibition by these mAbs. It is unclear why inhibiting steps subsequent to the gpl20/co-receptor interaction would be more efficient than directly blocking that interaction. One way to explain this would be to assume that the off rate of gpl20 binding to CCR5 is much lower than the on rate of mAb binding to CCR5. Thus, every time a mAb detaches itself from a co-receptor molecule, a virion-associated gpl20 molecule replaces it in a quasi-irreversible fashion since this interaction leads to membrane fusion.<br>
Synergy between combinations of anti-CCR5 mAbs is probably a result of their interactions with distinct epitopes that are involved in inter-dependent, consecutive steps of HlV-l entry. The degree of synergy observed between PA12 and 2D7 (CI
between PA12 and CD4-IgG2. The CD4/gpl20 complex is metastable and if it is unable to interact with a co-receptor, decays into a non-fusogenic state (45-48) . Since PA12 directly blocks the gpl20-binding site on CCR5, its presence may shift the equilibrium towards inactivation of the gpl20/CD4 complex. This would explain why we observe synergy between CD4-IgG2 and mAb PA12 with respect to inhibition of fusion and entry. The lack of synergy between mAb PA14 and CD4-IgG2 suggests that they act on two non-consecutive and independent steps of viral entry. A combination of further studies will be needed to determine the precise mechanisms of synergy of the different compounds with respect to inhibition of viral fusion and entry.<br>
The above results are consistent with a model wherein HIV-l entry occurs in three distinct steps involving receptor binding, co-receptor binding, and co-receptor mediated membrane fusion. Separate co-receptor binding and fusion events are suggested by the lack of correlation between the monoclonal antibodies' abilities to block gpl20 binding and HIV-l fusion/entry. The chronology of events during fusion is further suggested by the patterns of synergies observed. Agents, such as PA12, that potently inhibit the middle step of the process, namely gp 120 binding, act synergistically with inhibitors of prior and subsequent steps.<br>
Example 2<br>
Background: The increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant HIV-l mandates the search for novel classes of antiretroviral agents. CCR5 is a requisite fusion coreceptor for primary HIV-l isolates and provides a promising target for antiviral therapy. PRO140 is an<br><br>
5-anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody that potently inhibits HIV-1 entry and replication at concentrations that do not affect CCR5's chemokine receptor activity in vitro. In the present study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of PRO 140 in vivo using a therapeutic animal model of HIV-1 infection.<br>
Methods: CD-17 SCID mice were reconstituted with normal human PBMC and infected with the R5 isolate HIV-1 JR-CSF. When viral steady state was reached, the animal were treated intraperitoneally with PRO 140 or control antibody and monitored for viral burden using the Roche Amplicor assay. Initial studies examined a single 1 mg dose of PRO140. In multi-dose studies, PRO 140 was administered once every three days for three weeks at doses ranging from 0.1-1.0 mg. In a separate experiment, flow cytometry was used to examine the potential for lymphocyte depletion following PRO 14 0 injection.<br>
Results: Both single-dose and multi-dose PRO 140 reduced viral loads to undetectable levels in all treated animals, and the viral load reductions ranged to 1.8 log 10. A transitory control of viral replication was observed following single injection of PRO 140 while multiple injections led to a prolonged control with no evidence of viral rebound during therapy. Dose-dependent differences were observed in the kinetics of the PRO 140-mediated reductions in viral load. Flow cytometry analysis showed that treatment with PRO 14 0 did not lead to lymphocyte depletion, confirming that impact on viral replication in  vivo  was solely due to CCR5-blockage.<br>
Conclusions: PRO 140 is highly effective in controlling established HIV-1 infection in the hu-PBL-SCID mouse model of HIV-1 infection. These findings provide in vivo proof-of-concept for PRO 140 therapy in particular and for CCR5-inhibitors therapy in general.<br>
