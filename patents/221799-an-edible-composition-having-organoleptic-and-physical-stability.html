(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FOOD COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
1 <br>
FOOD COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the invention <br>
5<br>
The present invention relates to edible compositions comprising<br>
fat and transition metals, divalent metals and/or their<br>
compounds. The compositions have good organoleptic stability<br>
and physical stability upon storage.<br>
10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The incidence of obesity and the number of people considered overweight in countries where a so-called Western diet is adopted<br>
15 has drastically increased over the last decade. Since obesity and being overweight are generally known to be associated with a variety of diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and arthereosclerosis, this increase is a major health concern for the medical world and for individuals alike.<br>
20 Furthermore, being overweight is considered by the majority of the Western population as unattractive.<br>
This has led to an increasing interest by consumers in their health and has created a demand for products that help to reduce<br>
25 or control daily caloric intake and/or control body weight and/or bodily appearance. Several solutions have been proposed to help individuals to control their weight. Among these solutions is the use of drugs e.g. to suppress the activity of enzymes in the digestive system. However the use of drugs is often not preferred<br>
30 unless strictly required for medical purposes.<br>
Another proposed solution to the problem of being overweight is to prescribe the individuals concerned a specific diet, for example, a diet with a restricted caloric intake per day. A 35 problem with these diets is that often they do not provide a<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
2<br>
healthy nutritional balance and/or they are difficult to accommodate in modern lifestyles.<br>
Meal replacer products have also been proposed as part of a<br>
5 	healthy diet in order to control or reduce body weight.  For example, US 5,688,547 discloses a nutritional meal replacement composition comprising dietary fibre, protein, a cellulose gum and gel.<br>
10 	These meal replacer products are generally products that are intended to be consumed as a single-serving food product, such as a bar or a drink etc to replace one or two meals per day. The meal replacer products are designed such that on the one hand they provide a restricted caloric intake, but on the other<br>
15 	hand they provide a healthy balance of nutritional ingredients and are convenient to incorporate into an individual's daily diet.<br>
In order to provide a healthy balance of nutritional <br>
20	ingredients food products may be fortified with micronutrients such as transition metals and their compounds. This is especially true for food products which are intended to be used in a weight loss or weight maintenance plan where the subject consuming the food may be eating a calorie restricted and <br>
25 	potentially nutritionally restricted diet (see for example US 5,688,547).<br>
However, a general problem with micronutrient fortified food products (especially those intended to be used in a weight loss <br>
30   or weight maintenance plan such as meal replacer products or 	low-calorie snacks) is that whilst the addition of transition 	metals and their compounds provides nutritional benefits to 	the subject consuming the product, the organoleptic properties 	and/or<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
3<br>
stability, including physical stability, of the product or the ingredients used therein can be adversely affected.<br>
In particular, the organoleptic properties of the product can be <br>
5  adversely affected upon storage resulting in a deterioration in one or more of product taste, mouthfeel or texture.  These stability problems can manifest themselves in several ways; the products may change colour with time and/or may exhibit some degree of physical instability such as phase separation (e.g. <br>
10 separation of an oil phase) and/or may exhibit some degree of chemical instability of one or more ingredients (e.g. 	oxidation of oxidation sensitive ingredients such as certain fats).<br>
In the presence of transition metals and their compounds, the <br>
15 organoleptic properties, colour stability and chemical stability in particular of the food product can be adversely affected.<br>
The above-mentioned problems are generally made more acute when the edible composition comprises fat. For example, many fats are<br>
20 susceptible to oxidation because they are not very chemically stable and this can lead to off flavour development in the product with time. This is particularly noticeable when the edible composition comprises an unsaturated fat, such as sunflower oil. However, such ingredients are desirably included<br>
 25  to give a beneficial nutritional profile to the composition.<br>
This deterioration of organoleptic properties and/or stability upon storage is/are especially problematic upon prolonged storage<br>
at elevated temperatures (e.g. 30 C for 4 weeks), or, when the<br>
30 edible composition is subjected to a heat treatment step during preparation (e.g. a pasteurisation or other sterilisation step) which may be used to prepare an ambient stable food product.<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
4<br>
Also, the problems of providing good mouthfeel of the composition are especially pertinent to compositions that comprise relatively low levels of fat in order to control the levels of calories <br>
5 	provided by fat. Such products may be so-called 'low-fat' versions of full fat products. Consumers typically desire the mouthfeel that a higher fat product provides but without the levels of fat associated therewith.<br>
10 	Whilst consumers express a preference for foods which are<br>
considered as healthy and which can assist them to achieve their weight loss goals they show little inclination to sacrifice the organoleptic properties of their favorite foods.<br>
15 	Therefore, the successful food formulator must improve the nutrient value of the food while maintaining desirable organoleptic properties and stability. In particular the appearance and/or texture of such foods may deteriorate upon storage as may the physical stability of the product and/or of<br>
20 	one or more of its ingredients.<br>
US 6,245,803 (Abbott Labs) discloses an elemental nutritional formula that claims to be nutritionally complete for humans with specialised dietary needs. The formula uses specific free<br>
25 	amino acids (L-asparagine monohydrochloride and L-glutamine) and has 38 to 50% of the calories in the formula provided by fat. The formula may comprise esterified glycerol emulsifiers.<br>
US 6,248,375 (Abbott Labs) discloses solid matrix materials <br>
30 	designed for the person with diabetes. It includes a two component carbohydrate system which is said to blunt the postprandial carbohydrate response. One of the forms for administration mentioned is nutritional bars. In the examples<br><br>

However, despite the above developments, there still remains a need in the art to provide a solution to the problems mentioned <br>
20 	hereinabove.<br>
Recognising the demand for effective and convenient food products that maintain good organoleptic properties and stability when certain micronutrients (especially transition<br>
25 	metals or their compounds) are incorporated therein, research has been carried out to try to address one or more of the problems associated therewith.<br>
In particular, there is a still a need for edible compositions 30 	comprising transition metals, divalent metals and/or their<br>
compounds at nutritionally advantageous levels, but which are of acceptable organoleptic properties for the consumer. In particular, there is a need for such edible compositions which<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
6<br>
maintain good taste (e.g. do not develop off-flavours), mouth feel or texture upon storage and/or when made by a process including a heat treatment step.<br>
5	There is also still a need for edible compositions comprising transition metals, divalent metals and/or their compounds at nutritionally advantageous levels and which are convenient and/or economical to manufacture but which exhibit good stability of the product and/or its ingredients during manufacture and storage. <br>
10   There is particularly a need for such compositions which exhibit good physical stability in terms of colour stability and/or good chemical stability of ingredients (e.g. resistance to oxidation).<br>
There is also still a need for edible compositions comprising <br>
15 	transition metals and/or their compounds at nutritionally<br>
advantageous levels and which exhibit one or more of the above organoleptic properties and stability upon storage, especially upon prolonged storage at elevated temperatures (e.g. 30 C for 4weeks), or, when the edible composition is subjected to a heat <br>
20   treatment step during preparation (e.g. a pasturisation or other 	sterilisation step) which may be used to prepare an ambient 	stable food product.<br>
All of the above is especially applicable to meal replacement <br>
25 	products or other calorie-controlled products intended to be consumed as part of a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems. <br>

PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
7 Summary of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that one or more of the above problems can be ameliorated when an edible composition <br>
5 	comprising a controlled level of fat and at least one transition metal, divalent metal or compound thereof, and further comprises a certain type of emulsifier.<br>
Thus according to a first aspect the present invention provides <br>
10 	an edible composition comprising fat and:<br>
1)	at least one transition metal, divalent metal, transition metal compound or divalent metal compound, and<br>
2)	0.01 to 50 %wt based on the weight of the fat, of emulsifier comprising a carboxylic ester group attached to a "<br>
15  carbon chain having 3-6 carbon atoms and one or more free hydroxyl groups, wherein the emulsifier compound comprises a mixture of esterified glycerol emulsifiers and esterified alginates, and further wherein 30% or less of the kilocalories in the<br>
20 edible composition are provided from the fat.<br>
 It is also especially preferred that the edible compositions          comprises a mixture of esterified glycerol emulsifiers and/or esterified alginates with at least one stabiliser and/or at <br>
25 least one thickener.<br>
Preferably the stabiliser is a pectin. Preferably the thickener is selected from starches or gum. It is most preferred that both a stabiliser and a thickener is used and that the <br>
30 stabiliser is pectin and the thickener is a gum such as guar gum.<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
8<br>
The edible compositions do not to suffer unacceptably from a deterioration in taste, texture or mouthfeel upon storage. The edible compositions also do not to suffer unacceptably from a deterioration in stability upon storage, especially not in<br>
5 	colour stability and/or chemical stability of the products or its ingredients.<br>
It is preferred that the edible compositions of the invention do not suffer from the aforementioned problems for at least 4<br>
10 	months upon storage at 20 C, more preferably at least 6 months.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that emulsifiers retard the detrimental action of the transition metal ions and/or divalent metal ions upon the fats present in<br>
15 	the edible composition, probably by providing an effective barrier between them and the fat. This may occur by crystalisation at the fat surface, e.g oil droplet surface, thereby forming a tightly packed physical barrier. Alternatively or additionally the claimed emulsifiers may<br>
20 	exhibit a metal chelating effect. Some of the claimed<br>
emulsifiers may interact with any protein present in the edible compositions to provide a further physical barrier between the transition and/or divalent metal ion and the fat, where the protein is present at the oil/water interface. This also has<br>
25 		the additional advantage of aiding the physical stability of the food product by reducing the possibility of protein aggregation therein.<br>
The term "comprising"' is meant not to be limiting to any <br>
30 	subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
9<br>
exhaustive. Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br>
5 	Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where<br>
otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about".  All amounts are by<br>
10 	weight, based on the total weight of the relevant product, unless otherwise specified.<br>
Unless stated otherwise or required by context, the terms "fat" and "oil" are used interchangeably herein. Also, unless stated <br>
15 	otherwise or required by context, the terms "nutritional<br>
bar(s)" and "nutrition bar(s)" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
For a more complete explanation of the above and other features and advantages of the invention, reference should be made to <br>
20 	the following description of the preferred embodiments. The<br>
preferred embodiments apply to all aspects of the invention and can be used as appropriate for each aspect.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
25<br>
Fat<br>
The source for the fat used in the edible composition may be an animal or vegetable fat, or mixtures thereof. Monosaturated and/or polyunsaturated fats and mixtures thereof are especially<br>
30 	preferred. Preferred polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 oils such as fish oils and linseed oils. Preferred omega-3 fatty acids are the following C18:3, C18:4, C20:4, C20:5, C22:5 and C22:6. Any oil comprising omega 3 fatty acids, especially<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
10<br>
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C20:5) and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C22:5) may be used.<br>
Preferably the fat is selected from vegetable fats, such as for <br>
5  	example; cocoa butter, illipe, shea, palm, palm kernal, sal, soybean, safflower, cottonseed, coconut, rapeseed, canola, corn and sunflower oils, linoleic acids and conjugated linoleic acids, linolenic acid or mixtures thereof. However, animal fats such as butter fat may also be used if consistent with the <br>
10 	desired nutritional profile of the product.<br>
According to the present invention, 30% or less of the kilocalories in the edible composition are provided from the fat. It is preferred that 25% or less of the kilocalories in <br>
15 	the edible composition are provided from the fat, more preferably 20% or less.<br>
Preferably the amount of fat in the edible composition is not more than 45 wt%, especially not more than 35 wt%, preferably <br>
20 	from 0.5 to 20 wt%, still preferably from 1 to 15 wt%, based on the weight of the edible composition and subject to the requirements of the present invention regarding the percentage of calories that come from the fat.<br>
25 	Transition metals and transitional metal compounds<br>
According to the invention the edible composition comprises at least one transition metal or transition metal compound.<br>
The transition metal is preferably selected from chromium, <br>
30 	manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc and mixtures thereof and the transition metal compounds are preferably compounds of these transition metals. It has been found that<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
11<br>
iron, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc can cause particular taste and sensorial problems in edible compositions.<br>
The edible compositions typically comprise up to 100%, <br>
5 	typically up to 55%, preferably 30 to 50%, most preferably 35 to 45%, per serving of the composition of a given metal, based on the amounts given in the European Commission Directive 96/8/EC of 26 February 1996 on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction. The exact amount<br>
10 	of the transition metal and/or transition metal compound will depend upon the type used and how frequently that type of edible composition is intended to be consumed.<br>
The amounts given in the aforementioned directive are; 1 mg of <br>
15 	manganese, 1.1 mg of copper, 9.5 mg of zinc and 16 mg of iron.<br>
The edible composition preferably comprises one or more of up to 0.5 mg of manganese, up to 0.4 mg of copper, up to 3 mg of zinc or up to 5 mg of iron and mixtures thereof per serving <br>
20 	thereof.<br>
The at least one transition metal or transition metal compound<br>
may be in a substantially water insoluble form at 20 C and this<br>
is preferred according to the invention. The transition metal <br>
25 	or transition metal compound may be provided in the<br>
substantially water insoluble form by any suitable means. It is preferred that either a substantially water insoluble salt is used, or, that a suitable encapsulate is used to achieve the desired level of water insolubility. <br>
30<br>
It is advisable to ensure that the transition metal or transition metal compound is in a substantially water insoluble<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
12<br>
form at all processing temperatures to which the edible composition is subjected during its preparation and ideally also at 5°C or more above the maximum temperature reached.<br>
5 	Any substantially water insoluble compound of a transition metal may be used according to the invention, especially substantially water insoluble inorganic compounds. Such compounds selected from oxides, carbonates and phosphates including pyrophosphates are preferred. If copper is used then <br>
10 	copper carbonate is preferred. If iron is used then ferric<br>
pyrophosphate is preferred. If zinc is used then zinc oxide is preferred.<br>
Alternatively, or additionally, the transition metal or <br>
15 	transition metal compound may be encapsulated to render it<br>
substantially water insoluble. This provides a wider choice of the types of transition metal compounds which may be used and may allow for the inclusion of a more bioavailable compound. Any suitable encapsulant may be used. It is especially<br>
20 	preferred that an encapsulant is used which does not allow any significant water transmission across the encapsulation layer at temperatures below the melting point of the encapsulant. This is especially important where the encapsulated transition metal or transition metal compound is subjected to elevated <br>
25 	temperatures, e.g. of 60°C or more during the preparation of the edible composition.<br>
The term "encapsulated" refers both to an embodiment wherein a coating is substantially formed around the transition metal or <br>
30 	transition metal compound and to an embodiment wherein the<br>
transition metal or transition metal compound is trapped within or throughout a matrix so that it is rendered substantially water insoluble. The transition metal or transition metal<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
13<br>
compound preferably has a substantially integral encapsulant coating or matrix around it.<br>
Suitable encapsulant materials include substantially water<br>
5 	insoluble edible waxes, proteins, fibres, carbohydrates. The encapsulant material may be cross-linked.<br>
Proteins which may be used as the entire encapsulant material, or as a part thereof, include gelatin, milk proteins (including<br>
10 	caseinates, such as sodium caseinate, and whey proteins such as beta-lactoglobulin and alpha lactalbumin), albumin and vegetable proteins including proteins from beans, legumes and cereals such as soy, pea, maize and wheat and isolated soy proteins.<br>
15<br>
Carbohydrates which may be used as the entire encapsulant material, or as a part thereof, include mono or polysaccharides including, cellulose polymers and starches, (including hydrolysed and modified starches) and sugar alcohols. Suitable<br>
20 	materials include gum arabic, carrageenan, agar agar,<br>
alginates, pectins and pectates. Preferred encapsulants are carbohydrates such as alginates or pectins, especially including the sodium, potassium and calcium salts of alginates.<br>
25 	Mixtures of sodium caseinate and either gum arabic, carrageenan, agar agar, and gum arabic, are suitable. Similarly, beta-lactoglobulin and either gum arabic, carrageenan, agar agar, alginate or pectins, especially beta-lactoglobulin and gum arabic may be used.<br>
30<br>
It is preferred that the weight ratio of the transition metal and/or transition metal compound to the encapsulant is in the<br><br>
WO 2005/023018<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009359<br><br>
14<br>
range of from 5:1 to 1:15, preferably 1:2 to 1:12, e.g. 1:5 to 1:10.<br>
The transition metal or transition metal compound may be<br>
5 	encapsulated by any suitable encapsulation technique as known in the art, such as coacervation or spraying on, and does not require further explanation here.<br>
By the term "substantially water insoluble" is meant that the <br>
10 	transition metal or transition metal compound does not<br>
substantially dissolve in water, in particular that it has a solubility in water at 20°C of lg/l00g deionised water or less, preferably 0.5g/100g deionised water or less.<br>
15 		The present invention also provides a method of stabilizing edible compositions comprising at least one divalent metal or divalent metal compound by the use of the same emulsifier compound in the same amounts and having the same features as for the transition metals, as these compositions may suffer<br>
20 	from the same problems as compositions comprising transition metals. The divalent metals and/or divalent metal compounds may be present in the amounts given herein for the transition metal ions and their compounds. All of the comments given above for transition metals and their compounds apply equally to divalent<br>
