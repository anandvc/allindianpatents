DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPOSITION AND FOODS FOR LOWERING GLYCEMIC INDEX<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for lowering a glycemic index and a low-glycemic index food.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
According to the survey conducted in 1997 by today's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the number of people who are strongly suspected to be diabetic patient is estimated to be about 6.9 million, and the number of people who are undeniable to be diabetic patient is said to reach about 6.8 million. The number of diabetic patients including potential diabetic patients is said to reach about 20 million. The reasons for the increase in the number of diabetic patients are divided into genetic factors and those originated from living habits such as "obesity, hyperphagia, lack of exercise, and irregular lifestyle", and mainly the number of the diabetic patients caused by the latter reasons has been increasing. The mechanism of the onset is that in the case of hyposecretion of insulin associated with postprandial hyperglycemia, or when insulin is secreted but shows resistance and does not work as a hormone, disordered saccharometabolism takes place, which results in diabetes. Therefore, diet regimen which limits the carbohydrates from meal or pharmacotherapy such as a sugar absorption inhibitor is used for metabolizing sugar with limited insulin.<br>
In accordance with the social climate as described above, as a result of<br><br>
recent progress in development of artificial pancreas or widespread use of self monitoring of blood glucose, normalization of blood glucose over a period of 24 hours has been revealed to be essential for the onset and development of diabetic angiopathy, and the concept of a glycemic index (hereinafter referred to as GI value in some cases) of foods has been introduced by Jenkins et al. in 1982 (see, for example, Jenkins DJ, Ghafari H, Wolever TM, Taylor RH, Jenkins AL, Barker HM, Fielden H, Bowling AC: Relationship between rate of digestion of foods and post-prandial glycaemia, Diabetologia, Vol. 22,450-455 (1982)).<br>
A glycemic index of a food refers to an index showing the magnitude of the peak of blood glucose level which elevates when the food is ingested. Generally, the glycemic index is obtained by indexation of change of blood glucose level after ingesting various foods as compared with the blood glucose level after ingesting glucose, when the index of any of glucose, polished rice and bread is defined as 100. The lower this index is, the smaller the amount of insulin that functions to lower blood glucose level secreted. When the glycemic index is high, since insulin is secreted in excess, beta-cells of islets of Langerhans of pancreas become strained, which leads to onset of diabetes. Briefly, it is considered that the glycemic index of a food to be ingested is controlled, thereby reducing the load on pancreas whereby the onset of diabetes can be prevented. Since it has been found that sudden elevation in postprandial blood glucose level increases the load on the secretion of insulin from beta-cells of islets of Langerhans of pancreas in diabetic patients, this index has been already used in a standard dietary direction or the like for diabetic patients in Australia or the like.<br>
Some attempts to control a glycemic index have been made so far.<br><br>
Heaton et al. has reported that a glycemic index is controlled by difference in particle sizes of wheat, maize, and oat (see, for example, Heaton KW, Marcus SN, Emmett PM, Bolton CH: Particle size of wheat, maize, and oat test meals: effects on plasma glucose and insulin responses and on the rate of starch digestion in vitro, Am. J. Clin. Nutr., Vol. 47, 675-682 (1988)). Moreover, it has been known that a glycemic index of a food is lower when ingesting boiled rice than ingesting powdered rice and lower when ingesting an apple in whole than ingesting a "pureed" apple (see, for example, Kunihiro Doi and Keisuke Tsuji Eds., Shokumotsu Sen-i (Dietary Fiber), p.412-420 (Asakura-shoten, Tokyo, 1997)). Besides, methods utilizing a polysaccharide having gel formation ability, such as guar gum, pectin, or glucomannan have been known. These are the methods for lowering the GI value of a food, in which extension of endogastric residence time of glucose due to gel formation (see, for example, "Kagaku to Seibutsu {Chemistry and Biology)," Vol. 18, p95-105,1980).<br>
These attempts are, however, methods of controlling the GI value utilizing the difference in digestion and absorption depending upon the forms of foods, so that it is necessary to process foods to utilize. Therefore, these methods have limitations of the cost required for processing or the foods which can be used. There is also a problem that the forms of the foods are limited, and that the polysaccharide having gel formation ability, such as guar gum or pectin, is very highly viscous, thereby making it difficult to add the polysaccharide to an ordinary food or to process the polysaccharide.<br>
Now, methods for inhibiting a drastic elevation in blood glucose level using a hydrolyzed guar gum as an active principle are reported (see, for example, a publication of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-117156 (on<br><br>
pages 1 to 4)). Generally, it is believed that the inhibitory effect on elevation in blood glucose level is exhibited by guar gum, which is a kind of a natural polysaccharide in the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean components. On the other hand, it has not so far been reported that inhibitory effect on elevation in blood glucose level is exhibited or enhanced by using a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein.<br>

Further, a low-GI value food or feed can be easily obtained by adding the composition to an ordinary food or feed. Moreover, according to the present invention, a low-glycemic index food comprising specified carbohydrate-related components as described above is provided. The composition, food and feed of the present invention can significantly contribute to reduce the load on beta-cells of islets of Langerhans of pancreas for insulin secretion resulting from ingestion of a food and the like, and therefore can be effectively used for prevention of onset of diabetes or amelioration of diabetes.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
Generally, a GI value is a term used for foods for human. However, the term may be used herein for feed as well as foods. The phrase "GI value for a food or feed" as used herein refers to numerically expressed change in blood glucose level upon ingestion of a food or feed in an amount 50 g calculated as the carbohydrates, wherein the elevation or the lowering in the blood glucose level in the case where 50 g of glucose was ingested by an individual is defined as 100. Concretely, the "GI value for a food or feed" can be obtained from the following formula:<br>
GI value = [(Area below the curve of blood glucose level until 2 or 3 hours after ingesting a food or feed (amount calculated as carbohydrates: 50 g)) / (Area below the curve of blood glucose level until 2 or 3 hours after ingesting glucose (50 g))] x 100<br>
In the formula, the "area below the curve of blood glucose level" is obtained by drawing the graph of the blood glucose level of an individual to a time period after ingestion of a food or feed, or glucose by an individual, and calculating the area below the curve of blood glucose level until 2 or 3 hours after ingestion. Here, the time after ingesting a food or feed and the time after ingesting glucose are set to have the same conditions. The glucose serving as a standard can be replaced with bread as long as the bread weighs 50 g calculated as carbohydrates.<br>
The phrase "lowering (of) a GI value" as used herein means that the GI value of the food or feed is lowered when the composition for lowering a glycemic index of the present invention is applied to the food or feed, as compared with the GI value of a food or feed before application of the<br><br>
composition, to which the composition is to be applied (for example, ingested concomitantly with the composition).<br>
The low-glycemic index food (including feed) as used herein refers to a food of which GI value is lowered as compared to that of a conventional food corresponding to the food (referred to herein as a corresponding food) upon the determination in an identical individual. The lowering ratio of a GI value can be obtained from the following formula:<br>
Lowering ratio of GI value (%) = [1 - (GI value of food to be judged) /<br>
(GI value of the corresponding food)] x 100<br>
wherein a food which is to be judged whether or not to be a low-glycemic index food is expressed as a food to be judged. The lowering ratio of a GI value is preferably 10%, and more preferably 20%.<br>
The lowering of a GI value may be found at a point 2 or 3 hours after the ingestion of the food or feed.<br>
The GI value cannot be flatly defined because the lowering of GI values varies among individuals or depending on the determination conditions. The GI value of the low-glycemic index food of the present invention is preferably 70 or less, and more preferably 60 or less.<br>
Each of the composition for lowering a GI value and the low-GI value food of the present invention will be separately explained hereinafter. Each component of the composition and the food of the present invention described below can be appropriately used alone or in a mixture of two or more kinds.<br><br>
[1]    Composition for Lowering a Glycemic Index<br>
A great feature of the composition for lowering a GI value of a food or feed of the present invention (hereinafter referred to as a composition) resides in that the composition comprises a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein and a degraded galactomannan.<br>
Surprisingly, the present inventors have found for the first time that especially use of a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein, which has not yet been reported to have an inhibitory effect on elevation in blood glucose level, concomitantly with a degraded galactomannan (for example, the above-mentioned hydrolyzed guar gum) known for the effect and ingestion of these together with a food can synergistically remarkably lower the GI value of the food as compared to any of the substances which are known for their inhibitory effects on elevation in blood glucose level. Although the details of the mechanism for exhibiting the synergistic effects of a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein and a degraded galactomannan in lowering a GI value of a food are unclear, it is presumed that a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein has some influences on the inhibitory effect on elevation in blood glucose level by a degraded galactomannan, thereby synergistically improving the effects.<br>
The Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein contained in the composition of the present invention includes all sorts of proteins which can be extracted from Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans. The protein also includes a protein which is not extracted directly from Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans. For example, when the gene sequence of a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein is known, those proteins obtained by genetic engineering on the basis of the<br><br>
sequence according to known methods are also included. Further, as long as the desired effects of the present invention can be exhibited, the protein can be a variant of a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein containing a mutation in one or more amino acids. The protein as referred to herein is a peptide having at least 3 amino acid residues. Moreover, the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein may be composed of a single protein, or a mixture of two or more kinds of proteins.<br>
The Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein of the present invention can be easily obtained, for example, by treating Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans by a combined method of known purifying means for proteins. For example, the method is preferably, but not particularly limited to, the following method.<br>
Using Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans as a raw material, soluble components are eluted with an aqueous solvent of pH from 7 to 9, such as water or an aqueous alkali solution. The Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans may be pulverized before or after subjecting the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans to the solvent as desired. The mixture after the elution of soluble components is subjected to centrifugation, and thereafter insoluble components are removed in the form of precipitates. An acid is added to the supernatant to adjust the pH to about 4.5, and the protein is allowed to precipitate. The mixture is subjected to centrifugation again, to separate the mixture into a supernatant and precipitates. The procedures of adding water to the precipitates to disperse the precipitate, and centrifuging the dispersion are repeated, to wash the precipitates. An aqueous solvent of pH of about 7, such as water or an aqueous alkali solution, is added to the precipitates, to neutralize and dissolve the precipitates. The resulting solution is spray-dried as desired, to give a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean<br><br>
protein in the form of powder. Here, as the above-mentioned acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, acetic acid, phytic acid or the like is used, and as the above-mentioned alkali, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like is used.<br>
By the procedures described above, the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans are collected in an amount of from 30 to 40% by weight as a protein. The protein content in the resulting Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein is usually 90% by weight or more, a part of which contains impurities. Here, it has been confirmed that the impurities do not include a guar gum component.<br>
As the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein, a commercially available product can be used if the product is available.<br>
Furthermore, for example, these Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean proteins which are appropriately degraded with an enzyme protease (manufactured by Novo Nordisk Bioindustry) or the like can be used, as long as the exhibition of the desired effects of the present invention can be obtained. The resulting degraded matters can be used alone or together with a product that has not undergone degradation.<br>
On the other hand, the degraded galactomannan is obtained by hydrolyzing any raw material containing galactomannan as a chief component by a known method to make the molecular weight low. Such raw material includes natural mucopolysaccharides such as guar gum, locust bean gum, tara gum, cassia gum, and sesbania gum. Especially, from the viewpoint of ease in preparation by hydrolysis, the raw material of the degraded galactomannan is preferably guar gum, locust bean gum and sesbania gum, and more preferably guar gum and locust bean gum. Each of these raw materials can be used alone or<br><br>
in a mixture of two or more kinds.<br>
Methods of hydrolysis include, but not particularly limited to, enzymolysis, acidolysis and the like. From the viewpoint that the molecular weight of the degraded products can be easily evenly sized, enzymolysis is preferable.<br>
The enzyme used for enzymolysis is particularly not limited, and may be commercially available products, those derived from natural products, or those obtained by known recombinant techniques, as long as the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing mannose straight chain. From the viewpoint of enhancing the degradation efficiency, the enzyme is preferably P-mannanase derived from a bacteria belonging to Aspergillus, Rhizopus or the like.<br>
The conditions for the enzymolysis of the above-mentioned raw materials cannot be described flatly because they vary depending on the enzyme used. Ordinary conditions include, for example, the conditions wherein a reaction is carried out at 10° to 80°C for about 1 to about 75 hours in the presence of the enzyme in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the raw material in a buffer suitable for the enzyme used.<br>
The conditions for acidolysis include, but not particularly limited to, for example, the conditions wherein a reaction is carried out at 90° to 100°C for 1 to 40 hours in any solvent having a pH of from 1 to 4.<br>
By the procedures described above, the desired degraded galactomannan can be obtained. The resulting degraded product can be used directly, or can be used after washed with water or the like as desired. Further, commercially available products can be used. The commercially available products include, for example, "SUNFIBER (trade name)" [manufactured by Taiyo Kagaku Co.,<br><br>
Ltd.], "Fiberon (trade name)" [manufactured by DAINIPPON PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.] and the like.<br>
The degraded galactomannan used in the present invention has an average molecular weight of preferably from 2000 to 100000, more preferably from 8000 to 50000, and even more preferably from 15000 to 25000, from the viewpoint of excellent exhibition of the desired effects and usefulness.<br>
The average molecular weight can be obtained, for example, by subjecting the degraded galactomannan to high-performance liquid chromatography [column manufactured by YMC Co., Ltd.: YMC-Pack Diol-120] using polyethylene glycols (molecular weights: 2000, 20000 and 100000) as molecular weight markers to obtain the molecular weight distribution, numerically expressing the molecular weight distribution by applying the molecular weight distribution to the calibration curve obtained by the molecular weight markers, and averaging the resulting values.<br>
From the same viewpoint as in the case of the average molecular weight, the degraded product in the form of an aqueous 0.5(w/v)% solution has a viscosity of preferably 50 mPa*s or less, more preferably 30 mPa*s or less, and even more preferably 10 mPa*s or less when determined with a B Type Viscometer at 25°C. Here, the determination with the B Type Viscometer described herein is usually carried out using a rotor No. 1, under the conditions of a rotational speed of 20 rpm.<br>
As the degraded galactomannan of the present invention, those falling within the above-mentioned preferable ranges for both the average molecular weight and the viscosity mentioned above are especially preferable.<br>
In addition, the composition of the present invention may contain other<br><br>
components as long as the exhibition of the desired effects of the present invention would not be inhibited. The components include, but not particularly limited to, for example, water, such as tap water, distilled water, and ion-exchanged water; proteins other than the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein; amino acids; peptides; dietary fibers; tea extracts such as polyphenols; and the like. Among them, dietary fiber is preferable.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein and a degraded galactomannan, or further comprises other components as desired as described above.

The method of ingesting those foods can be pursuant to the conventional methods applied to those foods.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will be explained in detail hereinbelow by means of the examples, without intending to limit the present invention thereto.<br>
Preparation Example 1-1<br>
A 0.1 N hydrochloric acid was added to 900 g of water, to adjust the pH to 4.5. The amount 0.2 g of -mannanase derived hom Aspergillus bacteria<br><br><br><br>
(manufactured by Novo Nordisk Bioindustry) and 100 g of guar gum powder (manufactured by Taiyo Kagaku Co., Ltd., medium-grade product) were added thereto, and the mixture was mixed, to carry out enzymolysis of guar gum at 40° to 45°C over a period of 24 hours. After the reaction, the mixture was heated at 90°C for 15 minutes, to deactivate the enzyme. The mixture was separated by filtration (suction fihration), to remove insoluble substances. The resulting transparent solution was concentrated under a reduced pressure (Yamato evaporator) (solid content: 20% by weight), and thereafter the concentrate was dried with a spray dryer [manufactured by Ohkawara Kakouki Co., Ltd.], to give 68 g of a degraded galactomannan (degraded galactomannan content: 85% by weight) in the form of powder. Here, the degraded galactomannan contained protein in an amount of 4.1% by weight.<br>
The viscosity of the resulting degraded galactomaiman was determined in the same manner as in Preparation Example 1-1. As a result, the viscosity was 3 mPa»s. In addition, the average molecular weight was obtained. As a result, the molecular weight was about 25000.<br>

'f* weight) in the form of powder. Here, the degraded galactomannan contained<br>
protein in an amount of 6,7% by weight.<br>
The viscosity was determined for the degraded galactomannan obtained in<br>
the same manner as in Preparation Example 1-1. As a result, the obtained<br>
viscosity was 9 mPa»s. In addition, the average molecular weight was obtained.<br>
As a result, the molecular weight was about 15000.<br>
Preparation Example 1-4<br>
In accordance with the description of Examples of the above-mentioned Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 5-117156 (page 4, line 3 to page 4, line 10), a hydrolyzed guar gum (degraded galactomannan) was prepared. The average molecular weight was determined in accordance with Preparation Example 1-1. As a result, the average molecular weight obtained was 5500. In addition, the viscosity was 8 mPa»s. The hydrolysate contained degraded galactomannan in an amount of 91% by weight, and the protein in an amount of 0.1% by weight.<br>
Preparation Example 1-5<br>
One-hundred grams of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus beans were appropriately pulverized in a food processor. The resulting pulverized beans were added to 1000 g of water, and the mixture was mixed. The soluble<br><br>
components were allowed to elute with keeping the mixture at room temperature for about 2 hours while stirring. Next, a dispersion of the pulverized product was subjected to centrifugation, to remove insoluble components as precipitates. Hydrochloric acid was added to the supernatant obtained, to adjust the pH to 4.5, and the protein was allowed to precipitate. The precipitates were further subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. Thereafter, washing was carried out by adding water to the remaining precipitates, to once disperse the precipitates, centrifuging the dispersion again and collecting the precipitates. Here, the procedures were repeated 3 times. The precipitates were dispersed in water, and the pH was then adjusted to 7 by adding sodium hydroxide thereto, to dissolve the precipitates by neutralization. Thereafter the resulting solution was spray-dried, to give 34 g of a Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein in the form of powder. The protein content was 91% by weight.<br>
Example 1-1<br>
The amount 4.5 g of the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Example 1-4 and 0.5 g of the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein of Preparation Example 1-5 were mixed, to give a composition for lowering a GI value. The weight ratio of the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein to the degraded galactomannan {Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein / degraded galactomannan) was 1 / 8.9.<br>
Example 1-2<br>
The composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 was blended in boiled rice, to make an onigiri (rice ball). The weight ratio of the carbohydrates<br><br>
in the rice ball to the composition (carbohydrates in the onigiri I composition) was 16/I.<br>
Comparative Examples 1-1 and 1-2<br>
The amount 4.5 g of the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Example 1-4 and 0.5 g of a milk protein (manufactured by Omu milk products co., ltd.) or a soy protein (manufactured by FUJI OIL CO., LTD.) were mixed, to give a comparative composition.<br>
Test Example 1-1<br>
The influence of foods on GI values was studied by asking subjects (20 healthy women: average age: 20, average weight: 57 kg) to ingest various test foods simultaneously together with any of the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Examples 1-1 to 1-4, the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein of Preparation Example 1-5 and the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 as a test substance.<br>
As the test food, boiled rice, bread, Japanese wheat noodle, pasta or orange was used. The amount of the food in one ingestion was set to be 50 g calculated as the amount of carbohydrates. The amount of each test substance in one ingestion was set to be 5 g for the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Examples 1-1 to 1-4, 0.5 g for the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein of Preparation Example 1-5, and 5 g for the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1, respectively. The test substance was dissolved in 200 mL of water, and the solution was ingested simultaneously with each food.<br>
Blood was taken from the subjects every 30 minutes until 2 hours after the<br><br>
ingestion of the test food and the test substance. The blood glucose level was determined with a glucose-test sensor (manufactured by Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho K.K.). Each subject was made to take 50 g of glucose, and the blood glucose level was then separately determined previously in the same manner. Blood glucose level curves for both cases were drawn on the bases of the found values. The area below the blood glucose level curve was obtained by calculating the area below the curve until 2 hours after the ingestion, and a Gl value was obtained according to the formula of the "GI value of food or feed" mentioned above.<br>
On the day of the test, the subjects took the test skipping breakfast. Each subject ingested one kind of food arbitrarily. The test was carried out on the different days for each of the different kinds of foods.<br>
The average of the GI values for each food in the case where a test substance was simultaneously ingested is shown in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, In each food, the GI value in the case where only the food was ingested without ingestion of the test substance is shown in the table as "without addition" as a comparative control.<br><br>

It can be seen from Tables 1-1 and 1-2 that each of the foods shows lowered GI value when the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Examples 1-1 to 1-4 and the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 are ingested at the same time with each food as compared to that of without addition, and that the effects of lowering of GI values are even higher especially when the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 containing both the degraded galactomannan and the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein is ingested. It can also be seen that the effect of lowering of a GI value cannot be accomplished only with the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein of Preparation Example 1-5.<br><br>
Test Example 1-2<br>
The influences on the GI values of foods were studied in accordance with Test Example 1-1 using any of the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 and the comparative compositions of Comparative Examples 1-1 and 1-2 as a test substance. The results are shown in Table 1-3.<br>

It can be seen from Table 1-3 that in the case of the comparative composition containing a milk protein or a soy protein and the degraded galactomannan of Preparation Example 1-4, the GI value is similar to that in the<br><br>
case where merely the degraded galactomannan and a food are simultaneously ingested (see Table 1-1), and that synergistic effects cannot be especially obtained by concomitant use of those proteins. On the other hand, in the case of the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1, a prominent effect of lowering of GI values is accomplished as compared to that of the case where the degraded galactomannan and a food are simultaneously ingested. It can be seen from the above that the effects of the composition for lowering a GI value of Example 1-1 are owing to the synergistic effects of the degraded galactomannan and the Cyamopsis tetragonolobus bean protein.<br>
Preparation Example 2-1   Preparation of a Polygalactose Derivative<br>
The amount 2000 kg of Larue leptolepis chips was soaked in cold water to carry out extraction for 1 hour, and the extract obtained was filtered, to remove insoluble substances. Subsequently, substances having low molecular weights were removed by ultrafiltration using a filter having a fractionation molecular weight of 10000, and thereafter dehydrated and dried, to give 153 kg of a polygalactose derivative in the form of white powder. The properties of the resulting polygalactose derivative were a viscosity of 11.5 mPa»s (in 30(w/v)%, at 25°C, as determined with B Type Viscometer), a pH of 5.2 (in l(w/v)%), and a dietary fiber content of 94.2% by weight. The resulting polygalactose derivative had a molecular weight distribution of from 12000 to 100000, an average molecular weight of 20000, and a galactose content in the total carbohydrates of 86.1% by moL. Furthermore, the structure was a straight-chain polygalactose in which a side chain has galactose and arabinose thereon, and the main chain binds via P-(l-*3) bond.<br><br>
Here, the viscosity of the resulting polygalactose derivative was determined with a B Type Viscometer using a rotor No. 1, under the conditions of 20 rpm. The pH was determined with a pH meter, and the dietary fiber content was determined in accordance with AOAC method.<br>
The molecular weight distribution and the average molecular weight were evaluated using size exclusion gel filtration method. Specifically, 10 mg of a polygalactose derivative was dissolved in 5.0 mL of a 0.1 N aqueous NaCL solution, and the solution was poured into a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.3 cm X l]jD cm) equilibrated with a 0.1 N aqueous NaCL solution. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/minute. The eluate was collected in an amount of 7.0 mL each, and the sugar in each fraction was separately detected by phenol-sulfuric acid method. The gel filtration column was examined using standard dextran of a known molecular weight, and an average molecular weight was obtained from a semi-logarithmic graph.<br>
The monosaccharide composition was assayed after acidolysis by HPAE-PAD method using a saccharide analysis system DXc-500 manufactured by Dionex Corporation. The detailed results were galactose 86.1% by moL, arabinose 12.2% by moL, glucose 0.2% by moL, and other carbohydrates 1.5% by moL. Conformational analysis of the polygalactose derivative was carried out by methylation analysis and NMR analysis.<br>

With 14 normal healthy subjects without smoking habit (average age: 46.7, men: 7 members, women: 7 members, average BMI: 25.2 kg/m, average fasting blood glucose: 5.3 mmoL/L), clinical trial was carried out for the effects on the postprandial glycemic index. The trial was carried out according to randomized cross-over design in which the subjects were asked to ingest a standard food, a control food or a test food. As the standard food, a single glucose solution containing 50 g of glucose (manufactured by Medic Diagnostic Laboratory, trade name: Medic Orange 50 Glucose Tolerance Test Beverage, glucose content: 50 g/each) was ingested as standard carbohydrates. As the control food, bread reported by Wolever et al. was ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving (see, for example, the above-mentioned K. Doi, et al. Eds., Shokumotsu Sen-i {Dietary Fiber)). As the test food, the inventive product 2-1, the inventive product 2-2, the inventive product 2-3, the inventive product 2-4, the comparative product 2-1, the comparative product 2-2, the comparative product 2-3, or the comparative product 2-4 was ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving. Here, 63 g of the inventive product 2-1, the inventive product 2-3, the comparative product 2-1 and the comparative product 2-3 correspond to 50 g of carbohydrates, and 203 g per serving of the inventive product 2-2, the inventive product 2-4, the comparative product 2-2 and the comparative product 2-4 correspond to 50 g of the amount of ingestion of carbohydrates.<br>
The subjects were asked to fast, starting from 12 hours before the day of the trial, and thereafter blood samples were taken. After taking the blood samples, the subjects were asked to ingest the control food or the test food, and blood samples were taken every 15 minutes until 2 hours after eating. The blood<br><br>
glucose level of the blood sample taken was determined, and the blood glucose level was recorded with passage of time.<br>
The area below the curve of blood glucose level until 2 hours after eating in the case where the standard food, the control food and the test food were ingested was obtained, to calculate the glycemic index on the basis of the standard food. Here, the glycemic index of the standard food was defined as 100. The average of the glycemic index of each subject is shown in Table 2-1 for each food.<br>

Test Example 2-2<br>
Clinical trial was carried out on the effect on the postprandial glycemic<br><br>
indexes with 16 patients with insulin-dependent diaoeies mellitus who neither have smoking habit nor are subjected to medication (average age: 48.9, men: 8 members, women: 8 members, average BMI: 26.6 kg/ m, average fasting blood glucose: 9.3 mmoL/L). The trial was carried out according to randomized cross-over design in which the subjects were asked to ingest a control food or a test food. As the control food, bread reported by Wolever et al. was ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving. As the test food, the inventive products 2-1 to 2-8 (the inventive product 1, the inventive product 2, the inventive product 3, the inventive product 4, the comparative product 1, the comparative product 2, the comparative product 3 or the comparative product 4) were ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving. Here, 63 g of the inventive product 2-1, the inventive product 2-3, the comparative product 2-1 and the comparative product 2-3 correspond to 50 g of carbohydrates, and 203 g per serving of the inventive product 2-2, the inventive product 2-4, the comparative product 2-2 and the comparative product 2-4 correspond to 50 g of the amount of ingestion of carbohydrates.<br>
The subjects were asked to fast, starting from 12 hours before the day of trial, and thereafter blood samples were taken. After taking the blood samples, the subjects were asked to ingest the test food, and blood samples were taken every 30 minutes until 3 hours after eating. The blood glucose level of the blood sample taken was determined, and the blood glucose level was recorded with the passage of time.<br>
The area below the curve of blood glucose level until 2 hours and 3 hours after eating in the case where the control food and the test food were ingested was obtained, to calculate the glycemic index on the basis of the control food.<br><br>

As shown in Table 3-1, the inventive products 3-1 to 3-4 showed low glycemic indexes of 70 or less as compared to those of the comparative products 3-1 to 3-4 and the control food.<br>
Test Example 3-2<br>
Clinical trial was carried out for the effect on postprandial glycemic indexes with 10 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who neither have smoking habits nor are subjected to medication (average age: 48.3, men: 5 members, women: 5 members, average BMI: 26.9 kg/ m , average fasting blood glucose: 9.1 mmoL/L). The test was carried out according to randomized cross-over design in which the subjects were asked to ingest a control food or a test food. As the control food, bread reported by Wolever et al. was ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving. As the test food, the inventive product 3-1, the inventive product 3-2, the inventive product 3-3, the inventive product 3-4, the comparative product 3-1, the comparative product<br><br>
3-2, the comparative product 3-3 and the comparative product 3-4 were ingested so as to contain carbohydrates in an amount of 50 g per serving. Here, 63 g of the inventive product 3-1, the inventive product 3-3, the comparative product 3-1 and the comparative product 3-3 correspond to 50 g of carbohydrates, and 203 g per serving of the inventive product 3-2, the inventive product 3-4, the comparative product 3-2 and the comparative product 3-4 correspond to 50 g of carbohydrates.<br>
The subjects were asked to fast, starting from 12 hours before the day of trial, and thereafter blood samples were taken. After taking the blood samples, the subjects were asked to ingest the control food or the test food, and blood samples were taken every 30 minutes until 3 hours after eating. The blood glucose level of the blood sample taken was determined, and the blood glucose level was recorded with passage of time.<br>
The area below the curve of blood glucose level until 3 hours after eating in the case where the control food and the test food were ingested was obtained, to calculate the glycemic index on the basis of the control food. Here, the glycemic index of the control food was defined as 100. The results are shown in Table 3-2.<br><br>
Table 3-2<br><br>
