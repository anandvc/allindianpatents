The compounds of formula 1 may contain asymmetric centers and thus they can exist as enantiomers. The present invention includes both mixtures and separate individua 1 isorners .<br>
Male erectile dysfunction is one of the most common sexual  dysfunctions  in  men.     Although  erectile dysfunction can be primarily psychogenic in origin, it often accompanies chronic illnesses,  such  as diabetes mel.lit.us, heart disease, hypertension, and a variety of<br>
neurological diseases. Its prevalence is strongly related to age, with a estimated prevalence of 2% at age 40 years rising to 25-30% by age of 65. Although no data are available on the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men aged over 75, it is probably over 50%.<br>
Varic:s treatment options for erectile dysfunction are availaole, such as -.-counseling, hormonal therapy, self-injection or transurethral application of vasc::ilatcr agents, vac-..urn devices, prosthesis implant aticn, and venous'arterial surgery. However, these therapeutic options have several limitations such as side effects, high-rest and low efficacy. Therefore<br>

Sildenafil is the first in a new class of ci r u a 5 -: n c: •-• n a s i n hi i b i ting phcsphodiesterase-5 e n z ym e distribute; specifically in corpus cavernosal tissues and indures relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle so that blood flow to the penis is enhanced,<br><br>
leading to an erection. Sildenafil has shown a response rate of around 80% in men with erectile dysfunction of organic cause.<br>
On the other hand, LISP 3,939,161 discloses that 1, 3-dimethyl-lff-pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives exhibit ant: iconvulsant and sedative activiity, and also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity and gastric antisecretory activity; EP 201,188 discloses that 5-substituted pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives have effects of antagonizing adenosine receptor and of inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes ard can be used for the treatment of cardiovascular disorder;: such as heart failure or cardiac insufficiency; E? 463,756, EP 526,004, WO 93/6,104 ana KG 93/7, 14:- disclose that p y i • a z o 1 o p y t' i m i d i n o n e d e r i v a t: i v e s w h i c i". i n h i b L t c - GM P phosphodiestera.se more selectively than c-AMP phosphodiesterase have efficacy on cardiovascular disorders such as angina pecioris, hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis, chronic asthma, etc.; and WO 94/28,902, WO 96/16,644, WO 94'16,657 ana WO 98/49,166 disclose that the known inhibitors of c-GMP phosphodiesterase including the pyrazolopyrimidinone<br><br>
derivatives of the above mentioned patents can be used for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction.<br>
We, the inventors of the present invention, have investigated to develop the improved therapeutic agent for impotence and synthesized new pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives which have better potency for the treatment of impotence than that of sildenafil, based on the mechanism of inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme.

In crder to confirm the efficacy on impotence of the compounds of formula 1, penile erection test was carried out with the normal rat moael based on the methods of Benassi-Benelli et al. (Arch. International de Pharmaco-dynamle et de Therapie., 1979, 242, 241-247), Islam et al. (J. Ethnopharmacol., 1991, 33, 67-72) and Heaton et al. (J. Urol., 1991, 145, 1099-1102).<br>
Pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives were suspended in<br>
0.5 % methyl cellulose and orally administered to rats with a single dose of 10 mg/kg/10ml. After the administration of the drug, the rats were continously observed in terms of the number of penile erections and the number of genital groomings for 2 hours and the penile erection index (PEI) was calculated. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was calculated using Duncan's multiple comparison by the customary statistics program, Sigma-StatR. More than three rats were assigned to each group. To the rats of the other two groups were adminstered only the equivalent amount of 0.5% methyl cellulose or 10 mg/kg of sildenafil.citrate, and served as negative and positive control group, respectively. The penile erection indices in rat model with pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of examples 1-70 are listed in the following table 2.<br>

In order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 5 activity, of the compounds of formula 1, the following test was carried out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme (PDE 5) was separated from human corpus cavernosal tissues. About 3 g of this tissue was homogenized with 12 ml of Hepes buffer (20 roM Hepes, 250 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.2) at 4 °C. The solution was filtered with double-layered gauze and centrifuged (100,000 xg) for 60 min at 4 °C. The<br><br>
supernatant was filtered with 0.2 urn filter paper and separated by HPLC (Mono Q anion exchange column) with concentration gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl to elute PDE isozymes. The enzyme activity was measured on the each column fraction by the following process to separate PDE 5 fraction and the inhibition for PDE 5 of the compounds of formula 1 was measured using the fraction.<br>
To 1.5 ml tube were added 100 ul of reaction mixture (15 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4} and the appropriate amount of PDE 5 fraction and PDE inhibitor and the mixture was mixed well. To this solution was added [3H]-cAMP or [3H]-cGMP (500 nM, 2 uCi^'ml), the mixture was reacted in the incubator of 30 "0 for about 1 hour and the reaction was quenched by nutting the tube into boiling water for about 45 seconds ::o 2 min. Then the tube was chilled in ice bath for about .:; rain. To this tube was added snake venom (1 mg/ml, 100 ul] or 5'-nucleotidase (0.1 unit/tube) and the mixture v;as reacted in incubator of 37 °C for 10 min and chilled in ice bath. 3 times volume of methanol to the resin was added to the anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad resin, AG1-X2, 200-400 mesh) which had been already washed with 0.5 N HC1, H20, 0.5 N NaOH, H2O, 0.5 N HC1 and H20 in order and<br><br>
adjusted to pH 5. Then 1 ml of the pretreated resin was dispensed into the each tube with vortexing. The mixture was left at 4 °C for 15 min with occasional vortexing and centrifuged (10,000 rpm) for about 5 min to sediment the resin. The supernatant (700 ul) was transferred to a liquid scintillation vial, and mixed with 10 ml of scintillation cocktail. After stabilizing the solution by leaving it overnight, the radioactivity of the tube was measured by El-counter. TABLE 3 (Figure Removed)<br><br>
As a result, it was demonstrated that the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of the present invention inhibit the phosphodiesterase-5 activity in a concentration of 0.1-50 ng/ml (ICso) and therefore show-prominent efficacy on the treatment of impotence in oral administration.<br><exper intent> Test for phosphodies terase-6 (PDE 6) activity<br>
The inhibitor for PDE 5 is known to additionally inhibit PDE 6 distributed in retina, isozyiae of PDE 5, and which causes visual disorders. Therefore in order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 6, of the compounds of formula 1, the following test was carried out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-t enzyme (PDE 6) was separated from the retina of bullfrogs. The retina was added to Ringer's solution (105 niM MaCl, 2.5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM Glucose, 5 mM NaHC03, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5-7.6) containing 6% Percoll and the solution was shaken. Then the cells were disrupted with syringe<br><br>
pressure   and   centrifug.ed    (about   10,000   rpm) instantaneously to remove the pigment, and the resulting fraction was used as PDE 6 fraction.<br>
10 ul of reaction mixture (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgClz, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5) was dispensed into each well of microplate, to which were added 10 ul of fraction of PDE 6 and 10 ul of PDE inhibitor and the solution was mixed well. 10 ul of trypsin (about 20-100 ug/ml) was added to the solution, the mixture v/as reacted in incubator of 4 °C for 1 hour to activate PDE 6 and the reaction was quenched by adding 1C ul of soybean trypsin inhibitor (6 times higher concentration to the trypsin used). To this mixture was added 1C ul of cyclic nucleotide (generally, 10 mM cGMP was added) and appropriate amount of snake venom or 5'-nucxeotidase, and the mixture? was reacted in incubator cf 3" °C for 20 min. The inorganic phosphate produced by this reaction v/as measured in absorbance at 700-750 r.m by adding 150 ul of molybdate solution (0.4 N H2SC&gt;4, 0.2% ammonium molybdate, 2% sodium dodesyl sulfate, 2% ascorbic acid) prepared immediately before.<br>
TABLE   4 (Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the results, since the 50% inhibition concentration (IC5o) for PDE 6 is higher than for phosphodiesterase-5 in some of the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives, the probability of visual disorders caused<br><br>
by the compounds of the present invention can be much reduced compared with sildenafil.<br><experixnent> Test for phosphodiesterase-3  (PDE 3) activity<br>
The inhibitor for PDE 5 may inhibit PDE 3 distributed in heart, isozyme of PDE 5, additionally, which may cause side effects in cardiovascular system. Therefore in order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE 3, of the compounds of formula 1, the following test was carried out.<br>
Phosphodiesterase-3 enzyme (PDE 3) was separated from platelets of a rabbit. About 60 ml of blood was collected from a puncture of the abdominal artery of a rabbit in heparinized syringes. Platelet-rich plasma was harvested by centrif ugation for 5 rnin at 450 Xg and further centrifuged for 15 min at 1,200 Xg to precipitate the platelets. The platelets were resuspended in homogenizing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4), homogenized at 4 °C and ultrasonicated (30 sec/ml). The homogenized solution was centrifuged (105,000 Xg) for 1 hr at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant in which PDE was dissolved. The supernatant was separated by<br><br>
DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (Whatman DE52 bead) by using eluent (50 mM Tris-HCl, 3.75 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.0) with concentration gradient of 0-1 M sodium acetate to elute PDE isozymes. The PDE activity was measured on the each column fraction by the following process to separate PDE 3 fraction and the inhibition for PDE 3 of the compounds of formula 1 was measured by using the fraction.<br>
To 1.5 ml tube containing 100 ul of reaction mixture (15 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) were added appropriate amount of PDE 3 fraction and PDE inhibitor and the solution was mixed well. After [3H]-cAMP or [3H]-cGMP (500 nM, 2 uCi/ml) was added, the mixture was reacted in incubator of 30 °C for about 1 hour and the reaction was quenched by putting the tube into boiling water for about 45 seconds to 2 min. The tube was chilled in ice bath for about 5 min. To this tube was added snake venom (1 mg/ml, 100 ul) or S'-nucleotidase (0.1 unit/tube) and the mixture was reacted in incubator of 37 °C for 10 min and chilled in ice bath. 3 times volume of methanol to the resin was added to the anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad resin, AG1-X2, 200-400 mesh) which had been already washed with 0.5 N<br><br>
HC1, H20, 0.5 N NaOH, H20, OiS N HC1 and H20 in order and adjusted to pH 5. Then 1 ml of the pretreated resin was added to the each tube with vortexing. The mixture was left at 4 °C for 15 min with occasional vortexing and centrifuged (10,000 rpm) for about 5 min to sediment the resin. The supernatant (700 ul) was transferred to a liquid scintillation vial, and mixed with 10 ml of scintillation cocktail. After stabilizing the mixture by leaving it overnight, the radioactivity of the tube was measured by d-counter. TABLE 5 (Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the results, since the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) for PDE 3 is higher than for PDE 5 in some of the pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives, the probability of side effects in cardiovascular system caused by the compounds of the present invention can be much reduced compared with sildenafil.<br><experiment> Acute oarl toxicity test in rats<br>
The test for confirming the toxicity of the compounds of formula 1 was carried out as follows.<br>
In this test six-week old SPF SD rats were used, and<br><br>
two rats were assigned to .each group. The compounds of examples I, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 19, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68 arid 70 were suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose respectively, and administered orally with single dose of 1 g/kg using a ball-tipped needle. The dosing volume was 10 ml/kg. After the administration, the animals were observed for clinical signs of toxicity or mortality and the body weight changes were measured. All survivors at the ena of the observation period underwent laparotomy under ether anesthesia and the blood samples 'were taken from the abdominal aorta for hematological tests and bi General coJ analysis. After sacrificing the animals, autopsy was performed for macroscopic observation of the organs and tissues. Tissue samples of vital organs from macroscopic legion were removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, then processed by standard procedures for histopathology and examined with light microscope. There were no significant clinical symptoms, body weight changes and mortalities. Also in hematology, serum chemistry parameters and macroscopic observation, no drug-related changes were observed. As a<br><br>
result all the compounds tested did not show toxicity in rats up to 1 g/kg, and the lethal dose (LD5o) of oral administration was determined to be over 1 g/kg in rats.<br><experiment> Solubility in buffer solution in pH=2&amp;5<br>
In order to evaluate the solubilities in water of the compounds of formula 1 in pH=2 and 5 buffer solutions, the experiment as below was performed.<br>
According to that defined in the Korea Pharmacopoeia, citrate-HCl buffer (pH 2) and citrate-NaOH buffer (pH 5) solutions were added to the powdered compounds of formula 1, respectively. After subsequent severe shaking for 30 sec every 5 min in 20 _ 5 °C for 30 min, the level of compounds in the filtrate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The results were shown in Table 6.<br>
TABLE 6 (Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the results, the solubilities in water of the compounds according to the present invention are very high. The solubilities in water at pH 2 and 5 of sildenafil were 1585 and 480 ug/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the solubilities in water of the compounds of the present invention, preferrably of exmaples 56, 58,<br><br>
60, 62 and 68, were 3722-5356 and 4923-14758 ug/ml at pH 2 and 5, respectively. That is, the solubilities in water of the compounds according to the present invention has been increased to maximum 3.3 and 30.7 times compared with those of sildenafil at pH 2 and 5, respectively.<br>
The solubility in water, in particular in acidic range of pH, of the compound is the very important factor determining the absorption of the compound in oral administration. Therefore, the better absorption of the compounds according to the present invention are expected in the light of the higer solubility of the compounds in acidic range,1 of pH. Also they have an advantage of reducing the dose in oral administration.<br><experinvent> Metabolism in rat liver<br>
In order to evaluate the extent of metabolism of the compounds of formula 1, the metabolism in rat liver was studied as below similar to the reported method (C. L. Litterist, E. G. Mimnaugh, R. I. Reagan and T. G. Gram., Drug. Metabol. Disposit., 1975, 3, 259-265). In short, the disappearance of compounds after incubation in 9,000 Xg supernatant: fraction of rat liver homogenate in the<br><br>
presence  of  NADPH   (reduced   nicotinamide   adenine dinucleotide phosphate) was evaluated.<br>
First, Sprague-Dawley rat (Korea Experiment Animals, SPF) liver was isolated after perfusion through portal vein with 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 using tissue homogenizer at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 9,000 Xg for 20 miri, the supernatants were collected.<br>
The compound stock .solution was spiked (10 ug/ml) into each of the eppendorf rubes containing 1 ml of the mixed solution composing 1 volume of supernatants and 2 volumes of generating solution. The generating solution contains 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 50 mM nicotinamide and 5 mM MgCl^ in 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0. After vortex-mi:; ing, each test tube was incubated in a water bath kect at 37 WC. After 1 hr, was added acetonitrile to the reaction mixture and centrif uged. 100 ul of aliquot of the supernatant was sampled from each test tube for measuring the remnants by high performance liquid chrcraatography. The results were shown in Table 7.<br>
TABLE 7 (Table Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the results, the extent of metabolism of the compounds in rat liver is noticeably decreased. The remnant (%) of some of the compounds in liver was over 50% while that of sildenafil in liver was about 35%. In particular, the remnant (%) of some of the compounds of the present invention was over 80% and 95% at maximum. That is, it was confirmed that some of the compounds of the present invention were hardly metabolized in liver.<br>
The level of metabolism of the compound in liver is another important factor determining the bioavailability and the in vivo effect, accompanied with the solubility in acidic conditions. The low remnant(%) requires the increase of the dose. Therefore the higher<br>
bioavailability and the better in vivo effect of the compounds of the present invention are expected in the light of the less metabolism in liver. Also the compounds of the present invention have an advantage of reducing the dose in oral administration.<br><br><br><br>
