1.	TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
METHOD AND DEVICE FOR OPTIMISING OPERATING PARAMETERS ON AN OPERATING POINT OF A TEXTILE MACHINE PRODUCING CROSS-WOUND SPOOLS<br>
2.	APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : SAURER GMBH &amp; CO., KG.<br>
b)	Nationality : GERMAN Company<br>
c)	Address     : LANDGRAFENSTRASSE 45,<br>
D-41069 MONCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
In the production of cross-wound spools at the working stations of textile machines, specific operating parameters constantly have to be adhered to in order to be able to produce high-quality cross-wound spools. These operating parameters depend, for example, on the material present and the desired yarn number and may be very different from yarn batch to yarn batch.<br>
Moreover, specific operating parameters depend on the type of textile machine. While specific spinning and winding parameters have to be adhered to in spinning machines, in automatic cross-winding machines, apart from winding parameters, splicing parameters also, above all, play an important part.<br>
The cross-wound spools produced on textile machines of this type, apart from a high spool weight, should have good run-off behaviour, a homogeneous spool build-up and, as far as possible, no defective points.<br>
This means, depending on the purpose of use of the cross-wound spool, for example during use as a dye spool, that the spool build-up plays a very important part, for example. Dye spools of this type should, for example, have a density which is as uniform as possible and in particular not be wound too hard.<br>
The thread wound to form a cross-wound spool should also as far as possible have no visible defective points. As cross-wound spools produced on automatic cross-winding machines, which, as is known, consist of a plurality of rewound spinning cops, always have a plurality of thread connection points, and thread connection points of this type represent unavoidable defective points, efforts are made to give these thread connection points an appearance of uniform thread as far as possible.<br>
It is already known in conjunction with textile machines, in particular of open end spinning machines, to have assistance in terms of advice in the adjustment of certain operating parameters from the control mechanism of the textile machine.<br>
2<br><br>
A method is described, for example, in EP 0 452 836 Bl for improving the spinning results of a rotor spinning machine with regard to the yarn properties of the spun yarn. In this known method, a knowledge memory is built up in a data processing system of a rotor spinning machine, in which characteristics are stored which relate to properties of textile end products, components of the raw material selection and data of the spinning device. The user enters a dialogue with a computer of the data processing system before the beginning of a production process. In other words, proposals for operating the spinning device are submitted by the computer with processing of the information input by the user and with access to the knowledge memory.<br>
DE 103 49 094 Al describes a similar method. In other words, in this published application, a method is described in which specific parameters can be input in an assisted mode, in which the user receives additional information on the required parameters, if necessary, from the input mechanism.<br>
In this known method, the possibility does not exist, however, for checking the parameter adjustments and optimising them.<br>
Furthermore, thread splicing devices, with which the thread ends produced when the yarn defects are cut out are reconnected, are known in conjunction with automatic cross-winding machines, in which during rewinding, the thread drawn off from the spinning cop is checked for possible yarn defects, for example from DE 102 02 781 Al or DE 102 24 081 Al. These known splicing devices, which operate pneumatically, provide thread connection points which are hardly visible with a correct, batch-specific adjustment. In other words, with these known thread splicing devices, thread connections can be achieved, which with regard to their quality (strength and appearance) come very close to the values of the regular thread. The strength and the appearance of such splicing devices are substantially determined by the adjustment and maintenance of splicing parameters adjusted precisely to the threads to be spliced.<br>
3<br><br>
Apart from these splicing parameters, which include, for example, the length of the overlapping of the thread ends in the splicing channel of the splicing device, the pressure and/or the duration of the splicing air blasted into the splicing channel and the shape of the splicing channel, good preparation of the thread ends in the so-called holding and opening tubes is also exceptionally important for a proper splicing connection.<br>
Finally it is also known, for example from the winding machine "Orion M-L" from Savio, to equip a central control unit of an automatic cross-winding rnachine, which is connected to the thread splicing devices of the working stations of the textile machine, with an operating board, at which specific yarn data can be input or at which a selection can be made between various items of splicer data. The types of<br>
splicers, the yarn material, the direction of the yarn rotation and the length of the overlapping of the thread ends in the splicing channel can be input at this known operating board. The central control unit of the textile machine then calculates, with the aid of this data, the splicing parameters, such as, for example, the preparation time of the thread ends in the holding and opening tubes or the duration of the splicing air pulse in the splicing channel.<br>
No check on the splicing parameters determined takes place in this known mechanism, either, so, correspondingly, if necessary, no proposals assisted by the central control unit can be submitted either to correct specific parameters.<br>
In other words, for example, an unsatisfactory thread splice owing to splicing parameters which are not optimal, on the one hand, will not be immediately recognised, and on the other hand, if the defective thread splice is ultimately discovered after all, no proposals will be submitted to the operating personnel with regard to a possible correction of the splicing parameters to optimise the defective thread connection.<br>
4<br><br>
Proceeding from the above-mentioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of developing a method and a device, which place the operator of a textile machine, for example an automatic cross-winding machine, in a position, in particular during a batch change, to determine within a short time the optimum operating parameters for the relevant yam batch from the present yam data and to check the operating parameters received before their use on the entire textile machine on corresponding comparison patterns.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a method as described in claim 1 or by a device according to claim 16.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The method according to the invention allows the operating personnel, in particular before the start of a new yarn batch, in a relatively simple manner, to determine the optimal operating parameters for the new yam batch by means of a control mechanism of the textile machine, guided by a computer, and to immediately check the correctness of the values determined.<br>
In other words, the operating personnel, for example of an automatic cross-winding machine, after the input of the known batch-specific yarn data, are guided by the control mechanism to the optimal operating parameters for the respective yam batch, which can be directly verified, in each case, with the aid of various comparison patterns. In practice, this means that a textile, physical pattern, for example a cross-wound spool, a prepared thread end or a finished thread splice, which was produced with the aid of operating parameters, which the control mechanism has determined from the input yarn data, can be directly compared with a desired pattern and with defective patterns deviating from the desired pattern, which are reproduced on the operating surface of the input mechanism of the control mechanism.<br>
5<br><br>
I<br><br>
As described in claim 2, when the textile, physical pattern set up does not correspond to the desired pattern specified by the control mechanism, but is more similar to one of the defective patterns, on the basis of the values corrected by the control mechanism, a further textile, physical pattern, for example a further yarn quantity, is set up.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the corrected values determined by the control mechanism are manually confirmed at the input mechanism of the control unit (claim 3). The control mechanism thereupon initiates the renewed production of a textile, physical pattern, which is in turn compared with the desired pattern or the defective patterns, which are specified by the control mechanism.<br>
Instead of a manual confirmation of the corrected value determined by the control mechanism, it may also be provided in an alternative configuration described in claim 4 that the production of a new textile, physical pattern is initiated, at least partially automatically, by the control mechanism. In other words, the control mechanism, taking into account the corrected value, immediately brings about the production of a new textile, physical pattern when the operating personnel negate a match of the present textile, physical pattern with the desired pattern and instead confirm the similarity of the present pattern with one of the defective patterns.<br>
As described in claim 5, the cycle of production of a textile, physical pattern after the input of a corrected value determined by the control mechanism and of the comparison of the pattern produced with a desired pattern specified by the control mechanism, and the defective pattern deviating from the desired pattern, is repeated until the textile, physical pattern corresponds to the desired pattern specified by the control mechanism.<br>
If it should turn out that an approximation of the textile, physical pattern to the desired pattern specified by the control mechanism is not to be achieved despite repeated correction of the relevant operating parameter, further operating<br>
6<br><br>
parameters are subjected one after the other to the cycle described above, as described in claim 6.<br>
As described in claim 7, cross-wound spools, prepared thread ends or finished thread splices, for example, are displayed on the operating surface of the input mechanism of a control mechanism in viewing fields, as optical comparison patterns and defective patterns.<br>
According to claim 8, the spool build-up of a cross-wound spool which is optimally wound according to the purpose of use, and the spool build-up of a cross-wound spool that has been wound too hard and the spool build-up of a cross-wound spool which has been wound too soft, are displayed, for example, in the viewing field of the control mechanism. The operator can recognise by a simple comparison of these patterns with the textile, physical pattern in front of him whether the adjusted operating parameter(s) is/are in order or whether a correction is necessary.<br>
As described in claim 9, the spool build-up is primarily to be influenced by the operating parameters of spool build-up pressure and thread tensile force. In particular an increase in the thread tensile force leads, in this case, to a cross-wound spool which is wound in a harder manner.<br>
The comparison patterns displayed in the viewing fields of the operating surface of the control mechanism can also, as described in claim 10, be prepared thread ends or finished thread splices, an operating result evaluated as good and, for comparison, a plurality of working results which can be improved, being also displayed here, in each case.<br>
As described in claim 11, the viewing fields also describe, for example, apart from an optimally prepared thread end, a thread end which has been excessively thinned, for example, owing to a preparation time which was too long or air pressure which was<br>
7<br><br>
too high, as well as a thread end, in which the thread twist is not yet sufficiently opened.<br>
Accordingly, a finished thread splice evaluated as good can also be shown in the viewing fields of the operating surface of the control mechanism as well as a thread splice, which, for example, because of too little overlapping of the thread ends in the splicing channel, has a thin point and a thread splice which, for example, is too thick owing to insufficient swirling or the like (claim 12).<br>
In the method according to the invention of the computer-controlled optimisation of operating parameters, it is important that the control mechanism receives as much yam data from a new yarn batch as possible. Further important yarn data, which<br>
influences the operating parameters, such as yam number and number of the yam rotation per metre, can therefore also be input at the input mechanism of the control mechanism, in addition to the data for the yam material and the direction of the yam rotation (claim 13).<br>
Apart from this pure yarn data, the input mechanism also provides the possibility of inputting data on the planned subsequent processing of the cross-wound spools (claim 14). In other words, the control unit can be informed via the input mechanism as to what is planned with the finished cross-wound spool, for example following the rewinding process; for example, whether the cross-wound spool to be produced is then to be dyed or whether use of the cross-wound spool is provided for in a weaving mill, knitting factory, hosiery factory and a doubling mill (claim 15).<br>
Depending on the purpose of use, the demands on the cross-wound spool differ. A cross-wound spool, which is to be used as a dye spool, should, for example, have a relatively loose structure, so it can be uniformly dyed.<br>
The device according to the invention described in claim 16 substantially comprises a control unit of the textile machine, which is connected to the thread handling and<br>
8<br><br>
treating devices of the numerous working stations. The control unit also has an input mechanism with an operating surface, via which various data relating to the yarn or the cross-wound spool can be input. Moreover, viewing fields for displaying optical comparison patterns are integrated into this operating surface.<br>
The structure and the function of the input mechanism are very user-friendly, in this case. In other words, the operating personnel are successively guided, in a computer-guided manner, to the optimal operating parameters.<br>
As described in claim 17, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that the central control unit of the textile machine is used as the control mechanism to input the operating parameters and/or the yarn data and to display the desired pattern and the comparison patterns. The use of hardware, which is already available, at the machine, allows the method according to the invention to be carried out economically. In other words, the central control unit only substantially needs to be equipped in terms of software.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a front view of an automatic cross-winding machine, which is equipped with a device for optimising operating parameters,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side view of a working station of an automatic cross-winding machine with a device for optimising operating parameters,<br>
Fig. 3 schematically shows the pneumatic thread splicing devices of an automatic cross-winding machine and a device for optimising the splicing parameters of these thread splicing devices,<br>
9<br><br>
Fig. 4 to 11 show the operating surface of the input mechanism of the central control mechanism in consecutive phases of the computer-guided determination of optimal splicing parameters.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a front view of a textile machine producing cross-wound spools characterised as a whole by the reference numeral 1, an automatic cross-winding machine in the embodiment This automatic cross-winding machine 1 has a large number of working stations, so-called winding heads 2 between its end frames 35,36.<br>
Small-volume spinning cops 3, which are produced on ring spinning machines which are upstream in the production process, are rewound at the winding heads 2 to form cross-wound spools 11, which have many times the yarn volume of the spinning cops 3. The finished cross-wound spools 11 are transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit, for example by means of a cross-wound spool changer 23, to a transporting mechanism 21 running behind the winding heads 2, which transports the cross-wound spools 11 to a spool loading station (not shown) or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
An automatic cross-winding machine 1 of this type also has a central control unit 37, which is connected, for example via a machine bus 40, both to the control devices 39 of the winding heads 2, the so-called winding head computers, and also to a control computer 38 of the service unit 23 serving the winding heads 2.<br>
As indicated purely schematically in Fig. 1, the winding heads 2 have various mechanisms, know per se, which are necessary for proper spool operation of winding heads of this type.<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows, in a side view, a winding head 2 of this type of a textile machine 1 producing cross-wound spools. The spinning cops 3 produced on a ring spinning machine (not shown) and having only relatively little yarn material, are<br>
10<br><br>
rewound to form large-volume cross-wound spools 11 on the working stations or winding heads 2, as known and therefore not described in more detail.<br>
Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type usually have a logistics mechanism in the form of a spool and tube transporting system 53. Spinning cops 3 or empty tubes revolve in this spool and empty tube transporting system 53, on transporting plates 58. Only the cop supply section 54, the reciprocatingly drivable memory section 55, one of the transverse transporting sections 56 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 57 are shown of this tube transporting system 53 in Fig. 2. As indicated, the spinning cops 3 delivered are in this case firstly positioned and rewound in an unwinding position 27, which is located in the region of the transverse transporting sections 56 at the winding heads 2.<br>
The individual working stations 2 for this purpose have, as known per se and therefore only indicated, various thread handling and thread treating mechanisms, which not only ensure that the spinning cops 3 can be rewound to form large-volume cross-wound spools 11, but which also ensure that the thread 50 is monitored during the rewinding process and thread defects detected are cleared.<br>
One of these mechanisms known per se is the winding device, which is designated as a whole with the reference numeral 64, and which, in each case, has a creel 68, which is movably mounted about a pivot pin 69, a spool drive mechanism 76 and a thread traversing mechanism 78.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, the cross-wound spool 11, during the winding process, for example, rests with its surface on a drive drum 76 and is entrained thereby via frictional engagement The drive drum 76 is driven, in this case, as known per se, via a speed-controllable, reciprocating drive mechanism (not shown). The traversing of the thread 50 when running onto the cross-wound spool 11 takes place by means of a thread traversing mechanism 78, which, in the present<br>
11<br><br>
embodiment, has a finger thread guide 79. Thread traversing mechanisms of this type are known and described in detail in DE108 58 548 Al, for example.<br>
The working stations 2 also have, in each case, a thread connection mechanism 10, preferably a pneumatically operating splicing mechanism, a suction tube 62 which can be acted upon by a vacuum and a gripper tube 65 which can also be acted upon by a vacuum.<br>
The suction tube 62 and the gripper tube 65 are connected in this case to the vacuum cross beam 72, which is in turn connected to a vacuum source 73.<br>
The working stations 2 generally also have a lower thread sensor 52, a thread tensioning mechanism 60, a thread clearer 46 with a thread cutting mechanism 47, a thread tensile force sensor 51 and a waxing mechanism 49.<br>
Fig. 3 schematically shows a wiring plan to the electronic or pneumatic control of the thread splicing devices 10 arranged in each case in the region of the winding heads 2 of the automatic cross-winding machine 1.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 2, each of the numerous winding heads 2 of the automatic cross-winding machine 1 has its own thread splicing device 10. Thread splicing devices 10 of this type, which are used in practice to produce the thread connections which become necessary in the course of a winding process, are known per se and described in relative detail in DE 102 24 081 A or in DE 102 02 781 Al. Thread splicing devices 10 of this type in each case have pneumatically loadable holding or opening tubes 12 for the preparation of the thread ends for the splicing process and a splicing prism 30, which can also be loaded pneumatically, with a splicing channel 26. The holding and opening tubes 12 of the individual winding heads 2 are in each case connected via a branch line 4, into which an electromagnetic valve 5 which can be activated in a<br>
defined manner via the central control unit 37 or the winding head computer 39, to a<br>
12<br><br>
joint compressed air distributor line 6, which is in turn connected via a pressure controller 7 and a pneumatic line 8 to a compressed air source 9.<br>
The splicing prisms 30 of the individual thread splicing devices 10 are connected in each case via corresponding branch lines 13, into which an electromagnetic valve 14 which can be activated in a defined manner via the central control unit 37 or the winding head computer 39, is also connected, in each case, to a further compressed air distributor line 15. The compressed air line distributor line 15 also has a pressure controller 16 on the input side, which is connected via a pneumatic line 17 to the compressed air source 9.<br>
The individual winding heads 2 also have, as already mentioned above, in each case, a winding head computer 39, which is connected, for example, via a bus line 40 to a central control unit 37 of the textile machine 1, and via control lines 22 or 24 to the electromagnetic valves 5 or 14 of the thread splicing device 10. As indicated in Fig. 2, the central control unit 37 has an input mechanism 18A, via which the yarn data of a new yarn batch can be input.<br>
Figs. 4 to 11 show the different operating surfaces 18 of the input mechanism 18A, as are produced in determining the splicing parameters. As can be seen, the operating surfaces 18 in each case have various icons, which, as known, can be selected by a cursor.<br>
The operating surface 18 shown in Fig. 3 shows a selection field 19, in which a plurality of conventional yarn materials are displayed, which can be selected, in each case by tapping the corresponding icon. Furthermore, this operating surface 18 has icons 20,28,29, at which the direction of the yarn rotation, the yarn number and the number of yarn rotations per metre of the present yarn can be input.<br>
The operating surface 18 can be left in a higher or lower plane via the icons 25, or data input by mistake can be deleted again.<br>
13<br><br>
The operating surface 18 with icons 31 is shown in Fig. 5. The icons 31 relate to the further processing of the cross-wound spool 11 provided in a subsequent processing operation. A distinction can be made at these icons, for example, between dying, weaving, knitting and twisting. In addition, the operating surface 18, like all operating surfaces, has the above-described icons 25.<br>
The operating surface 18 according to Fig. 6 has an icon 42 for adjusting the pressure level of the air blast in the opening tubes and an icon 43 for setting a splice code.<br>
An operating field 18 with viewing fields 32,33, 34 and icons 41 is shown in Fig. 7. The viewing field 32, in this case, shows an optimally prepared thread end, the so-called desired pattern of the central control unit 37. The viewing fields 33, 34 show corresponding defective patterns. In other words, an example of a thread end opened too much is shown in the viewing field 33 while the viewing field 34 shows a thread end, which is still not adequately freed from its yarn rotation. The optical comparison pattern, which is closest to a textile, physical comparison pattern which was previously set up on the thread splicing device 10, can be tapped, in each case, via the icons 41.<br>
Fig. 8<br>
In order to avoid, in the processing of a yarn batch, splicing parameters being used which are based on a textile, physical comparison pattern, which purely by chance corresponds to the specified desired pattern, the production of the textile, physical comparison pattern is repeated ten times. This text series is started via the icon 44. The start of a test series of this type can be prevented or a test series can be stopped via the icon 45.<br>
The operating surface 18 according to Fig. 9 corresponds to the operating surface according to Fig. 6. The desired splicing code can be entered or a splicing code proposed by the central control unit can be confirmed via the icon 43.<br>
14<br><br>
The result of the splicing process can be checked by means of the operating surface shown in Fig. 10. The viewing field 32 also shows an optimal thread splice here, in other words, the so-called desired pattern of the central control unit 37. The viewing fields 33, 34 show corresponding defective patterns. The viewing field 33, for example, shows a thread splice, which is too thin owing to inadequate overlapping of the thread ends in the splicing channel, while the viewing held 34, for example, shows an inadequately swirled thread splice.<br>
As in the preparation of the thread ends, the optical comparison pattern, which is closest to the textile, physical comparison pattern, which was set up previously on the thread splicing device 10, can also be tapped here via the icons 41, in each case.<br>
As described above in connection with the preparation of the thread ends, the production of the textile, physical comparison pattern is also repeated ten times here in order to avoid splicing parameters being used in the processing of a yarn batch, which are based on a textile, physical comparison pattern, which by chance matches the desired pattern proposed by the central control unit. This test series is also started via the icon 44 and optionally stopped via the icon 45.<br>
Functioning of the method according to the invention or the associated mechanism:<br>
Prior to the start of a new yarn batch, the optimal splicing parameters are firstly determined at one of the numerous winding heads 2 of the automatic cross-winding machine 1. For this purpose, the operating surface 18 shown in Fig. 3 is initially selected at the input mechanism 18A of the central control unit 37 and the present yarn material, the direction of the yarn rotation, the yarn number and the number of yam rotations per metre are entered via the icons 19,20, 28 and 29. By actuating the "N" icon 25, a change is then made to the next operating surface 18 shown in Fig. 4, at which the intended, next processing operation of the cross-wound spools 11 to be produced can be entered via the icons 31.<br>
15<br><br>
From this data, the central control unit 37 firstly calculates an advantageous pressure level for the opening air in the holding and opening tubes 12 and submits a corresponding proposal.<br>
In other words, a proposal for adjusting the pressure of the opening air is displayed at the icon 42 and can be confirmed there or changed. The splicer code at the icon 43 in this case remains at 000.<br>
Textile, physical comparison patterns in the form of prepared thread ends are then set up in the holding and opening tubes 12 of the relevant pilot winding head and, as shown in Fig. 6, are compared with the comparison patterns of the central control unit 37 shown in the viewing fields 32,33,34 of the operating surface 18. Depending on the result and actuation of the corresponding icons 41, a correction value is optionally worked out by the central control unit 37 and the production of a textile, physical comparison pattern repeated with this correction value. This process is continued until the textile, physical comparison pattern corresponds to the desired pattern 32 of the central control unit 37.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 7, the data determined is then checked by producing ten further comparison patterns. For this purpose, the icon 44 is selected on the operating surface 18.<br>
The splicing code is then set via the operating surface 18 of Fig. 8 at the icon 43 or a splicing code proposed by the central control unit 37 is confirmed.<br>
In a similar manner to in the setting up of optimally prepared thread ends, a textile, physical comparison pattern in the form of a thread splice is then set up in the thread splicing device 10 of the relevant pilot winding head. This thread splice is, as shown in Fig. 9, compared with the comparison patterns of the central control unit 37 shown in the viewing fields 32,33,34 of the operating surface 18. Depending on the result, the icon 41 associated with the corresponding viewing field is then actuated<br>
16<br><br>
and a correction value for the splicing code is then optionally worked out by the central control unit 37. The production of a textile, physical comparison pattern is then repeated with this correction value until the comparison pattern corresponds to the desired pattern 32 of the central control unit 37.<br>
The splicing code finally determined is also checked here by actuating the icon 44 and therefore the production of ten further comparison patterns.<br>
In conclusion, the determined and verified splicing code is transferred to the remaining working stations of the textile machine and the new yarn batch is started.<br>
17<br><br>
