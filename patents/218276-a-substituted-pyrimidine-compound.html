				<td>The present invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, a process for their preparation,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing them, a process for preparing the pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in therapy.<br>
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis consists of ligands, receptors, binding proteins' and proteases. The two ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II, are mitogenic peptides that signal through interaction with the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), a hetero-tetrameric cell surface receptor. Binding of either ligand stimulates activation of a tyrosine kinase domain in the intracellular region of the p-chain and results in phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues resulting in the recruitment and activation of various signaling molecules. The intracellular domain has been shown to transmit signals for mitogenesis, survival, transformation, and differentiation in cells. The structure and function of the IGF-1R has been reviewed by Adams et al {Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, 57, 1050-1093, 2000). The IGF-IIR (also known as mannose 6-phosphate receptor) has no such kinase domain and does not signal mitogenesis bur may act to regulate ligand availability at the cell surface, counteracting the effect of the IGF-1R. The IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) control availability of circulating IGF and release of IGF from these can be mediated by proteolytic cleavage. These other components of the IGF axis have been reviewed by Collett-Solberg and Cohen {Endocrine, 12, 121-136, 2000).<br>
There is considerable evidence linking IGF signaling with cellular transformation and the onset and progression of tumours. IGF has been identified as the major survival factor that protects from oncogene induced cell death (Harrington et al, EMBO J, 13, 3286-3295, 1994). Cells lacking IGF-1R have been shown to be refractory to transformation by several different oncogenes (including SV40T antigen and ras) that efficiently transform corresponding wild-type cells (Sell et al, Mol. Cell Biol., 14, 3604-12,1994). Upregulaiion of components of the IGF axis has been described in various tumour cell lines and tissues, particularly tumours of the breast (Surmacz, Journal of Mammary Gland Biology &amp; Neoplasia, 5, 95-105, 2000), prostate (Djavan et al, World J. Urol., 19, 225-233, 2001, and O'Brien et al, Urology, 58, 1-7, 2001) and colon (Guo et al, Gastroenterology, 102, 1101-1108, 1992). Conversely, IGF-IIR has been implicated as a tumour suppressor and is deleted in some cancers (DaCosta et al, Journal of Mammary Gland Biology &amp; Neoplasia, 5, 85-94, 2000). There is a growing number of epidemiological studies linking increased circulating IGF (or increased ratio of<br>
IGF-1 to IGFBP3) with cancer risk (Yu and Rohan, J. NatlCancer Inst. , 92, 1472-1489, 2000). Transgenic mouse models also implicate IGF signaling in the onset of tumour cell proliferation (Lamm and Christofori, Cancer Res. 58, 801-807, 1998, Foster et al, Cancer Metas. Rev., 17, 317-324, 1998, and DiGiovanni et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 91, 3455-3460, 2000).<br>
Several in vitro and in vivo strategies have provided the proof of principal that inhibition of IGF-1 R signaling reverses the transformed phenotype and inhibits tumour cell growth. These include neutralizing antibodies (Kalebic et al Cancer Res., 54, 5531-5534, 1994), antisense oligonucleotides (Resnicoff et al, Cancer Res., 54, 2218-2222, 1994), triple-helix forming oligonucleotides (Rinninsland et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 94, 5854-5859, 1997), antisense mRNA (Nakamura et al, Cancer Res., 60, 760-765, 2000) and dominant negative receptors (D'Ambrosio et al., Cancer Res., 56, 4013-4020, 1996). Antisense oligonucleotides have shown that inhibition of IGF-1 R expression results in induction of apoptosis in cells in vivo (Resnicoff et al, Cancer Res., 55, 2463-2469, 1995) and have been taken into man (Resnicoff et al, Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res., 40 Abs 4816, 1999). However, none of these approaches is particularly attractive for the treatmenl of major solid tumour disease.<br>
Since increased IGF signaling is implicated in the growth and survival of tumour cells, and bloking IGF-1R function can reverse this, inhibition of the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase domain is an appropriate therapy by which to treat cancer. In vitro and in vivo studies with the use of dominant-negative 1GF-1R variants support this. In particular, a point mutation in the ATP binding site which blocks receptor tyrosine kinase activity has proved effective in preventing tumour cell growth (Kulik et al, Mol. Cell. Biol., 17, 1595-1606, 1997). Several pieces of evidence imply that normal cells are less susceptible to apoptosis caused by inhibition of IGF signaling, indicating that a therapeutic margin is possible with such treatment (Baserga, Trends BiotechnoL, 14, 150-2,1996).<br>
There are few reports of selective IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Parrizas et al. described tyrphostins that had some efficacy in vitro and in vivo (Parrizas et al, Endocrinology, 138:1427-33 (1997)). These compounds were of modest potency and selectivity over the insulin receptor. Telik Inc. have described heteroaryl-aryl ureas which have selectivity over insulin receptors but potency against tumour cells in vitro is still modest (Published PCT Patent Application No. WO 00/35455).<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I):<br>

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenie acid; binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl p-hydroxybenz.oate, and anti-oxidants, such as<br>
ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonale, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcelluiose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxethylene stearate), or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl p_-hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), colouring agents, flavouring agents, and/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting<br>
agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, an esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and condensation products of the said partial esters wi;h ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavouring and preservative agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent, preservative, flavouring and/or colouring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. A sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example a solution in 1,3-butanediol.<br>
Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient with a conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedure well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for administration by insufflation may be in the form of a finely divided powder containing particles of average diameter of, for example, 30u. or much less, the powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is then conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50mg of active ingredient for<br>
use with a turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known agent sodium cromoglycate.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional pressurised aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>

The size of the dose for therapeutic purposes of a compound of the invention will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.<br>
In general, a compound of the invention will be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, from 0.5 mg to 75 mg active ingredient per kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, from 0.5 mg to 30 mg active ingredient per kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, from 0.5 mg to 25 mg active ingredient per kg body weight will generally be used. Oral administration is however preferred. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 2 g of active ingredient.<br>

A DNA molecule encoding a fusion protein containing glutathione-S-transferase (GST), thrombin cleavage site and IGF-1R intracellular domain (amino-acids 930-1367) and<br>
subsequently referred to as GST-IGFR, was constructed and cloned into pFastBacl (Life Technologies Ltd, UK) using standard molecular biology techniques (Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition 1989; Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis; Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press).<br>
Production of recombinant virus was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the pFastBac-1 vector containing GST-ldFR was transformed into E. coli DHlOBac cells containing the baculovirus genome (bacmid DNA) and via a transposition event in the cells, a region of the pFastBac vector containing gentamycin resistance gene and the GST-IGFR expression cassette including the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter was transposed directly into the bacmid DNA. By selection on gentamycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and X-gal, resultant white colonies should contain recombinant bacmid DNA encoding GST-IGFR. Bacmid DNA was extracted from a small scale culture of several BHlOBac white colonies and transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells grown in TCI00 medium (Life Technologies Ltd, UK) containing 10% serum using CellFECTIN reagent (Life Technologies Ltd, UK) following the manufacturer's instructions. Virus particles were harvested by collecting cell culture medium 72 hrs post transfection. 0.5 mis of medium was used to infect 100 ml suspension culture of Sf21s containing 1 x 107 cells/ml. Cell culture medium was harvested 48 hrs post infection and virus titre determined using a standard plaque assay procedure. Virus stocks were used to infect Sf9 and "High 5" cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 to ascertain expression of recombinant GST-IGFR .<br>
The GST-IGFR protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Glutathione-Sepharose followed by elution with glutathione. Briefly, cells were lysed in 50mM HEPES pH 7.5 (Sigma, H3375), 200mM NaCl (Sigma, S7653), Complete Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 1 873 580) and ImM DTT (Sigma, D9779), hereinafter referred to as lysis buffer. Clarified lysate supernatant was loaded through a chromatography column packed with Glutathione Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd.). Contaminants were washed from the matrix with lysis buffer until the UV absorbance at 280nm returned to the baseline. Elution was carried out with lysis buffer containing 20mM reduced glutathione (Sigma, D2804) and fractions containing the GST fusion protein were pooled and dialysed into a glycerol-containing buffer comprising 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 3 mM reduced glutathione and 1 mM DTT. b) Kinase activity assay<br>

The compounds of the Examples were found to have an IC50 in the above test of less than 50µM. Mechanism of Action Assay<br>
Inhibition of IGF-IR mediated signal transduction was determined by measuring changes in phosphorylation of IGF-IR, Akt and MAPK (ERK1 and 2) in response to IGF-I stimulation of MCF-7 cells (ATCC No. HTB-22). A measure of selectivity was provided by the effect on MAPK phosphorylation in response to EGF in the same cell line. a.i) Reagents used:<br>

MCF-7 cells were plated out in a 24 well plate at lxl05 cells/well in 1ml complete growth medium. The plate was incubated for 24 hours to allow the cells to settle. The medium was removed and the plate was washed gently 3 times with PBS 2ml/well. 1ml of starvation medium was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 24 hours to serum starve the cells.<br>
Then 25U.I of each compound dilution was added and the cells and compound were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. After 30 minutes incubation of the compound, 25U.1 of IGF (for 20ng/ml final concentration) or EGF (for 0.1 ng/ml final concentration) was added to each well as appropriate and the cells incubated with the IGF or EGF for 5 minutes at 37°C. The medium was removed (by pipetting) and then 100µ1 of 2x Laemmli buffer was added. The plates were stored at 4°C until the cells were harvested. (Harvesting should occur within 2 hours following addition of Laemmli buffer to the cells.)<br>
To harvest the cells, a pipette was used to repeatedly draw up and expel the Laemmli buffer/cell mix and transfer into a 1.5m! Eppendorf tube. The harvested cell Iysates were kept at -20°C until required. The protein concentration of each lysate could be determined using<br>
the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA, according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions).<br>
Western blot technique<br>
Cell samples were made up with 4x sample buffer, syringed with a 21 gauge needle and boiled for 5 minutes. Samples were loaded at equal volumes and a molecular weight ladder on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen BV, The Netherlands) and the gels were run in an Xcell SureLock™ Mini-Cell apparatus (Invitrogen) with the solutions provided and according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gels were blotted onto Hybond C Extra     membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK Ltd.) for 1 hour at 30 volts in the Xcell SureLock™ Mini-Cell apparatus, using Western transfer buffer. The blotted membranes were stained with 0.1% Ponceau S to visualise transferred proteins and then cut into strips horizontally for multiple antibody incubations according to the molecular weight standards. Separate strips were used for detection of IGF-1R, Akt, MAPK and actin control.<br>
The membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in PBST + 5% milk solution. The membranes were then placed into 3ml primary antibody solution in 4 well plates and the plates were incubated overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed in 5ml PBST, 3 times for 5 minutes each wash. The HRP-conjugated secondary antibody solution was prepared and 5ml was added per membrane. The membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. The membranes were washed in 5ml PBST, 3 times for 5 minutes each wash. The ECL solution (SuperSignal ECL, Pierce, Perbio Science UK Ltd) was prepared and incubated with the membranes for 1 minute (according to manufacturer's instructions), followed by exposure to light sensitive film and,development.<br>
