				<td>This disclosure relates generally to fluid ejecting devices, and more<br>
particularly to a flexible interconnect circuit for a fluid ejecting device.<br>
An ink jet printer forms a printed image by printing a pattern of individual<br>
dots at particular locations of an array defined for the printing medium. The<br>
locations are conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear array.<br>
The locations are sometimes called "dot locations," "dot positions," or "pixels".<br>
Thus, the printing operation can be viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot<br>
locations with dots of ink.<br>
Ink jet printers print dots by ejecting very small drops of ink onto the print<br>
medium, and typically include a movable print carriage that supports one or<br>
more print cartridges each having ink ejecting nozzles. The print carriage<br>
traverses back and forth over the surface of the print medium, and the nozzles<br>
are controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate times pursuant to command of<br>
a microcomputer or other controller, wherein the timing of the application of the<br>
ink drops is intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels of the image being<br>
printed. Typically, a plurality of rows of pixels are printed in each traverse or<br>
scan of the print carriage. The particular ink ejection mechanism within the<br>
printhead may take on a variety of different forms known to those skilled in the<br>
art, such as those using thermal printhead or piezoelectric technology. For<br>
instance, two earlier thermal ink jet ejection mechanisms are shown in<br>
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,278,584 and 4,683,481. In a thermal<br>
system, an ink barrier layer containing ink channels and ink vaporization<br>
chamber disposed between a nozzle orifice plate and a thin flim substrate.<br>
The thin film substrate typically includes arrays of heater elements such as thin<br>
flim resistors which are selectively energized to heat ink within the vaporization<br>
chambers. Upon heating, an ink droplet is ejectedfroma nozzle associated<br>
with the energized heater element By selectively energizing heater elements<br>
as the printhead moves across the print medium, ink drops are ejected onto the<br>
print medium in a pattern to form the desired image.<br>
Certain ink jet printers employ disposable print cartridges that are<br>
replaced when empty, and a consideration with such print cartridges that are<br>
reliable electrical interface between a print cartridge and the printer in which it is<br>
installed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
In the following detailed description and in the several figures of the<br>
drawing, like elements are identified with like reference numerals.<br>
[25] Referring now to FIG. 1, schematically depicted therein is an ink jet<br>
printer 114 partially cut away and with its front loading door removed. The<br>
printer includes a case or housing 115 and carriage drive motor 116 mounted<br>
on a chassis. The motor drives a belt 118 back and forth as the drive motor<br>
reverses direction. The drive belt 118 is attached to a print carriage 119 that<br>
scans laterally back and forth along a carriage scan axis CA from left to right<br>
and right to left. The print carriage 119 contains one or more externally similar<br>
thermal ink jet print cartridges 11 located side by side. For example, one print<br>
cartridge contains black ink while another has three ink chambers containing<br>
magenta, yellow and cyan inks. The horizontal scanning motion of the print<br>
carriage 119 is guided by a slider rod 121. Located in the rear of the carriage<br>
119 is an encoder, not shown, that reads a position encoder strip 122 and<br>
provides information of the location of the print carnage 119 along the carriage<br>
axis CA.<br>
The print carnage 119 includes a cartridge latching system that<br>
consistently and accurately positions the print cartridges 11 relative to an<br>
orthogonal coordinate system shown in FIGS. 2 and 10. The X axis is parallel<br>
to the carriage scan axis. The Y axis is parallel to and opposite a paper<br>
advance path which for example extends horizontally out of the printer 114,<br>
such that the X and Y axes define a horizontal plane. The Z axis extends<br>
vertically, orthogonal to the XY plane.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, the print cartridge 11 more particularly<br>
includes a print cartridge body comprised of a rear wall 24, a left side wall 25, a<br>
right side wall 26, a front wall 27, and a bottom wall 28 that includes a snout<br>
section 28a that supports an ink jet printhead 15. A top wall or lid 31 is attached<br>
to the upper edges of the front, side, and rear walls, and includes margins or lips<br>
29 that extend beyond the front and side walls. A latch catch or feature 50 is<br>
disposed-on the lid 31 close to the top boundary of the rear wall 24. The latch<br>
feature 50 extends upwardly from the top wall 31 and includes a front latch<br>
surface 50a and a rearwardly extending surface 50c that intersects the top of<br>
the front latch surface 50 at an edge surface 50b. By way of illustrative<br>
example, the front latch surface 50a is perpendicular to the lid 31 while the<br>
rearwardly extending surface 50c is a ramped surface that extends downwardly<br>
and rearwardly from the top of the front latch surface 50a. Alternatively, the<br>
rearwardly extending surface of the latch feature can comprise a horizontal<br>
surface 50c' as illustrated in FIG. 3. As described further herein, a latch pushes<br>
on a top portion of the latch feature 50. Depending upon implementation that<br>
top portion is the edge surface 50b or the horizontal surface 50c*.<br>
Located in the vicinity of the intersection of the left side wall 25, rear wall<br>
24 and snout 28a are a printhead cartridge X axis datum PX1, a first printhead<br>
cartridge Y axis datum PY1, and a first printhead cartridge Z axis datum PZ1.<br>
Located in the vicinity of the intersection of the right side wall 26, rear wall 24<br>
and snout 28a are a second printhead cartridge Y axis datum PY2 and a<br>
second printhead cartridge Z axis datum PZ2. A third printhead cartridge Y axis<br>
datum PY3 is located in the upper portion of the rear wall 24. The print cartridge<br>
Y axis datums generally comprise lands that are configured to be generally<br>
orthogonal to the Y axis when the cartridge is installed in the print carriage 40.<br>
The print cartridge Z axis datums comprise lands that are configured to be<br>
generally orthogonal to the Z axis when the print cartridge is installed in the print<br>
carriage 119. The print cartridge X axis datum comprises a land that is<br>
configured to be generally orthogonal to the X axis when the print cartridge is<br>
installed in the print carriage 119. As described further herein, the datums of<br>
the cartridge engage corresponding datums in the carriage.<br>
Disposed on the rear wall 24 and on the snout section 28a of the bottom<br>
wall 28 is a flexible circuit 33 that wraps around the intersection of such walls<br>
and provides electrical interconnection between the printer and the printhead<br>
15.<br>
[30] FIG. 5 is a schematic depiction of an implementation of the flexible circuit<br>
33 which includes an array 70 of contact areas 71 that are contactively<br>
engageable from the near side of the flexible circuit 33 which is the side that is<br>
away from the cartridge body. The side of the flexible circuit 33 that is against<br>
the cartridge body is called the far side. The contact areas 71 are disposed on<br>
a portion of the flexible circuit 33 that is located on the rear wall 24, and<br>
comprise electrically conductive areas that are contactively engageable with<br>
corresponding contact bumps 139 on a resilient contact circuit 137 (FIG. 13)<br>
located in the print carriage 119 (FIG. 1). By way of illustrative example, the<br>
flexible circuit is formed of a flexible substrate such as potyimide having a<br>
conductive pattern formed on the far side thereof and openings formed in the<br>
substrate so that portions of the conductive pattern can be contacted from the<br>
near side of the flexible circuit. In such implementation, the contact areas 71<br>
comprise conductive areas exposed by openings in the flexible substrate. The<br>
contact areas 71 can be circular, octagonal, square, square with rounded or<br>
beveled corners, or some other shape.<br>
The contact areas 71 are more particularly arranged in a plurality of side<br>
by side, transversely separated columnar arrays 73 of contact areas 71. Each<br>
columnar array 73 includes a lower contact area that is closest to the bottom<br>
wall of the print cartridge and is also identified by the reference designation 71'<br>
for ease of reference. By way of illustrative example, the columnar arrays 73<br>
can be substantially linear. The columnar arrays 73 in turn are arranged in side<br>
by side pairs or groups 75a, 75b, 75c of columnar arrays 73. As shown, there<br>
can be three pairs 75a, 75b, 75c of columnar arrays 73 so as to have six<br>
columnar arrays 73 of contact areas. The pairs 75a, 75c of columnar arrays 73<br>
comprise outboard pairs, while the pair 75b comprises an inboard pair. Each<br>
pair of columnar arrays includes two columnar arrays 73 that diverge from each<br>
other in the direction toward the bottom wall of the cartridge.<br>
The outermost transversely separated columnar arrays are also identified<br>
with the reference designation 73' for ease of reference. Such outermost<br>
transversely separated columnar arrays 73 can have fewer contact areas 71<br>
than the columnar arrays 73 between such outermost transversely separated<br>
columnar arrays. By way of illustrative example, each outermost columnar array<br>
73' includes five contact areas 71, and each of the other columnar arrays 73<br>
includes at least six contact areas 71. By way of specific example, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, a columnar array 73 adjacent one outermost columnar array 73' includes<br>
six contact areas while each of the other columnar arrays 73 between the<br>
outermost arrays 73' includes seven contact areas. Additionally, the outermost<br>
transversely separated columnar arrays 73' can have more contact areas 71<br>
than the columnar arrays 73 between such outermost transversely separated<br>
columnar arrays. Also, the outermost transversely separated columnar arrays<br>
73' can have the same number of contact areas 71 as the columnar arrays 73<br>
between such outermost transversely separated columnar arrays.<br>
Each columnar array 73 spans at least 70% of the height H of the<br>
smallest rectangle R that encloses the array of contact areas 71 and defines a<br>
region occupied by the contact areas 71. The height H is generally vertical. By<br>
way of specific example, the smallest rectangle R has a height H in the range of<br>
about 10 to 14 millimeters and a width W in the range of about 15 to 18<br>
millimeters. The height to width ratio can be in range of about .6 to about .9.<br>
The contact areas 71 of the outermost transversely separated columnar<br>
arrays 73' can spaced center to center at about 2 millimeters from an adjacent<br>
contact area in its columnar array, for example. The contact areas 71 of the<br>
outermost transversely separated columnar arrays 73 can also be spaced<br>
center to center at less than or greater than about 2 millimeters from an<br>
adjacent contact area in its columnar array. The contact areas 71 of each of the<br>
remaining columnar arrays 73 can be spaced no closer center to center than<br>
about 1.7 millimeters from any other contact area in its columnar array, for<br>
example. Alternatively, the contact areas 71 of each of the remaining columnar<br>
arrays 73 can be spaced center to center closer than about 1.7 millimeters from<br>
any other contact area in its columnar array. A contact area 71 in any columnar<br>
array can be spaced no closer center to center than about 1.7 millimeters from a<br>
contact area in an adjacent columnar array, for example. Also, a contact area<br>
71 in any columnar array can be spaced center to center closer than about 1.7<br>
millimeters from a contact area in an adjacent columnar array. The lower<br>
contact areas 71 of adjacent pairs of columnar arrays 73 can be separated by<br>
at leastabout 2.8 millimeters center to center. Alternatively, the lower contact<br>
areas 71 of adjacent pairs of columnar arrays 73 can be separated by less than<br>
about 2.8 millimeters center to center. The lower contact areas 71' of the<br>
columnar arrays 73 between the outermost transversely separated columnar<br>
arrays 73' can be further from the bottom wall than the lower contact areas 71'<br>
of the outermost transversely separated columnar arrays 73'. Alternatively, the<br>
lower contact areas 71' can be at the same distance from the bottom wall, or<br>
they can be at different distances from the bottom wall.<br>
Depending upon implementation, some or all of the contact areas 71, 71'<br>
are electrically connected to the printhead by conductive traces generally<br>
indicated by the reference designation 77. The conductive traces are preferably<br>
disposed on the far side of the flexible circuit 33, which is the side against the<br>
cartridge body, and lead to bond pads 74 on the printhead 15 (FIG. 4).<br>
In FIG. 5, the contact areas include primitive select contact areas P1-<br>
P16 address signal contact areas A1-A13, enable signal contact areas E1-E2,<br>
a temperature sense resistor contact area TSR an identification bit contact area<br>
ID, and ground line contact areas TG1, TG2, BG1, BG2.<br>
Each of the outermost transversely separated arrays 73' can include a<br>
ground contact area (TG1, TG2), while each of the columnar arrays 73 of the<br>
inboard pair 75b can include a ground contact area (BG1, BG2). The ground<br>
contact area BG1 in a columnar array 73 of the inboard pair 75b can be<br>
electrically connected to the ground contact area TG1 in the closest outermost<br>
columnar array 73' by a ground conductive trace 79 that is routed close to the<br>
columnar arrays so as to be only on the portion of the flexible circuit that is on<br>
the rear wall of the print cartridge body. Similarly, the ground contact area BG2<br>
in the other columnar array 73 of the inboard pair 75b can be electrically<br>
connected to the ground contact area TG2 in the closest outermost columnar<br>
array 73' by a ground conductive trace 79 that is close to the columnar arrays so<br>
as to be only on the portion of the flexible circuit that is on the rear wall of the<br>
print cartridge.<br>
FIG. 5A illustrates a contact array similar to that in FIG. 5, but with<br>
different routing of the conductive traces 77 and wherein all of the ground<br>
contact ateas TG1, BG1, BG2, TG2 are interconnected by ground traces 79 that<br>
are on the flexible circuit. Such ground traces can more particularly be located<br>
close to the columnar arrays so as to be only on the portion of the flexible circuit<br>
that is on the rear wall of the print cartridge body.<br>
[39] FIG. 6 shows a contact array similar to that in FIG. 5 but wherein four<br>
contact areas labeled NC are not used. Also, the contact array of FIG. 6<br>
includes twelve primitive select contact areas P1-P12, instead of sixteen, that<br>
are in different locations. The ground contact areas TG1, TG2, BG1, BG2 are<br>
electrically interconnected by ground traces 79 that are routed close to the<br>
columnar arrays so as to be only on the portion of the flexible circuit that is on<br>
the rear wall of the print cartridge body.<br>
The ground contact areas TG1, TG2, BG1, BG2 of the flexible<br>
interconnect circuits of FIGS. 5, 5A, 6 can be in different locations, and can be<br>
interconnected by conductive ground traces that are disposed only on the<br>
portion of the flexible circuit that is on the rear wall of the print cartridge body, for<br>
example.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, set forth therein is a schematic plan view of a<br>
printhead 15 that can be employed with the flexible circuits of FIGS. 5 and 5A.<br>
The printhead includes a plurality of ink drop generators 40 arranged in a<br>
plurality of columnar arrays 61. Each columnar array is arranged in a plurality of<br>
primitive groups such that all of the arrays are arranged in primitive groups PG1-<br>
PG16, for example. Each ink drop generator comprises for example a thermal<br>
ink drop generator formed of a nozzle, an ink chamber, a heater resistor, and<br>
drive circuitry. By way of illustrative example, the ink drop generators 40<br>
receive ink via ink feed slots 71 located adjacent the columnar arrays 61 of ink<br>
drop generators.<br>
The ink drop generators in one of the primitive groups are switchably<br>
coupled in parallel to a respective primitive select signal (FIG. 8, P(1-16)) via an<br>
associated primitive select contact area (P1-P16) of the flexible circuit. One<br>
outboard columnar array 61 contains primitive groups PG1, PG3, PG5, PG7,<br>
while the other outboard columnar array 61 contains primitive groups PG10,<br>
PG12, PG14, PG16. One inboard columnar array includes primitive groups<br>
PG2, PGA PG6, PG8, while another inboard columnar array contains primitive<br>
groups PG9, PG11, PG15, PG13.<br>
FIG. 8 more particularly sets forth a simplified electrical block diagram<br>
illustrating the electrical connection provided by the flexible circuit 33 between<br>
the printer and the printhead. The printer includes a print control device 43<br>
having a source of drive current, an address generator, and an enable<br>
generator. The source of drive current, the address generator, and the enable<br>
generator provide drive current, address signals, and enable signals to the<br>
printhead via the contact bumps 139 of the resilient contact circuit 137 (FIG. 13)<br>
that are contactively engaged with the contact areas 71 of the flexible circuit 33.<br>
£44] For the particular example of a printhead having sixteen primitive groups<br>
PG1-PG16, sixteen separate drive current signals or primitive select signals<br>
P(1-16) are respectively provided via the primitive select contact areas P1-P16<br>
to the primitive groups PG1-PG16. Thirteen separate address signals A(1-13)<br>
are provided via the address contact areas A1-A13, while two enable signals<br>
E(1-2) are provided via the enable contact areas E1-E2.<br>
More particularly as to electrical connections between the flexible circuit<br>
of FIGS. 5 or 5A and the printhead of FIG. 7, primitive select contact areas P1,<br>
P3, P7, P5 in the outboard pair 75c of columnar arrays are electrically<br>
connected to the outboard primitive groups PG1, PG3, PG7, PG5. Primitive<br>
select contact areas P10, P12, P14, P16 in the outboard pair 75a of columnar<br>
arrays are electrically connected to the outboard primitive groups PG10, PG12,<br>
PG14, PG16. Primitive select contact areas P2, P4, P9 P11 in the outboard<br>
pair 75a are connected to inboard primitive groups PG2, PG4, PG9, PG11.<br>
Primitive select contact areas P6, P8, P13, P15 of the inboard pair 75b are<br>
connected to inboard primitive groups PG6, PG8, PG13, PG15.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, set forth therein is a schematic plan view of a<br>
printhead 15 that can be employed with the flexible circuit of FIG. 6. The<br>
printhead includes a plurality of ink drop generators 40 arranged in three<br>
columnar arrays 61. Each columnar array is arranged in a plurality of primitive<br>
groups such that all of the arrays are arranged in primitive groups PG1-PG12,<br>
for example. Each ink drop generator comprises for example a thermal ink drop<br>
generator, formed of a nozzle, an ink chamber, a heater resistor and drive<br>
circuitry. By way of illustrative example, the ink drop generators 40 receive ink<br>
via ink feed slots 71 located adjacent the columnar arrays 61 of ink drop<br>
generators.<br>
The printhead of FIG. 9 is electrically connected to the printer via the<br>
flexible circuit of FIG. 6 in a manner similar to that shown in and described with<br>
respect to FIG. 7, but with twelve primitive select signals P(1-12) for the<br>
primitive groups PG1-PG12.<br>
The ink drop generators in one of the primitive groups (PG1-PG12) are<br>
thus switchably coupled in parallel to a respective primitive select signal P(1-12)<br>
via an associated primitive select contact area (P1-P12) of the flexible circuit of<br>
FIG. 6. One outboard columnar array 61 of the printhead of FIG. 9 contains<br>
primitive groups PG1-PG4, while the other outboard columnar array 61 contains<br>
primitive groups PG9-PG12. The inboard columnar array includes primitive<br>
groups PG5-PG8.<br>
More particularly as to the electrical connections between the flexible<br>
circuit of FIG. 6 and the printhead of FIG. 9, primitive select contact areas P1-P4<br>
in the outboard pair 75c of columnar arrays are electrically connected to the<br>
outboard primitive groups PG1-PG4. Primitive select contact areas P9-P12 in<br>
the outboard pair 75a of columnar arrays are electrically connected to the<br>
outboard primitive groups PG9-PG12. Primitive select contact areas P5, P6 in<br>
the outboard pair 75a are connected to inboard primitive groups PG5, PG6,<br>
while primitive select contact areas P7 P8 in the inboard pair 75b are<br>
connected to inboard primitive groups PG7, PG8.<br>
Thus, in general as to the flexible circuits of FIGS. 5, 5A and 6, and the<br>
printheads of FIGS. 8 and 9, a first outboard pair of columnar arrays of contact<br>
areas includes primitive select contact areas electrically connected to a first set<br>
of outboard primitive groups, a second outboard pair of columnar arrays of<br>
contact areas includes primitive select contact areas electrically connected to a<br>
second set of outboard primitive groups and to a set of inboard primitive groups,<br>
and an inboard pair of columnar arrays of contact areas includes primitive select<br>
contact areas electrically connected to another set of inboard primitive groups.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 10-17, the print carriage 119 more particularly<br>
includes a base 126 that supports the structure, and two C-shaped bearings<br>
128 located at the ends of the base 126. These C-shaped bearings 128 slidably<br>
support the print carriage 119 on the slider rod 121. The print carriage 119<br>
further includes two chutes 131 that each receive, hold, and align an ink jet print<br>
cartridge 11. Both chutes are constructed and operate similarly. Each chute<br>
includes a rear wall 135 that comprises for example a portion of the base 126, a<br>
left side wall 133 that extends from the rear wall 135, and a right side wall 134<br>
that extends from the rear wall 135 and is generally parallel to the left side wall<br>
133.<br>
Carriage datums CY1, CZ1 and CX1 formed for example as part of the<br>
base 126 are located at the bottom of the chute 131 in the vicinity of the<br>
intersection of the left side wall 133 the rear wall 135, while carriage datums<br>
CY2 and CZ2 for example as part of the base 126 are located at the bottom of<br>
the chute 131 in the vicinity of the intersection of the right side wall 134 and the<br>
rear wall 135. A carriage datum CY3 is located on the rear wall 135.<br>
A resilient contact circuit 137 is located on the rear wall 135 of the chute<br>
and contains electrical contacts that are urged against corresponding contacts<br>
on the flex circuit 33 of the print cartridge 11. The resilient contact circuit 137<br>
further functions as a resilient element that urges the print cartridge datums<br>
PY1, PY2 against carriage datums CY1, CY2 when the print cartridge 11 is<br>
installed. By way of illustrative example, the resilient contact circuit 137<br>
comprises a flexible circuit and resilient pad located between the flexible circuit<br>
and the rear wall 135.<br>
A cantilever spring 146 is located adjacent the right side wall 134, and<br>
functions to urge the print cartridge away from the right side wall 134 along the<br>
X-axis, so that the print cartridge datum PX1 is snugly engaged against the<br>
carriage datum CX1 (as shown in FIG. 16).<br>
Located in each side wall 133,134 is a shaped guide channel 140. The<br>
guide channels 140 engage lips 29 of the lid 31 of the print cartridge 11, and<br>
guide the cartridge at an appropriate elevation and pitch (or rotation) of the<br>
cartridge about the X axis as the cartridge is inserted, so as to guide the<br>
cartridge-into the general vicinity of the carriage datums. By way of illustrative<br>
example, each guide channel comprises upper and lower rails 140a, 140b or a<br>
recessed slot having appropriate sides.<br>
A cross bar 179 (see FIG. 10) spans the upper part of the front portion of<br>
chute 131 and is located above the guide channels 140. The cross bar<br>
prevents insertion of the cartridge from above, and further prevents spreading<br>
of the side walls in the event the cartridge is forced too low in the chute.<br>
Located at the top of each chute 131 is a hinged latch assembly 150<br>
(FIG. 10 and FIG. 14) that includes a latch support arm 151 that is pivotally<br>
attached by a hinge 153 to the top of the rear wall 135 so as to be hingably<br>
rotatable about a hinge axis that is parallel to the X-axis. The latch support arm<br>
151 is generally L-shaped having a first leg 151a that extends from the hinge<br>
153 and a second leg 151b that extends generally downwardly from the distal<br>
end of the first leg 151a. Latch hooks 155 are located at the ends of the second<br>
leg 151b for engaging latch tabs 157 disposed at the front of the side walls 133,<br>
134.<br>
A pivoting biased clamp lever 159 is pivotally attached to the lower side<br>
of the latch arm 151 by a pivoting clamp hinge 161 that is displaced from the<br>
latch arm hinge 153 and parallel thereto so as to be pivotable about a pivoting<br>
clamp hinge axis that is parallel to the X axis. The clamp lever 159 extends<br>
generally toward the chute rear wall 135 when the latch is closed, and forms an<br>
acute angle with an imaginary line that extends between the latch arm hinge<br>
axis and the pivoting clamp hinge axis. The clamp lever 159 is biased by a<br>
spring 163 to pivot away from the latch arm 151. Stops 165 on either side of the<br>
clamp lever 159 limit the rotation of the track lever away from the latch arm 151.<br>
A land 167 is disposed at the distal portion of the pivoting clamp 159 for<br>
pushing down on the top portion (50b, 50c') of the latch feature 50 of the print<br>
cartridge 11. Extending beyond the land 167 is an extension 169 that prevents<br>
the clamp 159 from jamming on the front latch surface 50a of the latch feature<br>
50.<br>
The pivoting clamp lever 159 further includes tracks 171 in which a<br>
sliding.clamp arm 173 is slidably located for movement generally orthogonally to<br>
the pivoting clamp hinge axis. The sliding clamp arm 173 is biased by a spring<br>
175 to slide along the pivoting clamp lever 159 away from the pivoting latch<br>
hinge 161. Stops 175 limit the displacement of the sliding clamp 173. A sliding<br>
clamp land 177 is disposed at the distal end of the sliding clamp 173 adjacent<br>
the pivoting clamp land 167.<br>
In use, the cartridge 11 is inserted generally horizontally into the chute<br>
131. The guide channels 140 control the elevation and the pitch about the X<br>
axis of the cartridge 11 as it is inserted into the chute 131, such that print<br>
cartridge datums PY1, PY2 move over the corresponding carriage datums CY1,<br>
CY2. The latch arm 151 is then pivoted downwardly which causes the sliding<br>
clamp land 177 and the pivoting clamp land 167 to eventually engage the front<br>
latch surface 50a and top portion (50b, 50c') of the latch feature 50 on the top of<br>
the cartridge. Continued displacement of the latch arm 151 causes the sliding<br>
clamp 173 to resiliency push on the latch feature generally along the Y axis, and<br>
further causes the pivoting clamp 159 to push on the latch feature generally<br>
along the Z axis. The push generally along the Y axis is independent of the<br>
push generally along the Z axis. The push along the Z'axis causes the print<br>
cartridge datums PZ1, PZ2 to snugly seat against the carriage datums CZ1,<br>
CZ2. The push along the Y axis causes the print cartridge to pivot about the X<br>
axis so that the print cartridge datum PY3 snugly seats against the carriage<br>
datum CY3. The resilient contact circuit 137 is located so as to cause the print<br>
cartridge datums PY1, PY2 to seat snugly against the carriage datum CY1, CY2<br>
when the print cartridge datums PZ1, PZ2 are engaged with the carriage<br>
datums CZ1, CZ2, and the print cartridge datum PY3 is engaged with the<br>
carriage datum CY3.<br>
The latch arm 151 is further displaced to engage the latch hooks 155 with<br>
the latch tabs 157, which allows the sliding clamp land 177 and the pivoting<br>
clamp land 167 to continually press against the front surface 50a and the top<br>
portion (50b, 50c') of the latch feature 50 along the Y and Z axes so that the<br>
print cartridge datums PY1, PY2, PY3, PZ1, PZ2 are continually engaged with<br>
the corresponding carriage datums CY1, CY2, CY3, CZ1, CZ2. The wire spring<br>
146 pushes the cartridge generally along the X axis so that the print cartridge<br>
datum PX1 is snugly engaged with the carriage datum CX1.<br>
