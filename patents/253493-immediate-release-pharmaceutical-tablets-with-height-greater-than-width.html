				<td>IMMEDIATE RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL TABLETS WITH HEIGHT<br>
GREATER THAN WIDTH<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides immediate release non-homogeneous<br>
compressed pharmaceutical tablets that are taller than they<br>
are wide, said novel shape for immediate release tablets<br>
resulting in previously undisclosed advantages with regard<br>
to accurate breaking of the tablet so that breaking of the<br>
tablet may more easily produce predictable quantities of<br>
active ingredient(s).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Pharmaceutical tablets in divisible form containing an<br>
indentation known as a score have long been known and<br>
widely used. Problems with breaking scored tablets are<br>
well-known. These problems include loss of active drug and <br>
inaccurate division of the tablet, so that a tablet<br>
intended to be divided into two equal half-tablets often<br>
does not come close to that ideal.<br>
Many drugs require dosage adjustments, such as warfarin,<br>
the scored tablets of which are frequently broken. These<br>
dosage adjustments through tablet breaking by patients have<br>
been determined to be imprecise. As the following<br>
discussion demonstrates, for many years experts have called<br>
upon the pharmaceutical industry to improve the quality of<br>
tablet breaking, yet such has not been optimized until the<br>
current invention.<br><br><br>
In 1984, Stimpel et al. ("Stimpel"), described the relative<br>
accuracy of breaking of various tablets for treatment of<br>
cardiovascular problems. M. Stimpel et al. , "Breaking<br>
Tablets in Half." The Lancet (1984):1299. Even though<br>
breaking was performed by a sophisticated, dexterous<br>
person, Stimpel found that breaking was not accurate, and<br>
opined that real world use by patients would provide yet<br>
more unsatisfactory results. Stimpel called upon the<br>
pharmaceutical industry to improve the accuracy of<br>
splitting tablets: "Clearly any assumption that halving a<br>
tablet will not lead to inaccurate doses is invalid. This<br>
potential source of inaccuracy could be even more<br>
significant in clinical situations (our study was done<br>
under ideal conditions) and the pharmaceutical industry<br>
should cackle it, either by improving divisibility (as<br>
already has been done for lopressor and logroton) or, even<br>
better, by marketing a wider range of unscored tablets to<br>
provide all the doses that might be indicated clinically."<br>
Despite that finding and statement, and despite the<br>
issuance of various patents relating to optimizing a<br>
scoring pattern and/or tablet shape, Rodenhuis et al. ,<br>
(2004) noted that: "Improving the functioning of score<br>
lines may be a more practical approach than banning this<br>
dosage form" (emphasis added). N. Rodenhuis et al., "The<br>
rationale of scored tablets as dosage form." European J. of<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences 21 (2004):305-308 (hereafter<br>
"Rodenhuis"). Rodenhuis observed that European regulatory<br>
authorities started a policy to discourage scoring of<br>
tablets in 1998. This policy change, according to<br>
Rodenhuis, likely related to "many recent reports of bad<br>
functioning score lines" that "many scored tablets are<br><br>
difficult to break," and that "many scored tablets show<br>
unsatisfactory mass uniformity of the subdivided halves."<br>
The authors then go on to describe useful aspects of<br>
scoring tablets. For a comprehensive review article on<br>
this topic, see van Santen, E., Barends, D.M. and Frijlink,<br>
H.W. "Breaking of scored tablets: a review." European J. of<br>
Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 53 (2002):139-145.<br>
Some current studies that demonstrate the severity of the<br>
problem are described below.<br>
Peek et al . , (2002), studied tablet splitting by "elderly<br>
patients" aged 50-79. Peek, B.T., Al-Achi, A., and Coombs,<br>
S.J. "Accuracy of Tablet Splitting by Elderly Patients."<br>
The Journal of the American Medical Association 288 No.4<br>
(2002) : 139-145. Breaking scored tablets with mechanical<br>
tablet splitters without specific instruction led to highly<br>
unsatisfactory separating of the tablets. For example,<br>
warfarin 5 mg was on average split into 1.9 and 3.1 mg<br>
tablets. This potent anticoagulant has such a narrow<br>
therapeutic range that 2, 2.5, and 3 mg tablet doses are<br>
manufactured. Biron et al. , (1999), demonstrated that<br>
warfarin 10 mg also often split to less than 4.25 or<br>
greater than 5.75 mg. Biron, C, Liczner, P., Hansel, S.<br>
and Schved, J.F., "Oral Anticoagulant Drugs: Do Not Cut<br>
Tablets in Quarters." Thromb Haemost 1201 (1999). In<br>
addition, they demonstrated that loss of mass due to<br>
crumbling or chipping from the breaking of the warfarin<br>
tablets was statistically significant. They also<br>
demonstrated that quartering of the tablets was grossly<br>
inaccurate.<br>
McDevitt et al. , (1998), found that 25 mg unscored<br>
hydrochlorothiazide tablets were manually split badly<br><br>
enough that 12.4% deviated by more than 20% from ideal<br>
weight. McDevitt, J.T., Gurst, A.H. and Chen, Y. "Accuracy<br>
of Tablet Splitting." Pharmacotherapy 18 No.1 (1998):193-<br>
197. 77% of the test subjects stated that they would be<br>
willing to pay a premium for individually produced 12.5 mg<br>
tablets rather than split 25 mg unscored tablets.<br>
Rosenberg et al. , (2002), studied pharmacist-dispensed<br>
split tablets. Rosenberg, J.M., Nathan, J.P. and<br>
Plakogiannis, F. "Weight Variability of Pharmacist-<br>
Dispensed Split Tablets." Journal	of	American<br>
Pharmaceutical Association 42 No.2 (2002):200-205. They<br>
found that "tablet splitting resulted in an unacceptably<br>
high incidence of weight variation." They recommended that<br>
"standards should be developed to ensure uniformity of<br>
split tablets."<br>
Teng et al . , (2002), using a trained individual in a<br>
laboratory setting to split tablets, concluded that "the<br>
majority of the 11 drug products we tested, when assessed<br>
for their ability to be split into half-tablets of equal<br>
dose, failed a liberally interpreted USP (United States<br>
Pharmacopeia) uniformity test. . . The practice of dividing<br>
tablets to save costs or to improve a dosage regimen .<br>
is not recommended for patients using drugs with more<br>
substantial toxicity and steep dose-response efficacy<br>
curves." Teng, J., Song, C.K., Williams, R.L. and Polli,<br>
J.E. "Lack of Medication Dose Uniformity in Commonly Split<br>
Tablets." Journal of American Pharmaceutical Association 42<br>
No. 2 (2002) :195-199.<br>
Rodenhuis reported that 31% of all tablets in one<br>
Netherlands study were subdivided before being swallowed.<br><br>
In the U.S., "managed care" insurance organizations may<br>
encourage splitting by patients of unscored tablets that<br>
may not even have symmetrical shapes. Many drug products<br>
in the US either are unscored tablets, or are provided as<br>
capsules despite being able to be produced as tablets.<br>
The invention is directed to amelioration of the problems<br>
described above.<br>
In addition, treatment with combination products is common<br>
in pharmaceuticals, meaning that one dosage form may<br>
contain more than one active ingredient. This means of<br>
treatment may in part be discussed as follows:<br>
A relevant field to the invention is the field of<br>
combination drug therapy for systemic arterial hypertension<br>
("hypertension"). Technically, combination therapy for<br>
hypertension involves the use of two or more drugs on a<br>
regular basis to treat a patient's hypertension.<br>
Generally, this term implies daily treatment with at least<br>
two drug products.<br>
Combination therapy has long been used to treat<br>
hypertension. It is widely estimated that approximately<br>
halt of all cases of hypertension cannot be treated to goal<br>
blood pressure with one drug at a maximally tolerated<br>
dosage. To aid in treatment, solid oral dosage forms have<br>
been produced that contain a plurality of active agents<br>
within one tablet or capsule. These dosage forms are known<br>
as "fixed-dose" combination products, because a patient or<br>
pharmacist has no means of separating one active agent from<br>
another. Sica, D., Drugs, 2002; 62 (3): "Rationale for<br>
Fixed-Dose Combinations in the Treatment of Hypertension,"<br>
states that "a considerable legacy, dating to the 1950's,<br><br>
exists tor fixed-dose combination therapies." Later in the<br>
same article, the author pinpoints a deficiency with the<br>
fixed-dose approach, which embodiments of the current<br>
invention largely correct: "A disadvantage to the use of<br>
fixed-dose combination is a lack of dose administration<br>
flexibility for its individual components, although it is<br>
uncommon for physicians to maximally exploit the dose<br>
administration flexibility inherent to the use of free<br>
combinations. With fixed-dose combination therapy, if<br>
conditional amounts of either drug are required for BP<br>
control, a separate prescription will be required. This<br>
increases complexity of the regimen and has the potential<br>
to negatively affect compliance. In addition, fixed-dose<br>
combination therapy may not provide adequate drug amounts<br>
to manage illnesses, such as angina or congestive heart<br>
failure, which commonly co-exist with hypertension."<br>
The invention provides a means to improve the above<br><br>
Situation, by allowing flexibility of dosing within a<br>
combination dosage form.<br>
The current invention describes a tablet shape adapted for<br>
separating one vertically disposed segment from another.<br>
In the large field of immediate release pharmaceuticals,<br>
the relative dimensions of the tablet are novel <br>
Commercially, the only product that as produced is taller<br>
than it is wide is Concerta®, which is a three-segment<br>
tablet, two of which segments are devoted to controlled<br>
release of the active drug, methylphenidate. Concerta<br>
utilizes the OROS® system, which utilizes the taller-than-<br>
wide geometry as part of its controlled release<br>
characteristics. The manufacturer's directions for the use<br>
of Concerta specify that the tablets should never be<br><br>
broken.<br>
Except for Concerta, tablets, including those involving<br>
layers vertically disposed one on the other, have been<br>
produced wider than they are tall.<br>
A tablet press manufacturer, Korsch AG of Germany, has<br>
developed a tablet press that can produce up to five<br>
vertically disposed layers. It has been utilized to<br>
produce taller-than-wide five-layer tablets having no<br>
active drugs therein and has also been used to manufacture<br>
Concerta.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to an immediate release<br>
compressed pharmaceutical tablet that has two or more<br>
segments, has a top and a bottom, and has a height that<br>
exceeds the width of said tablet, said height being<br>
measured vertically from the top to the bottom of said<br>
tablet while it is in the tablet die in which it is fully<br>
compressed, after said compression has been completed; and<br>
said width being measured as the greatest horizontal<br>
dimension of the tablet at a location halfway between said<br>
top and said bottom of said tablet, except that when the<br>
horizontal cross-section of said tablet is substantially<br>
rectangular, the width is defined by locating the two<br>
shorter sides of the perimeter of said horizontal cross-<br>
section, and measuring the length of a line that is at<br>
right angle to said shorter sides.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the immediate release compressed<br><br>
pharmaceutical tablet is one that comprises two or more<br>
segments disposed one above the other.<br>
The invention contemplates immediate release<br>
pharmaceutical tablets, preferably containing a .<br>
pharmacologically effective quantity of a drug, where the<br>
height of the tablet (vertical dimension) exceeds its width<br>
(horizontally dimension); i.e., the tablet is taller than<br>
it is wide. The terms "vertical" and "horizontal"<br>
("horizontal" is also referred to as "transverse") axis of<br>
the tablets of the invention are determined by and have the<br>
same orientation as that of the tablet die in which the<br>
tablet: is compressed in a tablet press or other tabletting<br>
machine ("tablet press" herein), and the order of entry of<br>
granulations into the die.<br>
Tablets of the invention are most preferably produced for<br>
commercial sale in a high-speed tabletting machine.<br>
Tablets are produced in a die of said tabletting machine.<br>
In such a machine, granulations enter the tablet die one on<br>
top o£ another, so that said granulations are said to be<br>
vertically disposed to each other. Layers and segments<br>
formed from vertically disposed granulations are considered<br>
to be vertically disposed, as well. The height<br>
("tallness") of a tablet is measured as the vertical<br>
distance between the lowest part of the first granulation<br>
to enter the die to the highest part of the last<br>
granulation to enter the die (said first granulation forms<br>
the bottom layer and said last granulation forms the top<br>
layer).<br><br>
The width is a horizontal (transverse) dimension. In<br>
determining the width, diagonal measurements are not taken<br>
through the horizontal aspect of the tablet if the tablet<br>
is substantially rectangular in transverse cross-section:<br>
If the perimeter of the horizontal aspect of the tablet<br>
were rectangular (and not square) , then the width of the<br>
tablet would be the greater of the two perimeter<br>
measurements as is typically used to describe a rectangle,<br>
and not the diagonal that is calculated by the Pythagorean<br>
theorem and that uses said perimeter measurements to<br>
calculate said diagonal. Similarly, tablets with a<br>
substantially rectangular vertical cross-sectional<br>
configuration have a height that is measured as a perimeter<br>
and not; a diagonal measurement. When a vertical or<br>
horizontal cross-sectional configuration is not<br>
substantially rectangular, which includes triangles,<br>
rhombi, and hexagons, the greatest dimension through said<br>
cross-uection represents said height or width.<br>
Many of the preferred tablets of the invention utilize<br>
segments that lack a pharmacologically effective dose of a<br>
drug to serve as a region for breaking if an art accurated<br>
partial dose of drug found in the whole tablet is desired. <br>
By convention herein, the term "contains a drug," when used<br>
to refer to a granulation, layer, or segment of a tablet,<br>
said granulation, layer, or segment has within it a<br>
pharmacologically effective dose of a drug. The term<br>
"contain a drug" when used to refer to a plurality of<br>
granulations, layers or segments , such as two granulations<br>
or two segments, means that said granulations, layers etc.<br>
have within them a pharmacologically effective dose of a<br>
drug. The term "contain a drug or drugs" when used to<br>
refer to a granulation, layer, or segment means that said<br><br>
granulation, layer or segment may contain either a single<br>
drug or a specific ratio of a plurality of drugs. When<br>
"contain a drug or drugs" is used' to refer to a plurality<br>
of segments, layers, or granulations, that term means that<br>
the plurality of granulations, layers or segments may<br>
contain either a single drug or a specific ratio of a<br>
plurality of drugs.<br>
A layer or segment, but not a granulation, is said to "lack<br>
a drug (or drugs)" if said layer or segment either contains<br>
none of said drug (or drugs) or contains a<br>
pharmacologically ineffective amount of said drug.<br>
Parts of speech, such as "contain" "contains" "containing,"<br>
and "lacking" in relation to the above two paragraphs also<br>
are terms of art with otherwise the same meanings to those<br>
described therein.<br>
In preferred embodiments, but without limitation, the<br>
invention comprises compressed immediate release<br>
pharmaceutical tablets where one or more drugs are disposed<br>
in segments where:<br>
(a)	said tablet includes two or more segments that contain<br>
the same drug or drugs in the same or different<br>
concentrations relative to the excipients found in said<br>
segments, and the tablet is not provided with another drug<br>
than is found in said segments; or<br>
(b)	said tablet includes two or more segments, each segment<br>
of which contains a different drug or drugs;<br>
(c)	said tablet includes a first segment containing a drug<br>
or drugs; a second segment; and a third segment containing<br>
a drugs or drugs which are different from the drug or drugs<br><br>
in said first segment, said second segment being interposed<br>
between said first and said third segment (i.e., below one<br>
of said segments and above the other) and said second<br>
segment lacks said drug or drugs.<br>
(d) said tablet includes a first segment containing a<br>
drug or drugs; a second segment; and a third segment<br>
containing the same drug as the drug in said first<br>
segment, said second segment being interposed between said<br>
first and said third segment, and said second segment<br>
lacking said drug or drugs.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment, the tablets of the<br>
invention have at least two compositionally distinct<br>
segments, with a first segment containing an active drug or<br>
drugs in a pharmacologically effective amount and a second<br>
segment that:<br>
(a)	contains the same drug at a lower concentration than<br>
the concentration of said drug in said first segment, or<br>
contains the same ratio of the drugs in said segment; or<br>
(b)	lacks said drug or drugs present in said first segment<br>
and the tablet also has a third segment containing the same<br>
drug that is present in said first segment; or<br>
(c)	lacks said drug or drugs in said first segment, and<br>
said tablet also has a third segment containing a drug or<br>
drugs different from any in said first segment, wherein<br>
said first and third segments are chemically and physically<br>
compatible; or<br>
(d)	has a different drug than the drug in said first<br>
segment and also includes a third segment containing the<br>
same drug that is present in said first segment.<br>
A further preferred embodiment may optionally contain such<br>
guidelines for tablet breaking as a score, indicia, printed<br><br>
indicia, a perforation, contrasting color segments, and the<br>
like on or in the side of the tablet, with a score<br>
preferably being substantially horizontal to allow tablet<br>
breaking only through one segment or an interface between<br>
segments. A side of a tablet is an external part of said<br>
tablet that has a vertical part that is substantially<br>
parallel to the theoretical vertical axis of the tablet; a<br>
side is in contact with the inner wall or face of the<br>
tablet die in which said tablet is compressed.<br>
Taller than wide tablets of the invention are shaped to be<br>
more easily broken through the tablet's theoretical<br>
vertical axis (i.e., in a horizontal direction) than are<br>
conventional, currently-manufactured tablets having a<br>
"wider than tall" configuration. Many preferred uses of<br>
tablets of the invention are to break through an interposed<br>
segment of the tablet lacking a pharmacologically effective<br>
dose of a drug without breaking through a segment above or<br>
below said interposed segment.<br>
It is a primary object of the invention to provide an<br>
immediate release pharmaceutical tablet that may be easily<br>
broken to provide a partial dose of a drug or drugs that is<br>
contained in said tablet.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide an<br>
immediate release pharmaceutical tablet having three<br>
segments, one of which is an interposed segment which is<br>
adapted to be broken through in such a manner as to keep<br>
the segments between which it is interposed and that<br>
contain pharmacologically effective quantities of a drug or<br>
drugs substantially intact if said tablet is broken through<br>
said interposed segment.<br><br>
These and other objects of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the present application.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tablets of the invention are preferably those compressed in<br>
a tablet press. For commercial use, a high-speed three<br>
(3)- or five (5)-station press produced by Korsch AG may be<br>
utilized. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 20th Ed.,<br>
Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (2000), Chapter 45, which<br>
is incorporated by reference, describes the various<br>
techniques utilized in making compressed tablets. The<br><br>
tablets of the invention are primarily intended for oral<br>
admirn stration but they may also be used for other<br>
applications. Tablets of the invention are not formed<br>
using a cement, glue, adhesive, or the like, and are<br>
preferably uncoated.<br>
The tablets of the invention will comprise at least two<br>
compositionally different segments.<br>
A segment represents the entirety of a contiguous,<br>
substantially homogeneous part of a tablet or tablette (see<br>
below) of the invention. If two or more consecutive<br>
granulations entering the die are substantially identical,<br>
then when compressed, they will form one segment. Such a<br>
segment is a sub-type of segment that may be referred to<br>
specifically as a compound segment. If, however, two<br>
substantially non-identical granulations (such as those<br>
containing different active drugs, the same active drugs in<br>
different ratios, different excipients or different ratios<br>
of similar excipients, or different salts of the same<br>
active drug) were compressed onto each other, they would<br>
comprise two segments. Granulations comprising the same<br>
active drug in the same concentration relative to<br>
excipients but with dissimilar excipients would comprise<br>
two segments if one granulation were compressed onto<br>
another.<br>
A layer is produced by introducing an amount of an<br>
individual granulation into a tablet die to fill at least a<br>
part of the die. A layer is considered to be present<br>
whether it is the form of an un-tamped, tamped or fully<br>
compressed granulation.<br><br>
In many of the most preferred tablets of the invention, a<br>
layer, (and the granulation from which it is derived), will<br>
not need to be placed on top of or below (e.g., adjoining,<br>
or contiguous with) a substantially identical layer (or<br>
granulation) . In such a case, one layer will give- rise to<br>
the sub-type of segment that is a simple segment. The use<br>
of the term "segment" allows a segment to be simple or<br>
compound.<br>
Because the tablets of the invention have been adapted to<br>
be broken if and when desired, it has proven useful to<br>
develop a term for the major fragments of said breaking.<br>
The inventors use the term "tablette" in this regard. An<br>
example of tablette formation is as follows. A standard<br>
single-scored, mono-layer, homogeneous pharmaceutical<br>
tablet is broken. Said breaking produces two major<br>
fragments, each of which is called a tablette, generally<br>
plus some chips and crumbling which are preferably minor in<br>
amount. In the segmented, layered tablets of the<br>
invention, to utilize the invention properly may make it<br>
advantageous to place a score transversely into a segment,<br>
such as an inner segment, as may be done with an instrument<br>
such as a file. Successfully breaking said tablet through<br>
said score will result in two tablettes, representing the<br>
two major fragments of the tablet and not including smaller<br>
fragments such as crumbs or chips. The accompanying<br>
diagrams help clarify the relationship of tablets to<br>
tablettes.<br>
The terms "active agent," "drug," "active drug," active<br>
pharmaceutical agent," "pharmacologically active agent" are<br>
interchangeable and include, without limitation,<br>
prescription and non-prescription pharmaceutical compounds,<br><br>
as well as pharmacologically effective doses of vitamins,<br>
cofactors, and the like. Substances such as foodstuffs,<br>
vitamins in "recommended daily allow" quantities, and the<br>
like are not considered to be "drugs" herein.<br>
The term "undetectable amount" means that using<br>
conventional analytical techniques such as high performance<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
imaging (NMRI), and the like, the presence of an active<br>
compound can not be identified. The term "pharmacologically<br>
ineffective amount" means an amount of a drug or drugs that<br>
has or have no measurable pharmacological effect. Due to<br>
the conditions under which high speed automated tabletting<br>
equipment are operated, mixing of different granulations<br>
may occur during tablet formation which may cause material<br>
such as drug substance present in one granulation to appear<br>
in a layer or segment where it was not intended to be<br>
placed.<br>
The term "relatively inactive segment" refers to a segment<br>
that either contains an undetectable amount of any drug or<br>
contains a diminished concentration of any<br>
pharmacologically effective drug or drugs contained in<br>
another segment or segments.<br>
The terminology used herein is for the purpose of providing<br>
a general understanding and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
As an example of a method of manufacture of a preferred<br>
tablet of the invention, first, a granulation containing a<br>
pharmacologically effective dose of a drug enters the die<br>
and is tamped. Second, a granulation lacking a drug (an<br>
"inactive granulation") enters the die and is tamped.<br><br>
Optionally, another inactive granulation lacking active<br>
drug also enters the die and is tamped. The inactive<br>
granulation (s) creates a part of the tablet that can be<br>
identified and broken through so that a part of the drug<br>
containing a significant concentration of drug is not<br>
broken through. Last, a second granulation containing a<br>
pharmacologically effective quantity of a drug enters the<br>
die, is optionally tamped, and then final compression to<br>
form a compressed tablet occurs. While one or all segments<br>
may individually have a width greater than height, the<br>
tablet as a whole has a height that exceeds its width.<br>
Subsequent to tablet formation, optionally a score may be<br>
placed in the side of said tablet, preferably transversely.<br>
Alternatively, after tablet formation, a printed line or<br>
other forms of indicia such as dotted lines, symbols or<br>
perforations may be placed on or in the surface of the<br>
tablet, all of which serve the purpose of allowing<br>
identification of said tablet's desired breaking region<br>
from the standpoint of effecting accurate separation of the<br>
parts of a tablet containing isolated doses of drug. Other<br>
means ot aiding identification of a region of potentially<br>
desired tablet breaking may be utilized such as the use of<br>
contrasting colors in different segments.<br>
Suitable dimensions for tablets according to the invention<br>
are; height: 6 to 24 mm; preferably 10 to 18 mm and more<br>
preferably from 10 to 14 mm; width (at the widest dimension<br>
of the horizontal axis) : 2 to 16mm; preferably 3 to 10 mm<br>
and more preferably 4 to 8 mm. Without limitation, the<br>
dimensions of the tablet may be optimal if the ratio of the<br>
height to the width is between about 1.5:1 to about 3:1.<br>
Numerous other structures may be created, some of which are<br><br>
further delineated below. Various advantages in the<br>
treatment: of human patients and other animals in need are<br>
created by tablets of the shape described.<br>
Tablets of the invention are most preferably formed in a<br>
high-speed tablet press. In a typical manufacturing<br>
procedure, two or more different granulations are<br>
separately fed into a die, utilizing different filling<br>
stations. Wet granulations are often preferred to limit<br>
transfer of material from one granulation to another.<br>
Direct compression of powder is also a preferred<br>
manufacturing technique.<br>
Full entry of a granulation at a filling station produces a<br>
layer. Tablets of the invention have a layered structure.<br>
It may be relevant to add two consecutive substantially<br>
identical inactive granulations to form two identical,<br>
contiguous layers. After compression, the part of the<br>
tablet formed by said two identical granulations is<br>
referred to as a segment. The type of segment so formed is<br>
called a compound segment. There also may, in the case in<br>
which a large quantity of an active ingredient is desired<br>
to be in one segment, be cause to have two substantially<br>
identical granulations containing said active ingredient to<br>
enter at two consecutive filling stations, thus producing,<br>
after final compression to form a tablet, a compound<br>
segment that contains active drug. The more common case is<br>
that in which a first granulation enters the die not on top<br>
of a substantially identical granulation (layer), forms a<br>
layer, and a substantially non-identical (i.e., different)<br>
granulation next enters said die, so that said first<br>
granulation forms a layer that is not contiguous with a<br><br>
substantially identical layer. Said first granulation<br>
form;; a layer that is considered to be a simple segment in<br>
the compressed tablet.<br>
The benefits of the invention include the utilization<br>
preferably of inactive granulations, and less preferably,<br>
segments with diminished concentration of a drug relative<br>
to another segment. Optimally the tablet is provided with<br>
a means of identifying an optimal breaking region and of<br>
identifying one tablette from another after tablet<br>
breaking, an important benefit if the tablettes contain<br>
different, types or quantities of a drug or drugs.<br>
Because of the novelty of the tablets, it is necessary	to<br>
describe the top, bottom, sides, etc. of the tablet.	It<br>
has been found best to describe the tablet with regard	to<br>
such terms based on said tablet's formation and location	in<br>
the die in which said tablet is formed.<br>
As used herein, such terms as "horizontal" ("transverse")<br>
and "vertical" when used in relation to a tablet, are based<br>
on the spatial orientation of the tablet as, and after, it<br>
is produced in a die, but before removal or ejection from<br>
the die. Current methods of manufacture produce tablets<br>
with one granulation entering the die on top of another, so<br>
that tablets of the invention produced in such a manner<br>
comprise one or more top (outer) segments, one or more<br>
bottom (outer) segments, and optionally one or more middle<br>
(inner) segments. A segment that is not a top or bottom<br>
(collectively, "outer") segment is considered to be an<br>
inner segment, even though of course an inner segment has<br>
an external aspect. The number of inner segments is not<br>
limited.<br><br>
The bottom segment of a tablet contains the first<br>
granulation into the die. The top segment of a tablet<br>
contains the last granulation to enter the die. A "side"<br>
of the tablet refers to that external part of said tablet<br>
in contact with the internal vertical face or aspect of the<br>
tablet die in which said tablet is produced. Typically,<br>
sides of the tablets of the invention are vertically<br>
oriented, in contrast to the tops and bottoms of the<br>
invention. In the case of cupping and beveling of the top<br>
of the tablet, which may from time to time be extensive,<br>
the tablet's side is considered to also include the<br>
external part of the tablet that was in contact with the<br>
internal vertical face or aspect of the tablet die before a<br>
top punch formed said cupping, beveling, or the like.<br>
If separate granulations were to be sequentially placed in<br>
a die horizontally (side-to-side) and not vertically as is<br>
currently the practice, then the tablets so produced would<br>
be within the scope of the present invention as the same<br>
product would be produced. When the tablet of Fig. 1, for<br>
example, is laid on a flat table, it will tend to lie<br>
lengthwise at right angles to the manner in which it is<br>
formed in the die (i.e., its longest axis would lie<br>
horizontally in relation to the tabletop) , so that if the<br>
three segments were all different colors, then the segments<br>
would appear to be arranged not vertically (one on top of<br>
the other), but rather horizontally (side-to-side). For<br>
consistency of terminology, such segments nonetheless are<br>
considered herein to be disposed vertically on top of each<br>
other, because of the manner in which they were created.<br><br>
The major advantage of the invention is that it optimizes<br>
optional tablet breaking. When force is applied to break a<br>
tablet, breaking of the tablet tends to more easily produce<br>
predictable quantities of active ingredient(s) in tablettes<br>
than "wider than tall" tablets with segments containing the<br>
same quantities of drugs. The tablet may be broken<br>
according to the invention either by applying force such as<br>
a cutting edge directly to the region to be broken through,<br>
or to outer segments, potentially in either case breaking<br>
through an inner segment.<br>
Examples of: specific embodiments of the invention are best<br>
described with reference to the drawings. Shaded areas<br>
represent segments derived from active granulations, i.e.,<br>
those which contain a drug; clear (plain) areas represent<br>
segments derived from inactive granulations, i.e., those<br>
formulated with no active drug.<br>
The drawings depict vertical cross-sectional views of<br>
tablets and tablettes of the invention. Tablets are<br>
depicted as if they were in the die, so that the top of the<br>
tablet as it is oriented on the page corresponds with the<br>
top of the tablet in the die. In other words, the top<br>
segment. of the tablet as viewed contains the last<br>
granulation to enter the die. Tablettes are depicted as<br>
they would have been in the die before they were separated<br>
from the intact tablet.<br>
"Front views" refer to a cross-sectional view of a tablet<br>
that has a theoretical geometric plane passed through the<br>
tablet relative to a side which is arbitrarily designated<br>
as the tront. Figures labeled as "side view," which also<br>
have a corresponding "front view" are taken as a cross-<br>
section through the whole tablet from the right side of a<br><br>
front view i.e., a side view is a cross-section that is<br>
taken by passing a plane through the vertical axis of the<br>
whole tablet at a 90o angle to the cross-sectional front<br>
view. Each front view represents a schematic cross-section<br>
that passes through the midpoint of the horizontal cross-<br>
section a:; measured from the front of the tablet to the<br>
back of the tablet or tablette. The front view is also<br>
parallel to the major axis of the tablet (e.g., for a<br>
tablet with a rectangular (but not square) transverse<br>
cross-section, the longer side of the perimeter is parallel<br>
with the plane that depicts the cross-sectional, front<br>
view.<br>
That plane is located half-way between the front and back<br>
surfaces of said tablet. The side views of Figs, 1a-b and<br>
2a-b are taken from a vertically-oriented plane that passes<br>
through the midpoint of the longer transverse dimension<br>
(i.e., the width), and thus are located at and<br>
perpendicular to the mid-point of the front view. Drawings<br>
are of tablets that have a rectangular but not square<br>
horizontal cross-section at the vertical mid-point of the<br>
tablet.<br>
Segments containing pharmacologically active amounts of a<br>
drug or drugs are shown crosshatched; pharmacologically<br>
ineffective segments are shown plain (clear, without<br>
crosshatching or stippling) . The upper part of each figure<br>
corresponds to the upper part of a tablet, all of which are<br>
depicted as they are situated within a die after final<br>
compression and before ejection from the die. For<br>
consistency, tablettes are depicted in the same orientation<br>
as the tablets from which they are formed, although<br>
tablettes are created after tablet ejection from the die.<br>
Dotted lines in the tablets depicted in the Figures may<br>
represent printed marks or other indicia, or scores that<br>
are present on or in the surface of the tablet and, if they<br>
represent a score, said score does not extend deeply enough<br><br>
into the tablet to appear in the cross-sectional front<br>
view. TIT; transverse dotted lines reflecting scores shown<br>
in the Figures imply no intention to limit the depth of any<br>
scores of the tablets of the invention. Horizontal dotted<br>
lines on the front views that represent the surface scores<br>
are schematic, and do not necessarily represent the full<br>
vertical extent of a score, printed mark, or the like.<br>
Tablettes are depicted with broken surfaces as indicated by<br>
a fine saw-tooth pattern. Such saw-tooth depiction is<br>
schematic and not intended to represent the actual pattern<br>
of breaking of a tablet (or tablette, which often leads to<br>
irregular edges even if said tablet is broken through a<br>
score.<br>
Grasping and breaking said tablet is easier with the<br>
current , taller-than-wider design than would be the case<br>
under layered (segmented) tablets known to the art, in<br>
which breaking a tablet through one segment only, if<br>
feasible, would require "filleting" the tablet through its<br>
longest axis.<br>
Figures 1a and lb depict a tablet with compositionally<br>
substantially identical upper segment 40 and lower segment<br>
44. Inner segment 42 contains trace amounts of the drug<br>
that is present in a therapeutically effective quantity in<br>
each OL segments 40 and 44. Interfaces 46 and 48 represent<br>
regions in which the upper part of segment 42 and the lower<br>
part: of segment 42 respectively adjbin upper segment 40 and<br>
lower segment 44. The curved interfaces result from the<br>
profile of the upper tablet punch which is curved. Score<br>
52 is depicted in Fig. lb. Dotted line 50 in Fig. la is a<br>
reflection of score 52 on the surface of the tablet (not<br><br>
shown that does not penetrate half-way through the<br>
shorten transverse axis of the tablet.<br>
Figs. 2a-d depict tablettes formed from breaking the tablet<br>
of Figs, 1a and 1b through score 52. Inner segment 42 of<br>
Fig. 1a no longer exists as an intact segment. The upper<br>
tablette of Figs. 1a and 1c contains segment 80 that<br>
adjoins intact upper segment 40 and the lower tablette<br>
contains segment 82 and intact segment 44.<br>
Breaking the tablet of Fig. la and lb through the score<br>
placed in segment 42 is clearly easier than breaking the<br>
tablet through its vertical dimension, which is currently<br>
the practice with scored layered (segmented) tablets. The<br>
fact that no break is made in the parts of the tablet where<br>
the active drug has been placed provides for exceptionally<br>
accurate breaking relative to the active drug or drugs<br>
contained in the tablet.<br>
Fig. 3 demonstrates a two-segment tablet, each segment<br>
formed from a granulation containing a pharmacologically<br>
effective amount of medication. Upper, (outer) segment 124<br>
is larger than lower (outer) segment 126. Interface 128<br>
indicates a region at which said segments are contiguous.<br>
A printed mark on the outer surface of the tablet (not<br>
shown) indicates a desired breaking point, as indicated by<br>
the location of arrow 130 that reflects the position of<br>
said surface printed mark. The two segments also have<br>
different color, however, further allowing identification<br>
of which part of the tablet contains which segment.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b depict the two tablettes formed by breaking<br>
the tablet of Fig. 3. The tablette of Fig. 4a consists of<br><br>
segment. 110, which represents the bulk of segment 124 of<br>
Fig. 3. The tablette depicted in Fig. 4b contains segment<br>
112 in an intact form and segment 120, which represents a<br>
less than half-portion of segment 126 of Fig. 3. Interface<br>
116 indicates a region at which said segments are<br>
contiguous. The curved face is due to the profile of the<br>
tablet punch.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a tablet more elongated than those<br>
previously demonstrated. Said tablet is adapted, even more<br>
than the others, for ease of breaking through one segment.<br>
Upper segment 600 is provided with a therapeutic quantity<br>
of a drug; stippled inner segment 604 is provided with a<br>
therapeutic quantity of a different drug; and, lower<br>
segment 608 is provided with a therapeutic quantity of a<br>
drug different from that found in a therapeutic quantity in<br>
segments 600 and 604. Clear (plain) inner segments 602 and<br>
606 contain pharmacologically ineffective amounts of each<br>
of the three drugs found in the tablet. Interfaces 610,<br>
612, 614, and 616 represent the regions at which two<br>
contiguous segments adjoin. The tablet of Fig. 5 is<br>
provided with a different color for each segment. Even<br>
though there is no surface scoring or indicia, the color<br>
scheme in such that a person's attention may be directed to<br>
apply force to break the tablet through segment 602 to<br>
create the tablettes depicted in Figs. 6a and 6b. Fig. 6a<br>
depicts the smaller tablette created by breaking the tablet<br>
of Fig. 5 through segment 602 in a transverse fashion.<br>
Segment 620 has been created by said breaking, and segment<br>
602 of Fig. 5 no longer exists as an intact segment. Fig.<br>
6b depicts the larger tablette created by said breaking of<br>
the tablet of Fig. 5. New upper segment 622 has been<br>
created.<br><br>
Figs. 7a-c depict three tablettes created by the subsequent<br>
breaking ol the tablette of Fig. 6b. New segment 630 and<br>
segment 6 32 have been created and segment 606 no longer<br>
exists as an intact segment.<br>
Fig. 8 depicts a traditional two-segment tablet. In this<br>
tablet, lower (bottom) segment 324 contains a drug<br>
different from that contained in upper (top) part 322.<br>
Score 328 indents segment 324. Interface 326 is present at<br>
the region at which segments 322 and 324 meet. The tablet<br>
of Fig. 8 is not a tablet of the invention. It depicts a<br>
schematic of a tablet of the prior art of bilayer tablets.<br>
One may readily appreciate the difficulty inherent in<br>
attempting to break a tablet such as the tablet of Fig. 8<br>
horizontally, through one segment only, or, analogously, a<br>
tablet similar to that of Fig. 8 but that in addition was<br>
provided with, say, a segment below that of segment 324.<br>
Benefits of the invention are not limited to tablets of any<br>
specific number of active ingredients. All segments<br>
containing an active ingredient may contain the same drug,<br>
or segments may contain different drugs.<br>
In order to fully realize the benefits of the invention, a<br>
score may be placed into a segment (or interface between<br>
segments) of the tablet. This score may be formed in an<br>
inner segment with a file in a substantially horizontal<br>
mariner, so that breaking the tablet through said score<br>
could lead to breaking through the inner segment while<br>
leaving the outer segments intact.<br>
In addition, similar means of marking tablets may be<br><br>
followed such as by causing an edible ink to be placed on<br>
the tablets, thus delineating a desired region of the<br>
tablet, such as its middle segment. Such application is<br>
well known in the art. Other means of applying indicia are<br>
contemplated as within the scope of the invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF MANUFACTURING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A "taller than wide" tablet is made which has three<br>
segments, each with an active top or upper segment and an<br>
active lower or bottom segment separated by a substantially<br>
inactive middle segment. A Stokes 27-station tri-layer<br>
rotary tablet press is used. All formulations are directly<br>
compressible powder blends. The blending both of the<br>
amlodipino formulation and the benazepril formulation are<br>
performed in a Patterson-Kelly "V" blender. The middle<br>
segment consists of 194 mg of Nu-Tab® and requires no<br>
blending. The tablets are compressed using 0.131 inch by<br>
0.3222 inch oval, concave tablet punches to a hardness of<br>
35 kiloponds. The bottom segment is introduced first into<br>
the die. The tablet weight is 310 mg. Tablets so made are<br>
8 mm tall; the inactive middle segment varies from 5-6 mm<br>
in height and a width of 4mm. Weights in mg of the<br>
granulation comprising each segment are as follow:<br><br><br>

combined weight of layer #1 and layer #2 weight<br>
(tablets should form a soft compact).<br>
6.	Compress the tri- layer tablet to the desired total<br>
tablet weight (layer #1 weight + layer #2 weight +<br>
layer #3 weight) Tablet should be at desired hardness.<br>
A similar tablet of the invention is separately<br>
produced using the same top and bottom segments as the<br>
above, but using the following ingredients instead of Nu-<br>
Tab for the middle segment. The following are blended<br><br><br>
Manufacturing Instructions<br>

The tablets were compressed using oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222<br>
inch, concave tablet punches to a hardness of 35 kiloponds.<br>
The bottom segment was introduced first into the die. The<br>
tablet weight was 280 mg. Tablets with said middle segment<br>
were 6 mm high, and the inactive middle segment was 3.5-4<br>
mm high.<br><br>
Tabletting Instructions<br>
1. Place the powder for active layer in hopper #1.<br>
2 . Place the powder for placebo layer in hopper #2.<br>
3.	Place the powder for active layer in hopper #3.<br>
4.	Compress layer #1 tablets to desired weight (tablets<br>
for layer #1 should form a soft compact).<br>
5.	Compress layer #1 &amp; Layer #2 tablets to desired<br>
combined weight of layer #1 and layer #2 weight<br>
(tablets should form a soft compact).<br>
6.	Compress the tri-layer tablet to the desired total<br>
tablet weight (layer #1 weight + layer #2 weight +<br>
layer #3 weight) Tablet should be at desired hardness.<br>
In a similar way, other taller than wide tablets can be<br>
made on a tablet press, such as, the Korsch TRP900 which<br>
can produce taller tablets due to its design for deep<br>
filling cams which allow for deeper fills and greater<br>
distances between the upper and lower compression tools.<br>
To make an oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222 inch, concave tablet<br>
that is 12mm tall on the Korsch TRP900 the formulator<br>
would have to increase the weight of the inactive Nu-Tab®<br>
middle segment to about 323mg. Similarly to have a<br>
finished tablet height of 14mm the tablet would be<br>
formulated with a middle segment weighing about 3 88mg.<br>
If the formulator preferred, they could use the second<br>
example for a middle layer, i.e., the dibasic calcium<br>
phosphate (DCP) formulation. In such a case making an<br>
oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222 inch, concave tablet that is<br>
12mm tall on the Korsch TRP900 the formulator would have<br>
to increase the weight of the inactive DCP middle segment<br>
to about 410mg. Similarly to have a finished tablet<br><br>
height of 14mm the tablet would be formulated with a<br>
middle segment weighing about 4 92mg.<br>
*****<br>
The invention also includes the method of administering one<br>
or more drugs via the dosage forms such as tablets and<br>
tablettes of the invention to a patient, mammal, or other<br>
animal in need of pharmaceuticals for the prevention or<br>
treatment of an illness, maintenance of good health,<br>
retarding of aging, or other purpose. Included are methods<br>
of treating a patient with only one drug from a combination<br>
product, such as with a novel tablette of the invention,<br>
enabling downward dose adjustment for a variety of reasons;<br>
or, in a similar vein, a patient may be treated with one<br>
whole tablet containing a plurality of active drugs and in<br>
addition receive only one drug from a similar tablet, thus<br>
enabling upward dose adjustment. Combination products that<br>
can benefit from the invention, in which one drug is in an<br>
outer active segment, and a second and different drug is in<br>
the other outer active segment, and an inactive middle<br>
segment as in embodiments such as was described in<br>
paragraphs 3 and 4 above, include those containing the<br>
following pairs of drugs: amlodipine and either benazepril,<br>
chlorthalidone, or atorvastatin; benazepril and<br>
hydrochlorothiazide; olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide;<br>
and many others, including the majority of the currently-<br>
produced combination products. Also included is the method<br>
of treating a patient with a precise partial dose of<br>
medication from a whole tablet, which may be a half or<br>
quarter of the whole dose, but may usefully be a different<br>
fraction. Warfarin especially may usefully be produced and<br>
dosed according to the invention with separable segments of<br>
the tablet that may but need not be as halves, quarters,<br>
etc. L-thyroxine and digoxin are other examples that could<br><br>
so benefit, along with warfarin.<br>
The following give possible clinical situations in which<br>
the tablets of the invention could provide important<br>
benefits.<br>
1. A currently marketed product in the United States is<br>
Caduet®, which contains the active ingredients atorvastatin<br>
calcium (atorvastatin) and amlodipine besylate (amlodipine)<br>
which are largely homogeneously interdispersed in an<br>
unscored tablet. The product is indicated to treat both<br>
hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin) and hypertension<br>
(amlodipine). A patient ingesting this tablet daily may<br>
then undergo a blood test and be diagnosed as having liver<br>
dysfunction as manifested by elevation of an enzyme's<br>
concentration in the blood. The physician may then<br>
recommend cessation, possibly temporary, of atorvastatin,<br>
which is stated by the manufacturer to be a possible cause<br>
of liver dysfunction. A patient receiving Caduet, however,<br>
would have to thus also discontinue amlodipine, which is<br>
not in this example desired by the physician. A tablet of<br>
the invention in which atorvastatin and amlodipine were<br>
segregated in different outer active segments, separated by<br>
a middle segment of adequate dimensions, would be a clear<br>
advance over the current Caduet formulation, because such a<br>
tablet would allow a patient to promptly continue ingesting<br>
amlodipine while stopping ingestion of atorvastatin,<br>
without having to go to a pharmacy and fill a new<br>
prescription for a tablet containing only amlodipine as the<br>
active ingredient, while having previously had the<br>
convenience of having both drugs combined in a single<br>
dosage form. The above embodiment of the invention<br>
represents an improvement over the current Caduet dosage<br><br>
form.<br>
Another clinical situation in which the invention is<br>
superior to Caduet is one in which a patient receiving<br>
amlodipine 5 mg once daily and atorvastatin 20 mg once<br>
daily is advised by a physician to increase the daily<br>
amlodipine dose to 10 mg once daily. A patient in<br>
possession of adequate tablets of the invention, with the<br>
active drugs segregated in a three-segment tablet, would be<br>
able to promptly increase the amlodipine dose by taking a<br>
whole "tablet of the invention once daily, plus a tablette<br>
containing 5 mg of amlodipine, produced by breaking a<br>
second whole tablet of the invention.<br>
Another clinical situation in which the invention is<br>
superior to Caduet involves the case in which a physician<br>
wishes a patient to ingest atorvastatin 20 mg each morning<br>
and amlodipine 2.5 mg twice daily. The invention provides<br>
for amlodipine to be separated from atorvastatin and then<br>
broken precisely in half. The invention thus allows the<br>
patient the advantage of one tablet, whereas to accomplish<br>
this currently in the United States would require one 2 0 mg<br>
Lipitor® (atorvastatin) tablet and two Norvasc®<br>
(amlodipine) 2.5 mg tablets.<br>
2. The combination of amlodipine besylate and benazepril<br>
hydrochloride (benazepril) is marketed in the United States<br>
under the brand name of Lotrel®. This product is a capsule<br>
that is routinely ingested whole. An embodiment of the<br>
invention provides a whole tablet containing one outer<br>
segment containing amlodipine as the only active drug and<br>
the other outer segment containing benazepril as the only<br>
outer drug. If desired, either outer layer may be formed<br><br>
into more than one segment, as in Fig. la. As in example 1<br>
above regarding Caduet, the middle segment is inactive and<br>
may be broken through to create two tablettes, each<br>
comprising a whole amount of each outer active segment plus<br>
approximately half of the amount of the middle inactive<br>
segment. If a patient were to develop a need for double<br>
the dose of one active drug but not the other, the tablet<br>
of the invention could meet that need. Alternatively, if a<br>
patient were to develop a need to ingest only one active<br>
drug, possibly temporarily, due to such conditions as blood<br>
pressure changes or a side effect to one drug but not the<br>
other, the tablet of the invention allows this to be done<br>
without a new dosage form being prescribed.<br>
3. Another use of the invention involves the combination<br>
of amlodipine and chlorthalidone or another diuretic, which<br>
may usefully be combined to treat hypertension. Benefits<br>
of the invention are similar to those described in the<br>
paragraph immediately preceding this paragraph.<br>
4 . Another use of the invention involves the combination<br>
of olmesartan medoxomil (olmesartan, an angiotensin<br>
receptor blocker) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). This<br>
product is currently marketed in the United States under<br>
the name Benicar/HCT®, with the doses, respectively, of, in<br>
mg: 20/12.5, 40/12.5, and 40/25. A very common starting<br>
dose of a patient will be 20/12.5 once daily. The product<br>
is currently marketed in all strengths as a homogeneous<br>
tablet containing both active drugs. Formulated according<br>
to the current invention, a patient who begins treatment<br>
with the 20/12.5 dose may be increased with the same tablet<br>
to each of the other doses by ingesting one whole 20/12.5<br>
tablet and either a half tablet containing 20 mg of<br><br>
olmesartan or a half tablet containing 25 mg of HCTZ. This<br>
will provide the physician an opportunity to investigate<br>
the new dose before giving the patient a new prescription.<br>
Other advantages of the invention are similar to those<br>
described above.<br>
5.	Another useful combination product that may be<br>
formulated according to the invention involves angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and diuretics such as<br>
HCTZ. Both types of drug not uncommonly have side effects,<br>
so that the invention will be useful to physicians in<br>
dealing with the side effects, as well as with changing<br>
dosing needs to deal with the anti-hypertensive and other<br>
clinical benefits of the drugs.<br>
6.	Another product that may benefit from the invention<br>
regarding separating active drugs in separate outer layers<br>
with an inactive middle segment (layer) is a combination<br>
product containing two active drugs, fluoxetine and<br>
olanzapine.<br>
No limitation to the above therapeutic fields or to the<br>
specific examples within their fields is intended for<br>
tablets of the invention, which may be used in any suitable<br>
combination of drugs. No limitation to two-drug<br>
combinations exists, as well. For instance, one outer<br>
active segment of a tablet according to the invention could<br>
contain levodopa and carbidopa, and the other outer active<br>
segment could contain entacapone, a tablet product<br>
containing all three drugs in a homogeneous fashion that is<br>
currently marketed in the United States as Stalevo®. Also,<br>
a tablet per the invention could involve five layered<br>
segments, with, for example, amlodipine in one outer<br><br>
segment, an inactive segment adjoining it, a middle segment<br>
containing chlorthalidone or HCTZ, and a second inactive<br>
Segment adjoining both it and the other outer segment that<br>
contains benazepril (see Fig. 8). If both inactive<br>
segments were of adequate dimensions to be conveniently<br>
breakable without damaging any of the three active<br>
segments, thus providing significant clinical advantages<br>
due to the adoption of flexible dosing of the different<br>
active segments.<br>
The following list of possible combinations of a plurality<br>
of drugs is exemplary and not limiting. The combinations<br>
referred to may include two or more members of the classes<br>
listed. Drugs listed below, and herein, may for<br>
convenience exclude mention of any salt of a drug; e.g.,<br>
"atorvastatin" is listed even though its marketed form is<br>
atorvastatin calcium.<br>
without limitation, useful combinations may include a<br>
plurality of drugs from within the following six drug<br>
classes.<br>
In addition, tablets of the invention may be created<br>
containing only one of a drug from the following list.<br>
With regards to combination use, two methods of use may<br>
apply to the invention. One of these methods is to place<br>
an individual drug in a granulation and a different<br>
individual drug (or combination of drugs) in a different<br>
granulation, potentially with an inactive granulation<br>
interposed between them; another method is to place a<br>

The combinations of drugs disclosed herein are for<br>
illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
Regarding the important usage of the tablets and tablettes<br>
of the invention, that involving division of a tablet into<br><br>
tablettes containing similar active segments, most drugs<br>
that may undergo dosage adjustment will be preferred if<br>
they may be divided in an optimally precise manner.<br>
Examples of drugs that will especially benefit from the<br>
advances of the invention in this manner include narrow<br>
therapeutic index drugs such as warfarin, digoxin, L-<br>
thyroxine; vasoactive drugs such as amlodipine;<br>
hypoglycemic agents such as rosiglitazone and glipizide;<br>
and anxiolytics drugs such as alprazolam. These are<br>
however but a small fraction of the great mass of drugs<br>
that will benefit from the various embodiments and<br>
procedures of the invention.<br>
There are numerous methods of use of the dosage forms of<br>
the invention, including its tablets and tablettes.<br>
Persons skilled in the medical and pharmaceutical arts will<br>
recognize the many advantages that the various embodiments<br>
of the invention allow over current products. Some<br>
examples of benefits of the inventions involving tablets<br>
containing exactly one similar active segment described<br>
immediately below.<br>
1. Warfarin is an anticoagulant marketed in the U.S. under<br>
the brand name Coumadin®, which is a scored tablet.<br>
Research has shown that patients do not break warfarin 5 mg<br>
tablets into equal 2.5 mg segments. The invention teaches<br>
different types of tablets that allow warfarin tablets of<br>
any common human dose to be broken into precise halves, and<br>
potentially precise thirds, quarters, etc. Thus a patient<br>
may utilize warfarin half-tablets produced as per the<br>
invention with similar confidence as in the whole tablet.<br>
Because warfarin doses are frequently broken, many clinical<br>
scenarios exist in which the invention will benefit<br><br>
patients.<br>
2. Norvasc (amlodipine besylate or amlodipine herein) is<br>
marketed as unscored 2.5, 5, and 10 mg tablets in the U.S.<br>
These tablets are of irregular shape and are difficult to<br>
break. The FDA-approved dosage range is from 2.5 to 10 mg<br>
ingested orally daily. The invention allows improved<br>
functionality of amlodipine. For example, under the<br>
invention, a patient receiving 5 mg daily who a physician<br>
wishes to increase to 7.5 mg daily may simply utilize a<br>
tablet of the invention that comprises two separate 2.5 mg<br>
segments to increase the dose to precisely 7.5 mg, such as<br>
by ingesting one whole 5 mg tablet and one 2.5 mg tablette<br>
created by breaking a 5 mg tablet into two tablettes each<br>
containing 2.5 mg of amlodipine. Convenience and cost<br>
savings are clear. Similarly, a patient receiving a 10 mg<br>
dose of Norvasc who is advised to reduce the dose to 5 mg<br>
daily must currently purchase a new prescription for 5 mg<br>
Norvasc tablets. The invention provides the ability to<br>
provide a 10 mg tablet that may be broke into two<br>
tablettes, each containing precisely 5 mg of <br>
t<br>
The invention may therefore enable greater flexibility of<br>
treating patients, and provide cost savings as well. A<br>
further benefit of the invention is that various<br>
embodiments allow fully accurate separation of a tablet<br>
into a tablette comprising one-fourth of the dose of the<br>
active ingredient as is found in the whole tablet. This<br>
may for example be done for amlodipine by providing four<br>
active segments all containing 2.5 mg of amlodipine and all<br>
contiguous with the same side of an inactive outer segment<br>
(see embodiment #1; and see Fig. 6a modified to have four<br>
and not two active segments) . Thus, a 10 mg amlodipine<br>
tablet of the invention may be utilized to provide a 7.5 mg<br><br>
dose; or, it may be utilized to provide four 2.5 mg doses.<br>
A further benefit of the invention may relate to pediatric<br>
or geriatric doses, which may not be produced in<br>
appropriate dose strengths. In the case of amlodipine, a<br>
1.25 mg daily dose may be useful in either small children<br>
with hypertension, or in frail elderly patients with angina<br>
or hypertension, who may have hepatic dysfunction. Even<br>
though the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
has not approved a 1.25 mg dose, precise divisibility of<br>
the approved 2.5 mg dose would allow a 1.25 mg daily dose.<br>
In addition, precise divisibility of the approved 2.5 mg<br>
dose will allow accurate dosing of 3.75 mg daily.<br>
Another use of the invention is to for the first time<br>
enable a method of cost savings to insurers and patients.<br>
The invention allows this because many drugs, such as<br>
Norvasc and Coumadin, have pricing that differs little (if<br>
at all) between different doses. Because tablet splitting<br>
is imprecise for most scored tablets, the practice of<br>
mandatory splitting has been met with disapproval by most<br>
physician and pharmacist organizations. The invention<br>
enables tablet splitting due to provide accurate dosing<br>
when a tablet (or some tablettes, as in Fig. lb) of the<br>
invention are broken as described herein. Substantial<br>
benefits are foreseen from this innovation. In addition,<br>
the ability to separate one active drug from another in a<br>
combination product has cost saving advantages, as well.<br>
It is recognized that related inventions may be within the<br>
spirit of the disclosures herein. Also no omission in the<br>
current application is intended to limit the inventors to<br>
the current claims or disclosures. While certain preferred<br><br>
