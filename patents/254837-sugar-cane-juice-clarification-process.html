				<td>TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
SUGAR CANE JUICE CLARIFICATION PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to an enhanced process to clarify raw sugar<br>
cane juice by means of the use of an anionic inorganic colloid or<br>
polyacrylamide polymer, particularly together with a carbonating process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sugar cane juice is an extremely complex liquid medium, containing<br>
many organic and inorganic constituents in soluble, suspended/decantable<br>
and suspended/colloidal form. Cane sugar for human consumption is<br>
produced by means of clarification of sugar cane juice using an extraction<br>
process, which is then processed and concentrated to obtain sugar.<br>
Clarification is therefore an essential step to obtain high yields and<br>
high quality of the sugar. The clarification process needs to remove<br>
components other than sucrose and, at the same time, minimize loss of<br>
sucrose and color formation.<br>
Sulfitation is currently the most widely used process to clarify cane<br>
juice. It consists of SO2 (sulphurous anhydride) absorption by the juice,<br>
reducing its original pH to levels between 3.7 and 4.2. The use of the<br>
sulfitation process involves: (a) inhibition reactions causing color<br>
formation; (b) coagulation of suspended colloids; and (c) formation of a<br>
precipitate of CaSO3 (calcium sulfite). Furthermore, it also reduces the<br>
viscosity of the juice and consequently of the syrup, massecuites, and<br>
molasses, facilitating evaporation and baking operations.<br>
Nevertheless, the sulfitation process has problems which the<br>
sugar/alcohol industry would like to be solved, including (a) sucrose<br>
inversion due to low pH during the process; (b) potential environmental<br>
and external corrosion problems in the area, caused by any emission of<br>
SO2/SO3; (c) incrustation and corrosion of the evaporation equipment; and<br>
(d) presence of sulfite in the final sugar.<br>
Another method to clarify sugar cane juice is carbonation, which<br>
generally employs treatment with lime and controlled addition of carbon<br>
dioxide (CO2). However, this process results in (a) increase in the loss of<br>
inverted sugar in the juice (fructose and glucose) due to the high alkaline<br>
pH (generally pH of about 10) and the high temperatures used for the<br>
process, adversely affecting yield of alcohol production from the final<br>
molasses, and (b) difficulty in filtering the precipitates from clarifiers,<br>
requiring a higher investment in equipment, higher operational costs and a<br>
more complex operation.<br>
Therefore, there is a desire to have a clarification process which is<br>
superior to the sulfitation process, but which avoids the problems with<br>
carbonation. The present invention provides such a process.<br>
Silicate microgels are used in water purification and water flow<br>
processes. WO 99/61377 discloses a process to clarify water streams<br>
containing biosolids resulting from processing food and organic residues,<br>
which comprises contact of the stream with an anionic colloid, which may<br>
be a silicate microgel, and an organic polymer to flocculate the biosolids.<br>
For sugar cane juice clarification it is desired to minimize the<br>
accumulation of silica in the juice and in production heating equipment.<br>
The process of the present invention resolves this problem while avoiding<br>
the problems with the prior art sulfitation and carbonation processes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention comprises a sugar cane juice clarification process<br>
comprising at least the steps of addition of lime; addition of anionic<br>
inorganic colloid, a polyacryamide polymer, or both said colloid and said<br>
polymer; and carbonation.<br>
More specifically, the invention comprises an improved process to<br>
clarify sugar cane juice by carbonating, comprising the addition of an<br>
anionic inorganic colloid or polyacrylamide polymer, according to the<br>
following steps:<br>
a) heating of the raw sugar cane juice to be clarified;<br>
b) adding a source of lime;<br>
c) adding an anionic inorganic colloid, a polyacrylamide<br>
polymer, both the said colloid and polymer sequentially,<br>
or a mixture thereof;<br>
d) carbonating by adding carbon dioxide; and<br>
e) decanting precipitates formed to yield a supernatant<br>
containing sugar cane juice.<br>
Optionally, the addition in step c) can be after, instead before, the<br>
step d) carbonation; i.e., downstream of the carbonating step.<br>
The process optionally further comprises:<br>
a) heating of the supernatant from step e) above;<br>
b) carbonating by adding carbon dioxide; and<br>
c) decanting any precipitates formed to yield a further<br>
supernatant containing sugar cane juice.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a specific embodiment of the invention, the clarification<br>
process of the present invention comprises the steps of:<br>
a) heating of the raw sugar cane juice to be clarified;<br>
b) adding a source of lime;<br>
c) adding an anionic inorganic colloid, or a polyacrylamide<br>
polymer, or both the said colloid and polymer<br>
sequentially, or a mixture of said colloid and said<br>
polymer;<br>
d) carbonating by adding carbon dioxide; and<br>
e) decanting precipitates formed to yield a supernatant<br>
containing sugar cane juice.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides an improved process for<br>
clarifying raw sugar cane juice using carbonation wherein • the<br>
improvement comprises addition of an anionic inorganic colloid, a<br>
polyacrylamide polymer, both said colloid and polymer sequentially, or a<br>
mixture of said colloid and said polymer. The preferred anionic inorganic<br>
colloid is silicate microgel.<br>
During step a), raw sugar cane juice is heated to a temperature<br>
between about 45 °C and about 90 °C, preferably between about 50 °C<br>
and about 85 °C, and still more preferably between about 55 °C and about<br>
80 °C. Juice heating has the purpose of facilitating downstream<br>
processes by speeding up chemical reactions and improving the<br>
coagulation and sedimentation of colloids and others non-sugars.<br>
The liming step b) is the addition of a source of lime (CaO) to the<br>
raw cane juice. Any suitable source of lime can be employed, but lime<br>
milk (Ca(OH)2) or calcium saccharate are preferred. The addition of the<br>
source of lime raises the pH of the sugar cane juice. Lime is added up to<br>
a maximum concentration of about 2 % by weight of the solids content of<br>
the juice. This addition has the purpose of eliminating juice colorants,<br>
neutralizing organic acids, and forming calcium phosphate precipitate,<br>
which upon sedimentation carries with it the impurities present in the<br>
liquid.<br>
Between steps b) and c), it is particularly advantageous that a time<br>
interval of between about 0.5 and about 10 minutes is optionally observed.<br>
In step c) of the process of the present invention an anionic<br>
inorganic colloid is added. Such colloids useful in the process of this<br>
invention include silica-based anionic inorganic colloids and mixtures<br>
thereof. Silica-based anionic inorganic colloids include, but are not limited<br>
to, colloidal silica, aluminum-modified colloidal silica, polysilicate<br>
microgels, polyaluminosilicate microgels, polysilicic acid, and polysilicic<br>
acid microgels, and mixtures thereof. For those colloids containing<br>
aluminum, the aluminum can be on the surface and/or in the interior of the<br>
particles.<br>
The anionic inorganic colloids used in this invention can be in the<br>
form of a colloidal silica having an S value &gt;70%, generally &gt;75%, and<br>
containing about 2 to 60% by weight of SiO2, preferably about 4 to 30% by<br>
weight of SiO2. The colloid can have particles with at least a surface layer<br>
of aluminum silicate or it can be an aluminum modified silica sol. The<br>
alumina content of the surface-modified silica sol can be in the range of 2<br>
to 25%. The colloidal silica particles in the sols commonly have a specific<br>
surface area of 50-1200 m2/g, more preferably about 200-1000 m2/g. The<br>
silica sol can be stabilized with alkali in a molar ratio of SiO2:M2O of from<br>
10:1 to 300:1, preferably 15:1 to 100:1, and most preferably 6:1 to 12:1 (M<br>
is Na, K, Li, or NH4).<br>
Preferred for use in the process of the present invention are silicate<br>
microgels. Microgels are distinct from colloidal silica in that the microgel<br>
particles usually have surface areas of 1000 m2/g or higher and the<br>
microgels are comprised of small 1-2 nm diameter silica particles linked<br>
together into chains and three-dimensional networks. Polysilicate<br>
microgels, also known as active silicas, have SiO2:Na2O ratios of 4:1 to<br>
about 25:1, and are discussed on pages 174-176 and 225-234 of "The<br>
Chemistry of Silica" by Ralph K. Her, published by John Wiley and Sons,<br>
N. Y., 1979. Polysilicic acid generally refers to those silicic acids that have<br>
been formed and partially polymerized in the pH range 1-4 and comprise<br>
silica particles generally smaller than 4 nrn diameter, which thereafter<br>
polymerize into chains and three-dimensional networks. Polysilicic acid<br>
can be prepared in accordance with the methods disclosed in U. S.<br>
Patents 5,127,994 and 5,626,721. Polyaluminosilicates are polysilicate or<br>
polysilicic acid microgels in which aluminum has been incorporated within<br>
the particles, on the surface of the particles, or both. Polysilicate<br>
microgels, polyaluminosilicate microgels and polysilicic acid can be<br>
prepared and stabilized at acidic pH: Microgel size can be increased by<br>
any of the known methods such as of aging of the microgel, changing pH,<br>
changing concentrations, or other methods, known to those skilled in the<br>
art. The use of silicate microgels provides the advantage in the process of<br>
the present invention of reducing scaling in equipment, and therefore<br>
equipment and maintenance cleaning problems.<br>
The polysilicate microgels and polyaluminosilicate microgels useful<br>
in this invention are commonly formed by the activation of an alkali metal<br>
silicate under conditions described in U. S. Patents 4,954,220 and<br>
4,927,498. However, other methods can also be employed. For example,<br>
polyaluminosilicates can be formed by the acidification of silicate with<br>
mineral acids containing dissolved aluminum salts as described in U. S.<br>
Patent 5,482,693. Alumina/silica microgels can be formed by the<br>
acidification of silicate with an excess of alum, as described in U. S. Patent<br>
2,234,285.<br>
In addition to conventional silica sols and silica microgels, silica sols<br>
such as those described in European patents EP 491879 and EP 502089<br>
can also be used for the anionic inorganic colloid in this invention. These<br>
are commonly referred to as low "S value" sols. EP 491879 discloses a<br>
silica sol having an S value in the range of 8 to 45% wherein the silica<br>
particles have a specific surface area of 750 to 1000 m2/g, which have<br>
been surface-modified with 2 to 25% alumina. EP 502089 discloses a<br>
silica sol having a molar ratio of SiO2 to M2O, wherein M is an alkali metal<br>
ion and/or an ammonium ion of 6:1 to 12:1 and containing silica particles<br>
having a specific surface area of 700 to 1200 m2/g.<br>
Included within the scope of colloidal silica sols useful in the<br>
present invention are colloidal silica sols having a low "S value". S value<br>
is defined by ller and Dalton in J. Phys. Chem., 1956, vol. 60, pp. 955-957.<br>
S value is a measure of the degree of aggregate or microgel formation and<br>
a lower S value indicates a higher microgel content and is determined by<br>
the measure of the amount of silica, in weight percent, in the disperse<br>
phase. The disperse phase consists of particles of anhydrous silica<br>
together with any water that is immobilized at the surface or in the interior<br>
of the particles.<br>
In the process of the present invention the preferred silicate<br>
microgel is added to the mixture of sugar cane juice and lime source in<br>
step c), preferably at a quantity of between about 50 ppm and about 500<br>
ppm, more preferably from about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm. Silicate<br>
microgels are commercially available, such as Particlear® manufactured<br>
by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington DE, and are<br>
produced by any method known in the art. US Patent 6,060,523 and US<br>
Patent 6,274,112 disclose enhanced processes allowing reliable<br>
preparation of the microgels. Silicate microgel typically is obtained from<br>
sodium silicate. It is also designated as silicon dioxide microgel or active<br>
silica, comprising between about 0.5% and 2% SiO2, particularly about 1%<br>
SiOz solution.<br>
Alternatively, a polyacrylamide polymer is employed in step c) of the<br>
process of the present invention. A quantity of from about 1 ppm to about<br>
10 ppm is employed, preferably from about 2 ppm to about 5 ppm.<br>
Suitable polyacrylamide polymers for use herein include mainly anionic<br>
polymers, which carry the same charge as the particles of the suspension<br>
in raw juice. Preferred are partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides having a<br>
moderate degree of hydrolysis (between about 15% and about 40%<br>
hydrolyzed). The polymer molecular weights usually are above 1,000,000.<br>
Suitable polyacrylamides are available commercially, for example from<br>
Kemwater Brasil S.A., Sao Paulo, Brazil.<br>
The silicate microgel and polyacrylamide can both be used in the<br>
process of the present invention by adding them sequentially in any order<br>
or as a mixture. Use of the silicate microgel is preferred due to faster<br>
dewatering during filtration resulting in better filtration.<br>
Applicant has developed an enhanced carbonati ng process for<br>
cane juices, comprising the addition of an anionic inorganic colloid,<br>
preferably silicate microgel, and adjusting it to the operating conditions of<br>
a modified and improved carbonating process, thus solving the problems<br>
for its industrial implementation and permitting higher yields of purer<br>
sugar. The process of the present invention recovers the waste CO2 from<br>
fermenters and replaces SO2 currently used in the sulfitalion process for<br>
juice clarification with the recovered CO2. It also lowers scale formation in<br>
evaporators and heat-exchangers by removal of scale forming compounds<br>
from the juice through the improved clarification process. Furthermore,<br>
the process of the present invention solves the problem of filtering the<br>
precipitates/sedimentation generated by the traditional carbonation<br>
processes, and does not increase the loss of inverted sugars.<br>
Furthermore, the process of the present invention reduces the<br>
consumption of CaO in comparison with the traditional carbonation<br>
processes.<br>
The process of the present invention reduces sucrose losses by<br>
inversion, obtains better purification of the cane juice by removal of more<br>
organic and inorganic impurities, reduces corrosion of equipment due to<br>
the absence of SO2, lowers scaling in evaporators, and provides improved<br>
sugar production.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the microgel<br>
is activated by an acid, particularly from CO2, because CO2 is abundant at<br>
sugar cane processing facilities that produce ethanol by fermentation of<br>
juice and/or molasses.<br>
A time interval between step c) and the subsequent one is<br>
advantageous and this time interval is typically between 0.5 and about 10<br>
minutes.<br>
In step d), CO2 is added, preferably in sufficient quantity to form<br>
calcium carbonate precipitates. The flow of CO2 is regulated to control<br>
foaming and reaction time. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the CO2 is added through a carbonation column, in counter flow<br>
with the limed raw sugar juice source fed into the top of the column.<br>
Optionally the anionic inorganic colloid, or the polyacrylamide, or<br>
each of the former, or a mixture thereof, can be added after the<br>
carbonating step instead of prior to the carbonating step in the amounts<br>
previously disclosed.<br>
After the carbonation step, the decanting step e) is undertaken. In<br>
step e), the sugar cane juice is purified by removing precipitated impurities<br>
as solids. The decanted juice is removed from the upper part of the<br>
decanter and delivered to an evaporator, where it is concentrated. The<br>
precipitated and sedimented materials have a solid concentration of about<br>
10°Be and are usually taken from the bottom of the decanter and sent to a<br>
filtering sector where the materials are subsequently filtered to recover<br>
sugar. According to the invention, the required decanting time is less than<br>
one hour, usually about 30 minutes. The pH of the supernatant, after this<br>
first carbonation, is usually between about 8 and 10, preferably about 9.<br>
The carbonation process of the present invention is particularly<br>
advantageous when conducted using the final supernatant as the starting<br>
material in a second carbonation. Thus, the present invention further<br>
comprises a carbonation process which, in addition to the above-disclosed<br>
steps, additionally comprises the following steps:<br>
a) heating of supernatant resulting from the abovedescribed<br>
process;<br>
b) carbonating by adding carbon dioxide; and<br>
c) decanting any solids precipitated to yield a further<br>
supernatant containing sugar cane juice.<br>
During step a), the supernatant is heated at temperatures between<br>
about 60 °C and 90 °C, preferably about 70 °C. Heating is followed by a<br>
carbonation step. Operating conditions are employed which avoid<br>
excessive foam formation and generate the expected neutral pH for the<br>
juice. In a preferred embodiment, CO2 is added through a second<br>
carbonation column, in counter flow with the clarified juice fed into the top<br>
of such column. This column adjusts the final pH of the treated juice. The<br>
final pH is typically from about 6.5 to about 8, preferably about7. Any<br>
solids precipitated are decanted to yield a further supernatant containing<br>
sugar cane juice. Often there are no precipitants formed during the second<br>
carbonation.<br>
The process of the present invention as disclosed herein makes<br>
use of carbonation to clarify sugar cane juice, presenting advantages over<br>
the sulfitation process in higher yields with better quality product.<br>
The elimination of use of sulfur in the process of the present<br>
invention represents a noticeable advantage, not only in cost, but also<br>
resulting in higher process safety, lower corrosion and/or scaling of<br>
heating equipment, and less environmental degradation.<br>
Sucrose inversion in the process of the invention is reduced by<br>
between about 1.5% and 2.5%, which represents a yield increase. As a<br>
direct consequence of this aspect a higher yield in crystal sugar production<br>
is obtained using the same equipment, since sucrose forms sugar crystals<br>
and not reducing sugars. This single standard demonstrates that the<br>
process of the present invention is significantly better than those in the<br>
prior art.<br>
The process of the present invention results not only in a lower loss<br>
of sucrose, but also in higher removal of non sugars such as starches,<br>
proteins, solids in suspension and dissolved solids. The protein and<br>
starch are surprisingly reduced, typically to less than 3 ppm in the clarified<br>
juice.<br>
The process of the present invention yields purer product with<br>
better physical features such as color. The purity (Purity = POL/Brix) may<br>
increase for two different reasons: (i) higher content of sucrose (higher<br>
numerator) or (ii) lower content of non-sugars (lower denominator). Higher<br>
reduction in sucrose inversion favors further crystallization since the<br>
process will suffer less interference from impurities.<br>
The lower quantity of impurities is very desirable and benefits the<br>
whole operation, since it reduces the overall volume to be processed<br>
throughout the system. Therefore, there is less incrustation/scaling in the<br>
heating equipment, especially the evaporator, which then does not need to<br>
be cleaned so frequently. This reduces maintenance and steam energy<br>
costs and increases safety for employees who conduct such cleaning<br>
operations at the industrial facility.<br>
Furthermore, the impurity reduction provided by the process of the<br>
present invention, results in much higher sugar quality. Impurities and<br>
color (standard Icumsa (420 nm)) are reduced improving its market value.<br>
A color measure of the clarified sugar juice having a maximum of 7100,<br>
preferably a maximum of 6000, and more preferably a maximum of 5000,<br>
is attainable.<br>
Besides being a safer process with superior product, the process of<br>
the present invention provides a reduction in impurities in the juice<br>
between about 1.5% and 2.0%. For all of the above reasons, the process<br>
provides increased efficiency overall. Fewer impurities are processed<br>
under the same installed capacity, thus increasing sugar production.<br>
This increase in sugar production does not affect alcohol production<br>
from the molasses. Reducing sugars remain in the final molasses and can<br>
be converted to ethanol. Therefore, due to the reduction in sucrose<br>
inversion, there will be less final molasses for alcohol production. But, to<br>
keep the same desired levels, it is only required to deviate more raw juice<br>
to the distillery, skipping the clarification, evaporation and vacuum steps of<br>
the process.<br>
In addition to the above advantages, the process of the present<br>
invention improves the reduction of juice turbidity, reduction of organic<br>
colloids (e. g. starch), and improved coagulation and flocculation. In<br>
particular, the time to form flakes is reduced and the size of the flakes is<br>
reduced. Thus sedimentation time is reduced overall. A further<br>
advantage is the optional elimination of the addition of flocculating agents.<br>
The carbonation process of the present invention is especially<br>
advantageous for use at temperatures between about 70 °C and about<br>
80 °C, thus avoiding a negative effect on yield of alcohol production from<br>
the final molasses. Simultaneously, energy cost and decanting time are<br>
reduced. Keeping the juice at an elevated temperature leads to inversion<br>
and reducing sugar degradation to form organic acids, resulting in a<br>
decrease in purity and pH. The reduction in decanting time of the process<br>
of the invention reduces the loss of sugar by inversion.<br>
The fact that the new process generates precipitates/sediment with<br>
easier filtering characteristics than traditional carbonation is exceptionally<br>
advantageous to the sugar/alcohol industry. The sediment resulting from<br>
traditional carbonation is difficult to filter, requiring the installation of<br>
pressing filters, representing a large financial investment and a more<br>
complicated process. This is one of the main reasons why the prior art<br>
carbonation process is not more widely used. The process of the present<br>
invention generates precipitates/sediment which does not require the<br>
installation of press filters, since vacuum rotating filters can be used.<br>
Besides better filtering, the precipitates/sediment resulting from the<br>
process of the invention comprises a lower quantity of sucrose. The loss<br>
of sucrose represents less than 0.4% of the total sugar entering the plant,<br>
thus representing approximately half of the current losses. Furthermore,<br>
as opposed to traditional carbonation processes, lime consumption is<br>
much lower. It is less than 2 % by weight of solids present in the juice. In<br>
the traditional carbonation processes, the lime consumption is between 6<br>
to 10 % by weight of solids present in the juice.<br>
Thus, the process of the invention is a faster and safer process,<br>
results in a significant increase in yield, generates superior quality, and<br>
avoids the problems in the conventional carbonation process. It is useful<br>
to clarify sugar cane juice more efficiently.<br>
As the experts in the art will realize, numerous modifications and<br>
variations of the scope of the invention are possible in the light of the<br>
above teachings. It should therefore be understood that the invention can<br>
be embodied in other ways besides those specifically described herein.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Raw sugar cane juice from the past crop season typically had the<br>
following properties: pH of 5.2-5.8, turbidity of 5000, color of 10,000 to<br>
12,000 using the ICUMSA Method #4, Brix of 14 to 16, and total reducing<br>
sugars of 13 to 15.<br>
Example 1<br>
Raw sugar cane juice (I liter) was heated slowly to 80 ° C in a 2 liter<br>
beaker, followed by gradual addition of 33 ml of liming milk (calcium<br>
hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) to raise the pH to 8.5. The solution was maintained<br>
for about one (1) minute, following which was added 160ppm silica<br>
microgel available as Particlear® from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and<br>
Company, Wilmington, DE. The solution was then held for about 2<br>
minutes. The pH of the solution was kept at 8.4 via simultaneous addition<br>
of liming milk and carbon dioxide gas. Liming milk (105mL) was added to<br>
reach a total of 2% CaO by weight on solids content. The carbon dioxide<br>
was introduced at a steady rate of 260 cc/minute. Finally, the pH of the<br>
solution is lowered to 7.0 by bubbling additional carbon dioxide into the<br>
solution. Total carbonation time was 15 minutes. During carbonation,<br>
foam formation was controlled by regulating the CO2 flow rate and due to<br>
the presence of microgel. The precipitate volume (in the original<br>
carbonation beaker) was 160mL after 45 minutes of sedimentation.<br>
This was followed by a filtration step, whereby 10OmL of the<br>
concentrated precipitate was filtered in a vacuum of 58 mm Hg (7733 Pa).<br>
Filtration time for a 75 ml sample was 6 minutes, with a time to cake<br>
dryness of 8 minutes. The final pH of both the filtrate and the supernatant<br>
liquid sugar juice was 7.9. The supernatant juice and vacuum filtered<br>
juice were analyzed for pH, color, turbidity, Brix, and total reducing sugars.<br>
Excellent clarity and transparency of the juice was evident during the<br>
process. The turbidity of the final sugar juice was 16 NTU, and its color<br>
was 6436 measured using the ICUMSA method #4. The Brix was 17.8.<br>
Total reducing sugars was 16.7.<br>
Comparative Example A<br>
Sugar cane juice was processed in the mill using the sulfitation<br>
process. The juice was contacted with SO2 and liming milk (calcium<br>
hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) to form a precipitate of calcium sulfite (CaSO3). The<br>
coagulated precipitate was then separated from the supernatant. The<br>
product had a pH of 6.5, color of 9030 using ICUMSA Method #4, Brix of<br>
15.8, Total reducing sugars of 14.6, and sulfites of 150.<br>
Example 2<br>
Raw sugar cane juice was processed as in Example 1. The final<br>
product had a pH of 8, turbidity of 54 NTU, color of 7096 using the<br>
ICUMSA Method #4, Brix of 17.0 and Total reducing sugars of 16.2.<br>
Example 3<br>
Raw sugar cane juice was processed continuously in a pilot plant<br>
using 2 to 3 liters of juice per hour and running 3 to 4 hours per day using<br>
the process of the present the invention. Raw sugar cane juice was<br>
heated to 55 °C, followed by addition of liming milk (calcium hydroxide,<br>
Ca(OH)2) to raise the pH to 10.5. Liming milk consumption was about 1.2<br>
% CaO by weight on solids content. The solution was maintained for about<br>
five (5) minutes. The solution was then carbonated in a counter flow<br>
column. The carbon dioxide was introduced from the bottom, at a steady<br>
flow rate, in order to get a final carbonated juice pH of 9.5, downstream of<br>
the column. In the column, the carbonation time was 10 minutes.<br>
Following which was added 150 ppm silica microgel available as<br>
Particiear® from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE.<br>
The solution was then held for about 5 minutes. The microgel-carbonated<br>
juice was then sent to a decanter in order to separate the precipitate from<br>
the clarified juice (supernatant). Finally, the supernatant was heated up to<br>
70 °C, and the pH of this heated solution was lowered to 7.0 by bubbling<br>
additional carbon dioxide into the solution, in a second counter flow<br>
carbonation column. The precipitate from the decanter was sent for<br>
characterization and the results are given in Table 1 and 2 below.<br>
Table 1 compares the properties of the sugar juice made using the<br>
process of the present invention according to Example 3 to average<br>
results reported in the literature for carbonation processes not employing<br>
silica microgel.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Examples 4-12 and Comparative Examples A-F<br>
Carbonated materials from the process of Example 3 were filtered<br>
using 200 ml suspension volume at three different pressures as indicated<br>
in table 3 using a Bokela filter device, available from Bokela, Karlsruhe,<br>
Germany. Materials from a traditional sulfitation process were filtered<br>
under the same conditions. The material using the process of the present<br>
invention showed solids which were fiber like and formed a filter cake of<br>
16-27% solids, which was easier and faster to dewater. In contrast,<br>
material from the comparative sulfitation process formed a gel-like filter<br>
cake of about 23% solids, which was more difficult to dewater. Turbidity of<br>
the resulting sugar juice (filtrate) was about 11,000-12,000 NTU for the<br>
comparative sulfitation process and about 4,000-5,000 NTU for the<br>
process of the present invention. Specific results are listed in Table 3<br>
beiow.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Also in this case, according to above results, the material using the<br>
process of the present invention showed percent solids in the cake similar<br>
to Examples 4-6 above. However, as in the comparison with sulfitation<br>
process, the filtrate turbidity from the process of the present invention<br>
using silicate microge! or polyacrylamide was better and the filtration of the<br>
cake was easier. The process of the present invention using silicate<br>
microgel was faster to dewater. In addition, in terms of filter operation, the<br>
cake from the carbonation process of the present invention using the<br>
silicate microgel released better from the filter screen, in comparison with<br>
the other processes.<br><br><br><br><br>
