METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING EPITAXIAL WAFER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
manufacturing an epitaxial wafer that applies an etchant to<br>
a surface of a semiconductor wafer to smooth the surface,<br>
thereby improving efficiency of formation of an epitaxial<br>
layer.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, in a conventional manufacturing<br>
process for an epitaxial layer, a distal end and a proximal<br>
end of a grown silicon single crystal ingot are cut off to<br>
provide a block shape, an outer diameter of the ingot is<br>
ground in order to uniform a diameter of the ingot so that<br>
a block body can be obtained, an orientation flat or an<br>
orientation notch is formed to this block body to indicate<br>
a specific crystal orientation, and then the block body is<br>
sliced with a predeterminedl angle with respect to a rod<br>
axis direction (a step 1). A wafer peripheral portion of<br>
the sliced wafer is chamfered to avoid a crack or a chip of<br>
the wafer peripheral portion (a step 2). Subsequently,<br>
double disk surface grinding (which will be referred to as<br><br>
DDSG hereinafter) that allows both front and rear surfaces<br>
of the silicon wafer to be ground is applied as a smoothing<br>
step (a step 3). Then, single disk surface grinding (which<br>
will be referred to as SDSG hereinafter) that allows the<br>
front surface alone of the wafer to be ground or allows the<br>
front and rear surfaces of the wafer to be ground one by<br>
one is carried out (a step 4). Subsequently, double disk<br>
surface polishing (which will be referred to as DSP<br>
hereinafter) that allows both the front and rear surfaces<br>
of the wafer to be simultaneously polished is effected (a<br>
step 5). Then, single disk surface polishing (which will<br>
be referred to as SMP hereinafter) that allows the front<br>
surface alone of the wafer to be polished or allows the<br>
front and rear surfaces of the wafer to be polished one by<br>
one is carried out (a step 6). Further, when an epitaxial<br>
layer made of a silicon single crystal is formed on the<br>
surface of the wafer by epitaxial growth (a step 7), a<br>
desired epitaxial wafer can be obtained.<br>
[0003]<br>
However, the conventional manufacturing process has<br>
the following problem.<br>
When machining processing, e.g., slicing or grinding<br>
is applied, a mechanical damage or a machining scratch is<br>
necessarily formed on the wafer. Since an epitaxial layer<br>
forming step based on epitaxial growth is a process that<br>
emphasizes a scratch or a damage (a distortion of a crystal<br>
lattice) present on the wafer surface, a crystal defect,<br><br>
e.g., a dislocation or a stacking fault occurs in the<br>
epitaxial layer with a defective part caused due to<br>
machining processing such as grinding as a starting point,<br>
and this defect is elicited as a surface defect on an<br>
epitaxial layer surface in some cases. Furthermore, when a<br>
scratch or a machining damage caused due to machining<br>
processing is serious, a slip may occur in the formed<br>
epitaxial layer. Moreover, since the number of steps to<br>
manufacture an epitaxial layer is large, a throughput is<br>
reduced and a cost is increased.<br>
[0004]<br>
In order to solve this problem, there is disclosed a<br>
method for manufacturing a silicon epitaxial wafer<br>
characterized by performing a vapor growth step of growing<br>
a silicon single crystal thin film from vapor on a silicon<br>
single crystal substrate; a step of effecting water<br>
polishing; and a polishing step using an abrasive in the<br>
mentioned order (see, e.g., Patent Document 1). In this<br>
method disclosed in Patent Document 1, a silicon single<br>
crystal substrate before the vapor growth step is obtained<br>
as follows. First, a silicon single crystal ingot is cut<br>
into a block, subjected to external-diameter grinding, and<br>
then sliced. Subsequently, outer rims on both surfaces of<br>
the sliced silicon single crystal wafer are chamfered, and<br>
then both the surfaces are lapped by using a loose abrasive.<br>
The lapping wafer is immersed in an etchant to chemically<br>
etch both the surfaces, thereby obtaining a chemically<br><br>
etched wafer. This chemically etched wafer is determined<br>
as the silicon single crystal substrate, and a silicon<br>
single crystal thin film is grown from vapor on this<br>
substrate. In the method disclosed in Patent Document 1,<br>
occurrence of a scratch defect due to a protruding defect<br>
formed on the surface of the vapor-grown silicon single<br>
crystal thin film can be suppressed, and a height of this<br>
protruding defect can be reduced.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Examined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2002-43255 (claim 1, paragraphs<br>
[0006] and [0013] to [0015])<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in the manufacturing method disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 1, since immersion type etching is carried<br>
out, an entire wafer surface is uniformly etched, control<br>
over a removal amount in a wafer plane to effect shape<br>
control, e.g., obtaining a predetermined surface shape<br>
cannot be performed in a wafer plane, and hence a surface<br>
state, e.g., a flatness degree is hard to be improved even<br>
though it may become worse before lapping/grinding at the<br>
previous step. Further, smoothing processing based on<br>
machining, e.g., lapping is applied before vapor growth of<br>
the silicon single crystal thin film, a mechanical damage<br>
or a processing scratch necessarily occurs on the wafer,<br><br>
and occurrence of a surface defect or a slip formed on an<br>
epitaxial layer cannot be sufficiently reduced even though<br>
subsequent water polishing or polishing using an abrasive<br>
is applied.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for manufacturing an epitaxial layer that applies an<br>
etchant to a surface of a semiconductor wafer to smooth the<br>
surface, thereby reducing occurrence of a surface defect or<br>
a slip formed on an epitaxial layer.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM<br>
[0006]<br>
The present inventors have revealed that performing a<br>
smoothing step of applying an etchant to a silicon wafer<br>
under specific conditions or an epitaxial layer forming<br>
step allows reducing occurrence of a surface defect or a<br>
slip formed on an epitaxial layer.<br>
The present invention provides a method for<br>
manufacturing an epitaxial layer comprising: a smoothing<br>
step of controlling application of an etchant in accordance<br>
with a surface shape of a silicon wafer to smooth the wafer<br>
surface; and an epitaxial layer forming step of forming an<br>
epitaxial layer formed of a silicon single crystal on the<br>
surface of the wafer based on epitaxial growth.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]<br><br>
The method for manufacturing an epitaxial layer<br>
according to the present invention can demonstrate an<br>
effect that controlling application of an etchant to a<br>
wafer surface in accordance with a shape of the wafer<br>
surface allows smoothing the wafer surface. Furthermore,<br>
since the smoothing processing for the wafer surface is<br>
chemical processing that applies an etchant to the wafer<br>
without including a mechanical element and a scratch or a<br>
damage rarely occurs on the wafer, occurrence of a surface<br>
defect or a slip formed on an epitaxial layer due to<br>
machining can be decreased.<br>

BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
The best mode for carrying out the present invention<br>
will now be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
First, a distal end and a proximal end of a grown<br>
silicon single crystal ingot are cut off to provide a block<br>
shape, and an external diameter of the ingot is ground to<br>
uniform a diameter of the ingot, thereby providing a block<br>
body. An orientation flat or an orientation notch is<br>
formed to this block body to indicate a specific crystal<br>
orientation. After this process, as shown in FIG. 1, the<br>
block body is sliced with a predetermined angle with<br>
respect to a rod axis direction (a step 11).<br>
[0011]<br>
Irregular layers on front and rear surfaces of a thin<br>
discoid silicon wafer produced in a process such as slicing<br>
are ground down by machining, e.g., grinding or lapping to<br>
enhance a flatness degree of the front and rear surfaces of<br>
the wafer and a parallelism degree of the wafer in a<br>
conventional manufacturing process for a wafer, but in a<br>
manufacturing method according to this embodiment, this<br><br>
smoothing step based on machining is not performed, and<br>
application of an etchant is first controlled in accordance<br>
with a silicon wafer surface shape after slicing, whereby<br>
the wafer surface is smoothed (a step 12) .<br>
[0012]<br>
At the smoothing step 12, irregular layers on both<br>
front and rear surfaces of the silicon wafer produced at a<br>
step of, e.g., slicing are smoothed by etching to enhance a<br>
flatness degree of the front and rear surfaces of the wafer<br>
and a parallelism degree of the wafer. Furthermore, an<br>
affected layer introduced due to a machining process, e.g.,<br>
block cutting, external-diameter grinding, or the slicing<br>
step 11 is completely removed. Moreover, the use of an<br>
acid etchant as an etchant utilized in smoothing allows<br>
controlling surface roughness of the wafer.<br>
[0013]<br>
This smoothing step 12 is carried out by using such an<br>
etching device 20 as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
The single-wafer processing etching device 20 depicted<br>
in FIG. 4 has a stage 22 that supports a wafer 21, and a<br>
rotation driving source 24, e.g., a motor that is connected<br>
with the stage 22 via a rotary shaft 23 and drives the<br>
stage 22 to rotate through the rotary shaft 23, and these<br>
members constitute wafer rotating means 25.<br>
[0014]<br>
Moreover, the single-wafer processing etching device<br>
20 has etchant supplying means 26 for supplying an etchant,<br><br>
a nozzle 27 that receives the etchant from this etchant<br>
supplying means 26 and belches out the etchant to the wafer<br>
21, a nozzle base portion 28 that movably supports this<br>
nozzle 27, and a guide portion 29 that restricts a<br>
position/movement of the nozzle base portion 28, and these<br>
members constitute nozzle position controlling means 30.<br>
To the nozzle base portion 28 are provided a mechanism that<br>
adjusts an angle of the nozzle 27 with respect to the<br>
nozzle base portion 28, a mechanism that adjusts a height<br>
position of a distal end of the nozzle 27 from the wafer 21,<br>
and a mechanism that switches discharge/non-discharge of<br>
the etchant from the nozzle 27, and these members<br>
constitute discharge state controlling means 31.<br>
[0015]<br>
Additionally, the single-wafer processing etching<br>
device 20 has controlling means 32 that controls the number<br>
of revolutions of the rotation driving source 24 to set a<br>
water revolution number, controls the etchant supplying<br>
means 26 to specify a supply state of the etchant, and<br>
controls the nozzle position controlling means 30 and the<br>
discharge state controlling means 31 to set a state/a<br>
position of the nozzle 27. This controlling means 32 has<br>
an arithmetic portion 33, e.g., a CPU and a plurality of<br>
memories 34, 35.... Reference numeral 36 denotes wafer<br>
surface detecting means that utilizes laser reflection on<br>
the wafer surface based on a laser reflection mode to<br>
measure irregularities on the wafer surface. The detecting<br><br>
means 36 may measure a wafer surface shape as an<br>
independent device without being disposed in the single-<br>
wafer processing etching device 20.<br>
[0016]<br>
The etchant supplying means 26 supplies an acid<br>
etchant to the nozzle 27. The etchant supplying means 26<br>
may previously mix acids at a predetermined mixing ratio to<br>
prepare the acid etchant and then supply the acid etchant<br>
to the nozzle 31, or it may separately supply acids to the<br>
nozzle 31 and then mix them near the nozzle 31.<br>
In the nozzle position controlling means 30, the guide<br>
portion 29 that restricts movement of the nozzle base<br>
portion 28 runs through a rotational center of the wafer 21<br>
and supports the nozzle base portion 28 so that the nozzle<br>
27 can move in a radial direction of the wafer 21. The<br>
guide portion 29 may have a configuration by which the<br>
nozzle base portion 28 can move in a length direction<br>
thereof. A position of the nozzle 27 with respect to the<br>
rotational center of the wafer 21 can be set based on a<br>
movement position of the nozzle base portion 28 in the<br>
length direction of the guide portion 29. The nozzle base<br>
portion 2 8 has a mechanism that moves in the length<br>
direction of the guide portion 29.<br>
[0017]<br>
Further, the guide portion 29 may have a structure in<br>
which one end thereof is provided to run through the<br>
rotational center of the wafer 21 whilst the other end<br><br>
thereof is supported to be rotatable in a horizontal<br>
direction and the nozzle 27 that moves when the guide<br>
portion 29 is horizontally swiveled can move in an in-plane<br>
direction of the wafer 21.<br>
The discharge state controlling means 31 has angle<br>
adjusting means that is provided at the nozzle base portion<br>
28 and adjusts an angle of the nozzle 27 with respect to<br>
the nozzle base portion 28, height adjusting means for<br>
adjusting a height position of the distal end of the nozzle<br>
27 from the wafer 21, and a valve body that switches<br>
discharge/non-discharge of the etchant from the nozzle 27.<br>
Furthermore, supply from the etchant supplying means 26 may<br>
be switched without providing the valve body.<br>
[0018]<br>
The controlling means 32 has at least a memory that<br>
stores a surface shape of the wafer 21 before processing, a<br>
memory that stores a position of the nozzle 27 and an<br>
etching state, a memory that stores a discharge amount of<br>
the etchant and an etching state, and a memory that stores<br>
a shape of the wafer 21 serving as a reference after<br>
processing as the memories 34, 35 ..., and has the<br>
arithmetic portion 33 that calculates these contents to<br>
obtain movement of the nozzle 27 and a discharge state of<br>
the etchant. It is to be noted that the memories 34 and 35<br>
use the detecting means 36 to detect a surface status of<br>
the wafer 21 before processing, and store this data.<br>
Incidentally, in regard to this memory data, the detecting<br><br>
means may detect a surface status in accordance with each<br>
wafer to be processed and resultant data may be stored, or<br>
the detecting means may detect a surface status every given<br>
number of wafers on behalf of other wafers and resultant<br>
data may be stored, or a convex portion of a given wafer<br>
may be detected in accordance with each ingot, or data<br>
defined in accordance with each category of wafers may be<br>
used.<br>
[0019]<br>
In order to smooth the wafer 21 in the single-wafer<br>
processing etching device 20 according to this embodiment,<br>
the detecting means 36 is first used to divide a surface of<br>
the wafer 21 into a plurality of regions and measure a<br>
surface shape, this detection data is input to the<br>
controlling means 32 for controlling a shape of the wafer<br>
21, and this detection data is stored in the memories 34<br>
and 35.<br>
Then, the wafer 21 is supported on the stage 22, and<br>
the rotation driving source 24 drives this stage 22 to<br>
rotate under control by the controlling means 32.<br>
Furthermore, the controlling means 32 allows the<br>
etchant supplying means 26 to supply an etchant having a<br>
predetermined composition to the nozzle 27, controls the<br>
nozzle position controlling means 30 and the discharge<br>
state controlling means 31 to control a state/a position<br>
and a discharge time of the nozzle 27 so that the etchant<br>
is belched out to the wafer 21.<br><br>
[0020]<br>
Horizontal movement of the nozzle 27 is carried out by<br>
oscillation along an arc described by horizontal driving<br>
over the nozzle 27 in a radial direction of the wafer from<br>
the wafer center at a speed of approximately 0.1 to 20<br>
mm/second with an end of the nozzle 27 being determined as<br>
a supporting point, or carried out by reciprocation in the<br>
radial direction of the wafer from the wafer center. The<br>
etchant supplied to an upper surface of the wafer 21<br>
gradually moves from a water center side toward a wafer<br>
outer rim side by a centrifugal force of rotation of the<br>
wafer while etching an affected layer on the wafer surface,<br>
and scatters as droplets from the outer rim of the wafer.<br>
[0021]<br>
The etchant used at the smoothening step 12 is an<br>
aqueous solution containing hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid,<br>
and phosphoric acid. Moreover, a mixing ratio of<br>
hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid<br>
contained in the aqueous solution is defined as<br>
hydrofluoric acid:nitric acid:phosphoric acid=0.5 to 40%:5<br>
to 50%:5 to 70% in weight%. When this mixing ratio is<br>
adopted, a viscosity degree of the etchant becomes 2 to 40<br>
mPa.sec and a surface tension of the etchant becomes 50 to<br>
70 dyne/cm, and hence this is preferable to improve<br>
flatness degrees of front and rear surfaces of the wafer<br>
and a parallelism degree of the wafer. When the viscosity<br>
degree is less than a lower limit value, the viscosity of<br><br>
the liquid is too low, the etchant that has dropped onto<br>
the upper surface of the wafer is immediately blown out<br>
from the wafer surface by the centrifugal force, and the<br>
etchant cannot uniformly and sufficiently come into contact<br>
with the wafer surface, whereby assuring a sufficient<br>
etching removal amount takes time, resulting in a reduction<br>
in productivity. When the viscosity degree exceeds an<br>
upper limit value, the etchant that has dropped onto the<br>
wafer surface stays on the wafer supper surface for a long<br>
time beyond necessity, and hence an in-plane and an outer<br>
peripheral shapes of the wafer cannot be controlled,<br>
resulting in an inconvenience of deterioration in the wafer<br>
flatness degree. When the surface tension is less than the<br>
lower limit value, the etchant that has dropped onto the<br>
wafer upper surface is immediately blown out from the wafer<br>
surface by the centrifugal force, it cannot uniformly and<br>
sufficiently come into contact with the wafer surface,<br>
whereby assuring a sufficient etching removal amount takes<br>
time, resulting in a reduction in productivity. When the<br>
surface tension exceeds an upper limit value, the etchant<br>
that has dropped onto the wafer surface stays on the wafer<br>
upper surface for a long time beyond necessity, and hence<br>
an in-plane and an outer peripheral shapes of the wafer<br>
cannot be controlled, resulting in an inconvenience of<br>
deterioration in the wafer flatness degree. As a mixing<br>
ratio of hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
and water contained in the etchant, 5 to 20%:20 to 40%:20<br><br>
to 40%:20 to 40% is preferable. When this mixing ratio is<br>
adopted, a viscosity degree of the etchant becomes 10 to 20<br>
mPa.sec and a surface tension of the etchant becomes 55 to<br>
60 dyne/cm. As a supply amount of the etchant from the<br>
nozzle 27, 2 to 30 liters/minute is preferable. 5 to 30<br>
liters/minute is preferable as a supply amount of the acid<br>
etchant when a width of the silicon wafer is <j mm and></j>
to 20 liters/minute is preferable as a supply amount of the<br>
acid etchant when a width of the silicon wafer is 4»200 mm.<br>
[0022]<br>
A rotating speed of the wafer 21 at the smoothing step<br>
12 is defined to fall within a range of approximately 100<br>
to 2000 rpm. It is to be noted that an optimum rotating<br>
speed slightly varies depending on a diameter of the wafer<br>
21, a viscosity degree of the etchant, a supply position of<br>
the etchant based on horizontal movement of the nozzle 27,<br>
or a supply flow rate of the etchant to be supplied. When<br>
the rotating speed is less than a lower limit value, an in-<br>
plane and an outer peripheral shapes of the wafer cannot be<br>
controlled to result in an inconvenience of deterioration<br>
in a wafer flatness degree and, when the rotating speed exceeds an upper limit value, the etchant that has dropped<br>
onto the wafer surface is immediately blown out from the<br>
wafer surface by the centrifugal force, and it cannot<br>
uniformly and sufficiently come into contact with the wafer<br>
surface, whereby assuring a sufficient etching removal<br>
amount takes time, reducing productivity. When a width of<br><br>
the silicon wafer is 
1500 rpm is preferable, and 600 rpm is more preferable.<br>
When a width of the silicon wafer is ϕ200 mm, a rotating<br>
speed of 300 to 2000 rpm is preferable, and 800 rpm is more<br>
preferable.<br>
[0023]<br>
Moreover, at this smoothing step 12, when one surface<br>
of the wafer is etched and then the other surface of the<br>
wafer is etched, a parallelism degree of the wafer required<br>
to evenly etch both the front and rear surfaces of the<br>
wafer can be enhanced. After etching one surface of the<br>
wafer 21, the wafer 21 is spun while supplying a rinse<br>
agent, e.g., pure water to the upper surface of the wafer<br>
21 from a non-illustrated rinse agent supply nozzle so that<br>
the etchant remaining on the surface of the wafer 21 is<br>
removed. After cleaning, in a state where supply of the<br>
rinse agent is stopped, the wafer 21 is spun to be dried<br>
while supplying an inert gas, e.g., a nitrogen gas.<br>
Subsequently, the wafer 21 is turned over, the wafer 21 is<br>
held on the stage 22 in such a manner that the surface of<br>
the wafer 21 that has not been subjected to<br>
etching/cleaning/drying processing becomes an upper surface,<br>
and etching processing, rinse agent cleaning processing,<br>
and drying processing are likewise carried out.<br>
[0024]<br>
In regard to an etching removal amount at this<br>
smoothing step 12, 10 to 150 urn is preferable as a total<br><br>
removal amount of the front and rear surfaces of the wafer,<br>
wherein 5 to 75 µm is a removal amount for one surface.<br>
When the etching removal amount is set to fall within this<br>
range, a flatness degree of the front and rear surfaces of<br>
the wafer and a parallelism degree of the wafer can be<br>
enhanced. Additionally, at steps following this smoothing<br>
step 12, when mirror polishing is applied, a polishing<br>
removal amount at a mirror polishing step can be greatly<br>
reduced as compared with that in a conventional wafer<br>
manufacturing process. When the etching removal amount is<br>
less than a lower limit value, a flatness degree of the<br>
front and rear surfaces of the wafer and a parallelism<br>
degree of the wafer required as a product cannot be<br>
obtained, wafer surface roughness cannot be sufficiently<br>
reduced and, when the etching removal amount exceeds an<br>
upper limit value, the wafer flatness degree is<br>
deteriorated, and productivity in wafer manufacture is<br>
degraded. When the smoothing step 12 is carried out under<br>
the above-described conditions, a high flatness degree can<br>
be achieved without effecting a smoothing step using<br>
machining based on grinding or the like that is a necessary<br>
step in the conventional wafer manufacturing process.<br>
[0025]<br>
It is to be noted that the example where the smoothing<br>
step using machining based on, e.g., lapping or grinding is<br>
omitted has been explained in conjunction with this<br>
embodiment, but the sliced wafer may be subjected to<br><br>
lapping processing or surface grinding processing before<br>
the smoothing step 12 depending on the wafer shape after<br>
slicing in order to reduce a throughput per wafer, e.g., an<br>
etching use amount at the smoothing step 12. Even in this<br>
case, performing the smoothing step 12 allows reducing<br>
occurrence of a surface defect or a slip formed on an<br>
epitaxial layer due to machining.<br>
[0026]<br>
Subsequently, an epitaxial layer formed of a silicon<br>
single crystal is formed on the surface of the wafer by<br>
epitaxial growth (a step 13). It is preferable for the<br>
epitaxial layer to be formed by a CVD method in view of<br>
crystallinity or mass productivity thereof, simplicity of a<br>
device, easiness of forming various kinds of device<br>
structures, and others. Epitaxial growth of silicon by the<br>
CVD method is carried out by introducing a raw material gas<br>
containing silicon, e.g., SiCl4, SiHCl3, SiH2Cl2, or SiH4<br>
together with an H2 gas into a reactor and precipitating on<br>
the surface of the wafer silicon generated by thermal<br>
decomposition or reduction of the raw material gas.<br>
[0027]<br>
Controlling application of an etchant to the wafer<br>
surface in accordance with a shape of the wafer surface in<br>
this manner enables accurately smoothing the wafer surface<br>
and, since the smoothing processing for the wafer surface<br>
is chemical processing of applying an etchant to the wafer<br>
without including a mechanical element, occurrence of a<br><br>
surface defect or a slip formed on the epitaxial layer due<br>
to machining can be reduced while causing almost no scratch<br>
or damage on the wafer. The epitaxial wafer can be<br>
obtained in accordance with this embodiment, wherein a<br>
difference between a maximum value of a wafer thickness and<br>
a minimum value of the same is not greater than 1 µm when<br>
an entire surface of the wafer is measured.<br>
[0028]<br>
Further, according to this embodiment, it is<br>
preferable to further include a mirror polishing step 14<br>
between the smoothing step 12 and the epitaxial layer<br>
forming step 13 as shown in FIG. 2, or after the epitaxial<br>
layer forming step 13 as shown in FIG. 3. Furthermore,<br>
since etching as chemical processing is carried out at the<br>
smoothing step 12, a grinding mark or undulation generated<br>
by effecting mechanical smoothing processing such as<br>
grinding is not produced, and hence much polishing removal<br>
amount does not have to be taken at the mirror polishing<br>
step 14, thus reducing the polishing removal amount. As<br>
compared with a conventional manufacturing method, a<br>
surface quality can be improved, and occurrence of a<br>
surface defect can be further suppressed. The mirror<br>
polishing step 14 may be a step based on SMP of polishing<br>
the front and rear surfaces of the wafer one by one or a<br>
step based on DSP of simultaneously polishing the front and<br>
rear surfaces of the wafer. Moreover, in order to improve<br>
micro-roughness of a wafer main surface on which a device<br><br>
is formed, SMP may be carried out with respect to the main<br>
surface of the wafer subjected to DSP. When performing the<br>
mirror polishing 14 between the smoothing step 12 and the<br>
epitaxial layer forming step 13, a polishing removal amount<br>
that is not smaller than 0.01 µm but not greater than 5 µm<br>
per surface is preferable or a polishing removal amount<br>
that is not smaller than 0.1 µm but not greater than 1 µm<br>
is more preferable per surface in SMP. Additionally, in<br>
DSP, a polishing removal amount that is not smaller than<br>
0.5 µm but not greater than 20 µm is preferable or a<br>
polishing removal amount that is not smaller than 0.5 µM<br>
but not greater than 15 µm is more preferable as a total<br>
polishing removal amount on both the front and rear<br>
surfaces. Further, when performing DSP after the epitaxial<br>
layer forming step 13, a polishing removal amount that is<br>
not smaller than 0.02 µm but not greater than 1 µm is<br>
preferable or a polishing removal amount that is not<br>
smaller than 0.1 µm but not greater than 0.5 µm is more<br>
preferable as a total polishing removal amount on both the<br>
front and rear surfaces.<br>
[0029]<br>
It is to be noted that a cleaning step may be of<br>
course provided before or after each step in this<br>
embodiment. Furthermore, as cleaning after the smoothing<br>
step 12 and before the epitaxial layer forming step 13, it<br>
is particularly preferable to perform cleaning using a<br>
cleaning fluid having an oxidation reducing effect and then<br><br>
carry out cleaning using a hydrofluoric acid solution in<br>
order to efficiently remove a remaining ion.<br>

Examples according to the present invention will now<br>

obtaining an epitaxial wafer.<br>

carried out. A polishing removal amount based on this SMP<br>
was 0.5 µm on one surface, and a total polishing removal<br>
amount was 1.0 µm on both the front and rear surfaces.<br>
[0033]<br><comparative example><br>
A silicon wafer of ϕ300 mm cut out from a silicon<br>
single crystal ingot was first prepared. Then, as a<br>
smoothing step, a non-illustrated grinder was used to<br>
perform double disk surface grinding (which will be<br>
referred to as DDSG hereinafter) with respect to front and<br>
rear surfaces of the silicon wafer. A removal amount at<br>
this DDSG step was 30 µm on one surface. Subsequently, the<br>
non-illustrated grinder was used to perform a single disk<br>
surface grinding step (which will be referred to as a SDSG<br>
step hereinafter), and a removal amount at this SDSG step<br>
was 20 µm on one surface.<br>
Then, DSP of simultaneously polishing the front and<br>
rear surfaces of the wafer was effected. A polishing<br>
removal amount based on this DSP was 10 µm. on one surface,<br>
and a total polishing removal amount was 20 µm on both the<br>
front and rear surfaces. Subsequently, SMP of polishing<br><br>
the front and rear surfaces of the wafer one by one was<br>
carried out. A polishing removal amount based on this SMP<br>
was 0.5 µm on one surface, and a total polishing removal<br>
amount was 1.0 µm on both the front and rear surfaces.<br>
Additionally, an epitaxial layer formed of a silicon single<br>
crystal was formed with a thickness of 2 µm on the surface<br>
of the wafer by epitaxial growth, thereby obtaining an<br>
epitaxial wafer.<br>
[0034]<br><comparative test><br>
A particle measuring device (SP1 manufactured by KLA-<br>
Tencor Corporation) was used to measure each particle that<br>
is present on the wafer surface and equal to or above 0.09<br>
µm with respect to the epitaxial wafer obtained by each of<br>
Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example 1. FIGS. 5 to 8<br>
show its result.<br>
[0035]<br>
As apparent from FIGS. 5 to 8, 9 particles were<br>
measured per wafer in Example 1, 11 particles were measured<br>
per wafer in Example 2, 10 particles were measured per<br>
wafer in Example 3, and 29 particles were measured per<br>
wafer in Comparative Example 1, respectively. In the<br>
wafers according to Examples 1 to 3, there is no large<br>
difference in surface defect density irrespective of a<br>
wafer that was not subjected to mirror polishing or a wafer<br>
that was subjected to mirror polishing, and hence excellent<br>
results were obtained. On the other hand, in Comparative<br><br>
Example 1, although a large defect like a slip was not<br>
observed, it was revealed that there is a difference in<br>
surface defective density when microscopically compared.<br>
[0036]<br><comparative test><br>
A non-contact surface roughness meter (MP3100<br>
manufactured by Chapman) was used to measure wafer surface<br>
roughness with respect to the epitaxial wafer obtained by<br>
each of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example 1. Table 1<br>
shows its result.<br>
[0037]<br><br>
[0038]<br>
As apparent from Table 1, in the wafer according to<br>
Example 1 formed without the smoothing step based on<br>
machining, a result of the surface roughness smaller than<br>
that of the wafer according to Comparative Example 1 as a<br>
conventional method was obtained. Further, in each of the<br>
wafer according to Example 2 and the wafer according to<br>
Example 3 subjected to mirror polishing, the surface<br>
roughness is smaller than that of the wafer according to<br>
Example 1 that was not subjected to mirror polishing, and<br><br>
it was revealed that an excellent result can be obtained<br>
when mirror polishing is carried out.<br>
[0039]<br>
Comparative Test 3&gt;<br>
The epitaxial wafer obtained in each of Examples 1 to<br>
3 and Comparative Example 1 was imaged based on X-ray<br>
topography. FIGS. 9 and 12 show obtained topographs.<br>
[0040]<br>
As apparent from FIGS. 9 to 12, a large defect, e.g.,<br>
a slip or a dislocation that can be observed based on X-ray<br>
topography was not observed in all the epitaxial wafers<br>
according to Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example 1.<br>
