TITLE<br><br>
A NOVEL FORMULATION OF<br>
N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl) methauesulfonamide )<br>
APPLICANT<br>
DR. DINESH SHANTILAL PATEL, an Indian national,<br>
Of 11/12 Udyognagar, S.V. Road, Goregaon (West), Mumbai - 400 104,<br>
State of Maharashtra, and SHASHIKANT PRABHUDAS KURANI, an<br>
Indian national, of 11/12 Udyognagar, S.V. Road, Goregaon (West),<br>
Mumbai - 400 104, State of Maharashtra.<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
31 MAY 1999                                     18-10-2007<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel therapeutic composition. More particularly the composition comprises N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide (Nimesuhde) with 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol,which is in the form of injectables both intravenous and intramuscular, as well as in the form of oral liquid composition and liquid preparation for topical applications and to a process for preparing such compositions.<br>
Nimesuhde which has the chemical name N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl)methane-sulfonamide (Nimesuhde) has the following chemical formula:<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
Nimesuhde preparations are used for analgesic applications in the form of tablet, suspension, ointment and intramuscular preparations.<br>
The poor solubility of Nimesuhde in aqueous media, restricts the use of the substance in analgesic compositions through the injectable format or for preparation of compositions with various ingredients in oral preparations or its use for local applications. The preparation of such formulations in oil base leads to various problems eg., injectables are difficult to filter; when administered intramuscularly because it results in pain and depot formation and therefore unsuitable for intravenous use. The various castor oil derivatives when used internally may give anaphylactic reactions and defy the object of quick relief.<br><br><br>
US Patent no. 5,688,829 describes the preparation of Nimesulide for therapeutic use in the form of intramuscular injectables. The patent describes the use of a number of vehicles like dimethyl acetamide, benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol and ethyl oleate in various proportions thus involving more than one ingredient, which in turn requires substantial quality checks for individual ingredients and stabilizers. The use of such solutions for intravenous purposes is limited due to certain characteristics of the product.<br>
The salt of Nimesulide is not frequently used as such since such solution, in the aqueous phase, gives very high alkaline pH, not homeostatically proper for injectable preparations.<br>
WO 95/34533 describes the injectable preparation of Nimesulide as complex formed with L-lysine. This also has limitations in terms of use eg., to achieve high therapeutic efficacy, higher quantities of the formulation is to be administered or a dose given intramuscularly would be of sub-therapeutic level if given through normal intramuscular route.<br>
The inherent drawbacks of Nimesulide makes it unsuitable for use in intravenous as well as in the form of clear transparent preparations of syrups and drops.<br>
Therefore there is still a need for a stable, dose-flexible analgesic / anti-inflammatory / anti-pyretic formulation / solution which can be conveniently filtered, sterilized and free from all limitations of oil based formulation and its ingredients.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
A pharmaceutical composition, especially suitable for application intravenously or intramuscularly or topically, comprising:<br>
N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide      and   2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol.<br>
The applicants have now found that a formulation in the form of injectables, oral liquids viz., syrups &amp; drops, lotions, creams and ointments can be provided when N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide (Nimesulide) is dissolved in 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol.<br>
This solution, in its injectable form, can be conveniently administered intravenously with flexibility of dose as per the need of the patient<br><br><br>
It is a clear, limpid solution which is stable, safe and as effective as the present marketed<br>
formulation.<br>
The applicants have also found a suitable process for the preparation of the new<br>
formulation whereby the formulation may be prepared at a cheaper cost. The process of<br>
the invention is also simple.<br>
Alternatively    the    formulation    can    be    prepared    by / solving \ N-(4-Nitro-2-<br>
Phenoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide (Nimesulide) in 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-<br>
D-glucitol- water mixture.<br>
Alternatively the compositions may also contain vehicles and adjuvants such as diluting<br>
agents, sweetners, buffering agents, flavouring agents, stabilizers and the like.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the said therapeutic<br>
composition which comprises -<br>
mixing of N-(4-Nitro-2-Phenoxyphenyl)methanesulfonamide  (Nimesulide) with 2,5-di-<br>
0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-itolunde istirring and heating;	<br>
cooling the mixture and recovering the solution.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The solutions of Nimesulide may be administered either through intravenous or intramuscular manner. The analgesic efficacy is maximum when the drug level is sufficiently distributed to reach therapeutic levels after absorption and the use of the composition of the invention achieves this when administered intravenously or intramuscularly. The dosage can be flexible in various concentrations from 25 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml and the same is non-toxic. This may be provided in the form of single dose or multiple dose as per the requirement of physicians.<br>
The composition according to the invention is also suitable for various oral formulations and for topical application. The solvent used in the formulation is easily water soluble, versatile and non-toxic at the level of applicable use. It thus reduces cost, with improved efficacy over the presently available oral preparations.<br><br>
Moreover the side effects like gastric irritation, shown by oral preparations, can be reduced if the formulation of the present invention is administered in either injectable form or as paediatric drops or as oral liquid form by incorporating necessary diluents of formulation.<br>
The composition may be prepared as an injection with a solvent which is ready to be used in a single / multi dose vial, therapeutically usable specifically for debiliated Geriatric and Paediatric patients. However this does not limit its use to only the above category of patients and can be used in various other categories too where, instantaneous, quick effects with high therapeutic index, without the limitations of oral / suppository route, are required. The oral dose in humans is 100 mg given twice or 5 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses with onset of action within 30-60 minutes and this action lasts for 8-10 hours. For topical application of the compostion, gel may be prepared using carbopol and 1% alcohol.<br>
In the present invention, solution formulations of 25 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml - prepared with or without antioxidant - have been made, which can be administered intramuscularly / intravenously or for formulating oral liquids which give a maximum peak threshold level for reducing pain thus having best analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory effect. The advantage is 'rapid onset of action' as time is the critical factor for 'relief from conditions like pain, temperature, etc.<br>
The examples are illustrative and non-limiting and using the teachings of the invention, derivatives of Nimesulide can also be prepared in this versatile and elegant solvent. The solvent is readily miscible in water. The dose up to 100 mg/ml of Nimesulide and its analogues can be prepared in 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4.3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. The same solvent may be used for preparation of 1% gel.<br>
This invention will now be illustrated in the Examples to follow illustrating the preparation of Nimesulide in carrier solvent 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol and a mix of 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol / water which gives safe, effective, economic, easy to prepare solution either used as injectables for intramuscular / intravenous route and for oral preparations as drops and syrups.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example I:<br>
8.10872 mmol of Nimesulide is taken in a round bottom flask containing 50 ml. of 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. With arrangement of stirring and heating, the temperature of vessel is maintained at 40°C with continuous stirring continued up to 1 hour under Nitrogen. Reaction mixture is brought to 25°C and volume of preparation is made to 100 ml. with 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. This solution is filtered aseptically using a 0.2 micron filter, filled and sealed in amber vials for the preparation of injectables. The clear liquid can be utilized for the preparation of oral liquids and paediatric drops by incorporating diluting agents, sweeteners, buffering agents, flavouring agents and stabilizers.<br>
Example II:<br>
32.43 mmol Nimesulide is taken in a round bottom flask containing 50 ml. 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol with an arrangement of stirring and nitrogen flushing. The mixture is stirred at 40°C for 45 mins. The mixture is cooled to 25°C and volume of the resultant solution is made to 100 ml. The solution is filtered through Millipore 0.2 micron filter and then filled and sealed in amber vials for injections and some can be used for preparing drops and oral liquids by incorporating necessary vehicles and adjuvants like diluents, sweeteners, flavouring agents and stabilizers.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE - III:<br>
8.1072 mmol of Nimesulide is taken in a 100 ml. round bottom flask with 50 ml. of 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. The solution is maintained at 60°C. With continuous stirring, 15 ml. of injection grade double distilled water is added and further stirring is carried out. 0.7 mmol chlorocresol is added with continuous stirring to dissolve and solution is brought to room temperature. The volume of final solution is made to 100 ml with 2,5-di-0-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. The pH of solution is measured potentiometrically using glass calomel electrode and is about 6. The solution is filtered through millipore filter 0.2 micron aseptically and then filled and sealed under nitrogen in amber vials.<br>
Omitting the addition of chlorocresol and by incorporating necessary diluents like sugar, buffering agents and flavouring agents, paediatric drops and oral liquids can be prepared.<br>
EXAMPLE - IV;<br>
16.21 mmol of Nimesulide is taken in a flask containing 50 ml of 2,5-di-O-methyl-1,4.3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol appended with stirring mechanism. Stirred for 45 mins. at 60°C and then to the solution, 15 ml. of double distilled water is added. With continuous stirring, 0.7mmol chlorocresol is added, allowed to dissolve and after its solubilization, the mixture is brought to room temperature and made to 100 ml. with 2,5-di-O-methyl-l,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol. The solution is filtered through 0.2micron filter aseptically and then filled and sealed in amber vials.<br>
Omitting the addition of chlorocresol and by incorporating necessary diluents like sugar, buffering agents and flavouring agents, paediatric drops and oral liquids can be prepared.<br>

Thus it is seen that the prepared solutions, in the various strengths of 25 mg/ml., 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, which can be given either in single dose or multi-dose as injections or solution used for preparation of oral liquids are very stable. Various diluents like water up to 15% V/v may be used. Formulations are stable when tested by stability indicating Spectro method.<br>
The efficacy of the solution preparation, as an anti-inflammatory agent in animal models was studied and it was found to be more quickly effective than the oral Nimesulide preparations.<br><br><br>
