Description<br>
METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROCESSING PoC CALL<br>
BASED ON ANSWER MODE OF PUSH TO TALK<br>
OVER CELLULAR SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of establishing a session for a Push-<br>
to-Talk (PTT) over Cellular (PoC) call. More particularly, the present invention relates<br>
to a method and system for processing a PoC call based on an answer mode of push to<br>
talk over cellular system client, that is capable of processing a call in consideration of<br>
an answer mode mismatch between a PoC server and a PoC terminal when a receiving<br>
PoC user established home PoC server and a pre-established session in the PoC<br>
terminal and an AUTO-ANSWER mode in the PoC server.<br>
Background Art<br>
Due to significant development of mobile communications technologies and the<br>
expansion of mobile carminications networks, various services and applications<br>
which use cellular phones are being provided. At the same time, demand among<br>
cellular phone users for various extra services such as location services, a multimedia<br>
services, and a PTT services is increasing. Among these extra services, the PTT<br>
service supports various supplementary functions such as an instant messenger<br>
function and a status display function, as well as a group call and a voice call which<br>
are also provided by an existing radio or a trunked radio system (TRS).<br>
Standardization of PoC services which employ the PTT function in a mobile com-<br>
munication network is actively proceeding. One unique feature of the PoC service is<br>
that a user can participate in a plurality of PoC sessions and so can move among the<br>
PoC sessions to use a call service. A requirement that a user can move among a<br>
plurality of PoC sessions to use a call service is specified in the Open Mobile Alliance<br>
(OMA) which is a forum for specifying mobile carminications services.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a conventional PoC service system. Referring<br>
to FIG. 1, a PoC client 10, which is a service requester installed in a mobile station,<br>
(not shown) (i.e., a PoC terminal), is connected to a SIP/IP core network 30 which<br>
supports Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia<br>
functions via an access network 20.<br>
The PoC client 10 resides in the PoC terminal and provides access to the PoC<br>
service. The PoC client 10 initiates a PoC session, participates in a PoC session that is<br><br>
receives requests for the floor from PoC clients, arranges an order in which to give the<br>
clients the floor, and gives the clients the floor in that order. The PoC server also<br>
distributes a talk burst from a specific PoC client to all PoC clients participating in a<br>
group PoC call, and provides information of the PoC clients participating in the group<br>
PoC call.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the PF manages a PoC session between the CF and each PoC<br>
client. The PF relays the floor to the PoC client from the CF. The PF relays media<br>
between the CF and the PoC client, provides transcoding between different codecs, and<br>
provides a filtering function for filtering one of two PoC sessions chosen by a user<br>
when there is simultaneous voice communication in two simultaneous PoC sessions.<br><br><br>
on a group and information on a group member in a GLMS manager 40 through the<br>
user's terminal, or identify information on the PoC users whom the user can call<br>
through an individual or a group list transmitted from the GLMS manager 40. Another<br>
method where the group and group member can be generated, corrected, and managed<br>
in the GLMS manager 40 is to input them through a communication network<br>
considered to be reliable by the PoC service provider, such as Internet or an Intranet.<br>
In order to use a PoC call service, the PoC user registers the user's PoC address in<br>
the SIP/IP core 30. At this time, the SIP/IP core 30 stores information on the PoC user<br>
based on the PoC user's request. Accordingly, when other PoC users wish to make a<br>
PoC group call, the user registers the user's information in the SIP/IP core 30 network<br>
first, and makes a call request to the user's SIP/IP core network using group iden-<br>
tification information transmitted from the GLMS 50. At this time, the SIP/IP core 30<br>
determines an address and a domain location using information on requesting PoC user<br>
information, and then transmits a PoC call request to a home PoC server 60 in which<br>
the requesting PoC user is registered. The PoC server 60 prepares PoC session es-<br>
tablishment for such a PoC call request, obtains each user's information from the<br>
GLMS 50 and transfers a call request signal to the corresponding SIP/IP core network.<br>
At this time, in the case of a call request for users in an intradomain, the PoC server 60<br>
performs both of PF and CF functions. The PoC server 60 managing a PoC user to<br>
whom a call request is made uses PoC user information transferred thereto, determines<br>
the location of the SIP/IP core network, and then makes a call request to the PoC user.<br>
The present invention relates to call processing technology for setting up a call of a<br>
PoC system which enables an immediate call according to the call request using an IP<br>
Multimedia CN network which is currently being standardized, using a call in the form<br>
of a half duplex communication, and using group and presence information of the user.<br>
Specially, in the call processing to set up such a PoC call, various procedures can be<br>
performed according to request and situation of sender and receiver. Features of the<br>
PoC system requested in the OMA according to the setup of the sender and receiver<br>
are as follows.<br>
First, the receiver can set up its own response mode according to the request of the<br>
PoC user and generally divide the response mode into an automatic response mode and<br>
a manual mode.<br>
The automatic response mode means that when included in the PoC user list<br>
assigned in the receiver, a corresponding network immediately sends the response to<br>
the sender, instead of a manual response of the receiver. Because the PoC server has a<br><br>
function to store the response mode and the corresponding user list according to the<br>
response mode setup request of the terminal, the network automatically sends the<br>
response instead of operation of the terminal. Meanwhile, the manual response mode<br>
that corresponds to a case that the receiver is not included in the automatic response<br>
user list, a case that it is not clear that the receiver is included in the automatic<br>
response user list, or a case that the receiver is set up to manually respond to all users,<br>
means that the PoC call request is transmitted to the user's terminal through the<br>
receiving network and the call is connected under permission of the PoC user.<br>
Second, the PoC system is divided into an on-demand session mode and a pre-<br>
established session mode according to whether the system is connected and set up to<br>
the PoC server in the user home network.<br>
The pre-established session mode means that the PoC user sets up a specific<br>
session in advance between the PoC client and the PoC server belonging to the user's<br>
home network according to the user's request. Such a pre-established session is a<br>
function that the PoC user negotiates media parameters with the PoC server in advance<br>
so that a rapid call setup is embodied without renegotiation of the media parameter<br>
between the server and the client to be used in the future. The pre-established session<br>
is embodied when the PoC client provides the media parameters that are supported to<br>
an Session Description Protocol (SDP) body through an SIP INVITE method and<br>
responds to the media parameters provided by the server. In order to make the pre-<br>
established session, the PoC client sends identification information of the pre-<br>
established session newly set up in the response message from the server including a<br>
conference Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the PoC user. In the case of using<br>
such a pre-established session, it is possible to pre-establish an IP address, a port<br>
number, a codec to be used, and a talk burst control protocol.<br>
The on-demand session mode means the state that the PoC user did not make the<br>
pre-established session and performs a PoC call connection procedure after receiving<br>
an invitation message of another PoC user.<br>
Meanwhile, the PoC specification that is under the standardization in the OMA has<br>
following features rather than the basic functions of the communication system<br>
described above.<br>
First, the PoC system supports a manual answer override (MAO) mode in which<br>
the receiver automatically sends a response to the PoC user who is pre-established and<br>
granted regardless of the response mode of the PoC receiver and connects a call in the<br>
receiving terminal. A request of the MAO is supported only to granted call requesters<br><br>
and a PoC call request message (INVITE) including the MAO indicator is transferred.<br>
Such an MAO request is a PoC function suitable for responding to emergencies and<br>
public services such as, emergency response corrmunications, disaster relief commu-<br>
nications, rescue and response communications, etc. However, such an MAO is a<br>
function that can be optionally embodied in a Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standard<br>
document depending on an operator. Moreover, the MAO function cannot operate<br>
unless the opposite network supports this function even though the PoC client supports<br>
the MAO in its own home network.<br>
Next, a setup of the response mode for the call request in the PoC system can be<br>
stored in both the PoC server which is an element on the network and the PoC client<br>
which is a terminal of the user side. Specially, when establishing a response mode in<br>
the home network managing the PoC client, the response mode is embodied in the PoC<br>
server which performs a session participating PoC function (PF) in the home network<br>
including the PoC client. As such, in the case of establishing the response mode of the<br>
network side, when the PoC call is requested from another PoC server, the PF auto-<br>
matically transfers a session progress message to the call request network in response<br>
to the request, so that the call request procedure is simplified when compared to the<br>
procedure wherein the session setup message is transferred to the PoC client and<br>
thereafter responded to.<br>
However, in the case that the response is automatically performed in the network,<br>
since a result other than a user's response will can occur, the PoC user can set up the<br>
response mode even in the user's client, and at this time, it is characterized in that the<br>
response mode of the user's client is established to the response mode setup on the<br>
network. It is for solving a privacy problem occurring when a response mode is not<br>
reflected in real time, due to a signal delay or an error in a radio access network or IP<br>
core network, when the PoC user changes the user's response mode through the<br>
terminal and requires the PoC server to update the response mode. To sum up, while<br>
the PoC service can set up the user's response mode in both the PoC server and PoC<br>
client, the media (actual user's voice) stream is transferred on the basis of the PoC<br>
session connection through behavior determined by a user's will.<br>
Considering various functions and characteristics of the PoC system, various PoC<br>
call processing procedures can be generated. The present invention relates to a method<br>
for providing message information to display an automatic response for a general PoC<br>
call request of the sender (in the case that an optional MAO is not requested) and<br>
performing call processing for the PoC call request in interworking with the respond<br><br>
mode setup of an end PoC terminal, when a session is pre-established between the PoC<br>
server of the PoC call receiver and the client and an automatic response mode is set up<br>
in the PoC server.<br>
Hereinafter, a conventional PoC session connection procedure in a PoC system<br>
having characteristics described above will be explained with reference to FIGs. 2 and<br>
3. FIGs. 2 and 3 are flow diagrams illustrating respective call processing procedures of<br>
a call sender and a call receiver, when a general PoC call requester requests the call<br>
processing by sending the request message using the SIP protocol, and the automatic<br>
response mode is set up and a pre-established session exists in the receiver.<br>
First, referring to FIG. 2, in Step 1 a PoC Client A sends an INVITE request<br>
including SIP address information of a receiver whom the Client A wishes to talk to an<br>
SIP/IP Core A. At this time, the INVITE request includes elements such as PoC<br>
address information of a call request client, a required media parameter, and char-<br>
acteristic information indicating the PoC service, and is transferred (in step 2) to a par-<br>
ticipating PoC server by way of corresponding servers (e.g., proxy-call server control<br>
function (P-CSCF)) and a serving-call server control function (S-CSCF, not shown)) in<br>
the IMS network through a path query in a dynamic host configuration protocol<br>
(DHCP) server or a domain name server (DNS) server (not shown). Since the par-<br>
ticipating PoC server connected to the PoC user when requesting a general call can be<br>
embodied in separation with the controlling PoC server managing a talk burst of the<br>
opened session, the INVITE request sent at steps 1 and 2 is transferred to the<br>
controlling PoC server X by way of an SIP/IP Core network of each network (in steps<br>
3-5).<br>
A controlling network including a CF transfers the call request message transferred<br>
in 5 to the corresponding SIP/IP Core network and then receives a response message.<br>
While the SIP message responding in the receiving network may be a provisional<br>
response message (i.e., a lXX-type message), a successful response message (i.e., a<br>
2XX-type message), or error response messages (i.e., a 4XX - 6XX-type message), the<br>
present invention primarily describes a normal call processing procedure. The 1XX -<br>
6XX-type messages are known in the art and are not described further herein for the<br>
sake of clarity. After step 5 is performed, the CF can receive an AUTO-ANSWER<br>
response or an OK response. In the case of the AUTO-ANSWER response in FIG. 2,<br>
the CF can receive an SIP 183 "Session Progress" signal, and progress connection<br>
between the PoC server and the client in an IMS network of the requester. A call<br>
permission signal of the receiver is sent as an SIP 183 Session Progress or an SIP 200<br><br>
"OK" response, and transferred to the PoC client A by way of the PoC servers of the<br>
CF and PF (steps 6-10). Meanwhile, after the CF receives the 200 OK response or the<br>
183 Session Progress signal from the receiving PoC server, it determines that the PoC<br>
call is connected and sends a floor granted signal with which a talk burst floor is<br>
granted for the client A (steps 11-12). After the PoC client A receives confirmation<br>
response signals in steps 6-10 corresponding to the INVITE request, it receives the<br>
floor granted signal using a real time control protocol (RTCP) message to transfer a<br>
talk burst transmission permission signal (call connection sound) (in steps 11 - 12). At<br>
this time, the floor granted signal is generated in the CF having a talk burst negotiation<br>
right and transferred to the PoC client through the PF managing the corresponding PoC<br>
client, and may be transferred without passing through the SIP/EP Core network by<br>
using a path of a bearer rather than the SEP protocol. Finally, the PoC user who<br>
confirmed such a call connection sound transfers the media (voice, representatively)<br>
stream using a real time protocol (RTP).<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating a conventional procedure in the receiver when<br>
a session between the server and the client in the receiver was pre-established cor-<br>
responding to call procedures in the sender. (At this time, it is assumed that media<br>
feature values between the PoC server establishing a pre-established session and the<br>
PoC client are used as they are without changing when a new session is requested).<br>
An INVITE request call request message received from the sending network is<br>
transferred to the PoC server included in the home network of the receiving PoC client<br>
according to a call processing procedure of the IMS network (in steps 1-3). At this<br>
time, since the PF B (PoC server B)set up its response mode setup value as an<br>
automatic response mode, the PF B sends the SIP 200 "OK" message to the sending<br>
network corresponding to the call request message (in steps 4-6). Further, since the<br>
pre-established session need not be changed, the PF B does not send the call request<br>
message to the PoC client connected to the PF B.<br>
Meanwhile, the PoC server of the controlling network that has received an OK<br>
response acknowledged through an IMS path completes the PoC call processing<br>
procedure by sending an OK response to the sending PoC client (step 7), and sends the<br>
floor granted signal with which a talk burst floor is granted to the sending PoC client<br>
(step 8). Meanwhile, the CF sends the PoC address of the PoC user having the floor or<br>
a sending Talk Burst signal including a display name to the receiving PoC user while<br>
sending the RTCP message which grants the floor (steps 9 - 10), so that the receiving<br>
PoC client can receive sender information of a media stream to be transferred in<br><br>
advance. Talk Burst signal uses the bearer path (as in FIG. 2) as opposed to the SIP<br>
protocol, and therefore can be transferred without passing through the SIP/IP Core<br>
network. Meanwhile, the media (voice) stream sent from the sender is transferred to<br>
the client B using the RTP protocol through the path of the media bearer, thereby<br>
starting a call.<br>
Fig. 4 is a table illustrating information elements included in the INVITE request<br>
requested by the sender corresponding to step 1 of FIG. 3. The call request message<br>
includes PoC addresses of the PoC call requester and receiver, media parameter in-<br>
formation given by in the client or server, an indicator indicating a PoC call, an<br>
indicator set up in the PoC server, a talk burst control protocol to negotiate between<br>
sending and receiving networks, etc.<br>
When the PoC server managing the pre-established session set ups an automatic<br>
response mode for the PoC client in which the pre-established session exists, the PF<br>
directly acknowledges the OK response without sending the AUTO-ANSWER in the<br>
call request processing procedure of the conventional art.<br>
The OK response in the receiving PoC server is sent to the sending network so that<br>
the sending PoC client receives the talk burst permission signal together with the OK<br>
response signal and transfers an actual media stream. Further, since the CF which is a<br>
PoC server has received the 200 OK signal, it directly transfers the transferred media<br>
stream to the receiving network without buffering it. Further, since the PoC server of<br>
the receiving network does not accompany a separate SIP signal for the transferred<br>
media stream, it directly transfers the media stream to the receiving PoC client using<br>
the RTP.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
As such, when following the session procedure and media transfer procedure in<br>
which the pre-established session and automatic response mode are set up, if a<br>
response mode of the receiving PoC client is not automatically set up (that is, when<br>
other "race conditions" occur in the response mode set up between the server and the<br>
terminal due to a temporary response mode change, the "race condition" means the<br>
state the mode of the PoC server is different from that of the PoC client by time delay<br>
or so. For example, a PoC client request to change the PoC server's mode from<br>
"Auto-answer mode" to "Manual-answer mode". In this case, we can call the time<br>
delay from "the time the PoC client requests" to "the time the PoC server change its<br>
mode reflecting on the PoC client's request" is the "race condition"), the receiving<br><br>
PoC client cannot obtain information to process a transferred media stream, which is<br>
an undesirable consequence.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
It is, therefore, an objective of the present invention to provide a method and<br>
system for processing a call based on an answer mode of a Push-to-Talk (PTT) over<br>
Cellular (PoC) system client in which when an automatic response mode is set up in a<br>
pre-established session and a response mode change of a receiving PoC client is not<br>
reflected, response mode information is transferred to the PoC client in order to<br>
process a transferred media stream in a receiving terminal so that the call processing is<br>
performed to immediately cope with the changed response mode of the PoC client.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a call processing<br>
method in a PoC network in which a session is established in advance between a<br>
receiving PoC client and a receiving PoC server, and an automatic response mode is<br>
established in the receiving PoC server, the method including receiving, at the<br>
receiving PoC server, a call request message transmitted from a sending PoC server;<br>
sending, at the receiving PoC server, a response signal for the call request message;<br>
and receiving information to notify that a media stream will be transmitted to the<br>
receiving PoC client.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a call<br>
processing system in a PoC network in which a session is established in advance<br>
between a receiving PoC client and a receiving PoC server, and an automatic response<br>
mode is established in the receiving PoC server, the system including a receiving PoC<br>
server for receiving a call request message transmitted from a sending PoC server, and<br>
sending a response message for the call request message; and a receiving PoC client<br>
for receiving information to notify that a media stream will be received from the<br>
receiving PoC server.<br>
In a receiving PoC system in which a receiving PoC client and a receiving PoC<br>
server operate in an automatic response mode and a session is pre-established,<br>
provided is a process of transferring, at a PF, information including additional data to<br>
the receiving PoC client when a call connection request message is received frcm a<br>
sending PoC server. Accordingly, the receiving PoC client notifies that the media<br>
stream will be immediately received even in the automatic response mode.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
The present invention discloses a process wherein when the receiving PoC client<br>
and receiving PoC server operate in the automatic answer mode, and the receiving PoC<br><br>
system to which the pre-established session is established has received the call<br>
connection request message from the sending PoC server, the PF transfers information<br>
including additional data to the receiving PoC client. Accordingly, the receiving PoC<br>
client can recognize that the media stream will be received soon even in the automatic<br>
answer mode, and the PoC client can perform the call processing responsive to the<br>
PoC call request in the PoC client even when there is a discrepancy in an answer mode<br>
between the receiving PoC server and the receiving PoC client. As a result, ac-<br>
companying signaling in the network is reduced and a high-speed PoC call connection<br>
is maintained. It is possible to provide enhanced service to the PoC user and efficiently<br>
manage communication resources by preventing unnecessary media transmission at a<br>
service provider.<br>
Especially, the present invention suggests a signaling method that can be embodied<br>
without being affected by a race condition where answer modes between the PoC user<br>
terminal and the PoC server are not synchronized, so that there is a corresponding<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are<br><br>
shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be<br>
construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments<br>
are provided to convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
A call connection procedure suggested according to the present invention will now<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 5. Fig. 5 is a flow diagram illustrating a PoC call<br>
connection processing procedure including an RTCP message when a receiving PF is<br>
set in an automatic response mode for a client having a pre-established session. First, a<br>
controlling PoG server receives a call request message including PoC call information<br>
from a network of a PoC call requester and then transfers the call request message to a<br>
PoC server belonging to a home network of a receiving PoC user via SIP/IP core<br>
networks of a controlling network and a receiving home network (in steps 1-3). At this<br>
time, the participating PoC server processes PoC address information for a PoC call<br>
receiver and PoC address information of a PoC call requestor contained in the call<br>
request message, and uses them to connect the call. Meanwhile, the participating PoC<br>
server can recognize, from the address information of the receiving PoC client, that the<br>
pre-established session exists between a corresponding PoC user and a PF, and stores a<br>
PoC client response mode according to a mode setup of the PoC user. At this time, a<br>
PF B performs a suitable internal processing procedure to return an OK response to the<br>
call request message (in steps 4-6). Here, the OK response is routed along a path used<br>
to send the call request message according to a routing rule of an IMS network.<br>
In the automatic response procedure of steps 4-6, the participating PoC server will<br>
use a pre-established session in which a negotiation was made in advance for a media<br>
parameter between the participating PoC server and the receiving PoC user, and the PF<br>
predicts that the receiving PoC client will automatically accept the session request<br>
from a granted PoC call requester and sends the OK response.<br>
The OK response signal described above is returned to the'PoC server on the<br>
controlling network ("controlling PoC server") (in steps 6) and then transferred to a<br>
home network of the PoC call requester (in step 7). The OK response signal is<br>
recognized at the PoC call sender in the same manner as the receiving PoC user<br>
directly grants the call, and the OK response is returned to the PoC client of the call<br>
requester, so that a dialogue is realized and the SIP call procedure is completed.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 2, after the OK response and the floor granted signal are<br>
both transferred from the controlling PoC server to the PoC sending client (step 8), the<br>
controlling PoC server on the transfers a talk burst transmission signal to the receiving<br>
PoC client via the receiving PoC server PF B (in steps 9 - 10). In this case, a RTCP<br><br>
talk burst message including an automatic response indication is transferred at the PF<br>
B. As such, the automatic response signal is transmitted using the talk burst signal,<br>
thereby eliminating additional SEP signaling which may lead to transmission burden.<br>
Next, the receiving PoC client receives the OK signal as the automatic response from<br>
the PoC server and recognizes that the media stream will be received soon. Finally,<br>
after receiving the automatic response message over the RTCP talk burst message, the<br>
PoC client receives subsequent media (e.g., a voice signal). The talk burst message can<br>
be materialized by RTCP message<br>
Meanwhile, the RTCP talk burst message may pass through the PF depending on<br>
whether the PF exists on a media path, and may be directly transferred to the PoC<br>
client if the PF does not exist in the media path. When the media path includes the PF<br>
B, the automatic response signal can be included in the PF B (which is not required in<br>
step 10), and when the media path does not include the PF B, the automatic response<br>
signal should be included in the CF (which is required in steps 9 - 10).<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the RTCP message<br>
indicating the automatic response mode may be transferred to the receiving PoC client<br>
at the time when the PoC call request message from the transmitting side arrives at the<br>
receiving PF (immediately after step 3 in FIG. 5). Such a PoC session connection<br>
procedure is shown in FIG. 6. (Referring to FIG. 6, steps 1 - 3, 5 - 7 and 9 - 10, are the<br>
same as those illustrated in Fig. 5 in which the RTCP talk burst transmission message<br>
in steps 11 - 12 in Fig. 6 does not include a response mode indication.<br>
After receiving PF transfers an indication to indicate an automatic response to the<br>
PoC client B using the RTCP message in response to the PoC session request from the<br>
sending side, the receiving PoC client recognizes that a corresponding media stream<br>
will be received soon (in step 4). Meanwhile, the receiving PoC server sends the OK<br>
response signal to the sending network regardless of the receipt of the response (in step<br>
5). Meanwhile, the client, which receives the automatic response indication, sends an<br>
error occurrence signal from the client to the PF using the RTCP message when its<br>
response mode is in a manual mode and does not match that of the PF. The PoC server<br>
blocks a transferred media stream in response to receiving such an error signal,<br>
preventing a media stream from being transmitted to the terminal.<br>
A structure of the RTCP message indicating a response mode, which is transferred<br>
to the receiving PoC client, in FIG. 5 can be embodied in an RTCP message payload<br>
format as shown in FIG. 7, for example. From message information containing the<br>
response mode indication, it can be determined that the media stream will be soon<br><br>
received. As shown in FIG. 7, the structure of the RTCP message requires general<br>
transmission related information such as version information, sub-type information and<br>
length information, and address information, name information, talk burst connection<br>
information of a PoC user, and includes automatic answer indication information<br>
specified herein.<br>
The structure of an error answer RTCP message transmitted from the receiving PoC<br>
client to the PF as shown in Fig. 6 may be embodied in an format shown in FIG. 8, for<br>
example. As shown in Fig. 8, the structure of an RTCP packet includes general RTCP<br>
transmission related information such as version information, sub-type information and<br>
length information, address information and name information of a PoC user, and<br>
session termination information and error code information specified herein.<br>
Meanwhile, when there is no field value indicating the automatic answer in<br>
indicating an answer mode at the PF, the field value can be expressed by a binary<br>
system(e.g., auto-answer indication = 1 in the automatic answer, and manual-answer<br>
indication = 0 in a manual answer).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the procedure including the<br>
automatic answer indication may be performed by the PoC server on the controlling<br>
network along the path of the RTCP/RTP bearer or by the PoC server on the receiving<br>
home network, as described above. Further, as the receiving PoC client receives in-<br>
formation including the automatic answer indication from the receiving PoC server, it<br>
can recognize that the media stream will be received soon.<br>
While a path between the PoC server and the client and additional resource<br>
reservation may be included according to the use of the pre-established session,<br>
detailed description thereof will be omitted since it departs from the subject matter of<br>
the present invention. The requirement for the pre-established session needed in the<br>
present invention is not affected by the definition of the pre-established session, and<br>
can be more easily realized according to extended definition of the pre-established<br>
session.<br>
When the pre-established session is set at the PoC call receiver and the automatic<br>
answer mode is set at the PoS server included in the pre-established session, among<br>
various PoC call processing procedures occurring when various functions and charac-<br>
teristics of the PoC system are considered, the present invention suggests a method for<br>
facilitating a call processing responsive to the PoC call request.<br>
Generally, an automatic answer mode is a service wherein a receiving PoC client<br>
directly answers an incoming call without any manual operation and performs rapid<br><br>
call processing to receive media.While the present invention has been described with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing<br>
