				<td>The present invention relates to a rumen bacterial mutant which produce succinic acid at higji concentration while producing little or no other organic acids, as well as a method for producing succinic acid, which is characterized by lie culture of such mutants in anaerobic conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Various anaerobic microoigamsms, including Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus Jlavefaciens and the like, produce succinic acid as an end product by. glucose metabolism (Zeikus, Annu. Rev. Microbiol, 34:423, 1980). Strains that produce succinic acid at industrially useful yield have not yet been reported except for Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens known to produce succinic acid at high concentration and high yield fiom glucose upon the presence of excessive CO2 (David et al, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol, 26:498, 1976). However, since Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens is an obligate anaerobic microorganism, a fermentation process of producing succinic acid using this microorganism has a shortcoming that the process itself becomes unstable even upon exposure to a very small amount of oxygen.<br>
To overcome this shortcoming, Mannheimia succiniciproducens 55E was developed that is a strain having not only resistance to oxygen but also high organic acid productivity.    However, since this strain produces formic acid.<br><br>
acetic acid and lactic acid in addition to succinic acid, it has shortcomings in &amp;at it has low yield and costs a great deal in a purification process of removing other organic acids except succioic acid.<br>
Recombinant E. coli strains for the production of succinic acid have been reported in various literatures. If the E. coli strains have disruptions of a gene coding for lactate dehydrogenase and a gene coding for pyruvate fonnate-lyase, it is hard for them to grow in anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, they have too low yield to apply them to industrial field, since, although lactic acid is not produced as a fermentation product, otiier metabolites (acetic acid and ethanol) account for about half of the production of succinic acid, hi an attempt to overcome such shortcomings, E. coli cells were grown in aerobic conditions, and then anaerobic conditions were applied to induce the fermentation of succinic acid. However, this attempt still has low productivity (Vemuri et al, J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol, 28:325, 2002). Also, other examples were reported in which the genes of enzyrues, such as pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and malic enzyme, that immobilize CO2 in a metabolic pathway of succinic acid fermentation, are introduced into E. coli, thereby increasmg the production of succmic acid (Vemuri et al, Appl. Enviwn. Microbiol, 68:1715, 2002; Millard et al, Appl Environ. Microbiol, 62:1808, 1996; Chao and Liao, Appl Environ. Microbiol, 59:4261, 1993; Stols andDonnelly, Appl Environ. Microbiol, 63:2695,1997).<br>
Meanwhile, it is known that the disruption of ptsG in E. coli contributes to an impmvemftTit of bacterial production and succinic acid production (Chattegee et al, Appl Environ. Microbiol, 67:148. 2001), but most of rumen bacteria have no ptsG, and thus have an advantage that they do not require a removal process of ptsG as m the case of E. coli. Recentiy, an atten^t is actively conducted in which the genes of enzymes that immobilize CO2 in a metabolic pa&amp;way of succinic acid fermentation are introduced into rumen bacteria, including genus<br><br>
Actinobacillus and genus Anaerobiospirillum. However, in this attempt, other organic acids were produced at large amounts or the yield of succinic acid "Wis so low, as a result of that, it did not reach an industrially applicable level.<br>

Example 3:   Construction oj Mannheimia sp. LPK strain<br>
?IG 3 shows a process of constructing a mutant strain (LPK) by disrupting IdhA md pfl genes from Mannheimia succiniciproducens 55E. Mannheimia "succiniciproducens 55E was plated on LB-glucose medium containing 10 g/1 of glucose, and cultured at 37°C for 36 hours.   The colony formed was inoculated<br><br>
in 10 ml of LB-glucose liquid medium, and cultured for 12 hours. The culture broth which had been sufficiently grown was inoculated by 1% in 100 ml of LB-ghicose liquid medium, and cultured in a shaking incubator at 200 ipm and "iT"C.<br>
When the culture broth reached an OD of about 0.2-0.3 after 4-5hours, it was centriiuged at 4*0 and 4000 ipm for 10 minutes to collect cells. Then, the cells were resuspended in 200 nil of 10% glycerol solution at 4°C. The suspension was centriiuged at 4"C and 4000 ipm for 10 minutes, and tiie cells were collected and resuspended in 200 ml of 10% glycerol solution at 4""C, and then centriiuged at 4°C and 4000ipm for 10 miimtes to collect the cells. The cells were suspended in glycerol at a volume ratio of 1:1, to obtain cell concentrate.<br>
The cell concentrate thus obtained was mixed with the genetic exchange vectors pMLKO-sacB and pMPKO-sacB constructed in Stamples I and 2, and then subjected to electroporation under conditions of 1.8 kV, 25 ^F and 200 ohms. 1 ml of LB-glucose hquid medium was added to the electroporated mixture and cultured in a shaking incubator at 37°C and lOOrpm for one hour. The culture broth was plated on LB-glucose soHd medium contaming a suitable antibiotic [Km (final concaitration of 25 lagtail) or Cm (6.8 jig/ml) and cultured at 37°C for 48 hours or more. In order to select a colony ^here only double crossover occurred, ths colonies formed were streaked on LB-sucrose medium (LB medium with IOOg/1 suCTOse) containing Km 25 Hg/ml) or Cm (6.8|ag/ml). Ailer 24 hours, the formed colonies were streaked again on the same plate.<br>
The colony (mutant) formed on the plate were cultured in LB-glucose liquid medium containing an antibiotic, and a genomic DNA was isolated firom the cultured strain by the method described in Rochelle et al. (FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 100:59, 1992). PCR was performed using the isolated mutant genomic DNA as a template, and the PCR product was electrophoresed to confirm the disruption of IdhA and/?/? genes from the PCR product<br><br>
hi order to confirm the disruption of tiie IdkA gene, PCRs were performed twice m the following manners.

LPK was inoculated in ttie preculture medium and precultured at 39*C for 14 hours. Then, 0.9 L of culture medium consisting of 20g/L glucose, 5g/L polypeptone, 5g/L yeast extract, 3g/L K2HPO4, Ig/L NaQ, 5g/L (NH4)2S04, 0.2g/L CaQj - 2H2O, 0.2g/L MgClj • 6H2O and 5g/L NajCOa was put in a 2.5-L culture tanV^ and 100 ml of the precultured microorganisms<br><br>
