The present invention relates to a cycling shoe cleat-engaging bicycle pedal, in particular to clipless bicycle pedals for offload cycling into which special cleats fitted to cycling shoes are engageable.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
So-called clipless bicycle pedals, as disclosed, for example, in Laid-open (Kokai) Japanese Patent Application H3-159893, are known as alternatives to pedals equipped with toe-clips for the increased pedalling efficiency gained by transmitting pedalling power during the up- as well as the down-stroke in pedalling.  Clipless pedals include a mechanism for engaging a cleat configuration specially fitted to the bottom of cycling shoes.<br>
The clipless pedal is composed of a main pedal body supported to be freely rotatable on a pedal shaft attachable to the crank of a bicycle.  On either side of the main pedal body, a pair of front and rear cleat clasps is provided for clasping front and rear ends of the cycling shoe cleat.  The size of the is reduced to achieve a lightweight design.  The main pedal body is surrounded by a<br><br>
structure to form a tiny pedalling surface flanking the cleat clasps left and right.<br>
With the cleats thus clasped in the cleat clasps, clipless pedals of the foregoing type continuously hold the shoe to the pedal, for efficient transmission of pedalling force to the pedal.  Accordingly, clipless pedals are widely used, for instance, on racing bicycles in road as well as mountain- bike (MTB) races.<br>
In recent years there has been an increase in downhill races, dual slalom races, cross country races, etc. on MTBs as well as moto-cross bicycles (BMXs).  Such off-road races differ from road races in that they are run on unsurfaced tracks, where pedals are prone to a build-up of mud about the cleat-clasps.  A significant build-up of mud  may consequently prevent the cleat clasps from clasping the cycling shoe cleats, such that the shoe cannot engage the pedal.  That notwithstanding, during cornering in such off-road races the cyclist must frequently remove his or hpr foot from the pedal and then replace it ha.vinn negotiated the turn.<br>
Therefore, in cases where the cleat clasps are incapacitated from clasping the cleats due to a build-up of mud, or the cyclist's foot must be frequently removed from and replaced onto the pedal, it is essential that the pedal can be pedalled even though the cleats of the cyclist's<br><br>
shoes are not engaged in the cleat clasps.  As just mentioned, however, the conventional clipless pedals have been made as small as possible, which has reduced the pedalling surface.  Consequently, in cases where the cyclist cannot engage the cleats into the cleat clasps, there tends to be adverse lateral instability of the foot in pedalling.  The cyclist thus loses efficiency in transmitting pedalling force to the pedal, resulting in loss of speed, obviously a crucial factor during a race.<br>
Accordingly, when pedal mud build-up, or the necessity of bringing the shoe off and back onto the pedal during hard cornering is anticipated for off-road races of this sort, rather than clipless pedals, more frequent use is being made of ordinary pedals on neither side of which is any sort of cleat clasping mechanism for obtaining a good hold on the shoe.<br>
For the clipless pedal to be used as well in such cases as just described, the cyclist need only pedal without the cleats of the cycling shoes being enqaqed in the clasps.  Toward this end, one could conceive of providing a pedalling body surrounding the cleat clasps in order to increase the pedallinq surface with which the sho
As illustrated in Fig. 7, however, an MTB shoe 21 differs from a road race shoe in that the cleat 22 is<br><br>
fitted into a recess in the shoe bottom 27.  This design consideration is toward improving the suitability of the shoes for walking. Consequently, providing a pedalling body surrounding the cleat clasps of the conventional clipless pedal would impede the engaging of the cleats into the cleat clasps, due to interference by shoe bottom 21. This design would be functional only by limiting the direction in which the shoe could be engaged into the pedal, consequently, when attempting to insert the shoe in a direction other than the clasping direction, the cleat could not easily be re-clasped quickly, even in cases where there is no build-up of mud in the cleat clasps or any other out of the ordinary conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A principal object of the present invention is to facilitate smooth engagement of recessed-cleat cycling shoes with a clipless pedal.<br>
A further object is to enable stable, efficient<br>
engageable with a recessed-cleat cycling shoe, even ir. the event the cycling shoe cleats cannot be readily engaged<br>
A cycling shoe cleat-engaging bicycle pedal in accordance with the present invention includes a clasping mechanism mounted on a pedal shaft connectable to a bicycle<br><br>
:rank.  The clasping mechanism has a front cleat clasping srace and a rear cleat clasp, for clasping corresponding Eront and rear portions of the cycling shoe cleat.  The bicycle pedal further includes a pedalling body having a pedalling face surrounding the cleat clasping mechanism. Furthermore, the pedalling body is pivotal relative to the front cleat clasping brace and the rear cleat clasp, and is further equipped with an urging means for urging the front cleat clasping brace in a rotational direction relative to the pedalling body, wherein the front cleat clasping brace is positioned out of the pedalling body when the front cleat clasping brace is urged by the urging means.<br>
The rear cleat clasp is also pivotal relative to the pedalling body and clasps the cycling shoe cleat along a direction of extension of the pedal shaft.  Further, the pedalling body is formed with an anti-rocking lip in a position rearward of the rear cleat clasp.  The anti-rocking lip is as high or higher than the rear cleat clasp, and as long as or longer than the rear cleat clasp in the direction of extension of the pedal shaft.<br>
A clipless pedal thus configured in accordance with the present invention rotstionaily urges the front cleat clasping brace relative to the pedalling body such that it normally projects out from the pedalling body.  Accordingly the code does not interfere with the shoe bottom<br><br>
when the cycling shoe cleat is fit into the cleat clasps, such that the shoe can be readily and quickly engaged with the pedal.<br>
Since the rear cleat clasping part is pivotal relative to the pedalling body, it is located in a plane substantially coplanar with or below the pedalling body. When engaging the cleat into the pedal, the rear cleat clasp is positioned out of the way in the pedalling body to facilitate inserting the shoe into the front cleat clasping brace.<br>
Further, since the rear cleat clasp is normally out of the way below the anti-rocking part provided on the pedalling body, fitting the shoe into the front cleat clasping brace and engaging the cleat is further facilitated.<br>
Furthermore, a guide for guiding the cleat into the cleat clasp is formed along a rearmost portion of the anti-rocking lip.  The guide serves to guide the sole of ths shno as the nj.pat is fit. from the rear of the pedal into the cleat clasping mechanism.<br>
The anti-rocking lip provides contact extending in the pedal shaft direction with the sole of the shoe.  The stability provided with the cycling shoe cleat engaged into the cleat clasping mechanism of the pedal can control out of square fit of the shoe with the pedal, and can reduce<br><br>
loss of pedalling force transmitted to the pedal.<br>
The inventive pedal configuration further provides a large-area pedalling surface when the shoe cleat is engaged into the cleat clasping mechanism, even as the front cleat clasping brace is retracted out of the way into the pedal by engagement of the shoe with cleat clasping mechanism. The pedalling surface prevents left-to-right destabiliza-tion of the feet.  Thus even when the cleats are not, or cannot be, clasped by the cleat clasps, pedalling force can be transmitted efficiently.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a cycling shoe cleat-engaging bicycle pedal, comprising<br>
-	a pedal shaft connectable to a bicycle crank;<br>
-	a clasping mechanism mounted on said pedal shaft to be substantially orthogonal therewith, said clasping mechanism having a front cleat clasping brace, and a rear cleat clasp for clasping corresponding front and rear portions of a cycling shoe cleat; and<br>
-	a pedalling body having a pedalling face at least partly surrounding said cleat clasping mechanism;<br>
characterized in that:<br>
said pedalling body is pivotal relative to at least one of said front cleat clasping brace and said rear cleat clasp.<br>
These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, where like reference numerals denote corresponding parts throughout, in which:<br>

Reference is made to Fig. 1, showing a bicycle pedal in accordance with a principal embodiment of the invention. The bicycle pedal 1 (referred to simply as the pedal<br>
connected to bicycle crank 2. A pedal core 4 is supported to be fleely rotatable on pedal 3haft 3. Either side of the pedal core 4 ic engagcable with a cleat 22 fitted onto the ball of a cycling shoe 21.  A pedalling body 5 encompasses pedal core 4, and is mounted thereon to be freely rotatable.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 3/ pedal shaft 3 tapers in graduated stages.  Pedal core 4 is supported near the tip of pedal shaft 3 to be freely rotatable on ball bearing 10.  Ball bearing 10 includes race 12 retaining a plurality of steel ball bearings 11 in circumferential inner grooves at either end axially of the race 12.  The circumferential periphery at the base of pedal shaft 3 is cut with threads 13 for screwing into crank 2 (Fig. 1).<br>
Pedal core 4 includes a sleeve section 15, as shown in Figs. 1 to 4, supported to be freely rotatable on pedal shaft 3.  Race 12 is fitted into a portion of the bore of sleeve section 15.  A retaining tube 16, one end of which encompasses the base of pedal shaft 3, is also fitted into and is concentric with sleeve section 15, wherein the other end of the retaining tube 16 abuts against the adjacent rim of race 12.  The basal portion of retaining tube 16, extending from the adjacent end of sleeve section 15 toward crank 2, is of approximately the same diameter as sleeve<br>
A cleast clasping mechanism 17 is fixed to either of diametrically opposed sides of the mid-portion of sleeve section 15.  Each cleat clasping mecharnsm 17 fixed to a mount 18 provided for this purpose on either of the diametrically opposed sides of the sleeve section 15.<br>
A pair of substantially parallel stops 20 is provided<br><br><br>
mounts 18, at a predetermined spacing in the direction of the pedal shaft 3.  The stops 20 are fixed around the cylindrical surface of sleeve section 15.  With respect to a cycling shoe 21 when engaged into the cleat clasping mechanism 17, the stops 20 extend in forward-rearward direction of the pedal.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 2,  a pin 25 is provided protruding from a forward portion of the outer, i.e., furthest from the crank 2, side of the stop 20.  A coil spring 26 is wound around the shaft of the pin 25.  One end of the coil spring 26 is held by the stop 20, and the other end is held by the pedalling body 5. The coil spring 26 therein urges pedal core 4 in that rotational direction relative to pedalling body 5 which tends to bring the forward end of pedal core 4 upward.<br>
The cleat clasping mechanism 17 is for clasping to pedal 1 a connecting cleat 22, provided in the bottom of cycling shoe 21.  The cleat claspino mechanism 17 has a front cleat clsping brace 30 for clasping onto the front of cleat 22, and a rear cleat clasp 31 for clasping onto the rear of cleat 22.<br>
The front cleat clasping brace 30 is laterally symmetrical, and has a mounting brace portion 32 which is fastened to the mount 18 for the clasping mechanism 17.<br><br>
The forward end of front cleat clasping brace 30 is bent extending upward and rearward to form cleat clasp 33.<br>
From the middle of the rear end of the mounting brace portion 32 a stop tab 34 is formed protruding rearward-Further, pairs of cleat support wings 35 and 36 are provided forward and rearward, respectively, of the middle of mounting brace portion 32.  A pair of slide-checking tabs 37 for limiting forward sliding of the cleat 22  is formed bent upward from each of the support wings 35 and adjacent cleat clasp 33.<br>
Rear cleat clasp 31 is U-shaped, down-turned wherein either end is penetrated by a shaft 40 (Fig. 1), on which the ends of rear cleat clasp 31 are pivotal.  The shaft 40 is fixed in adjacent rearward portions of the stops 20.  A clasp release spring 41 is wound round the shaft 40, {the spring 41 appearing in Fig. 2 being that for the rear cleat clasp 31 on the underside of the pedal as depicted). Accordingly, the rear cleat clasp 31 is continuously urged by the clasp release spring .41 to pivot frontward (in the direction indicated by arrow A in Fig. 4).  Moreover, a tongue piece 42 for checking the frontward pivoting of the rear cleat clasp 31 is formed extending downward from the middle of the rearward edge of rear cleat clasp 31, therein abutting against stop tab 34.<br>
Pedalling part 5, made of an aluminum alloy for<br><br>
example, is composed of an  octagonal frame 50 having pedalling faces 4 9 surfaced flat on either side of the frame 50; a first bearing portion 51 fastened to the crank 2 side of frame 50 and supported to be freely rotatable on the cylindrical surface of the basal end of sleeve section 15; and a second bearing portion 52 fastened to the inside of frame 50 furthest from the crank 2 and supported to be freely rotatable within the tip end of the sleeve section 15.  in the front and rear ends of frame 50 are formed slots 53 and 54.  Tapered tips of the stops 20 provided on sleeve section 15 extend into the slots 53 and 54.<br>
As mentioned above, pedal core 4 is urged by coil spring 26. As viewed in Fig. 5 (A), pedal core 4 is urged anti-clockwise relative to pedalling body 5.  Consequently, the frontward tips of the stops 20 extending into the slots 53 and 54 contact the upper edge of slot 53, so checking the anti-clockwise rotation-  in this state, furthermore, the cleat clasp 33 of the front cleat clasping brace 30 is positioned above pedallinq face 49 of pedalling body 5. and the rear cleat clasp 31 is positioned below an anti-rocking lip 55 formed on pedalling body 5 as a raised extension on the rear of frame 50.  Therefore, when shoe 21 is fit into pedal 1, there is no interference between shoe bottom 27 and pedalling body 5, facilitating the operation of engaging the cleat 22 into the front cleat clasping brace<br><br>
30.<br>
Anti-rocking lips 55 are formed on either side of frame 50 of the pedalling body 5, extending in the direction of pedal shaft 3. The anti-rocking lips 55 are parabolic in cross-section.  The accordingly rounded rear edge of each lip 55 constitutes a guide 56 for smoothly guiding cleat 22 as the shoe 21 is fit into pedal 1.<br>
Fig. 5 (B) illustrates that the height of each anti-rocking lip 55 is essentially the same as adjacent rear cleat clasp 31 when the cleat 22 is clasped by cleat clasping mechanism 17.  Furthermore, as Fig. 2 clearly shows, the length of anti-rocking lip 55 in the pedal shaft 3 direction is considerably longer than that of rear cleat clasp 31. Accordingly, the bottom of shoe 27 is given support, where it would otherwise have no footing contact, with the provision of this type of anti-rocking lip 55 behind the rear cleat clasp 31.  Consequently, left-to-right rocking of the cyclist's foot is checked, such that pedalling force can be  transmitted to pedal 1 with improved efficiency.  Further, guide 56 of anti-rocking lip 55 serves to guide the shoe bottom when shoe 21 is fit into pedal 1, meanwhile guiding the cleat 22 smoothly into the cleat clasping mechanism 17.<br>
With reference to Fig. 5, an outline will be given below of the action of fitting the cycling shoe 21 into the<br><br>
pedal 1 in accordance with the embodiment described.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5 (A), wherein the shoe is not fit into pedal 1, front cleat clasping brace 30 of pedal core 4 is urged by coil spring 26 such that it is positioned above pedalling face 49 of pedalling body 5, and rear cleat clasp 31 is positioned below pedalling body 5.  In the action of fitting the shoe 21 into the pedal 1, as the shoe bottom 27 comes into contact with anti-rocking lip 55, the shoe 21 tip slides frontward toward the front cleat clasping brace 30, and the tip of cleat 22 is inserted into the cleat clasp 33.  In this situation, because the front cleat clasping brace 30 is initially positioned above the pedalling face 49 of the pedalling body 5, the tip of the cleat 22 can be easily inserted into the front cleat clasping brace 30 without interference from the pedalling body 5.<br>
Then, when the tip of cleat 22 has been inserted into cleat clasp 33 of front cleat clasping brace 30, shoe 21 is<br>
prossed fully into pedal 1 by application of force through<br>
the heel of shoe 21. Thereupon, anti-rocking lip 55 is pressed and relative rotation occurs between pedalling body<br>
5 and pedal core 4 against the arging force of coil spring<br>
26.  Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 5 (B), pedalling body 5 and pedal core 4 become approximately parallel-<br>
Tn this a situation, with further pressing downward<br><br>
through the shoe 21 heel, the rear end or creat 22 causes rear cleat clasp 31 to pivot rearward (in the direction reverse to arrow A in Fig. 4) against the urging force of the spring 41.  Thus cleat 22 is fit between the front cleat clasping brace 30 and the rear cleat clasp 31.  Once the cleat 22 has thus been inserted between the cleat clasping brace 30  and the cleat clasp 31, the rear cleat clasp 31, being urged by spring 41, reverts to its initial position (where tongue shaped piece 42 abuts on stop tab 34).  Cleat 22 thereby becomes clasped between the cleat clasping brace 30 and the cleat clasp 31.<br>
When cleat 22 has been clasped by the cleat clasping brace 30 and the cleat clasp 31, pedalling body 5 is then urged frontward relative to pedal core 4 by coil spring 26 (in the direction of arrow B in Fig._5 (B)).  Therefore the anti-rocking lip 55 is maintained in full contact against the shoe bottom 27 along the length of the lip 55 in the pedal shaft 3 direction. As a result, shoe bottom 27 is<br>
stabilixzd during pedalling lefr-to-right rocking of the<br>
shoe 21 is prevented, and pedalling force is transmitted efficiently to pedal 1.<br>
Moreover. pedalling bod" 5 is provided 3 relatively wide pedalling face 49 surrounding pedal core 4 for efficiency in transmitting pedalling power. The broadness pedalling face 49 nonetheless does not interfere with<br><br>
fitting the cycling shoe 21 into the pedal 1, because the nechanism of the present invention positions the front sleat clasping brace 30 above the pedalling body 5 by the relative pivoting between pedalling body 5 and pedal core 4. Consequently, clasping of cleat 22 is facilitated.<br>
Furthermore, wherein cleat 22 cannot be clasped by the cleat clasping brace 30 and the cleat clasp 31, for example, when a build-up of mud occurs on the shoe 21 and the cleat clasping mechanism 17 during a race and cleat clasping becomes impossible, or during frequent hard cornering, when the shoe 21 is placed on the pedal 1, the pedal core 4 pivots and the cleat clasping mechanism 17 is retreated.  As a result, shoe bottom 27 finds a wide pedalling face 49, and pedals 1 can be pedalled in a stable posture for the cyclist, avoiding left-to-right rocking of the foot. Thus in effect the functions of clipless pedals and two-sided pedals can be .incorporated into the one pedal.  As a result, even Under muddy or hard-cornering cvcl ing conditi on?-. tssdal 1 ino fores can still b^1 transmitted efficiently to pedal 1.<br>
Further, whsn the shoe;21 is to be released from pedal 1 . the heal portion of shoe 21 is tilted slightly to the outside (i.e., away from the crank 2) and rear cleat clasp 31 rotates rearward against the urging force of spring 41. Thereupon, the clasping action on the rear end of cleat 22<br><br>
is instantaneously released.<br>
(a) As shown in Fig. 6, an arrangement may be adopted in which only the rear cleat clasp 31b in pedal core 4b is free to pivot relative to pedalling body 5b.  In this arrangement, one of the two opposed pedalling surfaces constitutes a clipless pedal, and the other pedalling surface constitutes an ordinary pedal not equipped to clasp cleats. Sleeve section 15b is fastened to pedalling body 5b, and stop 20b is supported to be freely pivotal on the sleeve section 15b.  Pin 25b is provided protruding from stop 20b, and coil spring 26b is wound round pin 25b.  Rear cleat clasp 31b is urged in the direction of arrow C by this spring 26b.<br>
Furthermore, tongue piece 32c is attached to a mounting brace portion analogous to its counterpart, mounting brace portion 32 as described for the preferred embodiment, but not shown in Fig. 6 to provide for greater clarity in the figure. Tongue place 32c plvits together with stop 20b, and this is pressed b\ cleat 22 so that rear cleat clasp 31b is raised to the position illustrated by the broken line.<br>
In this case, when shoe 21 is fit into pedal lb, rear cleat clasp 31b, as illustrated by the broken line in Fig. 6, is brought into line with front cleat clasping brace<br><br>
30b, whereby cleat 22 can be clasped.  With this arrangement as well, clasping of cleat 22 can be easily achieved,  on the other hand, even if cleat 22 cannot be clasped by the clipless pedal side of pedal lb, pedalling force can be transmitted efficiently to the pedal lb using the opposite side.<br>
(b)	The form of the cleat clasping brace is not limited to those described in the foregoing embodiments. Moreover, other forms of cleat may also be used in the present invention.<br>
(c)	The form and the position of the urging means urging the pedalling body and pedal core are not limited t those in the described in the foregoing embodiments of the present invention.<br>

In the bicycle pedal constructed according to the invention, when at least one of a pair of cleat clasps is pivotal relative to the pedalling body and made to projed<br>
In an upward direction from the pedalling body, the<br>
pedalling body no longer interferes with the shoe bottom when the cleat is clasped by the cleat clasp, and claspin rakes place both quickly and easily.  Furthermore, if at least one of the cleat clasps is retreated relatively, to position where it does not interfere with pedalling, a laroe-area pedalling surface can be guaranteed on the<br><br>
pedalling body, and pedalling force can be transmitted efficiently, preventing the tendency otherwise of the foot to rock left to right, even if the cleat can not be clasped by the clasps.<br>
Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its spirit nor its scope. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the embodiments according to the present invention is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
