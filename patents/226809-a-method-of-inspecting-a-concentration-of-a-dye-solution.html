VALIDATION AND REVISION METHOD OF DYE SOLUTION COMPRISING SINGLE OR MIXED DYE FOR PRESCRIBED RECIPE AS STANDARD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention pertains, in general, to a method of inspecting a concentration of a dye solution including a single or a mixed dye based on a prescribed recipe as a standard to revise the concentration of the dye solution and, more particularly, to a method of inspecting a concentration of a dye solution including a single or a mixed dye based on a prescribed recipe as a standard to revise the concentration of the dye solution, in which a concentration of a single dye solution, or concentrations of dyes constituting a mixed dye solution and a concentration of the mixed dye solution are measured to compare the measured concentration of the single dye solution, or the measured concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution with a prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution shown in the prescribed recipe to calculate the amounts of the dyes and water additionally fed into the dye solution, thereby a color difference or a lot difference occurring in producing the dye solution is prevented.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is most important to desirably produce an initial dye solution so as to conduct a RFT(right first time) dying process capable of accomplishing a dying process at a time without a color correction or a re-dyeing. However, so far, there has not been developed any device capable of inspecting whether the initial dye solution is well produced or not, and even if the inspection for the initial dye solution is conducted,<br><br>
there has not been known how to change a composition of the inferior initial dye solution, thus the inferior initial dye solution has been wasted. Various methods of inspecting the initial dye solution have been suggested. For example, a dyeing process may be conducted in a workshop after a color of a sample dyed in a laboratory is inspected, or a dyeing process may be conducted after colors of products dyed by the initial dye solution are roughly inspected using a filter paper. Alternatively, a dyeing process may be conducted without inspecting the initial dye solution.<br>
However, the method of inspecting the initial dye solution of the sample after the sample is dyed in the laboratory may have disadvantages of delay of the due date and reduced productivity. Additionally, in the case that a separate inspection for the initial dye solution is not conducted, consistency of dyeing color is lowered and the number of re-dyeing attempts is relatively increased.<br>
Conventionally, there were no simple, precise, and standardized method of inspecting the initial dye solution and devices for inspecting the initial dye solution, thus the inferior initial dye solution had to be wasted when the inferior initial dye solution was produced, or the re-dyeing process had to be conducted when a color difference was found and a black re-dyeing process had to be conducted when a serious color difference and unlevel dyeing were found.<br>
Furthermore, a color of the sample dyed in the laboratory is compared with a prescribed color shown in a recipe before a dyeing process is conducted in a workshop, and when the color of the sample is different from the prescribed color, the sample must be re-dyed using additional dyes. Therefore, there is a need to develop a precise and standardized system and method of inspecting the initial dye solution to reduce the re-dyeing process and the generation of wastewater caused by<br><br>
the wrong combination of components constituting the initial dye solution.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior art, and an aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of inspecting a concentration of a dye solution including a single or a mixed dye based on a prescribed recipe as a standard to revise the concentration of the dye solution, in which light is transmitted to the dye solution through a first flow sensor installed in a dye solution measuring device, a second flow sensor using first optical fibers, or a dip prober having second optical fibers to directly dip a sensor in the dye solution to obtain absorptivity of the dye solution to calculate an initial dye solution concentration of a single or a mixed dye solution. At this time, a composition ratio of the dye solution is revised when a measured combination (concentration) ratio of dyes constituting the dye solution is different from a prescribed combination (concentration) ratio of the dyes, thereby the occurrence of a color difference due to the inferior initial dye solution is greatly reduced. Additional aspects and/or advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.<br>
The above and/or other aspects are achieved by providing a method of inspecting a concentration of a dye solution containing a single or a mixed dye based on a prescribed recipe as a standard to revise the concentration of the dye solution, including a first step of transmitting light to a first flow sensor installed in a dye solution measuring device into which a single or a mixed dye solution is fed, a second flow sensor using first optical fibers, or a dip prober having second optical<br><br>
fibers to directly dip a sensor in the dye solution to obtain absorptivity of the dye solution at a wavelength corresponding to the light, a second step of analyzing the absorptivity of the dye solution to calculate a concentration of a single dye solution, or concentrations of dyes constituting a mixed dye solution and a concentration of the mixed dye solution to compare a calculated concentration of the single dye solution, or calculated concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution with a prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution shown in the prescribed recipe as the standard to secure concentration differences for the dyes and dye solution, and a third step of calculating amounts of the dyes and water additionally fed into the dye solution using the concentration differences so as to allow the calculated concentration of the single dye solution, or calculated concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution to coincide with the prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution, and displaying the calculated amounts of the dyes and water.<br>
At this time, the dye solution measuring device includes a spectrophotometer. Further, the sensor includes the first or second flow sensor, connected to the dye solution measuring device, having a structure that two quartz cells are installed at a regular interval in the first or second flow sensor to allow the dye solution to smoothly flow between the two quartz cells to transmit the light to the dye solution therethrough, the first or second flow sensor having a structure that a third optical fiber is vertically attached to an external surface of a first quartz cell of the two quartz cells to transmit the light from the dye solution measuring device through the first quartz cell to the dye solution and a fourth optical fiber is vertically attached to an external surface of a second quartz cell of the two quartz cells to send the light<br><br>
passing through the first quartz cell and the dye solution to the dye solution measuring device, or the first or second flow sensor having the dip prober structured such that the light is transmitted through any one of two second optical fibers installed in the dip prober to the dye solution and the light reflected by a reflecting mirror is sent to the other of the two second optical fibers.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, the calculated concentration and pH of the single dye solution or the calculated concentrations and pH of the dyes and mixed dye solution, the prescribed concentration of the single dye solution or the prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution shown in the prescribed recipe, the concentration differences for the dyes and dye solution, and amounts of the dyes and water additionally fed into the dye solution are displayed on a monitor and stored in a database.<br>
The above and/or other aspects are achieved by providing the method further including automatically or manually diluting the single or mixed dye solution with water in a predetermined diluting ratio so as to easily measure the concentration of the single dye solution, or the concentrations of the dyes solution constituting the mixed dye solution and the concentration of the mixed dye solution, and feeding the diluted single or mixed dye solution through a circulating pump into the first or second flow sensor.<br>
The above and/or other aspects are achieved by providing the method further including opening solenoid valves installed at the tubes for connecting a beaker or a vessel containing the single or mixed dye solution to a tank for feeding the dyes and water into the beaker or vessel to additionally feed the dyes and water into the single or mixed dye solution so as to allow the calculated concentration of the single dye solution, or calculated concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution to<br><br>
coincide with the prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 schematically illustrate a dye solution measuring system according to<br>
the present invention;<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference should now be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components. After diluted using an automatic diluting device  1  as shown in FIG, 4 in a<br><br>
predetermined diluting ratio in order to measure a concentration of a single dye solution,  or concentrations  of dyes  constituting  a mixed  dye solution  and a concentration of the mixed dye solution, the single or mixed dye solution produced in a laboratory or a workshop is sent to a flow sensor using a circulating pump. In detail, when the single or mixed dye solution put in a beaker or a vessel 15 is weighed using an electronic balance 16, a central process and control unit 18 secures data of a weight of the single or mixed dye solution by a measure and control unit 17 in a real time, and then calculates an amount of water capable of diluting the single or mixed dye solution in a desired diluting ratio. The central process and control unit 18 functions to open solenoid valves 13a, 13b positioned at tubes 14a, 14b connected to a cold water tank 11 and a warm water tank 12 by the measure and control unit 17 to feed cold and warm water into the beaker or vessel 15.    In this regard, the central process and control unit 18 analyzes weights of water, and the single or mixed dye solution measured by the electronic balance 16 to control the solenoid valves 13a,  13b while checking whether a sufficient amount of water is fed into the beaker or vessel 15 or not. Preferably, the cold and warm water tank 11, 12 are connected to the beaker or vessel 15 through a plurality of tubes with different diameters. At this time, the solenoid valves are respectively installed on the tubes. Initially, the solenoid valve installed at the tube with a large diameter is opened to feed a greater amount of water into the beaker or vessel for a relatively short time. When a amount of water is getting close to the predetermined amount, the solenoid valve installed at the tube with a small diameter is opened to precisely control an amount of water fed into the beaker or vessel, thereby a diluting time of the dye solution is shortened and a dilution ratio of the dye solution is precisely controlled.<br><br>
Alternatively, workers may manually dilute the dye solution including a single or mixed dye without using the automatic diluting device 1.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the diluted single or mixed dye solution is fed by a circulating pump 2 into a first or a second flow sensor 3a, 3b, or a dye solution vessel 21. That is to say, when the circulating pump 2 is operated while an end 10b of a circulating pipe 8 is dipped in the single or mixed dye solution in the beaker or vessel 15, the single or mixed dye solution is fed through the circulating pipe 8 into the first or second flow sensor 3a, 3b, and when the operation of the circulating pump 2 is stopped, the single or mixed dye solution is discharged through the end 10b of the circulating pipe 8, or is collected into the dye solution vessel 21 through the end 10b of the circulating pipe 8.<br>
In this regard, a dye solution measuring device 4 having the first flow sensor 3a therein transmits light to the single or mixed dye solution passing through the circulating pipe 8 to send data used to calculate the absorptivity of the single or mixed dye solution to the central process and control unit 5.<br>
Useful is a spectrophotometer integrally combined with the first flow sensor 3a of FIG. 1, or the second flow sensor 3b using optical fibers 9a, 9b, or a dip prober 3c using optical fibers 9a, 9b of FIGS. 2 and 3 as the dye solution measuring device 4 in the present invention.<br>
The flow sensor 3b of FIG. 2 used in conjunction with the dye solution measuring device 4 may have a structure that two quartz cells are installed at a regular interval in the flow sensor 3b to allow the dye solution to smoothly flow between the two quartz cells to transmit the light to the dye solution therethrough. Alternatively, the flow sensor 3b may be structured such that an optical fiber is vertically attached to an external surface of a first quartz cell of the two quartz cells to transmit the<br><br>
light from the dye solution measuring device through the first quartz cell to the dye solution, and another optical fiber is vertically attached to an external surface of a second quartz cell of the two quartz cells to send the light passing through the first quartz cell and the dye solution to the dye solution measuring device. Furthermore, the dip prober 3c used in conjunction with the dye solution measuring device 4 as shown in FIG. 3 is structured such that the light is transmitted through any one of two second optical fibers installed in the dip prober 3c to the dye solution in the dye solution vessel 21 and the light reflected by a reflecting mirror is sent to the other of the two second optical fibers.<br>
The central process and control unit 5 serves to interpret data sent from the dye solution measuring device 4 using an algorithm in a memory installed therein or a separate memory to get calculate a concentration of the single dye solution, or concentrations of the dyes constituting the mixed dye solution and a concentration of the mixed dye solution to compare a calculated concentration of the single dye solution, or calculated concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution with a prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution shown in the prescribed recipe, thereby amounts of the dyes and water additionally fed into the single or mixed dye solution are calculated. The calculated amounts of the dyes and water are then displayed on a monitor 6.<br>
At this time, the concentration and pH of the single dye solution or the concentrations and pH of the dyes and mixed dye solution calculated by the central process and control unit 5, the prescribed concentration of the single dye solution or the prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution shown in the prescribed recipe, the concentration differences for the dyes and dye solution, and<br><br>
amounts of the dyes and water additionally fed into the dye solution are displayed on the monitor 6 and stored in a database 7<br>
As described above, the dyes and water are additionally fed into the single or mixed dye solution in the beaker or vessel by opening the solenoid valves installed at the tubes for connecting a beaker or a vessel containing the single or mixed dye solution to a tank for feeding the dyes and water into the beaker or vessel so as to allow the calculated concentration of the single dye solution, or calculated concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution to coincide with the prescribed concentration of the single dye solution, or prescribed concentrations of the dyes and mixed dye solution, thereby the dye solution having the same mixing ratio as the prescribed recipe is secured. Therefore, reproducibility of a subsequent dye is improved and the number of a re-dyeing is greatly reduced.<br>
A better understanding of the present invention may be obtained by reading the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed to limit the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
FIG.  5 illustrates results obtained from absorptivity of a mixed dye solution<br>
including three dyes measured by transmitting light to the mixed dye solution<br>
through the optical fibers 9a, 9b after the mixed dye solution is fed by a circulating<br>
pump into a first flow sensor 3a of a dye solution measuring system of FIG, 2, that<br>
is, a sensor in which quartz cells are attached to both ends of optical fibers 9a, 9b<br>
without diluting the mixed dye solution with water.<br>
In FIG. 5, prescribed concentrations of the three dyes (a yellow (001), a red (002),<br>
and a blue dye (003)) shown in a prescribed recipe were as follows: a concentration<br><br>
of the mixed dye solution was 1.500 g/l, and concentrations of the three dyes were respectively 0.500 g/l, 0.500 g/l, and 0.500 g/l. Additionally, the measured concentration of the mixed dye solution was 1.4838 g/l, and measured concentrations of the yellow, red, and blue dye were respectively 0.4810 g/l, 0.4986 g/l, and 0.5041 g/l. Furthermore, concentration differences between the measured and prescribed concentrations of the three dyes were -3.80 %, - 0.28 %, and 0.82 %, respectively.<br>
The amounts of the dyes (0.023 g, 0.006 g, and 0.000 g) and water (0.01 L) additionally added to the mixed dye solution are automatically calculated on the basis of a total amount of the dye solution and a dilution ratio in the case that the measured and prescribed concentrations of the three dyes are different from each other.<br>
Meanwhile, a color difference may occur between products of a workshop and samples of a laboratory even though a dyeing process in the workshop is conducted according to the prescribed recipe secured through a sample dyeing process in the laboratory. Various causes for the color difference may be suggested. For example, in the case of producing the dye solution according to a computer color kitchen (CCK) process, when the used dye solution is replaced with new one without the consideration of an inaccurate concentration of a CCK mother liquor, a life time of the mother liquor, and a dye lot difference, the color difference may occur. Additionally, the color difference may occur because the vaporization of the CCK mother liquor is promoted due to a high temperature and high humidity atmosphere in the laboratories of the dyeing companies, and a concentration of the mother liquor at a lower part of the mother liquor containing the dye solution is higher than an original concentration of the mother liquor while an upper part of the mother liquor without<br><br>
the dye solution is damp with dew due resulting from a condensation heat of steam. Further, a concentration difference may occur because different workers produce mother liquors even though the mother liquor is re-produced at regular intervals or the used mother liquor is properly replaced with new one according to an amount of the dye solution consumed.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
FIGS. 6, 7, and 8 illustrates results obtained from absorptivities of a yellow, a red, and a blue dye solution each having a concentration of 0.5 g/-E measured by transmitting light to the mixed dye solution through the optical fibers 9a, 9b after the mixed dye solution is fed by a circulating pump into a first flow sensor 3 a of a dye solution measuring system of FIG. 2, that is, a sensor in which quartz cells are attached to both ends of the optical fibers 9a, 9b without diluting the dye solution with water. At this time, the prescribed concentrations of the yellow, red, and blue dye were respectively 0.5 gAC, 0.5 g/l, and 0.5 g/l and the measured concentrations of them were respectively 0.5017 g/l, 0.5035 g/l9 and 0.5016 g/l. Hence, the concentration differences were 0.34 %, 0.70 %, and 0.32 %, and a measurement error was less than 1 %.<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, a CCK mother liquor is effectively controlled by measuring a concentration of a dye solution produced in a CCK process as well as a concentration of a single dye solution (CCK mother liquor), thereby a :olor difference occurring in producing the dye solution is avoided.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present invention has an advantage in<br><br>
that it is confirmed whether production of a dye solution in a workshop is desirably conducted or not on the basis of a prescribed recipe obtained from a laboratory to additionally feed dyes and water into the dye solution when a measured concentration of the dye solution is different from a prescribed concentration of the dye solution, thereby a color difference or a lot difference occurring in producing the dye solution is avoided.<br>
Other advantages of the present invention are that the number of re-dyeing attempts, the amount of water consumed, and an amount of pollutants are reduced by reducing a concentration difference of initial dye solutions of the laboratory and workshop, thereby productivity and quality of products are improved.<br>
To sum up, the present invention is advantageous in that 1) the color difference due to the concentration difference of dye solutions is avoided by comparing measured absorptivities of the dye solutions with prescribed absorptivities of the dye solutions to reduce the concentration difference, 2) the lot difference of dyes is easily confirmed by comparing a concentration of a standard dye solution with a concentration of a newly purchased dye solution, 3) a concentration of the dye solution is constantly maintained and an amount of the dye solution discharged from a circulating pipe can be precisely confirmed by checking a concentration of a mother liquor, and 4) concentrations of dye solutions in the case of a dip dyeing, a continuous dyeing, and a cold pad batch (CPB) dyeing are precisely measured, thereby a method of inspecting the concentrations of the dye solutions based on a prescribed recipe as a standard can be provided to revise the concentrations of the dye solutions when measured and prescribed concentrations of the dye solutions are different from each other. Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for<br><br>
