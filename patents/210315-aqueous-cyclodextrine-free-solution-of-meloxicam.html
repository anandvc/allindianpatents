COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"HIGHLY CONCENTRATED STABLE MELOXICAM SOLUTIONS"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM VETMEDICA GMBH, a German company, of Binger Strasse 173, 55216 Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to aqueous cyclodextrine-free solution of meloxicam.<br>
The present invention relates to highly concentrated stable meloxicam solutions for oral and parenteral administration, particularly for treating respiratory diseases in large farm animals.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Meloxicam (4-hydroxy-2-methyl-N-(5-methyl-2-thiazolyI)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxamide-1,1 -dioxide) is an active substance which belongs to the group of NSAID's (non-steroidal-antiinflammatory drugs). Meloxicam and the sodium and meglumine salt thereof (N-methyl-D-glucamine salt) are described in EP-A-0 002 482. EP-A-0 002 482 shows, inter alia, the example of a 0.2% injectable solution of meloxicam consisting of the meglumine salt of the active substance, sodium chloride and water.<br>
EP-A-0 945 134 discloses the pH-dependent solubility characteristics of meloxicam and its salts, i.e. the sodium salt, the ammonium salt and the meglumine salt, in aqueous solution. According to this, meloxicam is an active substance which does not dissolve readily in water. The meloxicam salts, particularly the meglumine salt, exhibit improved solubility as the pH increases between 4 and 10, as shown in Table 1 of EP-0 945 134. However, up till now it has only been possible to prodjuce stable, cleari aqueous'sQlutio^ wth a lo^ _w concentration of meloxicam. In addition to the in situ formation of a meloxicam salt, e.g. meglumine salt, and the addition of solubilisers, these solutions were required to have a pH in the range of maximum possible solubility as well as being reasonably well tolerated and contain a high proportion of organic solvent. Formulation tests with the same or a similar recipe led to cloudiness of the solution, e.g. if the meloxicam concentrations were higher, e.g. 2%.<br><br>
W09959634 A1 describes an eye drop solution containing 0.5% meloxicam but makes no reference to possible meloxicam concentrations over 1 %. A commercially available 0.5% meloxicam solution is used in small animals such as dogs, heifers and calves to treat respiratory diseases, for example.<br>
&gt; It has not hitherto been possible to treat large farm animals with an injectable meloxicam solution. The low concentration of active substance in the injectable solution did not allow an acceptable, well tolerated injection volume on account of the great weight of the animals. Parenteral administration requires that the<br>
i   solution be free from particles. If there are particles in a parenteral drug, there is a risk of vascular damage or embolism. Organic solvents, solubilisers and water-soluble substances can only be used in certain concentrations for reasons of drug tolerance. The problem of the present invention is to produce particle-free highly concentrated meloxicam solutions which are stable over long periods, suitable for<br>
\  treating farm animals up to 750 kg in weight. The solution should be suitable for administration both orally or parenterally.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that highly concentrated meloxicam solutions which contain, in addition to a meloxicam salt and certain excipients, another excipient selected from among citric acid, lecithin, gluconic acid, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid and EDTA or the salts thereof, may be produced so as to be particle-free and stable over long periods. The stability was achieved with an unexpectedly small amount of organic solubilisers. The formulation was found to be stable even when subjected to the process of final sterilisation.<br>
This results in the solution to the problem according to the invention, as a formulation of a meloxicam solution which contains, in addition to a meloxicam salt, small concentrations of solubiliser, a preservative, a buffer substance for achieving the optimum pH range and another excipient.<br><br>
The invention relates, as described in claim 1, to aqueous cyclodextrin-free solutions of meloxicam for parenteral or oral administration which contain a pharmacologically acceptable meloxicam salt of an organic or inorganic base in a highly concentrated solution with 11-25 mg/ml of meloxicam together with suitable excipients. Subclaims 2-14 describe advantageous further features of the invention.<br>
The formulation according to the invention overcomes the problem arising from the prior art of providing an injectable solution of the active substance meloxicam which is also suitable for treating large farm animals, by permitting a high concentration of active substance in a particle free solution which is stable over the long term, having the composition described hereinafter.<br>
The formulation according to the invention may contain, as the meloxicam salt, the meglumine, sodium, potassium or ammonium salt, preferably the meloxicam meglumine salt.<br>
