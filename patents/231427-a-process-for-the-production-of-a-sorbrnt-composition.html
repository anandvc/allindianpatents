				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to the removal of sulfur from fluid streams of<br>
cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels. In another aspect this invention relates to<br>
sorbent compositions suitable for use in the desulfurization of fluid streams of<br>
cracked-gasolines and diesel fuel. A further aspect of this invention relates to a<br>
process for the production of sulfur sorbents for use in the removal of sulfur bodies<br>
from fluid streams of cracked gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The need for cleaner burning fuels has resulted in a continuing world<br>
wide effort to reduce sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel fuels. The reducing of<br>
gasoline and diesel sulfur is considered to be a means for improving air quality<br>
because of the negative impact the fuel sulfur has on the performance of automotive<br>
catalytic converters. The presence of oxides of sulfur in automotive engine exhaust<br>
inhibits and may irreversibly poison noble metal catalysts in the converter.<br>
Emissions from an inefficient or poisoned converter contain levels of non-<br>
combusted, non-methane hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.<br>
Such emissions are catalyzed by sunlight to form ground level ozone, more<br>
commonly referred to as smog.<br>
Most of the sulfur in gasoline comes from the thermally processed<br>
gasolines. Thermally processed gasolines such, as for example, thermally cracked<br>
gasoline, visbreaker gasoline, coker gasoline and catalytically cracked gasoline<br>
(hereinafter collectively called "cracked-gasoline") contains in part olefins,<br>
aromatics, and sulfur-containing compounds.<br>
Since most gasolines, such as for example automobile gasolines,<br>
racing gasolines, aviation gasoline and boat gasolines contain a blend of at least in<br>
part cracked-gasoline, reduction of sulfur in cracked-gasoline will inherently serve<br>
to reduce the sulfur levels in such gasolines.<br>
The public discussion about gasoline sulfur has not centered on<br>
whether or not sulfur levels should be reduced. A consensus has emerged that<br>
lower sulfur gasoline reduces automotive emissions and improves air quality. Thus<br><br>
the real debate has focused on the required level of reduction, the geographical areas<br>
in need of lower sulfur gasoline and the time frame for implementation.<br>
As the concern over the impact of automotive air pollution continues,<br>
it is clear that further efforts to reduce the sulfur levels in automotive fuels will be<br>
required. While the current gasoline products contain about 330 part per million<br>
with continued efforts by the Environmental Protection Agency to secure reduced<br>
levels, it has been estimated that gasoline will have to have less than 50 part per<br>
million of sulfur by the year 2010. (See Rock, K.L., Putman H.M., Improvements<br>
in FCC Gasoline Desulfurization via Catalytic Distillation" presented at the 1998<br>
National Petroleum Refiners Association Annual Meeting (AM-98-37)).<br>
In view of the ever increasing need to be able to produce a low sulfur<br>
content automotive fuel, a variety of processes have been proposed for achieving<br>
industry compliance with the Federal mandates.<br>
One such process which has been proposed for the removal of sulfur<br>
from gasoline is called hydrodesulfurization. While hydrodesulfurization of gasoline<br>
can remove sulfur-containing compounds, it can result in the saturation of most, if<br>
not all, of the olefins contained in the gasoline. This saturation of olefins greatly<br>
affects the octane number (both the research and motor octane number) by lowering<br>
it. These olefins are saturated due to, in part, the hydrodesulfurization conditions<br>
required to remove thiophenic compounds (such as, for example, thiophene, benzo-<br>
thiophene, alkyl thiophenes, alkylbenzothiphenes and alkyl dibenzothiophenes),<br>
which are some of the most difficult sulfur-containing compounds to remove.<br>
Additionally, the hydrodesulfurization conditions required to remove thiophenic<br>
compounds can also saturate aromatics.<br>
In addition to the need for removal of sulfur from cracked-gasolines,<br>
there is also presented to the petroleum industry a need to reduce the sulfur content<br>
of diesel fuels. In removing sulfur from diesel by hydrodesulfurization, the cetane<br>
is improved but there is a large cost in hydrogen consumption. This hydrogen is<br>
consumed by both hydrodesulfurization and aromatic hydrogenation reactions.<br>
Thus there is a need for a process wherein desulfurization without<br>
hydrogenation of aromatics is achieved so as to provide a more economical process<br>
for the treatment of diesel fuels.<br><br>
As a result of the lack of success in providing successful and<br>
economically feasible processes for the reduction of sulfur levels in both<br>
cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels, it is apparent that there is still needed a<br>
better process for the desulfurization of both cracked-gasolines and diesel<br>
fuels which has minimal affect of octane while achieving high levels of<br>
sulfur removal.<br>
The present invention provides a novel sorbent system for the removal<br>
of sulfur from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the production of novel<br>
sorbents which are useful in the desulfurization of such fluid streams.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the removal of sulfur-<br>
containing compounds from cracked-gasolines and diesel fuels which<br>
minimize saturation of olefins and aromatics therein.<br>
The invention yet further provides a desulfurized cracked-gasoline<br>
that contains less than about 100 parts per million of sulfur based on the<br>
weight of the desulfurized cracked-gasoline and which contains essentially<br>
the same amount of olefins and aromatics as were in the cracked-gasoline<br>
from which it is made.<br><br>
Summany of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based upon our discovery that through the<br>
utilization of cobalt in a substantially reduced valence state, preferably zero,<br>
in a sorbent composition there is achieved a novel sorbent composition<br>
which permits the ready removal of sulfur from streams of cracked-gasolines<br>
or diesel fuels with a minimal effect on the octane rating of the treated<br>
stream.<br>
Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a novel sorbent suitable for the desulfurization of cracked-gasolines or diesel<br>
fuels which is comprised of zinc oxide, silica, alumina and cobalt wherein<br>
the valence of the cobalt is substantially reduced and such reduced valence<br>
cobalt is present in an amount to permit the removal of sulfur from cracked-<br>
gasolines or diesel fuels.<br>

(g)	calcining the dried particulate of step (f); and thereafter<br>
(h) reducing the resulting calcined particulate of step (g) with a suitable<br>
reducing agent under suitable conditions to produce a composition<br>
wherein the valence of essentially all of the cobalt therein is zero such<br>
that the reduced cobalt-containing composition will effect the removal<br>
of sulfur from a stream of cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel when said<br>
stream is contacted with said reduced cobalt-containing composition,<br>
wherein said zinc oxide is present in an amount in the range of from<br>
about 10 to about 90 weight percent, said silica is present in an<br>
amount in the range of about 5 to about 85 weight percent and said<br>
alumina is present in an amount in the range of from about 5 to about<br>
30 weight percent,<br>
wherein said particulate is impregnated with cobalt or a cobalt<br>
compound in an amount to provide a cobalt content therein in an<br>
amount in the range of from about 5 to about 50 weight percent,<br>
wherein said particulate is dried in steps ( c ) and ( f ) at a temperature<br>
in the range of about 65.5°C to about 177°C (about 150°F to about<br>
350°F),<br><br>
wherein said dried particulate is calcined in steps (d) and (g) at a<br>
temperature in the range of about 240°C to about 815.5°C (about<br>
400°F to about 1500°F).<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a process for the removal of sulfur from a stream of a cracked-<br>
gasoline or a diesel fuel which comprises:<br>
(a)	contacting said stream with a sorbent composition when produced<br>
by a process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, such that there is<br>

absorbed thereon;<br>
( d ) reducing the resulting desulfurized sorbent in an activation zone so as<br>
to provide a reduced valence cobalt content therein which will effect<br>
the removal of sulfur from a stream of a cracked-gasoline or diesel<br>

(e) returning at least a portion of the resulting desulfurized, reduced<br>
sorbent to said desulfurization zone.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The term "gasoline" as employed herein is intended to mean a<br>
mixture of hydrocarbons boiling from about 100°F to approximately 400°F<br>
or any fraction thereof. Such hydrocarbons will include, for example,<br>
hydrocarbon streams in refineries such as; naphtha, straight-run naphtha,<br>
coker naphtha, catalytic gasoline, visbreaker naphtha, alkylate, isomerate<br>
or reformate.<br>
The term "cracked-gasoline" as employed herein is intended to mean<br>
hydrocarbons boiling from about 100°F to approximately 400°F or any<br>
fraction thereof that are products from either thermal or catalytic processes<br>
that crack larger hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules. Examples<br>
of thermal processes include coking, thermal cracking and visbreaking.<br>
Fluid catalytic cracking and heavy oil cracking are examples of catalytic<br>
cracking. In some instances the cracked-gasoline may be fractionated<br>
and/or hydrotreated prior to desulfurization when used as a feed in the<br>
practice of this invention.<br><br>
The term "diesel fuel" as employed herein is intended to mean a fluid<br>
composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons boiling from about 300°F to approximately<br>
750°F or any fraction thereof. Such hydrocarbon streams include light cycle oil,<br>
kerosene, jet fuel, straight-run diesel and hydrotreated diesel.<br>
The term "sulfur" as employed herein is intended to mean those<br>
organosulfur compounds such as mercaptans or those thiophenic compounds<br>
normally present in cracked gasolines which include among others thiophene,<br>
benzothiophene, alkyl thiophenes, alkyl benzothiophenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes<br>
as well as the heavier molecular weights of same which are normally present in a<br>
diesel fuel of the types contemplated for processing in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
The term "gaseous" as employed herein is intended to mean that state<br>
in which the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel is primarily in a vapor phased<br>
The term "substantially reduced cobalt valence" as employed herein is<br>
intended to mean that a large portion of the valence of the cobalt component of the<br>
composition is reduced to a value of less than 3, preferably zero.<br>
The present invention is based upon the discovery of applicants that a<br>
substantially reduced valence cobalt component in a particulate composition<br>
comprising zinc oxide, silica, alumina and cobalt results in a sorbent which permits<br>
the removal of thiophenic sulfur compounds from fluid streams of cracked-gasolines<br>
or diesel fuels without having a significant adverse affect of the olefin content of<br>
such streams, thus avoiding a significant reduction of octane values of the treated<br>
stream. Moreover, the use of such novel sorbents results in a significant reduction<br>
of the sulfur content of the resulting treated fluid stream.<br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the sorbent<br>
composition has a cobalt content in the range of from about 5 to about 50 weight<br>
percent.<br>
The zinc oxide used in the preparation of the sorbent composition can<br>
either be in the form of zinc oxide, or in the form of one or more zinc compounds<br>
that are convertible to zinc oxide under the conditions of preparation described<br>
herein. Examples of such zinc compounds include, but are not limited to, zinc<br>
sulfide, zinc sulfate, zinc hydroxide, zinc carbonate, zinc acetate, and zinc nitrate.<br><br>
Preferably, the zinc oxide is in the form of powdered zinc oxide.<br>
The silica used in the preparation of the sorbent compositions may be<br>
either in the form of silica or in the form of one or more silicon-containing<br>
compounds. Any suitable type of silica may be employed in the sorbent<br>
compositions of the present invention. Examples of suitable types of silica include<br>
diatomite, silicalite, silica colloid, flame-hydrolyzed silica, hydrolyzed silica, silica<br>
gel and precipitated silica, with diatomite being presently preferred. In addition,<br>
silicon compounds that are convertible to silica such as silicic acid, sodium silicate<br>
and ammonium silicate can also be employed. Preferably, the silica is in the form<br>
of diatomite.<br>
The starting alumina component of the composition can be any<br>
suitable commercially available alumina material including colloidal alumina<br>
solutions and, generally, those alumina compounds produced by the dehydration of<br>
alumina hydrates.<br>
The zinc oxide will generally be present in the sorbent composition in<br>
an amount in the range of from about 10 weight percent to about 90 weight percent,<br>
preferably in an amount in the range of from about 15 to about 60 weight percent,<br>
and more preferably in an amount in the range of from about 45 to about 60 weight<br>
percent, when such weight percents are expressed in terms of the zinc oxide based<br>
upon the total weight of the sorbent composition.<br>
The silica will generally be present in the sorbent composition in an<br>
amount in the range of from about 5 weight percent to about 85 weight percent,<br>
preferably in an amount in the range of from about 20 weight percent to about 60<br>
weight percent when the weight percents are expressed in terms of the silica based<br>
upon the total weight of the sorbent composition.<br>
The alumina will generally be present in the sorbent composition in<br>
an amount in the range of from about 5.0 weight percent to about 30 weight<br>
percent, preferably from about 5.0 weight percent to about 15 weight percent when<br>
such weight percents are expressed in terms of the weight of the alumina compared<br>
with the total weight of the sorbent system.<br>
In the manufacture of the sorbent composition, the primary<br>
components of zinc oxide, silica and alumina are combined together in appropriate<br><br>
proportions by any suitable manner which provides for the intimate mixing of the<br>
components to provide a substantially homogeneous mixture.<br>
Any suitable means for mixing the sorbent components can be used<br>
to achieve the desired dispersion of the materials. Such means include, among<br>
others, tumblers, stationary shells or troughs, Muller mixers, which are of the batch<br>
or continuous type, impact mixers and the like. It is presently preferred to use a<br>
Muller mixer in the mixing of the silica, alumina and zinc oxide components.<br>
Once the sorbent components are properly mixed to provide a<br>
shapeable mixture, the resulting mixture can be in the form of wet mix, dough,<br>
paste or slurry. If the resulting mix is in the form of a wet mix, the wet mix can be<br>
densified and thereafter particulated through the granulation of the densified mix.<br>
following the drying and calcination of same. When the admixture of zinc oxide,<br>
silica and alumina results in a form of the mixture which is either in a dough state<br>
or paste state, the mix can be shaped to form a particulate granule, extrudate, tablet,<br>
sphere, pellet or microsphere. Presently preferred are cylindrical exrudates having<br>
from 1/32 inch to 1/2 inch diameter and any suitable length. The resulting<br>
particulate is then dried and then calcined. When the mix is in the form of a slurry,<br>
the particulation of same is achieved by spray drying the slurry to form micro-<br>
spheres thereof having a size of from about 20 to about 500 microns. Such micro-<br>
spheres are then subjected to drying and calcination. Following the drying and<br>
calcination of the particulated mixture, the resulting particulates can be impregnated<br>
with cobalt oxide compound or a cobalt oxide precursor.<br>
Following the impregnation of the particulate compositions with the<br>
appropriate cobalt compound, the resulting impregnated particulate is then subjected<br>
to drying and calcination prior to the subjecting of the calcined particulate to<br>
reduction with a reducing agent, preferably hydrogen.<br>
The elemental cobalt, cobalt oxide or cobalt-containing compound<br>
can be added to the particulated mixture by impregnation of the mixture with a<br>
solution, either aqueous or organic, that contains the elemental cobalt, cobalt oxide<br>
or cobalt-containing compound. In general, the impregnation with the cobalt is<br>
carried out so as to form a resulting particulate composition of zinc oxide, silica,<br>
alumina and the cobalt metal, cobalt oxide or cobalt oxide precursor prior to the<br><br>
drying and calcination of the resulting impregnated composition.<br>
The impregnation solution is any aqueous solution and amounts of<br>
such solution which suitably provides for the impregnation of the mixture of zinc<br>
oxide, silica and alumina to give an amount of cobalt oxide in the final zinc oxide<br>
based composition to provide when reduced a reduced cobalt metal content<br>
sufficient to permit the removal of sulfur from streams of cracked-gasoline or diesel<br>
fuels when so treated with same in accordance with the process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Once the cobalt, cobalt oxide or cobalt oxide precursor has been<br>
incorporated into the particulate calcined zinc oxide, alumina and silica mixture, the<br>
desired reduced valence cobalt metal sorbent is <br>
composition followed by calcination and thereafter subjecting the resulting calcined<br>
composition to reduction with a suitable reducing agent, preferably hydrogen, so as<br>
to produce a composition having a substantial zero valence cobalt content therein<br>
with such zero valence cobalt content being present in an amount to permit the<br>
removal with same of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream.<br>
The solid reduced cobalt metal sorbent of this invention is a<br>
composition that has the ability to react with and/or chemisorb with organo-sulfur<br>
compounds, such as thicphenic compounds. It is also preferable that the sorbent<br>
removes diolefins and other gum forming compounds from the cracked-gasoline.<br>
The solid reduced metal sorbent of this invention is comprised of<br>
cobalt that is in a substantially reduced valence state, preferably a zero valence state.<br>
Presently the reduced metal is cobalt. The amount of reduced cobalt in the solid<br>
cobalt reduced metal sorbents of this invention is that amount which will permit the<br>
removal of sulfur from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream. Such amounts<br>
are generally in the range of from about 5 to about 50 weight percent of the total<br>
weight of cobalt in the sorbent composition. Presently it is preferred that the<br>
reduced cobalt metal be present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to<br>
about 40 weight percent of the total weight of cobalt in the sorbent composition.<br>
In one presently preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
reduced cobalt is present in an amount in the range of from about 15 to 30 weight<br>
percent and the cobalt component has been substantially reduced to zero valence.<br><br>
In another presently preferred embodiment of this invention, zinc<br>
oxide is present in an amount of about 38 weight percent, silica is present in an<br>
amount of about 31 weight percent, alumina is present in an amount of about<br>
8 weight percent and cobalt is present prior to reduction to zero valence in an<br>
amount of about 33 weight percent cobalt oxide.<br>
From the above, it can be appreciated that the sorbent compositions<br>
which are useful in the desulfurization process of this invention can be prepared by<br>
a process which comprises:<br>
(a)	admixing zinc oxide, silica and alumina so as to form a mix of<br>
same in the form of one of a wet mix, dough, paste or slurry;<br>
(b)	particulating the resulting resulting mix to form HBrparticulates thereof in the<br>
form of one of granules, extrudates, tablets, pellets, spheres or microspheres;<br>
(c)	drying the resulting particulate;<br>
(d)	calcining the dried particulate;<br>
(e)	impregnating the resulting calcined particulate with cobalt, cobalt<br>
oxide or a precursor for cobalt;<br>
(f)	drying the impregnated particulate;<br>
(g)	calcining the resulting dried particulate; and<br>
(h) reducing the calcined particulate product of (g) with a suitable<br>
reducing agent so as to produce a particulate composition having a substantial<br>
reduced valence cobalt content therein and wherein the reduced valence cobalt<br>
content is present in an amount sufficient to permit the removal with same of sulfur<br>
from a cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel fluid stream when contacted with the<br>
resulting substantially reduced valence cobalt particulated sorbent.<br>
The process to use the novel sorbents to desulfurize cracked-gasoline<br>
or diesel fuels to provide a desulfurized cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel comprises:<br>
(a)	desulfurizing in a desulfurization zone a cracked-gasoline or<br>
diesel fuel with a solid reduced cobalt metal-containing sorbent;<br>
(b)	separating the desulfurized cracked-gasoline or desulfurized<br>
diesel fuel from the resulting sulfurized solid reduced cobalt-containing sorbent;<br>
(c)	regenerating at least a portion of the sulfurized solid reduced<br>
cobalt-containing sorbent to produce a regenerated desulfurized solid cobalt-<br><br>
containing sorbent;<br>
(d)	reducing at least a portion of the regenerated desulfurized solid<br>
cobalt-containing sorbent to produce a solid reduced cobalt-containing sorbent<br>
thereafter and;<br>
(e)	returning at least a portion of the regenerated solid reduced<br>
cobalt-containing sorbent to the desulfurization zone.<br>
The desulfurization step (a) of the present invention is carried out<br>
under a set of conditions that includes total pressure, temperature, weight hourly<br>
space velocity and hydrogen flow. These conditions are such that the solid reduced<br>
cobalt-containing sorbent can desulfurize the cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel to<br>
produce a desetnirized cracked-gasoline or desulfurized diesel fuel and a sulfurized- -<br>
sorbent.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurization step of the process of the present<br>
invention, it is preferred that the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel be in a vapor<br>
phase. However, in the practice of the invention it is not essential, albeit preferred,<br>
that the feed be totally in a vapor or gaseous state.<br>
The total pressure can be in the range of about 15 psia to about<br>
1500 psia. However, it is presently preferred that the total pressure be in a range of<br>
from about 50 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
In general, the temperature should be sufficient to keep the cracked-<br>
gasoline or diesel fuel essentially in a vapor phase. While such temperatures can be<br>
in the range of from about 100°F to about 1000°F, it is presently preferred that the<br>
temperature be in the range of from about 400°F to about 800°F when treating as<br>
cracked-gasoline and in the range of from about 500°F to about 900°F when the<br>
feed is a diesel fuel.<br>
Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is defined as the pounds of<br>
hydrocarbon feed per pound of sorbent in the desulfurization zone per hour. In the<br>
practice of the present invention, such WHSV should be in the range of from about<br>
0.5 to about 50, preferably about 1 to about 20 hr'.<br>
In carrying out the desulfurization step, it is presently preferred that<br>
an agent be employed which interferes with any possible chemisorbing or reacting<br>
of the olefinic and aromatic compounds in the fluids which are being treated with<br><br>
the solid reduced cobalt-containing sorbent. Such an agent is presently preferred to<br>
be hydrogen.<br>
Hydrogen flow in the desulfurization zone is generally such that the<br>
mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrocarbon feed is the range of about 0.1 to about 10,<br>
and preferably in the range of about 0.2 to about 3.0.<br>
The desulfurization zone can be any zone wherein desulfurization of<br>
the feed cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel can take place. Examples of suitable zones<br>
are fixed bed reactors, moving bed reactors, fluidized bed reactors and transport<br>
reactors. Presently, a fluidized bed reactor or a fixed bed reactor is preferred.<br>
If desired, during the desulfurization of the vaporized fluids, diluents<br>
such as methane, carbon dioxide, flue gas and nitrogen can be used. Thus it is not<br>
essential to the practice of the process of the present invention that a high purity<br>
hydrogen be employed in achieving the desired desulfurization of the cracked-<br>
gasoline or diesel fuel.<br>
It is presently preferred when utilizing a fluidized system that a solid<br>
reduced cobalt sorbent be used that has a particle size in the range of about 20 to<br>
about 1000 micrometers. Preferably, such sorbents should have a particle size of<br>
from about 40 to about 500 micrometers. When a fixed bed system is employed for<br>
the practice of the desulfurization process of this invention, the sorbent should be<br>
such as to have a particle size in the range of about 1/32 inch to about 1/2 inch<br>
diameter.<br>
It is further presently preferred to use solid reduced cobalt sorbents<br>
that have a surface area of from about 1 square meter per gram to about 1000<br>
square meters per gram of solid sorbent.<br>
The separation of the gaseous or vaporized desulfurized fluids and<br>
sulfurized sorbent can be accomplished by any means known in the art that can<br>
separate a solid from a gas. Examples of such means are cyclonic devices, settling<br>
chambers or other impingement devices for separating solids and gases. The<br>
desulfurized gaseous cracked-gasoline or desulfurized diesel fuel can then be<br>
recovered and preferably liquefied.<br>
The gaseous cracked-gasoline or gaseous diesel fuel is a composition<br>
that contains in part, olefins, aromatics and sulfur-containing compounds as well as<br><br>
paraffins and naphthenes.<br>
The amount of olefins in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in the<br>
range of from about 10 to 35 weight percent based on the weight of the gaseous<br>
cracked-gasoline. For diesel fuel there is essentially no olefin content.<br>
The amount of aromatics in gaseous cracked-gasoline is generally in<br>
the range of about 20 to about 40 weight percent based on the weight of the<br>
gaseous cracked gasoline. The amount of aromatics in gaseous diesel fuel is<br>
generally in the range of about 10 to about 90 weight percent.<br>
The amount of sulfur in cracked-gasolines or diesel fuels can range<br>
from about 100 parts per million sulfur by weight of the gaseous cracked-gasoline<br>
to about-10,000 parts per million sulfur by weight of the gaseous cracked gasolinc<br>
and from about 100 parts per million to about 50,000 parts per million for diesel<br>
fuel prior to the treatment of such fluids with the sorbent system of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The amount of sulfur in cracked-gasolines or in diesel fuels following<br>
treatment of same in accordance with the desulfurization process of this invention is<br>
less than 100 parts per million.<br>
In carrying out the process of this invention, if desired, a stripper unit<br>
can be inserted before the regenerator for regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent<br>
which will serve to remove a portion, preferably all, of any hydrocarbons from the<br>
sulfurized sorbent or before the hydrogen reduction zone so as to remove oxygen<br>
and sulfur dioxide from the system prior to introduction of the regenerated sorbent<br>
into the sorbent activation zone. The stripping comprises a set of conditions that<br>
includes total pressure, temperature and stripping agent partial pressure.<br>
Preferably the total pressure in a stripper, when employed, is in a<br>
range of from about 25 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
The temperature for such strippers can be in the range of from about<br>
100°F to about 1000°F.<br>
The stripping agent is a composition that helps to remove hydro-<br>
carbons from the sulfurized solid sorbent. Presently, the preferred stripping agent is<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The sorbent regeneration zone employs a set of conditions such that<br><br>
at least a portion of the sulfurized sorbent is desulfurized.<br>
The total pressure in the regeneration zone is generally in the range<br>
of from about 10 to about 1500 psia. Presently preferred is a total pressure in the<br>
range of from about 25 psia to about 500 psia.<br>
The sulfur removing agent partial pressure is generally in the range of<br>
from about 1 percent to about 25 percent of the total pressure.<br>
The sulfur removing agent is a composition that helps to generate<br>
gaseous sulfur oxygen-containing compounds such a sulfur dioxide, as well as to<br>
bum off any remaining hydrocarbon deposits that might be present. Currently,<br>
oxygen-containing gases such as air are the preferred sulfur removing agent.<br>
The temperature in the regeneration zone is generally from about <br>
100°F to about 1500°F with a temperature in the range of about 800°F to about<br>
1200°F being presently preferred.<br>
The regeneration zone can be any vessel wherein the desulfurizing or<br>
regeneration of the sulfurized sorbent can take place.<br>
The desulfurized sorbent is then reduced in an activation zone with a<br>
reducing agent so that at least a portion of the cobalt content of the sorbent<br>
composition is reduced to produce a solid cobalt reduced metal sorbent having an<br>
amount of reduced metal therein to permit the removal of sulfur components from a<br>
stream of cracked-gasoline or diesel fuel.<br>
In general, when practicing the process of this invention, the<br>
reduction of the desulfurized solid cobalt-containing sorbent is carried out at a<br>
temperature in the range of about 100°F to about 1500°F and a pressure in the<br>
range of about 15 to 1500 psia. Such reduction is carried out for a time sufficient<br>
to achieve the desired level of cobalt reduction in the sorbent system. Such<br>
reduction can generally be achieved in a period of from about 0.01 to about<br>
20 hours.<br>
Following the activation of the regenerated particulate sorbent, at<br>
least a portion of the resulting activated (reduced) sorbent can be returned to the<br>
desulfurization unit.<br>
When carrying out the process of the present invention in a fixed bed<br>
system, the steps of desulfurization, regeneration, stripping, and activation are<br><br>
accomplished in a single zone or vessel.<br>
The desulfurized cracked-gasoline resulting from the practice of the<br>
present invention can be used in the formulation of gasoline blends to provide<br>
gasoline products suitable for commercial consumption.<br>
The desulfurized diesel fuels resulting from the practice of the present<br>
invention can likewise be used for commercial consumption where a low<br>
sulfur-containing fuel is desired.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present<br>
invention and to teach one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the<br>
invention. These examples are not-intended tc*4i»»t the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
A solid reduced cobalt metal sorbent was produced by dry mixing<br>
20.02 pounds of diatomite silica and 25.03 zinc oxide in a mix Muller for<br>
15 minutes to produce a first mixture. While still mixing, a solution containing<br>
6.38 pounds of Disperal alumina (Condea), 22.5 pounds of deionized water and<br>
316 grams of glacial acetic acid were added to the mix Muller to produce a second<br>
mixture. After adding these components, mixing continued for an additional<br>
30 minutes. This second mixture was then dried at 300°F for 16 hours and then<br>
calcined at 1175°F for one hour to form a third mixture. This third mixture was<br>
then particulalized by granulation using a Stokes Pennwalt granulator fitted with a<br>
50 mesh screen. 200 grams of the resulting granulated mix was then impregnated<br>
with 148 grams of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 43 grams of hot (200°F)<br>
deionized water to produce a particulate impregnated mix. The impregnated<br>
particulate was dried at 300°F for one hour and then calcined at 1175°F for one<br>
hour. 100 grams of the calcined particulate was impregnated with a solution of<br>
74 grams of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate dissolved in 8 grams of hot deionized water<br>
to produce an impregnated particulate product which was then dried at 300°F for<br>
one hour and then calcined at 1175°F for one hour to form a solid cobalt oxide<br>
sorbent.<br>
The solid cobalt oxide sorbent was then reduced by subjecting it to a<br>
temperature of 700°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and a hydrogen partial pressure of<br><br>
15 psi for 30 minutes to produce a solid reduced cobalt sorbent wherein the cobalt<br>
component of the sorbent composition was substantially reduced to a zero valence<br>
state.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
The solid reduced cobalt sorbent as prepared in Example I was tested<br>
for its desulfurization ability as follows.<br>
A one inch quartz reactor tube was loaded with the indicated amounts<br>
of the sorbent of Example I. This solid reduced cobalt sorbent was placed on a frit<br>
in the middle of the reactor. Gaseous cracked-gasoline having about 345 pans per<br>
million sulfur by weight of the sulfur-containing compounds based on the weight of<br>
the gasedus cracked-gasoline and having about 95 weight percent thiophenic<br>
compounds (such as for example, alkyl benzothiphenes, alkyl thiophenes,<br>
benzothiophene and thiophene) based on the weight of sulfur-containing compounds<br>
in the gaseous cracked-gasoline was pumped upwardly through the reactor. The rate<br>
was 13.4 milliliters per hour. This produced sulfurized solid sorbent and<br>
desulfurized gaseous cracked-gasoline.<br>
In Run 1, hydrogen was added to the gasoline feed at a partial<br>
pressure of 6.6 psi (out of a total pressure of 15 psi) resulting in a reduction in<br>
gasoline sulfur to 15-25 parts per million.<br>
After Run 1, the sulfurized sorbent was subjected to regeneration<br>
conditions that included a temperature of 900°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and an<br>
oxygen partial pressure of 0.6 to 3.1 psi for a period of 1-2 hours. Such conditions<br>
are hereinafter referred to as "regeneration conditions" to produce a desulfurized<br>
cobalt-containing sorbent. This sorbent was then subjected to reducing conditions<br>
that included a temperature of 700°F, a total pressure of 15 psia and a hydrogen<br>
partial pressure of 15 psi for a time period of 0.5 hours. Such conditions are<br>
hereinafter referred to as "reducing conditions".<br>
In the next series of runs (2-6), after each run the sulfurized sorbent<br>
was subjected to regeneration and reducing conditions as described above.<br>
Runs 2 and 3 were essentially repeats of Run 1 indicating that the<br>
sorbent can be regenerated to a fresh state where it can reduce the sulfur content of<br>
cracked-gasoline to about 5 parts per million.<br><br>
A composite of product gasoline from each of the Runs 1 and 2 was<br>
subjected to a test to determine its research octane number (RON), using a method<br>
as described in ASTM 2699 procedure entitled "Research Octane Number of<br>
Sparked Ignition Engine Fuel". The RON for the products from Runs 1 and 2 was<br>
91.4 as compared to the RON of 91.1 for the cracked-gasoline feed, indicating that<br>
the octane of the cracked-gasoline was not affected by carrying out the inventive<br>
desulfurization process.<br>
In Runs 4-7, the effect of hydrogen partial pressure was studied. As<br>
the hydrogen partial pressure is reduced (Run 4), the ability of the sorbent to<br>
desulfurize cracked-gasoline diminished. When no hydrogen is used in the process<br>
(Run 5), very little reduction in the sulfur content is effected.When the hydrogen<br>
partial pressure was increased to 13.2, the sorbent essentially reduced the cracked-<br>
gasoline to less than 5 parts per million.<br>
Run 7 was a repeat of Runs 1-3 and indicates that even after repeated<br>
cycles of desulfurization, regeneration and reduction or activation, the ability of the<br>
sorbent to remove sulfur from cracked gasoline did not diminish, for example<br>
compare Run 1 to Run 7.<br>
The results of this series of runs is set forth in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
