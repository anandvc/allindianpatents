The present invention refers to compositions comprising a peptide and polylacllc-glycollc acid suitable for the preparation of subcutaneous implants. Prior art<br>
Compositions made up of mixtures of a drug with a polymer of lactic acid or a<br>
polymer of glycolic acid or with a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid, as<br>
described in the U.S. patent 3.773.919 (Du Pont) are well known .<br>
These compositions are indicated for potential administration and have the<br>
characteristics of releasing effective quantities of the drug over a set period of<br>
time.<br>
The drug and the polymeric substance can be combined in accordance with any of<br>
the known techniques or the particles of the drug can be coated in the polymer<br>
operating In accordance with known techniques.<br>
The U.S. patent 4.767.628 (ICI) describes compositions containing a peptide and<br>
a polymer of lactic acid or a copolymer of lactic acid and giycolic ackl.<br>
When preparing the compositions, the pestle and the (oo)polymer are dissolved<br>
in a solvent which can be the same or different for the two substances, for<br>
Example dioxane or water, and then the two solutions are mixed.<br>
The subsequent operations consist of removing the solvent at low temperature<br>
and in extruding the powder obtained in this  way.<br>
In this way a composition in the form of cylinders is obtained in which the peptide<br>
is distributed homogeneously throughout the polymer.<br>
It is already known from the U.S. patent 5.366.734 (Zeneca) that the compositions<br>
covered by the U.S. patent 4.767.628 referred to above can be used In preparing<br>
subcutaneous implants.<br>
The polymer of lactic acid and the copolymer of lactic acid and giycolic acid are<br>
incompatible with the peptide therefore diffusion of the peptide through the<br>
polymer is impossible.<br>
When these implants are introduced into a buffer solution at 37 °C, the water<br><br>
peptides over a limited period of time, generally of around 3 months.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The applicant has now found compositions suitable for preparing subcutaneous<br>
implants which allow the active substance to be released over a period of time of<br>
at least 6 months.<br>
These compositions consist of a polylactlc-glycollc add (PLGA) and a peptide and<br>
have the characteristic of distributing  peptide particles In the PLGA whose<br>
dimensions, under microscopic examination, are extremely heterogeneous, with<br>
peptide particles of diameter of between 1 and 60 micrometers dispersed In the<br>
polymer matrix.<br>
These and other characteristics of the compositions In accordance with the<br>
invention and the process for preparing them will be illustrated in greater depth in<br>
the following detailed description.<br>

Detailed description of the Invention<br>
This invention refers to compositions consisting of polylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA)<br><br>
implants.<br>
This difficulty cannot be overcome by using the known techniques of mixing by<br>
dissolving in a solvent shared by the two compounds or in one solvent for one of<br>
the two  compounds, nor by means of the techniques for mixing In the melted state.<br>
This difficulty has been resolved In this invention by means of wet granulation of<br>
the PLGA with the peptide. This operation and the subsequent operations allow<br>
the initial heterogeneity of the peptide particles to be retained.<br>
The Invention also refers to the process for preparing these compositions and to<br>
the aforementioned subcutaneous implants.<br>
One such process Is a wet granulation process.<br>
This process consists of the following stages:<br>
a)	the peptide in the form of particles having a diameter of between 1 and 60 micrometers is homogeneously mixed when dry with PLGA in the form of particles whose granulometry is between 10 to 150, preferably 50 and 150, micrometres;<br>
b)	the mixture obtained from stage a) is granulated using wet granulation by adding a suitable liquid, for example ethanol or water,<br>
c)	the granulate is then dried until the residual liquid content Is 0.1-3.0%, preferably 0.5-2.0% by weight. This liquid content is fundamental in that it gives the granule sufficient cohesion to prevent the constituents of the mixture from separating during subsequent treatments:<br>
d)	the mixture obtained from stage c) is extruded. Exposure time in the extruder is from between 1 and 10, preferably between 4 and 6 minutes, with a temperature profile which ranges from 20°C, preferably 30°C. on entering the extruder to no higher than 120'C. preferably 110°C, on leaving the extruder. Under these conditions the PLGA melts forming a continuous matrix which coats the  peptide particles while maintaining the heterogeneous nature of these partied dimensions.<br>
e)	the cylinders produced from extension may be slightly stretched and then cut to obtain dimensions suitable for the subcutaneous implants, namely a diameter of between 1.0 and 1.7, preferably between 1.3 and 1.5 mm, and a length of between 10 and 30, preferably between 16 and 24 mm;<br>
f)	finally, if needed, the cylinders obtained from stage e) are sterilised.<br>
Suitable polylactic-glycolic acid copolymers for use in the invention have molecular<br><br>
The peptide released during in vitro and in vivo trials takes place over a time<br>
period of at least 6 months.<br>
However the overall time for releasing the peptide can be controlled by varying the<br>
diameter and the length of the implant<br>
Clinical trials conducted using subcutaneous implants in accordance with this<br>
invention  in  patients  with  prostate  tumours  have   shown  the  testosterone<br>
suppression within 4 weeks with this effect lasting from approximately 7 months to<br>
approximately 12 months.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following Examples are quoted.<br>
Example 1<br>
10 grams of avoreline were mixed thoroughly with 30 grams of polylactic-giycotic<br>
acid (PLGA).<br>
The avoreline had the following characteristics:<br>
•	acid-alkalimetric titer: 88.1 % by weight;<br>
•	pKa: 6.15-9.70-12.02;<br>
•	granulometric distribution: between 1 and 60 micrometres. The PLGA had the following characteristics:<br>
•	molecular weight of 116,500 O;<br>
•	molar ratio between lactic monomer and glycol monomer. 70: 30;<br>
•	intrinsic viscosity {CHCI3); 0.98 dl/g measured at 25°C,<br>
•	granulometric distribution: In 90% of cases between 50 and 150 micrometers. The mixture obtained was granulated wet by adding 16 ml of ethanol using a 16mm grid.<br>
The granulate obtained was desiccated for 12 hours at a temperature of 25'C in a<br>
cunent of dry air.<br>
After drying the ethanol content In the granulate was 0.66% by weight.<br>
Finally the granulate was extruded using an extruder with a die head of diameter<br>
1.5 mm and length 17.55 mm.<br>
The speed of rotation of the screws was 5 rev/minute and the temperature was<br>
30-0 on entering the extruder and 100X on leaving the extruder.<br>
The cylinder obtained by the extrusion was slightly stretched and then cut into<br>
segments of length 18 mm which were finally radiosteritised. In this way implants<br><br>
The results are shown in Figure 3 in which in the X-axis shows the time expressed<br>
in days and the Y-axis shows the cumulative quantity of avoreline released<br>
expressed in mg.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated, with the difference that implants were produced with a<br>
diameter of 1.5 mm, length 15 mm and avoreline content of 20.9% by weight.<br>
Microscopic examination produced similar results to Example 1. The results of the<br>
in vitro release test are shown In Figure 4 in which the parameters are the same<br>
as those in Figure 3.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the difference that PLGA having a molecular weight<br>
of 121,900 D was used and implants were prepared having a diameter of 1.5 mm,<br>
length 18 mm and avoreline content of 27.9% by weight.<br>
Microscopic examination and the release test produced similar results to Example<br>
1.<br>
Example 4<br>
9 grams of avoreline were mixed thoroughly with 24g of polylactic-glycolic acid<br>
(PLGA).<br>
The avoreline had the following characteristics:<br>
«   acid-alkalimetric titer: 90.1 % by weight;<br>
•	pKa:e.15 -9.70-12.02:<br>
•	granulometiic distribution: between 1 and 60 micrometres. The PLGA had the following characteristics:<br>
•	molecular weight: 121,900 D;<br>
•	molar ratio between lactic monomer and glycolic monomer 70: 30;<br>
•	granulometric distribution: in 90% of cases between 50 and 150 micrometres. The mixture obtained was granulated wet by adding 6 ml of water using a 1.6mm grid.<br>
The granulate obtained was desiccated for 12 hours at a temperature of 25 °C in a<br>
current of dry air.<br>
After drying the water content In the granulate was 1.8% by weight.<br>
Extrusion and the subsequent operations were conducted as in Example 1.<br><br>
Microscopic examination and the release test prexjuced similar results to Example<br>
1.<br>
Clinical experimentation<br>
Clinical trials were conducted in 60 patients suffering from prostate tumours, using<br>
subcutaneous implants prepared in accordance with this invention.<br>
A group of patients was treated with implants having an avoreline content of 10 mg<br>
and a second group was treated virith Implants having an avoreline content of 15<br>
mg.<br>
The results of the experiments are shown in Figures 5 to 8.<br>
The graphs for these Figures can be interpreted as follows:<br>
•	Graph a) represents the average plasma concentration of the FSH;<br>
•	Graph b) represents the average plasma concentration of testosterone;<br>
•	Graph c) represents the average plasma concentration of LH;<br>
•	Graph d) represents the average plasma concentration of avoreline;<br>
•	line e) is the line of castration with reference to testosterone.<br>
Figure 5 and Figure 7 refer to the use of implants having an avoreline content of<br>
10 mg while Figures 6 and 8 refer to the use of implants having an avoreline<br>
content of 15 mg.<br>
With  reference  to  Figures  5  and  6, the  left ordinate  shows  the  plasma<br>
concentration of LH and FSIH expressed in lU/L and the right ordinate shows the<br>
plasma concentration of testosterone expressed in nmol/L.<br>
With reference to  Figures 7 and 8, the left ordinate shows  the  piasma<br>
concentration of avoreline expressed in pg/mL and the right ordinate shows the<br>
plasma concentration of testosterone expressed in nmol/L.<br>
in alt the Figures, the time from implant Insertion, expressed in weeks, Is shown on<br>
the X-axis.<br>
As can be seen from these Figures, using the implants in accordance with this<br>
invention, testosterone is suppressed within four weeks after the Implant Is<br>
inserted with this effect lasting for a period of between approximately seven<br>
months and approximately twelve months.<br>
The plasma concentrations whirfi can be determined for avoreline were measured<br>
for approximately 6 months after Inserting the implant.<br><br>
penetrates and diffuses in the implant and Js distributed between ttie polymer and<br>
the peptide forming regions of hydrated peptides.<br>
The first stage in releasing the peptide described in the U.S. patent 5.366.734 is a<br>
stage of diffusion caused by the polymer swelling.<br>
When the polymer swells this allows channels of hydrated peptide to form where<br>
the peptide diffuses to the surface.<br>
If swelling stops, the peptide is no longer released.<br>
The second stage of release is caused by the polymer matrix degrading.<br>
During this stage holes and cractcs form in the matrix which allow the release of<br>
the hydrated peptides which are still isolated in ttie matrix.<br>
The total release time Is limited to the sum of the release times for each stage.<br>
However the maximum release time observed is in the order of three months.<br>
In the application for intemational patent WO 98/0g613 (Deghenghi) a process for<br>
preparing subcutaneous implants capable of releasing bioacUve peptides is<br>
descrit&gt;ed.<br>
This process consists of the following stages:<br>
•	milling a copolymer of lactic add and glycolic acid,<br>
•	wetbng the copolymer with an aqueous slurry of a peptide (In the Examples an aqueous solution of avoraline acetate is used):<br>
•	mixing this copolymer with the aforementioned sluny so as to obtain a homogeneous mixture;<br>
•	drying this mixture at a temperature of no higher than 25°C;<br>
•	extnjding the mixture at 70-110*0 in order to obtain small extruded cylinders suitable for use as subcutaneous implants.<br>
This process cannot be carried out using industrial methods because it is not<br>
possible to sufficiently eliminate water from the mixture. The results declared in<br>
WO 98/109613 cannot therefore be reproduced.<br>
However the fundamental characteristic of the compositions for subcutaneous<br>
implants in the patents referred to above consists of the homogeneous distribution<br>
of the peptide in the polymeric substance, resulting from using a solution of at<br>
least one of the two components.<br>
The implants currently on the marttet have the disadvantage of releasing the<br><br>
and a peptide suitable for the preparation of long-release subcutaneous implants.<br>
The implants prepared from compositons in accordance with this invention consist<br>
of a PLGA matrix of a high molecular weight incorporating a peptide in the form  of<br>
particles having extremely heterogeneous dimensions.<br>
This structure allows the peptide to be released in three stages, which are,<br>
respectively: pure diffusion, diffusion with swelling of the PLGA and release<br>
caused by PLGA degradation.<br>
This allows the total release time to be significantly increased.<br>
When these Implants are introduced into an aqueous environment the water<br>
diffuses through the polymer matrix, reaches the peptide particles closest to the<br>
surface and then the more intemal zones, resulting in the formation of a porous<br>
lattice of the hydrated peptide, through which  the phenomenon of peptide release via pure diffusion (first stage) occurs.<br>
The implant remains unchanged for approximately 6 weeks and over this period<br>
releases approximately 30% of the peptide.<br>
The duration of this pure diffusion stage is essentially determined by the degree of<br>
heterogeneity of the dimensions of the peptide particles and the speed is<br>
essentially determined by the peptide content in the PLGA matrix.<br>
As a result of the wide diversity in the dimensions of the peptide granules, a<br>
sufficient quantity of peptide remains after the first stage of dissolution to be<br>
released over the subsequent stages.<br>
In the second stage the peptide is released by diffusion with 3V,-c!lir.g of the<br>
polymer,<br>
in the third stage, the residual peptide is released when the matrix is destroyed.<br>
The succession of the three stages for releasing the peptide without dead time<br>
depends on the appropriate choice of constituents in the composition, in particular;<br>
•	the  heterogeneous   nature  of the  dimensions  of the  peprtide  particles determines the first stage of release;<br>
•	the characteristics of the PLGA (molecular weight and molar ratio) have an influence on the stages of the swelling and matrix degradation.<br>
The technical difficulty of this invention lies in retaining the heterogeneous natiJre of the dimensions of the peptide particles throughout the process for preparing the<br><br>
weights ranging from 50.000 to 150,000 and a molar ratio between the lactic acid<br>
and the glycolic monomer comprised t&gt;etween 50:50 and 95:5.<br>
Preferred potylactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) to be used in the process In accordance<br>
with this Invention has a high nominal molecular weight, of between 100,000 and<br>
150,000 D, and a motar ratio between lactic monomer and glycolic monomer of<br>
between 70/30 and 75/25.<br>
The peptides which can be used In this invention are preferably, but not<br>
exclusively, analogues of LHRIH and comprise, for example<br>
avoretine:	5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidiI-L-tryptophil-L-seryl-L-tyrosH-2-methyl-<br>
D-tryptophil-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-prolylamide;<br>
tryptoreline:      5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histldyl-Utryptophil-L-seryl-L-tyrosil-D-tryptophil-L-<br>
leucyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-glicinamide:<br>
leuproreline: 5-oxo-L-profil-L-histidyl-L-tryptophll-L-seryl-L-tyrosil-D-teucyl-L-leucyl-<br>
L-argin^-N-etll-L-prolylamide;<br>
gosereline:     -     5^)xo-L.prolyl-L-hlstldyl-L-tfyptophll-L-seryl-L-tyrosH-tert-butyl-ID-<br>
seryl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-L-prolyl-NH-NH-CaNHj.<br>
The peptide preferably used In this Invention is avorellne.<br>
The content of peptide in the composition Is between 20 and 40%, preferably<br>
between 20 and 36% by weight.<br>
The quantity of liquid added for granulation is between 10 and 60, preferably<br>
between 20 and 45 parts by weight In comparison with the mixture.<br>
The desiccation involved in stage c) takes place at- a temperaUire of between 20-<br>
50, preferably l&gt;etween 20-30**C in a current of dry air.<br>
The transversal section of the cylinders obtained from stage f) reveals under<br>
microscope a heterogeneous stmcture containing peptide particles having the<br>
same granulometry as the initial peptide immersed In the matrix constituted by the<br>
PLGA.<br>
The cylinders obtained from stage f) can be successfully used, for subcutaneous<br>
implants.<br>
Each implant having a diameter of between 1.0 and 1.7, preferably between 1.3<br>
and 1.5 mm. and a length of between 10 and 30, preferably between 15 and 24<br>
mm, has a peptide content of between 5 and 20 mg.<br><br>
for   subcutaneous use with diameter of 1.5 mm, length 18 mm and avoreline<br>
content of 25.3% by weight were obtained.<br>
The transversal section of these implants examined under microscope under x275<br>
enlargment reveals a heterogeneous distribution of the particles of avoreline In the<br>
mass of PLGA, as shown in Figure 1. In particular the particles of avoreline retain<br>
their initial granulometry of between 1 micrometi^ ad 60 microrrtetre.<br>
The same microscopic examination was carried out on an Implant produced using<br>
a known technique obtained in accordance with US 5.366.734 which under 1100x<br>
enlargement reveats a homogeneous drstribution of the two components as \rFigure 2.<br>
Kinetics of in vitro release<br>
The implants prepared in accordance with Example 1 were tested in vitro in order<br>
to examine the kinetics of releasing avoreline.<br>
The test was canried out under the following conditions.<br>
Five implants were Introduced into one flask and the 5 ml of phosphate buffer at<br>
pH 7.4 were added. The test was conducted at 37°C for a period of 210 days,<br>
continuousfy stirring the solution using 100 turns per minute.<br>
Each week the buffer solution containing the active constituent released over ttie<br>
same period was sampled and analysed, while 5ml of phosphate buffer were<br>
added to the flask as above.<br>
The content of avoreline in the solutions was determined by means of HPLC under<br>
the following conditions:<br>
Column;	Vydac 218TP 54300A medium, 5 ^m,<br>
dimensions 250 x 4.6 mm<br>
Mobile phase: 750 ml phosphoric acid 0.1 M were added to 250 ml of acetonitrlle and the pH was con-eded to 2.5 with trietiiylamine and the mixture filtered over an FH type filter (miliipore).<br>
Output:	1.5 ml/minute.<br>
Temperature:	SO'^C<br>
Determination:        UV at 220 nm<br>
Injection:	volume 10 nl<br>
