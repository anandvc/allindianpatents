				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of vicinal diols from aryl<br>
halide and olefin using reusable multifunctional catalyst. More particularly the present<br>
invention relates to a process for the preparation vicinal diols from aryl halide and olefin by<br>
asymmetric  dihydroxylation  of olefins  in  presence  of  cinchona   alkaloid  compounds<br>
employing reusable multifunctional catalysts as heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
Heterogeneous multifunctional catalyst used in the above process has been prepared by a<br>
process as claimed and disclosed in our co-pending application no.1199/Del/2001.<br>
The multifunctional catalyst has been prepared by a procedure as claimed and disclosed in<br>
our co-pending application no.1199/Del/2001.<br>
Products obtained by the dihydroxylation of olefins in presence of cinchona alkaloid<br>
compounds are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals.<br>
For example the products of cinnamic acid esters are intermediates for taxol side chain. An<br>
anticancer drug, diltiazem, calcium antagonist and chloramphenicol can also be derived<br>
from the diols obtained through this method.<br>
There are serious disadvantages in performing the catalytic AD reaction with homogeneous<br>
system in the manufactue of vicinal diols due to presence of toxic remnants of osmium in<br>
products and high cost of osmium tetroxide or potassium osmate dehydrate.<br>
US patent US 4,871,855 and 5,260,421 disclsoe homogeneous asymmetric dihydroxylation<br>
of olefins by osmium tetroxide and cinchona alkaloids. The inherent disadvantages in this<br>
process are cumbersome procedure for the recovery of the osmium catalyst from the<br>
reaction mixture, generation of toxic waste and possibility of presence of toxic osmium in<br>
traces in the product.<br>
US Patent US 5,516,929 discloses heterogeneous asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins by<br>
osmium tetroxide and polymer-bound cinchona alkaloids. The drawbacks of this process<br>
are   the   difficulty   faced   in   quantitative   recovery   of  toxic   osmium   catalyst,   lower<br>
enantioselectivity and reduction in activity and enantioselectivity in each and every recycle<br>
experiments.<br>
US patent US 5,968,867 discloses heterogeneous asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins by<br>
osmium tetroxide and silica gen supported bis-cinchona alkaloid derivatives. The<br>
drawbacks are difficulty in quantitative recovery of toxic osmium catalyst and reduction in activity and enantioselectivity in each and every recycle experiments.<br>
European patent EP 940,170 A2 discloses catalytic asymmetric dihydroxylation of alkenes using a polymer-supported osmium catalyst. The drawbacks are that higher amount of catalyst (5 mol%), longer reaction time and use of expensive polymer as a support are required.<br>
Reference may be made to a publication J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 1365 wherein asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins is done by osmium tetroxide and a biomimetic flavin in presence of cinchona alkaloids using H2O2 as oxidant under homogeneous conditions. The inherent disadvantages are difficulty in the recovery of osmium tetroxide and usage of unstable flavin.<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide reusable multifunctional catalysts useful for the synthesis of chiral vicinal diols.<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare reusable multifunctional catalysts having transition metal elements such as palladium, osmium and tugsten deposited in a support having interstitial anions such as chloride, nitrate, carbonate, sulfate or calcined material.<br>
Another object of the invention is to prepare reusable multifunctional catalysts on a single matrix of the support to perform multi-component reaction in a single pot.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a novel and ecofriendly process for synthesis of chiral diols from aryl halides and olefins in a single pot.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the synthesis of chiral diols dispensing with the use of soluble and toxic; osmium tetraoxide or potassium osmate dihydrate.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a multifunctional catalysts are prepared and used as heterogeneous catalysts for synthesis of chiral diols which precludes the presence of osmium in traces with product.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the synthesis of chiral vicinal diols where enantioselectivity and the yields are good and work-up procedure simple.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the synthesis of chiral vicinal diols which is economical and environmentally safe without any disposal problem.<br>
By employing the heterogeneous catalytic system, the cost naturally comes down due to easy recovery of the catalyst and very insignificant loss of osmium tetroxide, when compared with homogenous system. The products thus obtained using heterogeneous catalyst system are also benign since the presence of osmium in minor impurities in the dihydroxylated products is also precluded.<br>
The present invention provides multifunctional catalysts consisting of palladium, osmium and tungsten species in their composition in its homogeneous or heterogeneous form through ion exchange or anchoring for the preparation of vicinal diols which are important intermediates for drugs and Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of vicinal diol from aryl halide and olefin using a reusable multifunctional catalyst having formula S-M, wherein S is a support selected from the group consisting of layered double hydroxide, resin, silica, clay, alumina and S'-NR3X wherein S' is a unmodified support selected from resin and silica, R is an alkyl group selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl, X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, I, F, OH and OAc; M is an active metal species comprising two different transition metals essentially one is palladium and another one is selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, osmium, tungsten, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper and molybdenum, said process comprising reacting aryl halide and olefin using the said catalyst by Heck coupling and asymmetric dihydroxylation in the presence of an oxidant and a cinchona alkaloid compound in a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, acetone, acetonitrile and t-butanol, at a temperature in the range of -20 to 200Â°C for a period ranging from 0.5 to 48 hours and obtaining the desired chiral vicinal diol. In one embodiment of the invention, the quantity of multifunctional catalyst used in the reaction is in the range of 0.01 to 10 mol% of active species with respect to the substrate. In one embodiment of the invention, the multifunctional catalyst used is recovered by filtration and is reused for several cycles with consistent activity.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the oxidant used is selected from the group consisting of N-methyl morpholine N-oxide (NMO), trimethylamine N-oxide, hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydrogen peroxide, potassium ferricyanide, sodium periodate and molecular oxygen. In one embodiment of the invention, the cinchona alkaloid compound used is selected from the group consisting of dihydroquinidine 1,2 dichlorophthalazine, dihydroquinidine pyridine diethyl ether, dihydroquinidine anthraquinone, dihydroquinidine 0-acetate, dihydroquinidin chlorobenzylpyrimidine dihtydroquinidine phenanthyrl, dihydroquinidine 9-0-(4'-methyl-2'-quinidyl) and other pseudoenantiomeric forms of such ligands.<br>
DHQD-CLB, DHQD-PHN, DHQD-MEQ, DHQD-IND and other pseudoenantiomeric forms of such ligands.<br>
The novelty in the invention lies in the preparation of multifunctional catalysts through simple exchange process for the first time and use thereof in catalytic amounts for preparing vicinal diols by tandem and/or simultaneous reactions involving Heck coupling, N-oxidation and asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins employing oxidants in presence of cinchona alkaloid compounds. Higher yields and enantioselectivities are obtained when multifunctional catalysts are used in the synthesis of diols. Since the dihydroxylated products are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals, this invention that envisages reduction of toxic osmium metal content in these products is timely and appropriate. The consistent activity and enantioselectivity obtained for several cycles in multicomponent reaction makes the process economical and possible for commercial realization. Therefore, multifunctional catalysts are better option for the synthesis of vicinal diols. The use of different supports and varied compositions used in the preparation of multifunctional catalysts has no impact on its final form of catalysts with respect to activity and enantioselectivity. Thus this invention offers the best techno-economic route for the synthesis of chiral vicinal diols, intermediates for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals.<br>
In the present invention, multifunctional catalysts have been synthesized for the first time and used in catalytic amounts for preparing vicinal diols by tandem and/or simultaneous reactions involving Heck coupling, N-oxidation and asymmetric dihydroxylation of olefins employing oxidants in presence of cinchona alkaloid compounds in a heterogeneous manner. Multifunctional catalysts are prepared by anion exchange of active species or anchoring through covalent bond formation on various supports originated from inorganic or organic. The metals immobilized on supports are responsible for the multifunctional activity of catalyst. The activity of heterogeneous multifunctional catalysts is similar or higher than the homogeneous counter parts. The higher activity is ascribed to the support effect. Higher yields and enantioselectivities are obtained with multifunctional catalysts used in the multicomponent reaction in aqueous organic solvents. Since the dihydroxylated products are important intermediateis for the preparation of drugs and Pharmaceuticals, this invention is timely and appropriate. Therefore, multifunctional catalysts are a better option for the<br>
synthesis of vicinal diols. The multifunctional catalysts prepared irrespective of support or method of immobilization used in the preparation of multifunctional catalysts offered good yields and enantioselectivies in presence of cinchona alkaloids.<br>
Multifunctional catalysts are prepared and used in catalytic amounts for preparing vicinal diols  by  muticomponent  reaction   using   oxidants   in   presence   of  cinchona   alkaloid compounds in a heterogeneous manner are described in the following examples, which are by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.

reusable multifunctional catalysts. The catalyst of the invention is important since it can<br>
catalyse three different reactions by generating the precursors, pro chiral olefins and<br>
NMO for AD reaction in situ from the readily available cheaper starting materials such as<br>
styrenes and aryl halides thereby saving energy and time vital for a better and economical<br>
process. The catalysts used are economical and do not present a problem of disposal.<br>
