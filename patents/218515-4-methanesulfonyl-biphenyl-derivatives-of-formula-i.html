4'-METHANESULF0NYL-BIPHENYL DERIVATIVES AS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 INHIBITOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to 4' -methanesulfonyl-biphenyl derivatives as a highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Most of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs represent actions such as anti-inflammation, analgesic, and antipyretic activity by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase or prostaglandin G/H synthase. In addition, they can suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. First, only cyclooxygenase-1 was known to be found in cow as a constitutional enzyme. But recently, cyclooxygenase-2 is elucidated as an induced form. Cyclooxygenase-2 is identified to be discriminated clearly from cyclooxygenase-1 and can be provoked easily by mitogen, endotoxin, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like.<br>
Prostaglandins  have  various  pathological  and physiological functions. Precisely, cyclooxygenase-1 as<br><br>
a constitutional enzyme participates in the secretion of basic endogenous prostaglandin and plays an important role in physiological aspects such as stomach homeostasis, renal blood circulation and so on. On the other hand, cyclooxygenase-2 is induced by inflammatory factors, hormones, growth factors, cytokines and the like and thus plays an important role in pathological effects of prostaglandins. Therefore, selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 are expected to have no side effect on account of the functional mechanism compared with the anti-inflammatory drugs such as conventional non-steroid agents and to represent actions such as anti-inflammation, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. Furthermore, it is estimated to suppress the uterine contraction induced by hormones and the cell proliferation in several kinds of cancers. Especially, it probably has less side effects such as gastrointestinal toxicity, renal toxicity and the like. Also, it is assumed to prevent the synthesis of contractive prostanoids and thus inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle induced by the prostanoid. Hence, it can be applied usefully to treat a premature birth, dysmenorrhea, asthma and several diseases associated with eosinophilic leukocytes. Besides, it can be exploited widely to cure osteoporosis, glaucoma and athymia, which has been disclosed in a lot of references,  especially the usefulness  of  selective<br><br>
inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 (References: John Vane, " Towards a better aspirin " in Nature, Vol, 367, pp 215-216, 1994; Bruno Battistini, Regina Botting and Y. S. Bakhle, w COX-1 and COX-2; Toward the Development of More Selective NSAIDs " in Drug News and Perspectives, Vol. 7, pp 501-512, 1994; David B. Reitz and Karen Seibert, vx Selective Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors " in Annual .Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, James A. Bristol, Editor, Vol. 30, pp 179-188, 1995).<br>
The selective inhibitors against cyclooxygenase-2 have been reported to have various structural forms. Among these, the diaryl heterocycle structure, namely a tricyclic system, has been studied most frequently and exploited to construct a lot of candidate substances. In this structure, it is essential that sulfonamide or methanesulfone group exist onto one phenyl group. The initial substance of such a structure is identified to be Dup697 (Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 5, No. 18, p 2123, 1995). Then, as a derivative, S058635 (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 40, p 1347,  1997) having a pyrrazole structure, MK-966 (WO 95/00501) having a furanone structure and the like are disclosed.<br><br>

the present invention can be prepared by performing the procedures as illustrated below.<br>
Howeverr the process for preparing the compounds of the present invention will not be restricted to following descriptions, especially in reaction solvents, bases, amounts of used reactants and the like.<br>
Moreover, the compound of the present invention also can be prepared by exploiting and combining various synthetic methods described in the present specification or disclosed in other references of those skilled in this arts with a coordinate and arbitrary mode.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conceptions and specific embodiments disclosed in the foregoing description may be readily utilized as a basis for modifying or designing other embodiments.<br>
Concretely,  the compound of  formula  1 in the present  invention  can  be  prepared  by  exploiting cathechol  as  an  initial  material  as  illustrated schematically in following reaction formula 1 and 2. <reaction formula><br><br><br><br>
Wherein, R signifies R1 and R2, Formula (la) represents that R1 and R2 are identical in the compound of formula 1.<br>
In the process for the preparation of the present invention, it is most important to prepare a biphenyl intermediate through the Suzuki reaction after adopting a selective protecting group to cathechol, an initial substance.<br>
In  the  process  for  adopting  a  selective protecting group to cathechol, an initial substance, the reaction solvent can be an organic solvent commonly used    such    as    dichloromethane,    chloroform, tetrahydrofurane, dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, diethylether and the like and dimethylformamide is the most  preferable  among  these.  Tetrahydrofurane  and diethylether are recommended to exploit with purifying. Resulting intermediate compound should be selectively brominated  at  the  range  of  0     -80 Â°C  and  more preferably, at a low temperature in between -7 5 ~ -80"C. Catalyst which is used in Suzuki  reaction to form biphenyl   derivatives   can   be   selected   among palladiumacetate,  tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium, and   bistriphenylphosphinepalladium   chloride   and tetrakistriphenylphosphinepalladium is most preferable. The reaction should be progressed under the presence of inorganic salt group such as sodiumacetate,  sodium hydroxide,  potassium  hydroxide,  sodium  carbonate,<br><br>
potassium carbonate and the like and potassium carbonate is most preferable among these. Additionally, benzene, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, dimethylformamide and the like are utilized as a solvent and benzene and toluene are most preferable. Oxidizing agent which is utilized in a process of oxidizing sulfanyl group included in biphenyl intermediate into sulfonyl group is mainly selected from OXONE, hydrogen peroxide, magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, metachloroperoxybenzoic acid and the like. There is no problem to exploit anything among these, but magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate is most preferable.<br>
In reaction formula 1, R1 group is adopted to 4-1ocation of biphenyl first, and then pivaloyl group to 3-location as a protecting group. In this case, pivaloyl group is seceded in the process of hydrolyzing methanesulfonyl group which has been formed onto 4'-1ocation of biphenyl and then, R2 group is adopted to 3-location of biphenyl. As a result, the compound of formula 1 where R1 and R2 are mutually different is obtained.<br>
In reaction formula 2, t-butyldimethylsilyl group is adopted to 4-location of biphenyl as a protecting group and pivaloyl group to 3-location as a protecting group. In this case, both t-butyldimethylsilyl group and pivaloyl group are seceded in the process of hydrolyzing methanesulfonyl group<br><br>
which has been formed onto 4'-location of biphenyl and then, diol compound is formed. By reacting diol compound with Rx compound, a compound where R1 and R2 are identical is obtained.<br>
After completing the reaction, the resulting products can be processed through a common treatment such as chromatography, re-crytallization and the like so as to be separated and purified.<br>
The compound of the present invention depicted in formula 1 has an activity for the selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 and thus can be utilized as an enzymatic inhibitor. The compound of formula 1 as a selective inhibitor against cyclooxygenase-2 can be a substitute for conventional non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs. Concretely, it improves side effects of anti-inflammatory drugs in existed nonsteroids and is useful in patients suffering from peptic ulcer, gastritis, partial enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal haemorrhagia, hypoprothrombinemia and the like. Besides, it is expected to treat inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis â¢ and the like effectively.<br>
The compound of the present invention can be administered in a single dose or in separated doses, depending upon clinical purposes. The specific dosage for patients will vary, depending upon factors such as<br><br>
a sort of drug compound, body weight, sex, physical condition, diet, administration period, administration method, discharge ratio, drug composition and severity of diseases and the like.<br>
The compound of the present invention can be administered as an oral, a local, a parenteral (subcutaneous, venous and muscular syringe or injection), an inhalational or a rectal drug. In case that these are prepared to a pharmaceutical drug, one or more commonly used vehicles, methods for the preparation and the like can be adopted properly from prior arts widely reported to those skilled.<br>
In order to attain the desired purpose of clinical administration, the active compound of formula 1 in the present invention can be administered coincidently by combining more than one component of other commercial drugs.<br>
However, the pharmaceutical drugs containing the compound of the present invention is not limited to forms described above, if it has a purpose for inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 selectively. All kinds of drugs useful for the enzymatic inhibition can be within the scope of the present invention.<br>

Experimental  Example&gt;  The  activity  of  selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2<br>
(1)   Experimental procedure<br>
In order to investigate the activity of the<br><br>
present compound for the selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pharmacologically, the enzymatic activities inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were measured quantitatively-First of all, the cyclooxygenase-1 was examined through the following procedure.<br>
Peritoneal fluid in which macrophages were suspended was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4Â°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended using 20ml of incomplete RPMI medium [including PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin) ] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the reactant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete RPMI 164 0 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach 1 X 106 eel Is /ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. The resulting suspension was poured into each well of 96-well plate and left with the incubator at 37Â°C in 5% CO2 for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-RPMI 1640 medium so as to adjust the total volume reaching 200 p.1. The resulting cell was cultivated with the incubator at 37Â°C in 5% C02 for<br><br>
about 12 - 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 |iM of a final concentration and incubated at 37Â°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (- 180 |il) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the ELISA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-1.<br>
Second, the cyclooxygenase-2 was examined through the following procedure.<br>
Peritoneal fluid in which macrophages were suspended was extracted from a mouse peritoneal cavity and centrifuged at 4Â°C, 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Then, the supernatant was removed, suspended using 20ml of incomplete RPMI medium [PC/SM (penicilin/streptomycin)] and again centrifuged under the same condition. In addition, the reactant was washed twice and then the cell pellet was suspended with 10 ml of incomplete (without serum) RPMI 1640 medium so as to prepare a cell suspension. Then, the cell number was calculated with the hemocytometer and adjusted to reach 1 X 106 cells/ml of cell concentration in the final cell suspension. The resulting suspension was treated with aspirin, adjusting 500 \iM of final concentration and poured into each well of 96-well plate in 100 (4.1<br><br>
respectively. Again, it was left with the incubator at 37Â°C in 5% C02 for about 2 hours in order to attach macrophages. The attached macrophage was washed twice by using PBS buffer, treated to experimental samples in a proper concentration and then blended with 3% FBS-RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 fig/ml of LPS in each well. The resulting cell was cultivated with the incubator at 37Â°C in 5% C02 for about 12 ~ 16 hours. Then, arachidonic acid was added, adjusting to 10 |iM of a final concentration and incubated at 37Â°C for more 10 minutes and the supernatant of the reacted solution (-18 0 jil) was recovered to finish the reaction. In order to quantitate the amount of PGE2 in the samples, the ELISA method recommended from Cayman Chemical company was exploited and the obtained results was used to estimate the inhibition ratio (%) of each compound against cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
(2) Experimental results<br>
The experimental results were demonstrated in Table 1 as follows.<br><table>
<br>
Inhibitory effects of cyclooxygenase (COX) (unit: % inhibition)<br><br><br>
