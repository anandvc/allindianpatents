OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, as stated in the heading to this<br>
descriptive specification, relates to a process and a<br>
device that allow to compensate the low frequency-<br>
magnetic field which is produced in an inductive coupling<br>
unit.<br>
The invention is preferably applicable for injecting high<br>
frequency signals on the electricity grid by means of an<br>
inductive coupling unit, and its object is to minimize<br>
the insertion loss of a high frequency signal on the<br>
electricity grid, to which end it avoids the effect of<br>
magnetic saturation which occurs in the inductive<br>
coupling unit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In telecommunications systems, once the signal has been<br>
produced in the transmitter it is necessary to inject it<br>
into the transmission medium, in order that it reachs the<br>
receiver.<br>
The way of carrying out the injection depends mainly on<br>
the transmission medium employed.<br>
In the case of injecting signals onto the electricity<br>
grid, this can be carried out with inductive coupling<br>
units which are usually constituted by current<br>
transformers which are placed around the power conductors<br>
in which it is desired to induce the signal. In these<br>
cases the operation is based on the principle that<br>
currents which vary in time generate magnetic fields<br>
which vary in time and viceversa. In other words, the<br>
radiofrequency (RF) current it is desired to inject,<br>
produces a variable magnetic field (in time, and<br><br>
therefore a magnetic flux also variable in time) inside<br>
the ferromagnetic core of the coupling unit and, besides,<br>
the variation of magnetic flux around a conductor,<br>
induces therein a current proportional to this variation.<br>
Based on this principle, it is possible to induce signals<br>
between conductors enclosed by the same magnetic core.<br>
Because there are high electric currents circulating<br>
through the power conductors, and therefore, the magnetic<br>
field strength around the cables is very high, the<br>
problem arises that if a ferromagnetic core is placed<br>
around the cables, the magnetic core can become saturated<br>
and unusable for carrying out the function of signal<br>
injection.<br>
In the state of the art it is known that this effect can<br>
be overcome by including an air gap in the magnetic<br>
circuit so that the reluctance of the magnetic circuit is<br>
considerably increased and the magnetic flux is decreased<br>
dramatically. This implies an increase in the insertion<br>
loss of the signal, which is not desirable in<br>
communication applications, wherein the loss signifies an<br>
effective reduction in the range of the communications<br>
system.<br>
To counteract this effect the usual practice is to<br>
lengthen the coupling unit in order to try to cover more<br>
flux, but this makes the coupling unit more bulky and<br>
more expensive, which is not desirable; ,and all this<br>
while seeking a compromise solution between size, air<br>
gap, and insertion loss.<br>
The present invention allows the inductive coupling to be<br>
carried out without saturation of the ferromagnetic core<br>
taking place and without additional insertion loss<br>
occurring.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To avoid the drawbacks indicated in the foregoing<br><br>
paragraphs, the invention comprises a process for<br>
compensating the low frequency magnetic field in an<br>
inductive signal coupling unit, wherein the coupling unit<br>
comprises a magnetic core which surrounds a conductor<br>
through which a low frequency current is circulating in<br>
order to inject a high frequency signal therein.<br>
The process of the invention is characterised in that it<br>
foresees a selective detection of the current which is<br>
circulating through the conductor or of the magnetic<br>
field produced in the coupling unit, in order to obtain<br>
thereafter a compensating current based on the value<br>
obtained in the detection performed, said injection<br>
current being produced with an external source, by the<br>
actual equipment which wishes to transmit the high<br>
frequency signal over the grid or automatically by<br>
induction on a winding around the coupler. Subsequently<br>
the injection of the compensating current obtained in the<br>
coupling unit is produced through a low pass filter which<br>
offers a high impedance to the high frequency signal it<br>
is desired to inject.<br>
The action of injecting the compensating current results<br>
in that, in the inductive coupling unit, a magnetic field<br>
is produced equal and opposite to that produced by the<br>
current which is circulating through the conductor,<br>
whereby saturation is avoided in the magnetic core of the<br>
inductive coupling unit without adding insertion loss for<br>
the desired signal it is to transmit, and maximum<br>
efficiency is obtained.<br>
The invention has been specially conceived to send high<br>
frequency signals over the electricity grid in which a<br>
low frequency current is circulating.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the detection of the<br>
magnetic field is carried out in the ferromagnetic core<br>
of the inductive signal coupling unit. The magnetic field<br><br>
detected is compared with a reference signal in order to<br>
obtain the compensating current, so that the signal of<br>
the measure of the magnetic field is maintained<br>
practically equal to the reference signal, wherein said<br>
reference signal lies between 0 and a value such that the<br>
coupling unit is prevented from becoming saturated, that<br>
is, the signal inside the ferromagnetic core of the<br>
coupling unit never surpasses the maximum flux density it<br>
is capable of withstanding.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the detection is<br>
achieved by measuring the current which is circulating in<br>
the electricity grid.<br>
The injection of the compensating current obtained, is<br>
carried out by means of a compensation winding which is<br>
applied on the ferromagnetic core of the inductive signal<br>
coupling unit through a low pass filter which offers a<br>
high impedance for the high frequency signals it is<br>
desired to inject.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the measurement of the<br>
current which is circulating through the conductor is<br>
carried out by means of a winding arranged on a<br>
ferromagnetic core which is independent of the inductive<br>
signal coupling unit.<br>
The invention also foresees that the detection, the<br>
obtaining of the compensating current, and the injection<br>
of said current are carried out simultaneously by<br>
locating a winding with a single winding around a double<br>
core which forms the ferromagnetic core of the coupling<br>
unit.<br>
The invention also refers to a low frequency magnetic<br>
field compensating device in an inductive signal coupling<br>
unit which works according to the aforementioned process.<br>
To this end the device of the invention comprises a<br>
detector which is selectively constituted by a current<br><br>
detector which is circulating through the conductor or by<br>
a detector of the magnetic field produced in the coupling<br>
unit.<br>
Moreover the device of the invention comprises a control<br>
module by means of which a compensating current is<br>
calculated and produced, based on the value obtained in<br>
the detector.<br>
The current produced by the control module is injected in<br>
the conductor by means of a compensation winding arranged<br>
on the ferromagnetic core of the coupling unit, and<br>
through a filter offering high impedance to high<br>
frequencies which prevents the high frequency signal to<br>
be injected from being affected by the injection of the<br>
compensating current.<br>
The injection of the compensating current produces a<br>
magnetic field in the ferromagnetic core, equal and<br>
opposite to that produced by the current which is<br>
circulating through the conductor, so that saturation is<br>
avoided of the magnetic core of the inductive coupling<br>
unit, whereby insertion loss is not added and the maximum<br>
efficiency is obtained in the transmission of the signals<br>
over the electricity grid.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the detector is<br>
constituted by means of a device for measuring the<br>
magnetic field inside the ferromagnetic core of the<br>
coupling unit. The signal provided by the detector is<br>
compared with a reference signal, which preferably is<br>
zero, and is applied to the control module so that the<br>
latter generates the compensating current to obtain a<br>
signal from the detector equal to the reference signal.<br>
The injection of the current produced by the control<br>
module is carried out through a low pass filter and by<br>
means of a compensation winding which is arranged around<br>
the ferromagnetic core of the inductive signal coupling<br><br><br>
unit.<br>
The device of the invention also foresees that it comprises a single winding around a<br>
double core which constitutes the ferromagnetic core of the coupling unit in order to<br>
carry out simultaneously the detection, the obtaining of the compensating current and the<br>
injection of said current.<br>
Next, to assist in a better understanding of this descriptive specification and being an<br>
integral part thereof, some figures are appended wherein by way of illustration and not<br>

DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A description is made below of several embodiments of the<br>
invention, making reference to the numbering adopted in<br>
the figures.<br>
The embodiments of the invention refer to the injection<br>
of a specific signal onto a conductor of the electricity<br>
grid, over which a low frequency current 1 is<br>
circulating, and onto which conductor a high frequency<br>
signal is desired to be injected.<br>
Based on figure 1 a generic description is provided of<br>
the problem presented in the state of the art. The employ<br>
of inductive couplers is known for injecting a determined<br>
signal onto a conductor through which a current 1 is<br>
circulating. To this end the inductive coupler is<br>
constituted by a ferromagnetic core 3 0 arranged around<br>
the conductor onto which one desires to inject the<br>
signal, and in which is included a winding 31 to which a<br>
current 2 is applied that produces a magnetic field 4 in<br>
the ferromagnetic core 30, which induces a current in the<br>
conductor. This device has the drawback that the current<br>
1 which is circulating through the conductor also<br>
produces a magnetic field 3 in the ferromagnetic core 30,<br>
so that if said magnetic field 3 is high, saturation of<br>
the ferromagnetic core 30 occurs, whereby the current 2<br>
is unable to increase the value of the magnetic field and<br>
hence no current is induced in the conductor, and<br>
therefore the desired signal is not injected.<br>
To overcome this drawback, an embodiment is shown in<br>
figure 2 wherein a Hall-effect sensor 5 is mounted on the<br>
ferromagnetic core 30, which sensor requires an external<br>
power supply in order to be able to work (not shown in<br>
the figure). In this case the current 1 which is<br>
circulating through the conductor likewise produces a<br><br>
magnetic field 3 in the ferromagnetic core 30, which is<br>
detected by the sensor 5, the signal obtained being<br>
applied to a low pass filter 6 which smoothes the<br>
obtained signal.<br>
The detected and filtered signal has been referred to<br>
with the number 20, which signal is applied to a<br>
comparator 32 which in turn receives a reference signal<br>
21, and which moreover is connected to a control module<br>
7, which calculates and generates a compensating current<br>
to maintain the signal 2 0 equal to the value of the<br>
reference signal 21. The compensating current is applied<br>
through a power stage 8 and a radiofrequency choke 9 to a<br>
winding 33 arranged on the ferromagnetic core 30,<br>
producing in the latter a magnetic field 4 equal and<br>
opposite to the field 3 produced by the current 1, so<br>
that a compensation of the magnetic field 3 occurs, so<br>
that the ferromagnetic core 3 0 is not saturated, whereby<br>
the current 2 is induced in the conductor without<br>
additional insertion loss.<br>
By means of the radiofrequency chokes 9 low pass filters<br>
are obtained which impede the passage of the high<br>
frequencies produced by the signal to be injected.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, as shown in<br>
figure 3, the current 1 which circulates through the<br>
conductor is obtained by means of an external<br>
ferromagnetic core 11 on which a coil 34 has been<br>
arranged wherein, from the magnetic field produce by<br>
current 1 in the ferromagnetic core 11, said current 1<br>
is produced in the coil 34, this current 1 being applied,<br>
through the radiofrequency choke 9 to the winding 33, the<br>
compensation of the magnetic field being produced in the<br>
manner described for the example in the previous figure.<br>
Lastly in figures 4 and 5 other examples are shown for<br>
compensation of the magnetic field 3 produced by current<br><br>
1. Thus, in the example of figure 4 the employ is<br>
foreseen of two inductive couplers constituted by a<br>
double ferromagnetic core 16 and 17 that form the<br>
ferromagnetic core 30. The ferromagnetic core 16 is a<br>
power transformer, not suitable for radiofrequency, that<br>
is, it has a very high magnetic permeability at low<br>
frequencies and very low at high frequencies; whilst the<br>
ferromagnetic core 17 is suitable for radiofrequency;<br>
that is, it has a very low magnetic permeability at low<br>
frequency and very high at high frequency.<br>
In this case the detection and obtaining of the<br>
compensating current is carried out simultaneously by<br>
locating a winding around the double ring of the coupler.<br>
The magnetic induction, produced by the current which is<br>
passing through the cable, is detected by the winding and<br>
produces therein the current which later serves to<br>
perform the compensation. To this end, n coils are<br>
mounted which act as radiofrequency chokes 18 and which<br>
enclose both ferromagnetic cores 16 and 17, a smaller<br>
nominal current being achieved in each winding 19, so<br>
that said current carries out the desired compensation of<br>
the magnetic field induced by the current 1 which is<br>
circulating through the conductor. In this way the<br>
magnetic field 3 is only induced in the ferromagnetic<br>
core 16 and the magnetic field 4 in the ferromagnetic<br>
core 17 preventing the aforesaid saturation from taking<br>
place.<br>
In figure 5 an alternative embodiment is shown in which n<br>
windings are mounted short-circuited by means of a<br>
radiofrequency choke 15. This case is equivalent to the<br>
previous one, but it has the advantage of reducing the<br>
number of choke coils necessary to carry out the<br>
compensation.<br>
In figure 6 another alternative embodiment is shown of a<br><br>
device which implements the process of the invention. In<br>
this device a single winding 35 is used around the double<br>
ferromagnetic core 16 and 17 that forms the ferromagnetic<br>
core 30 of the coupling unit. This case is similar to<br>
that presented in figure 5, but with the advantage of<br>
reducing the number of windings and without having to use<br>
choke coils for the compensation. By means of said<br>
winding 3 5 the detection and obtaining of the<br>
compensating current are carried out simultaneously.<br>
Moreover, and because the winding has a high impedance at<br>
low frequencies and has a low impedance at high<br>
frequencies, the injection of the compensating current is<br>
carried out simultaneously by mounting said winding 35,<br>
whereby a low cost solution is obtained.<br><br>
