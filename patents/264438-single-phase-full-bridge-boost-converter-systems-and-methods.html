				<td>SINGLE-PHASE FULL BRIDE BOOST CONVERTER SYSTEMS AND<br>
METHODS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to AC-to-DC power<br>
converters, and more particularly relates to single-phase full bridge boost<br>
converters and methods for charging a load coupled to a single-phase AC<br>
voltage source.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In the vector control approach for multi-phase converters, variables<br>
that vary with time (e.g., AC voltage and AC current) are transferred to the<br>
synchronous rotating direct-quatrature (D-Q) reference frame to enable the<br>
converter system to work with constant values instead of time varying values.<br>
D-Q transformations have been defined for multi-phase converter systems<br>
(e.g., two-phase and three-phase systems), but have not been defined for a<br>
single-phase system.<br>
[0003] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide single-phase full bridge boost<br>
converter systems. It is also desirable to provide methods for charging a load<br>
coupled to a single-phase AC voltage source. Furthermore, other desirable<br>
features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from<br>
the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims,<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background of<br>
the invention.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] Systems are provided for issuing a switching to a single-phase full<br>
boost converter comprising a voltage sensor for detecting voltage in the DC<br>
side of the single-phase full bridge boost converter, a current sensor for<br><br>
detecting alternating current in the AC side of the single-phase full bridge<br>
boost converter, and a plurality of switches configured to control the<br>
alternating current. One exemplary system comprises a direct-quatrature (D-<br>
Q) control system configured to be coupled to the voltage sensor and the<br>
current sensor, and further configured to generate a control voltage (vcon)<br>
comprising a direct-phase voltage component and a quadrature-phase voltage<br>
component. The system also comprises a comparator coupled to the D-Q<br>
control system and configured to be coupled to the switch and to a waveform<br>
reference voltage (vtri) source. In this embodiment, the comparator further<br>
configured to compare vcon to vtri, generate the switching command based on<br>
the comparison of vcon and vtri, and transmit the switching command to the<br>
switch.<br>
[0005] Systems for charging a load are also provided. An exemplary system<br>
comprises a single-phase full bridge boost converter comprising a plurality of<br>
switches coupled to a load and an AC voltage source. The switches are<br>
configured to provide charging current to the load in response to receiving<br>
switching commands. The system also comprises a direct-quadrature (D-Q)<br>
control system coupled to the single-phase full bridge boost converter,<br>
wherein the D-Q control system is configured to receive a first AC current (ia)<br>
value from the single-phase full bridge boost converter; delay the ia value to<br>
generate a second AC current (ib) value; and issue the switching commands<br>
based on the ia and ib values.<br>
[0006] Methods for charging a load in a single-phase full bridge boost<br>
converter comprising a plurality of switches coupled to the load, alternating<br>
current (ia), and a voltage (v) are also provided. One exemplary method<br>
comprises the steps of performing a direct-quadrature conversion to the ia to<br>
generate a direct current including a direct-phase current (id) component and a<br>
quadrature-phase current (iq) component, and issuing a switching command to<br>
the switch based on the id component and the iq component.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] The following detailed description of the invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the<br>
application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be<br>
bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention<br>
or the following detailed description of the invention.<br>
[0016] FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a prior art single-phase full bridge<br>
boost converter (hereinafter "converter") 100 connected to an AC voltage<br>
source 110. Converter 100 includes a node 122 connected to the negative<br><br>
terminal of AC voltage source 110 and an inductor 115 connected to the<br>
positive terminal of AC voltage source 110 and to a node 124.<br>
[0017] Converter 100 also includes diodes 140, 145, 150, and 155. Diode<br>
140 includes an anode connected to node 124 and a cathode connected to a<br>
node 126. Diode 145 includes a cathode connected to node 126 and an anode<br>
connected to a node 128, which is also connected to node 122. Diode 150<br>
includes a cathode connected to node 128 and an anode connected to a node<br>
130, which is also connected to a node 132 and to ground. Diode 155 includes<br>
a cathode connected to a node 136 connected to node 124, and an anode<br>
connected to node 132, which is connected to a node 134.<br>
[0018] Also included in converter 100 are switches (e.g., semiconductor<br>
switches) 160 and 165. Switch 160 is coupled to nodes 134 and 136, which is<br>
antiparallel with diode 155. Likewise, switch 165 is coupled to nodes 122 and<br>
130, which is antiparallel with diode 150.<br>
[0019] Converter 100 further includes a capacitor 170 coupled in parallel<br>
with a load (e.g., a battery) 175. Specifically, the negative terminal of both<br>
capacitor 170 and load 175 are connected to a node 139 that is also connected<br>
to node 134. The positive terminal of both capacitor 170 and load 175 are<br>
connected to a node 138 that is also connected to node 126.<br>
[0020] During operation, converter 100 uses four modes of operation to<br>
charge load 175. That is, converter 100 provides current to load 175 from AC<br>
voltage source 110 or from capacitor 170 depending on the mode of operation.<br>
Specifically, mode 1 occurs when the AC voltage from AC voltage source 110<br>
is positive and switches 160, 165 are both OFF. When operating in mode 1,<br>
current flows through inductor 115, diode 140, capacitor 170, load 175, and<br>
returns back through diode 150.<br>
[0021] Mode 2 occurs when the AC voltage is positive and switches 160,<br>
165 are both ON. When operating in mode 2, current flows through switch<br>
160 and back through diode 150. At the same time, capacitor 170 discharges<br>
and supplies current to load 175.<br><br>
[0022] Mode 3 occurs when the input AC voltage is negative and switches<br>
160, 165 are both OFF. When operating in mode 3, current flows through<br>
diode 145, capacitor 170, load 175, and back through diode 155 and inductor<br>
115.<br>
[0023] Mode 4 occurs when the input AC voltage is negative and switches<br>
160, 165 are both ON. When operating in mode 4, current flows through<br>
switch 165 and back through diode 155 and inductor 115. At the same time,<br>
capacitor 170 discharges and supplies current to load 175.<br>
[0024] FIG. 2 is a diagram of a prior art two-phase full bridge boost<br>
converter (hereinafter "converter") 200 connected to a D-Q control system<br>
(hereinafter "system") 300. Converter 200 includes an A-phase and a B-phase<br>
that are each similar to converter 100 discussed above with reference to FIG.<br>
1.<br>
[0025] System 300 is configured to issue switching commands to the<br>
plurality of switches in converter 200. That is, system 300 is based on<br>
transforming a two-phase balance system from a time-varying frame to a<br>
synchronous frame.<br>
[0026] As illustrated in FIG. 2, system 300 includes a phase-locked loop<br>
(PLL) 103 coupled to a sine function 105 and a cosine function 107. PLL 103<br>
may be any hardware and/or device capable of maintaining a phase angle (θ).<br>
Sine function 105 is configured to determine the sine function value of θ (i.e.,<br>
the sin θ value), and cosine function 107 is configured to determine the cosine<br>
function value of θ (i.e., the cos θ value).<br>

171 and 180. Specifically, comparator 112 is coupled to controller 143 and to<br>
a voltage sensor 293 configured to detect a DC voltage (vdc) in converter 200,<br>
and to a DC reference voltage source (not shown) that is configured to supply<br>
a constant (or substantially constant) DC reference voltage (Vdc-ref).<br>
Comparator 112 is configured to compare the difference between vdc and vdc-ref<br><br>
to determine a voltage error in converter 200 and transmit the determined<br>

[0028] Controller 143 may be any hardware and/or device (e.g., a PI<br>
controller) capable of generating a signal representing a reference quadrature-<br>
phase current (iq-ref) value from the determined voltage error. In one<br>
embodiment, controller 143 is configured to receive the voltage error from<br>
comparator 112 and determine an iq-ref value that, if applied to converter 200,<br>

value to generate the iasin 9 value that is supplied to subtractor 180.<br>

295 that detects AC current (ib) in the b-phase of converter 200. Multiplier<br>
123 is configured to receive a cos θ value from cosine function 107 and an ib<br>
value from current sensor 295, and multiply the cos θ value and the ib value to<br>
generate the ibcos θ value that is supplied to subtractor 180.<br>
[0036] Multiplier 125 is coupled to sine function 105 and current sensor<br>
295, and is configured to receive the ib value from current sensor 295 and the<br>
sin θ value from sine function 105. Multiplier 125 is further configured to<br>
multiply the ib value and the sin θ value to generate an ibsin θ component.<br>
Multiplier 125 is further coupled to adder 131 and is further configured to<br>

[0037] Adder 131 is also coupled to multiplier 127 and is configured to<br>
receive an iacos θ component from multiplier 127 and the ibsin θ component<br>

current sensor 290 and is configured to receive the ia value from the current<br>
sensor and multiply the cos 9 value and the ia value to generate an iacos θ<br>
component.<br>
[0038] Adder 131 is also configured to sum the iacos θ component and the<br>
ibsin 9 component to generate an (iacos θ + ibsin θ) value, which is a direct-<br><br>
phase current (id) value. Adder 131 is further coupled to comparator 116 and<br>
is further configured to transmit the id value to comparator 116.<br>
[0039] Comparator 116 is coupled to a direct-phase reference current source<br>
(not shown) and is configured to receive a direct-phase reference current (id-ref)<br>
value from the direct-phase reference current source. Comparator 116 is also<br>
onfigured to compare the id value supplied from adder 131 to the id-ref value<br>
to determine a direct-phase current error, and to transmit the determined<br>
direct-phase current error to controller 149.<br>
[0040] Controller 149 is coupled to comparator 116 and is configured to<br>

149 and cosine function 107, respectively. Multiplier 129 is further<br>

(vconA), and to transmit vconA to comparator 118.<br>
[0043] Multiplier 175 is coupled to sine function 105 and subtractor 171,<br>
and is configured to receive the Vd value and the sin 9 value from controller<br>
149 and sine function 105, respectively. Multiplier 175 is further configured<br>

voltage source, and compare vconB and vtri to generate switching commands for<br>
the plurality of B-phase switches based on the comparison (e.g., vconB 
VconB &gt; Vtri). The switching commands transmitted to the A-phase and B-phase<br>
switches are such that the switches in converter 200 turn ON/OFF such that ia<br>
and ib vary in a manner to properly charge a load (not shown) connected to<br>
converter 200.<br>
[0047] FIG. 3 is a diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a D-Q control<br>

the current sensor. Delay function 785 is also configured to transmit the ib<br>
value to multipliers 123 and 125 such that system 400 operates to provide<br>
switching commands to switches 160 and 165 in a manner similar to system<br>
300 discussed above.<br>
[0049] FIG. 4 is a diagram representing a "real" phase and an "imaginary"<br>
phase in a two-phase balance system, wherein the imaginary phase is<br>
orthogonal to the real phase. Here, the imaginary phase includes reference<br>
numeral 785 similar to delay function 785 discussed above with reference to<br>
FIG. 3. Though delay function 785 is not the equivalent of the imaginary<br>
phase, the ib value that delay function 785 generates (based in the ia value) and<br>
provides to system 400 is the equivalent of the ib value that system 300<br>
receives from the b-phase of converter 200 via current sensor 295. That is,<br>
because the two-phases in converter 200 are separated by 90 degrees, by<br>
delaying (via delay function 785) the ia value in converter 100, a single-phase<br>
full bridge boost converter is capable of functioning similar to a two-phase full<br>
bridge boost converter. The following discussion presents a mathematical<br>
explanation of system 400.<br>
[0050] FIG. 5 represents the transformation between the two-phase and D-Q<br>
phase reference frames of converter 100 and system 400, which reference<br>
frames are represented by the trigonometric relations given in equations (1)<br>
and (2). In addition, the voltage and current vectors of converter 100 in the D-<br>
Q reference frame are depicted in FIG. 6.<br><br><br><br>
[0051] In equations (1) and (2), the variable "f" can be defined as a set of<br>
voltages or currents in converter 100. Based on FIG. 6, active and reactive<br>
power equations in the synchronous frame can be written as follows:<br><br>
[0052] The q-axis is chosen to be aligned with the phase voltage vector of<br>
converter 100 or the "real" circuit, which means that the direct-phase voltage<br>
(Vd) is equal to zero (vd=0) and the quadrature-phase voltage (vq) is equal to<br>
the magnitude of the grid voltage (v) in converter 100 (vq=|v|). With these vd<br>
and vq values, the equations for the active and reactive power can be<br>
simplified as:<br><br>
[0053] Since the grid voltage, |v|, is a constant, active and reactive power<br>
can be controlled by controlling the quadrature-phase current (iq) and the<br>
direct-phase current (id), respectively.<br>
[0054] Using Kirchhoff s voltage law, the voltage equations in FIG. 5 can<br>
be written as:<br><br><br>
[0055] Transforming the voltage equations into the synchronous reference<br>
frame using equations (1) and (2), and considering that vd=0 and vq=|v|,<br>
equation (7) results in:<br><br>
[0056] To provide decoupled control of active power or iq, and reactive<br>
power or id, based on equation (8), the output voltages of converter 100 in the<br>
synchronous reference frame should be chosen as:<br><br>
[0057] By substituting equations (9) and (10) into equation (8), the<br>
decoupled equations of system 400 can be rewritten as follows:<br><br>
[0058] As can be seen from equations (5) and (6), the active and reactive<br>
power may be controlled through iq and id, respectively. Therefore, the control<br>
rules of equations (9) and (10) can be completed by defining the current<br>
feedback loops as follows:<br><br>
That is, system 400 is configured to issue switching commands to converter<br>
100 consistent with equations (12) and (13).<br><br>
[0059] FIG. 7 is a block diagram of one exemplary embodiment of a system<br>
500 for charging a load 175 (e.g., a battery). The various embodiments of<br>
system 500 enable active and reactive power in system 500 to be<br>
independently controlled by a V-Q transformation.<br>
[0060] As illustrated in FIG. 7, system 500, at least in this embodiment,<br>
comprises system 400 integrated with converter 100. In doing such, system<br>
500 comprises a current sensor 591, a voltage sensor 593, a DC reference<br>
voltage source 595, a direct-phase reference current source 597, and a<br>
triangular waveform reference voltage source 599.<br>
[0061] Current sensor 591 is coupled between AC voltage source 110 and<br>
inductor 115 of converter 100, and is also coupled to multiplier 121, multiplier<br>
127, and delay function 785 of system 400. Current sensor 591 is configured<br>
to detect ia in converter 100 and transmit the detected ia value to each of delay<br>
function 785, multiplier 121, and multiplier 127.<br>
[0062] Voltage sensor 593 is coupled in parallel with capacitor 170 via<br>
nodes 521 and 523, and is coupled to comparator 112. Voltage sensor 593 is<br>
configured to detect Vdc in converter 100 and transmit the detected Vdc value to<br>
comparator 112.<br>
[0063] DC reference voltage source 595 is also coupled to comparator 112.<br>
DC reference voltage source 595 is configured to provide the DC reference<br>
voltage (Vdc-ref) to comparator 112, wherein Vdc-ref is a predetermined or desired<br>
voltage value within converter 100.<br>
[0064] Direct-phase reference current source 597 is coupled to comparator<br>
116 and is configured to transmit the direct-phase reference current (id-ref)<br>
value to comparator 116. In one embodiment, id-ref includes a value of zero<br>
amps for unity power factor operation, although other embodiments may<br>
include a different value for id-ref.<br>
[0065] Triangular waveform reference voltage source 599 is coupled to<br>
comparator 118 and is configured to provide the triangular waveform<br>
reference voltage (vtri) to comparator 118. The vtri is a threshold voltage that,<br><br>
when compared to vcon, dictates whether the switching commands issued to<br>
switches 160 and 165 turn switches 160 and 165 ON or OFF.<br>
[0066] It should be noted that when implementing system 400 with<br>
converter 100, the reference currents (id-ref and iq-ref) in system 400 should be<br>
chosen as two times the desired values. The reference currents should be<br>
doubled because system 400 does not deliver any active or reactive power to,<br>
or absorb any active or reactive power from AC voltage source 110.<br>
[0067] During operation of system 500, comparator 112 receives vdc (i.e.,<br>
the voltage value detected between node 521 and node 523) from voltage<br>
sensor 593 and vdc-ref from DC reference voltage source 595. At substantially<br>
the same time, delay function 785, multiplier 121, and multiplier 127 receive ia<br>
(i.e., the current value detected between AC voltage source 110 and inductor<br>
115) from current sensor 591.<br>
[0068] Comparator 112 compares vdc to Vdc-ref to determine the voltage error<br>
in converter 100 and transmits the voltage error to controller 143. Controller<br>
143 determines the iq-ref value needed to offset the voltage error and transmits<br>
the determined iq-ref value to comparator 114.<br>
[0069] Comparator 114 also receives an iq value from subtractor 180 and<br>
compares the iq value to the iq-ref value to determine a quadrature-phase current<br>
error. Comparator 114 then transmits the quadrature-phase current error to<br>
controller 146.<br>
[0070] Controller 146 receives the quadrature-phase current error and<br>
determines a vq value that would properly control switches 160, 165 based on<br>
the detected ia and vdc values in converter 100. Controller 146 then transmits<br>
the determined vq value to multiplier 120.<br>
[0071] Multiplier 120 receives the vq value from controller 146 and a sin 9<br>
value from sine function 105, wherein sine function 105 receives a phase<br>
angle (θ) from PLL 103. Multiplier 120 multiplies the vq value and the sin θ<br>
value to generate a vqsin θ component of vcon, and transmits the vqsin θ<br>
component to adder 133 (described below).<br><br>
[0072] As noted above, the current value ia detected by current sensor 591 is<br>
supplied to delay function 785, multiplier 121, and multiplier 125. Delay<br>
function 785 provides a 90 degree delay to ia to generate an ib value (that is the<br>
equivalent of an ib value generated by the b-phase of a two-phase full bridge<br>
boost converter). Delay function 785 then transmits the ib (i.e., the ia value +<br>
90°) value to multipliers 123 and 125. Multiplier 123 multiplies the ib value<br>
and a cos θ value received from cosine function 107 to generate an ibcos θ<br>
value, wherein cosine function 107 received the phase angle (θ) from PLL<br>
103. Multiplier 123 then transmits the ibcos θ value to subtractor 180.<br>
Multiplier 125 multiplies the ib value and the sin θ value received from sine<br>
function 105 to generate an ibsin θ value. Multiplier 125 then transmits the<br>
ibsin θ value to adder 131.<br>
[0073] Multiplier 121 multiplies the ia value and the sin θ value received<br>
from sine function 105 to generate an iasin θ value. Multiplier 121 then<br>
transmits the iasin θ value to subtractor 180 so that subtractor 180 may subtract<br>
the ibcos θ value supplied from multiplier 123 from the iasin θ value to<br>
generate an (iasin θ-ibcos θ) value or the iq value.<br>
[0074] Multiplier 127 multiplies the ia value and the cos θ value received<br>
from cosine function 107 to generate an iacos θ value. Multiplier 127 then<br>
transmits the iacos θ value to adder 131. Adder 131 sums the iacos θ value and<br>
the ibsin θ value supplied from multiplier 125 to generate an (iacos θ + ibsin θ)<br>
value or id value. Adder 131 then transmits the id value to comparator 116.<br>
[0075] Comparator 116 receives the id value from adder 131 and an id-ref<br>
value from direct-phase reference current source 597. Comparator 116 then<br>
compares id to id-ref and generates a direct-phase current error based on the<br>
comparison. The direct-phase current error is then transmitted to controller<br>
149.<br>
[0076] Controller 149 receives the direct-phase current error and determines<br>
a Vd value that would properly control switches 160, 165 based on the detected<br>
ia and Vdc values. Controller 149 then transmits the determined Vd value to<br>
multiplier 129.<br><br>
[0077] Multiplier 129 receives the vd value from controller 149 and the cos θ<br>
value from cosine function 107. Multiplier 129 then multiplies the vd value<br>
and the cos θ value to generate a vdcos θ component of vcon, and transmits the<br>
vdcos θ component to adder 133.<br>
[0078] Adder 133 receives the vqsin θ component from multiplier 120 and<br>
the vdcos θ component from multiplier 129 and sums the vqsin θ component<br>
and the vdcos θ component to generate a (vqsin θ + vdcos θ) value or vcon value.<br>
Adder 133 then transmits the vcon value to comparator 118.<br>
[0079] Comparator 118 receives the vcon value from adder 133 and a vtri<br>
value from waveform reference voltage source 599 and compares vcon to vtri.<br>
Comparator 118 then transmits switching commands to switches 160, 165<br>
based on the comparison of vcon and vtri. For example, if vcon is greater than vtri<br>
(i.e., vcon &gt; vtri), the switching commands turn switches 160, 165 ON, whereas<br>
if vcon is less than vtri (i.e., vcon 
160 and 165 OFF so that converter 100 operates similar to the discussion<br>
above with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
[0080] Notably, setting id-ref to zero volts yields unity power factor<br>
operation in system 500. Furthermore, id-ref set to zero volts yields a low total<br>
harmonic distortion and exceptional "zero crossing" characteristics.<br>
[0081] As one skilled in the art will recognize, system 400 may be<br>
implemented using computing hardware (and software), a computing device,<br>
and/or a computing system. That is, various embodiments of the invention<br>
contemplate that system 400 may be implemented via a processor, and<br>
specifically, a digital signal processor.<br>

foregoing detailed description of the invention, it should be appreciated that a<br>
vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the<br>
