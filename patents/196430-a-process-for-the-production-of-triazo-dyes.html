The present  invention relates to  a process  for<br>
production of trisazo dyes  of  the general formula  I<br><br>
where<br>
R1      is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, halogen, nitro, hydroxysulfonyl, sulfamoyl, mono- or di-C1~C4-alkylsulfamoyl, C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl or C1-C4-alkoxysulfonyl,<br>
R2      is hydrogen, halogen, nitro or hydroxysulfonyl, at least one of R1 and R2 being nitro,<br>
R3 and R4 are each independently of the other hydroxyl or amino,<br>
R5      is hydrogen, C1-C^alkyl, hydroxysulfonyl, sulfamoyl, mono- or di-C1-C^-alkylsulfamoyl, C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl, C1-C4-alkoxysulfonyl or carboxyl,<br>
R6      is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl,<br>
R7      is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, hydroxysulfonyl, sulfa.ir.oyl, mono- or di-C1-C4-alkylsulfamoyl, C1-C4-alkylsulfonyl, C1-C4-alkoxysulfonyl, S02N{CH2COOH)2 or carboxyl,<br>
R8      is hydrogen, C1-C4-alkyl, hydroxyl, C1-C4-alkoxy, halogen or nitro,<br>
with the proviso that at least one of R5 and R7 is COOH or S03H and when R5 or R7 is S03H the other is COOH, or R3 and/or R4 are each amino or R1 is hydrogen or RG is alkyl,<br>
in free form or as transition metal complexes, and to their use for dyeing leather, textile fibers and paper.<br><br>
Acid trisazo dyes which produce brown hues are well known and are used for example for dyeing leather, textiles and paper (see for example DE-A-22 38 159, US-2 259 734 and WO 81/03179). The dyes were used either in free form or in the form of metal complexes, especially as copper complexes.<br>
3owever, the known dyes leave something to be desired as regards their lightfastness, washfastness and perspiration fastness and their dyeing behavior, for example as regards the degree of Liquor exhaustion.<br>
[t is an object of the present invention to provide novel trisazo Jyes which are superior to the known dyes as regards Lightfastness, washfastness and perspiration fastness and/or Syeing behavior.<br>
â– to have found-that this object is achieved by the trisazo dyes of :he general formula I mentioned at the beginning.<br>
Suitable R1, R5, R6, R7 and R8 include for example the Ci-C4-alkyl radicals methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl. Methyl is preferred.<br>
Suitable Rl, R5 and R7 include for example mono- or ii-Ci-Ca-alkylsulfamoyl radicals, Ci-C4-alkylsulfonyl radicals and :i-C4-alkoxysulfonyl radicals with the alkyl radicals mentioned.<br>
Suitable R8 includes for example Ci-C4-alkoxy radicals with the ilkyl groups mentioned.<br>
suitable R1, R2 and R8 include the halogens fluorine, chlorine, iromine and iodine, preferably chlorine and bromine.<br>
'referred R1 and R2 are hydrogen, hydroxysulfonyl and nitro, in particular hydrogen and nitro, at least one of the radicals R1 or l2, preferably both, being nitro. R1 and R2 are each preferably lisposed meta to the diazo group.<br>
I3 and R4 are preferably identical. The diazo groups coupled to :he same phenyl ring are both preferably disposed ortho to them, resulting in a 1,2,4,5-substituted phenyl ring.<br>
Preferred R5 is COOH, SO3H, methyl and hydrogen, of which carboxyl is particularly preferred.<br><br>
Preferred R6 is hydrogen and methyl. Hydrogen is the preferred R6 in combination with COOB, SO3H or hydrogen as R5. R6 is preferably nethyl when R5 is methyl too.<br>
Preferred R7 is SO3B and COOH.<br>
Particularly preferred dyes are those in which either R5 or R7 is carboxyl.<br>
Preferred R8 is hydrogen, methyl and hydroxyl.<br>
Che trisazo dyes of the present invention can be used in the free Eorm or in the form of their metal salts.<br>
Suitable transition metals for complexing with the trisa2o dyes ire in particular the elements of subgroups 6, 7 and 8 of the periodic table and also copper, especially chromium, iron, ;obalt, nickel and copper, and iron complexes are particularly preferred.<br>
Particular preference is given to the iron complexes of the Eollowing trisazo dyes, which are obtained by reacting one mol equivalent of dye with 0.5 to 2 mol equivalents of iron salt:<br><br><br><br>
Preference is given to iron complexes of the dyes Ia-d with a 1:1 stoichiometry and to the iron complexes of the dyes la and b with a 2:1 stoichiometry of the starting materials (iron salt/dye).<br>
Suitable iron salts are water-soluble iron(II) salts such as iron(II) chloride, iron(II) sulfate, iron(II) carbonate and iron(II) acetate and preferably iron(lll) salts such as iron(III) sulfate, iron(IH) chlorate, iron(III) nitrate and especially iron(III) chloride.<br>
The dyes of the formula I can be prepared in a conventional manner, for example by diazotizing an aminophenol of the general formula II<br><br><br>
where R3 and R4 are each as defined above. The resulting monoazo compound IV<br><br>
where R5, R6, R7 and RB are each as defined above, to obtain the dyes of the general formula I.<br>
The aminoazo compounds V are obtained for example by reacting the diazonium salt of an amine VI<br><br>
and subsequent hydrolysis of the resulting monoazo compound to<br>
the aminoazc	** "<br><br>
The order of the coupling reactions can also be changed. The optionally subsequent metallization of the trisazo dye is effected by known methods.<br>
The dyes of the present invention are notable for high lightfastness, good washfastness and perspiration fastness properties, especially with respect to discolorations of cotton fabrics, and good dyeing properties, for example good liquor exhaustion, in the case of leather dyeings.<br>
The dyes are particularly suitable for dyeing leather, textile fibers and paper. Any kind of leather can be dyed, such as grain and sueds leather, chrome leather, retanned leather or velour leather from goat, sheep, cow and pig. Of the textile fibers, cotton, wool and pofyamide fibers are particularly suitable.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for production of trisazo dyes of the general formula I<br><br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of the trisazo dye<br><br>
a)	25 g (0.182 mol) of sodium formaldehyde bisulfite were<br>
dissolved in 6 ml of water at 50Â°C. 14.3 g (0.104 mol) of<br>
anthranilic acid were added to the solution. The mixture was<br>
stirred at 95Â°C for 4 hours. 17.3 g (0.1 mol) of sulfanilic<br>
acid first diazotized in a conventional manner were then<br>
added at 25Â°C while the pH was held at 6.0 with sodium<br>
bicarbonate. The mixture was subsequently stirred at 0 - 5Â°C<br>
for 3 hours. 25 ml of 501 strength by weight sodium hydroxide<br>
were then added, and the mixture was heated at 90 Â°C for 4<br>
hours. After cooling to 20Â°C, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with<br>
hydrochloric acid, the suspension was subsequently stirred<br>
for 2 hours, and the product was filtered off with suction.<br>
b)	22.1 g (0.1 mol) of sodium picramate were diazotized in a<br>
conventional manner and coupled with 10.4 g (0.095 mol) of<br>
resorcinol at pH 9.0. The diazonium salt of 32.1 g (0.1 mol)<br>
of the product of a) was added to the suspension at pH 8-9.<br><br>
s<br>
After the coupling had ended, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 with dilute hydrochloric acid. 16.1 g (0.1 mol) of anhydrous iron(III) chloride were then added at 60Â°C,   and the mixture was stirred at pH 4.0 for 1 hour. The precipitated trisazo dye was filtered off with suction and dried at 60Â°C,   giving 136g of an NaCl- comprising solid.<br>
Iron complexes of the dyes listed in the following table taking x mol equivalent of iron and y mol equivalents of dye as the starting point were prepared in a similar manner: x:y<br><br>
