DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance to the present invention the implant transportation device for oral, maxillofacial and orthopadic implants, being presently disclosed comprises of main cylindrical body having an all-through hole, a spring and pulling means. The one end of the said main cylindrical body is preferably provided with stepped diameter body, which in-turn is provided with the desired screw driving means. The another end of the said main cylindrical body is closed end and provided with a means to hold the said spring. The said desired screw driving means preferably extends in to a cylindrical part, which in-turn ends in to the said pulling means. Such pulling means, in accordance to one of the preferred embodiment of the present invention rests in the longitudinal slots<br><br>
provided in the said main cylindrical body. Such said longitudinal slots are preferably opposite to each other extending from one end towards another end of the said main cylindrical body.<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said spring is fixed onto the said pulling means on one end and to the opposite end of the said main cylindrical body on another end.<br>
In accordance to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the said pulling means extends further in to cylindrical part preferably having stepped diameter end, on to which one end of the said spring is made to sit and another end of the said spring sits on to the means for such purpose provided on to the closed end of the said main cylindrical body.<br>
In accordance to still another one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said another end of the said main cylindrical body is preferably provided with a stopper to hold the said implant transportation device with desired implant in the glass tube.<br>
Now referring to figure-1, the implant transportation device for oral, maxillofacial and orthopadic implants, as disclosed in the present invention comprises of a main cylindrical body (1) having an all-through hole (2), a spring (3) and pulling means (4). The one end (5) of the said main cylindrical body (1) is preferably provided with reduced diameter body (6), which in-turn has the desired screw driving means (7). The another end (8) of the said cylindrical body (1) is preferably flat or hemispherical in shape. Now referring to figure-2, in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present<br><br>
invention the said another end (8) of the said cylindrical body (1) is preferably provided with a stopper (9) to hold the said implant transportation device with desired implant (not shown in the figure) in the glass tube (not shown in the figure).<br>
Now referring to figures 3 &amp; 4, in accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention said one end (5) of the said main cylindrical body (1) is provided with stepped diameter body (6), which in-turn is provided with the desired screw driving means (7). The another end (8) of the said main cylindrical body (1) is closed end and provided with a means (10) to hold the said spring (3). The said desired screw driving means (7) extends in to a cylindrical part (11), which in-turn ends in to the said pulling means (4). Such pulling means (4), in accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention rests in the longitudinal slots (12) provided in the said main cylindrical body (1). Such said longitudinal slots (12) are preferably opposite to each other extending from one end (5) towards another end (8) of the said main cylindrical body(1).<br>
In accordance to one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention the said spring (3) is fixed onto the said pulling means (4) on one end and on to the said means (10) provided on to the said opposite end (8) of said main cylindrical body (1) [figures 1 &amp; 2].<br>
In accordance to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention the said pulling means (4) extends further in to cylindrical part (13) preferably having stepped diameter end (14), on to which one end of the said spring (3) is made to sit and another end of the said spring (3) sits on to the means (10) for such purpose provided on to the closed end (8) of the said main cylindrical body (1) [figures-3 &amp; 4].<br><br>
In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the said implant (not shown in the figure) alongwith the said implant transportation device is pulled out of the said glass tube (not shown in the figure). The said implant alongwith the said implant transportation device of the present invention is placed in the cavity drilled previously for the said oral or maxillofacial or orthopadic implant. The said implant is screwed into the said previously tapped cavity for the said implant by constantly rotating the main cylindrical body (1) till the implant is firmly fitted in the said cavity. The pulling means (4) are pushed towards the end (8) by placing fingers around the pulling means (4) and thumb on the end (8) or the stopper (9) after the said implant is firmly fitted in the said cavity for the said oral or maxillofacial or orthopadic implant. The pulling action is continued till the said implant is left in the said cavity and the implant transportation device, disclosed in the present invention, is released.<br>
The main advantage of the present invention as understood from the forgoing description is that the said implant is transported from the factory to the hospital and finally to the implantation site without any touch and chance of contamination.<br>
The present invention has been explained with the help of the accompanying figures, which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It is obvious to those, who are skilled in the art of the invention, that various modification of the presently disclosed device are possible without deviating from the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
