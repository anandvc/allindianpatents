				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
THERMALLY SENSITIVE RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium which utilizes color developing reaction of a colorless or pale<br>
colored basic leuco dye with a color developing agent, in particular, relates<br>
to a thermally sensitive recording medium which is excellent in color<br>
developing sensitivity and quality of developed image.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, a thermally sensitive recording medium having a<br>
thermally sensitive recording layer whose main components are colorless or<br>
pale colored electron donating leuco dye (hereinafter shortened to dye) and<br>
electron accepting color developing agent (hereinafter shortened to color<br>
developing agent) that develops color when heated with a dye is practically<br>
used widely. A thermal printer in which a thermal head is built in is used to<br>
record images on it. This thermally sensitive recording method has<br>
advantages that, noiseless at recording process, developing process and<br>
fixing process are not necessary, maintenance free, an apparatus is<br>
relatively cheap and compact and a obtained color is very clear, therefore, is<br>
widely applied in the field of a facsimile, a terminal printer of computer, an<br>
automatic ticket vendor, a recorder for measuring instrument or a handy<br>
terminal that is used in outdoor. As uses of this thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium, besides above mentioned output paper for various<br>
instruments, the thermally sensitive recording medium are becoming to be<br>
used in the field of a paper for note to which good preservability is required.<br>
Along with the diversification of uses, recording instrument itself is<br>
disversified and becoming high performance (high speed, compact),<br>
accordingly, for the thermally sensitive recoding medium, a product which<br>
has higher color developing sensitivity and can obtain high quality<br>
recorded image in all range from lower printing density to higher printing<br>
sensitivity.<br>
In general, as the method to improve color developing sensitivity and<br>
quality of developed image, a method to improve smoothness of an under<br><br>
coating layer formed on the surface of a thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium or between a substrate and thermally sensitive recording layer by<br>
a super calendar is well known.<br>
In Patent Document 1, for the purpose to provide a thermally<br>
sensitive recording material which is excellent in dot reappearance ability<br>
(quality of image), a technique to laminate first intermediate layer and<br>
second intermediate layer in order between substrate and thermally<br>
sensitive color developing layer, wherein Ohken smoothness of the first<br>
intermediate layer is 700 seconds or more and density of the second<br>
intermediate layer is 0.1 or less is disclosed. In Patent Document 2, a<br>
technique to contain scale shape silica particles in an intermediate layer<br>
formed between a substrate and a thermally sensitive recording layer is<br>
disclosed. However, in a case when the smoothness of the thermally<br>
sensitive recording medium is improved by means of super calendar,<br>
although high quality recorded image can be obtained, porosity (abiabatic<br>
ability) of the layers which construct a thermally sensitive medium is<br>
deteriorated by calendar pressure. Accordingly, thermal efficiency at the<br>
thermally sensitive layer is deteriorated and high color developing<br>
sensitivity can not be obtained. Further, recently, since the required level<br>
for quality of image is becoming higher, sufficient quality can not be<br>
obtained by only improving the smoothness of the surface of the thermally<br>
sensitive recording medium or the under coating layer.<br>
Further, along with the diversification of uses, a thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium to which fixed informations such as logo mark or ruled<br>
lines are previously printed by a common printing method such as offset<br>
printing is becoming to be used more frequently, accordingly, a high<br>
lustrous thermally sensitive recording medium having aptitude for a<br>
common printing, especially high lustrous aptitude for a printed part is<br>
required.<br>
In Patent Document 3, for the purpose to improve aptitude for a<br>
common printing and lustor of thermally sensitive recording medium, an<br>
art characterized to contain aluminum hydroxide in a thermally sensitive<br>
layer is disclosed and in Patent Document 4, an art to form a protecting<br>
layer for the purpose to obtain high lustrous thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium is disclosed. However, when a protection layer is formed, since<br>
heat conduction to a thermally sensitive recording layer becomes slow, not<br><br>
only disadvantages such as deterioration of sensitivity, deterioration of<br>
printing speed or increase of printing energy cause, but also a problem of<br>
production cost rising causes because numbers of coating layer are<br>
increased.<br>
Further, for the purpose to obtain high color developing sensitivity,<br>
there is an art to blend a silica having high oil absorbing ability in a<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium and to fix fused dye and color<br>
developing agent, however, when silica is blended, since lustrous of a<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium is deteriorated, problem that high<br>
printing lustrous can not be obtained causes. As mentioned above, at the<br>
present time, a thermally sensitive recording medium having high color<br>
developing sensitivity and characterized that lustrous of printed part is<br>
high when printed by a common printing method such as an offset printing,<br>
is not obtained yet.<br>
Furthermore, since basic leuco dye and color developing agent<br>
contained in a thermally sensitive recording medium can be easily<br>
dissolved in various solvent, the thermally sensitive recording medium has<br>
a problem that the developed color density is deteriorated when a<br>
developed image is contacted with chemicals such as plasticizer contained<br>
in an ink of water mark pen or oily mark pen or an adhesive. In Patent<br>
Documents 5 and 6, for the purpose to overcome said defect, an art to form<br>
a protecting layer containing a pigment and a resin as main components on<br>
a thermally sensitive recording medium is disclosed.<br>
However, recently, uses of a thermally sensitive recording medium are<br>
extending widely, for example, for various tickets, receipt, label, for ATM<br>
use of bank, for inspection of city gas or water supply or for a note of cycle<br>
race or horse race. Therefore, severe requirement for feature of the<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium is rising, which is not required to a<br>
conventional thermally sensitive recording medium. Since these cases of<br>
use are mainly outdoor use, the function of an over coating layer, which can<br>
endure practical use in more severe environment compared with the<br>
conventional use such as rain, water, humid, sun shine or in a car of<br>
summer, becomes necessary. However, when such kind of protecting layer is<br>
formed, although stability can be improved, above mentioned disadvantage<br>
such as deterioration of sensitivity, deterioration of printing speed or<br>
increase of printing energy are caused, further, large friction is caused<br><br>
between pigment such as silica contained in a protecting layer with a head,<br>
a problem of abrasion of a head is caused when continuously used for long<br>
time.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium which is superior in color developing sensitivity and<br>
quality of developed image.<br>
The inventors of the present invention continued earnest<br>
investigation, and found out that above mentioned object can be dissolved<br>
by a thermally sensitive recording medium comprising, single or multi<br>
layers, wherein, at least one layer on a substrate is a thermally sensitive<br>
recording layer that contains a colorless or pale colored electron donating<br>
leuco dye and an electron accepting color developing agent, further, at least<br>
one layer formed on the substrate contains a pigment whose aspect ratio is<br>
30 or more. Especially, by using kaolin as a pigment whose aspect ratio is<br>
30 or more, more excellent effect can be obtained.<br>
Further, by containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more in<br>
the outermost surface of the thermally sensitive recording medium, not<br>
only above mentioned object is dissolved but also displays high lustrous,<br>
aptitude for a common printing, especially high lustrous aptitude of printed<br>
part. In particular, by containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or<br>
more in a protect layer, can display excellent effect in preservative stability<br>
of the recorded image part and the white ground part and abrasion<br>
resistance of a head.<br>
BRIEF ILLUSTRATION OF DRAWING<br>
Fig.l is an illustrating drawing of aspect ratio of the present<br>
invention, and aspect ratio is indicated by numerical value calculated by<br>
dividing diameter by thickness.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODYMENT<br>
The thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention is<br>
characterized by containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more in<br>
at least one layer formed on a substrate. In the present invention, the term<br>
of "aspect ratio of a pigment" means numerical value calculated as follows.<br>
That is, powder is photographed by an electric microscope and 100 particles<br>
are picked up at random, and aspect ratio of each 100 particles are<br>
calculated and averaged, wherein, larger aspect ratio means that the<br>
pigment has larger flatness.<br>
Aspect ratio=diameter/thickness       (formula l)<br>
The pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more, which is used in the<br>
present invention is very flat compared with a pigment which is generally<br>
used as a paper manufacturing materials, and a coating layer containing<br>
the pigment has excellent covering ability, surface flatness and lustrous.<br>
The reason why can be conjectured as follows. That is, the necessary<br>
weight of the pigment having larger aspect ratio is lighter than that of the<br>
pigment having smaller aspect ratio. For example, when a pigment A<br>
whose aspect ratio is 20 and a pigment B whose aspect ratio is 40 are<br>
compared, the minimum necessary amount of the pigment B is<br>
theoretically half to the minimum necessary amount of the pigment A.<br>
Therefore, a coating layer having high covering ability can be formed by<br>
small amount of a coating. And, since the thickness of a pigment whose<br>
aspect ratio is large is thin, unevenness at the coated layer surface becomes<br>
small. Therefore, excellent surface flatness and luster can be displayed.<br>
Further a coating containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is large, has a<br>
tendency that the particles of the pigment are oriented so as the flat<br>
surface to turn upward at the coating process, and can easily display good<br>
covering ability, surface flatness and luster. In a case of the method for<br>
coating characterized that strong share is loaded, such as blade coater, this<br>
tendency becomes more remarkable. Further, when particles of pigment are<br>
oriented so as the flat surface to turn upward, since penetration into a<br>
substrate or into inner part of a coating layer is protected, coating ability,<br>
surface flatness and lustrous are improved. As mentioned above, by<br>
containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is large in a thermally sensitive<br>
recording layer, good surface flatness is performed, therefore, it is possible<br><br>
to control the treating pressure by a super calendar which provides aimed<br>
flatness, to the minimum level. Consequently, a thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium characterized to be porous and to be excellent in surface<br>
flatness can be obtained. Regarding a thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more of the<br>
present invention, cases that said pigment is contained in protecting layer,<br>
thermally sensitive recording layer and under coating layer will be<br>
illustrated below.<br>
As the first, the case that a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more<br>
is contained in a protecting layer will be illustrated. In the present<br>
invention, when a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is contained in<br>
a protecting layer, which is the outermost surface layer, it is possible to<br>
cover a thermally sensitive recording layer by smaller coating amount than<br>
conventional protecting layer. The construction of the thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium that contains a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more<br>
in the protecting layer, which is the outermost surface layer, there are<br>
combinations of (thermally sensitive recording layer)/(protecting layer) or<br>
(undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording layer)/(protecting layer),<br>
and the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more can be added to the other<br>
layers too, besides the protecting layer.<br>
By forming a protecting layer containing a pigment whose aspect<br>
ratio is 30 or more, preservative stability of the recorded image part and<br>
the white ground part are improved and deterioration of heat conduction to<br>
a thermally sensitive recording layer is protected, accordingly good color<br>
developing sensitivity and good recorded image can be obtained. Further,<br>
by containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more, smoothness and<br>
luster of surface of a coating layer are improved. Therefore, required<br>
smoothness can be obtained by a low pressure super calendar and good<br>
color developing sensitivity and good recorded image can be obtained.<br>
When the average diameter of the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or<br>
more contained in a protecting layer is larger than 4μm, the pigment is<br>
exposed on the surface of the coating layer and causes problems such as<br>
deterioration of surface flatness, deterioration of quality of recorded image,<br>
deterioration of luster, deterioration of luster of printed part or increase of<br>
abrasion with a thermal head. Therefore, it is desirable that the particle<br>
size of the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is 4 μm or less. Further,<br><br>
when oil absorbing amount of a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is<br>
30-100ml/100g, ink fixing ability and luster of printed part in common<br>
printing becomes good. When the oil absorbing amount of a pigment whose<br>
aspect ratio is 30 or more is 30ml/100g or less, problem causes in ink fixing<br>
ability, because the ink for common printing is hard to be absorbed, and<br>
when the oil absorbing amount of a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or<br>
more is over than 100 ml/100g, since the ink for common printing is<br>
excessively absorbed, a thermally sensitive recording medium having high<br>
luster of printed part can not be obtained.<br>
When the aspect ratio of a pigment contained in a protecting layer is<br>
100 or more, problems of deterioration of ink fixing ability or ink drying<br>
feature in common printing and deterioration of color developing sensitivity<br>
are caused, because the density of the protecting layer becomes too high.<br>
Therefore, the desirable aspect ratio of the pigment contained in the<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium is 30-100, more desirably is 30-75.<br>
As a sort of inorganic pigment used in the present invention, for<br>
example, kaolin, (calcined) kaolin, calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide,<br>
titanium oxide, magnesium carbonate, aluminum silicate, magnesium<br>
silicate, calcium silicate, aluminum hydroxide, diatomaceous earth or talk<br>
can be mentioned, however, not intending to be limited to them. Among<br>
these inorganic pigments, an inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or<br>
more is preferably used. The inorganic pigment used in the present<br>
invention has a characteristic in its shape and ratio of thin board shape<br>
particles is larger when compared with that of ordinary used pigment. And<br>
in the present invention, a pigment that has said shape is preferably used<br>
or a pigment classified so as to meet the regulation of the present invention<br>
is used.<br>
Further, it is desirable to use the inorganic pigment whose aspect<br>
ratio is 30 or more by alone, because it displays its effect by its specific<br>
shape, however, it can be used together with various pigments whose<br>
aspect ratio is less than 30 within the limit that the weight parts of the<br>
inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is more than 50 weight<br>
parts, more desirably 80 weight parts to 100 weight parts of total blending<br>
part of pigments.<br>
As an inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more, from the<br>
view point of head abrasion resistance, aluminum hydroxide, silica or<br><br>
kaolin is desirable. Especially, from the view point of quality of image,<br>
sensitivity, aptitude for a common printing and economy, kaolin is desirable.<br>
This kind of kaolin can be obtained by specifically grinding, delaminating<br>
and classifying kaolin.<br>
To the protecting layer of the present invention, as a binder, for<br>
example, completely saponified polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of<br>
polymerization of 200 to 1,900, partially saponified polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
acetoacetyl polyvinyl alcohol, carboxy denatured polyvinyl alcohol, amide<br>
denatured polyvinyl alcohol, sulfonic acid denatured polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
butyral denatured polyvinyl alcohol, olefin denatured polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
nitrile denatured polyvinyl alcohol, pyrorrydone denatured polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, silicone denatured polyvinyl alcohol, other denatured polyvinyl<br>
alcohol, hydroxyethylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer,<br>
styrene-butadiene copolymer, cellulose derivative such as ethylcellulose or<br>
acetylcellulose, casein, gum arabic, starch oxide, etherificated starch,<br>
dialdehyde starch, esterficated starch, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate,<br>
polyacrylamide, polyacrylate, polyvinyl butyral, polystyrol and a copolymer<br>
thereof, polyamide resin, silicon resin, petroleum resin, terpene resin,<br>
ketone resin and cumarone resin can be mentioned. Those high molecular<br>
weight substances can be used by dissolving in a solvent such as water,<br>
alcohol, ketones, esters, or hydrocarbon, or emulsifying or dispersing as a<br>
paste in water or another medium. Both methods can be used together in<br>
accordance with required quality.<br>
In general, the containing amount of an inorganic pigment whose<br>
aspect ratio is 30 or more and a binder used in the present invention, solid<br>
parts of a binder is 30-300 weight parts to 100 parts of inorganic pigment.<br>
This protecting layer can be prepared easily by applying a coating on<br>
a thermally sensitive recording layer by coating amount of approximately<br>
l-5g/m2 using an ordinary coating machine. An intermediate layer can be<br>
formed between thermally sensitive recording layer and protecting layer<br>
and the protecting layer can be formed on the intermediate layer. As a<br>
coating method, every well-known methods such as air knife method, blade<br>
method, gravure method, roll coater method or curtain method can be used.<br>
Secondly, a case that a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is<br>
contained in a thermally sensitive recording layer will be illustrated. In the<br><br>
present invention, when a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is<br>
contained in a thermally sensitive recording layer, the construction of the<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium on a substrate, there are<br>
combinations of (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording layer)/<br>
(protecting layer), (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording<br>
layer), (thermally sensitive recording layer)/(protecting layer) and<br>
(thermally sensitive recording layer) alone, and the pigment whose aspect<br>
ratio is 30 or more can be added to other layers besides the protecting layer.<br>
In the present invention, in the case that a pigment whose aspect<br>
ratio is 30 or more is contained in a thermally sensitive recording layer, by<br>
the same reason stated previously to the case contained in the protecting<br>
layer, covering ability and smoothness are improved compared with the<br>
case which uses conventionally used pigment.<br>
Therefore, when the construction of the thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium is (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording layer) or<br>
(thermally sensitive recording layer) alone on a substrate, that is, in the<br>
case that the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is contained in the<br>
outermost layer of the thermally sensitive recording medium, heat from a<br>
thermal head of a thermally sensitive printer is conducted equally and<br>
performs excellent color developing sensitivity, further when printed by a<br>
common printing method such as an offset printing, a thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium whose luster of the printed part is high can be obtained.<br>
And, when the construction of the thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium is (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording<br>
layer)/(protecting layer) or (thermally sensitive recording layer)/(protecting<br>
layer) on a substrate, that is, in the case that the protecting layer is formed<br>
on the thermally sensitive recording layer in which the pigment whose<br>
aspect ratio is 30 or more is contained, since excellent smoothness of the<br>
thermally sensitive recording effects the smoothness of the protecting layer<br>
formed on it and good color developing sensitivity and good quality of the<br>
printed image can be obtained.<br>
In the thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention,<br>
the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 and a pigment that can be used<br>
together with, it is desirable to use similar pigment which can be used in<br>
above mentioned protecting layer. Further, it is desirable to use the<br>
inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more by alone, because it<br><br>
10<br>
displays its effect by its specific shape, however, it can be used together<br>
with various pigments whose aspect ratio is less than 30 within the limit<br>
that the weight parts of the inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or<br>
more is more than 50 weight parts, more desirably 80 weight parts to 100<br>
weight parts of total blending part of pigments.<br>
In the present invention, the blending amount of the pigment whose<br>
aspect ratio is 30 or more contained in the thermally sensitive recording<br>
layer is desirably 10%-70%, more desirably 10%-50% by weight ratio to the<br>
thermally sensitive recording layer. When the blending amount is too small,<br>
smoothness and lustrous degree deteriorate. And when the blending<br>
amount is too much, since the blending ratio of dye and color developing<br>
agent becomes small, good color developing density and recorded image can<br>
not be obtained and if the thermally sensitive recording layer locates at the<br>
outermost surface, head abrasion resistance deteriorates.<br>
As a binder to be used in a thermally sensitive recording layer of the<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium, it is desirable to select voluntarily<br>
from binders used in the protecting layer mentioned above.<br>
Further, in the present invention, a stabilizer which displays oil<br>
resistance effect to the recorded image can be used in the range not<br>
obstructing the desired effect regarding above mentioned object of the<br>
present invention, and as the specific example of the stabilizer,<br>
4,4'-buthylidene (6-t-butyl-3-methylphenol),<br>
2,2'-di-t-butyl-5,5'-dimethyl-4,4'-sulphonyldiphenol,<br>
1,l,3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-cyclohexylphenyl)butane or<br>
l,l,3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-t-butylphenyl)butane can be added.<br>
Furthermore, an U.V. ray absorbing agent such as benzophenons or<br>
triazols, a dispersing agent, a defoamin agent, an anti oxidant agents or a<br>
fluorescent dye can be used.<br>
As an electron donating leuco dye used in the present invention, any<br>
kinds of dye which are public known in fields of pressure sensitive or<br>
thermally sensitive recording medium can be used and not restricted, and<br>
for example, triphenylmethane compounds, fluorane compounds, fluorene<br>
compounds or divinyl compounds are desirably used. Examples of specific<br>
colorless or pale colored dye (dye precursor) are shown as follows. These<br>
dye precursors can be used alone or together with.<br><triphenyl methane leuco dye><br><br>

The kinds and amount of electron donating leuco dye, electron<br>
accepting color developing agent and other components which are used in<br>
the thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention, are<br>
decided according to the required properties and recording suitability and<br>
not restricted, however, in general, 0.5 to 10 parts of electron accepting<br>
color developing agent and 0.5 to 10 parts of sensitizer to 1 part of electron<br>
donating leuco dye are used.<br>
Electron donating leuco dye, electron accepting color developing agent<br>
and other materials to be added by necessity are ground by a grinding<br>
machine such as ball mill, attriter or sand grinder, or by means of an<br>
adequate emulsifying apparatus, until they are ground under several<br><br>
16<br>
micron size, then add a binder and various additives according to the object<br>
and prepare a coating liquid. The means for coating is not restricted and<br>
public known conventional methods can be used, for example, an off<br>
machine coater with various coater such as air knife coater, rod blade<br>
coater, vento blade coater, bevel blade coater or roll coater or an on machine<br>
coater can be voluntarily chosen and used. The coating amount for a<br>
thermally sensitive layer is not specifically restricted, and in general, is in<br>
the range from 2 to 12g/m2 by dry weight.<br>
Finally, a case that a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is<br>
contained in an undercoating layer will be illustrated. In the present<br>
invention, when a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is contained in<br>
an undercoating layer, the construction of the thermally sensitive recording<br>
medium, there are combinations of (undercoating layer)/(thermally<br>
sensitive recording layer)/(protecting layer) and (undercoating<br>
layer)/(thermally sensitive recording layer) on a substrate, and the pigment<br>
whose aspect ratio is 30 or more can be added to other layers besides the<br>
thermally sensitive recording layer.<br>
In the present invention, in the case when the pigment whose aspect<br>
ratio is 30 or more is contained in an undercoating layer in the thermally<br>
sensitive recording medium, by same reason to the case contained in the<br>
protecting layer mentioned above, coating ability and smoothness are<br>
improved compared with the case using conventionally used pigment.<br>
Therefore, in a case when the construction of a thermally sensitive<br>
recording medium is (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive recording<br>
layer)/(protecting layer), (undercoating layer)/(thermally sensitive<br>
recording layer) on a substrate, that is, the case when a thermally sensitive<br>
recording layer and/or a protecting layer is formed on an undercoating<br>
layer containing the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more, since the<br>
undercoating layer having good surface smoothness effects to the<br>
smoothness of the thermally sensitive recording layer and/or the protecting<br>
layer, good color developing sensitivity and good quality of recorded image<br>
can be obtained.<br>
In the thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention,<br>
as a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more and a pigment that can be<br>
used together with contained in the undercoating layer, it is desirable to<br>
use similar one which is used in above mentioned protecting layer. Further,<br><br>
17<br>
the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more is desirable to be used alone<br>
because it displays effect by its specific shape, however, it can be used<br>
together with various pigments whose aspect ratio is less than 30 within<br>
the limit that the weight parts of the inorganic pigment whose aspect ratio<br>
is 30 or more is more than 50 weight parts, more desirably 80 weight parts<br>
to 100 weight parts of total blending part of pigments.<br>
Further, as a binder, it is desirable to voluntarily select from binders<br>
used in above mentioned protecting layer, and the desirable amount is<br>
10-40 weight parts to 100 weight parts of pigment contained in the under<br>
coating layer.<br>
In the present invention, to the protecting layer, the thermally<br>
sensitive recording layer and the undercoating layer, a crosslinking agent<br>
such as grioxal, methylol melamine, melamine formaldehyde resin,<br>
polyamideamine-epichlorohydrine resin, potassium peroxosulfate,<br>
ammonium peroxosulfate, sodium peroxosulfate, ferric chloride,<br>
magnesium chloride, borax, boric acid, alum or ammonium chloride,<br>
metallic salt of fatty acid such as zinc stearate or calcium stearate, slipping<br>
agent such as waxes or silicone resin, dyes, fluorescent dyes, U.V. ray<br>
absorbing agent, antioxidant, anti sticking agent or anti blocking agent can<br>
be voluntarily added.<br>
As a substrate to be used in the thermally sensitive recording medium<br>
of the present invention, paper, recycled paper, synthetic paper, film,<br>
plastic film, plastic foam film or non-woven cloth and a composite sheet<br>
which is prepared by combining these substrates can be used.<br>
The thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention,<br>
for the purpose to improve color developing sensitivity, various public<br>
known techniques in the field of the thermally sensitive recording medium<br>
can be added suitably, for example, to carry out a smoothness treatment<br>
such as a super calendar treatment after coating process of each layer,<br>
further, can provide a back coating layer on the opposite side of the<br>
substrate to which the thermally sensitive recording is provided, for the<br>
purpose to correct the curling of the sheet. Furthermore, an intermediate<br>
layer can be suitably formed between thermally sensitive layer and<br>
protecting layer.<br>
The thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention<br>
can  obtain   good  color  developing  sensitivity  and  recorded image  by<br><br><br>
18<br>
containing a pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more in any layers formed<br>
on a substrate, especially, better color developing sensitivity and recorded<br>
image can be obtained by containing it in the outermost layer, further,<br>
effect of lustrous feature at printing can be performed. In particular, since<br>
blending ratio of the pigment whose aspect ratio is 30 or more can increase<br>
in the protecting layer compared with the blending ratio of the thermally<br>
sensitive recording layer, the best effect can be obtained by containing it in<br>
the protecting layer.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
The thermally sensitive recording medium of the present invention<br>
will be illustrated more actually according to the Examples.<br>
In Examples and Comparative Examples, to one surface of a substrate an<br>
under layer and a thermally sensitive color developping layer are formed<br>
and a protecting layer is formed if a need is arisen. To another surface of<br>
the substrate, a back layer is formed.<br>

pigment are summarized in Table 1, and functions of Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples are summarized in Table 1. And the specific<br>
method for measuring and evaluation of the characteristics of pigments<br>
and thermally sensitive recording medium are illustrated below.<br>
[Average diameter]<br>
Pigment is photographed by an electric microscope and 100 particles are<br>
picked up at random, and length of X axis direction, Y axis direction and Z<br>
axis direction of the particles are measured, and calculate the diameter of<br>
each particle by averaging the longest axis and second longest axis, and the<br>
average value is obtained.<br>
[Aspect ratio]<br>
100 particles are picked up at random, and ratio of diameter and length<br>
(thickness) of shortest axis is calculated (formula mentioned below) and an<br>
average value is obtained.<br>
Aspect ratio=diameter/thickness<br>
