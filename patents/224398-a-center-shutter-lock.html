A CENTER SHUTTER LOCK<br>
JOSHI PRABHAKAR ANANT,<br>
an Indian National of J-61, M.I.D.C, Bhosari, Pune 411 026, Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
1110/MUM/2004	 8 APR Z008<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to a rolling shutters.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to a lock of a rolling shutter.<br>
Description of prior art:<br>
Center Shutter lock is fixed in the center portion of the Rolling Shutter. For, extra wide rolling shutter two extra locks are fitted . The main function of the center lock of the Shutter panel is to prevent it from being opened forcibly using a crowbar Jack or jemmy.<br>
Generally, two padlocks are fitted on two sides of rolling shutters. These locks stop the side locking bolts from sliding inwards and prevent lifting of door panel upwards.<br>
Center shutter locks, which are presently manufactured are of poor design and are very fragile and weak. They easily break open when brute force is applied to open the door. The design and manufacturing of the prior art center shutter locks have following faults and weaknesses: -<br>
1)	Breaking load is very low (about 1000 Kg) and breaking load test is not<br>
done. So, the breaking load is not specified on the lock.<br>
2)	Locking bolts appear to be very strong from outside but the lock<br>
mechanism from inside is very weak and poorly manufactured.<br><br><br>
3)	Height of lock case is 32 to 45 mm. Hence overhang is more when breaking load is applied, even though lock looks bigger, they are very weak.<br>
4)	4 screws of small diameter without any supporting bush are used for fixing inside the lock case . Hence these weak screws are not able to withstand heavy breaking load.<br>
5)	Receptacle of the lock is very weak and it has no sole plate. The side walls are parallel &amp; have no taper. So the receptacle easily comes out when force is applied on the lock.<br>
6)	Sheet thicknenss of the receptacle is less only 1mm to 2mm. Hence the receptacle is structurally weak.<br>
7)	Lock is of lever type or pin-tumbler type. Hence it is less secure as duplicate keys can be easily made.<br>
8)	Lock case is made of sheet metal folded on all 4 sides. Hence it is structurally weak &amp; unable to bear heavy breaking load .<br>
9)	Protection box is not provided at the bottom of lock case to protect locking bolts from attack using hacksaw or crowbar. The locking bolts are also exposed when locked.<br><br>
10)	The receptacle is not provided with 2 Anchor bolts. Hence breaking strength is reduced.<br>
11)	The Side walls of receptacle are vertically parallel. There is no taper on side walls. Hence the receptacle easily lifts up under heavy breaking load .<br>
Primary aim of this invention is to make an improved center lock in which all above listed defects &amp; weaknesses are eliminated and the customer is presented with an ultra safe center lock , resisting breaking loads of even 5 Tons.<br><br><br>
Summary of invention:<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
Referring to the drawings, the two locking bolts (05, 06) are given rotary motion by the lock (which has lock spring (35) inside) and key assembly through two links (08). In addition to the two top dead bolt spacers (03) &amp; (04), one more dead bolt spacer (07) is also provided. When key (33) with key ring (34) is turned, the disc (13) rotates and pushes the two links (08) onwards, which are connected at the other end to the locking bolts (05, 06), therefore the locking bolts rotate outwards and locking takes place as the two locking bolts interlock with the top surface of the receptacle (11) and prevent the door from lifting upwards. Pressure pins (37, 38, 39 &amp; 40) are provided to ensure that the key remains intact inside the lock. A Pin (55) for two locators 19 &amp; 19(a) on the front and back plate is provided. Also top and side locking pins (42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48) are provided for the key. The lock has a sealing cover (64) &amp; (60) and top sealing cover (66) for inside housing.<br>
To unlock the lock the key is rotated in the reverse direction, disc (13) rotates in opposite direction and pulls the two links (08) inwards which in turn pull the locking bolts inwards (which rotate in opposite direction). In retracted<br><br><br>
position the two locking bolts come out of the receptacle when the door of rolling shutter is lifted upwards.<br>
In figure 7, the disc (13) is rotating 6Â° beyond the horizontal axis, whereby it prevents the lock from opening as the toggle action of the disc (13) and link (08) prevents the locking bolts (05 &amp; 06) from rotating inwards hence even if force us applied externally on the locking bolts (05 &amp; 06) lock will not open thereby the shutter door will remain locked and secure. Figure 11 shows the dust cover (09) with rivet (59).<br>
Unique design features are incorporated in the lock assembly to increase the breaking load of the locking bolts to more than 5 tons.<br>
Following design feature are incorporated in the lock assembly to increase the breaking load of the lock to more than 5 tons. Refer Figure 7.<br>
1.	Bent sides of lock case (01) on top (a), left (b) and right (c) side engage with the top slots (d) and left slot E and right slot F respectively. These bent edges of the lock case support the cover plate (02) and prevent it from slipping out.<br>
2.	4 spacer sleeves (22) are riveted to the cover plate (02). They enter the hole 22(a) &amp; 22(b) of the cover plate and form a firm bond between cover plate and lock case. This assembly prevents the lock case and cover plate from separating when breaking force is applied on lock.<br>
3.	4 threaded rivets (20) (with apertures 20A &amp; 20B in front and back plate) are having tapped holes on tip side. 4 screws are screwed to fix<br><br><br>
the cover plate (02) on lock case (01). These 4 screws give strength to the lock assembly and prevent the lock from opening.<br>
4.	2 dead bolt rivets (15) and 2 flat rivets (17) enter the holes (15) and holes (17) of the cover plate (02) these 4 rivets gives supports to the cover plate (02) and prevent the lock from opening. Two apertures 17(a) &amp; 17(b) for flat rivet are provided on the front plate. A double dead bolt rivet (41) is also provided with the lock.<br>
5.	Bent edge 01 rests against the bent edge 02(a) of cover plate (02) and the prevents disassembly of lock case (01) and cover plate (02). This gives added strength to the lock assembly, prevent the lock from opening.<br>
6.	Hard bush (51) enters the plate 51(a) of the cover plate (02) and supports the cover plate from slipping out when force is applied to break upon the lock. All the above design features no. 1 to no. 6 combined provides strength to the lock and prevent the lock from opening even if breaking force of 5 tons are applied on the shutter.<br>
The detailed function of various parts is as follows:<br>

All these 4 no dead bolt pieces are assembled together with 6 nos. rivets. The rivets diameters, which are selected, are designed to help the lock to take load more than 5 tons. A Circlip (53) is also provided for dead bolt. A spacer rivet (27) with apertures 27(a) &amp; 27(b) is provided for dead bolt in front and back plate. A profile (17c) is formed in deadbolt, which allows free swinging of deadbolts and also limits the movements. The complete dead bolt assembly is Ni Cr plated which is strongly rust proof as the environmental conditions will not affect or limit the use of lock. Two dead bolt springs L.H. and R.H. (49 &amp; 50) are also provided for the dead bolt.<br>
b)	Disc Assembly 13(a):<br>
Disc assembly has roller (56) for the disc. This assembly is used for operating the lock from inside and outside. The profile is so designed that it guides itself in the profile of lock case and also limits its rotation. The other part of assembly is a disc rivet (21), which will not allow the dead bolt to move in reverse direction after<br><br><br>
locking. The plate for rivet is used to move the disc, and in turn the dead bolts which function from inside. The profile of plate is so designed that it allows a point contact between crank (14) and plate from both sides. Complete disc assembly is Ni - Cr plated to avoid rusting.<br>
4.	Link - part no 08:<br>
2 Links are used to connect dead bolts with disc assembly. Links are riveted (16) in dead bolt (36) and disc by keeping minimum clearance for its free rotation. The dead bolts both L.H. &amp; R.H. (05) &amp; (06) are pivoted in the two lock case rivets (15, 15(A), 15(B)), which are riveted in the lock case and also to guide the dead bolts while swinging. Two or other rivets ( 17) are riveted in lock case.<br>
5.	Mounting plate- part no 10:<br>
This plate is used to locate inside and outside lock assembles in the lock. The plate is riveted (67) after fitting the lock assemblies in the lock. An aperture 67(b) is provided for mounting plate rivet R.H. The plate is riveted after fitting the lock assembly on two lock case rivets (54 &amp; 71). An aperture 54(b) &amp; 71(b) is also provided for mounting plate rivet (54).<br>
6.	Lock assembly:<br>
