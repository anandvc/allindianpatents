				<td>FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a process for making a laundry detergent bar composition containing phosphate materials.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are not common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable in-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel; which have low smear; which have the appropriate level of sudsing; which are mild to the skin; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance.<br>
Methods for making such laundry detergent bars are also well known in the art. It is known in the art to use or make a structuring system In the process for making a bar, so that the resultant bar has appropriate physical properties. A common material used for such structuring system includes siliceous materials, such as aluminosilicate, silica, silicates, and clays.<br>
There is a continuing need to find alternative methods for making laundry bar compositions with Improved physical properties, In addition,<br>
there is a continuing need to find such bar process methods which are less expensive, so that consumers can enjoy better value for their purchases. It has now been found that an improved process for making laundry bar compositions containing phosphate materials and divalent metals results in bars having better physical properties, better cleaning performance, as well as improved mildness properties. None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for making a synthetic laundry detergent bar composition having the steps of providing a neutralized synthetic detergent active; adding a divalent metal compound to the neutralized active, wherein the divalent metal compound is selected from the group consisting of divalent metal oxides, chlorides, hydroxides, and mixtures thereof;<br>
and optionally, adding other optional components, and forming into bars;<br><br>
wherein the bar composition is substantially free of siliceous materials, and wherein the bar composition further comprises phosphate materials.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While this specification concludes with claims distinctly pointing out and particularly claiming that which is regarded as the invention, it is believed that the invention can be better understood through a careful reading of the following detailed description of the invention. In this specification, all percentages, ratios, and proportions are by weight, all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius, molecular weights are in weight average, and the decimal is represented by the point (.), unless otherwise indicated.<br>
As used herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of" and "consisting essentially of".<br>
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention,<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for making a synthetic laundry detergent bar composition having the steps of providing a neutralized detergent active; adding a divalent metal compound to the neutralized active, wherein the divalent metal compound is selected from the group consisting of divalent metal oxides, chlorides, hydroxides, and mixtures thereof; and optionally, adding other optional components, and forming into bars; wherein the bar composition is substantially free of siliceous materials, and wherein the bar composition further comprises phosphate materials.<br>
The laundry detergent bars produced by the process of the present invention have improved physical properties. Improved physical properties include but are not limited to the following: appropriate bar hardness, reduced smearing, reduced mushiness, and improved overall appearance of the bar when both wet and dry. In one particular instance, a bar when is exposed to the wash water forms a creamy layer on the outside of the bar, so that when the consumer uses the bar, it is smooth to the hands. Although the bar is substantially free of siliceous materials, the bars made by the process of the present invention have good physical properties. By using divalent metal compounds and phosphate materials and not siliceous materials in the process of the present invention, the bar formulation cost is decreased while still retaining good bar physical properties,<br>
Process<br>
The preferred process of the present invention is described below. The detergent bars can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some of all of the following key equipment:blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a preferred process, the raw materials are mixed in the blender. An acid surfactant, such as alkyl benzene sulfonic acid, is reacted with alkaline inorganic salts to complete neutralization, the amount of alkaline inorganic salt being at least sufficient to completely neutralize the acid. In an alternate process, neutralized surfactant is added in the blender. The divalent metal compound is added to a neutralized detergent active. The detergent active should be substantially neutralized so that any reaction between the divalent metal compound and detergent active can be minimized, or preferably, eliminated. Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it is believed that if the acid detergent active and divalent metal compound react, the resultant salt does not act as a surfactant, but instead acts to depress the cleaning and sudsing performance of the bar Composition.<br>
The phosphate material is also added to the mixer. If using an acid form of detergent active, substantially all of the phosphate material is preferably added before neutralization of the detergent active Is substantially completed, and the divalent metal is added after neutralization, it is also acceptable to add part of the phosphate material before and part after the neutralization of the detergent active. If starting with an already neutralized detergent active, the phosphate material can be added at the same time, or after the addition of the divalent metal compound.<br>
In another variation of the process the divalent metal compound can be premixed with the phosphate material and then added to the neutralized detergent active. Similarly, it is also possible to add the divalent metal compound in the form of a slurry or suspension, instead of adding it in a powder, or dry form.<br>
Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it is believed that the phosphate material and the divalent metal compound forms a complex which acts as a structurant in the bar matrix and therefore, Improves the physical properties of the resultant bar composition.<br>
Other optional components are then added to the mixture. Some of the optional components may be present in the mixture when the surfactant, divalent metal compound, and/or the phosphate material is added to the mixture. The composition is substantially free of siliceous materials. The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multiworm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air/gas is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage,<br>
Another preferred laundry bar composition is made by the following method; The raw materials are first mixed In a blender. Sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized CFAS is mixed for about 1-2 minutes, in order to make a mixed anlonlc LAS/Alkyl Sulfate surfactant bar composition. This is followed by the addition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid (if present in the formulation). The acids are then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (The amount of sodium carbonate should be at least an amount sufficient to neutralize the acids,) Sodium trlpolyphosphate is added before the acids are completely neutralized. The materials are mixed for an additional 1-2 minutes after dosing. Once the neutralization reaction is completed, a chelant, If present<br>
is added, followed by calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide and other optional surfactants, and any other additional optional components, The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about five to ten minutes. As one of the last ingredients, bleach and enzymes are added to the mixture and then mixed for an additional one to five minutes. The composition is substantially free of siliceous materials. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar can be cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage.<br>

Modified polyethylene!mine polymers may also be included herein. These modified polyethyleneimine polymers comprise backbones that can be either linear or cyclic. The polyamine backbones can also comprise polyamine branching chains to a greater or lesser degree. In general, the polyamine backbones described herein are modified in such a manner that each nitrogen of the polyamine chain is thereafter described in terms of a unit that is substituted, quaternized, oxidized, or combinations thereof.<br>
Preferred modified pofyethyleneimine polymers are generally polyalkyleneaminss (PAA's), polyalkyleneimines (PAI's), preferably polyethyleneamine (PEA's), polyethyleneimines (PEI's), or PEA's or PEI's connected by moieties having longer R units than the parent PAA's, PAI's, PEA's or PEI's. A common polyalkyleneamine (PAA) is tetrabutylenepentamine. PEA's are obtained by reactions involving ammonia and ethylene dichloride, followed by fractional distillation. The common PEA's obtained are triethylenetetramine (TETA) and teraethylenepentamine (TEPA). Above the pentamines, i.e., the hexamines. heptamines, octarnines and possibly nonamines, the cogenerically derived mixture does not appear to separate by distillation and can include other materials such as cyclic amines and particularly piperazines. There can also be present cyclic amines with side chains in which nitrogen atoms appear. See U.S.<br>
Patent 2,792,372,  Dickinson,  issued May 14,  1957,  which describes the preparation of PEA's.<br>
Preferred amine polymer backbones comprise R units that are C2 alkylene (ethylene) units, also known as polyethyleneimines (PEI's), Preferred PEI's have at least moderate branching, that is the ratio of m to n is less than 4:1, however PEI's having a ratio of m to n of about 2:1 are most preferred. Preferred backbones, prior to modification have the general formula:<br>
wherein m and n are the same as defined herein above. Preferred PEI's, prior to modification, will have a molecular weight greater than about 200 Daltons.<br>
The polyamine soil release agents of the present invention if included in the detergent composition, is included from about 0.01% to about 5%; preferably about 0.3% to about 4%; more preferably about 0.5% to about 2.5%, by weight of the detergent composition. Moisture<br>
The final bar composition should have no more than about 15% moisture. The moisture level of the total bar composition can be determined by any methods known in the art by one skilled in the area of laundry bar compositions. One common method is the Bldwell Sterling Distillation method; Another known method is the Karl Fischer Moisture Titration Method. See AOCS official method Dd2a-59 issue 93 and AOCS official method Dd2b-59 issue 89. Bar Physical Properties<br>
The bars of the present invention have improved physical properties, including improved in-process and aged hardness of the bar as well as reduced solubility in water during washing. In addition, the bars of the present invention have improved cleaning benefits as well as mildness benefits.<br>
he bars of the present invention are sufficiently hard. A preferred test method measures bar hardness after three weeks of aging. Bars are aged for three weeks at 80°F/80 relative humidity (RH). To measure the bar hardness, a needle with a point angle of 43° attached to a force gauge (Control International, Lincolnwood, IL, USA) was forced onto the plane of the bar surface to a depth of 5.8 mm. A preferred bar hardness reading of laundry bar compositions using this test method is about 55-70 Ibs. Bars of the present invention fall within the range. Another method to measure bar hardness is to measure the penetration of a needle through the bar surface under a standard weight for 5 seconds using a cone penetrometer. One such penetrometer is made by Associated Instrument Manufacturers India Pvt. Ltd. (Model number AIM 512). The weight of the rod and the cone is 149 grams and an additional 50 gram weight is placed on the cone. The penetration reading of a fresh bar made as per the present invention will typically be about 20-30 (1/10 mm) and 15-20 (1/10 mm) after 40 minutes. Bars aged about 3 days at ambient conditions will typically have a bar penetration reading of about 5-12 (1/10 mm).<br>
Another physical property of interest is the bar solubility in water. One method of determining the bar solubility is to submerge a bar having the following dimensions 75mm x 55mm in 250 ml of water in a beaker for 2 hours, drying the bar at 60 deg. C for 2 hours and then weighing the bar. To have acceptable bar solubility, the difference in weight should be about 5-20 grams for a 125 gram bar (12-16% of the original weight of the bar), more preferably 5-15 grams (4-12% of the original weight of the bar).<br>
According to the present invention is provided a process for making a synthetic laundry detergent bar composition comprising the steps of characterized in that:<br>
a.	providing a neutralized synthetic detergent active such as herin<br>
described;<br>
b.	adding a divalent metal compound to the neutralized active, wherein<br>
the divalent metal compound is selected from the group consisting of<br>
divalent metal oxides, chlorides, hydroxides, and mixtures thereof; and<br>
optionally, adding other optional detergent adjunct components, and<br>
c.	forming into bars;<br>
wherein the bar composition is substantially free of siliceous materials, and wherein the bar composition comprises phosphate materials.<br>
The following examples further describe and demonstrate the preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for the purpose of illustrations, and are not to be construed as limitations of the present invention since many variations thereof are possible without departing from its spirit and scope.<br>
Example 1<br>
In order to make 100 kg of finished product/ about 6 kg dry flakes of neutralized NaCFAS (sodium salt of coconut fatty alcohol sulfate), 4 kg of sodium carbonate, 18 kg of sodium tripolyphosphate and 50 kg of sodium sulfate are added to the mixer. The mixer used is a ploughshear kind of mixer (trade name: KM Mixer by Littleford Inc.). The KM Mixer main shaft rpm is adjusted to 130. Hot oil at 60°C is circulated around the jacket of the mixer to minimize any heat loss during the process. The powders added are at ambient temperature. The mixer is started and at the same time, about 11 kg of the neutralized NaCFAS paste is added to the mixer. The paste temperature is in the range of 55-60°C. The mixture is mixed for about 3 minutes. Then, about 7 kg of LAS (linear alkyl benzene suifonate acid and 2.5 kg of sulfuric acid are added to the batch. The mixture is further mixed for about 3 minutes. This is followed by the'addition of 1 kg of C12 coco fatty alcohol, 40 kg of calcium carbonate, and 3 kg of calcium hydroxide. The mixture is mixed for about a minute. This is followed by the addition of optional components such as brighteners, anti-redeposition agents, soil release polymers, etc. After the mixture is further mixed, enzymes are added to the batch and mixed for about 30 additional minutes. The final form of the batch is lumpy. The temperature of the batch at the end of the mixing cycle is about 65-70°C. The mixture is then dropped into a surge tank which continuously feeds to a refiner plodder. The output of the refiner plodder is a detergent mass in the form of noodles which are then fed to a duplex vacuum plodder. A vacuum of about -0.9bar(670mm of Hg) is maintained to remove any entrapped error in the detergent matrix. The bar coming out of the final stage of the duplex vacuum plodder is at 55-60°C, This bar is cooled to about 50°C and then packed into polyethylene wrappers.<br>
Various bar compositions (Examples 2 through 4) are prepared by the process of the invention. Examples 2 through 4 have improved physical properties, including acceptable bar hardness, and reduced smearing,<br>
(Tabl e Removed) <br><br><br>
