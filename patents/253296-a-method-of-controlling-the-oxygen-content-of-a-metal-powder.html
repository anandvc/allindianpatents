				<td>The present disclosure relates to a method of reducing the oxygen content of a<br>
powder, for example a metallic powder, in a controlled manner, the powder being<br>
located in an enclosed canister. The present disclosure also relates the manufacturing<br>
of dense bodies and to a dense product produced by the method. Especially it relates<br>
to a method of reducing the oxygen content of metallic powders having high<br>
chromium content and low carbon content.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART<br>
When producing powders, especially metallic powders, there is often an unintentional<br>
oxidation of the surfaces of the powders during production. Furthermore, oxygen<br>
might be present inside the powder itself, either in solution or as oxide particles. In<br>
this latter case the oxygen is usually generated during the melting process due to<br>
equilibrium with the dross and the lining of the furnace.<br>
The oxides, especially the oxides of the powder surfaces, might lead to deteriorated<br>
mechanical properties of a component produced to near-net-shape (NNS) of a powder<br>
by densification. In the case of surface oxides, a network of oxide inclusions will form<br>
where the surfaces of the powder were located before densification.<br>
One example of a powder that suffers from the above stated problems is powder of<br>
super duplex stainless steels (SDSS). Dense bodies of SDSS can be used in various<br>
different environments. One application is in the oil and gas industry. However, dense<br>
bodies of SDSS produced by powder metallurgy generally suffer from low impact<br>
strength. One theory of the reason for this problem is that intermetallics precipitate at<br>
oxide inclusions. Another theory is that intermetallics and oxide precipitates both<br>
decrease the impact strength, however separately. In either case, there is a need of<br>
reduced oxygen content of the powder.<br>
However, even other powder materials, such as metallic powders or hard materials,<br>
might have a too high content of oxygen to achieve good mechanical strength, such as<br><br>
impact strength, after compacted to a dense body. This is especially important for<br>
materials that easily oxidise during powder formation even if precautionary<br>
measurements have been taken.<br>
It is previously known to utilise a getter to minimise the oxygen content when<br>
producing dense products by powder metallurgy technique. For example, US<br>
3,992,200 discloses the use of a getter consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf and mixtures thereof to<br>
prevent oxide formation in the final compacted article. This method is for example<br>
utilised on high-speed steels and superalloys. Furthermore, US 6,328,927 discloses<br>
the use of a getter when manufacturing dense bodies of tungsten. In this case the<br>
powder capsule is made of the getter material, such as titanium or alloys thereof.<br>
However, merely utilising a getter material does not sufficiently reduce the oxygen<br>
content to the desired low levels of all powders, especially of all powders of steels.<br>
This is especially difficult in powders wherein the carbon content is low, such as 
%. The time for reduction, and hence the result, is difficult to accomplish in a<br>
controlled manner and in a cost-effective way.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for a method of reducing the oxygen content of a<br>
powder in a controlled manner before densification, especially for low oxygen<br>
contents.<br>
Also, there is a need for reducing the oxygen, content of low carbon steels, having a<br>
high Cr content, to very low levels, such as less than 100 ppm.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method of reducing the oxygen content of a powder is provided. A canister is<br>
prepared with a getter, filled with the powder to be densified, evacuated and sealed.<br>
The canister is subjected to a hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 900-1200 °C,<br>
which results in a diffusion of hydrogen into the canister through the walls thereof.<br>
The hydrogen forms moisture when reacted with the oxygen of the powder and the<br>
moisture in then reacted with the getter in order to remove oxygen from the powder to<br><br>
the getter. The atmosphere outside the canister is then altered to an inert atmosphere<br>
or vacuum, whereby hydrogen diffuses out of the canister.<br>
The powder having a reduced oxygen content can thereafter be subjected to<br>
conventional near-net-shaping powder metallurgy technologies, such as Hot Isostatic<br>
Pressure (HIP) or Cold Isostatic Pressure (CEP), whereby a dense product having a<br>
controlled content of oxide inclusions is accomplished.<br>
BREIF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the oxygen content profile of a densified body of stainless steel.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The problems stated above have now been solved by a new method utilising selective<br>
hydrogen diffusion through the walls of the canister in combination with a getter to<br>
achieve a controlled reduction of oxygen inside an enclosed canister.<br>
Firstly, a canister, preferably of a mild steel, is provided with a getter material. The<br>
getter material can be introduced into the canister for example by providing the<br>
canister walls with a thin foil of the getter material. However, any method of<br>
introduction of the getter material into the canister may be utilised, such as for<br>
example forming the canister of the getter material. The getter is preferably selected<br>
from the group of Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, REM or an alloy or compound based on any of these<br>
elements. More preferably, the getter is Ti or Zr. It is important that the getter has<br>
such a high melting temperature that it does not melt during the procedure and that it<br>
is distributed so that the distance for diffusion to the getter is not too long. Preferably,<br>
the getter is distributed along at least the longest wall of the canister, more preferably<br>
the getter is distributed along all of the canister walls.<br>
In some cases it might be desirable to produce a dense body wherein different parts of<br>
the body have different properties. In such a case, the getter is naturally placed in the<br>
canister at locations where a lower oxygen content of the final product is desired. This<br><br>
might for example be applicable when producing larger dense bodies, since the<br>
distance of diffusion to the getter might be very long.<br>
Thereafter, the canister is filled with a powder. This is the powder, which should be<br>
reduced in oxygen content and thereafter densified to near-net-shape (NNS) by<br>
conventional powder metallurgy techniques, such as HIP or OP. The canister is<br>
thereafter evacuated and sealed according to conventional procedure.<br>
The canister is heated up to a temperature of 900-1200 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere.<br>
Preferably the canister is heated up to a temperature of 1000-1150 °C. By subjecting<br>
the canister to this heat treatment, hydrogen is allowed to diffuse into the canister<br>
through the walls thereof. Preferably, the heating is performed at a rate of 0.5-5<br>
°C/min, more preferred at a rate of 1-3 °C/min. Both the heating rate and the<br>
temperature are preferably adjusted to the powder material and naturally also the<br>
desired result. The hydrogen will diffuse into the canister until the hydrogen partial<br>
pressure on both sides of the walls of the canister has been substantially equilibrated,<br>
which means approximately 1 bar inside the canister. Hydrogen and oxide of the<br>
powder will react and thereby establishing a moisture partial pressure inside the<br>
canister.<br>
The reduction of oxygen is performed by the moisture inside the canister reacting with<br>
the getter material according to the following formula:<br><br>
wherein M is the getter material or the active part thereof. Thereby, oxygen is<br>
transferred from the powder bulk to the getter.<br>
Reduction of the oxygen content of the powder may be performed during the heating<br>
process. However, it can also be performed during a holding time at a constant<br>
temperature or a stepwise increasing temperature using a holding time at each<br>
temperature step.<br>
The time for oxygen reduction with aid of the heat treatment described above is<br>
adjusted to the powder material, the size of the canister, i.e. the amount of powder,<br><br>
and the oxygen level to be achieved. Furthermore, the time may in some cases<br>
preferably be adapted to the selected getter material. Preferably, in the cases wherein<br>
holding times are used, the total time for reduction is at least one hour, more<br>
preferably 3-15 hours, and most preferably 5-10 hours. However, the total reduction<br>
time must be adapted to temperature as well as the size of the canister, i.e. the<br>
maximum distance of diffusion of oxygen and/or moisture to the getter.<br>
After the reduction of oxygen is performed, the environment outside the canister is<br>
altered to an inert atmosphere or vacuum. Preferably, the inert atmosphere is<br>
accomplished by flowing gas, such as Ar or N2. The hydrogen will as a result of the<br>
altered environment diffuse out of the canister trough the walls thereof in order to<br>
establish substantially a state of equilibrium between the inside and the outside of the<br>
canister, i.e. the partial pressure of hydrogen inside the canister is approximately zero.<br>
The canister is after the diffusion of hydrogen in and out of the canister optionally<br>
allowed to cool down to room temperature. Preferably, this cooling procedure is slow.<br>
It may be performed at the same time as the canister is subjected to the inert<br>
atmosphere in order to diffuse hydrogen out of the canister. However, according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the densifying process, such as for example<br>
HIP, is performed while the canister is still hot, i.e. the densifying process is<br>
performed directly after the diffusion of hydrogen in and out of the canister.<br>
The powder is then ready to be densified by conventional powder metallurgy<br>
techniques, such as HIP or CIP, to a near net shape. Additionally, the above-described<br>
method can also be used when attaching densified powders to a substrate.<br>
Parameters that are considered to influence the result of the above-described method<br>
are time to fill the canister with hydrogen, temperature and time for the reduction of<br>
oxygen and time to evacuate hydrogen from the canister after the reduction. Naturally,<br>
all parameters must be adjusted to the composition of the powder material and the<br>
result to be achieved.<br>
The time to fill the canister is naturally affected by the thickness of the canister walls<br>
as well as temperature. In some cases it might be applicable to provide a canister that<br><br>
has some parts of the walls that facilitates the diffusion of hydrogen as well. This can<br>
be accomplished for example by providing thinner canister walls at those parts or<br>
select a different material with a higher diffusivity of hydrogen for those parts of the<br>
canister walls. On the other way around, some parts of the walls might need to be<br>
thicker in order to resist dimensional distortion due to thermal softening.<br>
By utilisation of the method, the oxygen level of the powder can be reduced in a<br>
controlled manner at least to levels below 100 ppm. This results in that a dense body<br>
can be manufactured, which has good mechanical properties, especially good impact<br>
strength and a low ductile-to-brittle-temperature.<br>
One advantage of the method described above is that the presence of hydrogen gas<br>
inside the canister increases the heating rate compared to if it would be a vacuum<br>
inside the canister. This is due to that the hydrogen conducts heat better than a<br>
vacuum does. Another advantage of the method is that the nitrogen content of the<br>
powder after the oxygen reduction is substantially the same as in the originally<br>
provided powder. Consequently, the method is advantageously used on powders<br>
wherein the nitrogen content is important for the properties.<br>
Moreover, another advantage is that the method enables the use of powders, which<br>
would not be able to use before due to too high oxygen content For example, powders<br>
produced by water-atomisation can be used for production of dense products instead<br>
of more expensive inert gas atomised powders, while still achieving good properties.<br>
Consequently, cheaper materials can be used resulting in a more cost-effective final<br>
dense product.<br>
Furthermore, a person skilled in the art realises that the method described above also<br>
generates a bonus effect since oxidation of the canister walls is inhibited, especially<br>
the outside of the canister walls. Thereby, the risk for the canister to leak during for<br>
example a subsequent HIP process is minimised. Furthermore, the risk for damage or<br>
wear out of certain furnaces, such as graphite or Mo furnaces, due to oxides on the<br>
canisters is reduced.<br><br>
The method according to the present disclosure is particularly developed to be used<br>
for powder materials of stainless steels, especially super duplex stainless steels<br>
(SSDS) and 316L. However, it is also possible to utilise this method on other powder<br>
materials when the content of oxygen has to be reduced and also when producing hard<br>
materials.<br>
Optionally, the reduction of oxygen inside the canister can further be promoted by the<br>
usage of additional reducing agents above the hydrogen. Such reducing agents are<br>
preferably carbon based. The carbon might be introduced by for example providing a<br>
carbon surface on the powder, mixing graphite with the powder or even utilising the<br>
carbon content of the powder itself. In this case it is important that the getter also may<br>
reduce the carbon content. Therefore, suitable materials as getters are in this case Ti,<br>
Zr or Ta.<br>
The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with the aid of some<br>
illustrative examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Two powders produced by nitrogen-gas atonisation were tested. The composition of<br>
the powders are listed in Table 1, all in weight percent except oxygen which is in parts<br>
per million.<br><br>
2-mm mild steel canisters with a dimension of 92x26x150 mm were utilised. The<br>
interior of the 92x150 mm walls of the canisters were attached with 0.125 mm metal<br>
foils of Ti by spot-welding.<br><br>
All canisters were filled with powder, evacuated and sealed according to standard<br>
procedure. Canisters with Ti-foil getter were treated according to the method<br>
described above. First, the heating was carried out rapidly up to 500 °C, subsequently<br>
at a rate of 5 °C/min up to a, in advance, chosen reduction temperature with a holding<br>
time of 60 minutes. Thereafter, the temperature was set to 900 °C and the environment<br>
outside the canisters was changed from hydrogen to argon. After 1 hour, the furnace<br>
heating was switched off and the canisters were allowed to cool down to room<br>
temperature inside the furnace. Subsequently, the powders were subjected to HIP.<br>
Table 2 illustrates the different compositions of metallic powder of the canisters and<br>
the parameters for which the canisters were subjected.<br>
Slices with a thickness of 3 mm were cut out in the middle of the canisters through the<br>
small cross section (92x26 before HIP) and samples for chemical analysis were cut<br>
out from these slices. The foil-attached walls were not included in the samples. The<br>
results are also presented in Table 2, wherein the oxygen values represent the median<br>
of double samples, except for triple samples for Canister A.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Two large canisters of 2 mm mild steel plate were produced with a diameter of 133<br>
mm and a height of 206 mm. In this case, a 0.125 mm thick titanium foil and a 0.025<br><br>
mm zirconium foil were attached to the inside of the envelope walls, respectively. The<br>
canisters were filled with Alloy 1 of Table 1, evacuated and sealed according to<br>
standard procedure. The canisters were subjected to the method described above with<br>
the following parameters: heating at 1.4 °C/min in hydrogen up to 1100 °C; holding at<br>
1100 °C during 9 hours; changing to argon flow and slow cooling down to room<br>
temperature (The cooling rate was 1.3-1.7 °C/min down to 700 °C). Thereafter, HIP<br>
was performed at 1150 °C and 100 MPa during 3 hours.<br>
Slices of 5 mm were cut out from the densified canisters approximately 4 cm from the<br>
top. Thereafter, eight double samples were cut out in the radial direction from the<br>
surface to the centre of the slices. The results, for the canister with Zr getter, are<br>
presented in Table 3 and the results, for the canister with Ti getter, are presented in<br>
Table 4. Sample 1 is closest to the surface and consequently, sample 8 is the centre.<br>
Furthermore, the oxygen distribution is shown in Figure 1, wherein the dotted line<br>
illustrates the oxygen content of the powder before utilising the method.<br><br>
Apparently, the use of different getters results different oxygen distributions and<br>
overall oxygen reduction after the selective hydrogen diffusion procedure. Zr<br>
performed better than titanium with regard to overall oxygen reduction. However,<br>
there is an increase of oxygen close to the surface and in vicinity to the getter. This is<br>
believed to be a result of the surface attaining a lower temperature than the core<br><br>
during cooling, whereby a shift from reducing to oxidative condition appear in the<br>
cold regions.<br>
Furthermore, the nitrogen content of the samples was analysed. The nitrogen loss was<br>
rather low and the Zr getter performed slightly better than the Ti getter. This is a result<br>
of the thin Zr-foil becoming saturated with nitrogen while continuating to reduce the<br>
oxygen content, i.e. act as a getter material.<br>
Example 3<br>
The impact strength of the different specimens from Examples 1 and 2 was tested<br>
along with two comparative specimens where the method was not executed.<br>
Specimens of 10x10x55 were cut out from the produced test materials. From the<br>
canister of Example 2 with Zr-foil, specimens were cut out in the radial region having<br>
approximately zero ppm oxygen.<br>
The specimens of Alloy 2 were annealed at 1050 °C for 60 minutes and then quenched<br>
in water. Specimens of Alloy 1 were annealed at 1080 °C for 60 minutes. Some of<br>
these specimens were quenched in water and others were cooled with controlled rate<br>
of 1-2.3 °C/second through the temperature interval 900-700 °C.<br>
Notch cutting and Charpy notch impact test was performed. For the specimens of<br>
Alloy 2 the temperature of the impact tests was -196 °C and the temperature for Alloy<br>
1 was -50 °C. The results are presented in Table 5, wherein the Charpy notch impact<br>
energy is presented as an average of two specimens and Q stands for quenching and<br>
CCT stands for controlled cooling rate.<br>
Clearly, Alloy 1 shows a transition from ductile to brittle at increasing oxygen<br>
content, similar to a transition with regard to temperature. The transition for quenched<br>
Alloy 1 is within the oxygen content interval 100-150 ppm.<br>
The results show that the oxygen content should be reduced down to 100 ppm or less<br>
in order to obtain a ductile behaviour for Alloys 1 and 2.<br><br><br><br>
