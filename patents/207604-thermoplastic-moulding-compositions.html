THE PATENTS ACT,   1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"THERMOPLASTIC MOULDING COMPOSITIONS"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, D*51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic moulding compositions.<br>
The present invention relates to polycarbonate moulding compositions which comprise zinc compounds and have improved mechanical properties and an improved crude shade.<br>
Thermoplastic moulding compositions, in particular those which comprise homo-and/or copolymers of one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers, polycarbonates and polyesters, are known from a large number of publications. This particularly applies to the use of ABS polymers. Reference is made to the following documents merely by way of example: DE-A 19 616, WO97/40092, EP-A 728 811, EP-A 315 868 (= US-A 4 937 285), EP-A 0 174 493 (US-P 4 983 658), US-P 5 030 675, JA 5 920 240, EP-A 0 363 608 (= US-PS 204 394), EP-A 0 767 204, EP-A 0 611 798, WO 96/27600 and EP-A 0 754.<br>
The thermoplastic moulding compositions described in this prior art are still in need of improvement in their mechanical properties. This particularly applies to the use of these moulding compositions in safety-relevant components, e.g. in the motor vehicle industry, where high requirements are imposed on elongation at break, ESC properties and heat distortion point. The crude shade of the known moulding compositions furthermore also requires improvement.<br>
EP-A 761 746 describes moulding compositions which are based on polycarbonate and optionally other thermoplastics and comprise very fine-particled inorganic powders and flameproofing agents. Zinc oxide is mentioned amongst others. 0.1 to 100 nm is mentioned as the average particle diameter.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that polycarbonate moulding compositions have an improved crude shade and improved mechanical properties if zinc compounds of a particular size are added to them. The invention accordingly provides moulding compositions comprising thermoplastic polycarbonate and 0.01 to 30 parts by<br><br>
weight per 100 parts by weight (polycarbonate) of zinc compounds having an average particle diameter of 1 nm to 20 μm, preferably 1 nm to 10 μm.<br>
The invention also provides thermoplastic moulding compositions comprising<br>
A.	40 to 99 parts by wt, preferably 50 to 95 parts by wt., particularly preferably<br>
60 to 90 parts by wt. of an aromatic polycarbonate,<br>
B.	0 to 50, preferably 1 to 40 parts by wt. of a vinyl (copolymer of at least one<br>
monomer chosen from the series consisting of styrene, a-methylstyrene,<br>
•styrenes substituted on the nucleus, CVCg-alkyl methacrylates and C1C8-alkyl acrylates with at least one monomer from the series consisting of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, C1-C8-alkyl methacrylates, C1-C8-alkyl acrylates, maleic anhydride and N-substituted maleimides,<br>
C.	0.5 to 60 parts by wt., preferably 1 to 40 parts by wt., particularly preferably<br>
2 to 30 parts by wt. of a graft copolymer comprising at least two monomers<br>
from the group consisting of mono- or polyunsaturated olefins, such as e.g.<br>
ethylene, propylene, chloroprene, butadiene and isoprene, vinyl acetate,<br>
styrene, a-methylstyrene, styrenes substituted on the nucleus, vinyl cyanides,<br>
such as e.g. acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and N-<br>
substituted maleimides,<br>
D.	0.01 to 30 parts by wt., preferably 0.01 to 20 parts by wt., particularly<br>
preferably 0.01 to 10 parts by wt., especially preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by wt.<br>
of zinc compounds having an average particle diameter of 1 nm to 20 μm,<br>
preferably 1 nm to 10 urn, zinc oxide having average particle diameters of<br>
The moulding compositions according to the invention can furthermore comprise as additives (component E): conventional flameproofing agents, very fine-particled<br><br><br>

and<br>
Z        denotes carbon, with the proviso that on at least one atom Z R9 and R10 simultaneously denote alkyl.<br>

Methyl, ethyl and propyl methacrylate are particularly preferred. Methyl methacrylate is mentioned as a particularly preferred methacrylic acid ester.<br>
Thermoplastic (co)polymers having a composition according to component B can be<br><br>
formed as a by-product during the grafting polymerization for the preparation of component C, especially if large amounts of monomers are grafted on to small amounts of rubber. The amount of (co)polymer B to be employed according to the invention does not include these by-products of the grafting polymerization.<br>
(Co)polymers according to component B are resinous, thermoplastic and rubber-free.<br>
Thermoplastic (co)polymers B comprise 50 to 99, preferably 60 to 95 parts by wt. B.l and 50 to 1, preferably 40 to 5 parts by wt B.2.<br>

preferably have molecular weights Mw (weight-average, determined by light scattering or sedimentation) of between 15,000 and 200,000.<br>
Particularly preferred copolymers B according to the invention are also randomly built-up copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride, which can be prepared from the corresponding monomers by a continuous bulk or solution polymerization with incomplete conversions.<br>

The molecular weights (number-average M„) of the randomly built-up styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers according to component B which are suitable according to the invention can vary over a wide range. The range from 60,000 to 200,000 is preferred. A limiting viscosity of 0.3 to 0.9 (measured in dimethylformamide at 25°C; in this context see Hoffmann, Kromer, Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I [Polymer Analysis I], Stuttgart 1977, page 316 et seq.) is preferred for these products.<br>
Instead of styrene, vinyl (co)polymers B can also comprise styrenes which are substituted on the nucleus, such as p-methylstyrene, vinyltoluene and 2,4-dimethylstyrene, and other substituted styrenes, such as a-methylstyrene, which can optionally be halogenated.<br>

Graft polymers C comprise e.g. graft copolymers with rubber-elastic properties which are substantially obtainable from at least 2 of the following monomers: chloroprene, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, styrene, acrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, vinyl acetate and (meth)-acrylic acid esters having 1 to 18 C atoms in the alcohol component; that is to say polymers such as are described e.g. in "Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry]" (Houben-Weyl), vol. 14/1, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1961, p. 393-406 and in C.B. Bucknall, "Toughened Plastics", Appl. Science Publishers, London 1977. Preferred polymers C are partly crosslinked and have gel contents of more than 20 wt.%, preferably more than 40 wt.%, in particular more than 60 wt.%.<br>
Preferred graft polymers C include graft polymers of:<br>

Preferred graft polymers C are e.g. polybutadienes, butadiene/styrene copolymers and acrylate rubbers grafted with styrene and/or acrylonitrile and/or (meth)acrylic acid alkyl esters; i.e. copolymers of the type described in DE-OS 194 173 (= US-PS 3 564 077); and polybutadienes or butadiene/styrene or butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, polyisobutenes or poryisoprenes grafted with acrylic or methacrylic acid alkyl esters, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene and/or alkylstyrenes, such as are described e.g. in DE-OS 23 48 377 (= US-PS 3 919 353).<br>
Particularly preferred polymers C are e.g. ABS polymers, such as are described e.g. in DE-OS 20 35 390 (= US-PS 3 644 574) or in DE-OS 22 48 242 (= GB-PS 1 409 275).<br>
Particularly preferred graft polymers C are graft polymers which are obtainable by a grafting reaction of<br>
I.	10 to 70, preferably 15 to 50, in particular 20 to 40 wt.%, based on the graft<br>
product, of at least one (meth)acrylic acid ester or 10 to 70, preferably 15 to<br><br>
50, in particular 20 to 40 wt.% of a mixture of 10 to 50, preferably 20 to 35 wt.%, based on the mixture, of acrylonitrile or (meth)acrylic acid ester and 50 to 90, preferably 65 to 80 wt.%, based on the mixture, of styrene on<br>
II. 30 to 90, preferably 50 to 85, in particular 60 to 80 wt.%, based on the graft product, of a butadiene polymer with at least 50 wt.%, based on II, of butadiene radicals as the graft base.<br>
The gel content of graft base II is preferably at least 20 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene), the degree of grafting G is 0.15 to 0.55 and the average particle diameter d50 of the graft polymer is 0.05 to 2 urn, preferably 0.1 to 0.6μm.<br>
(Meth)acrylic acid esters I are esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and monohydric alcohols having 1 to 18 C atoms. Methyl, ethyl and propyl methacrylate are particularly preferred.<br>
In addition to butadiene radicals, graft base II can contain up to 50 wt.%, based on II, of radicals of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, acrylonitrile, esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid having 1 to 4 C atoms in the alcohol component (such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and ethyl methacrylate), vinyl esters and/or vinyl ethers. The preferred graft base II comprises pure polybutadiene.<br>
The degree of grafting G designates the weight ratio of grafted-on grafting monomer to graft base and has no dimensions.<br>
The average particle size d50 is the diameter above and below which in each case 50 wt.% of the particles lie. It can be determined by means of ultracentrifuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-796).<br><br>
Particularly preferred polymers C are e.g. also graft polymers of<br>
(a)	20 to 90 wt.%, based on C, of acrylate rubber having a glass transition temperature below -20°C as the graft base and<br>
(b)	10 to 80 wt.%, based on C, of at least one polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer (cf. C.l) as the grafting monomer.<br>
The acrylate rubbers (a) of polymers C are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally with up to 40 wt.%, based on (a), of other polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Preferred polymerizable acrylic acid esters include C1-C8-alkyl esters, for example the methyl, ethyl, butyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl ester; halogenoalkyl esters, preferably halogeno-C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as chloroethyl acrylate, and mixtures of these monomers.<br>
For crosslinking, monomers having more than one polymerizable double bond can be copolymerized. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids having 3 to 8 C atoms and unsaturated monohydric alcohols having 3 to 12 C atoms or saturated polyols having 2 to 4 OH groups and 2 to 20 C atoms, such as e.g. ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and allyl methacrylate; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as e.g. trivinyl and triallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as di- and trivinylbenzenes; and also triallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate.<br>
Preferred crosslinking monomers are allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl phthalate and heterocyclic compounds which contain at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups.<br>
Particularly preferred crosslinking monomers are the cyclic monomers triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, trivinyl cyanurate, triacryloylhexahydro-s-triazine and triallylbenzenes.<br><br>
The amount of crosslinking monomers is preferably 0.02 to 5, in particular 0.05 to 2 wt.%, based on graft base (a).<br>
With cyclic crosslinking monomers having at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups, it is advantageous to limit the amount to less than 1 wt.% of graft base (a).<br>
Preferred "other" polymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers which can optionally be used, in addition to the acrylic acid esters, for the preparation of graft base (a) are e.g. acrylonitrile, styrene, oc-methylstyrene, acrylamides, vinyl C1-C6-alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate and butadiene. Preferred acrylate rubbers as graft base (a) are emulsion polymers which have a gel content of at least 60 wt.%.<br>
Further suitable graft bases are silicone rubbers with grafting-active positions such as are described in the Offenlegungsschriften DE-OS 37 04 657, DE-OS 37 04 655, DE-OS 36 31 540 and DE-OS 36 31 539.<br>
The gel content of graft base (a) is determined at 25°C in dimethylformamide (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I and II [Polymer Analysis I and II], Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
Since as is known the grafting monomers are not necessarily grafted completely on to the graft base during the grafting reaction, according to the invention graft polymers C are also to be understood as those products which are obtained by polymerization of the grafting monomers in the presence of the graft base.<br>
Component C can also be a mixture of graft polymers.<br>
Component D<br>
Compounds of zinc with metals of main groups 3 to 5 and sub-groups 1 to 8 of the<br><br>
periodic table, preferably main groups 3 to 5 and sub-groups 4 to 8, with at least one element chosen from oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur and silicon can be used as component D.<br>
Zinc compounds which can preferably be employed according to the invention are zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, zinc phosphate, zinc borate and/or zinc sulfates. Zinc sulfide and zinc borate are particularly preferred. Zinc sulfide is very highly preferred.<br>
According to the invention, the average particle diameter is 1 nm to 20 |im, preferably 1 nm to 10μrn.<br>
If zinc sulfide is employed, it is very advantageous, for example, if the average particle diameter is 150 to 1,800 nm, preferably 200 to 500 nm, particularly preferably 280 to 400 nm.<br>
If zinc borate is used, the average particle diameter is in the range from 0.5 u.m to 15 μm, preferably 1 urn -12μm, particularly preferably 2 to 10μm.<br>
Particle size and particle diameter always means the average particle diameter d50 determined by ultracentrifuge measurements by the method of W. Scholtan et al. Kolloid-Z. und Z. Polymere 250(1972), p. 782 to 796.<br>
The zinc compounds can be in the form of powders, pastes, sols, dispersions or suspensions. Powders can be obtained by precipitation from dispersions, sols or suspensions.<br>
Component E<br>

To prepare a coagulated mixture of C and the fluorinated polyolefin, an aqueous emulsion (latex) of a graft polymer C having average latex particle diameters of 0.05 to 2 μm, in particular 0.1 to 0.6 μm, is first mixed with a fine-particled emulsion of a fluorinated polyolefin in water having average particle diameters of 0.05 to 20 μm, in particular 0.08 to 10 μm; suitable tetrafluoroethylene polymer emulsions conventionally have solids contents of 30 to 70 wt.%, in particular 50 to 60 wt.%.<br>
The aqueous emulsion of graft polymer C has solids contents of 25 to 60 wt.%,<br><br>
preferably 30 to 45 wt.%, in particular 30 to 35 wt.%.<br>

The emulsion mixture is coagulated in a known manner, for example by spray drying, freeze drying or coagulation by means of addition of inorganic or organic salts, acids or bases or organic water-miscible solvents, such as alcohols and ketones, preferably at temperature of 20 to 150°C, in particular 50 to 100°C. If necessary, drying can be carried out at 50 to 200°C, preferably 70 to 100°C.<br>
Suitable tetrafluoroethylene polymer emulsions are commercially available products and are available, for example, from DuPont as Teflon® 30 N.<br>

The individual constituents can be mixed in a known manner both successively and simultaneously, and in particular both at about 20°C (room temperature) and at a higher temperature.<br>
The moulding compositions of the present invention can be used for the production of all types of shaped articles. In particular, shaped articles can be produced by injection moulding. Examples of shaped articles which can be produced are: housing components of all types, e.g. for domestic appliances, such as juice presses, coffee machines and mixers, or for office machines, such as computers, printers and monitors, or covering sheets for the building sector and components for the motor vehicle sector. They are moreover employed in the field of electrical engineering, because they have very good electrical properties.<br>
The moulding compositions are particularly suitable for the production of thin-walled mouldings (e.g. data technology housing components), where particularly high requirements are imposed on the notched impact strength and stress-cracking resistance of the plastics employed.<br>
Another form of processing is the production of shaped articles by blow moulding or by thermoforming from previously produced sheets or films.<br><br>
