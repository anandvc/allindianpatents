The Patent Act, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE.SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section   10;   Rule  13)<br>
1)	"A PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE OF FUSED COTTON STRAPS FOR COTTON STRAP BRASSIERES".<br>
2)	MR. KIRIT P. MANIAR (Indian National) having office at    1/206, Vaishali Industrial<br>
	Estate, Mhatre Wadi Road, Dahisar (West),<br>
	MUMBAI-400 068.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed :<br><br>
The present invention relates to "a process of manufacture of fused cotton straps for cotton strap brassieres".<br>
According to the conventional method in order to make strap for brassiere, a strip of cloth is fused with plastic strip (cloth is cut into a strip, after which a plastic strip is put over the cloth and the cloth is folded so as to cover the plastic strip; the folded cloth with the plastic strip inside is heated as a result of which the plastic strip melts and sticks to the cloth). The strip thus formed is used as strap.<br>
In the document EP 1101418 manufacturing of brassier is done by using fabric strip &amp; fabric web joining of straps is done ultrasonicaliy .this fabric material causes allergeric effect such as itching &amp; white spots on body whereas in our invention straps is made of cotton strip, plastic strip ,&amp; gummed canvass this does not cause any allergeric effect.<br>
In document, Indian specification 51703 the brassier is usually fastened at the back of weaver by means of two end strips which is provided with pieces of elastic or like material sewn on to the strips but it has some drawbacks it is an indispensable requirement that a separate set of hooks &amp; eyelet is necessary for each separate garments. Moreover , as the pieces of elastic or like material are sewn on the ends of the brassier they cannot be detached during the washing of garments &amp; therefore they soon lose their elasticity as a result of frequent washing .<br>
•.:'•■.      ,J/i- '    ! ::!    (  . -, V   \v I. .': t'.i.S    Hi       ,<br>
I	.<br>
In document GB882589 manufacturing of brassier is done by using fabric strip &amp; fabric web. But this type of brassier is not much durable. In document Indian Specification 17275 relates to brassier for women's wear of the kind having breast support of substantially triangular form overlapping brmtersecting m front &amp; wherein a tension is produced along the edge of each support by combined action of shoulder straps &amp; lateral straps. This straps would snag or hold on other garments whereas present invention does not snag on other garment.<br><br>
'Eke straps made by the conventional manufacturing process usually have the following disadvantages :-<br>
These straps are not durable as the bond between the plastic strip &amp; the cloth strip detaches as a result of washing or use.<br>
The straps made by the conventional manufacturing process hurt the skin if they get twisted, since the inner strip is made of plastic.<br>
The conventional strap would not snag or hold on other garments.<br>
The conventional strap is not comfortable to the weaver.<br>
The conventional strap would be damaged in the wash.<br>
Objectives:-<br><br>
The present invention "a process of manufacture of fused cotton straps for cotton strap brassieres" is designed with a goal to overcome the disadvantages of conventional method of manufacture of straps and to provide a better alternative.<br>
The first objective of the present" mvehuon is tocdevelop a strap which is durable and of superior quality.<br>
The second objective of the present invention is to develop a strap which will not hurt the skin or cause discomfort.<br>
The present invention should not snag or hold on other garments.<br>
The present invention should not be damaged in the wash.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention should be manufacture by cold cutting, so that it remain relatively ft, having not been stiffened by a heated cutting tool and there is no injury to the weaver.<br>
The present invention should be comfortable to the weaver.<br>
Detail Description:-<br>
According to the present invention in order to make strap for brassier, a strip of gummed canvas is covered by a piece of cloth and stitched. The stitched strip is fused (heated). As a result the canvas sticks to the cloth.<br>
A strip of cloth (measuring approximatelyw3 ,cms) lis folded with 2 layers of fusible interlining (measuring approximately 1.3 cms) inside with the gummed side facing the cloth. This is then stitched at the centre and hot pressed, so that the gummed fusible mterlining sticks to the cloth on both sides and makes it firm. In the present method, a strip of cotton cloth (e.g. Poplin) measuring approximately 3.1 cms is cut from a lump of cloth. A strip of fusible mterlining measuring approximately 1.3 cms is cut from a lump of fusible mterlining. Now the strip of cloth is folded at the centre with 2 layers of fusible interlining strip inside. The gummed side of me fusible mterlining always faces the cloth. The strip now formed is stitched at the centre and then hot pressed. So that the gummed surface of the fusible mterlining gets stuck to the cloth, making it firm.<br>
Advantages:-<br>
The present invention "a process of manufacture of fused cotton straps for cotton strap<br>
brassieres" has many advantages over conventional methods, some of which are mentioned<br>
below.<br>
The straps made by the present process^ are durable and of superior quality since the<br>
bonding does not detach due to washing.<br>
Since the straps made by the present process do not have plastic strips, they do not hurt the<br>
skin or cause discomfort even when twisted.<br><br>
The straps made by the present process do not snag or hold on other garments.<br>
The straps made by the present process do not damaged in wash.<br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
(1)	A Process of Manufacture of "fused cotton straps for cotton brassieres" for which, a strip of gummed canvass is covered by a piece of cloth thereafter, canvass and piece of cloth are stitched together/The stitched strip is then fused or heated due to which the canvass is properly stitched with the cloth. A strip of cotton measuring approx 3 cms is folded with a strip of plastic measuring approx 0.6cms inside and hot pressed. A strip of cotton cloth measures approximately 31cm is cut from a lump of cloth and it is folded with 2 layers of fusible interlining measures approximately 1.3cms cut from lump of fusible mterlining. The gummed side of the fusible interlining always faces the cloth. The strap is stitched at the centre and then hot pressed. So that the gummed surface of the fusible interlining get stuck to the cloth, making it firm;<br>
(2)	A "fused cotton strap" as claimed in claim 1 which is manufacture by cold cutting, so that it remain relatively soft.<br>
