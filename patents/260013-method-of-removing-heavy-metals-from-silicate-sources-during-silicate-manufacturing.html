Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods for the removal of heavy metals from a<br>
metal silicate during the process of manufacturing of such a material. With the reliance<br>
upon lower cost silicon dioxide starting materials (known to exhibit elevated amounts of<br>
heavy metals therein) for the purpose of producing metal silicates (such as sodium<br>
silicate, as one example), it has been realized that removal of significant amounts of such<br>
heavy metals is necessary to comply with certain regulatory requirements in order to<br>
provide a finished material that exhibits the same low level of heavy metal contamination<br>
as compared with finished materials that are made from more expensive, purer starting<br>
silicon dioxides. Two general methods may be followed for such decontamination<br>
purposes. One entails the introduction of a calcium phosphate material, such as<br>
dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and/or hydroxyapatite, to a formed metal<br>
silicate solution but prior to filtering (the post-silicate method). The other requires the<br>
introduction of calcium phosphate material (again, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate,<br>
and/or dicalcium phosphate) in a silicon dioxide, caustic, and water slurry with said<br>
dicalcium phosphate thus present throughout the overall reaction steps of metal silicate<br>
formation and is removed by filtering (the pre-silicate method). In each situation, the<br>
hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, or dicalcium phosphate actually aids in rendering<br>
immobile the heavy metals therein, such as lead, cadmium, and the like, thereby<br>
preventing release of high amounts of such heavy metals from products for which the<br>
target metal silicates are considered as starting materials. Thus, the heavy metal-<br><br>
containing metal silicates may then be utilized to produce precipitated silicas, as one<br>
example, that exhibit much lower levels of heavy metals as compared with the original<br>
silicon dioxide source.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Heavy metals, such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, copper, and zinc, exhibit differing<br>
levels of toxicity within mammals. Particularly when ingested and in a state that can be<br>
metabolized and absorbed in the body, i.e., when it is ingested in a bioavailable form,<br>
such metals exhibit a propensity for toxic effects, even in low amounts, and upon<br>
accumulation within the body. As a result, regulatory agencies at both the state and<br>
federal levels have enacted regulations in terms of the maximum amount of such heavy<br>
metals that are generally permitted within materials that have the potential for human<br>
consumption. Thus, it is important to develop methods for minimizing the amount of<br>
such heavy metals within materials that may be utilized and ingested by humans (and<br>
other mammals).<br>
Included within such materials are spray- or flash-dried metal silicates,<br>
precipitated silicas, silica gels, silicates, and other products that are made from silicon<br>
dioxide sources. End use formulations include many different cleaning preparations,<br>
such as dentifrices, cosmetic compositions, such as body powders, and the like, and other<br>
like applications, such as anti-caking and/or free-flowing agents that necessarily require<br>
human consumption or food contact, such as paper, plastic and rubber fillers, and<br>
pharmaceutical excipients for proper utilization thereof. Such materials that form much<br>
of the basis of these end use formulations are produced from silicon dioxide sources of<br><br>
various levels of heavy metal contamination. The most expensive silicon dioxide sources<br>
are considered the most pure in terms of such levels of heavy metal presence and thus<br>
generally do not require any modification to reduce potential toxic effects that may result<br>
therefrom. However, as the necessity for lower costs for source materials increases,<br>
and/or the source of pure silicon dioxide materials becomes rarer, it has thus become<br>
important to provide some manner of reducing the amount of heavy metals present within<br>
either such starting materials or, more particularly, within intermediate materials<br>
produced therefrom.<br>
Precipitated silicas are basically produced via the initial production of metal<br>
silicates (such as, without limitation, sodium silicate) and then exposing such a material<br>
to a mineral acid (sulfuric acid, as one example), and subsequently precipitating the<br>
resultant silica produced thereby. Metal silicates, such as calcium silicate and sodium<br>
aluminosilicate, can be produced via initial sodium silicate production and addition of a<br>
metal species, such as calcium hydroxide, and an acid species to the reaction mixture to<br>
produce for instance, calcium silicate. Silica gels may also be formed through reaction of<br>
sodium silicate with acid under different conditions. In essence, it has been realized that<br>
the ability to reduce the amount of heavy metals within such ultimate products may be<br>
addressed during one of the process steps for producing the needed metal silicate<br>
intermediate material.<br>
There have been many discussions of technologies for the removal of heavy<br>
metals, most prominently lead, from various waste materials and soils, mainly due to<br>
contamination through lead leakage or disposal. Such treatments, which include various<br>
methods including, generally speaking, thermal, biological, and physical and/or chemical<br><br>
treatments, have proven relatively effective for waste materials (sludges) and<br>
contaminated grounds (soils); however, nothing has been presented within the prior art<br>
that concerns the ability to reduce levels of heavy metals within specific silicate products,<br>
and certainly not during a metal silicate production method. Such prior techniques<br>
generally require soil removal removing the contaminated soil, treating it, and either<br>
replacing it on-site or disposing of it away from the area of contamination. Further<br>
developments for such decontamination of soils and sludges have involved flushing of<br>
such soil and/or sludge materials with fluids for lead dissolution, followed by potentially<br>
complex processes including immobilization of the heavy metals, precipitation of the<br>
heavy metals in an insoluble form, degradation of the heavy metal-containing materials<br>
by chemical or biological techniques (such that the heavy metals are solubilized,<br>
followed by removal of the solubilized heavy metals), or attenuation of the heavy metals<br>
by addition of inert materials to the heavy metal-contaminated soil or waste. Again, these<br>
methods do not address the ability to treat silicon dioxide materials during a silicate-<br>
producing process, and, as alluded to above, are rather complex in the function.<br>
Phosphate materials have been suggested as possible additives to remove certain<br>
heavy metals, such as lead, from aqueous solutions, but not from solid particles or during<br>
the formation of such solid particles. Therefore, although use of phosphate minerals for<br>
immobilizing lead has been suggested in the prior art, there has been no prior disclosure<br>
of a method for accomplishing immobilization of lead or other heavy metals from either<br>
formed silicate or within a slurry from which such silicate materials are formed using<br>
solid calcium phosphate-containing materials within a high pH range.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide a relatively<br>
simple, yet significantly improved method of removing substantial amounts of<br>
undesirable heavy metal contaminates from metal silicate materials. It is an additional<br>
advantage of the invention to permit the utilization of readily available, inexpensive solid<br>
calcium phosphate containing materials, specifically hydroxyapatite and dicalcium<br>
phosphate, directly within a metal silicate forming process for the purpose of drastically<br>
reducing the amount of undesirable heavy metal contaminates therein.<br>
Accordingly, the instant invention encompasses a method of producing a metal<br>
silicate material, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing a silicon dioxide source;<br>
b)	reacting said silicon dioxide source with a caustic to form a metal silicate<br>
solution;<br>
c)	introducing a calcium phosphate material selected from the group consisting<br>
of hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and any mixtures thereof,<br>
to said formed metal silicate solution; and<br>
d)	removing any resultant insoluble heavy metal complexes and/or salts from<br>
said metal silicate solution.<br>
This invention also encompasses a method of producing a metal silicate material<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing a silicon dioxide source;<br>
b)	reacting said silicon dioxide source with a soda ash to form a solid metal<br>
silicate;<br><br>
c)	dissolving solid metal silicate with water to form a metal silicate solution;<br>
d)	introducing a calcium phosphate material selected from the group consisting<br>
of hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and any mixtures thereof,<br>
to said formed metal silicate solution; and<br>
e)	removing any resultant insoluble heavy metal complexes and/or salts from<br>
said metal silicate solution.<br>
This invention also encompasses another method of producing a metal silicate<br>
material comprising the steps of<br>
a)	providing a silicon dioxide source;<br>
b)	mixing said silicon dioxide source with a caustic and water in order to form a<br>
slurry thereof;<br>
c)	introducing a calcium phosphate material selected from the group consisting<br>
of hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and any mixtures thereof,<br>
to said slurry; and<br>
d)	allowing said resultant slurry of step "c" to form a metal silicate solution; and<br>
e)	removing any resultant insoluble heavy metal complexes and/or salts<br>
from said resultant metal silicate solution.<br>
Such methods are very selective in terms of the specific reactants required for<br>
effective heavy metal removal, as well as the specific introduction step of such materials<br>
therein. For the calcium phosphate post-silicate methods, such an additive must be<br>
introduced after silicate solution formation has at least been initiated, preferably, though<br>
not necessarily, subsequent to actual metal silicate production. It has been realized that<br>
the hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, and/or dicalcium phosphate (for this pre-<br><br>
silicate method, hydroxyapatite is preferred, however) effectively reacts with the heavy<br>
metal compounds (such as lead, for instance) to form insoluble complexes and/or salts<br>
that can then be relatively easily removed therefrom during, for instance, and without<br>
limitation, a filtration step for such insoluble compounds. Likewise, for the pre-silicate<br>
method, such an additive must be introduced during or directly after the reaction slurry of<br>
silicon dioxide and water has been formed. In this manner, it is believed that the<br>
preferred dicalcium phosphate (for this pre-silicate method) more easily reacts with the<br>
heavy metals present therein and effectively results in the formation of the same type of<br>
insoluble heavy metal complexes and/or salts that may ultimately be removed through<br>
relatively simple procedures. Importantly, it has been found, quite unexpectedly, that<br>
such specific reactions are unique in that introduction of dicalcium phosphate to an<br>
already formed metal silicate will not result in any noticeable reduction in heavy metal<br>
species from such a formed product. As well, addition of hydroxyapatite within the<br>
slurry stage of silicate formation is needed at a higher dosage level to provide any<br>
appreciable modification in heavy metal presence within the final metal silicate product.<br>
Thus, as alluded to, these specific methods are highly unexpected as the selection of<br>
additive during specific process steps provide the desired outcome.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Commercially, alkali metal silicate solutions of SiO2: M2O mole ratio of about 0.5<br>
to about 4 are prepared by 2 methods: the hydrothermal reaction of quartz and a caustic,<br>
such as caustic soda, in the presence of water and the furnace method to make<br>
"waterglass" of reacting quartz and a carbonate, such as sodium carbonate. The alkali<br><br>
metal may be sodium, potassium or lithium, with sodium preferred. The quartz used is a<br>
finely ground sand, also known as silica flour.<br>
In the hydrothermal method, sodium silicate with a SiO2:Na2O mole ratio of 2.0<br>
to about 2.70, preferably 2.4 to 2.7, and more preferably 2.5 to 2.65 was produced by<br>
heating, such as with a saturated steam or electrical heating, to about 148 °C (0.34 MPa)<br>
to about 216 °C (2.07 MPa), preferably from 170 °C (0.69 MPa) to 208 °C (1.72 MPa),<br>
and more preferably from 185 °C (1.03 MPa) to 198 °C (1.38 MPa), a stoichiometric<br>
amount of sand, caustic and water in an agitated pressure reactor is cooked from 2 to 6<br>
hours, preferably from 3 to 5 hours. Unreacted sand is then separated from the formed<br>
sodium silicate solution by filtration, such as with a pressure leaf filter.<br>
In the furnace method, waterglass having a SiO2:Na2O mole ratio of 0.5 to about<br>
4, preferably about 2.0 to 3.5 and more preferably 3.2 to 3.4, is produced by heating<br>
stoichiometric amounts of sand and soda ash (Na2CO3) to 1100 °C to about 1400 °C in an<br>
oil- or gas-fired open-hearth regenerative furnace or electric or plasma furnace. The<br>
formed glass is cooled, crushed and dissolved in batch atmospheric or pressure dissolvers<br>
or continuous atmospheric dissolver, preferably in a pressure dissolver using saturated<br>
steam (as the heating media) and water to dissolve the waterglass in the process ranges<br>
from 134 °C (0.2 MPa) to 215 °C (2 MPa), preferably from 165 °C (0.6 MPa) to 204 °C<br>
(1.6 MPa), and more preferably from 184 °C (1 MPa) to 192 °C (1.2 MPa).The<br>
solubilized silicate solution is then filtered by a pre-coat filter.<br>
The level of contaminant metals present in the metal silicate solution is dependent<br>
upon the silicon dioxide (sand) source used to make the metal silicate solution. Typical<br>
contaminant metals of concern are lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), arsenic (As),<br><br>
and zinc (Zn). The amount of contaminant metal removed is dependent on the initial<br>
concentration present, the particular calcium phosphate treatment additive and amount<br>
used, and the treatment time and temperature.<br>
One method of reducing the metal contaminant level in the metal silicate solution<br>
involves adding a calcium phosphate, such as hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, and<br>
tricalcium phosphate, preferably hydroxyapatite, to the formed silicate in an amount of<br>
0.1% to 50 %, based on the silicate weight, preferably 0.5% to 10%, and more<br>
preferably 1% to 5% and mixing and heating the slurry to about 50°C to about 90 °C,<br>
preferably about 60 °C to about 85 °C for about 15 min to about 300 min, preferably<br>
from 30 min to 120 min, and more preferably for about 30 to about 60 min. Thereafter,<br>
the calcium phosphate additive, which has the metal contaminants immobilized thereon,<br>
is removed from the metal silicate solution by filtration, centrifugation, or vibrating<br>
screening, preferably by filtration, such as with a pressure leaf filter. This method is<br>
useful to remove heavy metals from sodium silicate solution made by hydrothermal<br>
reaction or made by dissolving waterglass and of any concentration or mole ratio.<br>
Another method of reducing the metal contaminant level in the silicate solution is<br>
by adding the calcium phosphate with the other reactants used to make the metal silicate.<br>
To make sodium silicate for instance, water and stoichiometric amounts of sand and<br>
caustic soda are added to a stirred hydrothermal reactor. The calcium phosphate, such as<br>
hydroxyapatite, dicalcium phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate, preferably dicalcium<br>
phosphate, is added to the reactor in an amount of about 0.1% to about 20%, preferably<br>
from about 0.5% to about 10%), and more preferably from about 1% to about 5% based<br>
on the weight of the sand used. The pressure reactor is heated to about 0.34 MPa to about<br><br>
2.07 MPa, preferably 0.69 MPa to 1.72 MPa, and more preferably from 1.03 MPa to 1.38<br>
MPa for about 2 to about 6 hours, preferably about 3 to about 5 hours. (Higher<br>
temperature/pressure provides higher mole ratio of sodium silicate.) Thereafter, the<br>
mixture is filtered to remove unreacted sand and the calcium phosphate additive, which<br>
has the metal contaminants immobilized thereon, by filtration, centrifugation, or vibrating<br>
screening, preferably by filtration, such as pressure leaf filtration.<br>
The decontaminated silicate can be used as such, as an ingredient in finished<br>
formulations or as a raw material to prepare precipitated silica, silica gel, calcium silicate,<br>
magnesium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate, and the like, which meet food, cosmetic and<br>
pharmaceutical requirements for trace metal contaminant levels.<br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Metal Determination Method - Post-Silicate Methods<br>
Metal concentration was determined using a Perkin Elmer Elan DRC Plus<br>
ICP/MS. The sodium silicate sample was solubilized by heating 2 g of the silicate with<br>
about 10-12 ml hydrofluoric acid and about 5 ml nitric acid in a 50-ml platinum dish until<br>
completely dry, to remove the silica. Next, 5-7 ml of HNO3 and about 25 ml of water<br>
was added and heated to dissolve the residue. The solution was quantitatively transferred<br>
to a 100-ml volumetric flask and filled to volume with deionized water. Then, 2.5 ml of<br>
this sample solution and internal standards added to compensate for transport conditions<br>
were diluted to 50 ml with water and aspirated into the ICP/MS. The metal<br><br>
concentrations in the sample were determined by comparing the sample response to metal<br>
standards of known concentration.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Liquid sodium silicate having a concentration of 32.6%, a mole ratio of 2.68, and<br>
containing 0.95 ppm Pb was mixed with an equal weight of a 27.1% aqueous suspension<br>
of hydroxyapatite (H0252 Hydroxyapatite Type I available from Sigma-Aldrich, St.<br>
Louis, Missouri) for 1 hr at a temperature of about 160°F (71°C). Thereafter the solid<br>
particles of hydroxyapatite were separated from the sodium silicate by withdrawing a<br>
portion of the silicate mixture with a syringe (Becton Dickinson model 309585 and<br>
forcing the mixture through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (VWR 28145-481. The recovered,<br>
filtered sodium silicate was analyzed for Pb according to the method described above and<br>
found to contain 0.020 ppm Pb (20 ppb Pb), which was about a 50 times reduction in lead<br>
(Pb) concentration.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In order to determine the treatment time necessary to maximize the amount of<br>
lead removed from sodium silicate, aliquots of the treated sodium silicate were<br>
withdrawn at intervals and analyzed for lead concentration. To a Teflon beaker, was<br>
added 100 g of sodium silicate solution (32.6%, 2.68 mole ratio, 0.95 ppm Pb) and 1 g of<br>
H0252 Hydroxyapatite suspension available from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri.<br>
The mixture was agitated with a magnetic stir bar and heated to 60°C on a hot plate.<br><br>
Samples were withdrawn from the beaker at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes, utilizing a<br>
syringe filter (0.45 µm filter) to separate the solid material (hydroxyapatite) from the<br>
sodium silicate solution. The sodium silicate solution was subsequently analyzed<br>
according to the method described above for lead, calcium and aluminum concentration.<br>
Results are summarized below in Table 1.<br><br>
As shown in Table 1,1% hydroxyapatite was very effective in reducing trace lead<br>
levels in the liquid silicate, while not affecting the calcium and aluminum levels. The<br>
lead concentration drops continually for the first hour to about 50% of the initial<br>
concentration and then levels off. The calcium and alumina levels are scattered around<br>
the mean of 22 ppm for calcium and 538 ppm for alumina.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this example, several different phosphates (several solid hydroxyapatites,<br>
natural apatite, dicalcium phosphate and tricalcium phosphate) were substituted for the<br>
hydroxyapatite suspension used in Examples 1-2. The same treatment procedure used in<br>
Example 2 was followed, except the treatment levels of the various phosphates were 1%<br>
and 3% based on the sodium silicate. The sodium silicate (32.6%, 2.68 mole ratio) and<br>
phosphate were mixed together for 1 hr at 60 °C. The samples were analyzed according<br>
to the method described above and the initial and after-treatment lead concentration [Pb]<br>
is given in Table 2<br><br>
C93-15 and C53-83MF are grades of pentacalcium hydroxyorthophosphate,<br>
Ca5(PO4)3OH referred to herein as hydroxyapatite, available from Gallard-Schlesinger<br>
Industries, Plainview, New York; GFS is a pentacalcium hydroxyorthophosphate,<br>
Ca5(PO4)3OH referred to herein as hydroxyapatite, available from GFS Chemicals,<br><br>
Powell, Ohio; Natural Apatite is a natural hydroxyapatite derived from fish bones<br>
available from UFA Ventures, Carlsbad, NM; DCP is dicalcium phosphate, CaHPO4<br>
available from Rhodia Corporation, Cranbury, N.J.; and TCP is tricalcium phosphate,<br>
Ca3(PO4)2, available from Gallard-Schlesinger Industries, Plainview, New York.<br>
The synthetic hydroxyapatite samples reduced the Pb content of the sodium<br>
silicate by about 40% at a 1% treatment level and by about 70% at a 3% treatment level<br>
and tricalcium phosphate was nearly as effective.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In example 4, 100 g of 32.6% sodium silicate having a 2.65 mole ratio was heated<br>
on a hot plate to between 71-82 °C in a Teflon beaker as control and then added lg of<br>
hydroxyapatite for sample testing. In Example 4A, several metals were also intentionally<br>
spiked into 150 g of 32.6% sodium silicate having a 2.65 mole ratio by pipetting 0.25 mg<br>
each of Pb, Cd, and Cu into the sodium silicate solution as control and then added 1% of<br>
hydroxyapatite for sample testing. The mixture was agitated with a magnetic stir bar and<br>
allowed to react for 1 hour. Samples were withdrawn from the beaker utilizing a syringe<br>
filter (0.45 urn filter) to separate the solid material (hydroxyapatite) from the sodium<br>
silicate solution.<br>
Additionally, a control was made and tested with Control 4 being a portion of the<br>
sodium silicate used for Example 4 with no hydroxyapatite added.<br>
The sodium silicate solutions were subsequently analyzed according to the<br>
method described above for lead, cadmium, copper and zinc and the results are<br>
summarized in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
It is evident from the results given that hydroxyapatite is very effective in<br>
reducing contamination of several metals. The treatment of a 2.65 molar ratio sodium<br>
silicate with 1% hydroxyapatite was also very effective in reducing higher metal<br>
contamination levels from a less pure (higher metal) sodium silicate solution,<br>
represented by the spiked samples of Example 4A.<br>
EXAMPLE 5-6<br>
In Example 5, 100 g of 37.5% sodium silicate having a molar ratio of 3.2 was<br>
heated on a hot plate to between 71-82 °C in a Teflon beaker as control and then added lg<br>
of hydroxyapatite for sample testing. In Example 6, several metals were also intentionally<br>
spiked into 150 g of 32.6% sodium silicate having a 2.65 mole ratio by pipetting 0.25 mg<br>
each of Pb, As, Cd, Cu and Zn into the sodium silicate solution as control and then added<br>
1% of hydroxyapatite for sample testing. The mixture was agitated with a magnetic stir<br><br>
bar and allowed to react for 1 hour. Samples were withdrawn from the beaker utilizing a<br>
syringe filter (0.45 µm filter) to separate the solid material (hydroxyapatite) from the<br>
sodium silicate solution.<br>
Additionally, controls were made and tested with Control 5 being a portion of the<br>
sodium silicate used for Example 5 with no hydroxyapatite added and Control 6 being a<br>
portion of the sodium silicate used for Example 6 with no hydroxyapatite added .<br>
The sodium silicate solutions were subsequently analyzed according to the<br>
method described above for lead, arsenic, cadmium, copper and zinc and the results are<br>
summarized in Table 3 below.<br><br>
The treatment of a 3.2 molar ratio sodium silicate with 1% hydroxyapatite was<br>
very effective in reducing the metal contamination levels. The spiked samples show that<br>
hydroxyapatite was even more effective in reducing the metals concentration from a less<br>
pure (higher metal) sodium silicate solution.<br><br>
Metal Determination Method — Pre-Silicate Methods<br>
Metal concentration was determined using a Perkin Elmer Elan DRC Plus<br>
ICP/MS. The sodium silicate sample was solubilized by heating 2 g of the silicate with<br>
about 10-12 ml hydrofluoric acid and about 5 ml nitric acid in a 50-ml platinum dish until<br>
completely dry, removing the silica. Next, 5-7 ml of HNO3 and about 25 ml of water was<br>
added and heated to dissolve the residue. The solution was quantitatively transferred to a<br>
100-ml volumetric flask and filled to volume with deionized water. Then, 2.5 ml of this<br>
sample solution and internal standards added to compensate for transport conditions were<br>
diluted to 50 ml with water and aspirated into the ICP/MS. The metal concentrations in<br>
the sample were determined by comparing the sample response to metal standards of<br>
known concentration.<br>
EXAMPLES 7-10<br>
A method of reducing the lead level in sodium silicate was to add dicalcium<br>
phosphate (DCP) to the hydrothermal reactor with the ingredients used to make sodium<br>
silicate: silica flour and caustic soda (NaOH). Into a 2 liter stirred Parr reactor was added<br>
468 g silica flour (finely ground sand), 442 g of 50% NaOH solution, the specified<br>
amount of dicalcium phosphate (control has no dicalcium phosphate added) and 577 g of<br>
deionized water. (The silica flour starting material contained 4.19 ppm Pb and the<br>
dicalcium phosphate contained 0.019 ppm Pb.) The reactor is heated to 1.38 MPa (about<br>
198°C) with the agitation speed set to the maximum. After the reaction mass reached<br>
1.38 MPa (about 90 min), the reaction was allowed to cook for 4 hrs. The resultant 2.65<br><br>
molar ratio sodium silicate (2.65 mole SiO2:1 mole Na2O) was filtered on a Buchner<br>
funnel to remove the particles of dicalcium phosphate and unreacted sand. The filtered<br>
sodium silicate samples were analyzed according the method described above to<br>
determine lead (Pb) content.<br><br>
The dicalcium phosphate (DCP) is available from Rhodia Corporation, Cranbury,<br>
N.J.<br>
EXAMPLE 11-13<br>
In these examples, sodium silicate was prepared from sand and caustic soda as in<br>
Examplel. For Examples 11 and 12, dicalcium phosphate (DCP) was additionally added to<br>
the reaction ingredients and for Example 13, hydroxyapatite, (HA) was added, whereas the<br>
controls contained no calcium phosphate. Control 11 sample was a sodium silicate control<br>
with no additional metals (spike) added. Example 12 and Control 12 were each spiked<br>
with 2 mg each of lead, cadmium and copper. Where spikes are indicated in the Table 2,<br><br>
two ml of 1000 ppm Pb, 2 ml 1000 ppm Cd, and 2 ml 1000 ppm Cu were added to the<br>
reactor with the other ingredients. The amount of ingredients used is given is Table 2.<br><br>
The sodium silicates produced above were diluted 2:1 with deionized water, i.e. 200<br>
g silicate diluted with 100 g deionized water. The silicates were then vacuum filtered using<br>
a GF/B glass fiber filter and then analyzed for trace metal content according to the metal<br>
determination method described above. The results are summarized below in Table 3.<br><br><br>
A 5% treatment level of dicalcium phosphate (Ex. 11) was able to reduce the lead<br>
concentration in the sodium silicate solution by 37%, the cadmium concentration by 57%<br>
and the copper concentration by about 4%. A 5% treatment level of hydroxyapatite (Ex.<br>
13) was able to reduce the lead concentration in the sodium silicate by 34% and the<br>
copper by 52%. The spiked samples show that a 5% treatment level of dicalcium<br>
phosphate (Ex. 12) was effective in reducing the cadmium and copper concentration in a<br>
sodium silicate containing higher contaminant levels by 81% and 59%, respectively.<br>
