				<td>The Invention relates to makeup water  system in steam surface condenser to condense low pressure exhaus steam coming from steam turbines.<br>
Steam surface condensers are widely used to condense low pressure exhaust steam coming from steam turbines. Heat exchange Institute Standards are used to size these condensers. These are normal shell and tube heat exchangers with exhaust steam entering on shell side condensed by cooling water flowing throuh the tubes. Makeup water will be added in the condenser on shell side to take care of the extra steam requirement for process purposes. These standards specify makeup water addition in to the condensers no more than 5% of the steam being condensed in order to achieve required levels of dearation. Also, this makeup water is not considered in estimation of cooling water requirements.<br>
In the present system, makeup water is added in the exhaust neck above the tubes through a disperser/spray nozzle. The makeup water is normally at the same temperature of cooling water is to be heated to the temperature of steam by direct mixing to avoid subcooling and to achieve required levels of dearation. This is possible only when the makeup quantity is low (less than 5% of steam) in view of high temperature rise and short mixing lengths between steam and makeup water.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present system of steam surfaces condensers with makeup water addition.<br>
The main disadvantage associated with the present system of steam surface condensers is that with the latest technology, gas turbine combined cycle plants and also in thermal plants with huge process requirements, the requirement of make up water addition in the condensers is increasing to as high as 30% of steam quantity and in some process requirements even higher than steam quantity.<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention of proposed makeup water system in steam surface condenser with<br><br>
high makeup water additions, the proposed system to achieve distinct advantages in heating/deaeration levels in the condenser.<br>
Another object of the present invention of proposed makeupo water system is to bring the cooling water requirement down to the extent of makeup water quantity resulting in a cost effective system.<br>
According, to, the present invention there is provided a makeup water  system in steam surface condenser comprising exhaust steam connection to the exhaust neck of the shell provided with a vent connection a condensate outlet and cooling water inlet and outlet to the said condenser provided with condenser tubes and said shell is provided with a makeup water spray arrangement between the exhaust steam connection and the exhaust neck and is connected to a makeup water supply, characterized in that the makeup water is introduced to a makeup water heat exchanger wherein the makeup water is heated very close to steam temperature before it is sprayed through the makeup water spray arrangement in the exhaust neck.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the makeup water system in steam surface condenser.<br>
In the present system, makeup water is added direct to the exhaust neck (2) through a disperser/spray nozzle (9) as shown in Figure 1 in dotted line.<br><br>
The Figure 1 further shows the makeup waer system in steam surface condenser wherein the top of the shell (12) is connected to exhaust steam (1). The shell is increasingly tapered down having an exhaust neck (2). The makeup water spray arrangement<br><br>
(9)	is provided near the top in the exhaust neck (1). The shell<br>
(12) is provided with a vent connection (3) and a condensate<br>
outlet (4). The surface condenser (11) is provided with a cooling water inlet (5) and outlet (6) and condenser tubes (7). The surface condenser (11) is positioned at the lower position of the shell (12) and is below the makeup water heat exchanger (8).<br>
The invention lies in providing a makeup water heat exchanger (8) inlet of which is conneced to the makeup water<br>
(10)	supply and outlet to the makeup water spray arrangement<br>
(9).<br>
With the makeup water (10) quantities increase to 30% or beyond with the present generation power plants, the present system poses problems with regard to heating/deaeration of makeup water (10). Also, this huge quantity of makeup water (10) which helps in condensing steam by way of direct mixing is required to be considered in estimation of cooling water quantity. Thus, when considered, the cooling water requirement will be reduced to the extent of makeup water (10) addition. With this background in the proposed system, the makeup water (10) is introduced through a select number of tubes of the makeup water heat exchanger (8) (determined based on makeup water quantity) located separately at the top of the condenser (11) as shown in Fig.l. This arrangement avoids mixing of makeup water (10) with cooling water, which is essential to maintain condensate purity. In this makeup water heat exchanger (8), the makeup water (10) is heated very close to steam temperature before it is actually sprayed in the exhaust neck (2). This reduces the heating in the spray zone (9) considerably and thus does not call for long mixing lengths for heating/deaeration.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is in relation to non-limiting embodiments and as defined by the accompanying claims.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A makeup water instalment in steam surface condenser comprising<br>
exhaust steam connection (1) to the exhaust neck (2) of the shell (12)<br>
provided with a vent connection (3), a condensate outlet (4) and<br>
cooling water inlet (5) and outlet (6) to the said condenser provided<br>
with condenser tubes (7) and said shell is provided with a makeup<br>
water spray arrangement (9) and is the exhaust steam connection and<br>
the exhaust neck (2) and is connected to makeup water supply (10),<br>
characterized in that the makeup water (10) is introduced to a makeup<br>
water heat exchanger (8) wherein the makeup water (10) is heated<br>
very close to steam temperature before it is sprayed through the<br>
makeup water spray arrangement (9) in the exhaust neck (2).<br>
2.	A makeup water instalment as claimed in claim 1 wherein the top of<br>
the shell has an exhaust neck (2) which is connected to exhaust steam<br>
(1) at the top of said shell.<br>
3.	A makeup water instalment as claimed in claim 1 wherein said shell is<br>
provided with a vent connection (3) near the cooling water inlet (5)<br>
and a condensate outlet (4) at the bottom of said shell.<br>
4 A makeup water instalment in steam surface condenser as herein described and illustrated with the accompanying drawings.<br><br></td>
