				<td>HEAVY AROMATICS CONVERSION CATALYST<br>
COMPOSITION AND PROCESSES THEREFOR AND THEREWITH<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a catalyst composition useful for converting<br>
heavy aromatics, specifically Cg+ aromatics, to lighter aromatic products,<br>
particularly benzene, toluene and xylenes (hereinafter collectively referred to as<br>
BTX), to a process for producing the composition and to a process for using the<br>
composition in a heavy aromatics conversion process.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] A source of benzene and xylenes is catalytic reformate, which is<br>
prepared by contacting a mixture of petroleum naphtha and hydrogen with a strong<br>
hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst, such as platinum, on a moderately acidic<br>
support, such as a halogen-treated alumina. Usually, a Ce to Cg fraction is<br>
separated from the reformate and extracted with a solvent selective for aromatics<br>
or aliphatics to produce a mixture of aromatic compounds that is relatively free of<br>
aliphatics. This mixture of aromatic compounds usually contains BTX, along with<br>
ethylbenzene.<br>
[0003] Refineries have also focused on the production of benzene and xylenes<br>
by transalkylation of Cg+ aromatics and toluene over noble metal-containing<br>
zeolite catalysts. High value petrochemical products, such as benzene and xylenes,<br>
together with ethylbenzene are formed during the transalkylation of €9+ aromatics<br>
and toluene over catalysts containing noble metals. The resulting translation<br>
product is subjected to further separation of non-aromatics, benzene, Cg aromatics<br>
(i.e., ethylbenzene, para-xylene, meta-xylene, and ortho-xylene), unreacted<br>
toluene, and unreacted Cg+ aromatics. Usually, the Cg aromatics product is<br>
subjected to further separation to produce xylenes, particularly, para-xylene.<br>
Lowering the amount of ethylbenzene in the Cg aromatics improves efficiency of<br>
xylene recovery. Therefore, there are strong economic and technical incentives to<br>
decrease the ethylbenzene concentration in the transalkylation product. The<br>
amount of ethylbenzene in the transalkylation product depends primarily on (a) the<br>
feedstock composition and (b) the transalkylation catalyst and the transalkylation<br>
conditions. Typically, the €9+ aromatics feedstock and/or the toluene feed<br>
contains ethylbenzene as an impurity ranging from 0.001 to 4 wt% based on total<br>
weight of the feed. Other than the ethylbenzene in the feedstock, ethylbenzene can<br>
be formed during transalkylation process from a feed comprising ethyl-containing<br>
€9+ aromatics and from various side-reactions.<br>
[0004] One solution to the problem of the ethylbenzene in the transalkylation<br>
product during the transalkylation of heavy aromatics is disclosed in US Patent<br>
No. 5,942,651 and involves the steps of contacting a feed comprising €9+<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons and toluene under transalkylation reaction conditions with<br>
a first catalyst composition comprising a zeolite having a constraint index ranging<br>
from 0.5 to 3, such as ZSM-12, and a hydrogenation component. The effluent<br>
resulting from the first contacting step is then contacted with a second catalyst<br>
composition which comprises a zeolite having a constraint index ranging from 3 to<br>
12, such as ZSM-5, and which may be in a separate bed or a separate reactor from<br>
the first catalyst composition to produce a transalkylation reaction product<br>
comprising benzene and xylene. The ethylbenzene in the feed and/or the<br>
ethylbenzene formed during transalkylation process is partially destroyed by<br>
dealkylation of ethylbenzene to benzene and ethylene.<br>
[0005] US Patent No. 5,905,051 discloses a process for converting a<br>
hydrocarbon stream such as, for example, a Cg+ aromatic compound to Ce to Cg<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes, by contacting the stream with a catalyst<br>
system comprising a first catalyst composition and a second catalyst composition,<br>
wherein said catalyst compositions are present in separate stages and are not<br>
physically mixed or blended and wherein said first catalyst composition is a metalpromoted,<br>
alumina- or silica-bound zeolite beta, and said second catalyst<br>
composition is ZSM-5 having incorporated therein an activity promoter selected<br>
from the group consisting of silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and combinations thereof.<br>
According to the '051 patent, the use of the separate catalytic stages improves the<br>
conversion of €9+ aromatic compounds and naphthalenes to xylenes and decreases<br>
the amount of undesirable ethylbenzene in the product. The ethylbenzene in the<br>
'051 product is about 3-7 wt% of ethylbenzene based on the weight of Cg<br>
aromatics fraction of the resulting product.<br>
[0006] It has now been found that a catalyst system comprising a molecular<br>
sieve exhibits enhanced acidity and hydrogenation activity for substantial removal<br>
of ethyl-group containing aromatic compounds in €9+ aromatic feeds without<br>
overall reduction in the conversion of the €9+ feed to useful compounds, such as<br>
xylenes.<br>

[0019] In another embodiment, the invention relates to a process for producing<br>
a catalyst composition comprising:<br>

[0022] As used herein, the term "lighter aromatic products" is defined to mean<br>
aromatic molecules in products having fewer carbon atoms than the carbon atoms<br>
of aromatic molecules in the feedstock. For example, para-xylene, one of the<br>
resulting products of €9+ transalkylation with toluene and/or benzene, has 8<br>
carbon atoms which is less than 9 or more carbon atoms in €9+ aromatic<br>
molecules.<br>
Catalyst Composition<br>
[0023] The catalyst composition used in the process of the invention<br>
comprises:<br>
(i) an acidity component having an alpha value of at least 300; and<br>
(ii) a hydrogenation component having hydrogenation activity of at<br>
least 300,<br>
[0024] The acidity component is a material of having an alpha value of at least<br>
300, such as, silica-alumina, acidic zicoria, a molecular sieve selected from the<br>
group consisting of a molecular sieve having a MTW structure, a molecular sieve<br>
having a MOR structure, and a porous crystalline inorganic oxide material having<br>
an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima (A) at 12.4±0.25,<br>
6.9±0.15, 3.57±0.07 and 3.42±0.07.<br>
[0025] With regard to the molecular sieve, ZSM-12 is more particularly<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449. Mordenite occurs naturally but may also<br>
be used in one of its synthetic forms, such as TEA-mordenite (i.e., synthetic<br>
mordenite prepared from a reaction mixture comprising a tetraethylammonium<br>
directing agent), which is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,766,093 and 3,894,104.<br>
Examples of suitable porous crystalline inorganic oxide materials having the<br>
defined X-ray diffraction pattern include MCM-22, PSH-3, SSZ-25, MCM-36,<br>
MCM-49 or MCM-56. MCM-22 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,954,325, PSH-3<br>
is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,439,409, SSZ-25 is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,826,667, MCM-36 is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,250,277, MCM-49 is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,236,575 and MCM-56 is described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,362,697. The entire contents of each of the aforementioned patents are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0026] With regard to the molecular sieve, suitable materials having a<br>
constraint index of 3 to 12 include ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-35,<br>
ZSM-48, ZSM-57 and ZSM-58. ZSM-5 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886.<br>

Patent No. 5,336,478. ZSM-23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842. ZSM-35<br>
is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245. ZSM-48 is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,375,573. ZSM-57 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,873,067. ZSM-58 is<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,698,217. Constraint index and a method for its<br>
determination are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,218. The entire contents of<br>
each of the aforementioned patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0027] Typically, the second molecular sieve constitutes from 0 to 95 wt%,<br>
such as from in excess of 20 to 80 wt% based on the total weight of the first and<br>
second molecular sieves in the catalyst composition.<br>
[0028] Where the first molecular sieve is ZSM-12, the ZSM-12 can have a<br>
composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
X203:(n)Y02<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron, indium and/or<br>
gallium, preferably aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element, such as silicon, tin<br>
and/or germanium, preferably silicon; and n is less than 75, such as from 20 to less<br>
than 60. The ZSM-12 may further be selected so as to have an average crystal size<br>
of less than 0.1 micron, such as about 0.05 micron, and a Diffusion Parameter,<br>
D/r2, for mesitylene of at least 1000 x 10"6 sec"1, such as at least 2000 x 10"6 sec"1,<br>
when measured at a temperature of 100°C and a mesitylene pressure of 2 torr.<br>
[0029] As used herein, the Diffusion Parameter of a particular porous<br>
crystalline material is defined as D/r2xl06, wherein D is the diffusion coefficient<br>
(cm2/sec) and r is the crystal radius (cm). The required diffusion parameters can be<br>
derived from sorption measurements provided the assumption is made that the<br>
plane sheet model describes the diffusion process. Thus for a given sorbate<br>
loading Q, the value Q/Qo, where Q» is the equilibrium sorbate loading, is<br>
mathematically related to (Dt2/r)1/2 where t is the time (sec) required to reach the<br>
sorbate loading Q. Graphical solutions for the plane sheet model are given by J.<br>
Crank in "The Mathematics of Diffusion", Oxford University Press, Ely House,<br>
London, 1967.<br>
[0030] The ZSM-12 used as the first molecular sieve may also be arranged to<br>
have an Alpha value of at least 150, such as at least 300. The alpha value test is a<br>
measure of the cracking activity of a catalyst and is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,354,078 and in the Journal of Catalysis. Vol. 4, p. 527 (1965); Vol. 6, p. 278<br>
(1966); and Vol. 61, p. 395 (1980), each incorporated herein by reference as to<br>
that description. The experimental conditions of the test used herein include a<br>
constant temperature of 538°C and a variable flow rate as described in detail in the<br>
Journal of Catalysis, Vol. 61, p. 395.<br>
[0031] ZSM-12 having the composition, crystal size, Diffusion Parameter and<br>
alpha value described in the preceding paragraphs can be produced by<br>
crystallization of a synthesis mixture containing sources of alkali or alkaline earth<br>
metal (M) cations, normally sodium, an oxide of a trivalent element (X), normally<br>
alumina, an oxide of a tetravalent element (Y), normally silica,<br>
methyltriethylammonium ions (R), normally present as the iodide salt, hydroxyl<br>
ions and water. The synthesis mixture may have a composition, expressed in terms<br>
of mole ratios of oxides, as follows:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0032] The synthesis mixture may also contain nucleating seeds of ZSM-12<br>
and, where such seeds are present, they typically constitute 0.05-5 wt% of the<br>
mixture. Crystallization of the synthesis mixture may be carried out under either<br>
stirred or static conditions, preferably stirred conditions, at a temperature of 160°C<br>
or less, such as 140 to 160°C for 48 to 500 hours, whereafter the resultant ZSM-12<br>
crystals are separated from the mother liquor and recovered<br>
[0033] It may be desirable to incorporate each molecular sieve in the catalyst<br>
composition with another material that is resistant to the temperatures and other<br>
conditions employed in the transalkylation process of the invention. Such<br>
materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring<br>
zeolites, as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and/or metal oxides<br>
such as alumina. The inorganic material may be either naturally occurring, or in<br>
the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal<br>
oxides.<br>
[0034] Use of a material in conjunction with each molecular sieve, i.e.<br>
combined therewith or present during its synthesis, which itself is catalytically<br>
active, may change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst composition.<br>
Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion so<br>
that transalkylated products can be obtained in an economical and orderly manner<br>
without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These<br>
catalytically active or inactive materials may be incorporated into, for example,<br>
naturally occurring clays, e.g. bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength<br>
of the catalyst composition under commercial operating conditions. It is desirable<br>
to provide a catalyst composition having good crush strength because in<br>
commercial use, it is desirable to prevent the catalyst composition from breaking<br>
down into powder-like materials.<br>
[0035] Naturally occurring clays that can be composited with the molecular<br>
sieve's as a binder for the catalyst composition include the montmorillonite and<br>
kaolin family, which families include the subbentonites, and the kaolins<br>
commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in<br>
which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or<br>
anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially<br>
subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification.<br>
 [0036] In addition to the foregoing materials, the molecular sieve's can be<br>
composited with a porous matrix binder material, such as an inorganic oxide<br>
selected from the group consisting of silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, thoria,<br>
beryllia, magnesia, and combinations thereof, such as silica-alumina, silicamagnesia,<br>
silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania, as well as<br>
ternary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silicaalumina-<br>
magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia. It may also be advantageous to<br>
provide at least a part of the foregoing porous matrix binder material in colloidal<br>
form to facilitate extrusion of the catalyst composition.<br>
[0037] Each molecular sieve is usually admixed with the binder or matrix<br>
material so that the final catalyst composition contains the binder or matrix<br>
material in an amount ranging from 5 to 90 wt%, and typically from 10 to 60 wt%.<br>
[0038] In the process of the invention, the first and second molecular sieves<br>
are contained in the same catalyst bed. Normally this is achieved either by<br>
physically mixing separate particles of the individual molecular sieves, preferably<br>
in bound form, or by co-extruding a mixture of the molecular sieves, typically<br>
with a binder, such that each particle of the final catalyst composition contains<br>
both the first and second molecular sieves. Alternatively, the particles of one of<br>
the first and second molecular sieves can be formed as a binder for the other of<br>
said first and second molecular sieves, such as is described in International Patent<br>
Publication No. WO 97/45198, the entire contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0039] At least the first molecular sieve, and preferably each molecular sieve,<br>
in the catalyst composition has associated therewith at least one hydrogenation<br>
component, such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, chromium,<br>
manganese, a metal selected from Group IB, Iffi, HIE, FVB, VB, VIB, VII B, and<br>
VIIIB of the Periodic Table of the Elements (CAS version, 1979), or mixtures<br>
thereof. Useful Group VIHB metals include iron, ruthenium, osmium, nickel,<br>
cobalt, rhodium, indium, and noble metals such as platinum, rhenium, or<br>
palladium. Preferably, the hydrogenation component is palladium, platinum or<br>
rhenium.<br>
 [0040] The amount of the hydrogenation component is selected according to a<br>
balance between hydrogenation activity and catalytic functionality. Less of the<br>
hydrogenation component is required when the most active metals such as<br>
platinum are used as compared to palladium, which does not possess such strong<br>
hydrogenation activity. Generally, the catalyst composition contains less than 10<br>
wt% of the hydrogenation component and typically from 0.01 wt% to 2 wt% of<br>
said component.<br>
[0041] The hydrogenation component can be incorporated into the catalyst<br>
composition by co-crystallization, exchanged into the composition to the extent a<br>
Group IIIA element, e.g., aluminum, is in the molecular sieve structure,<br>
impregnated therein, or mixed with the molecular sieve and binder. Such<br>
component can be impregnated in or on the molecular sieve, for example in the<br>
case of platinum, by treating the molecular sieve with a solution containing a<br>
platinum metal-containing ion. Suitable platinum compounds for impregnating the<br>
catalyst with platinum include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various<br>
compounds containing the platinum ammine complex, such as PtCNHa^CIz.HbO.<br>
[0042] Alternatively, a compound of the hydrogenation component may be<br>
added to the molecular sieve when it is being composited with a binder, or after<br>
the molecular sieve and binder have been formed into particles by extrusion or<br>
palletizing.<br>
[0043] The hydrogenation component may also be arranged to have a<br>
hydrogenation activity of hydrogenation value of at least 300, such as at least 500,<br>
preferably at least 1000. The hydrogenation function is measured by comparing<br>
the amount of ethylene to the amount of ethane in the transalkylation product.<br>
Ethylene is formed in the transalkylation process by the dealkylation of ethylsubstituted<br>
aromatic molecules and by the cracking of aliphatic and naphthenic<br>
hydrocarbons. The hydrogenation component is designed to saturate these ethylene<br>
molecules to ethane before they can engage in side reactions. The better the<br>
hydrogenation component the less ethylene will be present relative to ethane in the<br>
transalkylation product. The hydrogenation value is defined as the ratio of ethane<br>
over ethylene. The experimental conditions of the test used herein include a<br>
constant temperature of 412°C, a pressure of 2170 kPAa, a hydrogen to<br>
hydrocarbon molar ratio of 2, a toluene/1,4-methylethylbenzene ratio of 2, and a<br>
WHSV of 2.7 h"1. The hydrogenation value, measured by ethane/ethylene ratio, is<br>
calculated by the molar percentage of ethane in the product divided by the molar<br>
percentage of ethylene in the product.<br>
[0044] After treatment with the hydrogenation component, the molecular sieve<br>
is usually dried by heating at a temperature of 65°C to 160°, typically 110 to<br>
143°C, for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 24 hours, at pressures<br>
ranging from 100 to 200 kPAa. Thereafter, the molecular sieve may be calcined in<br>
a stream of dry gas, such as air or nitrogen, at temperatures of from 260° to 650°C<br>
for 1 to 20 hours. Calcination is typically conducted at pressures ranging from 100<br>
to 300 kPAa and a WHSV of about 0.002 to about 20 h"1.<br>
[0045] Prior to use, steam treatment of the catalyst composition may be<br>
employed to minimize the aromatic hydrogenation activity of the catalyst<br>
composition. In the steaming process, the catalyst composition is usually contacted<br>
with from 5 to 100% steam, at a temperature of at least 260° to 650°C for at least<br>
one hour, specifically 1 to 20 hours, at a pressure of 100 to 2590 KPAa and a<br>
WHSV of about 0.002 to about 20 h'1.<br>
[0046] In addition, prior to contacting the catalyst composition with the<br>
hydrocarbon feed, the hydrogenation component can be sulfided. This is<br>
conveniently accomplished by contacting the catalyst with a source of sulfur, such<br>
as hydrogen sulfide, at a temperature ranging from about 320 to 480°C. The source<br>
of sulfur can be contacted with the catalyst via a carrier gas, such as hydrogen or<br>
nitrogen.<br>
[0047] After contacting the catalyst composition with the hydrocarbon feed,<br>
the catalyst may be deactivated due to coking or metal agglomerization. The<br>
deactivated catalyst can be regenerated conveniently by coke burning with a<br>
stream comprising oxygen or oxygen containing compounds, such as, ozone,<br>
oxochlorine, carbon disxide or the like, metal re-dispersing using oxdizationreduction<br>
cycle, oxochloride treatment or the like, washing with liquid<br>
hydrocarbons or aqueous solution of inorganic and/or organic chemical<br>
compounds, such as, water, ethanol, acetone, or the like, or rejuventaion with a<br>
stream comprising hydrogen. Regeneration or rejuventation can be performed at a<br>
temperature range from ambience to about 600°C, a pressure range of about 100 to<br>
about 5000 KPAa, and WHSV of about 0.2 to about 100 h"1.<br>
The Feed<br>
[0048] The aromatic feed used in the process of the invention comprises<br>
ethylbenzene and one or more aromatic compounds containing at least 9 carbon<br>
atoms. Specific €9+ aromatic compounds found in a typical feed include<br>
mesitylene (1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene),<br>
hemimellitene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene), pseudocumene (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene),<br>
1,2-methylethylbenzene, 1,3-methyl ethylbenzene, 1,4-methylethylbenzene, propylsubstituted<br>
benzenes, butyl-substituted benzenes, and dimethylethylbenzenes.<br>
Suitable sources of the Cg+ aromatics are any €9+ fraction from any refinery<br>
process that is rich in aromatics. This aromatics fraction contains a substantial<br>
proportion of Cg+ aromatics, e.g., at least 80 wt% Cg+ aromatics, wherein<br>
preferably at least 80 wt%, and more preferably more than 90 wt%, of the<br>
hydrocarbons will range from Cg to Cn- Typical refinery fractions which may be<br>
useful include catalytic reformate, FCC naphtha or TCC naphtha.<br>
[0049] The feed may also comprise benzene or toluene. Thus, in one practical<br>
embodiment, the feed to the transalkylation reactor comprises ethylbenzene, Cg+<br>
aromatics hydrocarbons and toluene. The feed may also include<br>
recycled/unreacted/produced benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and Cg+ aromatics<br>
that is obtained by distillation of the effluent product of the transalkylation<br>
reaction itself. Typically, toluene constitutes from about 5 to about 90 wt% and<br>
Cg+ constitutes from about 10 to about 95 wt%. In a typical light feed, toluene<br>
constitutes from about 40 to about 90 wt%, such as from 50 to 70 wt% of the<br>
entire feed, wheras the €9+ aromatics component constitutes from 10 to 60 wt%,<br>
such as from 30 to 50 wt%, of the entire feed to the transalkylation reaction zone.<br>
In a typical heavy feed, toluene constitutes from about 15 to about 50 wt%, such as<br>
from 25 to 40 wt% of the entire feed, wheras the €9+ aromatics component<br>
constitutes from 50 to 85 wt%, such as from 60 to 75 wt%, of the entire feed to the<br>
transalkylation reaction zone.<br>
Hydrocarbon Conversion Process<br>
[0050] The process can be conducted in any appropriate reactor including a<br>
radial flow, fixed bed, continuous flow or fluid bed reactor. The transalkylation<br>
reaction conditions typically include a temperature ranging from about 343° to<br>
about 510°C, such as from about 400° to about 454°C; a pressure from about 380<br>
to about 4240 kPAa, such as from about 1480 to about 3550 kPAa; a hydrogen to<br>
hydrocarbon molar ratio from about 1 to about 5, such as from about 1 to about 3<br>
and a WHSV of about 0.2 to about 20 h"1, such as from 1 to about 5 h"1. The<br>
transalkylation reaction conditions are sufficient to convert the heavy aromatic<br>
feed to a product containing substantial quantities of Ce-Cg aromatic compounds,<br>
such as benzene, toluene and xylenes, especially benzene and xylene. The<br>
transalkylation reaction conditions also are sufficient to convert the ethylbenzene<br>
in the feed to benzene and ethane.<br>
[0051] The invention will now be more particularly described with reference<br>
to the following Examples.<br>
Example 1 Catalyst Preparation<br>
[0052] A small crystal, high activity ZSM-12 was synthesized from a mixture<br>
comprising 11280 g of water, 1210 g of methyltriethylammonium chloride<br>
(MTEAC1), 1950 g of Ultrasil PM available from Degussa, 229 g of sodium<br>
aluminate solution (45%), and 364 g of 50% sodium hydroxide solution. The<br>
mixture had the following molar composition:<br>
 [0053] The mixture was reacted at 160°C in a 5-gal autoclave with stirring at<br>
150 RPM for 144 hours. The product was filtered, washed with deionized (DI)<br>
water and dried at 120°C. The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized material showed<br>
the typical pure phase of ZSM-12 topology. The SEM of the as-synthesized<br>
material showed that the material was composed of agglomerates of small crystals<br>
(with an average crystal size of about 0.05 microns).<br>
[0054] The as-synthesized crystals were converted into the hydrogen form by<br>
two ion exchanges with ammonium nitrate solution at room temperature, followed<br>
by drying at 120°C and calcination at 540°C for 6 hours. The resulting ZSM-12<br>
crystals had a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 44.98, an Alpha value of 500 and a D/r2<br>
for mesitylene of greater than 5000 x 10 "6 sec"1 at a temperature of 100°C and a<br>
mesitylene pressure of 2 torr.<br>
[0055] A mixture containing 65 wt% of the ZSM-12 produced as above, 15<br>
wt% ZSM-5, and 20 wt% alumina was extruded into pellets 1.3 mm in length and<br>
having a quadrulobe cross-section. The pellets were dried at 120°C then calcined<br>
in nitrogen for 3 hours at 480°C. This material was then exchanged with<br>
ammonium nitrate, dried at 120°C and then calcined in air for 6 hours at 540°C.<br>
0.5 wt% Re was then added to the catalyst by incipient wetness impregnation from<br>
an aqueous solution of tetraammine rhenium nitrate. The impregnated material<br>
was dried at 120°C then calcined in air for 6 hours at 350°C to produce a final<br>
catalyst.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0056] Three grams of the resultant catalyst composition from example 1 was<br>
used to effect transalkylation of a mixture of toluene/Cg* aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
mixture having the composition given in Table 1 at a temperature of about 412°C,<br>
a pressure of 2170 kPAa, a hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio of 2 and a WHSV<br>
of 2.7 h"1. The results after 4.4 days on stream are summarized in Table 1 below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0057] The results in Table 1 show that the catalyst of Example 1 was highly<br>
active, particularly for the de-ethylation rate of the ethylbenzene (de-ethylation<br>
rate of 98% and xylene/ethylbenzene ratio of 506). The results in Table 1 also<br>
show that the catalyst of Example 1 was highly active for Cg+ conversion to<br>
xylenes.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0058] Three grams of the resultant catalyst composition from example 1 was<br>
used to effect transalkylation of a mixture of toluene/C9+ aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
mixture having the composition given in Table 2 at a temperature of about 412°C,<br>
a pressure of 2170 kPAa, a hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratio of 2 and a WHSV<br>
of 2.7 h"1. The results after 4.4 days on stream are summarized in Table 2 below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 [0059] The results in Table 1 show that the catalyst of Example 1 was highly<br>
active, particularly for the de-ethylation rate of the ethylbenzene (de-ethylation<br>
rate of 98% and xylene/ethylbenzene ratio of 475). The results in Table 2 also<br>
show that the catalyst of Example 1 was highly active for Cg+ conversion to<br>
xylenes.<br>
