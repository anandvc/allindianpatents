				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a system and method tor<br>
providing internet telephony. In particular, the present invention relates<br>
to a system and method of providing a wireless internet telephone<br>
system over either a regular dial up telephone or a cable network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
One of the primary reasons for interest in offering Internet Protocol<br>
(IP)/internet telephony services is the pricing structures currently in<br>
place for the data service, and voice service offered by telephone<br>
operators. Long distance voice service can be thought of as "demand data"<br>
service, where the user pays a premium for the instantaneous access to a<br>
64 Kbps channel (voice grade channel in the US). Widely publicized,<br>
promotional type pricing for this service is on the order of $.10 a minute.<br>
By contrast, data service offered by telephone operators, such as that<br>
offered for a T-l connection (24 voice quality data lines, for a 1.544 Mbps<br>
connection) is priced at approximately $1000/month, which works out to<br>
$.001 a minute per voice line. In the very near future, cable operators<br>
will place extreme pressure on even the data service rates for telephone<br>
operators, as cable modem will allow cable operators to offer hundreds of<br>
Kbps effective throughput for approximately $50/month.<br>
The basic idea of IP/internet voice telephony is to digitize your<br>
voice as you talk on the phone and send the digitized data as IP<br>
packets to the Internet. An IP voice device can be embedded within<br>
an Internet connection device such as a modem, a set-top-box, or a<br>
computer. It can be also built as a stand alone product. The stand<br>
alone IP voice device, for example, may provide an Ethernet jack<br>
which can be connected with an Internet connection device and other<br>
LAN devices. The IP voice device may also include interfaces to<br>
connect regular phone handsets. The quality of speech heard through<br>
a normal telephone line requires 64kbits/s bandwidth. However, most<br>
current internet connections have less bandwidth, such as 28.8 Kbps.<br>
or 56 Kbps modem. Furthermore, even if a fast connection device is<br>
used, such as an ISDN, or Cable Modem, the Internet network itself is a<br>
shared medium and has limited bandwidth. Therefore, audio codecs<br>
are usually embedded to compress the voice data.<br>
To guarantee the interoperability between IP voice devices from<br>
different vendors, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)<br>
developed H.323 as the standard for telephony over IP network.<br>
H.323 defines common procedures for call setup, data compression,<br>
and data transport.<br>
In a general sense, IP telephony can be thought of as providing a<br>
"virtual" point to point connection for voice services over Internet. An<br>
IP voice device is basically a gateway to connect the regular telephone<br>
system to the Internet. The following example demonstrates how a<br>
call would be placed. A user in Indianapolis wants to call a friend in<br>
Paris. He picks up his IP voice device handset (or activates a virtual<br>
handset on a computer screen for a "built-in" version) and hears a<br>
dial-tone like a regular telephone dial-tone. Then, he dials his friend's<br>
Paris phone number. The call travels over the Internet to some<br>
Switching Server provided by the IP telephony service provider. The<br>
Switching Server will connect the call to his friend's IP voice device<br>
and initiates the call. If his friend has only a regular telephone, the<br>
Switching Server will connect the call to a gateway in Paris. The<br>
gateway in Paris then initiates a call over the public switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN) to the local Paris number. The cost to make<br>
phone calls between Indianapolis and Paris using two IP voice devices<br>
is only the Internet access fee. If one party uses a regular telephone,<br>
the extra charge is merely that of a local dial call.<br>
Depending on the Internet connection, there are at least two<br>
methods for making calls using an IP voice device: dial-up connections,<br>
and direct connections. With a dial-up connection, a user first calls an ISP<br>
(Internet service provider) over a regular dial-up line to set up an<br>
Internet connection. Then, he will use the IP voice device handset to dial<br>
the phone number of the person he is calling. The present applicants<br>
recognize one problem with this approach is that the recipient must be<br>
online waiting for the call. So, the sender may have to first call the<br>
recipient using a regular phone to make the appointment. With a direct<br>
connection, a user places a call using the IP voice device just as he does<br>
with the regular telephone. The direct connection indicates a permanent<br>
open channel to the Internet such as ISDN, or a cable access device. For a<br>
a dial-up connection call phone that has been called want ring unless<br>
the Internet connection is already established for this phone. Flora<br>
direct connection call, a phone would ring like a norrmal telephone.<br>
There are many advantages to IP/Internet telephony. One such<br>
advantage is reduced cost as described above. A low bit rate audio oodec<br>
embedded in the IP voice device enables voice calls over a 28.8.kbps<br>
modern. For a small reduction in voice quality, a person's monthly<br>
phone bill will be greatly reduced. If IP voice device used together with a<br>
cable modern, the private service network phis high bandwidth of the<br>
cable modern will provide very good sound quality. Even if the voice<br>
quality provided by a IP/Internet voice device is unsuitable for all phone<br>
communications, a IP/Internet voioe device may be useful as a second-<br>
in residential phone. Also, the H.323 standard supports several well<br>
defined, conference modes and, therefore, IP voice device is able to be<br>
used for multipoint oonference calls. A "wreb" dial-in service is<br>
advantageous for technical or customer support Unas because, for<br>
example, an Internet address of a company's IP voice device can be<br>
embedded in the company's web page and costomers can then call the<br>
company simply by "clicking on" that Internet address. The cost<br>
associated with toll-free (800" number) telephone numbers will be<br>
reduoed as a result.<br>
In addition, MSOs (cable television system operators) have recently<br>
become interested in adding inexpensive telephony services using a<br>
combination of an MBO's private HFC (Hybrid Fiber Coax} network and<br>
the public Internet. Voioe signals are converted to digital values and<br>
transported across the networks using various established and proposed<br>
Internet protocols as IP (Internet protocol packets.<br>
Rafcrenoe D1 (WO 97 29581 A) discloses a transmission system,<br>
which enables users to have a voice conversation via the Internet. D1<br>
utilises the PSTN to connect with an internet service provider. The<br>
system disclosed by D1 includes transmitting a telephone call to the<br>
PSTN and an originating voice engine, which oompresses the signal for<br>
internet to a receiving voice engine. The receiving voice engine<br>
decompresses and demodulates the received signal and provides the<br>
signal to the PSTN (31). The PSTN compresses the signal into a format<br>
for transmission therealong for receipt by a receiving telephone. This<br>
system compresses and decompresses a signal into a format suitable for<br>
transmission by the PSTN. Furthermore, the compression and<br>
decompression of the signal is performed at the PSTN, remotely from the<br>
ends of the established communication channe. Thus, although this<br>
system eliminates most long distance charges associated with a voice<br>
call, there are still local charges associated therewith and possibly long<br>
distance charges on either side of the communication channel associated<br>
with contacting the internet service provider.<br>
Reference D2 WO 98 11703 was published 19 March 1998.<br>
However, there are also problems associated with existing<br>
IP/ Internet telephony systems. For example, the above-described<br>
systems involve some combination of additional or revised POTS (Plain<br>
Old Telephone System) wiring, additional or revised cable network wiring,<br>
or additional network interface boxes. In addition, any connection which<br>
replaces a PSTN (public switched telephone network) service (such as<br>
reuse of the existing POTS wiring within the home to replace PSTN<br>
services with HFC telephony services) may be required to supply so<br>
called life-line" services. Some of these options require professional<br>
installation which may be costly, time consuming, and inconvenient for<br>
the user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention resides, in part, in recognition of the above-described<br>
problems and, in part, in providing a system and method for solving these<br>
problems. In particular, the inventors recognize that the described<br>
problems are solved by providing a voice call over an Internet connection<br>
by receiving a signal from a cable network. The signal represents internet<br>
protocol data packets of the voice call and is both modulated in a first<br>
format and compressed to match a format of the cable network. The<br>
signal is demodulated and decompressed. The signal is next compressed<br>
into a format of a home environment, modulated into a second format and<br>
wirelessly transmitted to a wireless device. The signal is then<br>
demodulated and decompressed in the wireless device. The inventors also<br>
provide a system including the elements necessary to carry out this<br>
method.<br>
An aspect of the present invention involves providing an internet<br>
telephony system using a wireless connection such as via the<br>
unregulated 900 MHz cordless phone spectrum or other spectrum<br>
allocated for wireless communications to provide an RF link between an<br>
IP connection device, a network interface box or set-top box; and one or<br>
more wireless handsets. A processing/ control element in the network<br>
interface box would run the required IP protocols to establish and<br>
manage call set-up and teardown (currently defined within ITU-T H.323),<br>
translate the digital voice signal between IP and the local RF link<br>
protocol, and provide the RF base station function for the handsets).<br>
Each handset would incorporate the other end of the RF link, and A/ D<br>
and D/A functions to convert the voice signal to and from digital packets,<br>
and potentially apply some compression algorithm to improve bandwidth<br>
utilization. In a handset design which does not incorporate enough<br>
processing power to perform the compression function, this function<br>
could potentially reside in the network interface box.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves a machanism to<br>
establish a wireless interface to a telephone handset through a settop<br>
box that is tied into a cable network such as a hybrid coaxial cable<br>
network.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves using a standard<br>
protocol such as the Internet Protocol to maintain a digital connection<br>
into a cable network while using an RF link to transmit compressed<br>
voice/data information between a telephone device such as a telephone<br>
handset and an interface unit such as a settop box.<br>
Aspects of the present invention also involve providing for<br>
eliminating the need to add wiring, such as POTS wiring, to accommodate<br>
one or more handsets, or alternatively eliminating the need to add<br>
multiple cable drops and adapters such as POTS/HFC adapters. A<br>
wireless feature in accordance with aspects of the invention provides for<br>
coupling a network interface box to an existing cable outlet and for<br>
adding handsets as required without installation of additional outlets. In<br>
addition, aspects of the invention provide for multi-line Internet phone<br>
calls without rewiring. Another aspect of the invention involves adding<br>
an analog trunk interface wherein an IP voice device can be connected to<br>
a PBX device for providing an Internet PBX. For example, a user could<br>
dial a prefix, such as "9" to make a regular outside phone call, or dial a<br>
different prefix, such as "8" to make an Internet phone call.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an IP<br>
voice device or a set top box provides for connecting to external<br>
equipment, such as a PC or Workstation, and utilization of computation<br>
power of external devices for providing additional features such as IP<br>
FAX service or video conferencing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
The invention may be better understood by referring to the<br>
accompanying drawing in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows, in block diagram form, an embodiment of a system<br>
incorporating aspects of the invention; and<br>
Figures 2 through 7 show, in block diagram form, embodiments of<br>
portions of the system shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 8 is a flow chart illustrating a method of operation according<br>
to the principles of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In Figure 1, a system constructed in accordance with aspects of the<br>
invention comprises a PSTN network and a cable network coupled to a<br>
cable modem termination system. The PSTN Network and/or Cable<br>
Network provide alternative paths for coupling the system shown to the<br>
Internet, e.g., to an Internet service provider (ISP). The cable modem<br>
termination system is coupled to a gateway, such as in a home<br>
environment, that comprises a cable modem network interface and first<br>
and second codecs for coupling to a conventional wired telephone via a<br>
subscriber line interface unit and/or to a wireless telephone unit via an<br>
RF modem interface, respectively.<br>
Data transmission between the various units shown in Figure 1<br>
occurs as follows. Data transmission between the PSTN network and the<br>
cable modem termination system shown in Figure 1 (path 1 in Figure 1)<br>
may occur in 64 Kbps/voice line format or in Tl or higher hierarchy.<br>
Data in the cable network (e.g., path 2 between the cable network and the<br>
cable modem termination system in Figure 1, or path 2 between the cable<br>
modem termination system and the cable modem network interface unit<br>
in the gateway in Figure 1) may be carried over TCP/IP compressed at<br>
various rates or uncompressed linear at 64 Kbps/voice line. Data<br>
transmission between the cable modem network interface and the first<br>
codec (path 3 in Figure 1) may occur in linear PCM format at 64<br>
Kbps/voice line. Data transmission between the cable modem network<br>
interface and the second codec (path 4 in Figure 1) may occur in linear<br>
format at 64 Kbps/voice line or compressed at various rates. Data<br>
communication on path 5 in Figure 1 (between the first codec and the<br>
subscriber line interface unit) may be in companded format at 64<br>
Kbps/voice line. Data communication via path 6 in Figure 1 (between the<br>
second codec and the RF modem interface) may be in linear format at 64<br>
Kbps/voice line or in compressed format at various rates. Data<br>
communicated to and from the subscriber line interface unit (path 7 in<br>
Figure 1) may occur in analog format (e.g., for an RJ11 connector) and<br>
data communicated to and from the RF modem interface (path 8 in Figure<br>
1) may occur in RF digital modulation format.<br>
In embodiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3, IP telephony compression<br>
algorithms, call setup, and a cordless telephone adapter are incorporated<br>
into an IP connection device or a client server. An example of an<br>
embodiment of such a device is a device referred to as a Network<br>
Computer (NC) which is a computer similar to a personal computer (PC)<br>
that is intended primarily for providing an interface to the Internet. That<br>
is, a network computer is intended primarily to provide computing power<br>
and features sufficient, for example, to connect to the internet, execute<br>
web browser software and provide email capability. A cordless telephone<br>
adapter in accordance with aspects of the invention would allow the<br>
convenience to call from any room in a house without expensive rewiring.<br>
The phone would ring only when there is an incoming IP phone call, and<br>
would present dial tone, etc. when used to place a call.<br>
Two exemplary embodiments of an IP connection device having<br>
a cordless phone interface are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The system<br>
shown in Figure 2 utilizes an analog cordless telephone interface such<br>
as CT-1 (46/49 MHz). The system shown in Figure 3 uitlizes a digital<br>
900 MHz spread spectrum cordless telephone interface. The analog<br>
cordless IP voice device may provide a lower cost solution. However, a<br>
digital 900 MHz cordless IP voice device may be more advantageous in<br>
terms of voice quality and expandability. For example, a digital<br>
cordless phone typically provides better voice quality due to the noise<br>
cancelling capability of the digital system and a digital cordless IP<br>
voice device may have more than one handset. Also, a cordless IP<br>
voice device such as that shown in Figure 2 and/or 3 may be used for<br>
data service when used together with wireless modem.<br>
The systems shown in Figures 2 and 3 may include a voice codec<br>
for compressing and decompressing the voice data if the modem of the<br>
IP connection device is running at low speeds. Table 1 lists some<br>
popular standard voice codec algorithms and their associated data<br>
rates.<br>
Table 1 Voice compression standards<br>
Figure 2 shows a client server device including IP voice features<br>
which, for example, may be included on an IP voice adapter card<br>
included in the client server device. The IP voice feature includes a<br>
CT-1 subsystem comprising RF transmitter circuitry Tx and receiver<br>
circuitry Rx, a programmable PLL synthesizer, a baseband (audio)<br>
processor, and a microprocessor interface. The components Tx and Rx<br>
and the PPL synthesizer are used to modulate and demodulate RF<br>
signals for transmission and reception of the wireless telephone<br>
signals. A duplexer is used to separate the transmit and receive paths<br>
of the RF communications. As discussed before, a PCM codec<br>
integrated with filters may be needed to provide A/D and D/A<br>
conversions and compression, as well as the transmit and receive<br>
filtering of the signals. The digital signal processing (DSP) unit may be,<br>
for example, an integrated circuit (IC) that implements the voice codec<br>
under the control of the CPU (central processing unit) which may be a<br>
microprocessor. The CPU provides the central control of the wireless<br>
IP interface device shown in Fig. 2. The CPU is connected to the<br>
various components of the device via a data control bus. The CPU has<br>
a built in memory for storing the required control codes, including<br>
implementation of the H.323 standards and the TCP/UDP/IP protocols.<br>
Figure 3 shows another exemplary IP connection device having a<br>
digital cordless phone interface such as a 900 Mhz interface. A<br>
baseband device usually includes a spread-spectrum modem, an audio<br>
engine (PCM, DTMF, etc.), a voice codec, and a microcontroller. The<br>
components Tx and Rx and the PLL synthesizer are used to modulate<br>
and demodulate RF signals for transmission and reception of the<br>
wireless telephone signals, to and from the wireless handset. A<br>
duplexer is used to separate the transmit and receive paths of the RF<br>
communications. A DSP unit is used to implement the voice codec<br>
under the control of the CPU. The CPU, or central processor, provides<br>
the central control of the wireless IP interface device as shown in Fig.<br>
3. The CPU is connected to the various components of the device via a<br>
data control bus. The CPU has a built in memory for storing the<br>
required control codes, including impelmentation of the H.323<br>
standards and the TCP/UDP/IP protocols.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a wireless internet<br>
telephony system to be connected to a cable network. A network<br>
architecture in accordance with the principles of the present invention is<br>
shown in Figure 4.<br>
In Figure 4, an interface to cable network(100) comprises a cable<br>
modem termination in the physical layer that has a bi-directional channel<br>
connected to the hybrid fiber coax network (105). The physical layer<br>
modulation scheme may comprise, for example, Quadrature Amplitude<br>
Modulation (QAM). The transport mechanism may comprise TCP/IP. In<br>
order to enable the voice application over the cable modem, the network<br>
interface unit may employ a protocol such as H.323 over TCP/IP. This<br>
enables signaling, call set up and other functions. The voice (fax and<br>
analog modem is included in this paradigm) data itself may be carried in<br>
a compressed or uncompressed format. For example, companded voice<br>
data at 64 Kbps can be carried over the cable network embedded in<br>
TCP/IP packets. Alternatively, it may be compressed using one of many<br>
voice compression methods and carried over the cable network<br>
embedded in TCP/IP packets. Certain types of data cannot be compressed<br>
(example fax or analog modem) and need to be carried in a linear format.<br>
Figure 4 also depicts a wireless interface (104) to a plurality of<br>
handsets or receiver devices (101, 102, 103...). The protocol between the<br>
base device (100) and the handsets may be entirely proprietary or some<br>
standard interface. Additionally, the data format or voice (compressed in<br>
one of many possible algorithms or uncompressed) may be different in<br>
the RF network as compared to the format in which the voice was carried<br>
over the HFC network.<br>
Advantages associated with maintaining the same data format (e.g.,<br>
compression scheme) in the wired (cable) and wireless network are:<br>
1. only a single encoding/decoding process is necessary which, in a home<br>
environment, can take place at the wireless handset or mobile terminal<br>
(multiple transcoding processes normally result in degradation of the<br>
original source material); and<br>
2. the base station (e.g., in the home) is transparent to the data from the<br>
handset or mobile terminal.<br>
An advantage associated with maintaining different data formats<br>
(e.g., compression scheme) in the wired (cable) and wireless network is<br>
that certain compressed formats are specifically suited to be carried over<br>
certain transmission channels. Channel errors, depending on how they<br>
occur, can cause different degradation to the source material depending<br>
on the compression scheme that is employed. The wired and wireless<br>
environments are very different in terms of channel characteristics.<br>
Therefore, tailoring the coding scheme to match the characteristics of the<br>
channels may have some benefits in the overall system design.<br>
Figure 5 shows further details of an exemplary embodiment of<br>
cable set-top box (100) in Figure 4. The cable channel (91) that carries<br>
both downstream and upstream data is usually frequency division<br>
multiplexed to enable simultaneous channels of operation. Further,<br>
within a specific channel, due to the nature of the shared cable medium.<br>
multiple users may signal using a time division multiplexed access<br>
mechanism. This task is coordinated by the head end.<br>
The cable interface (40) is a network interface unit (NIU)<br>
comprising of a modulator/demodulator pair and a processing unit for<br>
interpreting the incoming data stream and messages. One of the<br>
transport mechanisms employed is TCP/IP. The NIU receives data,<br>
demodulates decodes and extracts the information pertaining to specific<br>
voice channels in this application. It is also responsible for maintaining<br>
signaling information with the external network (for example using the<br>
H.323 protocol stack or any other commonly used signaling stack used in<br>
telephony). Additional features such as caller ID, messaging, voice mail<br>
etc. are features that are supported by the NIU. This is enabled by its<br>
interface with the Caller ID block (50), the external digital signal<br>
processor (10) with an embedded microprocessor (5) that coordinates the<br>
task of messaging, and voice compression/decompression as necessary.<br>
The incoming messages are stored in compressed or uncompressed,<br>
format in the message memory(60). Other system architectures may be<br>
used wherein the messages are stored in message memory in yet another<br>
compressed format to increase the time over which messages can be<br>
, stored in a given amount of available memory. This task of additional<br>
compression/decompression may take place in DSP unit 10. The code<br>
memory (70) contains the code for the DSP engine. The RF cordless<br>
circuitry (20) is responsible for communicating with the handsets or<br>
mobile terminals and exchange specific information intended for each<br>
device. In addition to the exchange of data, 20 is also responsible for<br>
exchanging signaling and status information. The system shown in Figure<br>
5 includes a common bus (80) between the functional components for<br>
data exchange, but a generalized architecture need not be limited to the<br>
bus structure shown in Figure 5. Additionally, messaging information<br>
and caller ID information are exchanged between 100 and the handsets or<br>
mobile terminals through the RF/cordless circuitry.<br>
Figure 6 shows an exemplary embodiment of the receiver/set-top<br>
box 100 described earlier in regard to Figure 4 and referred to as unit<br>
700 in regard to Figure 6. The transmit and receive signals into the cable<br>
network through the RF connector (796) are kept isolated using a<br>
diplexer (795). The cable tuner (705) and demodulator (710) convert the<br>
digitally modulated signal (for example QAM) into a composite digital bit<br>
stream which is delivered to a Medium Access Control - MAC (720) block<br>
that performs the task of separating information into logical transport<br>
streams. Additionally, unit 720 is responsible for synchronizing with the<br>
cable head end in order to provide the settcp box access control to the<br>
common cable medium for return channel information. The burst<br>
modulator (740) and power amplifier(730) create and send data in the<br>
return channel path back into the cable network.<br>
The RF processing chain for processing the digital information from<br>
the cable network starts with the interface, or input/output (I/O) unit<br>
(760) which may be implemented as an application specific integrated<br>
circuit (ASIC) and which interfaces with a cordless phone processing unit<br>
(750), that also may be part of an ASIC or a separate ASIC, to create<br>
individual links with handsets or mobile receivers. Unit 750 is coupled to<br>
memory units DRAM 765 and ROM 770 for receiving stored processing<br>
instructions and for temporary data storage during processing. The data<br>
intended for each individual handset or mobile receiver may be time<br>
slotted, modulated and sent on the RF link through the RF connector<br>
(797). Additional information streams processed by the MAC processing<br>
block (720) may be directed to an ethernet port (783) through an<br>
ethernet controller (781) or an USB (Universal Serial Bus) port (784)<br>
through an USB controller (785) or an RS232 interface (791) through an<br>
RS232 driver(790).<br>
The various functions shown in Figure 6 are connected to bus 721<br>
for communication of data and control information between the functions<br>
and between the functions and CPU 786 which controls the operation of<br>
the functions in device 700. Also coupled to bus 721 are memory units<br>
775 and 780 for storing control programs and data for CPU 786 and other<br>
functions in device 700. Power for unit 700 is provided by power supply<br>
792. Also, while many of the processing blocks shown in Figure 6 may be<br>
optional depending on the specific application or product, the system<br>
shown in Figure 6 illustrates the composite nature of the data coming<br>
over the cable system. The path for the voice channels are of particular<br>
interest in regard to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a block diagram of an implementation of a wireless<br>
handset 101. The handset 101 comprises a DSP unit 201 including a<br>
microprocessor 210, a speaker, earpiece, RF circuitry and a keypad.<br>
The microprocessor 210 controls the various components of the wireless<br>
handset 101 via a system bus 202. The RF circuitry is connected to a RF<br>
antenna for transmitting and receiving RF wireless signals. A keypad 204<br>
is used for an user to dial a phone number and for controlling other<br>
functions of the wireless phone. The DSP converts the analog signal into a<br>
digital signal to be transmitted over the RF spectrum if a digital<br>
| transmission system is used. Memory 203 stores the program codes to be<br>
executed by the microprocessor 210.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown<br>
and described herein are illustrations only and that various modifications<br>
may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from<br>
the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
Figure 8 shows a flow chart illustrating a method of operation<br>
according to the principles of the present invention. At step 802, a signal<br>
is received by, for example, by the cable interface 40 of unit 100. This<br>
signal is demodulated by cable interface 40 into a demodulated signal at<br>
step 803. The unit may decide to further compress or decompress this<br>
demodulated signal under the control of the DSP unit 10 as described<br>
before. The DSP then causes this signal to be further modulated at step<br>
805 by the RF/Cordless circuitry 20. This further modulated signal is<br>
then transmitted wirelessly to a wireless unit, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig. 7. After receiving this further modulated signal at the wireless unit,<br>
the wireless unit then demodulates this signal for completion of the IP<br>
voice call.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown<br>
and described herein are illustrations only and that various modifications<br>
may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from<br>
the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
