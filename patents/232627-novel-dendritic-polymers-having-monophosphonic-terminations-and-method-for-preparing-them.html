NOVEL DENDRITIC POLYMERS HAVING MONOPHOSPHONIC TERMINATIONS, METHOD FOR PREPARING THEM, AND THEIR USE<br>
Dendritic polymers are macromolecules composed of monomers which combine according to a branching process around a central multifunctional core.<br>
Dendritic polymers, also called "cascade molecules", are highly branched functional polymers of defined structure. Those macromolecules are, in fact, polymers because they are based on the combination of repeating units. However, dendritic polymers are fundamentally different from conventional polymers in that they have their own properties due to their branched structure. The molecular weight and the form of dendritic polymers can be controlled precisely, and all the functions are situated at the termination of the branches, forming a surface, which renders them readily accessible.<br>
Dendritic polymers are constructed step by step by the repetition of a reaction sequence, allowing each repeating unit and the terminal functions to be multiplied. Each reaction sequence forms a so-called "new generation". The branched structure is obtained by the repetition of a reaction sequence, which allows a new generation and an increasing number of identical branches to be obtained at the end of each reaction cycle. After several generations, the dendritic polymer generally assumes a globular form which is highly branched and multifunctionalised by virtue of the large number of terminal functions present at the periphery.<br>
Such polymers have been described especially by Launay et a/., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. EngL, 1994, 33, 15/16, 1589-1592, or by Launay et a/., Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 1997, 529, 51-58.<br>
The treatment of surfaces, for example in order to protect them, involves the phenomenon of adhesion, which often requires the presence of hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups on the surface and/or the protecting agent. It is therefore desirable to provide agents that have a high hydrogen-bond capacity as surface-treatment agents.<br>
Owing to their structure, dendritic polymers exhibit a high density of terminations and therefore a high functional density at their periphery. It has<br><br>
therefore been envisaged to prepare functional dendritic polymers permitting the creation of hydrogen bonds with the aim of using them as surface-treatment agents.<br>
The phosphonic acid function is particularly favourable for the formation of hydrogen bonds. It is therefore desirable to prepare dendritic polymers having phosphonic acid-functional terminations.<br>
Dendritic polymers having various phosphorus-containing functions (phosphine, phosphinate, phosphate, phosphonate, phosphorane, spirophosphorane) have been described especially in the articles mentioned above or in French patent application FR 95 06 281.<br>
However, no dendritic polymer having free phosphonic acid terminations, or optionally terminations in the form of salts or of the corresponding methyl ester, has been described. In fact, it has hitherto been impossible to prepare such functionalities on dendritic polymers. More precisely, it was impossible to prepare dendritic polymers exhibiting a phosphonic acid function starting from the corresponding alkyl esters. This has now been made possible starting from the corresponding methyl ester.<br>
The inventors have now found a reaction that allows that type of terminal functionality of the methyl ester or phosphonic acid type to be obtained on dendritic polymers.<br>

n represents the generation of the dendritic polymer in question; it represents an<br>

Most frequently, the dendritic polymers of the invention comprise intermediate chains terminated by a terminal group:<br>
-	at the end of each generation chain that may be present; or<br>
-	at the end of each bond around the core that is not connected to a<br>
-	generation chain.<br>
The dendritic polymers of the invention accordingly generally comprise m arms linked to the central core §, each of those arms being:<br>
-	an arm of type (1), that is to say an arm constituted by an intermediate<br>
-	chain terminated by a terminal group of formula (T); or<br>

Trimethylsilane bromide (1.72 mmol, 229 μl) is then added slowly at 0°C, and the whole returns slowly to ambient temperature over a period of 6 hours. Anhydrous methanol (1 ml) is then added. After 2 hours' stirring, the reaction mixture is dried under reduced pressure. Then the powder is suspended in a minimal amount of water for 30 minutes with vigorous stirring. After filtration, the product is dried and then washed with copious amounts of ether. Preferably, in order to obtain a soluble dendritic polymer, the final dendritic polymer must not be totally desolvated. The final product is isolated in a final yield of 51%.<br><br>

Tetraisopropyl-methylene gem-diphosphonate (3 mmol) and sodium hydride (3 mmol, 75 mg) are dissolved in 2 ml of distilled THF. The solution is stirred vigorously for 2 hours at ambient temperature. When the evolution of hydrogen has ceased, the solution is added slowly to the dendritic polymer Gc', (0.17 mmol, 500 mg), which has previously been dissolved in 3 ml of distilled THF. The addition is carried out at 0°C, and then the mixture is allowed to return to ambient temperature overnight. The white solid is then washed with a pentane/ether mixture 1/1 in order to remove the excess tetraisopropyl-methylene gem-diphosphonate.

Example 11 : Synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzyl dimethyl-phosphonate<br>
Steps a) to d) of this multi-step synthesis have already been described by J.D. Olsjewski et al. J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 4285-4296.<br>
a)	Synthesis of 4-tert-butvldimethvlsilvl-benzaldehvde<br><br>
4-Hydroxy-benzaldehyde (10 g, 0.082 mol) is dissolved in 100 ml of dichloromethane. There are added to that solution, at ambient temperature, chlorotrimethylsilane (11.72 g, 0.078 mol) as well as dimethylaminopyridine (1 g, 0.008 mol) and triethylamine (23 ml, 0.164 mol). The whole is left at ambient temperature for 48 hours with magnetic stirring, and then the solvent is evaporated off under reduced pressure. The resulting solid is stirred in pure pentane (3 x 200 ml), and the silylated product is extracted in that manner.<br>
b)	Synthesis of 4-tert-butvldimethvlsilvl-benzaldehvde<br><br>
4-Tert-butyldimethylsilyl-benzaldehyde (28 g, 0.118 mol) is dissolved in a THF/ethanol mixture (50 ml/10 ml). Sodium borohydride (9 g, 0.237 mol) is added to that solution at ambient temperature, and the suspension is stirred under argon and at ambient temperature for 4 days. All the solvents are then evaporated off from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure, and a very compact white gel is thus obtained. The gel is suspended in ether, and then a saturated ammonium hydrochloride solution is added very slowly until a more homogeneous solution is obtained in both phases. When both phases are homogeneous, the final product is separated off by simple water/ether decantation. The ethereal phase is evaporated off and then the resulting product is taken up in pentane and washed once with water.<br><br>
c)	Synthesis of 4-tert-butvldimethvlsilvl-benzaldehvde<br>
i i<br>
Benzyl alcohol (27 g, 0.113 mol) is dissolved in THF (100 ml); trifluoroacetic anhydride (19.2 ml, 0.136 mol) is added to that solution at ambient temperature. The whole is then heated at the reflux temperature of THF for one hour. The mixture is then allowed to return slowly to ambient temperature, and 75% of the THF is evaporated off; the whole is then taken up in ether and washed firstly with a sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 100 ml) and once with water (100 ml).<br>
d)	Synthesis of 4-tert-butvldimethvlsilvl-benzaldehyde<br><br>
Trifluoroacetate (35 g, 0.105 mol) is dissolved in THF (100 ml); lithium bromide (11 g, 0.126 mol) is added to that solution, and the whole is heated at the reflux temperature of THF for 18 hours. The THF is evaporated off under reduced pressure, and then the product is taken up in 40 ml of acetonitrile and decantation is carried out with hexane (4 x 100 ml). The hexane is evaporated off and a whitish oil containing white crystals is obtained. It is then necessary to recover the oil using hexane again but filtering off the crystals. The product is isolated in a yield of 84%.<br>
e)	Synthesis of 4 -tert-butyldimethylsilyl-benzyl dimethyl-phosphonate<br><br>
4-Tert-butyldimethylsiloxane benzyl bromide (2.72 mmol, 800 mg) is added to trimethyl phosphite (4 mmol, 0.47 ml). The trimethyl phosphite is added in several portions: the first equivalent (0.32 ml) is added first, and then the whole is heated to 80°C, with stirring and without solvent. The reaction liberates methyl bromide,<br><br>
which must be removed in order for the reaction to be complete. After heating at<br>
reflux for 4 hours, the excess trimethyl phosphite (0.15 ml) is added. The reaction<br>
mixture is again heated at 80°C for 2 hours. The final mixture contains traces of<br>
dimethyl phosphite, which can be removed under reduced pressure at 80°C, as<br>
well as methyl-dimethyl phosphite, which is a by-product due to the formation of<br>
methyl bromide.<br>

f) Synthesis of 4-hydroxybenzyl dimethyl-phosphonate<br><br>
4-Hydroxybenzyl dimethyl-phosphonate (2.72 mmol) is dissolved in 5 ml of anhydrous THF, and then tetrabutylammonium fluoride in 1 M anhydrous solution in THF is added (5.4 mmol, 5.5 ml). The mixture is left at ambient temperature for 48 hours. Several drops of water are added to the reaction mixture after one hour's stirring the product is washed with pentane. The product is then purified by filtration over silica, first using a solventpure ether gradient and then using a pentane/THF mixture 1/1.<br>
The final product is recrystallised from dichloromethane; to that end, it is dissolved in a minimal amount of hot dichloromethane and then allowed to return very slowly to ambient temperature and finally, at -20°C, the product is recovered in totally pure form, in the form of white crystals. 31P-{1H} NMR (CDCI3):δ=32.4 (s, P) ppm.<br>

The first generation dendritic polymer having dichlorothiophosphine ends Gc1 (0.109 mmol, 200 mg) is dissolved in THF (2 ml); cesium carbonate (2.6 mmol, 853 mg) is added to that solution. Finally, 4-hydroxy-benzyl dimethyl-phosphonate is added (1.3 mmol, 282 mg). The mixture is stirred for 24 hours at ambient temperature. The sample is then placed in vacuo until a white powder is obtained, which powder is washed with a pentane/ether mixture (1/1). The final product is isolated in a final yield of 73%.<br>

Example 27 : Lubricating properties<br>
The compounds according to the invention were tested in a Falex lubrication test (rupture test) with steel/steel contact. This test demonstrated that the functionalised biphosphonate dendritic polymers of the invention can be used as an extreme pressure lubrication additive. Such additives, diluted at 1%, allow a level of lubrication to be obtained that is equal or superior to that of an alkyl phosphate ester, which is often used as a lubrication additive.<br><br><br>
