				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to the administration of drugs to a patient and in particular to<br>
their transdermal administration, without the use of a syringe. The term "drug" is<br>
used to refer to any biologically active substance that needs to be delivered into the<br>
bloodstream of the patient, whether therapeutic or not, for example pharmaceuticals,<br>
vaccines and proteins. The patient may be human or animal.<br>
Background<br>
The topical administration of drugs was historically limited to the treatment of<br>
wounds and other conditions restricted to the external parts of the body. The first<br>
transdermal patch based drug delivery system to be marketed was the Transderm<br>
Scop™ patch in 1979. Nicotine patches are a more recent example and indicative of<br>
the popularity of transdermal systems and their widespread acceptance as drug<br>
delivery systems.<br>
Delivery of drugs via the transdermal route has several advantages over more<br>
conventional routes such as oral and intravenous or intramuscular. These are listed as<br>
follows:<br>
•	Ability to achieve sustained blood drug concentrations, over prolonged periods<br>
of up to a week.<br>
•	Predictable pharmacokinetic profiles can be achieved without the sometimes<br>
extreme fluctuations that are an inherent part of oral drug delivery.<br>
•	Discontinuation of therapy can be effected immediately upon removal of the<br>
transdermal system.<br>
•	Very easy to self-administer compared to intravenous or intramuscular routes,<br>
which require qualified nurse or physician to administer.<br>
•	The first-pass effect - metabolism of the drug during its passage through the<br>
liver prior to entering the systemic circulation - is avoided.<br><br>
•	It is a non-invasive mode of drug delivery.<br>
•	Patient activity is not restricted by use of most transdermal systems.<br>
•	Improved patient compliance due to reduced frequency of administration.<br>
•	Drugs inactivated by gastrointestinal enzymes or gastrointestinal pH, (e.g.,<br>
estrogens, testosterone, nitroglycerin) can be delivered directly into systemic<br>
circulation using the transdermal route.<br>
•	Reduced side-effects associated with direct delivery into the systemic<br>
circulation, and low delivery dose.<br>
Passive Drug Delivery Mechanisms<br>
The vast majority of marketed transdermal drug delivery systems are based on the<br>
passive diffusion of drug molecules through the skin. There have been two main<br>
approaches to transdermal systems utilizing passive diffusion, these being the drug-in-<br>
adhesive, and the reservoir system. The primary difference between the two systems<br>
is that in the reservoir system the drug is loaded in a membrane in the form of a drug<br>
reservoir, and must diffuse through the adhesive layer prior to reaching the stratum<br>
corneum which it must then penetrate before diffusing through to the capillaries and<br>
blood vessels. In the case of the drug-in-adhesive, the drug is loaded into the adhesive<br>
layer as well as the reservoir. This eliminates any distance between the drug and the<br>
stratum corneum, providing a burst effect and immediate release of drug.<br>
In such systems, passage of drug is dependent on the permeability coefficient which is<br>
a function of the resistance to drug diffusion. The resistance itself is a function of the<br>
three layers of the skin, the stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis, and the<br>
vehicle/polymer within which the drug is contained. This may be shown<br>
mathematically as follows:<br><br>
where Dk is the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the stratum corneum;<br>
and d is the thickness of the stratum corneum.<br><br>
The resistance occurs in series and the total resistance is the sum of the individual<br>
resistance offered by the drug loaded vehicle, and each of the three layers of the skin.<br>
The total permeability is therefore inversely proportional to the sum of the individual<br>
resistances.<br>
Given the relationship and the permeability of the layers of the skin discussed above,<br>
it follows that small drug molecules (hydrophilic or lipophilic) are the most likely<br>
candidates for delivery via the skin through passive delivery. In order to explore how<br>
a broader range of therapeutic molecules may be delivered through the skin it is first<br>
necessary to understand the anatomy of the skin, and its barrier properties.<br>
The human skin is made up of three primary layers, the epidermis, dermis and<br>
hypodermis. The epidermis is the external surface of the skin, composed primarily of<br>
keratinocytes which differentiate into four layers: basal layer, spinos layer, granular<br>
layer and surface layer. The surface layer is also known as the stratum corneum and<br>
this is the front line defence between the human and its external environment.<br>
The dermis is composed of two layers, the papillary dermis, and reticular dermis. The<br>
dermis generally consists of cellular and fibrous components, involved in cell<br>
synthesis, and collagen synthesis for tensile strength, and elastic fibre synthesis which<br>
imparts deformable properties to the skin.<br>
The hypodermis contains adipose (fat) tissue, and its primary function is to attach<br>
dermis to the underlying tissues. Skin appendages originate in the epidermal region,<br>
but extend into the dermis. These include hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and arrector<br>
pilli muscle (the latter responsible for the erection of hair follicles), and sweat glands.<br>
The skin has numerous functions. These are protection, sensation, heat regulation,<br>
formation of a mechanical and immunological defence, synthesis of vitamin D in<br>
response to UV exposure, pigmentation for UV protection, and involvement in wound<br>
healing.<br><br>
The skin's protective barrier is composed of a combination of the proteins and lipids<br>
that form the stratum corneum, the outermost layer. This layer is continuously shed<br>
and regenerated, and provides protection against the entry of water, chemicals,<br>
bacteria and fungi. It follows therefore that this is the most important layer with<br>
respect to the delivery of drugs transdermally, in that it provides a barrier against the<br>
penetration of drugs. The barrier is in the form of 15-20 layers of flat, partially<br>
desiccated, dead, keratinised epidermal cells. The thickness of this layer ranges from<br>
10 to 20 µm depending on the region of the body, with the thickest layers being on the<br>
palms of the hands and soles of the feet. This barrier is in fact a more formidable<br>
barrier to drug delivery than the epithelial barriers of the gastrointestinal, nasal,<br>
buccal, vaginal or rectal delivery routes. In addition, at the surface of the skin there<br>
are debris, micro-organisms, sebum and other materials, but these present an<br>
insignificant barrier to drug penetration.<br>
The stratum corneum barrier is composed of approximately 40% lipids, 40% protein<br>
and 20% water. The lipid rich nature precludes the transport of hydrophilic and<br>
charged molecules, and facilitates the transport of lipophilic molecules. The structure<br>
is analogous to a brick and mortar wall with the hydrated protein making up the<br>
bricks, and lipids making up the mortar. Despite the above barrier to drug delivery,<br>
once drug molecules cross the stratum corneum, their entry in to the lower layers of<br>
the skin and subsequent uptake into the systemic circulation is relatively rapid and<br>
unhindered.<br>
Drugs can penetrate the skin either across the stratum corneum 2, through sweat<br>
glands 1, or through hair follicles 3, as indicated in Figure 1.<br>
Active Drug Delivery Mechanisms<br>
Beside the passive methods described above, numerous active methods for delivering<br>
drugs through the skin have been investigated. These systems can generally be<br>
classified into two categories: by-passing or removal of the stratum corneum, and<br>
electrically assisted delivery of drugs. Electrically assisted methods are iontophoresis,<br><br>
phonophoresis, electroportation, use of stress waves, and photomechanical delivery.<br>
Follicular delivery allows one to by-pass the stratum corneum, and microscission and<br>
microneedle technologies can be used to remove or penetrate the barrier layer. These<br>
are further detailed below.<br>
Electrically Assisted Drug Delivery<br>
Iontophoresis<br>
Iontophoresis is a non-invasive method of delivering drugs and uses low-level<br>
electrical energy in a safe and effective manner. It utilises bipolar electric fields to<br>
transport drug molecules across the skin into underlying tissue. The mechanism by<br>
which penetration is enhanced has been determined to be due to pore enlargement<br>
and/or new pore formation in addition to increased electrochemical potential<br>
difference across the skin. There is potential for tissue damage resulting in pain<br>
depending on the morphology of the area of application.<br>
Phonophoresis<br>
The use of ultrasound (also termed sonophoresis or phonophoresis) in drug delivery<br>
was first reported in the 1950's, and currently there are numerous examples of its use<br>
to enhance transdermal drug delivery including the delivery of large molecules such<br>
as proteins. Ultrasound has been used in the frequency range of 20kHz to 19MHz to<br>
increase the permeability of the skin, though it has been demonstrated that frequencies<br>
in the lower range of below 100kHz exhibit a higher ability to improve skin<br>
permeability.<br>
The general mechanism of action includes ultrasound-mediated thermal effects,<br>
transient cavitation, and acoustic streaming. The thermal effects involve the elevation<br>
of skin temperature which can enhance the diffusion of molecules through the skin.<br>
Efficiency of ultrasound transmission through skin is reduced by attenuation through<br>
scatter and absorption, though a few degrees centigrade increase in tissue temperature<br>
is achieved, depending on duration of application of the ultrasound. It is thought that<br>
the thermal effect is further enhanced by radiation pressure force on the molecules,<br>
resulting from the tissue absorbing wave energy, which pushes the molecules in the<br><br>
direction of propagation of the waves. Exposure of the skin to ultrasonics leads to<br>
bubble formation which can be mild gas filled bubbles or vapour filled bubbles which<br>
violently collapse leading to cavity formation. This can lead to alterations in the skin's<br>
structure due to Shockwaves created as a result of the collapse. The oscillation of<br>
cavitation bubbles leads to liquid streaming, and this is termed acoustic streaming<br>
which can also facilitate drug diffusion through the skin.<br>
The main disadvantages are the potential consequences of permanent changes to the<br>
skin's structure created by cavitation bubbles.<br>
Electroportation<br>
In electroportation a small electric pulse is applied to the skin surface which results in<br>
the creation of a transient aqueous pathway through the upper layer of the skin and its<br>
protein and lipid membrane. For electroportation to occur the voltage across the skin<br>
must reach a few hundred millivolts with an electric field pulse of between 10µs and<br>
100 ms. Initially upon applying the pulse the membrane becomes charged and after a<br>
short period of stability it becomes unstable at which point electroportation occurs.<br>
Stress waves<br>
The application of stress waves to the skin using laser has been used to enhance the<br>
permeability of the skin to drug molecules. However, it has also been shown that mild<br>
heating of the skin prior to using laser induced stress waves (LISW) further<br>
significantly enhances the permeability of the skin (2). The mechanism is thought to<br>
be an increase in the fluidity of the intercellular lipids resulting in swelling of the<br>
corneocytes which allow the laser to form channels for the passage of drug through<br>
the skin. The primary complications of this method are the complexity of the<br>
procedure and prohibitive equipment costs.<br>
Photomechanical delivery<br>
Photomechanical drug delivery involves the use of high pressure gradients to increase<br>
skin permeability. The pressure is created by a mechanical stress pulse, generated by a<br>
laser. This causes a transient increase in the skin's permeability to drug molecules.<br><br>
The barrier property of the skin recovers within minutes. It has been demonstrated<br>
that macromolecules of up to 40kDa can cross the skin's barrier layer during the<br>
transient lapse in its barrier function.<br>
Removing or By-Passing the Skin Surface<br>
Follicular drug delivery<br>
Follicular drug delivery utilizes pores associated with skin appendages, such as hair<br>
follicle and shaft, and sebaceous glands, to bypass the stratum corneum and allow<br>
drugs to penetrate deeper layers of the skin. The cross-sectional area of the follicular<br>
route is relatively small, however the rich blood supply associated with skin<br>
appendages associated with follicular delivery enhances absorption of the drugs thus<br>
enhancing the passage of drugs through the skin.<br>
Microscission<br>
This is a technique that creates microconduits through the stratum corneum and<br>
underlying tissues, using a combination of momentum transfer and seizing.<br>
Momentum is imparted through an ablatory mechanism that utilizes a stream of gas-<br>
entrained inert sharp particles that are accelerated towards the skin at an oblique<br>
angle. This results in the painless production of micro-holes or conduits on the skin<br>
surface. The difference between this and for example use of microneedles is that upon<br>
withdrawal of the microneedle the opening that was created closes in on itself. Holes<br>
have been created that are in the order of 100-250um in diameter and 200µm deep,<br>
and can be produced repeatedly, rapidly, accurately and painlessly. The accurate<br>
control of particle size, flux, carrier gas pressure, area and time of exposure are<br>
critical, thus limiting its practical applications. The skin is shown to heal rapidly and<br>
does not suffer from adverse events as a result of the ablation.<br>
Microfabrication Technologies<br>
Microneedle arrays<br>
The microneedle concept was first conceived in the 1970's, but the first microneedle<br>
arrays for increasing skin permeability were developed by Hashmi et al. in the late<br>
1990's with the more widespread availability of fabrication technologies. It has been<br><br>
possible to produce arrays of needles of controlled length, to avoid penetration of the<br>
nerves, and sufficiently high strength to penetrate the stratum corneum, thus providing<br>
a vehicle for overcoming the skin's protective barrier to enhance drug delivery in a<br>
painless manner. They may be used to 'prepare' the skin surface prior to drug delivery<br>
via a patch for example. The microneedles may also be used to deliver drugs directly<br>
into the skin by interfacing to a drug reservoir, with subsequent control through<br>
integrated electronic circuitry and actuation mechanisms.<br>
MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) syringe<br>
The MEMS syringe is based on silicon, and soft lithographic techniques. It consists of<br>
an array of hollow pointed silicon microneedles and a deformable PDMS<br>
(polydimethylsiloxane) reservoir for holding the drug. The design of the system<br>
addressed the issue of clog formation caused by shear induced particle sedimentation<br>
upon delivery of the drug and has been successfully tested on model skin tissue. The<br>
needles are designed to penetrate the skin at depths of up to 200µm, painlessly as<br>
there are no nerve endings at these depths, from which they can diffuse into deeper<br>
layers of the skin and be absorbed into the blood.<br>
The advantage of this system is that is provides a means of delivering drugs in a dry<br>
lyophilised form, which means that storage temperatures do not need to be controlled,<br>
hence drugs and vaccines can be widely distributed especially to remote and third<br>
world locations.<br>
The Invention<br>
The invention provides a transdermal drug delivery device as defined in claim 1.<br>
Further, preferred features of the invention are defined in the subclaims.<br>
In this specification, the term "lower" and related terms are used to indicate the side<br>
of the transdermal drug delivery device that is intended to be placed in contact with<br>
the patient's skin during use. The term "upper" and related terms are used to indicate<br>
the opposite side of the device. Such terms are not intended to define the absolute<br>
orientation of the device.<br><br>
When placed in contact with the patient's skin, the device provides active delivery of<br>
drugs into the body. The device causes disruption of the skin's biggest barrier to the<br>
entry of foreign materials, i.e. the stratum corneum. Moreover, the system causes an<br>
expansion of the pores of the skin's follicular route, further enhancing the routes of<br>
entry for the said agents. Disruption may also occur to underlying lipid layers causing<br>
further enhancement in diffusion of these agents via the skin.<br>
The device has the potential to deliver the following types of drugs and therapeutic<br>
agents and molecules:<br>
•	Proteins and macromolecules<br>
•	Ionic drugs<br>
•	Non ionic drugs<br>
•	Lipophilic drugs<br>
•	Hydrophilic drugs<br>
•	Vaccines<br>
The device has the potential to deliver the following formulations:<br>
•	Solids - e.g., particles and lyophilised material<br>
•	Liquids<br>
•	Semi-solids<br>
•	Emulsions<br>
•	Gels<br>
The device has potential uses in the following therapeutic categories, among others:<br>
•	Contraception - e.g., ethinyl estradiol and a novel progesterone,<br>
norelgestromin.<br>
•	Cancer pain - e.g., Duragesic, a formulation of fentanyl citrate, a potent opioid<br>
analgesic, commonly used for chronic cancer pain management.<br>
•	CNS - e.g., rotigotine patch for dopamine stimulation required to reduce<br>
fluctuating Parkinson's symptoms and selegiline for depression.<br><br>
•	Diabetes - e.g., Insulin<br>
•	Hormone replacement and pain related - e.g., Estraderm (estradiol), indicated<br>
for the relief of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and for the treatment<br>
of osteoporosis.<br>
•	Cardiovascular - e.g., Nitroderm TTS (nitroglycerin)<br>
•	Vaccines - e.g., to elicit an immune response<br>
The device may enhance penetration of the skin through one or more routes including<br>
but not restricted to those listed below:<br>
•	Transappendageal - the penetrant transverses the stratum corneum via a<br>
'shunt' pathway (e.g. a hair follicle or sweat gland). Given the relative density<br>
of hair follicles and sweat glands on the human body, hair follicles are by far<br>
the most common route for drug delivery. The mechanical action on the<br>
reservoir will create pressure on its contents thus forcing it through the<br>
available exits. In this case it will be forced towards the pores and follicles.<br>
These pores and follicles will expand in diameter due to the forces exerted on<br>
them through extension of the reservoir and its underlying adhesive layer that<br>
is in contact with the skin. This may be further enhanced by use of 'vacuum'<br>
as described below.<br>
•	Transcellular - the permeant crosses the stratum corneum by the most direct<br>
route and repeatedly partitions between, and diffuses through, the cornified<br>
cells and the extracellular lipid bi-layers. The rate of permeation will be<br>
dramatically enhanced as the layer of dead protein/skin cells are disrupted by<br>
the physical force exerted on them through extension of the reservoir and its<br>
underlying adhesive layer that is in contact with the skin, thus breaking down<br>
the biggest barrier to drug entry. This disruption to the stratum corneum may<br>
be microscopic or macroscopic or both.<br>
•	Lipid bi-layers - Disruption to the underlying lipid bi-layers may cause further<br>
enhancement of diffusion of agents through the skin, and stimulation of<br>
localised immune type reactions.<br><br>

Detailed description of the Accompanying drawings<br>
The transdermal drug delivery device illustrated in Figure 2 comprises a reservoir<br>
layer 10 that consists of a series of chambers containing one or more drugs or other<br>
therapeutic molecules in one or more type of formulation. The reservoir layer 10 is<br>
flexible and its lower surface is bounded by a resilient membrane 12, which is<br>
perforated by pores through which the drug formulation can pass. An adhesive<br>
layer 14 is applied to the membrane 12, which is intended to attach the device to the<br>
skin of a patient. The adhesive layer 14 must be suitable for removably bonding the<br>
membrane 12 to human or animal skin.<br>
A second adhesive layer 16, which may comprise a different adhesive from the<br>
layer 14, bonds an upper surface of the reservoir layer 10 to an extensor layer 18. In<br>
this embodiment of the invention, the extensor layer 18 is formed as a<br>
microelectromechanical (MEMS) device. A third layer of adhesive 20, which may be<br>
similar to the second layer 16, bonds the extensor layer to a control layer 22<br>
comprising microelectronic control circuitry for the extensor layer 18. Electrical<br>
contacts between the extensor layer 18 and the control layer 22 are indicated<br>
schematically by dotted lines 23.<br><br>
The device operates by the extensor layer 18 alternately extending and relaxing the<br>
reservoir layer 10, so that the drug is squeezed out of the chambers in the reservoir<br>
layer 10 and through the pores in the resilient membrane 12.<br>
The stretching and relaxation of the reservoir layer 10 leads to stretching and<br>
elongation and relaxation of the pores 26 in the base of the reservoir layer 10. The<br>
force on the contents of the reservoir leads to the contents being physically forced in<br>
the direction of the skin surface and its appendages.<br>
The stretching and relaxation of the reservoir layer 10 leads in turn to stretching and<br>
relaxation of the adhesive layer 14 at the base of the reservoir layer 10 that is attached<br>
to the skin. This subsequently leads to stretching and relaxation of the skin and its<br>
surface layer, the stratum corneum, and pores such as sweat pores and hair follicles.<br>
Extension and relaxation of the skin surface results in disruption of the skin surface<br>
cells/barrier and enhancement of pore diameters of the appendages, thus enhancing<br>
the delivery of the drug or therapeutic agent through the skin into the body.<br>
A first example of the reservoir layer 10 is shown schematically in Figure 3. The<br>
layer 10 is divided into a number of cuboidal chambers 24, each of which is provided<br>
with pores 26 through the portion of the resilient membrane 12 that forms the lower<br>
surface of the chamber.<br>
A second example of the reservoir layer 10 is shown schematically in Figure 4. The<br>
layer 10 contains a number of domed chambers 24, each of which is provided with<br>
pores 26 through the portion of the resilient membrane 12 that forms the lower surface<br>
of the chamber.<br>
Each chamber 24 is sufficiently flexible to extend in response to the extensor/relaxor<br>
forces placed upon it by the extensor layer 18 of the system. It is also sufficiently<br>
rigid and/or externally constrained to allow extension without any significant increase<br>
in volume. Preferably, there is a decrease in volume, resulting in pressurised<br>
chambers when the device is actuated. The reservoir layer 10 may be composed of<br><br>
numerous large chambers 24 each measuring up to 10mm in diameter, or several<br>
hundred smaller chambers 24 each measuring a few micrometers in diameter.<br>
The material of composition of the reservoir chambers 24 may be polymeric, e.g. the<br>
Eudragit (Registered Trade Mark) range of pharmaceutical polymers sold by<br>
Rohm GmbH, acrylic acid cross-linked polymers, or PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane).<br>
The pores 26 may be formed to be open in the relaxed state of the membrane 12 and<br>
will expand and relax upon application of the extensor/relaxor stimulus. The diameter<br>
of the pores may be between a few micrometers and 1000 micrometers (1 mm).<br>
Alternatively, the pores may be formed to be constricted, whereby material is not<br>
removed during pore creation, thus leading to pores being closed during the relaxed<br>
state and open or extended during the extension phase.<br>
The extensor layer 18 may be square, round, or any other shape, which may or may<br>
not be the shape and size of the final transdermal patch. It may be located above,<br>
below or to one or more edges of the reservoir layer 10.<br>
The degree of extension and relaxation may be 
of the system, or up to about 200% of the total nominal dimensions of the system, the<br>
upper limit being determined by the extensibility of the human or animal skin to<br>
which the device is to be attached. The frequency of extension and relaxation may be<br>
between one cycle per 300 seconds and 1000 cycles per second.<br>
Several factors are inter-related in terms of effect on drug delivery, e.g., degree of<br>
pore extension per extensor cycle, and frequency of extensor actuation, and the<br>
physical and chemical properties of the formulation in which the drug is contained.<br>
Prolonged extension, i.e., prolonged obstruction free pathway between reservoir and<br>
skin pore, may be beneficial e.g., where a low viscosity, solution of low interfacial<br><br>
tension is used to formulate the drug, which is deposited in the reservoir of the device,<br>
from which it readily exits upon extensor actuation.<br>
Rapid extension and relaxation may be beneficial for example where a high viscosity<br>
formulation is used to incorporate the drug prior to depositing in the reservoir of the<br>
delivery device. In this instance the mechanical pressure may be more important in<br>
facilitating delivery into the pores of the skin from where the drug may gradually<br>
diffuse into the blood circulation.<br>
As previously described, the device according to the invention provides three possible<br>
modes of drug delivery, namely via pores, through disruption of the dead protein cells<br>
of the stratum corneum, and through disruption of the lipid bi-layers. It follows that<br>
where there is diffusion of drug through the enlarged pores, where the extensor<br>
actuation frequency may be as low as once per 300 seconds, this leaves little scope for<br>
delivery through the second and third routes mentioned above, since the actuation of<br>
the extensor layer may not have been vigorous enough to cause disruption of either<br>
the stratum corneum or the underlying lipid bi-layers at such low frequency.<br>
There may be circumstances where the various modes of delivery may be required to<br>
complement each other in order to achieve therapeutic efficacy. This may thus for<br>
example, require initial high frequency for a short duration, resulting in the disruption<br>
of the stratum corneum and underlying lipid bi-layers, followed by a lower frequency<br>
to allow time for enhanced diffusion to then take place through all three routes. The<br>
extensor layer may be controlled to operate with any desired pattern of frequency over<br>
time.<br>
The extensor layer 18 may be composed of a number of materials including but not<br>
limited to polymeric, gelatinous, metallic, synthetic fibre derived and piezoelectric<br>
which, when suitably constructed and interfaced to the control layer 22, will respond<br>
to a control stimulus to cause extension and relaxation. Preferably, however, tThe<br>
extensor layer 18 is preferably fabricated as a microelectromechanical (MEMS)<br>
device consisting of a micrometer sized motor or some other mechanical system that<br><br>
will cause xtension and relaxation of a layer of material that is interfaced to the<br>
reservoir la er 10. One example of a MEMS system that has been found to be<br>
particularly suitable uses an electropolymeric material, a thin film of which can be<br>
attached to the reservoir layer 14 to act as the extensor layer 18.<br>
The extensi n and relaxation caused by the extensor layer may result in elongation<br>
along a simple axis, as shown in Figure 5. In this example, elements 28 of a<br>
microelectro mechanical motor slide past one another to extend the rectangular<br>
extensor layer 18 in the direction shown by the open arrows. However, other<br>
arrangemen of motor elements could be used to achieve the same result.<br>
Alternatively extension and relaxation caused by the extensor layer 18 may be equal<br>
in all directions to give equal extension and relaxation of the reservoir layer 10 in all<br>
directions, may be uneven in various directions to give uneven extension and<br>
relaxation in various directions. Figure 6 illustrates an example of a circular extensor<br>
layer 18 that is extended by a microelectromechanical motor (not shown) equally in<br>
all directions as shown by the open arrows, or comprises a film of electropolymeric<br>
material that expands equally in all directions on connection to a power supply.<br>
The control layer 22 will contain appropriate microelectronic circuitry, designed to<br>
control the extension and relaxation of the extensor layer 18, in terms of degree and<br>
frequency of extension and relaxation. The fabrication of the control layer 22 shall be<br>
using standard integrated circuit fabrication technology, and appropriate materials,<br>
layout and interface to the extensor layer 18, as will be evident to a skilled person in<br>
the field.<br>
The relaxation of the reservoir layer 14 may be passive, i.e. effected by the resilient<br>
reservoir layer 14 returning naturally to its relaxed state. Preferably, and especially<br>
when the device is to be operated at high frequencies, the extensor layer 18 may be<br>
actively controlled to drive the reservoir layer 14 to its relaxed state.<br><br>
The control ayer 22 may also contain a power supply, which may be a standard thin<br>
film power supply or may utilise polymer film cell technology, providing power from<br>
a thin film of polymer or other thin film material.<br>
The extenson layer 18 may be configured so as to actuate the chambers 24 of the<br>
reservoir layer 10 either collectively, or in groups, or individually through control<br>
over the actuation of the extensor layer motions by the control layer 22, and<br>
appropriate inerfacing of the extensor layer 18 to the reservoir layer 10 and its<br>
chambers 2.<br>
Actuation of the device may be instantaneous, delayed, or intermittent over a period<br>
of hours or days.<br>
Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible adhesives shall be used in<br>
the adhesive layers 16,20 to interface the various layers and components and in the<br>
adhesive layer 14 that is to be in contact with the skin. The adhesive layers 14,16,20,<br>
in particular the layer 14 in contact with the skin, shall be sufficiently strong to<br>
withstand lateral extension forces, and be flexible enough to be able to relax back to<br>
their original state.<br>
Passage of drugs and other therapeutic molecules through the adhesive layer 14 must<br>
not be of are significant impact on the overall functioning of the system. Extension<br>
of the reser ir layer 10 will result in the extension of the adhesive layer 14 too, thus<br>
resulting in tinning of the adhesive layer 14 and further minimizing any effect on the<br>
passage of drugs through the adhesive layer. Pores may be created in the adhesive<br>
layer 14. If they are directly opposite the pores 26 in the reservoir layer 10, they will<br>
provide an obstruction free path for the flow of materials.<br>
Given that the uppermost layer of the skin, the stratum corneum, consists of dead<br>
cells, it is conceivable that upon repeated cycles of extension and relaxation, the<br>
adhesion to the skin may be lost in certain areas due to the complete removal of dead<br><br>
skin cells from the stratum corneum, in particular where the degree of extension is<br>
large.<br>
In such circumstances a beneficial feature would be an increase in the surface<br>
roughness of the porous resilient membrane 12, such that the area of contact with the<br>
surface of the skin is increased. This rough surface could be uniform or non-uniform<br>
and may even provide anchorage points on the skin surface, thus making localised<br>
loss of adhesion less likely or absent altogether.<br>
A further enhancement of the device is illustrated in Figure 7, in contact with a<br>
patient's skin 30. The enhanced device includes additional features in the reservoir<br>
layer 10 that may further increase drug uptake through the appendages of the skin and<br>
also enhance diffusion.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the resilient membrane 12 includes large<br>
pores 26 with slightly rigid walls. A thinner, collapsible membrane 36 seals the<br>
pores 26 from the chamber 24 containing the drug. The collapsible membrane 36 is<br>
strong enough not to be breached upon application of the extensor and relaxor<br>
stimulus to the reservoir layer 10. Pores 32 in the adhesive layer 14 are aligned with<br>
the pores 26 in the resilient membrane 12.<br>
Micro-channels 34 lead from the pores 26,32 to a pump or some other vacuum<br>
creating device (not shown), which may be micro-fabricated. Activation of the pump<br>
will cause the evacuation of the pores 26,32 and thus a reduction in pressure in the<br>
pores. The results will be collapse of these pores 26,32 and to an extent, collapse of<br>
the pores in the skin itself that have been widened by the flexor/relaxor motion of the<br>
device.<br>
Once a threshold level of vacuum is reached, the collapsible membrane 36 will<br>
collapse, resulting in the drug filling both the pore cavities 26,32 in the device leading<br>
out of the reservoir layer 10, and the pores in the skin 30 that have partially collapsed<br><br>
towards the upper surface. The speed of uptake of the drug or therapeutic agent will<br>
be dramatically enhanced as a result.<br>
In the enhanced device as described and illustrated, the collapsible membrane 36 can<br>
only be ruptured once, therefore this device is most suitable for administering a single<br>
dose of the drug. Alternative means of providing a temporary seal between the<br>
chambers 2 and the pores 26 may be provided. One such alternative would be a<br>
micro-valve which remains closed until the pressure difference across it exceeds a<br>
threshold and then opens to release the drug from the chamber 24. When the pump is<br>
switched of and the pressure difference falls again, such a valve may close again,<br>
allowing the device to be re-used. Thereby the enhanced device can be used to<br>
deliver the drug to the patient intermittently over an extended period.<br><br>
