				<td>SECONDARY AMINO ANILINIC PIPERIDINES AS MCH1 ANTAGONISTS<br>
AND USES THEREOF<br>
This application claims priority of U.S. Serial No. 10/189,145, filed July 3, 2002, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced in parentheses by author and year. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims.<br>
The disclosure of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide originally isolated from salmonid (teleost fish) pituitaries (Kawauchi et al., 1983). In fish the 17 amino acid peptide causes aggregation of melanin within the melanophores and inhibits the release of ACTH, acting as a functional antagonist of cx-MSH. Mammalian MCH (19 amino acids) is highly conserved between rat, mouse, and human, exhibiting 100% amino acid identity, but its physiological roles are .less clear. MCH has been reported to participate in a variety of processes including feeding, water balance, energy metabolism, general arousal/attention state, memory and cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders (for reviews, see Baker, 1991;<br><br>
Baker, 1994; Nahon, 1994; Knigge et al., 1996). Its role in feeding or body weight regulation is supported by a recent Nature publication (Qu et al., 1996) demonstrating that MCH is over expressed in the hypothalamus of ob/ob mice compared with ob/+ mice, and that fasting further increased MCH mRNA in both obese and normal mice during fasting. MCH also stimulated feeding in normal rats when injected into the lateral ventricles (Rossi et al., 1997).<br>
MCH also has been reported to functionally antagonize the behavioral effects of a-MSH (Miller et al., 1993; Gonzalez et al, 1996; Sanchez et al., 1997); in addition, stress has been shown to increase POMC mRNA levels while decreasing the MCH precursor preproMCH (ppMCH) mRNA levels (Presse et al., 1.992). Thus MCH may serve as an integrative neuropeptide involved in the reaction to stress, as well as in the regulation of feeding and sexual activity (Baker, 1991; Knigge et al., 1996).<br>
The biological effects of MCH are believed to be mediated by specific receptors. A tritiated ligand ( [3H]-MCH) was reported to exhibit specific binding to brain membranes but was unusable for saturation analyses, so neither affinity nor Bmax were determined (Drozdz and Eberle, 1995) . Radioiodination of the tyrosine at position thirteen resulted in a ligand with dramatically reduced biological activity (see Drozdz and Eberle, 1995). In contrast, the radioiodination of the MCH analogue [Phe23,Tyr19] -MCH was successful (Drozdz et al., 1995); the ligand retained biological activity and exhibited specific binding to a variety of cell lines including mouse melanoma  (B16-F1, G4F, and G4F-7),  PC12, and COS cells.<br><br>
In G4F-7 cells, the KD = 0.118nM and the Bmax -1100 sites/cell. Importantly, the binding was not inhibited by a-MSH but was weakly inhibited by rat ANF (Ki = 116 nM vs. 12 nM for native MCH) (Drozdz et al., 1995) . More recently specific MCH binding was reported in transformed keratinocytes (Burgaud et al., 1997) and melanoma cells (Drozdz et al., 1998), where photo-crosslinking studies suggest that the receptor is a membrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of 45-50 kDaltons, compatible with the molecular weight range of the GPCR super family of receptors. No radio auto radiographic studies of MCH receptor localization using this ligand have been reported as yet.<br>
The localization and biological activities of MCH peptide suggest that the modulation of MCH receptor activity may be useful in a number of therapeutic applications. The role of MCH in feeding is the best characterized of its potential clinical uses. MCH is expressed in the lateral hypothalamus, a brain area implicated in the regulation of thirst and hunger (Grillon et al., 1997); recently orexins A and 3, which are potent orexigenic agents, have been shown :o have very similar localization to MCH in the lateral hypothalamus (Sakurai et al., 1998) . MCH mRNA levels in this brain region are increased in rats after 24 hours of food-deprivation (Herve and Fellman, 1997) ; after insulin injection, a significant increase in the abundance and staining intensity of MCH immunoreactive perikarya and fibres was observed concurrent with a significant increase in the level of MCH mRNA (Bahjaoui-Bouhaddi et al., 1994).<br><br>
Consistent with the ability of MCH to stimulate feeding in rats (Rossi et al., 1997) is the observation that MCH mRNA levels are upregulated in the hypothalami of obese ob/ob mice (Qu et al., 1996), and decreased in the hypothalami of rats treated with leptin, whose food intake and body weight gains are also decreased (Sahu, 1998) . MCH appears to act as a functional antagonist of the melanocortin system in its effects on food intake and on hormone secretion within the HPA (hypothalamopituitary/adrenal axis) (Ludwig et al., 1998) . Together these data suggest a role for endogenous MCH in the regulation of energy balance and response to stress, and provide a rationale for the development of specific compounds acting at MCH receptors for use in the treatment of obesity and stress-related disorders.<br>
In all species studied to date, a major portion of the neurons of the MCH cell group occupies a rather constant location in. those areas of the lateral hypothalamus and subthalamus where they lie and may be a part of some of the so-called "extrapyramidal" motor circuits. These involve substantial striato and pallidofugal pathways involving the thalamus and cerebral cortex, hypothalamic areas, and reciprocal connections to subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and mid-brain centers (Bittencourt et al., 1992). In their location, the MCH cell group may offer a bridge or mechanism for expressing hypothalamic visceral activity with appropriate and coordinated motor activity. Clinically it may be of some value to consider the involvement of this MCH system in movement disorders, such as Parkinson=s disease and Huntingdon's Chorea in which extrapyramidal circuits are known to be involved.<br><br>
Human genetic linkage studies have located authentic. hMCH loci on chromosome 12 (12q23-24) and the variant hMCH loci on chromosome 5 (5ql2-13) (Pedeutour et al., 1994). Locus 12q23-24 coincides with a locus to which autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2) has been mapped (Auburger et al., 1992; Twells et al., 1992) . This disease comprises neurodegenerative disorders, including an olivopontocerebellar atrophy.<br>
Furthermore, the gene for Darier's disease, has been mapped to locus 12q23-24 (Craddock et al., 1993). Darier's disease is characterized by abnormalities I keratinocyte adhesion and mental illnesses in some families. In view of the functional and neuroanatomical patterns of the MCH neural system in the rat and human brains, the MCH gene may represent a good candidate for SCA2 or Darier's disease.. Interestingly, diseases with high social impact have been mapped to this locus. Indeed, the gene responsible for chronic or acute forms of spinal muscular atrophies has been assigned to chromosome 5ql2-13 using genetic linkage analysis (Melki et al. , 1990; Westbrook et al., 1992) . Furthermore, independent lines of evidence support the assignment of a major schizophrenia locus to chromosome 5qll.2-13.3 (Sherrington et al., 1988; Bassett et al., 1988; Gilliam et al., 1989). The above studies suggest that MCH may play a role in neuro degenerative diseases and disorders of emotion.<br>
Additional therapeutic applications for MCH-related compounds are suggested by the observed effects of MCH in other biological systems.  For example, MCH may regulate<br><br>
reproductive functions in male and female rats. MCH transcripts and MCH peptide were found within germ cells in testes of adult rats, suggesting that MCH may participate in stem cell renewal and/or differentiation of early spermatocytes (Hervieu et al., 1996) . MCH injected directly into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or ventromedial nucleus (VMM) stimulated sexual activity in female rats (Gonzalez et al., 1996). In ovariectomized rats primed with estradiol, MCH stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) release while anti-MCH antiserum inhibited LH release (Gonzalez et al., 1997). The zona incerta, which contains a large population of MCH cell bodies, has previously been identified as a regulatory site for the pre-ovulatory LH surge (MacKenzie et al., 1984).<br>
MCH has been reported to influence release of pituitary hormones including ACTH and oxytocin. MCH analogues may also be useful in treating epilepsy. In the PTZ seizure model, injection of MCH prior to seizure induction prevented seizure activity in both rats and guinea pigs, suggesting that MCH-containing neurons may participate in the neural circuitry underlying PTZ-induced seizure (Knigge and Wagner, 1997) , MCH has also been observed to affect behavioral correlates of cognitive functions. MCH treatment hastened extinction of the passive avoidance response in rats (McBride et al. , 1994), raising the possibility • that MCH receptor antagonists may be beneficial for memory storage and/or retention. A possible role for MCH in the modulation or perception of pain is supported by the dense innervation of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) by MCH-positive fibers. Finally, MCH may participate in the regulation of fluid<br><br>
intake. ICV infusion of MCH in conscious sheep produced diuretic, natriuretic, and kaliuretic changes in response to increased plasma volume (Parkes, 1996). Together with anatomical data reporting the presence of MCH in fluid regulatory areas of the brain, the results indicate that MCH may be an important peptide involved in the central control of fluid homeostasis in mammals.<br>
The identification of a G-protein coupled receptor for MCH has recently been published (Chambers et al., 1999; "Saito et al., 1999). These groups identified MCH as the endogenous ligand for the human orphan G-protein coupled receptor SLC-1 (Lakaye et al., 1998) . The rat homologue of this receptor (now called MCH-1) was reported to be localized in regions of the rat brain associated with feeding behavior (e.g. dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus). The link between MCH-1 and the effects of MCH on feeding has been strengthened by recent reports on the phenotype of MCH-1 knockout mice. Two groups have shown independently (Marsh et al, 2002; Chen et al, 2002) that the targeted disruption of the MCH-1 receptor gene (MCH-1 knockout) in mice results in animals that are hyperphagic but are lean and have decreased body mass relative to wild-type littermates. The decrease in body mass is attributed to an increase in metabolism. Each group demonstrated that the MCH-1 knockout mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, and generally exhibit weights similar to littermates maintained on regular chow.<br>
Finally, synthetic antagonist molecules for the MCH-1 receptor have now been described in the literature. Bednarek et al.  (2002) have reported on the synthesis of<br><br>
high affinity peptide antagonists of MCH-1. In addition, a small molecule antagonist of MCH-1 has been described by Takekawa et al. (Takekawa et al. , 2002) . This compound, 7-226296, exhibits high affinity for the MCH-1 receptor (-5-9 nM for rat and human MCH-1) , and was shown to inhibit food intake induced by the intracerebroventricular application of MCH. These data validate the strategy of using an MCH-1 receptor antagonist to treat obesity.<br>
Furthermore, in our own studies, we have tested MCH1 antagonists in several animal models that are well known as predictive for the efficacy of compounds in humans (Borowsky, et al. , Nature Medicine 2003). These experiments indicate that MCH1 antagonists are useful to treat obesity, depression, anxiety, as well as urinary disorders.<br>
Herein, we report the synthesis of secondary amino anilinic piperidines that bind to the cloned human melanin-concentrating hormone-1 (MCH1) receptor. Additionally, these compounds selectively bind to the MCH1-receptor against other cloned G-protein coupled recepior. The ability to inhibit the activation of the cloned receptor as measured in in vitro assays is disclosed.<br>
Furthermore,  the compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat abnormal conditions mediated by inactivation  of  the  MCH-1  receptor  such  as  feeding disorders   (obesity,   bulimia  and  bulimia   nervosa), sexual/reproductive   disorders,   depression,   anxiety, depression and anxiety,  epileptic seizure, hypertension,<br><br>
cerebral hemorrhage, congestive heart failure, sleep disturbances, or any condition in which antagonism of an MCH1 receptor may be beneficial.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the present invention may be used to reduce the body mass of a subject. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be used to treat urinary disorders.<br><br>

An illustration of the invention is a pharmaceutical composition made by admixing any one of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
Illustrative of the invention is a process for making a pharmaceutical , composition comprising admixing any of the compounds of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
A solid carrier can include one or more substances which may also act as endogenous carriers (e.g. nutrient or micronutrient carriers), flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents; it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example,<br><br>
calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.<br>
Liquid carriers are used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs and pressurized compositions. The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fats. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmoregulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (partially containing additives as above, e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration, the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate or isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are useful in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. The liquid carrier for pressurized compositions can be a halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellent.<br>
Liquid  pharmaceutical  compositions  which  are  sterile solutions or suspensions can be utilized by for example,<br><br>
intramuscular, intrathecal, epidural, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. The compounds may be pre'pared as a sterile solid composition which may be dissolved .or suspended at the time of administration using sterile water, saline, or other appropriate sterile injectable medium. Carriers are intended to include necessary and inert binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. The compound can be administered orally in the form of a sterile solution or suspension containing other solutes or suspending agents (for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic), bile salts, acacia, gelatin, sorbitan monoleate, polysorbate 80 (oleate esters of sorbitol and its anhydrides copolymerized with ethylene oxide) and the like.<br>
The compound can also be administered orally either in liquid or solid composition form. Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, capsules, granules, tablets, and powders, and liquid forms, such, as solutions, syrups, elixirs,, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions, and suspenions.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound in use, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of the disease condition. Additional factors depending on the particular subject being treated will<br><br>
result in a need to adjust dosages, including subject age, weight, gender, diet, and time of administration.<br>

In some cases, cell lines that grow as adherent monolayers can be converted to suspension culture to increase cell<br><br>
yield and provide large batches of uniform assay material for routine receptor screening projects.<br>
Transient expression<br>
DNA encoding proteins to be studied can be transiently expressed in a variety of mammalian, insect, amphibian and other cell lines by several methods including but not restricted to; calcium phosphate-mediated, DEAE-dextran mediated, Liposomal-mediated, viral-mediated, electroporation-mediated and microinjection delivery. Each of these methods may require optimization of assorted experimental parameters depending on the DNA, cell line, and the type of assay to be subsequently employed.<br>
A typical protocol for the calcium phosphate method as applied to Peak rapid 293 cells is described as follows:<br>
Adherent cells are harvested approximately twenty-four hours before transfection and replated at a density of 3.5<br>
allowed to incubate over night at 37°C at 5% C02. 250 Fl of a mixture of CaCl2 and DNA (15 Fg DNA in 250' mM CaCl2) is added to a 5 ml plastic tube and 500 Fl of 2X HBS (28 0 mM NaCl, 10 mM KC1," 1.5 mM Na2HP04, 12 mM dextrose, 50 mM HEPES) is slowly added with gentle mixing. The mixture is allowed to incubate for 2 0 minutes at room temperature to allow a DNA precipitate to form. The DNA precipitate mixture is then added to the culture medium in each plate and incubated for 5 hours at 37°C, 5% C02. After the incubation, 5ml of culture medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 10% L-glut and 50 μg/ml   gentamycin) is added to each plate. The<br><br>
cells are then incubated for 24 to 48 hours at 37°C, 5% C02<br>
A typical protocol'for the DEAE-dextran method as applied to Cos-7 cells is described as follows; Cells to be used for transfection .are split 24 hours prior to the transfection to provide flasks which are 70-80% confluent at the time of transfection. Briefly, 8 Fg of receptor DNA plus 8 Fg of any additional DNA needed (e.g. G∞ protein expression vector,. reporter construct, antihiotic resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) are-added to 9 ml of complete DMEM plus DEAE-dextran mixture (10 mg/ml in PBS) . Cos-7 cells plated into a T225 flask (sub-confluent) are washed once with PBS and the DNA mixture is added to each flask. The cells are. allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37°C, 5% C02. Following the incubation, 36 ml of complete DMEM with 80 FM chloroquine is added to each flask and allowed to incubate an additional 3 hours. The medium is then aspirated and 24 ml of complete medium containing 10% DMSO tor exactly 2 minutes and then aspirated. the cells are then washed 2 times with PBS and 30 ml of complete DMEM added to each flask. The cells are then allowed to incubate over night. The next day the cells are harvested by trypsinization and reseeded as needed depending, upon the type of assay to be performed.<br>
A typical protocol for liposomal-mediated transfection as applied to CHO cells is described as follows; Cells to be used for transfection are split 24 hours prior to the transfection to provide flasks which are 70-80% confluent at the time of transfection. A total of 10 Fg of DNA which may include varying ratios  of receptor  DNA plus  any<br><br>
additional DNA needed (e.g. G∞ protein expression vector, reporter construct, antibiotic resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) is used to trans feet each 75 cm2 flask of cells. Liposomal mediated transfection is carried out according to the manufacturers recommendations (LipofectAMINE, GibcoBRL, Bethesda, MD). Transfected cells are harvested 24 hours post transfection and used or reseeded according the requirements of the assay to be employed.<br>
A typical protocol for the electroporation method as applied, to Cos-7 cells is described as follows; Cells to be used for transfection are split 24 hours prior to the transfection to provide flasks which are subconfluent at the time of transfection. The cells are harvested by trypsinization resuspended in their growth media and counted. 4 x 106 cells are suspended in 30"0 Fl of DMEM and placed into an electroporation cuvette. 8 Fg of receptor DNA plus 8 Fa of anv additional DNA needed (e.g.,G∞  Protein<br>
expression Vector, reporter construct, antibiotic,<br>
resistance marker, mock vector, etc.) is added to the cell suspension, the cuvette is placed into a BioRad Gene Pulser and subjected to an electrical pulse (Gene Pulser settings: 0.25 kV voltage, 950 FF capacitance) . Following the pulse, 800 Fl of complete DMEM is added to each cuvette and the suspension transferred to a sterile tube. Complete medium is added to each tube to bring the final<br><br>
cell concentration to 1 x 105 cells/100 Fl. The cells are then plated as needed depending upon the type of assay to be performed.<br><br>
A typical protocol for' viral mediated expression of heterologous proteins is described as follows for ba.culovirus infection of insect Sf9 cells. The coding region of DNA encoding the receptor disclosed herein may be subcloned into pBlueBacIII into existing restriction sites or sites engineered into sequences 5* and 3! to the coding region of the polypeptides. To generate baculovirus, 0.5 Fg of viral DNA (BaculoGold) and 3 Fg of DNA construct encoding a polypeptide may be co-transfected into 2 x 106 Spodopt'era frugiperda insect Sf9 cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, as outlined in by Pharmingen (in "Baculovirus Expression Vector System: Procedures and Methods Manual") . The cells then are incubated for 5 days at 27°C. The supernatant of the co-transfection plate may be collected by centrifugation and the recombinant virus plaque purified. The procedure to infect cells with virus, to prepare stocks of virus and to titer the virus stocks are as described in Pharmingen=s manual.  Similar principals would in general  apply to<br>
mammalian—cell expression via—retro-viruses,  Simliki<br>
forest virus and double  stranded DNA viruses  such as adeno-, herpes-, and vacinia-viruses, and the like. <br>
Stable expression<br>
Heterologous DNA can be stably incorporated into host cells, causing the cell to perpetually express a foreign protein. Methods for the delivery of the DNA into the cell are similar to those described above for transient expression but require the co-transfection of an ancillary gene to confer drug resistance on the targeted host cell. The ensuing drug resistance can be exploited to select and maintain cells that have taken up the heterologous DNA. An<br><br>
assortment of resistance genes are available including but not restricted to Neomycin, Kanamycin, and Hygromycin. For the purposes of receptor studies, stable expression of a heterologous receptor protein is carried out in, but not necessarily restricted to, mammalian cells including, CHO, HEK293,- LM(tk-) , etc.<br>
Cell membrane preparation<br>
For binding assays, pellets of transfected cells are suspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris.HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized by sonication for 7 sec. The cell lysates are centrifuged at 200 x g for. 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants are then centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets are washed once in the homogenization buffer and suspended in binding buffer (see methods for radioligand binding). Protein concentrations are determined by the method of Bradford (197 6) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Binding assays are usually performed immediately, however it is possible to prepare—membranes—in—batch—and—s-tore—frozen—in—liquid nitrogen for future use.<br>
Radioligand binding assays<br>
Radioligand binding assays for the rat MCHl receptor were carried out using plasmid pcDNA3.1-rMCHl-f (ATCC Patent Deposit Designation No. PTA-3505) . Plasmid pcDNA3.1-rMCHl-'f comprises the regulatory elements necessary for expression of DNA in a mammalian cell operatively linked to DNA encoding the rat MCHl receptor so as to permit expression thereof. Plasmid pcDNA3.1-rMCHl-f was deposited on July 05, 2001, with the American Type Culture Collection  (ATCC),. 12301  Parklawn  Drive,  Rockville,<br><br>
Maryland 20852, U.S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure and was accorded ATCC Patent Deposit Designation No. PTA-3505.<br>
Binding assays can also be performed as described hereinafter using plasmid pEXJ.HR-TL231 (ATCC Accession No. 203197) Plasmid pEXJ.HR-TL231 encodes the human MCHl receptor and was deposited on September 17, 1998, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, U.S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure and was accorded ATCC Accession No. 203197.<br>
Human embryonic kidney Peak rapid 293 cells (Peakr2 93 cells) were transiently transfected with DNA encoding the MCHl receptor utilizing the calcium phosphate method and: cell membranes were prepared as described above,  Binding experiments with membranes from Peakr293 cells transfected with the rat MCHl receptor were performed with 0.08 nM [3H] Compound A (custom labeled by Amersham) (the synthesis of Compound A is described in detail below) using an incubation buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.16 mM PMSF, 1 mM 1,10 phenantroline and 0.2% BSA. Binding was performed at 25°C for 90 minutes. Incubations were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over GF/C glass fiber filters, presoaked in 5% PEI using 50 nM Tris pH 7.4 as wash buffer. In all experiments, nonspecific binding is defined using 10 FM Compound A.<br><br>
Functional   assays<br>
Cells may be screened for the presence of endogenous mammalian receptor using functional assays. Cells with no or a low level of endogenous receptor present may be transfected with the exogenous receptor for use in functional  assays.<br>
A wide spectrum of assays can be employed to screen for<br>
receptor activation. These  range from traditional<br>
measurements of phosphatidyl inositol, cAMP, Ca++, and K+,<br>
for example; to systems measuring these same second<br>
messengers but which have been modified or adapted to be<br>
higher throughput, more generic, and more sensitive; to<br>
cell based platforms reporting more general cellular<br>
events resulting from receptor activation such as<br>
metabolic	changes,	differentiation,	and	cell<br>
division/proliferation, for example; to high level<br>
organism assays which monitor complex physiological or<br>
Denavioral changes thought to be involved With receptor<br>
activation	including	cardiovascular,	analgesic,<br>
orexigenic,   anxiolytic,   and  sedation  effects,   for example.<br>

VI. . In-Vivo Methods<br>
The following in  vivo  methods are performed to predict the efficacy of MCHl antagonists for the treatment of obesity (3-day  body  weight  and  sweetened  condensed  milk), depression (forced swim test), anxiety (social interaction test), and urinary disorders (DIRC and CSTI).<br>
Effects of MCHl Antagonists on Body Weight (3 Day)<br>
Male Long Evans rats (Charles River) weighing 180-200 grams are housed in groups of four on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Test compounds are administered twice daily via i.p. injection, 1 hour before the dark cycle and 2 hours after lights on, for three days. All rats are weighed daily after each morning injection.  Overall results are expressed as body weight<br>
(grams) gained per day (mean ± SEM) and are analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Data for each time point are analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Newman-Keuxs iest. ine data  are  analyzed  using  the  GraphPad  Prism  (v2.01)<br>
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) . All data are presented as means + S.E.M.<br>
Effects of MCHl Antagonists on Consumption of Sweetened Condensed Milk<br>
Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) weighing 17-19 grams at the start of experiments are housed in groups of four or five on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. For 7 days, mice are weighed, placed in individual cages and allowed to drink sweetened condensed<br><br>
milk (Nestle, diluted 1:3 with water) for 1 hour, 2-4 hours into the light cycle. The amount of milk consumed is determined by weighing the milk bottle before and after each drinking bout. On the test day, mice received i.p. injections of Test Compound (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg in 0.01 % lactic acid), vehicle (0.01 % lactic acid) of d-fenfluramine (10 mg/kg in 0.01 % lactic acid) 30 min. prior to exposure to milk. The amount of milk consumed on the test day (in mls milk/ kg body weight) is compared to the baseline consumption for each mouse determined on the previous 2 days. Data for each time point are analyzed by one-way ANOVA. *<br>
Forced Swim Test (FST) in the Rat<br>
Animals<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, NY) are used in all experiments. Rats are housed 5 per cage and maintained on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle. Rats are handled for 1 minutes each day for 4 days prior to behavioral testing.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single i.p. administration of vehicle (2.5% EtOH / 2.5% Tween-80)', imipramine (positive control; 60 mg/kg) , or Test Compound 60 minutes before the start of the 5 minute teat period. All injections are given using 1 cc tuberculin syringe with 2 6 3/8 gauge needles (Becton-Dickinson, , VWR Scientific, Bridgeport, NJ) . The volume of injection is 1 ml/kg.<br><br>
Experimental Design<br>
The procedure used in this study is. similar to that previously described (Porsolt, et al., 1978}, except the water depth is 31 cm in this procedure. The greater depth in this test prevents the rats from supporting themselves by touching the bottom of the cylinder with their feet. Swim sessions are conducted by placing rats in individual plexiglass cylinders (46 cm tall x 20 cm in diameter) containing 23-25°C water 31 cm deep. Swim tests are conducted always between 900 and 1700 hours and consisted of an initial 15-min conditioning test followed 24h later by a 5-minute test. Drug treatments are administered 60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. Following all swim sessions, rats are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes and returned to their home cages. All test sessions are videotaped using a color video camera and recorded for scoring later.<br>
Behavioral Scoring<br>
The rat's behavior is rated at 5 second intervals during the 5 minute test by a single individual, who is blind to the treatment condition.  Scored behaviors are:<br>
1.	Immobility- rat remains floating in the water without struggling and is only making those movements necessary to keep its head above water;<br>
2.	Climbing - rat is making active movements with its forepaws in and out of the water, usually directed against the walls;<br><br>
3.	Swimming - rat is making active swimming motions, more than necessary to merely maintain its head above water, e.g. moving around in the cylinder; and<br>
4.	Diving' - entire body of the rat is submerged.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The forced swim test data (immobility, swimming, climbing, diving) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GprahPad Prism(v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) . All data are presented as means +_ S. E. M. All data are presented as means +_  S.E.M.<br>
Forced Swim Test (FST) in the Mouse<br>
Animals<br>
DBA/2  mice  (Taconic  Farms,  NY)  are  used  in  all<br>
experiments.    Animals  are  housed  5  per  cage  in  a<br>
controlled  environment  under  a  12:12  hour  light:dark<br>
cycle .Animals—are—handled—1—min—each—day—for—4 days<br>
prior to the experiment. This procedure included a mock gavage with a 1.5 inch feeding tube.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Animals are randomly assigned to receive a single administration of vehicle (5% EtOH/5% Tween-80), Test Compound, or imipramine (60 mg/kg) by oral gavage 1 hour before the swim test.<br>
Experimental Design<br>
The procedure for the forced swim test in the mouse is<br>
similar to that described above for the rat, with some<br><br>
modifications. The cylinder used for the test is a 1 liter beaker (10.5cm diameter X 15 cm height) fill to '800ml (10cm depth) of 23-25°C water.  Only one 5-minute swim test is conducted for each mouse, between 1300 and 17 00 hours. Drug treatments are administered 30-60 minutes before the 5-minute test period. Following all swim sessions, mice are removed from the cylinders, dried with paper towels and placed in a heated cage for 15 minutes. All test sessions are videotaped using a Sony color video camera and recorder for scoring later.<br>
Behavorial Scoring<br>
The behavior during minutes 2-5 of the test is played back<br>
on a TV monitor and scored by the investigator.  The total<br>
time spent immobile (animal floating with only minimal<br>
movements  to remain afloat)  and mobile  (swimming" and<br>
movements beyond those required to remain afloat)  are<br>
recorded.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The forced swim test data (time exhibiting immobility, mobility; seconds) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Newman-Keuls test. The data are analyzed using the GraphPad Prism (v2.01) (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). All data are presented as means +_ S.E.M.<br>
Social Interaction Test (SIT)<br>
Rats are allowed to acclimate to the animal care facility for 5 days and are housed singly for 5 days prior to testing. Animals are handled for 5 minutes per day. The design and procedure for the Social Interaction Test is<br><br>
carried out as previously described by Kennett, et al.<br>
(1997) . On the test day, weight matched pairs of rats (± 5%), unfamiliar to each other, are given identical treatments and returned to their home cages. Animals are randomly divided into 5 treatment groups, with 5 pairs per group, and are given one of the following i.p. treatments: Test Compound (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg), vehicle (1 ml/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg). Dosing is 1 hour prior to testing. Rats .are subsequently placed in a white perspex test box or arena (54 x 37 x 26 cm), whose floor is divided up into 24 equal squares, for 15 minutes. An air conditioner is used to generate background noise and to keep the room at approximately 74°F. All sessions are videotaped using a JVC camcorder (model GR-SZl, Elmwood Park, NJ) with either TDK (HG ultimate brand) or' Sony 30 minute videocassettes. All sessions are conducted between 1300 - 1630 hours. Active social interaction, defined as grooming, sniffing, biting, boxing,' wrestling, following and crawling over or under, is scored using a stop'watch<br>
(Sportsline model no. 226, 1/100 sec. discriminabillty) . The number of episodes of rearing (animal completely raises up its body on its hind limbs), grooming (licking, biting, scratching of body), and face wishing (i.e. hands are moved repeatedly over face) , and number of squares crossed are scored. Passive social interaction (animals are lying beside or on top of each other) is not scored. All behaviors are assessed later by an observer who is blind as to the treatment of each pair. At the end of each test, the box is thoroughly wiped with moistened paper towels.<br><br>
Animals<br>
Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, NY) are housed in pairs under a 12 hr light dark cycle (lights on at 0700 hrs.) with free access to food and water.<br>
Drug Administration<br>
Test Compound is dissolved in 100% DMSO or 5% lactic acid, v/v (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) . Chlordiazepoxide (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) is dissolved in double distilled water. The vehicle consists of 50% DMSO (v/v) or 100% dimethylacetamide (DMA) . All drug solutions are made up 10 minutes prior to injection and the solutions are discarded at the end of the test day. The volume of drug solution administered is 1 ml/kg.<br>
Data Analysis<br>
The social interaction data (time interacting, rearing and squares crossed) are subjected to a randomized, one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests conducted using the Student-Newman- Keuls—test.—The data—are—subjected—to—a—test—ofnormality (Shapiro-Wilk test). The data are analyzed using the GBSTAT program, version 6.5 (Dynamics Microsystems, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, 1997). All data are presented as means V S.E.M.<br>
In  Vivo  Models of the Micturition Reflex<br>
The effects of compounds on the micturition reflex are assessed in the "distension-induced rhythmic contraction" (DIRC), as described in previous publications (e.g. Maggi et al, 1987; Morikawa et al, 1992) , and Continuous Slow Transvesicular Infusion (CSTI) models in rats.<br><br>
DIRC Model<br>
Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g are anesthetized with subcutaneous urethane (1.2 g/kg). The trachea is cannulated with PE240 tubing to provide a clear airway throughout the experiment. A midline abdominal incision is made and the left and right ureters are isolated. The ureters are ligated distally (to prevent escape of fluids from the bladder) and cannulated proximally with PE10 tubing. The incision is closed using 4-0 silk sutures, leaving the PE10 lines routed to the exterior for the elimination of urine. The bladder is canulated via the transurethral route using PE50 tubing inserted 2.5 cm beyond the urethral opening. This cannula is secured to the tail using tape and connected to a pressure transducer. To prevent leakage from the bladder, the cannula is tied tightly to the exterior urethral opening using 4-0 silk.<br>
To initiate the micturition reflex, the bladder is first emptied by applying pressure to the lower abdomen, and then filled with normal saline in 100 increments (maximum - 2' ml) until spontaneous bladder contractions occurred (typically 20-40 mmHg at a rate of one contraction every 2 to 3 minutes. Once a regular rhythm is established, vehicle (saline) or Test Compounds are administered i.v. or i.p. to explore their effects on bladder activity. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 is given as a positive control. Data are expressed as contraction interval (in seconds) before drug application (basal), or after the application of vehicle or test article.<br><br>
Continuous Slow Transvesicular Infusion (CSTI) rat Model<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g are used for the study. Rats are anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p). Through a median abdominal incision, bladder is exposed and a polyethylene cannula (PE 50) is introduced into the bladder through a small cut on the dome of the bladder and the cannula is secured with a purse string suture. The other end of the cannula is exteriorized subcutaneously at the dorsal neck area. Similarly, another cannula (PE 50) is introduced into the stomach through a paramedian abdominal incision with the free end exteriorized subcutaneously to the neck region. The surgical wounds are closed with silk 4-0 suture and the animal is allowed to recover with appropriate post surgical' care. On the following day, the animal is placed in a rat restrainer. The open end of the blader cannula is connected to a ores sure transducer as well as in illusion pump through a three-way stopcock.—Thx bladder voiding cycles are initiated by continuous infusion of normal saline at the rate of 100 μl/min. The repetitive voiding contractions are recorded on a Power Lab on-line data acquisition software. After an recording the basal voiding pattern for an hour, the test drug or vehicle is administered directly into stomach through the intragastric catheter and the voiding cycles are monitored for 5 hours. Micturition pressure and frequency are calculated before and after the treatment (at every 30 min interval) for each animal. Bladder capacity is calculated from the frequency, based on the constant infusion of 100 ul/min micturition.   The effect of the test drug is<br>
expressed as a percentage of basal, pre-drug bladder capacity. WAY 100635 is used as positive control for comparison<br><br>
