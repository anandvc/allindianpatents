An object of this invention is to propqse a sponge that is bio¬compatible and has very high absorpti^itv as well as rate of absorption towards blood, water and tissue fluids, and can be used as a swab for opthalmic applications or as an haemostat or as a wound dressing material for burns, surgical or other wounds, ulcers, etc„.<br>

A further object of this invention is to propose a process for the production of a biocompatible sponge with high absorptivity towards tissue fluids such as water, blood or other.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparing modified biocompatible sponge comprising i n thr* stops of :<br>
preparing a solution of the polyvinyl alcohol of high visco¬sity;<br>
\or.    adding to the solution of the poly vinyl alcohol a surfactant<br>
••J such as herein described;<br>
?c.  mixing the solution of PVA and surfactant with an acidic<br>
solution  of  chitosan  followed by  frothing  the  mixture  thus<br>
obtained;<br>
d•  adding an aldehyde cross-linker such as herein described<br>
"and an acid catalyst to cross linker' the PVA and the chitosan<br><br>
to obtain the biocompatible sponge.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention also relates to polyvinyl acetal and poly¬aminosaccharide blend compositions, which can be l.ormuia Led in the form of foams or sponges. The natural polyaminosaccharide used in the examples of this invention is chitosan which is found abundantly in nature in crabshell, etc.. The invention is particularly useful for applications where a high absorption rate coupled with higher absorbency towards tissue fluids is desired. The invention includes the methods for making the compo¬sitions , materials and the sponge.<br>
The polyaminosaccharide used in this indention, namely chitosan was obtained from chitin by deacetylatipn using strong aqueous alkali. Chitin is a very abundant naturally occurring polysaccha-rides, consisting of B (1-4) 2 acetamido-^-^^oxy-D-glucose units. Chitosan has been used as an anti-thromnogcnio and hnomoc•ompnl: i -ble coating for artificial blood vessels Jand is acid-soluble.<br>
In this invention, a dispersion of a hiiahly acidic and viscous aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol (JPVA) with viscosity in the range of 500-800 cps is mixed with a‹ surfactant. The surfac¬tant used should have a dissociation constant of the order of<br>
-2 10   in highly acidic media. An acidic solution of the chitosan<br>
is dispersed in the solution of PVA and the mixture is frothed to its maximum extent by mechanically beating in air with a high speed stirrer. An aqueous solution of the cross linking agent when mixed with the above metioned dispersion is presented to the external surface of the foam bubble at a relatively higher cross linking density at the surface than in the interior. This phenomena causes the bubbles to be cross linked without conside¬rable collapse and leads to the formation of a sponge or foavn<br>
with uniformly small pores and proper phase mixing. While any<br>
* aldehyde that is capable of being dispersed in aqueous media<br>
is also capable of forming the sponge for greater phase mixing,<br>
it is desirable to use an aldehyde with a high reaction as glu-<br><br>
taraldehyde  or  formaldehyde,  etc..  Glutaraldehyde  is  having the added advantage that it can crosslink the chitosan moieties also effectively resulting in a better1 phase mixing for  the PVA-chitosan blend. The structure formed is ak i.n to ‹-m i nl ‹M pom-trating polymer network.<br>
In preparing the1sponges of this invention, the polyvinyl alcohol solution is prepared in a concentration of 5-2 0% by weight of PVA depending on the molecular weight used, so that the final solution viscosity is between 500-800 cps. The molecular weight of the PVA may hence vary from 10,000 to 1,25,000. For the typi¬cal medical application, the more hydrolysed grades of PVA are preferred for the invention to avoid solution formation in cold water. The aqueous acidic solution of chitosan is prepared in the range of 1-3% by weight in dilute acid. Volumes of the chito¬san solution to be added will vary with the actual desired compo¬sition. Examples of acids that may be used to dissolve the chito¬san are hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, etc..<br>
In order to obtain the sponges of the high absorptivity as claimed in this invention, the surfactants used should bo capable of decreasing the surface tension of the solution in a strongly acidic media. Examples of such surfactants are sodium lauryl sulphate, polyoxyethylene sorbitnto, oho.. Tho rniu'pnl mI i on of the surfactants used are in the range of less than 2% by weight of polyvinyl alcohol in the case of polyoxyethylene sorbi-tate, whereas higher concentrations of around 20% are required in the case of sodium lauryl sulphate, for obtaining self-sus¬taining cross linked foams of minimum shrinkage.<br>
The PVA cross-linking reaction is acid catalysed. In the produc¬tion of self-sustaining foams, the typical concentrations of the concentrated acids (35% hydrochlori,c acid) used are upto 5% of the volume of the PVA solution. The foams hence produced in the invention are light and have least amount of shrinkage. The role of the cross linker is to crosjslink the froth in the form of a self-sustaining sponge before! the forces of aravitv<br><br>
and interlamellar forces of the liquid films cnuao l:ho 1 ".roth to col lapse. Use of higher concentrations of nlclohy‹los I;PSW 1 I: in ef f inient cross linking but can al so resu ! t i n Hio !'
