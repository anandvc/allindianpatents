				<td>Introduction to the Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to an improved method and system for on-line coil weight estimation in a<br>
rolling mill<br>
In another aspect, this invention relates to a method and auto slow down mechanism for skin<br>
pass mill.<br>
Prior Art and Drawbacks:<br>
It is already known to estimate the weight of coil in a rolling mill according to the requirements of<br>
customers.<br>
It is well known that a skin pass mill is a crucial place in any cold rolling mill mainly because of the<br>
fact that its output in many cases is sent directly to the customer. With increasing availability of<br>
options to thÂ« customers, the technical specifications of their orders have been narrowing in<br>
tolerance day by day. One such exempt* is the individual coll weight very precisely specified by<br>
the customer.<br>
This is a problem for low weight coils, as it needs to be partitioned from a bigger coil. Pure visual<br>
estimation gives a rough idea of weight because slight variation in thickness or width can amount<br>
for too much variation in coil to coil weight.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
It is an object of the invention to propose an improved method to determine the specific weight of<br>
coil with very little tolerance.<br>
It is another object of this invention to determine the weight of a coil based on calcutation of<br>
instantaneous coiler diameter using ratio technique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose such a method for the determination of the weight<br>
of a coil based on the fact that for any fixed duration of time the length of strip passing over<br>
dummy roll is same as length of strip being wrapped on the coiler<br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose such a method in which using two shaft encoders<br>
attached to coiler and dummy roil respectively, we can count the number of rotations made by<br>
cotter roil and dummy roll.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose a system for the determination of the weight of a<br>
coil based on calculation of instantaneous coiler diameter using ratio technique.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to propose a system, which is based on the fact for any fixed<br>
duration of time, the length of strip passing over dummy roll is same as length of strip being<br>
wrapped on the coiler.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to propose a system in which using two shaft encoders<br>
attached to coiler and dummy roll respectively, we can count the number of rotations made by<br>
coiler roll and dummy roll.<br>
It is an additional object of the invention to propose such a system, which can not only estimate<br>
the online coil weight accurately but also stop the mill automatically after expecting a preset<br>
weight in the coiler.<br>

Figure 3 shows the portion of the system for coll weight measurement.<br>
Details of Determining the Weight of Coil:<br>
For the purpose, PLC with VHSC module, PC, shaft encoders, thumb wheel switches, selection<br>
switches and display meters were used. All other hardware were already existing in the mill.<br>
Analogue signals like stand speed feedback signal and thickness measurement signal were<br>
brought into the PLC. Some digital mill contacts like forward run, forward thread, coiler tension on<br>
etc. were also used.<br>
a. Software implementation:<br>
The measurement of coil weight in coiler required calculation of on-line diameter<br>
measurement in the first place. This diameter was converted to volume by using strip width<br>
information finally based upon this volume weight was calculated.<br>
For auto slow down length information was needed and this was calculated with the help of<br>
thickness information of the strip. The various measurement methods have been described in<br>
the following part in order they were needed and developed.<br>
b. Outer diameter measurement:<br>
An incremental shaft encoder is fitted on a dummy roll in the coiler side, the contact of strip<br>
with dummy roll should be such that minimum or null slippage occurs. For a very small time<br>
period (025 sec max.), the number of rotations made by dummy roll (Ndummy) and coiler<br>
mandrel (Ncoiler) are measured through very high speed counter module in the PLC. If the<br>
fixed diameter of dummy roll is Odummy, assuming no slippage, outer coiler diameter<br>
Dcoiler can be given by<br>
Dcoiler = {Ndummy/Ncoiler} * Ddummy................(1)<br>
c. Auto slowdown mechanism for skin pass mill:<br>
i. In order to facilitate partitioning of higher weight input coils into coils of lower weights,<br>
the operator has been provided with a feature for stand speed feedback signal is also<br>
brought to the PLC. This is required in order to calculate the expected length of coil<br>
(slow down length) which will be wrapped in the coiler if mill is stopped now with<br>
normal deceleration. The expected weight of slow down length is also calculated<br>
length matches with 'set output weight", slow down is initiated automatically.<br>
ii. For provision of auto slow down of mill at tail end of the coil, no extra input other than<br>
mentioned above was required. The slow down is initiated based upon the<br>
calculation of remaining coil length in uncoiler and coil length expected to stop the<br>
mill to standstill from present mill speed. Normally coil in uncoiler is not as tightly<br>
packed as coiler and also the contact of strip with uncoiler side deflector roll is not<br>
very good. This may lead to miscalculation of diameter, which in turn may affect the<br>
calculation of remaining coif length in uncoiler.<br>
d. Weight calculation formulate based on diameter of coil. Since the diameter of each winding<br>
consistently varies, how do you estimate diameter of the coil? The coil weight estimation is<br>
based on calculation of instantaneous coiler diameter using ratio technique. For any fixed<br>
duration of time, the length of strip passing over dummy rod is same as length of strip being<br>
wrapped on the coiler. Using two shaft encoders attached to coiler and dummy roll<br>
respectively, we can count the number of rotations made by coiler roll and dummy roll. Ratio<br>
of diameter is equated with inverse ratio of number of rotations made by the two rolls. Since<br>
only coiler diameter is only variable in the equation, it can be calculated.<br>
Coiler weight measurement:<br>
Weight of coil in coiler is estimated indirectly using online coiier diameter as main parameter.<br>
Other parameters used for such estimation are strip width (SW) and specific gravity of steel<br>
(5 steel).<br>
The volume of the coil can be given as<br>
Vcoil = Pi/4* (Dcoiler2 - Did2)* SW where Did is the internal diameter of coil and equals to<br>
the fixed diameter of coiler mandrel.<br>
Therefore, the weight of the coil can be given as<br>
Wcoil = Pi/4 (Dcoiler2 - Did2)* SW* d steel....................(2)<br>
e. Coiler length measurement:<br>
As we shall see in the auto stow down scheme that coil length measurement is very crucial to<br>
the accuracy of final coil weight.<br>
One important factor required for length calculation is strip thickness, which was obtained<br>
from existing gamma ray thickness measurement system and the average thickness (t) was<br>
used for the calculation of coil length.<br>
Assuming that strip is tightly would and there is no gap between successive turns of the strip,<br>
the coil can be assumed as a very long strip of steel with length (I), thickness (t), width (SW)<br>
and specific gravity (d steel).<br>
The weight of such strip can be given by<br><br>
Wcoil=1* SW*t*d steel......................(3)<br>
From equation (2) and (3) length of the coil can be calculated as<br>
L = Pi/(4*1) * (Dcoiler2 - Did2)..................(4).<br>
Calibration details:<br>
The estimated weight in the coiler deviates by less than 3% of actual weight measured through<br>
weight bridge system. The data is attached for reference.<br>
Fault diagnoses details:<br>
Dynamic mimic displays on the terminal depicting many useful data to enable easy fault<br>
diagnostics of the mill. Figure for the same is attached.<br>
In actual trial runs made at different times at different dates, it has been found that in some cases,<br>
the actual weight and calculated weight of the coil were almost same with an error of -0.12% very<br>
negligible recordal of less weight.<br>
Similarly, it has also been observed that a higher weight recordai of up to about 5.6% than the<br>
calculated weight has been found.<br>
These variations are attributed to several operational adjustments and it is possible to obtain very<br>
negligible error in weight determination.<br>

material from an uncoiler roll to pass through a nip provided between a pair of work<br>
rolls and winding the so passed coil end on a coiler roll, the coil end from the uncoiler<br>
roll being deflected in a first deflecting zone to the nip position as necessary and<br>
being further deflected in a second deflecting zone to the coiler roll from the nip as<br>
necessary, each of the said two deflection zones being provided with respective shaft<br>
encoding to provide necessary information such as coil length passing there between<br>
to a measurement and central zone, the measurement and central zone also having<br>
information from the uncoiler zone and coiler zone through tacho information about<br>
amount of coil un-coiled respectively, there being a control panel associated to the<br>
measurement and central zone; the measurement and control details being further<br>
processed in a development and process monitoring zone to provide information like<br>
instantaneous thickness, main stand roll force, instantaneous coil weight in coiler and<br>
uncoiler, total length rolled in a campaign to facilitate roll change, the information<br>
thus made available in said process monitoring zone being displayed in a display zone<br>
with a report printing zone providing process report, the coil weight in the coiler roll<br>
being determined based on instantaneous coiler diameter using a ratio technique,<br>
where, the instantaneous coiler diameter is determined as a ratio between the number<br>
of rotations made by the uncoiler roll and toiler roll, said number of respective<br>
rotations being made known the above said respective tacho mechanism associated<br>
with the respective deflection zones for the uncoiler and coiler zones, the length and<br>
instantaneous diameter of the coil being used to determine the volume of the coil with<br>
the help of coil width followed by converting the coil volume into weight with the<br>
help of the specific gravity of the material of the coils.<br>
There is also provided a system therefore.</td>
