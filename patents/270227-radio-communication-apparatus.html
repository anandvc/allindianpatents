RADIO COMMUNICATION APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a radio<br>
communication apparatus, and, in particular, to network<br>
communication with the use of a data transmission<br>
network such as a LAN (Local Area Network), a PAN<br>
(Personal Area Network) or such, inter-apparatus<br>
communication between a personal computer and a<br>
peripheral such as a multi-function peripheral (MFP),<br>
and intra-apparatus communication in a PC, a MFP or such.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, a USB (Universal Serial Bus) has<br>
been widely used as a means for achieving data<br>
transmission between a host terminal such as a personal<br>
computer (PC) and a peripheral such as a keyboard, a<br>
mouse, a printer, a modem or such. USB is a standard of<br>
data transmission, and, is originally directed to wired<br>
communication. However, recently, for the purpose of<br>
user's convenience, application to wireless<br>
communication thereof is in progress.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an example of a configuration of<br><br>
a common radio communication apparatus. As shown in FIG.<br>
1, the radio communication apparatus 1 is connected with<br>
a PC system 2 by means of a system bus 3 such as a PCI<br>
(Peripheral Component Interface), a USB or such. The<br>
radio communication apparatus 1 receives data<br>
transmitted from an external apparatus via radio<br>
communication, and transmits the received data to the PC<br>
system 2 by means of the system bus 3. The radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 may be incorporated in the PC<br>
system 2. In order to thus receive data transmitted<br>
from the external apparatus by means of the radio<br>
communication and then to transmit the same to the PC<br>
system 2, the radio communication apparatus 1 has a MAC<br>
(Media Access Control) part 11, a PHY (physical layer)<br>
part 12 and a RF (Radio Frequency) part 13. The MAC<br>
part 11 acts as a transmission control part for<br>
controlling data transmission between the PC system. 2<br>
and the external apparatus. The PHY part 12 acts as a<br>
physical layer defining network physical connection and<br>
transmission method. The RF part 13 acts as a radio<br>
input/output part for carrying out data<br>
transmission/reception with the external apparatus by<br>
air.<br>
It is assumed that the radio communication<br>
apparatus 1 of FIG. 1 carries out radio communication<br><br>
with the external apparatus by means of wireless USB.<br>
In this case, an interface between the MAC part 11 and<br>
the PHY part 12 is compliance with WiMedia MAC-PHY<br>
interface specifications. WiMedia is a lower layer<br>
standard, and is designed in such a manner that various<br>
upper layer protocols (WiNet, Wirelessl394, Bluetooth<br>
(registered trade name) and so forth) can coexist. A<br>
radio communication apparatus which mounts WiMedia has a<br>
CCA_STATUS (Clear Channel Assessment Status) signal<br>
indicating a state of a radio wave of the radio<br>
communication, in the MAC-PHY interface. The CCA_STATUS<br>
signal is activated by the PHY part 12 when a signal<br>
level of a radio medium signal received by the RF part<br>
13 exceeds a predetermined level.<br>
Further, according to the WiMedia standard, a<br>
means for avoiding communication collision between<br>
apparatuses which mount this standard is provided.<br>
However, no means is provided for avoiding collision<br>
with a radio communication apparatus which is not<br>
compatible with this standard, or another apparatus<br>
which generates a noise in a common frequency band.. A<br>
problem thus occurring will now be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows one example of a<br>
wireless system including a PC and a peripheral. In FIG.<br>
2, the PC 21 carries out data transmission with a multi-<br><br>
function peripheral (MFP) 22 by means of radio<br>
communication according to the WiMedia standard. In<br>
this case, when, in neighborhood of the PC 21 and the<br>
MFP 22, there is another apparatus which generates a<br>
noise of a frequency band the same as the radio<br>
communication frequency between the PC 21 and the MFP 22,<br>
the radio communication between the PC 21 and the MFP 22<br>
may be affected. As a result, stable communication<br>
quality may not be ensured.<br>
For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent<br>
Application No. 11-150756 discloses communication<br>
facilities in which collision can be avoided even when<br>
the same sub-frequency bands are simultaneously captured<br>
between different radio stations. The radio facilities<br>
include a plurality of radio systems including at least<br>
one radio station. The radio system transmits a pulse,<br>
previously controlled in the sub-frequency band before<br>
transmitting an effective signal. As a result, it is<br>
possible to determine whether or not it has occupied the<br>
sub-frequency band different from that of the other<br>
radio system.<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2003-<br>
46515 discloses a radio communication apparatus by which<br>
radio communication between a radio parent apparatus and<br>
a radio child apparatus can be positively carried out as<br><br>
a result of a radio channel having a noise mixed which<br>
affects the radio communication being previously<br>
detected. This radio communication apparatus carries<br>
out carrier sensing in sequence on frequencies which may<br>
affect the radio communication other than a carrier<br>
frequency of a radio channel to actually apply. Then,<br>
when a test frequency exceeding a predetermined value in<br>
a carrier sensing level is detected, a channel<br>
corresponding to the test frequency is determined as a<br>
noise-mixed channel in which the noise is mixed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, the above-mentioned communication<br>
facilities of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 11-<br>
150756 transmit a pulse-like radio wave for determining<br>
whether or not the same sub-frequency band is<br>
simultaneously captured between different radio stations.<br>
Thereby, a noise may be generated therefrom. Further,<br>
in the above-mentioned radio communication apparatus of<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 2003-46515,<br>
whether or not a channel can be actually used can be<br>
determined only from whether or not a carrier is<br>
included therein.<br>
In consideration of these problems, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide a radio<br><br>
communication apparatus by which an influence of a noise<br>
can be avoided as a result of the noise of a frequency<br>
band upon communication being quantitatively evaluated.<br>
In order to achieve the object, according to<br>
the present invention, a radio communication apparatus<br>
includes noise detecting means for detecting a noise of<br>
a frequency band upon communication; determining means<br>
for determining whether or not the thus-detected noise<br>
exceeds a predetermined level; and communication<br>
changing means for changing the frequency band and/or a<br>
communication radio field intensity based on a<br>
determination result of said determining means.<br>
Thereby, such a radio communication apparatus<br>
can be provided in which it is possible to<br>
quantitatively evaluate a noise in a frequency band upon<br>
communication, and to avoid an influence of the noise.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, according to the present<br>
invention, a radio communication apparatus includes<br>
noise detecting means for detecting a noise of a<br>
frequency band upon communication; determining means for<br>
determining whether or not the thus-detected noise<br><br>
exceeds a predetermined level; and communication<br>
changing means for changing the frequency band and/or a<br>
communication radio field intensity based on a<br>
determination result of said determining means.<br>
Thereby, such a radio communication apparatus<br>
can be provided in which it is possible to<br>
quantitatively evaluate a noise in a frequency band upon<br>
communication, and to avoid an influence of the noise.<br>
According to a best mode for carrying out the present<br>
invention, by detecting a CCA_STATUS signal and a<br>
PHY_ACTIVE (Physical Layer Active Indication) signal<br>
provided in the WiMedia MAC-PHY interface specifications<br>
together, it is detected whether or not a frequency band<br>
upon communication is affected by a noise from another<br>
apparatus or such, and, when the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by the noise from the other<br>
apparatus or such, switching is made to another<br>
available frequency band which is not affected, or, a<br>
communication field intensity is sufficiently increased<br>
so that an influence of the noise may not appear. As a<br>
result, it is possible to ensure proper communication<br>
quality in the radio communication apparatus.<br>
Preferably, the radio communication apparatus<br>
may further have a measuring time timer for setting a<br>
time for the noise detecting means to detect the noise.<br><br>
Thereby, it is possible to determine a factor<br>
actually affecting communication of the radio<br>
communication apparatus. As a result, it is possible to<br>
take suitable measures (for example, to switch a<br>
frequency band, or to increase a communication field<br>
intensity or such).<br>
Or, preferably, the radio communication<br>
apparatus may further has intensity determining means<br>
for detecting the level of the noise.<br>
Thereby, when the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by a noise from another<br>
apparatus or such, it is possible to appropriately<br>
adjust a signal level of the frequency band upon<br>
communication so as to avoid the influence of the noise.<br>
Or, preferably, the radio communication<br>
apparatus may further have intensity threshold setting<br>
means for setting a threshold for the noise detecting<br>
means to detect the noise.<br>
Thereby, when the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by a noise from another<br>
apparatus or such, it is possible to appropriately<br>
adjust a signal level of the frequency band upon<br>
communication so as to avoid the influence of the noise.<br>
In particular, in comparison to the above-mentioned<br>
radio communication apparatus having the intensity<br><br>
determining means, it is possible to obtain<br>
approximately the same advantage with a simpler<br>
configuration.<br>
Or, preferably, the threshold may have<br>
hysteresis characteristics.<br>
Thereby, even when the signal level<br>
fluctuates around the threshold, it is possible to<br>
obtain a stable noise evaluation result.<br>
Thus, according to the best mode for carrying<br>
out the present invention, it is possible to<br>
quantitatively evaluate a noise in a frequency band upon<br>
communication, so as to avoid an influence of a noise.<br>
Next, the best mode for carrying out the<br>
present invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to figures.<br>
As described above, the radio communication<br>
apparatus in the related art mounting WiMedia has the<br>
CCA_STATUS signal indicating a signal state of radio<br>
communication. Actually, a method for using this signal<br>
is not particularly prescribed, and should be determined<br>
by an apparatus designer. Therefore, according to the<br>
best mode for carrying out the present invention, the<br>
signal is utilized to carry out noise evaluation of a<br>
frequency band upon communication.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a configuration of a MAC part<br><br>
included in a radio communication apparatus according to<br>
the best mode for carrying out the present invention.<br>
The other parts of the radio communication<br>
apparatus according to the best mode for carrying out<br>
the present invention may be the same as those of the<br>
radio communication apparatus 1 mounting WiMedia<br>
described above as the related art with reference to FIG.<br>
1, and descriptions thereof are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the MAC part 300 includes<br>
a control part 31, a PC interface (IF) 32, a TX<br>
(transmission) block 33, a RX (reception) block 34, a<br>
transmission/reception data buffer 35 and a noise<br>
evaluating part 36. The control part 31 controls the<br>
respective parts of the MAC part 300, and includes a CPU<br>
(Central Processing Unit) and a ROM (Read Only Memory).<br>
The PC interface 32 acts as an input/output part for<br>
carrying out data transmission/reception with the PC<br>
system 2. The TX block 33 acts as a transmitting part<br>
for transmitting data to the PHY part 12. The RX block<br>
34 acts as a receiving part for receiving data from the<br>
PHY part 12. The transmission/reception data buffer 35<br>
acts as a storing part for temporarily storing data<br>
which is received from the PC system 2 via the PC<br>
interface 32 to be transmitted to the PHY part 12 by<br>
means of the TX block 33, as well as data which is<br><br>
received from the PHY part 12 by means of the RX block<br>
34 to be transmitted to the PC system 2 by means of the<br>
PC interface 32. The noise evaluating part 36 is a part<br>
for evaluating a noise in a frequency band currently<br>
used in radio communication with an external apparatus.<br>
Next, several embodiments (examples) of the<br>
best mode for carrying out the present invention for<br>
evaluation of a radio channel in the MAC part will be<br>
described.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
FIG. 4 shows a first example of a<br>
configuration of the MAC part according to the best mode<br>
for carrying out the present invention. It is noted<br>
that, in FIG. 4, only part of the MAC part is shown, and,<br>
thus, only components for describing operations<br>
concerning the best mode for carrying out the present<br>
invention are shown.<br>
In the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4, the noise<br>
evaluating part 36a has a measuring time timer 361, a<br>
noise detecting part 362 and a determining part 363.<br>
The measuring time timer 361 acts as a clock<br>
of a counting down type, for measuring a predetermined<br>
measuring time. The noise detecting part 362 acts as a<br>
part for detecting a noise of a frequency band upon<br><br>
communication, recording a time (actually, counting the<br>
number of given predetermined clock pulses) during which<br>
the CCA_STATUS signal indicating a signal state of radio<br>
communication output from the PHY part is active and<br>
also the PHY_ACTIVE signal is active during the<br>
measuring time, and outputting the recording result as a<br>
CCA_VALUE signal indicating a CCA_VALUE value. That is,<br>
the CCA_STATUS signal is a signal indicating that a<br>
signal level (i.e., the level of the radio medium<br>
signal) of the frequency band upon communication<br>
received by the RF part 13 of the radio communication<br>
apparatus 1 is equal to or more than the predetermined<br>
level, as mentioned above, and, assuming that the<br>
predetermined level corresponds to a level at which a<br>
signal used in the radio communication is affected, it<br>
can be determined that, when the CCA_STATUS signal is<br>
active, some radio wave is generated in such a level<br>
that it affects the radio communication in the frequency<br>
band used for the radio communication.<br>
The above-mentioned level at which the radio<br>
communication is affected corresponds to a level at<br>
which some trouble occurs in the radio communication,<br>
and depends on transmission/reception power and a data<br>
rate of the radio communication. That is, in a case<br>
where the radio communication is carried out with low<br><br>
transmission/reception power, the influence appears even<br>
from a noise of low power, while, in a case where the<br>
radio communication is carried out with high<br>
transmission/reception power, the influence may not much<br>
arise from a noise of such a low power. Further, proper<br>
communication may be ensured thanks to an error<br>
correction function having high redundancy while the<br>
radio communication is carried out with a low date rate,<br>
while, in a case where the radio communication is<br>
carried out with a high data rate, proper communication<br>
may not be ensured since only error correction with low<br>
redundancy is available in the situation. Therefore, a<br>
threshold for activating the CCA_STATUS signal is<br>
determined with the use of a lookup table with respect<br>
to the transmission/reception power and the data rate<br>
currently used for the radio communication.<br>
It is noted that, only from the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal, it is not possible to determine whether or not a<br>
radio wave appearing is one generated for the purpose of<br>
the radio communication of the WiMedia radio<br>
communication apparatus of the own station or another<br>
station, or, the radio wave appearing is one acting as a<br>
noise factor generated from a radio wave source other<br>
than these WiMedia radio communication apparatuses,<br>
against the WiMedia radio communication apparatuses. In<br><br>
order to determine whether the radio wave appearing<br>
corresponds to one from the WiMedia radio communication<br>
apparatuses or others, the above-mentioned PHY_ACTIVE<br>
signal provided according to the WiMedia standard is<br>
used. The PHY_ACTIVE signal is a signal provided from<br>
WiMedia-PHY (i.e., the PHY part 12 of FIG. 1) to<br>
WiMedia-MAC (i.e., the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4,<br>
corresponding to the MAC part 11 of FIG. 1), and, is<br>
activated when the WiMedia-PHY transmits or receives a<br>
radio wave of the WiMedia standard. That is, when a<br>
radio wave which the WiMedia-PHY receives is not one of<br>
the WiMedia standard, the PHY_ACTIVE signal is not<br>
activated or is deactivated. Therefrom, it is possible<br>
to determine that the received radio wave may act as a<br>
noise factor against the WiMedia radio wave when the<br>
received radio wave is received with the PHY_ACTIVE<br>
signal being deactivated and the CCA_STATUS signal being<br>
activated. Accordingly, it can be determined that a<br>
noise is detected in the frequency band upon<br>
communication, when the following requirements are met,<br>
i.e.,<br>
CCA_STATUS = active, and also, PHY_ACTIVE =<br>
deactive<br><br>
There, 'deactive' means a state of being<br>
deactivated, and, the same manner is applied also<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Further, the above-mentioned CCA_VALUE signal<br>
output from the nose detection part 362 as the<br>
measurement result of the CCA_STATUS signal and the<br>
PHY_ACTIVE signal is a value indicating a rate at which<br>
a signal having a level equal to or more than the<br>
predetermined level appears during the measuring time,<br>
and, is used as a measure to determine whether or not<br>
the radio frequency band upon communication is affected<br>
by a noise. The determining part 363 acts as a part for<br>
determining whether or not the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by a noise from another<br>
apparatus or such based on the CCA_VALUE signal output<br>
from the noise detecting part 362.<br>
Further, in the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4, the<br>
control part 31a has a notifying part 311 and a<br>
communication changing part 312.<br>
The notifying part 311 acts as a part for<br>
notifying of a determination result of the determining<br>
means 363 of the noise evaluating means 36a, to the PC<br>
system 2. The communication changing part 312 acts as a<br>
part for outputting a switching instruction to the PHY<br>
part 12 by means of communication with a SERIAL_DATA<br><br>
signal for the PHY part 12 to change the frequency band<br>
upon communication and/or a communication radio field<br>
intensity, according to the determination result of the<br>
determining part 363 of the noise evaluating part 36a.<br>
Next, an operation procedure of the MAC part<br>
300a of FIG. 4, described above, is described.<br>
First, the control part 31a sets a value<br>
'start_value', as a measuring time for the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal in the measuring time timer 361. The measuring<br>
time may be set to adapt to an expected interference<br>
factor when a particular interference factor is expected<br>
which may affect the frequency band used for<br>
communication. For example, as the expectable<br>
particular interference factor for when communication is<br>
carried out in a server room or such, since it is<br>
expected that the server room is operated regularly, the<br>
measuring time is set such that, measurement of 10<br>
seconds is carried out 30 times with an interval of 1<br>
minute each therebetween. In another example, for when<br>
a microwave oven may affect communication, since the<br>
microwave oven is used continuously for several minutes<br>
ordinarily, the measuring time is set such that<br>
measurement of one minute is carried out three times<br>
with an interval of 5 minutes each therebetween. In<br>
further another example, for when radio communication<br><br>
carried out by a PC may affect communication, since it<br>
is expected that a radio wave is generated sporadically<br>
within a short duration each time with an interval of<br>
tens of milliseconds each therebetween, the measuring<br>
time is set such that continuous measurement of ten<br>
minutes is carried out once. For when none of<br>
particular interference factors is expected, past noise<br>
evaluation results are previously stored in a storage<br>
device (not shown) of the control part 31, and, an<br>
attempt is made to set such a measuring time with<br>
priority, which corresponds to a value in which noise<br>
detection occurred most frequently. As a result, it is<br>
possible to evaluate a noise pattern within the smallest<br>
number of procedures. It is also possible to measure a<br>
noise only when the own station carries out or does not<br>
carry out communication. When, from the measurement<br>
result, it is determined that, a noise was detected only<br>
when the own station carried out communication, and also,<br>
no noise was detected when the own station did not carry<br>
out communication, a. radio wave from the own station may<br>
have acted as the noise due to reflection. Accordingly,<br>
in such a case, it is possible to avoid the noise<br>
problem by lowering the transmission power level of the<br>
own station. The above-mentioned setting of the<br>
measuring time will be described in more detail.<br><br>
[Setting for when a server room or such may affect<br>
communication]<br>
In an environment in which a noise source<br>
operates constantly such as in a server room, it is<br>
expected that the same noise occurs with approximately<br>
in a fixed frequency band. As a method to presume it,<br>
noise measurement is made during a continuous time, for<br>
example, 1 or 2 hours. In this case, when a noise is<br>
detected at a high detection rate such as that equal to<br>
or more than 95 % as a result of the measurement during<br>
the above-mentioned measuring time, it can be determined<br>
that a noise source exists which generates a noise<br>
constantly in the measured location. For the purpose of<br>
carrying out the measurement for such a continuous long<br>
time, appropriate hardware is required, and thus,<br>
hardware cost may increase. In order to solve this<br>
problem, a method may be used in which, instead of<br>
carrying out the measurement during a continuous long<br>
time, the noise measurement is made discretely. For<br>
example, continuous measurement of ten seconds is made<br>
60 times with an interval of 1 minute each therebetween.<br>
Thereby, even though the actual measurement time is<br>
total 600 seconds (= 10 [seconds] X 60 [times]), it is<br>
possible to evaluate an average noise during one hour<br><br>
(= (10 [seconds] + 1 [minutes])X 60 [times]).<br>
Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the hardware<br>
required for the noise measurement.<br>
[Setting for when a microwave oven is expected]<br>
It is known that a frequency band of a<br>
microwave oven is 2.4 GHz band and affects a frequency<br>
band used by wireless LAN. In an environment in which<br>
an apparatus which emits a radio wave such as a<br>
microwave oven, an electromagnetic cooking machine or<br>
such operates, intermittent uses thereof each during<br>
minutes through tens of minutes are expected from its<br>
common operation manner. In order to presume an actual<br>
operation environment, the following noise measurement<br>
method may be used. That is, immediately after a start<br>
of radio communication of the radio communication<br>
apparatus, or when it is detected that communication<br>
quality degrades after the radio communication is<br>
carried out for a while, noise measurement of a<br>
continues long time is carried out (for example, for 10<br>
minutes or 30 minutes). Then, when such a measurement<br>
result thereof is obtained therefrom that, a constant<br>
noise condition has continued (for example, due to<br>
operation of a microwave oven) for a fixed time from<br>
immediately after the measurement, and, then, after an<br><br>
elapse of the fixed time, the noise condition has<br>
improved (as a result of the use of the microwave oven<br>
being finished), it can be presumed that such an<br>
apparatus as a microwave oven, which generates a radio<br>
wave only during minutes, operated. In order to reduce<br>
required resources for the noise measurement in this<br>
case, the same as the above-mentioned case, the noise<br>
measurement may be made discretely, i.e., the<br>
measurement of ten seconds is repeated with an interval<br>
of 1 minute each therebetween, or so. In noise<br>
evaluation for 30 minutes in which continuous<br>
measurement of ten seconds is repeated with an interval<br>
of 1 minute each therebetween as mentioned above, merely<br>
measurement resources for 300 minutes are required.<br>
[Setting for when a radio communication wave of another<br>
radio apparatus is expected]<br>
When another radio communication apparatus<br>
not compliance with the WiMedia standard carries out<br>
communication, the radio communication wave may affect<br>
communication as a noise. In order to presume the<br>
operation environment in this case, the following noise<br>
measuring method may be used. That is, noise<br>
measurement of a relatively short time (for example, ten<br>
seconds, 30 seconds or such) is repeated with an<br><br>
interval (for example, 1 minute) each therebetween.<br>
Then, in a case where, from the measurement of the short<br>
time each, a noise rate is not zero but not so large<br>
(for example, more than 0 % and less than 95 %, or such),<br>
it can be presumed that another radio communication<br>
apparatus operates. That is, in recent radio<br>
communication, i.e., typically, IEEE802.1l as a typical<br>
one, beacon frames generating communication basic<br>
information with fixed intervals are transmitted, where<br>
the frame transmission is carried out several time per<br>
second, and transmission/reception frame spans are<br>
prescribed in the specifications. There, intervals in<br>
which no radio wave transmission is allowed exist, and<br>
thus, the noise detection rate should not amount to<br>
100 % during the measuring time.<br>
A noise pattern detected from the measurement<br>
is stored in the storage device in the control part 31a.<br>
Then, when noise detection is carried out subsequently,<br>
the past noise patterns thus stored in the storage<br>
device are read. At this time, the noise patterns<br>
should be read in such an order that those which have<br>
been detected more are read earlier. As a result, the<br>
noise patterns are read in such an order that noise<br>
patterns of environments a particular user more<br>
frequently use are read earlier. As a result, it is<br><br>
possible to effectively reduce the number of procedures<br>
required for the noise detection.<br>
Returning to FIG. 4, the control part 31a<br>
sets a threshold for the CCA_VALUE value acting as a<br>
measure to determine whether or not the frequency band<br>
upon communication is affected by a noise, in the<br>
determining part 363. For example, the threshold of<br>
40 % or 60 % of the above-mentioned value 'start_value'<br>
is set. That is, in this case, when the time in which<br>
the CCA_STATUS signal is active and also the PHY_ACTIVE<br>
signal is deactive exceeds 40 % or 60 % of the measuring<br>
time (i.e., the value 'start_value') of the measuring<br>
time timer 361, which value corresponds to the CCA_VALUE<br>
value, the determining part 363 activates a Channel_Busy<br>
signal as will be described later.<br>
After setting each value, the noise<br>
evaluating part 36a starts measurement of the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal and the PHY_ACTIVE signal output from the PHY<br>
part 122. At this time, in order that the measuring<br>
time timer 361 starts time measurement (i.e., counting<br>
down), the control part 31a activates a timer_start<br>
signal input to the measuring time timer 361. After the<br>
timer_start signal is activated, the measuring time<br>
timer 361 starts the time measurement. The measuring<br>
time timer 361 activates a signal indicating 'upon<br><br>
measurement' during the time measurement. This signal<br>
is input to the noise detecting part 362. During a time<br>
in which the signal indicating "upon measurement" is<br>
thus activated, the noise detecting part 362 counts<br>
given predetermined clock pulses during a time in which<br>
the CCA_STATUS signal output by the PHY part 12 is<br>
active and also the PHY_ACTIVE signal is deactive. That<br>
is, a time period in which the detected signal level of<br>
the frequency band upon communication of the radio<br>
medium signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 is equal to or more than the<br>
predetermined level due to an influence of a noise from<br>
another apparatus or such is recorded.<br>
When the count value of the measuring time<br>
timer 361 becomes zero, this meaning that the measuring<br>
time set before the measurement in the measuring time<br>
timer 361 has elapsed, the measuring time timer 361<br>
deactivates the signal indicating "upon measurement".<br>
The noise detecting part 362 responds thereto, to output<br>
the record result of the number of the thus-counted<br>
clock pulses during the time in which the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal is active and also the PHY_ACTIVE signal is<br>
deactive, to the determining part 363 as the CCA_VALUE<br>
value. The determining part 363 determines whether or<br>
not the CCA_VALUE value output from the noise detecting<br><br>
part 362 exceeds the threshold set before the<br>
measurement by the control part 31a. When the CCA_VALUE<br>
value exceeds the threshold, the determining part 363<br>
determines that the frequency band upon communication is<br>
affected by a noise of another apparatus or such, and<br>
activates the above-mentioned Channel_Busy signal<br>
indicating an occupied situation of the frequency band.<br>
Further, after the elapse of the measuring<br>
time, the measuring time timer 361 activates a timer_end<br>
signal for notifying the control part 31a of the end of<br>
the measurement. After the timer_end signal is thus<br>
activated, the control part 31a checks the state of the<br>
Channel_Busy signal. When the Channel_Busy signal is<br>
activated by the determining part 363, the control part<br>
31a uses the notifying part 311 to notify the PC system<br>
2 that the frequency band upon communication is affected<br>
by a noise of another apparatus or such.<br>
The PC system 2 thus receiving the<br>
notification from the notifying part 311 of the control<br>
part 31a carries out any one(s) of the following<br>
operations, depending circumstances of a corresponding<br>
application program:<br>
(1-1) When it is determined, from such<br>
determination notification from the MAC part 300a, that<br>
a noise appears constantly as in a server room or such,<br><br>
but it is expected that no noise appears in another<br>
available frequency band, the currently used frequency<br>
band is switched to the other one in which it is thus<br>
expected that no noise appears. Then, the above-<br>
mentioned noise measurement is executed again.<br>
(1-2) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, also it<br>
is expected that a noise appears the same in any other<br>
available frequency bands, and thus, communication seems<br>
difficult to carry out, the radio communication is<br>
stopped.<br>
(1-3) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, also it<br>
is expected that a noise appears the same in any other<br>
available frequency bands, and thus, communication is<br>
difficult to carry out, an attempt is made to increase<br>
transmission radio field intensity of the own station so<br>
as to overcome the influence of the noise.<br>
(1-4) When a noise appears during a certain<br>
long time zone as a noise from an apparatus such as a<br>
microwave oven, but, from the past experience, it can be<br>
expected that the noise situation may improve after an<br>
elapse of a time of minutes, tens of minutes or such,<br>
the above-mentioned noise evaluation is carried out<br>
again after an elapse of such a fixed time. Thus,<br><br>
waiting is carried cut until the frequency band to use<br>
becomes unoccupied.<br>
(1-5) When the detected noise does not<br>
correspond to WiMedia and it is determined that this<br>
corresponds to a PC radio communication wave, and also,<br>
the PC of the own station mounts a radio communication<br>
apparatus itself generating the PC radio communication<br>
wave, an instruction is transmitted for an appropriate<br>
correction of transmission power to the radio<br>
communication apparatus of the PC of the own station.<br>
Further, the control part 31a not only<br>
notifies the PC system 2 that the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by a noise from another<br>
apparatus or such, but also it may use the communication<br>
changing part 312 to provide an instruction to the PHY<br>
part 12 to cause it to switch the frequency band upon<br>
communication into another frequency band. In this case,<br>
the radio communication apparatus 1, in which the MAC<br>
part 300a is included as the MAC part 11 in the<br>
embodiment 1 (first example), carries out the following<br>
operation by the functions of the PHY part 12 and the RF<br>
part 13 thereof:<br>
(1-6) With the use of the frequency band<br>
currently used for the radio communication, it is<br>
notified to a radio communication apparatus on the other<br><br>
side of the radio communication that the frequency band<br>
is to be switched. Then, after agreement is made<br>
between the radio communication apparatus 1 and the<br>
other radio communication apparatus for the switching<br>
the frequency band, the frequency band upon the radio<br>
communication is switched to another frequency band.<br>
It is noted that, although the description<br>
has been made as if the communication changing part 312<br>
of the control part 31a and the noise detecting part 362<br>
of the noise evaluating part 36a make<br>
transmission/reception of the signals with the PHY part<br>
12 directly, the TX block 33 and the RX block 34 are<br>
used actually there.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
FIG. 5 shows a second example (embodiment 2)<br>
of the configuration of the MAC part in the best mode<br>
for carrying out the present invention. It is noted<br>
that FIG. 5 shows only part of the MAC part for<br>
describing operations of the embodiment 2 according to<br>
the best mode for carrying out the present invention.<br>
The MAC part 300b of FIG. 5 is different from<br>
the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 in that the noise evaluating<br>
part 36b further has an intensity determining part 364<br>
for determining the signal level (i.e., signal<br><br>
intensity) upon communication of the radio medium signal<br>
received by the RF part 13 of the radio communication<br>
apparatus 1. All the other components have the same<br>
functions as those of the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 and<br>
carry out the same operations.<br>
The intensity determining part 364 has the<br>
above-mentioned signal indicating "upon measurement"<br>
from the measuring time timer 3 61 input thereto. During<br>
a time in which the signal indicating "upon measurement"<br>
is active, the intensity determining part 364 receives a<br>
CCA_STRENGTH signal indicating the signal level in the<br>
frequency band upon communication of the radio medium<br>
signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1, and records the same. After<br>
that, when the signal indicating "upon measurement" from<br>
the measuring time timer 361 is deactivated, the<br>
intensity determining part 364 calculates, from the<br>
thus-recorded values of the CCA_STRENGTH signal, a<br>
maximum value CCA_STRENGTH_MAX and an average<br>
CCA_STRENGTH_AVE thereof, and outputs the same to the<br>
control part 31b. It is noted that, actually, the<br>
intensity determining part 364 may record the<br>
CCA_STRENGTH signal in predetermined clock timing as a<br>
sequence of instantaneous values corresponding to the<br>
respective ones of the clock timing during the time of<br><br>
"upon measurement", sum the thus-recorded values and,<br>
therefrom, calculate; the maximum value CCA_STRENGTH MAX<br>
and the average CCA__STRENGTH_AVE.<br>
The control part 31b can thus grasp the<br>
signal levels in the frequency band upon communication<br>
of the radio medium signal received by the RF part 13 of<br>
the radio communication apparatus 1, from the values<br>
CCA_STRENGTH_MAX and CCA_STRENGTH_AVE thus output from<br>
the intensity determining part 364. When the above-<br>
mentioned Channel_Busy signal is activated by the<br>
determining part 363, the control part 31b can use the<br>
notifying part 311, to notifies the PC system 2 of the<br>
information of the signal levels of the radio medium<br>
signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 as well as that the frequency<br>
band upon communication is affected by a noise from<br>
another apparatus or such.<br>
The PC system 2 thus receiving the<br>
notification from the control part 31b, carries out any<br>
one(s) of the following operations, depending<br>
circumstances of a corresponding application program:<br>
(2-1) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, but it<br>
is expected that no noise appears in another available<br>
frequency band, the currently used frequency band is<br><br>
switched to the other one in which it is thus expected<br>
that no noise appears. Then, the above-mentioned noise<br>
measurement is executed again.<br>
(2-2) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, it is<br>
expected that also a noise appears the same in any other<br>
available frequency bands, and thus, communication seems<br>
difficult, the radio communication is stopped.<br>
(2-3) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, but the<br>
intensity of the appearing noise is sufficiently smaller<br>
than the radio wave intensity with which the own station<br>
can transmit a signal, the transmission radio wave<br>
intensity of the own station is increased.<br>
(2-4) When a noise appears in a certain long<br>
time zone as a noise from an apparatus such as a<br>
microwave oven, but, from the past experience, it can be<br>
expected that the noise situation may improve after an<br>
elapse of a time of minutes, tens of minutes or such,<br>
the above-mentioned noise evaluation is carried out<br>
again after an elapse of such a fixed time. Thus,<br>
waiting is carried out until the frequency band to use<br>
becomes unoccupied.<br>
(2-5) When the detected noise does not<br>
correspond to WiMedia and it is determined that this<br><br>
corresponds to a PC radio communication wave, and also,<br>
the PC of the own station mounts a radio communication<br>
apparatus itself generating the PC radio communication<br>
wave, an instruction is transmitted for an appropriate<br>
correction of transmission power to the radio<br>
communication apparatus of the PC of the own station.<br>
(2-6) When no noise is detected, the<br>
transmission radio wave intensity of the own station is<br>
decreased.<br>
The PC system 2 can carry out the operation<br>
of the above-mentioned item (2-1) or (2-2) with the use<br>
of the MAC part 300a. of FIG. 4 of the embodiment 1, when<br>
a noise appears constantly as a noise of a server room<br>
or such. However, it is not possible in the embodiment<br>
1 to determine an intensity level of the noise and<br>
appropriately increase the transmission radio wave<br>
intensity of the own station as in the above-mentioned<br>
item (2-3). That is, the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 of the<br>
embodiment 1 has a function of merely detecting that a<br>
noise appears. Accordingly, in the embodiment 1, even<br>
when the transmission radio wave intensity is changed<br>
according to the determination result of the determining<br>
part 363, it may not be possible to actually avoid the<br>
influence of the noise. In contrast thereto, the MAC<br>
part 300b in the embodiment 2 can use the intensity<br><br>
determining part 364 to also obtain the information of<br>
the specific intensity level of the appearing noise.<br>
Thereby, it is possible to appropriately change the<br>
transmission radio wave intensity of the own station.<br>
Further, when a noise from an apparatus such<br>
as a microwave oven or a noise from another radio<br>
communication apparatus not compliance with WiMedia<br>
appears, the PC system 2 can carry out the operations of<br>
the above-mentioned items (2-4) and (2-5) with the use<br>
of the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 in the embodiment 1. In<br>
contrast thereto, in the embodiment 2 of FIG. 5, with<br>
the use of the MAC part 300b, where the noise evaluating<br>
part 36b further has the intensity determine part 364,<br>
it is possible to decrease the transmission radio wave<br>
intensity of the own station when no noise is detected,<br>
as in the above-mentioned item (2-6). Thereby, it is<br>
possible to save power consumption of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 and also, to reduce a<br>
possibility to affect another apparatus by the radio<br>
communication of the; own station.<br>
Further, when the Channel_Busy signal is<br>
activated by the determining part 373, the control part<br>
31b may use the communication changing part 312 to<br>
provide an instruction to the PHY part 12 to cause it to<br>
switch the frequency band upon communication into<br><br>
another frequency band. In this case, the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 carries out the following<br>
operation:<br>
(2-7) With the use of the frequency band<br>
currently used for radio communication, it is notified<br>
to a radio communication apparatus on the other side of<br>
the radio communication that the frequency band is to be<br>
switched. Then, after agreement is made between the<br>
radio communication apparatus 1 and the other radio<br>
communication apparatus for the switching the frequency<br>
band, the frequency band upon communication is then<br>
switched to another frequency band.<br>
[Embodiment 3]<br>
FIG. 6 shows a third example (embodiment 3)<br>
of the configuration of the MAC part according to the<br>
best mode for carrying out the present invention.. It is<br>
noted that FIG. 6 shows only part of the MAC part and<br>
thus, only components for describing operations<br>
according the embodiment 3 of the best mode for carrying<br>
out the present invention.<br>
The MAC part 300c of FIG. 6 is different from<br>
the MAC part 300a in the first example described above<br>
in that the noise evaluating part 36c further has an<br>
intensity threshold setting part 365 for setting the<br><br>
above-mentioned threshold for activating the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal.<br>
The intensity threshold setting part 365<br>
receives, before a start of the noise measurement by<br>
means of the noise detecting part 362, a SET_CCA_THRESH<br>
signal indicating the above-mentioned threshold<br>
activating the CCA_STATUS signal for the PHY part 12 to<br>
activate the CCA_STATUS signal, from the control part<br>
31c, and outputs the value thereof to the PHY part 12 as<br>
a CCA_THRESH signal. The PHY part 12 activates the<br>
CCA_STATUS signal only when the signal level of the<br>
radio medium signal of the frequency band upon<br>
communication received by the RF part 13 exceeds the<br>
value set by the CCA_THRESH signal, and then, outputs<br>
the same to the noise evaluating part 36a of the MAC<br>
part 300c.<br>
In this case, the control part 31c can<br>
recognize a magnitude of a change in the signal level of<br>
the radio medium signal received by the RF part 13 of<br>
the radio communication apparatus 1 occurring due to an<br>
influence of a noise from another apparatus or such in<br>
the frequency band upon communication. That is, the<br>
control part 31c can determine whether or not the signal<br>
level of the radio frequency band upon communication of<br>
the radio medium signal received by the RF part 13 of<br><br>
the radio communication apparatus 1 is larger than the<br>
threshold for activating the CCA_STATUS signal set in<br>
the PHY part 12 by means of the intensity threshold<br>
setting part 365, and, when the Channel_Busy signal is<br>
activated by the determining part 363, the control part<br>
31c can notify the PC system 2, with the use of the<br>
notifying part 311, that the frequency band upon<br>
communication is affected by a noise of another<br>
apparatus or such, as well as information concerning the<br>
signal level of the radio medium signal received by the<br>
RF part 13 of the radio communication apparatus 1, when<br>
having determining that the signal level of the radio<br>
frequency band of the radio medium signal received by<br>
the RF part 13 of the radio communication apparatus 1<br>
exceeds the threshold for activating the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal.<br>
The PC system 2 thus receiving the<br>
notification from the control part 31c, carries out any<br>
one(s) of the following operations, depending<br>
circumstances of a corresponding application program:<br>
(3-1) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, but it<br>
is expected that no noise appears in another available<br>
frequency band, the currently used frequency band is<br>
switched to the other one in which it is thus expected<br><br>
that no noise appears. Then, the above-mentioned noise<br>
measurement is executed again.<br>
(3-2) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, also it<br>
is expected that a noise appears the same in any other<br>
available frequency bands, and thus, communication seems<br>
difficult, the radio communication is stopped.<br>
(3-3) When it is determined that a noise<br>
appears constantly as in a server room or such, but the<br>
intensity of the appearing noise is sufficiently smaller<br>
than a radio wave intensity with which the own station<br>
can transmits a signal, the transmission radio wave<br>
intensity of the own station is increased.<br>
(3-4) When a noise appears during a certain<br>
long time zone as a noise from an apparatus such as a<br>
microwave oven, but, from the past experience, it can be<br>
expected that the noise situation may improve after an<br>
elapse of a time of minutes, tens of minutes or such,<br>
the above-mentioned noise evaluation is carried out<br>
again after an elapse of such a fixed time. Thus,<br>
waiting is carried out until the frequency band to use<br>
becomes unoccupied.<br>
(3-5) When the detected noise does not<br>
correspond to WiMedia and it is determined that this<br>
corresponds to a PC radio communication wave, and. also,<br><br>
the PC of the own station mounts a radio communication<br>
apparatus itself generating the PC radio communication<br>
wave, an instruction is transmitted for an appropriate<br>
correction of transmission power to the radio<br>
communication apparatus of the PC of the own station.<br>
(3-6) When no noise is detected, the<br>
transmission radio wave intensity of the own station is<br>
decreased.<br>
The PC system 2 can carry out the operation<br>
of the above-mentioned item (3-1) or (3-2) with the use<br>
of the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 in the embodiment 1, when<br>
a noise appears constantly as a noise of a server room<br>
or such. However, in the embodiment 1, it is not.<br>
possible to determine an actual intensity level of the<br>
noise and to appropriately increase the transmission<br>
radio wave intensity of the own station as in the above-<br>
mentioned item (3-3) . Further, the MAC part 300a of FIG.<br>
4 in the embodiment 1 has a function of merely detecting<br>
that a noise appears. Accordingly, in the embodiment 1,<br>
even when the transmission radio wave intensity is<br>
changed according to the determination result of the<br>
determining part 363, it may not be possible to actually<br>
avoid the influence of the noise. In contrast thereto,<br>
the MAC part 300c in the embodiment 3 can use the<br>
intensity threshold setting part 365 to even recognize<br><br>
whether or not the intensity level of the noise<br>
appearing is larger than the threshold. Thereby,, it is<br>
possible to appropriately change the transmission radio<br>
wave intensity of the own station.<br>
Further, when a noise from an apparatus such<br>
as a microwave oven or a noise from another radio<br>
communication apparatus not compliance with WiMedia<br>
appears, the PC system 2 can carry out the operations of<br>
the above-mentioned items (3-4) and (3-5) with the use<br>
of the MAC part 300a of FIG. 4 in the embodiment 1.<br>
However, in the embodiment 3 of FIG. 6, with the use of<br>
the MAC part 300c, where the noise evaluating part 36b<br>
further incorporates therein the intensity threshold<br>
setting part 365, it is thus possible to decrease the<br>
transmission radio wave intensity of the own station to<br>
such a degree that the own station still may not be<br>
affected by the noise in the above-mentioned item (3-6),<br>
when no noise is detected, that is, when the noise is<br>
less than the threshed. Thereby, it is possible to save<br>
power consumption of the radio communication apparatus<br>
and also, to reduce a possibility to affect another<br>
apparatus by the radio communication of the own station.<br>
Further, when the Channel_Busy signal is<br>
activated by the determining part 373, the control part<br>
31b may use the communication changing part 312 to<br><br>
provide an instruction to the PHY part 12 to cause it to<br>
switch the frequency band upon communication into<br>
another frequency band. In this case, the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 carries out the following<br>
operation:<br>
(3-7) With the use of the frequency band<br>
currently used for the radio communication, it is<br>
notified to a radio communication apparatus on the other<br>
side of the radio communication that the frequency band<br>
is to be switched. Then, after agreement is made<br>
between the radio communication apparatus 1 and the<br>
other radio communication apparatus for the switching<br>
the frequency band, the frequency band upon<br>
communication is switched to another frequency band.<br>
The MAC part 300c in the embodiment 3 thus<br>
provides the same advantages as those of the MAC part<br>
300b of FIG. 5 using the intensity determining part 364<br>
in the embodiment 2, even with the simpler configuration.<br>
[Embodiment 4]<br>
In the MAC 300c of FIG. 6 described above as<br>
the third example (embodiment 3), the control part 31c<br>
sets the single threshold for activating the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal in the PHY part 12 by means of the intensity<br>
threshold setting part 365. However, the intensity<br><br>
threshold setting part 365 may set a plurality of<br>
thresholds having different values in the embodiment 4.<br>
A MAC part 300d of FIG. 7 is different from<br>
the MAC part 300c of FIG. 6 described above as the third<br>
example, in that a control part 31d sets two different<br>
thresholds for activating the CCA_STATUS signal in the<br>
PHY part 12 by means of the intensity threshold setting<br>
part 365. All the other components have the same<br>
functions and carry out the same operations as those of<br>
the MAC part 300c of FIG. 6.<br>
Before a start of the noise measurement by<br>
means of the noise detecting part 362, the intensity<br>
threshold setting part 365 receives, from the control<br>
part 31c, a SET_CCA_THRESH_ACT signal indicating a first<br>
threshold for the PHY part 12 to activate the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal and a SET_CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal indicating a<br>
second threshold for the PHY part 12 to deactivate the<br>
CCA_STATUS signal, and, outputs these values to the PHY<br>
part 12 as a CCA_THRESH_ACT signal and a<br>
CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal, respectively.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a diagram, as one example,, for<br>
illustrating state determination for the CCA_STATUS<br>
signal by means of the CCA_THRESH_ACT signal and the<br>
CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal.<br>
As can be clearly seen from FIG. 8, the PHY<br><br>
part 12 activates the CCA_STATUS signal when the signal<br>
level of the frequency band upon communication of the<br>
radio medium signal received by the RF part 13 of the<br>
radio communication apparatus 1 exceeds the value (level<br>
A) set by the CCA_THRESH_ACT signal. Then, after the<br>
CCA_STATUS signal is thus activated, the PHY part 12<br>
deactivates the CCA_STATUS signal when the signal level<br>
of the frequency band upon communication of the radio<br>
medium signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 lowers from the value (level B<br>
noted that, when the signal level of the radio medium<br>
signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 changes between the levels A<br>
and B after the CCA_STATUS signal is thus activated, the<br>
state of the CCA_STATUS signal is not changed. That is,<br>
the CCA_STATUS signal after being activated is kept in<br>
the active state until the signal level of the radio<br>
medium signal received by the RF part 13 of the radio<br>
communication apparatus 1 lowers from the level B.<br>
The MAC part 300d in the embodiment 4 can<br>
obtain a stable evaluation result even when the signal<br>
level of the radio medium signal received by the RF part<br>
13 of the radio communication apparatus 1 changes around<br>
the threshold, in comparison to the MAC part 300c of FIG.<br><br>
6 setting the single threshold for activating the<br>
CCA_STATUS signal in the embodiment 3. Thus, from the<br>
signal level of the radio medium signal received by the<br>
RF part 13 of the radio communication apparatus 1, it is<br>
determined whether the CCA_STATUS signal is to be<br>
activated or deactivated, by means of a level<br>
determining function thus having so-called hysteresis<br>
characteristics.<br>
Further, in the embodiment 4, instead of the<br>
CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal indicating the lower threshold<br>
for deactivating the CCA_STATUS signal, a<br>
CCA_THRESH_DELTA signal indicating a change amount from<br>
the threshold set by the CCA_THRESH_ACT signal may be<br>
used. The CCA_THRESH_DELTA signal and the<br>
CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal have the following relationship:<br>
(CCA_THRESH_DEACT)<br>
= (CCA_THRESH_ACT) - (CCA_THRESH_DELTA)<br>
There, (CCA_THRESH_DEACT), (CCA_THRESH_ACT)<br>
and (CCA_THRESH_DELTA) represent the values indicated by<br>
the CCA_THRESH_DEACT signal, the CCA_THRESH_ACT signal<br>
and the CCA_THRESH_DELTA signal, respectively.<br>
While the invention herein disclosed has been<br>
described by means of specific embodiments and<br><br>
applications thereof, numerous modifications and<br>
variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the<br>
art without departing from the scope of the invention<br>
set forth in the claims.<br>
The present application is based on Japanese<br>

filed on March 16, 2006 and November 2, 2006,<br>
