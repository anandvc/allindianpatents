This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application no. 60/853,891, filed October 23, 2006, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to methods of synthesizing 5-alkyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin- 4-ols.<br><br>
2. BACKGROUND Pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines have attracted much interest because of their biological importance. See, e.g., Choi, H.-S., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16:2689-2692 (2006); Choi, H.-S., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16:2173-2176 (2006); Smalley, T. L., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16:2091-2094 (2006); Gangjee, A., et al, J. Med. Chem. 49:1055- 1065 (2006); Seela, F. and Peng, X., J. Org. Chem. 71 :81-90 (2006); Foloppe, N., et al., J. Med. Chem. 48:4332-4345 (2005); Kempson, J., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 15:1829- 1833 (2005); Traxler, Peter, et al., Med. Res. Rev. 21 :499-512 (2001). Syntheses of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines typically require the preparation of 5-alkyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3- d]pyrimidin-4-ol intermediates. See, e.g., U.S. patent application no. 11/354,636, filed February 15, 2006. But despite their importance, few methods are known for preparing 5- alkyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ols with wide applicability. See e.g., Amarnath and Madhav, Synthesis, 837 (1974).<br><br>
Typical synthetic methods include a desulfurization step, as illustrated in Scheme 1 :<br><br>
Raney-Nickel<br><br><br>
Scheme 1 <br><br>
See, e.g., West, J. Org. Chem. 26:4959 (1961); Aono et al., EP 0733633-B1. Desulfurization is typically carried out using Raney Nickel in large excess, which can result in large amounts of heavy metal waste. In addition, when R is methyl, the process requires long heating times. See, e.g., U.S. patent application no. 11/354,636, filed February 15, 2006. When R is hydrogen, the desulfurization is typically faster, but it requires multiple steps and provides lower yields.<br><br>
5-Alkyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ols can also be prepared from the cyanopyrrole 3, as illustrated below in Scheme 2:<br><br><br>
See e.g., Wamhoff and Wehling, Synthesis 51 (1976). Unfortunately, this reaction uses harsh conditions and provides poor yields. See also, Girgis et al., Synthesis 101 (1985). Consequently, new methods of preparing 5-alkyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ols are needed.<br><br>
3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention is directed, in part, to novel methods of preparing 5-alkyl-7H- pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ols and salts and solvates thereof.<br><br>

Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns. For example, the phrase "optionally substituted alky, aryl, or heteroaryl" has the same meaning as "optionally substituted alky, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl."<br><br>
It should be noted that a chemical moiety that forms part of a larger compound may be described herein using a name commonly accorded it when it exists as a single molecule or a name commonly accorded its radical. For example, the terms "pyridine" and "pyridyl" are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases "XOH, wherein X is pyridyl" and "XOH, wherein X is pyridine" are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol. It should also be noted that if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. In addition, chemical bonds depicted with one solid line parallel to one dashed line encompass both single and double (e.g., aromatic) bonds, if valences permit.<br><br>
4.2. Methods<br><br>
This invention encompasses methods of preparing compounds of formula I: <br><br><br>
I and salt and solvates thereof, wherein Ri is hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, heterocycle, arylalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the compound of formula I is prepared by contacting a compound of formula II:<br><br><br>
with a formic acid ester of formula HCOOR5 under conditions sufficient to provide the compound of formula I, wherein R5 is optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl.<br><br>
Conditions sufficient to provide the compound of formula I include a base catalyst in a solvent. Suitable bases include those with conjugate acids possessing pKas greater than 12, and mixtures thereof. Examples of bases include metal hydroxides (e.g., lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide), metal alkoxides (e.g., lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide), and metal amides (e.g., lithium hexamethyldisilazide). Suitable solvents include alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol), amides (e.g., dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane), and nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile).<br><br>
Any suitable amount of solvent may be used. In one embodiment, the amount is from about 1 to about 50, about 5 to about 30, or about 10 to about 25 times the weight amounts of the starting compound. Similarly, the any suitable amount of base may be used. In one embodiment, the amount is from about 1 to about 10, about 1 to about 5, or about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents of the starting compound.<br><br>
The compound of formula II may be dissolved, dispersed, suspended or otherwise suitably distributed in the solvent. In a particular method, the formic acid ester is added to the solution, followed by the addition of the base. Addition of the base can occur at any suitable temperature, including temperatures from about 00C to about 8O0C, about 200C to about 8O0C, and about 400C to about 6O0C, and can occur over any suitable duration, <br><br>
including periods of from about 0.25 to about 5 hours, about 0.25 to about 3 hours, and about 0.25 to about 2 hours. In certain methods, the mixture is stirred or otherwise mixed to facilitate the reaction. In certain methods, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 200C to about 1000C, about 400C to about 800C, or about 500C to about 700C, and for a time of from about 0.5 to about 20 hours, about 1 to about 10 hours, or about 2 to about 8 hours. Completion of the reaction can be determined by any suitable analytical method.<br><br>
In a particular method, esters remaining at the completion of the reaction are hydro lyzed, the organic solvent(s) is/are removed, and the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to precipitate the product. In a certain method, the pH is from about 2 to about 10, from about 4 to about 10, or from about 4 to about 8. In preferred methods, the product of formula I is isolated with good yield (e.g., greater than about 30 or 50 percent) and high purity (e.g., greater than about 90 or 98 percent as determined by HPLC).<br><br>
The compound of formula II may be prepared by contacting a compound of formula III:<br><br>
'" with cyanoacetamide under conditions sufficient to provide the compound of formula II, wherein R2 and R3 are each independently hydrogen or R4CO-, or are taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached to provide a heterocycle (e.g., phthalimido, succinimido); and R4 is optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkoxy, or aryloxy. Compounds of formula III are commercially available, or can be prepared by methods known in the art.<br><br>
Conditions sufficient to provide the compound of formula II include a base catalyst in a solvent. Suitable bases include those with conjugate acids possessing pKas greater than 12, and mixtures thereof. Examples of bases include metal hydroxides (e.g., lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide), metal alkoxides (e.g., lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide), and metal amides (e.g., lithium hexamethyldisilazide). Suitable solvents include alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol), amides (e.g., dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane), and nitriles (e.g., acetonitrile). <br><br>
Any suitable amount of solvent may be used. In one embodiment, the amount is from about 1 to about 50, about 5 to about 30, or about 10 to about 25 times the weight amounts of the starting compound. Similarly, the any suitable amount of base may be used. In one embodiment, the amount is from about 1 to about 10, about 1 to about 5, or about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents of the starting compound.<br><br>
Any suitable amount of cyanoacetamide may be used. In one embodiment, the amount is from about 1 to about 5, from about 1 to about 3, or from about 1 to about 2 molar equivalents of the starting compound. The cyanoacetamide may be dissolved, dispersed, suspended or otherwise suitably distributed in the solvent. Preferably, the base is then added to the mixture, which is maintained at a suitable temperature (e.g., from about -100C to about 600C, about -100C to about 400C, or about 100C to about 300C) for an amount of time sufficient for the reaction to occur (e.g., from about 0 to about 5 hours, about 0.25 to about 5 hours, or about 0.25 to about 1 hours).<br><br>
The compound of formula III may be dissolved, dispersed, suspended or otherwise suitably distributed in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment, it is added over a time of from about 0 to about 5 hours, about 0.25 to about 5 hours, or about 0.25 to about 2 hour. The mixture may be stirred or otherwise suitably mixed to facilitate the reaction. The reaction itself may be conducted at any suitable temperature (e.g., from about 00C to about 1000C, about 200C to about 800C, or about 400C to about 600C) or an amount of time sufficient for it to occur (e.g., from about 0.5 to about 20 hours, about 0.5 to about 10 hours, or about 1 to about 5 hours).<br><br>
A specific method of the invention is represented below:<br><br><br>
Scheme 5 In this method, the use of a mononitrile (cyanoacetamide), instead of a symmetrical dinitrile (e.g., malonitrile), provides compounds of formula II in good yield. In one embodiment, the compound of formula II is isolated. In another, it is not. <br><br>
5. EXAMPLES<br><br>
Aspects of this invention can be understood from the following examples, which do not limit its scope.<br><br>
Reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. All solvents used were of HPLC grade. NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker ARX 300, Bruker DPX 400 or Varian Mercury 400. HPLC analysis was performed on a Shimadzu instrument with a PDA detector. HPLC/MS analysis was carried out on a Waters ZQ or Shimadzu instrument.<br><br>
5.1. Example 1<br><br><br>
To a solution of cyanoacetamide (14.0 g, 1.08 eq) in ethanol (175 ml) was added 21% sodium ethoxide solution in ethanol (198.8 g, 3.99 eq) at room temperature. To the resulting mixture was added acetamidoacetone (17.7 g, 154 mmol, prepared according to Wiley and Borum, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 70:2005 (1948)). The resulting mixture was then heated at 500C for 3.25 h. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture indicated that the pyrrole compound was formed in about 67% of the HPLC area. An analytical sample of the pyrrole compound was isolated by aqueous work-up followed by purification with column chromatography.
