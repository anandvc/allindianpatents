(b)	UKRAINE (C) ul. Gorobtsa, 2,Dnieprodzerzhynsk, 51909,UKRAINE                                                           <br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The invention relates to the chemical to the chemical industry, namely to the method for production of hydroxylamine sulfate (HAS) used for caprolactam production.<br>
Production of concentrated nitric monoxide, used in HAS synthesis, by catalytic oxidizing of ammonia is inevitably accompanied with formation of diluted nitric acid (see the patent of USA 3110563 published on 12.11.1963) which recuperation brings about significant capital and operating costs. There are different method of these wastes recuperation used in HAS production. It is known the method for HAS production included preparation of the reaction mixture of ammonia, oxygen and steam, catalytic oxidizing of ammonia, stabilization of the NOx-gas composition by hydrogenation on the silver-manganic catalyst, its two-stage condensation be steam concentration, mixing of the concentrated NOx-gas with hydrogen, mixture of sulfuric acid, water, condensate from the first stage of NOx-gas concentration, catalysate after hydrogenation of the second stage of NOx-gas concentration, catalytic hydrogenation of this condensate in presence of platinum catalyst and HAS synthesis (see application EPO 945401, IPC6 C01B21/14, published in 1999).<br>
In this manner full recuperation of diluted nitric acid wastes is reached. However, this method is characterized with difficulty in control and significant capital and operating costs specified with need of the stages for NOx-gas stabilization, compression and catalytic hydrogenation of nitric acid condensate. Also heat of NOx-gas lost irrevocably.<br>
The most close on technical essence and reached effect is the method for HAS production including preparation of the reaction mixture of ammonia, oxygen and steam, catalytic oxidizing of ammonia, stabilization of the produced NOx-gas by hydrogenation on the  silver-manganic<br>
2-<br><br>
catalyst, its two-stage concentration by steam condensation [see the patent RF 2045471, IPC6 C01B21/14, published in 10/10/1995, bulletin 28-prior knowledge]. 70% of condensate, containing nitric acid with mass share up to 0,3% is separated on the first stage of condensation, nitric acid with mass share up to 5-6% is formed on the second stage. Condensate from the first stage is sent for diluting of sulfuric acid, condensate from the second stage after evaporating up to 40-45% is heated up to 300 °C and mixed with the main stream of NOx-gas, coming for stabilization, and steam is sent for preparation of mixture: ammonia, oxygen, steam. As in above mentioned case, recuperation of diluted nitric acid wastes brings about significant complication of the process, its reliability and essential capital costs.<br>
The goal of the present invention is in improvement of the method of HAS production by the process changing - eliminating of the stages of catalytic hydrogenation of nitric acid condensate, NOx-gas stabilization and compressing, - and the process parameters so that the capital and operational costs become lower, control and adjustment become more simple.<br>
The put problem is solved in that in the method of HAS production including preparation of the reaction mixture of ammonia, oxygen and steam, catalytic oxidizing of ammonium, NOx-gas concentration at the expense of steam condensation, mixing of the concentrated NOx-gas with hydrogen, sulfuric acid mixture, water, condensate from NOx-gas concentration and YAS synthesis, according the invention the catalytic oxidizing of ammonia is executed under the pressure more than 0,3 MPa, heat of NOx-gas is used for concentration of nitric acid condensate and HAS solution, in so doing nitric acid condensate is concentrated up to the mass share of nitric acid not less than 40%, and YAS solution is concentrated up to the mass share of 40% at the expense of the heat of the<br>
3<br><br>
distillate vapor condensation, formed when nitric acid condensate concentrated. The condensate with the mass share of nitric acid about 40% is got out as a final product and can be used in nitric fertilizes production.<br>
The Fig. 1 shows the drawing illustrating the applying method.<br>
The method is realized in following way.<br>
For production of 1 ton of hydroxylamine in hour the reaction mixture consisting of 817,5 kg/hour of ammonia, 2052,6 kg/hour of oxygen and 4021 kg/hour of steam is prepared in mixer 1 and sent to the Reactor 2, where on the platinum gauzes the steam and oxygen conversion of ammonia under the pressure more than 0,3 MPa, for example 0,3-0,35 MPa, is realized. The heat of ammonia oxidation reaction is used for steam production, cooling NOx-gas in the Waste heat boiler of the Reactor 2. The produced NOx-gas comes to the Heater 3 of the tower for nitric acid condensate distillation, where the steam is condensed with separation of nitric acid condensate (NAC) and NOx-gas concentrates. The heat of steam condensation is used for concentration of nitric acid condensate from the mass share of 7-8.5% to the mass share of 40%. The gaseous distillate forming there and containing nitric acid with the mass share up to 0,25% comes to the Heat Exchanger 7, where HAS solution with the mass share about 24% is sent as a cooling agent. HAS solution, heated at the expense of condensation the distillate's steam comes to the Separator 8, where water is evaporated from solution under reduced pressure and at the temperature 60-85 °C. The concentrated solution contains HAS with the mass share about 40%. NOx-gas after Heater 3 of the Distillation Tower 6 comes to the Heat Exchanger 4, where condensation of the residual steam with forming of nitric acid condensate with the mass share of 7-8.5% and cooling of the concentrated NOx-gas down to 40 °C take place; then NOx-gas is purified from nitric oxide (IV) in the Scrubber 5 and sent to the Stage<br>
4 <br>
of HAS synthesis 11 in amount of 1092 kg/hour. The concentrated distillate with the mass share of nitric acid 0,25% and also a part of the second vapor condensate (SV) after the Separator 8 and Condenser of the second vapor 9 sent for diluting of the concentrated sulfuric acid to the Stage 10. The residual from the Distillation Tower 6 with the mass share of nitric acid about 40% in amount of 1138 kg/hour (455 kg/hour of nitric oxide monohydrate) is got out as a final product and can be used in nitric fertilizes production. The tail gases (TG) from the reactors of HAS synthesis is sent to the Recuperation Unit 12 for burning.<br>
In the Table 1 for comparison is shown the data, illustrating of the HAS synthesis plant operation under the applying method and prior knowledge.<br>
It can be seen from the Table, that the specific consumption of raw material for the product fabrication is higher than in prior knowledge. But herewith in addition the nitric acid with the mass share of 40%, which can be used for preparing of the mineral fertilizers and desired product - HAS with the mass share of 40% instead of 24,6% are produced without additional power consumption.<br>
