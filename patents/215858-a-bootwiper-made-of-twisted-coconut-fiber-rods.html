				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention provides a bootwper made of twisted coconut fiber rods.<br>
The invention relates to a coconut fibre Bootwiper made with twisted in brush coconut fibre rods fixed to a galvanized steel wire frame through a plastic/Rubber separator grids. Rubber strips are used at the bottom of this Bootwiper as an anti-skid device.<br>
We are the holders of patent right for twisted in brush fibre rod mat and apperatus to make the same as per Patent~NoTl 1028 dated 11/07/96" and boot/shoe wiper Patent No 10786 dated 07.04.95.<br>
The twisted in brush coconut fibre rods may be rotatably fixed on to the galvanized steel wire frame through the holes of the plastic / rubber separator grids on certain designs.<br>
The arrangement of this twisted in brush fibre rods of the base frame may be to give a desired pattern bur. generally the twisted in fibre rods are in a. perpendicular direction to the upstanding 3 Bootwiper rods that are fitted to the upper face of the frame with the twisted in brush fibre rods.<br>
Conventional bootwipers are manufactured with fibre &amp; metal for uss :it the entrances, exits, doorways and openings of all types of buildings and the designs and techniques used so far serve the purpose only partly, creating certain, disadvantages as listed below.<br>
Dirt, mud &amp; other objects such as snow are not completely removed from the boot or the shoes as the wiped dirt accumulates on the brush fibres, since these are placed and fixed on a flat horizontal plain generally parallel to the floor on which the bootwiper is placed. Therefore such inventions of Doormats with Bootwipers and other profiles are not efficient and require periodical cleaning by lifting, shaking or vibrating. These vigorous actions are not only tedious but reduce the lifetime of the mat drastically.<br>
The conventional type of bootwipers made out of coconut fibre and the like and having rubber or plastic and metal components for the base have tight configuration on a flat surface thereby preventing drying by rapid evaporation and any moisture acquired with dirt during rains or snow.<br><br>
Bootscrpaers with steel wires incorporating fibres have the distinct disadvantage of getting corroded due to frequent presence of moisture. In addition to the above mentioned disadvantages, since the brush fibres are stationery and fixed to a steel wire frame without allowing any movement or without any gaps m between them.<br>
The conventional type of Bootwiper made out of twisted in fibre rods with a helical wire grid also had limitation of designs and patterns, which were restricted.<br>
The bootwiper with metal/steel wires could cause damage and injury.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective to the alleged invention is aimed at overcoming most of the disadvantages of the prior art Bootwipers and floor mats and also using as far as possible ecologically friendly recyclable material such as natural fibres, rubber and plastics.<br>
The invention also permits introduction of various additional cosmetic effects, designs and patterns of the Bootwiper by using different colours types available in materials. The invention provides rotary movement of circular brush rods as an option made by twisted coconut brush fibre rods. The rotation of the said brush fibre rods enhances the life of the mat and the efficiency.<br>
Another objective of alleged invention is to overcome the high cost of production of conventional Bootwiper made of expensive material such as metal / steel.<br>
The base frame may be so arranged with twisted in fibre rods to obtain pre-determined designs by using unique plastic/rubber grid separators/ spacer tubing grid. By changing the designs, length, pattern &amp; colours the, base design may be of round, square, zigzag, Octagonal or any other desired shape or design as shown in the drawings.<br>
The disadvantage of causing injury with material such as steel/metal is also overcome by using twisted in fibre rods, plastics, &amp; rubber material.<br><br>
This unique design bootwiper, wipes sides of the shoe/boot as well as the bottom side simultaneously and brushing process being done by the twisted in fibre rods set according to a prc-dctcrmincd pattern OD the base frame.<br>
This circular twisted in fibre rods enables the entire circular surface to be used and the dirt can fall under the mat while providing air circulation for rapid evaporation and the frequently present moisture. The bootwipers are made in such a way that the base mat has circular twisted in fibre rods placed perpendicular to the 3 wiper rods which are placed perpendicular on the top surface of the base mat made with twisted in circular fibre rods and the Gl wire frame with plastic / rubber separators.<br>
The invention provides a bootwiper which is made out of metal wire frame using a Rubber / plastic grid and brush fibre rods which are twisted in with coconut fibre and the separators may be made of Polypropylene, fibre, PVC or other materials.<br>
The ecologically friendly and non-corrosive materials are preferred in making such bootwipers. Cleaning action is enhanced by circular' coconut fibre rods as well as the fibre/plastic/rubber separators having ridges or studs and plastic tubes covering the metal grid frame and the upstanding ridges made out of twisted in coconut fibre rods.<br>
Preferably the ridges and studs on the thin rubber/ plastic separators on both top and bottom sides of the thin walls are designed symmetrically about the axis along the center of the holes and these separators may be injection moulded to remove and loosen the hardened earth or SDOW etc,, and make them fall through spaces provided between the perpendicular placed and rotatably (fixed) inserted twisted in fibre rods. The said ridges and studs enhances the strength of the separators thereby increasing the strength of the finished bootwiper. The preferred embodiment of the invention essentially consist of the following parts.<br>
The preferred embodiment given below is only an example and does not limit the scope of the claims given at the end of this complete specification.<br><br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The frame is made out of galvanized wire and rubber/plastic separators having ridges or studs and holes to accommodate twisted in fibre rods.<br>
Please refer to the Fig. 2 where the plastic/rubber separators are inserted into the square GI wire frames. In Fig.3 and Fig. 8 it is clearly seen how the separators and spacer tubing made out of plastic/rubber are designed spaced inside the metal frame and a grid is made. When the separators are inserted as shown in Fig 3, they are at equal intervals and are so placed by placing plastic / rubber tubing at the opposite sides of the frame, before folding the GI wire on the final side to the process as given in Fig.2 with twisted in brush fibre rods are used through the holes. Marked A, B, C in Figure 1 and these rods are perpendicular to the plastic / rubber separators.<br>
The user can stand on the base platform section to wipe the sole and the three upstanding transverse/ perpendicular 3 twisted in fibre rods x,y &amp; z shown in figure 4 wipes the side portions of the shoe/boot.<br>
Now what we have obtained is a flat mat consisting of a GT wire frame with twisted in'fibre rods and these fibre rods are held in place with plastic/rubber separators. What we have obtained is a flat mat consisting of a GI wire frame with twisted in fibre rods having an upper &amp; lower face and these fibre rods are held in place with plastic/rubber separators.<br>
Now refer to Fig 4&amp;5. Three upstanding twisted in fibre rods x,y &amp; z are placed at the 2 extreme edges (x &amp; y) perpendicular to the twisted in fibre rods of the base frame and the third one z is placed right at the center.<br>
Figure 4 &amp; 5 clearly indicates how these three twisted in fibre rods x,y &amp; z which are placed at perpendicular direction to the base frame as boorwipers wipe the sides of the boot, when a person stands on the bootwiper.<br><br>
Several designs could be made by using this same method or the process. If you see Fig 9 the twisted in fibre rods are bent at the extreme ends to give a novel design similarly with Fig 10,11 &amp; 12. On the reverse side or the reverse face of thebootwiper where the 3 upstanding twisted in fibre rods are placed 2 rubber strips are placed at the extreme ends on the opposite face to act as anti skid devices. In short 2 rubber strips are placed at both sides of the Bootwiper on the bottom at the extreme ends to stop skidding of the bootwiper. This is clearly shown in Fig 12.<br>
Plastic / rubber separators shown in Fig 1 are relatively thin and its made by injection moulding process or compression moulding process and could be made with different size diameter holes as required. The components of the Bootwiper are unique and novel and therefore are made systematically with specific purpose skills and essentially with custom designed machines and the apparatus with specially trained skilled labour. Due to the nature of natural ecologically friendly and non rusting materials used the said bootwiper could be produced in a variety of colours and patterns to give a matching effect the place of its use and suit any individual users taste.<br>
The above description of the preferred embodiment does not in anyway limit the scope of this invention and these embodiments given in Figures 8 -12 are only examples and descriptions of the many of the embodiments of the invention that are covered by the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
