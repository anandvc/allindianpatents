The present invention concerns a novel process for the synthesis of zeolites and mesoporous solids based on oxides of tetravalent elements. More precisely, the invention concerns a process for the synthesis of zeolites and mesoporous solids based on silicon and/or aluminium, of silicon and aluminium, in the form of TO’ tetrahedra, constituting the three-dimensional framework of these solids.<br>
Zeolites are crystallized tectosilicates. They have a three dimensional structure constructed from an assembly of TO4 tetrahedra with their vertices in common, two different tetrahedra having only one oxygen in common. In aluminosilicate type zeolites, which are the most common, T represents tetravalent silicon as well as trivalent aluminium. The cavities and channels in the aluminosilicate framework., which are of molecular dimensions, attract cations which compensate the charge deficit associated with the presence of trivalent aluminium in the tetrahedra.<br>
The chemical composition of zeolites containing slements Al and Si in their framework can be represented 3y the following approximate formula:<br>
M2/nO, AI2O3, xSi02 ;here:<br>
M represents a cation with valency n, such as an<br>
alkali or alkaline-earth, or an organic cation;<br><br>
X can vary, as a function of the structure of the<br>
zeolite, between two and infinity; if x is infinity,<br>
the zeolite is a microporous silica.<br>
Each type of zeolite has a distinct porous structure. The variation between the dimensions and shapes of the pores of one type of zeolite compared with another generates different adsorbent and catalytic properties. Only molecules with certain dimensions and shapes can enter into the pores of a particular type of zeolite. The chemical composition, in particular the nature of the exchangeable compensating cations, is also an important factor in adsorption selectivity, and especially in the catalytic properties of these zeolites.<br>
Because of their geometrical selectivity and cation exchange properties, zeolites are used in industry on a large scale both for adsorption (drying gases, separation of aromatic compounds, etc..) and in catalysis (catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, isomerisation etc...). There is currently no industrial application for ordered mesoporous solids (International patent application WO 91/11390 and Nature vol. 368, p 317, 24 March 1994). A number of patents illustrate the industrial applications of mesoporous solids, for example United States patents US-A-5 105 051 and US-A-5 134 241.<br>
While numerous aluminosilicate type zeolites exist in nature, over the last few years research on substances with novel properties has led to the synthesis of a large<br><br>
variety of aluininosilicates with a zeolitic structure. Examples of a variety of structures which have been successfully synthesized are: Y zeolite (US-A-3 130 007), ZSM-5 or MFI zeolite (US-A-3 702 886), ZSM-12 zeolite (US-A-3 832 449), and ZSM-22 (US-A-4 481 177). More recently, ordered mesoporous solids have been synthesized, using organic structuring agents which are surfactants.<br>
Zeolites are generally synthesized from a silica or silica and alumina gel, transformation of the gel to zeolite crystals being effected hydrothermally. The generally agreed synthesis mechanism is a dissolution-recrystallisation mechanism. Crystal formation takes place in the liquid phase following condensation reactions between some of the silicate and aluminosilicate species present. The solid phase of the gel acts as a reservoir for reactants due to continuous dissolution. These reactions are possible because of the presence of mobilising agents, generally 0H~, and also F~ (synthesis in a basic medium or in a neutral or acidic medium respectively), which allow the transfer of polycondensable species by the solution. The reaction medium also contains "structuring" agents which are incorporated into the microporous space in the framework during crystallisation, thus controlling the construction of the framework and contributing, via the reactions<br><br>
which occur, to the stability of the structure. These structuring agents may be inorganic or organic in nature. Since zeolites are metastable compounds, the nature of the zeolite formed from a gel depends not only on conventional thermodynamic parameters (overall composition of the gel, temperature, pressure) but also on "kinetic" factors linked to the "reactivity" of the gel. This gel reactivity, which partially determines the degree of "supersaturation" achieved in the liquid phase, is a function of the method used to prepare the gel ("history" of the gel) or the nature of the starting materials used (the degree of division, for example).<br>
This method of synthesis from a gel has a number of problems, among them:<br>
the difficulty of producing large quantities of gels which are homogeneous in texture and composition, with solubility properties which are spatially and temporally stable;<br>
generally non congruent (imperfect) dissolution of the gel, i.e., non homogeneous temporally and spatially;<br>
chemical engineering problems associated with use and which involve difficulties with stirring the gel, which is sometimes very viscous and of complex control of heat transfers in the reaction system as a whole;<br><br>
a possible reduction in gel reactivity due to ageing<br>
during the heating period;<br>
supersaturation of the solution which is brought<br>
about by the composition and texture of the gel<br>
which cannot thus be genuinely controlled; -  as  a  consequence  of  the  preceding  point,  the<br>
impossibility  of  controlling  the  nucleation  and<br>
growth conditions of the zeolite crystals.<br>
A further synthesis method consists of using homogeneous aqueous reaction mixtures in place of gels.<br>
Several types of zeolite have been prepared by heating aqueous solutions of basic metastable aluminosilicates.<br>
FAU type zeolites, for' example, have been prepared using this method by S. Neda, N. Kageyama, M. Koizumi, Proc. 6th Int. Zeol. Conf., (Reno, USA, 1983) and A. Bisio and D. H. Olson, Eds., Butterworths, UK, 1984. Similarly, LTA type zeolite has been prepared using this method, by P. Wengin, S. Neda, M. Koizumi, Proc. 7th Int. Zeol. Conf. (Tokyo, Japan, 1986) and Y. Murakami, A. Jijima, J.W. Ward, Eds., Kodanska-Elsevier, Tokyo-Amsterdam, 1986.<br>
MFI type zeolites based on silicon and element(s) T', selected from the group formed by Ti, Ge, Zr and Sn, lave been prepared from a homogeneous reaction mixture [containing a silicon source in the form of a fluorinated complex, one or more sources of tetravalent elements T'<br><br>
in the form of fluorinated complexes, a chemical modifying agent which provides H0~ ions by hydrothermal decomposition under the reaction conditions, and a structuring agent which orientates and stabilizes the formation of the MFI type zeolite. Heating the reaction mixture comprising the chemical modifying agent at a temperature of at least 120°C leads to the formation of a zeolite precipitate which is then separated out. This method is described in French patent applications FR-A-2 666 321, FR-A-2 674 516 and FR-A-2 674 517.<br>
During syntheses in closed systems from the solutions mentioned above, it is clear that the supersaturation and thus the nucleation and growth conditions again cannot be controlled.<br>
The aim of the present invention is thus to provide a novel process for the synthesis of zeolites based on 2lement(s) T, i.e., based on silicon or based on silicon and aluminium, and mesoporous solids based on element(s) ?, i.e., based on silicon and/or aluminium, which can overcome the problems described above.<br>
This process, in contrast to prior known processes, .s such that the starting mixtures are constituted by Lomogeneous aqueous solutions, the zeolite or mesoporous ;old being synthesized in a semi-open system by :controlled injection of a reactant.<br>
More particularly, the present invention concerns a races for the synthesis of zeolites based on silicon or<br><br>
based on silicon and aluminium, the Si/Al molar ratio being in the range 1 to infinity (including these limits), and mesoporous solids based on silicon and/or aluminium, i.e., based on silicon or based on aluminium or based on silicon and aluminium, comprising the following sequence of steps: i)   synthesizing a homogeneous reaction medium as a<br>
source of element(s) T (silicon and/or aluminium)<br>
containing:<br>
a)	at least one source of element(s) T, T being selected from the group formed by silicon and aluminium, selected from the group formed by aqueous basic solutions and alcoholic solutions of an alkyl tetraorthosilicate and an trialkoxyaluminium;<br>
b)	optionally, at least one organic and/or inorganic structuring agent;<br>
c)	optionally, seeds of the desired crystalline<br>
phase;<br>
ii) heating the reaction medium to a temperature in the range 20°C to 220°C, preferably in the range 20"C to 180°C, for a period in the range several minutes to several days, preferably in the range 10 minutes to 2 4 hours;<br>
iii) injecting at least one chemical agent at a controlled rate to generate polycondensable species in said medium as they are used up,  to ensure<br><br>
nucleation and growth of the crystals of zeolites or mesoporous solids.<br>
Thus when zeolites based on eleinent(s) T are synthesized, T is silicon or silicon and aluminium. When the process is used to synthesize mesoporous solids based on element(s) T, T is silicon or aluminium, or silicon and aluminium.<br>
The synthesis process of the invention may optionally comprise a supplemental calcining step for the crystals obtained at step (iii), at a temperature of more than 400"c, to eliminate the structuring agent from the channels of the prepared structures.<br>
The source of element(s) T (silicon or aluminium) is:<br>
either a stable silica-based aqueous solution, and optionally a stable alumina-based aqueous solution, these two solutions being basic when mixed together. These aqueous solutions are well known to the skilled person and may be, by way of non limiting example, aqueous solutions of sodium silicates and sodium aluminate.<br>
or an alcoholic solution of Si(0R)4, silicon tetraorthosilicate, optionally with Al(0R)3, a trialkoxyaluminium; these solutions are well known to the skilled person.<br>
The source of element(s) T is in an entirely soluble form  in  the  reaction  medium  in  order  to  ensure<br><br>
homogeneity of the medium, which is then termed a homogeneous solution.<br>
The structuring agent is selected from those known to the skilled person for syntheses of zeolites and mesoporous solids. It can be used alone or mixed with at least one other structuring agent. In the case of an inorganic structuring agent, for example, sodium can be used, also the fluoride ion F~.<br>
The polycondensable species are obtained from said homogeneous reaction medium by controlled injection of at least one chemical agent. The nature of the chemical agent depends on the nature of the source of element(s) T.<br>
Thus: in the case where the source of element(s) T is a basic aqueous solution of silica or silica-alumina, the polycondensable species are produced by controlled injection of at least one chemical agent selected from the group formed by acids, alcohols, and ethers, for example methanol (MeOH) or ethanol (EtOH), aqueous aluminate solutions and aqueous structuring agent solutions in the case, for example, where the structuring agent is not initially present in the reaction medium.<br>
When the chemical agent is an acid, a pure acid or an aqueous acid solution is used. Examples are acetic acid, CH3CO2H, ammonium chloride NH4CI, or a gas such as CO2. In this case, controlled injection of acid leads to a reduction in the pH of the solution and the formation<br><br>
of  polycondensable  species  in  accordance  with  the following reaction:<br>
where T = Si, Al.<br>
The control of the acid injection rate, and thus the rate of formation of the polycondensable species (V]_), allows the direct formation of crystals of zeolites or mesoporous solids from the solution without the intermediate formation of a gel. Controlling the supersaturation of polycondensable species allows the crystallisation rate to be controlled.<br>
Thus: when the source of elements T is an alcoholic solution of Si(OR)4 and/or Al(0R)3, the polycondensable species are produced by controlled injection of at least one chemical agent selected from the group formed by water, aqueous acidic or basic solutions, compounds which decompose at the synthesis temperature to form water and aqueous solutions of the structuring agent in the case where, for example, the structuring agent is not initially present in the reaction medium.<br>
In all cases, synthesis of the zeolite or mesoporous solid can be carried out with stirring (stirred mode) or in a static mode, stirring being particularly easy since a homogeneous reaction medium is present.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the synthesis of zeolites based on silicon or based on silicon and aluminium, the Si/Al molar ratio being in the range 1 to infinity and mesoporous solids based on silicon or based on aluminium, or based on silicon and aluminium, comprising: i) synthesizing a reaction medium as a source of at least one element(s) T, T being silicon or aluminium, said medium being an aqueous solution containing at least one source of at least one element(s) T which source is an aqueous basic solution or an alcoholic solution of an alkyl tetraorthosilicate and a trialkoxyaluminate; ii) heating the reaction medium to a temperature in the range of 20’ C to 220° C; iii) injecting at least one chemical agent, such as hereindescribed, at a rate effective to generate polycondensable species in said medium; iv) filtering the solution obtained from step (iii); and<br>
v) calcining the crystals of zeolites and mesoporous solids obtained after filtration, at a temperature of more than 400°C.<br><br>
The following examples illustrate the invention without in any way limiting its scope.<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
1.2 grams of Aerosil 130 silica was dissolved in an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.4 grams of sodium hydroxide, 7.2 grams of water). 28.8 grams of hexadecyl-trimethylammoniuiu chloride, CTMACl, (25% in water, Fluka) was added to this solution. The molar composition of the solution was:<br>
1 Si02; 0.5 NaOH; 1.125 CTMACl; 80 H2O;<br>
At a temperature of 20°C, 15 cm-’ of a molar ammonium chloride solution was injected over three minutes (flow rate 5 pj./inin) .<br><br>
The product was recovered by filtration then washed with distilled water and dried at 80"C for 12 hours.<br>
The initial pH and the final pH were respectively about 11.5 and 9.8. The X ray diffraction diagram was characteristic of a mesoporous MCM-41 type product; one intense diffraction peak corresponding to a d(hkl) of about 37 A accompanied by several far less intense peaks at 21.4, 18.5 and 14 A.  The mass obtained was 1.3 grams.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A tetrapropylammonium silicate solution was prepared by dissolving 3 grams of Aerosil silica in 50 cm-’of a molar aqueous solution of Pr4N"'"0H'" (20% by weight of Pr’NOH, Fluka). This solution, with a molar composition of 1 Si02; 1 Pr’NOH; 45 H2O, was transferred to an autoclave lined with Teflon (125 cm-’ capacity) then heated to 170°C. Synthesis was carried out over 24 hours by controlled and continuous injection of carbon dioxide (hourly flow rate 0.14 grams/hour) at 170°C and in stirred mode (magnetic bar). After rapid cooling (the autoclave was plunged into cold water at 15°C), the solid was filtered, washed with distilled water then dried at 80°C for 24 hours.<br>

EXAMPLE 7<br>
A synthesis analogous to that of Example 6 was carried out, prolonging the injection period to 48 hours (the other operating conditions remained the same). This produced a MFI type zeolite (X ray diffraction diagram analogous to that of Table 1) with a mass of about 2.8 grams.
