PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS WITH COCOA BUTTER AND DIHYDROXYPROPYL AMMONIUM SALTS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITION WITH COCOA BUTTER AND DIHYDROXYPROPYL<br>
AMMONIUM SALTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention concerns personal care formulas, particularly for facial and body products, which allow visualization of underlying skin to be seen as having a healthy natural color.<br>
Vitality is often evidenced by a person's face. Appealing features include a natural look of a person's own skin. Translucency is the property of a cosmetic formula which allows light to transfer into the ■ epidermis so that underlying skin can be seen. This includes visualization of blood vessels. A pinkish healthy skin color emanates therefrom,<br>
U.S._Patent 7,175,836 B1 (Hart et al.) discloses a water-irvoil cosmetic composition containing conjugated finoleic acid which was shown to have an effect on improving brightness and radiance.<br>
An object of the present invention is. to provide a cosmetic composition. Which delivers a natural look of healthy color, particularly through achievement of improved translucency-<br>
	SUMMARYOF THE INVENTION<br>
.  A personal care composition is provided which includes:<br>
•    (i)        from 0.05% to 30% by weight of a dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salt of structure AB,<br>
wherein A is a cationic charged component of the salt AB, B is an anionic charged component of the salt AB, and A has a single quatemized nitrogen atom, at least two hydroxy groups and a molecular weight no higher than 250; (if)       from 0.01 to 30% by weight of cocoa butter, wherein the quaternary ammonium salt is a dihydroxypropyltri(C1-C3alkyl) ammonium salt.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that translucency can be imparted to skin through a composition that includes<br>
dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salts and cocoa butter.<br>
Thus, an important material of the present invention is dihydroxypropyl quaternary ammonium salts of structure AB, wherein A is a cationic charged component of the salt AB and B an anionic charged component of the salt AB, A has one quatemized nilrogen atom, at least two hydroxyl groups and a molecular weight no higher than 250 but preferably no higher than 200, and optimally no higher than 170.<br><br>
Anionic charged component B may be organic or inorganic with proviso that the material is cosmetically acceptable. Typical inorganic anions are halides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrates and borates. Most preferred are the halides, especially chloride. Organic anionic counter ions include methosulfate, toluoyl sulfate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, gluconate, and benzenesulfonate. The number and charge of negatively charged component B will be sufficient to neutralize the positive charge of component A.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the quaternary ammonium salts is the dihydroxypropyl tri(Ci-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl) ammonium salts.<br>
These salts may be obtained in a variety of synthetic procedures, most particularly by hydrolysis of chlorohydroxypropyitri(Ci-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl) ammonium salts. Ordinarily the C1-C3 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl constituent on the quatemized ammonium group will be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxymethyl and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred Is a trimethyl ammonium group known through INCI nomenclature as a "timonium" group.

Translucency measurements are reported herein. Skin is a translucent substance. When light is incident on skin, a small portion is reflected and scattered at the skin surface. Most of the light continues to penetrate into the skin to be scattered that changes the propagation direction. A portion of light also gets absorbed by skin chromophores such as blood and melanin at deeper layers of skin. The scattering of light inside the skin changes the light path and results in light diffusion from its original path. After multiple scattering, some of the light survives absorption and manages to return to the skin surface to escape into the reflection space. This portion is referred to as the diffuse reflected light. This diffuse reflected light goes through the absorption by the blood and melanin and therefore carries the distinctive signature of the absorbents that give skin its unique color.<br>
Total skin spectral reflectance is the sum of the reflectance at and beneath the skin surface. Translucency is the light penetration and diffusion inside the skin. It is dependent on the optical scattering and absorption properties of the skin. Translucency is low when the scattering and absorption coefficients are high. This corresponds to the appearance of skin being hard and opaque with more uneven texture. Translucency is high when the scattering and absorption coefficients are low. This corresponds to the appearance of skin being soft with more even texture.<br>
Translucency is related to the spectral reflectance. Skin translucency increases as the surface scattering decreases and more light penetrates into the skin. Therefore, the increase of skin translucency corresponds to the decrease of the total spectral reflectance.<br>
Measurements were performed with a Minolta Spectrophotometer CM-2500C. This instrument utilizes two pulsed xenon lamps as light source and operates over a wavelength range from 360 to 740 nm. The color space is defined by the well known L* a* b*. Measurements were done by touching the spectrophotometer probe gently against the test area and taking three repeat reflectance spectra. These measurements were done at 10 minutes, 1 hour and 3 hours after product application.<br>
Analysis of the data was as follows:<br>
1.	Reflectance spectra Change = "Spectra after application" - "Spectra of baseline (before<br>
application)".<br><br>
2.	Delta L* = L* after application - L* of baseline.<br>
3.	The translucency change was measured by delta L*: decrease L* indicates more translucency.<br>
4.	The relative translucency was measured by normalized delta L*.<br>
The normalized delta L* = delta L* / (sum of delta L* for sample A and the delta L* for sample B)<br>
The application areas were three body sites on the forearm (4x5 cm2). Samples and dosing were as follows.<br>
Site 1: Apply 2mg/cm2 sample A<br>
Site 2: Apply 0.5mg/cm2 sample B<br>
Site 3: Apply 2mg/cm2 sample A with 0.5mg/cm2 sample B (sample A and sample B mixed<br>
together on site 3)<br>
Sample A was a 12% dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride in water. Sample B was 50% cocoa butter in a carrier oil (caprylic capric triglycerides).<br>
Efficacy tests are reported in table IX. The normalized translucency values represent the change of reflectance between baseline and sample applied reflectance spectra.<br>
TABLE IX<br><br>
Sample	Active Ingredient	Normalized Translucency<br>
A (2mg/cm2)	Dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride	0.8<br>
B<br>
(0.5m g/cm2)	Cocoa butter	0.2<br>
A+   B   (mixture   of  2   mg/cm2 sample A and 0.5mg/cm2 sample B)	Dihydroxypropyltrimonium     chloride and cocoa butter mixture	1.42<br>
By itself, the cocoa butter (sample B) had only a minor positive effect upon translucency. Sample A was the dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride active which provided a much stronger improvement in translucency. Combination of the dihydroxypropyltrimonium chloride with cocoa butter unexpectedly gave a value of 1.42 revealing a substantial improvement in the healthy skin color property.<br><br>
