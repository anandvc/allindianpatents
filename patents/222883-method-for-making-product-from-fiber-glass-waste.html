Method for Making Product from Fiber Glass Waste<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
I claim the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/301,959 which was filed on<br>
June 28, 2001.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to ceramic product made from fiber glass waste; raw batch<br>
formulations for making ceramic products from fiber glass waste; and a method for making<br>
ceramic products from fiber glass waste. Examples of ceramic products that can be made by the<br>
invention are tile and brick, but other ceramic products can also be made. The invention<br>
addresses two current problems: energy usage by the ceramic industry needs to be reduced; and<br>
new technology is needed to reprocess fiber glass waste into useful products.<br>
The ceramic industry consumes large amounts of energy, especially during the firing<br>
process. Firing temperatures greater than 1200°C (2200°F) are required to sinter typical ceramic<br>
raw materials into dense products. Modifications of the raw material formulations have led to<br>
reductions in firing temperatures, but the improvements are limited because of the types of raw<br>
materials used. Most traditional ceramic products, such as tile and brick, consist mainly of clay-<br>
based raw materials, which inherently require high firing temperatures. Other ceramic<br>
manufacturing steps, such as the drying processes, are also very energy intensive. Energy costs<br>
are a major portion of the total manufacturing costs, and thus new methods to reduce the amount<br>
of energy required will be a great benefit to the ceramic industry.<br><br>
The fiber glass industry produces large amounts of fiber glass waste that currently can not<br>
be economically recycled, and thus is disposed of in landfills. Fiber glass waste is generated<br>
during the fiber forming process, and also during the manufacture of fiber glass products. Fiber<br>
glass wastes are potentially recyclable by remeJting to form new glass fibers. However, fiber<br>
glass waste is generally not remelted, because impurities in the waste lead to unacceptable levels<br>
of fiber breakage during the forming process. Recycled glass, referred to as cullet, is commonly<br>
used as 20-35% of the raw materials in the manufacture of many types of glass products. Cullet<br>
is also used in some types of fiber glass manufacturing, but is mainly from container and flat<br>
glass sources.<br>
The two main types of fiber glass are wool for insulation products, and continuous fibers<br>
for textile products. Fiber glass wool is formed by rapidly spinning molten glass through holes<br>
in a rotating cylindrical container. Continuous glass fibers are formed by drawing molten glass<br>
through precious metal bushings. In both methods the fibers are rapidly cooled by air or steam<br>
blowers. An organic chemical treatment of size is then applied to minimize fiber-to-fiber<br>
abrasion during processing, and to provide coatings necessary for the particular product<br>
application.<br>
During processing various malfunctions periodically occur, such as fiber breakage, which<br>
result in waste material. The coating of size on the fibers prevents immediate reuse of the waste<br>
as cullet, because the size causes unacceptable amounts of residual carbon to form in the melt.<br>
Additional processing steps can be used to remove the size prior to melting, but this additional<br>
processing is not economical compared to the use of raw batch materials. Studies further<br>
indicate that even when the size is removed, other contaminants are present which result in high<br>
rates of fiber breakage during forming. Because of these problems, large volumes of fiber glass<br>
waste are currently disposed of in landfills. New technology is needed to reprocess this<br>
industrial waste into useful products.<br><br>
Waste glass in the invention refers to any industrial or post-consumer fiber glass that is<br>
discarded. Any form of fiber glass, such as continuous fibers for textile products or wool for<br>
insulation products, can be used. In addition, any other forms of waste glass from fiber glass<br>
melting processes, such as drain glass, can also be used in the invention. Fiber glass waste can<br>
be obtained from fiber glass manufacturers, but other sources of fiber glass can also be used.<br>
There are various types of fiber glass compositions designed for a wide range of applications.<br>
Fiber glass compositions typically soften from about 650 to about 800°C. This unique softening<br>
behavior causes articles formed from fine powders of fiber glass to density by viscous-phase<br>
sintering at temperatures much lower than usually required to fire ceramic products. The<br>
invention utilizes the low-temperature densification behavior of fiber glass to reduce<br>
manufacturing costs by conserving energy and lowering equipment and maintenance expenses.<br>
The invention is novel, because a high-quality ceramic product can be manufactured at<br>
low cost from up to 100% fiber glass waste. The invention conserves energy and natural<br>
resources compared to traditional ceramic processing methods. An impervious ceramic<br>
microstructure with only a small amount of porosity can be achieved. Impervious refers to<br>
ceramic products with very low water absorptions of less than 0.5%. An impervious ceramic<br>
microstructure with a small amount of porosity is critical to achieve high-quality properties.<br>
Ceramic products can be produced by the invention with a wide range of colors with smooth<br>
glossy glaze-like surfaces. The surface texture and other fired properties can also be adjusted by<br>
the addition of fillers, and/or by partial crystallization of the glass.<br>
Previous methods have been developed to produce ceramic products from waste glass.<br>
U.S. Patent # 6,340,650 reviews processing problems that result from previous methods, and<br>
provides a method to eliminate these problems by avoiding the use of water and clay in the<br>
processing. There are several types of fiber glass compositions. These compositions are<br>
designed to be less susceptible to chemical reaction with water compared to container and flat<br>
glass compositions, because of the large surface area of fiber glass. Less sensitivity to reaction<br>
with water allows greater flexibility in processing of fiber glass compared to container or flat<br><br>
glass. In addition, some fiber glass compositions, such as E-glass, have higher softening<br>
temperatures compared to container and flat glass compositions. The higher softening<br>
temperature allows clay and other ceramic raw materials that produce volatile species during<br>
firing to be included in the raw batch formulation without adversely affecting the densification<br>
behavior. The present invention provides a method of making ceramic products from fiber glass<br>
waste where water and clay can be added during processing.<br>
It was also unexpected that the use of fiber glass would provide several other significant<br>
advantages compared to the use of container or flat glass. This is because of differences in<br>
composition and contaminants, but especially because of the different forms of glass (fibers<br>
versus bulk glass). Processing container or flat glass into a fine powder involves two or three<br>
energy-intensive crushing and grinding steps. Glass fibers are typically 3-100 micrometers in<br>
diameter, and thus only one dimension needs to be broken to produce very fine powder.<br>
Chopping or milling of fiber glass is much simpler and less energy intensive compared to<br>
crushing container or flat glass. Industrial sources of fiber glass waste are very uniform in<br>
composition with much less contamination compared to post consumer container glass. This<br>
allows more control over color and other properties of the ceramic product produced. In<br>
addition, the significantly lower thermal expansion coefficients of fiber glass compositions<br>
compared to container and flat glass offers the possibility of improved thermal shock resistance.<br>
The invention offers a variety of environmental benefits compared to current practices.<br>
The method completely transforms fiber glass into a dense ceramic product, so that all future<br>
environmental problems in the handling and disposal of the fibers is eliminated. By using<br>
recycled glass as the raw material; mining, processing, and transportation of traditional raw<br>
materials is not required. The invention requires substantially less energy compared to<br>
traditional clay-based tile production, and especially compared to glass-melting methods of<br>
producing tile. This is mainly because of greatly reduced firing temperatures of 700-1000°C,<br>
compared to 1200°C for clay-based tile, and &gt;1500°C for melt-based tile.<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a method to transform large quantities of fiber glass waste into<br>
useful ceramic products by a low-cost manufacturing process. The method consists of reducing<br>
the fiber glass waste into a glass powder; mixing the glass powder with additives into a glass-<br>
additives mixture; granulating the glass-additives mixture into granulated particles; forming the<br>
granulated particles into a green ceramic article; and heating the green ceramic article into the<br>
ceramic product. Water and clay can be included in the processing. Only one firing step is<br>
needed with a low peak firing temperature of about 700°C to about 1000°C. The method<br>
conserves energy and natural resources compared to clay-based traditional ceramic<br>
manufacturing. High-quality impervious ceramic products can be produced by the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The raw batch formulations of the invention consist of 70-100% fiber glass waste, 0-20%<br>
filler, and 0-10% organic binder. Preferred raw batch formulations consist of 84-100% waste<br>
glass, 0-10% filler, and 0-6% organic binder. All percentages are based on weight. It is also<br>
understood that other common ceramic processing additives, such as wetting agents, surfactants,<br>
deflocculants, coagulants, flocculants, plasticizers, antifoaming agents, lubricants, preservatives,<br>
etc. can be added to the raw batch formulation to further optimize the processing without<br>
changing the scope of the invention.<br>
The organic binder and other organic additives (if included) will bum out during firing,<br>
and thus are not part of the final product. The fiber glass waste and filler are inorganic<br>
components that remain after firing, and make up the final product composition. The initial raw<br>
batch formulation (given above) therefore transforms during firing to the final product<br>
composition consisting of 80-100% fiber glass waste and 0-20% filler. The preferred final<br>
product composition consists of 90-100% waste glass and 0-10% filler. The final product<br><br>
composition is determined by subtracting the organic binder amount from the raw batch<br>
formulation, and then renormallizing the remaining composition to 100%.<br>
The filler in the invention is a ceramic raw material added to modify the color, surface<br>
texture, or any other property of the final product, or to act as an inorganic binder. An inorganic<br>
binder filler, such as clay or sodium silicate, will act as a binder during the granulation and<br>
pressing steps, and reduce or eliminate the need for the organic binder. The addition of a filler is<br>
not necessary to make a high quality ceramic product, but may be desired to produce a specific<br>
set of properties in the final product. A wide range of filler additives can be used in the<br>
invention individually or in combination.<br>
A filler added to control the color is referred to as a colorant. Common ceramic colorants<br>
can be used to produce ceramic products by the invention with a wide range of colors. Examples<br>
of individual oxide colorants are cobalt oxide to produce blue colors, chromium oxide for greens,<br>
and iron oxide for reds. Many commercial colorants are available based on complicated<br>
combinations of oxides which are often melted to form glass frits. In addition to the color, the<br>
addition of fillers can control other characteristics and properties, such as surface texture,<br>
crystallization behavior, and mechanical, thermal, arid chemical durability properties. Other<br>
examples of fillers are alumina, silica, zirconia, and clay.<br>
The fiber glass waste and fillers must be in powder form to be used in the raw batch<br>
formulations. The powder particle size required depends on the final properties desired. For the<br>
invention the fiber glass waste and filler powders have particle sizes 
preferred size is 
length, because the fiber diameters are less than the required sizes. Coarser particle size fillers<br>
can also be included in the raw batch formulations to adjust the properties of the final product.<br>
For example, coarser fillers can be added to produce a rougher surface texture to increase the<br>
coefficient of friction and slip resistance.<br><br>
The organic binder in the invention consists of any organic material that can be added to<br>
bond the inorganic waste glass and filler particles together. The organic binder is initially mixed<br>
with fiber glass waste and filler particles to form a granulated free-flowing powder. This<br>
powder is then formed into the ceramic articles. After the forming step, the organic binder<br>
provides enough strength in the unfired article for handling and transport to the firing step. The<br>
amount of organic binder needed can be reduced, or even eliminated, if an inorganic binder is<br>
added as a filler.<br>
Examples of organic binders are natural gums, cellulose ethers, polymerized alcohols,<br>
acrylic resins, glycols, and waxes. Polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohol were used as<br>
organic binders in the examples of the invention given below. Other organic binders can be used<br>
without changing the scope of the invention. To be effective the organic binder needs to be in<br>
liquid form, so that the inorganic fiber glass and filler particles can be wetted and coated by the<br>
organic binder. Organic binders at room temperature (-20°C) are in either liquid or solid states.<br>
A solid organic binder can be dissolved in specific liquids, mixed with the inorganic powders,<br>
and then dried to remove the liquid to produce an inorganic powder coated with the organic<br>
binder. In the invention water or nonaqueous liquids, such as alcohols, are used to dissolve the<br>
solid organic binders. If the organic binder is in a liquid form, then an additional liquid is not<br>
required.<br>
The following paragraphs describe details of each step of the method of the<br>
invention. The first step of the method consists of preparation of glass powder. Industrial fiber<br>
glass waste, with or without organic size applied, can be used as the starting glass to prepare the<br>
powder. Any other type or form of fiber glass waste can also be used. The method of the<br>
invention is not sensitive to normal levels of contaminants in the fiber glass waste, and thus<br>
cleaning of the glass is not required. The fiber glass waste is reduced in particle size (or fiber<br>
length) down to 
<br>
The procedure used for particle size reduction depends on the composition of the fiber<br>
glass waste, and also on the form of the fiber glass waste. A wide range of fiber glass<br>
compositions are produced in many different forms, which results in a variety of types of fiber<br>
glass waste. All types of fiber glass waste can be reduced in particle size by procedures which<br>
avoid the use of water in the processing. This is critical for fiber glass compositions which are<br>
adversely affected by reaction with water during processing. Fiber glass compositions which are<br>
not adversely affected by reaction with water during processing can be reduced in particle size<br>
by procedures which use water in the processing.<br>
Prior to particle size reduction, the fiber glass waste can be heated to remove any water<br>
that may be present. If the temperature is high enough, organic matter, such as the organic size,<br>
can be removed prior to particle size reduction. Heating fiber glass waste can also cause the<br>
glass fibers to become more friable, which allows the fibers to be broken and crushed more<br>
easily. The particle size of the fiber glass waste can be reduced by any type of chopping,<br>
crushing, grinding, milling, etc. process. Several types of common ceramic processing<br>
equipment can be used for particle size reduction, such as a choppers, jaw or cone crushers, ball<br>
mills, hammer mills, vibratory mills, attrition mills, roller mills, etc. After particle size<br>
reduction, the fiber glass powder is screened through a 30 mesh sieve (or 100 mesh for the<br>
preferred particle size).<br>
The fine glass powder (
method is combined with the desired amounts of fillers and organic binder based on the raw<br>
batch formulation used. The amounts of each component are weighed on a balance,<br>
combined, and then mixed. The organic binder is added in liquid form, either because the<br>
starting binder is a liquid, or because the binder is dissolved in water or a nonaqueous liquid,<br>
such as an alcohol. The liquid organic binder is combined with the glass and filler powders, and<br>
mixed in any type of mixer that will produce a granulated free-flowing powder, such as a pan<br>
mixer, conical blender, ribbon mixer, rotating drum mixer, etc. Excess liquid can be removed by<br><br>
drying in a drier, such as a fluid bed drier, or by spray drying. However, it is preferred to keep<br>
the liquid content low enough, so that a drying step is not required.<br>
The granulated free-flowing powder of the raw batch formulation is formed into a green<br>
ceramic article. Green here refers to the unfired ceramic. Any type of forming method can<br>
be used, but preferably dry pressing is used. For dry pressing the powder is placed in a metal die<br>
of the desired shape and pressed with rams to compact the powder. The pressed article is then<br>
removed from the die and fired in a kiln or furnace. If a liquid is present in the pressed article,<br>
then an additional drying step in an oven can be included before firing to remove any remaining<br>
liquid.<br>
The initial stage of the firing process consists of binder burnout to remove the organic<br>
binder. Preferably the binder burnout is conducted during the initial heating of the ceramic<br>
articles for firing. Separate processes of binder burnout and firing can also be used. In either<br>
case the organic binder must be completely removed prior to the softening and sintering of the<br>
glass powder to prevent defects from developing in the fired product. Organic binders typically<br>
burnout from about 200-400°C. The specific firing profile of temperature and time will depend<br>
on the raw batch formulation used. Preferably the temperature and time required are minimized,<br>
while still resulting in nearly 0% porosity. The maximum firing temperature required ranges<br>
from about 700°C to about 1000°C.<br>
The following paragraphs provide 25 examples of the invention.<br>
Example 1: The raw batch formulation of Example 1 consisted of 100% fiber glass waste<br>
which was obtained from a fiber glass manufacturer. The waste was from E-glass continuous<br>
fiber glass production, and had organic size applied. The fibers had been processed into small<br>
pieces by the fiber glass manufacturer. In the first step, the fiber glass waste was ground into a<br>
fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder was then sieved through 100 mesh (
mm). The sieved powder was pressed at 5,000 psi (pounds per square inch) without binder into a<br><br>
16 mm diameter cylindrical sample in a metal die using a hydraulic press. The pressed sample<br>
was fired in a programmable box furnace to first burnout the organic size, and then to sinter the<br>
glass powder into a dense ceramic product. A maximum temperature of 900°C was used. The<br>
resulting ceramic product had a density of 2.60 g/cc, which is greater than 99% of the theoretical<br>
density of E-glass of 2.61 g/cc. The ceramic product was translucent with smooth glaze-like<br>
surfaces.<br>
Example 2: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste used in Example 1 was replaced by fiber glass wool<br>
from an insulation product, and the maximum firing temperature was changed to 750°C. A high<br>
quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 3: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste used in Example 1 was replaced by drain glass, and the<br>
glass was heated to 130°C to remove water before grinding with the mortar and pestle. The drain<br>
glass was obtained from a fiber glass melting furnace by a fiber glass manufacturer. The drain<br>
glass was in the form of bulk pieces of glass. A high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to<br>
Example 1 with a density of 2.61 g/cc and smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 4: The same procedure described above for Example 3 was also used for this<br>
example, except that six weight percent polyvinyl alcohol binder was added to the glass powder<br>
as described below, and a 1.25 inch square shaped sample was pressed. The polyvinyl alcohol<br>
binder was first dissolved in water, and then mixed with the glass powder. The glass-binder<br>
mixture was dried in an oven at about 90cC to remove the water. The dried mixture was ground<br>
with a mortar and pestle, and sieved through 30 mesh. After the pressing and firing steps, a<br>
high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.59 g/cc and<br>
smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br><br>
Example 5: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste used in Example 1 was replaced by a second E-glass<br>
continuous fiber glass waste, and the glass was heated to 800°C before grinding in the mortar<br>
and pestle. This waste was obtained from a fiber glass manufacturer, and did not have organic<br>
size applied. The fibers were about 12 inches in length, which was much larger than the fiber<br>
lengths of the fiber glass waste used in Example 1. A high-quality ceramic product resulted<br>
similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.61 g/cc and smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 6: The same procedure described above for Example 5 was also used for this<br>
example, except that six weight percent polyvinyl alcohol binder was added to the glass powder<br>
as described below, and a 1.2S inch square shaped sample was pressed. The polyvinyl alcohol<br>
binder was first dissolved in water, and then mixed with the glass powder. The glass-binder<br>
mixture was dried in an oven at about 90cC to remove the water. The dried mixture was ground<br>
with a mortar and pestle, and sieved through 30 mesh. After the pressing and firing steps, a<br>
high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.60 g/cc and<br>
smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 7: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste used in Example 1 was replaced by a third E-glass<br>
continuous fiber glass waste, and the glass was heated to 800°C before grinding in the mortar<br>
and pestle. This waste was obtained from a fiber glass manufacturer, and had a larger amount of<br>
organic size applied compared to the fiber glass waste used in Example 1. The fibers were about<br>
12 inches in length, which was much larger than the fiber lengths of the fiber glass waste used in<br>
Example 1. A high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.60<br>
g/cc and smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 8: The same procedure described above for Example 7 was also used for this<br>
example, except that six weight percent polyvinyl alcohol binder was added to the glass powder<br>
as described below, and a 1.25 inch square shaped sample was pressed. The polyvinyl alcohol<br><br>
binder was first dissolved in water, and then mixed with the glass powder. The glass-binder<br>
mixture was dried in an oven at about 90°C to remove the water. The dried mixture was ground<br>
with a mortar and pestle, and sieved through 30 mesh. After the pressing and firing steps, a<br>
high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.59 g/cc and<br>
smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 9: The same procedure described above for Example 7 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste was heated to 750°C, instead of 800°C, before<br>
grinding in the mortar and pestle. A high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1<br>
with a density of 2.63 g/cc and smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 10: The same procedure described above for Example 9 was also used for this<br>
example, except that six weight percent polyethylene glycol binder was mixed with the glass.<br>
The polyethylene glycol binder was in liquid form at room temperature, and thus no additional<br>
liquid was added. After the pressing and firing steps, a high-quality ceramic product resulted<br>
similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.60 g/cc and smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Example 11: The same procedure described above for Example 9 was also used for this<br>
example, except that six weight percent polyvinyl alcohol binder was added to the glass powder<br>
as described below, and a 1.25 inch square shaped sample was pressed. The polyvinyl alcohol<br>
binder was first dissolved in water, and then mixed with the glass powder. The glass-binder<br>
mixture was dried in an oven at about 95°C to remove the water. The dried mixture was ground<br>
with a mortar and pestle, and sieved through 100 mesh. After the pressing and firing steps, a<br>
high-quality ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.59 g/cc and<br>
smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Examples 12-14: The same procedure described above for Example 11 was also used for<br>
these examples, except that 2.5 weight percent of the fiber glass waste was replaced with a<br>
colorant filler. Three commercially available ceramic colorants were evaluated (also referred to<br><br>
as ceramic stains). Example 12 used a white colorant; Example 13 a light blue colorant; and<br>
Example 14 a dark blue colorant. High quality ceramic products resulted similar to Example 1,<br>
except that the colors of the ceramic products corresponded to the colorant used. The densities<br>
of the ceramic products ranged from 2.60 to 2.63 g/cc. These examples demonstrate the ability<br>
of producing ceramic products with different colors by the invention.<br>
Example 15: The same procedure described above for Example 7 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste was milled instead of grinding with a mortar and pestle<br>
as described below, and polyethylene glycol binder was added as described in Example 10.<br>
After heating at 800°C, the fiber glass waste was milled in water in an alumina ball mill with<br>
alumina media, and then sieved through 100 mesh (
in an oven at about 115°C to remove the water. The dried glass powder was sieved again<br>
through 100 mesh (
ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1 with a density of 2.63 g/cc and smooth glaze-like<br>
surfaces.<br>
Examples 16-22: The same procedure described above for Example 15 was also used for<br>
these examples, except that 2.5 weight percent of the fiber glass waste was replaced with a<br>
colorant filler. Seven commercially available ceramic colorants were evaluated (also referred to<br>
as ceramic stains). Example 16 used a white colorant; Example 17 a yellow colorant; Example<br>
18 a green colorant; Example 19 used a light blue colorant; Example 20 a dark blue colorant;<br>
Example 21a red colorant; and Example 22 a black colorant. High quality ceramic products<br>
resulted similar to Example 1, except that the colors of the ceramic products corresponded to the<br>
colorant used. The densities of the ceramic products ranged from 2.61 to 2.66 g/cc. These<br>
examples demonstrate the ability of producing ceramic products with a wide range of colors by<br>
the invention.<br>
Examples 23-24: The same procedure described above for Example 7 was also used for<br>
these examples, except that the fiber glass waste was milled instead of grinding with a mortar<br><br>
and pestle as described below, and 5.0 weight percent of the fiber glass waste was replaced with<br>
a filler. After heating at 800°C, the fiber glass waste was milled in water in an alumina ball mill<br>
with alumina media, and then sieved through 100 mesh (
dried in an oven at about 115°C to remove the water. The dried glass powder was sieved again<br>
through 100 mesh (
powder, and Example 24 used a filler of alumina powder. High quality ceramic products<br>
resulted similar to Example 1, except that the surface texture of the ceramic products roughened.<br>
The density of the ceramic products of both examples was 2.61 g/cc. These examples<br>
demonstrate the ability of utilizing filler additives to change the surface texture of ceramic<br>
products made by the invention.<br>
Examples 25: The same procedure described above for Example 7 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the fiber glass waste was milled instead of grinding with a mortar and pestle<br>
as described below, and 5.0 weight percent of the fiber glass waste was replaced with a filler.<br>
After heating at 800°C, the fiber glass waste was milled in water in an alumina ball mill with<br>

in an oven at about 115°C to remove the water. The dried glass powder was sieved again<br>
through 100 mesh (
ceramic product resulted similar to Example 1. The density of the ceramic product was 2.58<br>
g/cc. This example demonstrates the ability of utilizing a clay filler additive to act as an<br>
inorganic binder during processing.<br>
A detailed description of the invention with examples was described above. It is<br>
understood that various other changes and modifications can be made to the present invention by<br>
those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, a glaze<br>
can also be applied to the ceramic product if desired, but is not necessary. A glaze can be<br>
applied before firing, so that only one firing is required. A glaze can also be applied after firing,<br>
but then a second firing is required.<br><br>
