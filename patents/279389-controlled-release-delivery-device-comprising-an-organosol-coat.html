				<td>The present application claims benefit of priority from US Patent Application No.11/396,166 filed April 3, 2006<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the controlled delivery of active ingredient(s). The present invention also relates to the use and method for making the same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many pharmaceutical oral dosage forms for sustained release of drugs are taught in the prior art. Some of these are in form of swellable matrices in which drug release is via tortuous channels controlled by a swelling polymer. Some are reservoir systems in which drug release is via a laser drilled pin hole controlled by osmotic pressure- While some are beads surrounded by a coat impregnated with soluble materials in which drug release is via channels created by the dissolution of the soluble materials. Coats have been used as means to control the site of release of an active ingredient.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,146 teaches a coating composition for coating a solid dosage form of a medicament having at least 50% (w/w) by dry weight of a water insoluble polymer insoluble in both acidic, basic and neutral pH, present in the form of an aqueous latex dispersion and a water soluble component present in a weight ratio of about 5 to about 50% (w/w) by dry weight of the coating, the water soluble component being organic and either solid or liquid and said water soluble component being selected from the group consisting of polydextrose, polyalcohol or ester of polyalcohol, a non-polymeric sugar, a non-polymeric sugar alcohol and amino acid, and the ratio of water insoluble polymer to water soluble component ranging from about<br>
95:5 to about 1:1.   The solid content in the coating composition ranging from about 5% to about 25%. As discussed below, inherent disadvantages exist in the use of aqueous latex dispersion of water insoluble polymer for coating.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,911,217 teaches a controlled release bead comprising (i) a core unit of a substantially water-soluble or water-swellable inert material; (ii) a first layer on the core unit of a substantially water-insoluble polymer; (iii) a second layer covering the first layer and containing an active ingredient; and (iv) a third layer of polymer on the second layer effective for controlled release of the active ingredient, wherein the first layer is adapted to control water penetration into the core. This approach is complicated by the core requiring protection from water throughout manufacture.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,902,742 describes a multiparticulate modified release composition comprising a first population of active ingredient-containing particles and at least one subsequent population of active ingredient-containing particles, the active ingredient contained in the first population being an opiate and the active ingredient in the subsequent population being an opiate or a non-opiate, wherein the subsequent population of active ingredient-containing particles further comprises a modified release coating or, alternatively or additionally, a modified release matrix material, such that the composition following oral delivery to a subject delivers the active ingredients of the first and subsequent populations in a pulsatile manner. A problem with matrix formulated material is that it is susceptible to dose dumping under feed conditions and a burst effect under fasted conditions.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,432 describes a dosage form for delivery of one or more beneficial agents into a fluid, such as liquid enteral nutritional product. The dosage form unit includes a core containing at least one beneficial agent, preferably a marker dye, which is dispersible in the fluid. A latex coating encases the core. The latex coating includes a mixture containing a substantially hydrophobic base material, preferably formed from an emulsion of cellulose acetate microspheres, which is capable of defining a matrix-type membrane, and at least one hydrophilie component being dispersible in the fluid. A dispersible beneficial agent is preferred as one of the hydrophilic<br>
components of the latex coating to allow immediate release of the beneficial agent therefrom. Problems with latex coating compositions are discussed below. Furthermore, matrix type membranes are susceptible to dose dumping under feed conditions and a burst effect under fasted conditions.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,562 relates to microcapsules for the oral administration of medicinal and/or nutritional active principles, which are smaller than or equal to 1000 micrometers in size and consist of particles which are coated with a coating material consisting of a mixture of a film-forming polymer derivative, a hydrophobic plasticizer, a functional agent and a nitrogen-containing polymer<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,335 describes a system for the controlled release of an active agent and is made of a core surrounded by a shell made of a wall formed of a water-insoluble material which is permeable to the passage of an external fluid. The core is comprised of a water soluble active agent and a soluble polymeric adjuvant, such as polyvinyl alcohols, and a cellulose compound such as methyl cellulose, methylethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, capable of unlimited swelling. Placing swelling materials in the core complicates the manufacturing process<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,215 discloses controlled release beads where each bead comprises (i) a core unit of a soluble or insoluble inert material, (ii) a first layer on the core unit comprising an active ingredient dispersed in a hydrophilic polymer, (iii) an optional second layer of hydrophilic polymer covering the first layer, and (iv) an outermost membrane layer effective for controlled release of the active ingredient. The core is not used to contain the drug and therefore lower amounts of the drug are typically loaded in this form.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,577 discloses a compressed medicinal tablet comprising a tablet core and a sugar coating, where the sugar contains a dose of a hormonal steroid, a drug and a steroid release rate controlling amount of microcrystalline cellulose, and PVP to aid in application of the sugar coat. The sugar coating technique is time consuming and prone to variability.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,159 discloses a controlled release pharmaceutical tablet. This system is based on a core which contains a water soluble osmotic agent, a water-swellable pharmaceutically acceptable polymer and surrounded by a membrane coating made essentially of a modified water insoluble polymer and a water soluble polymer. Inclusion of osmotic agent and swellable polymer complicates manufacturing as the core must be protected from water.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,762 describes stabilized pulverulent active agents, compositions made by coating with a coating composition comprising at least one film-forming agent, in proportions of between 2 and 25% by weight of the final mass,, and at least one pore-forming agent, in proportions of between 0 and 5% by weight of the final mass<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,887 discloses a controlled release dosage form consisting of an osmotic core comprising essentially of a drug and water swellable component selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyethylene oxide wherein the core is surrounded with a coat comprising of a water resistant polymer and a minor amount of a non-toxic water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable compound (e.g., salt crystals) in an amount which is sufficient to dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluid and form a plurality of micropores on the outside of the tablet, the water resistant polymer being microporus to the passage of the gastrointestinal fluid. Drug release is via the passage way created when the water soluble salt crystals is dissolved in contact with the aqueous medium.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,388 describes a water soluble drug core surrounded by a hydratable diffusion barrier made of a film-forming polymer such as an acrylic resin or ethyl cellulose and an additive which controls the rate of hydration and permeability of the hydratable diffusion barrier selected from the group consisting of fully esterified acrylic resins containing quaternary amine side chains, lubricant anionic surfactants, plasticizers, inert water soluble materials and mixtures thereof. The present invention does not teach the use of a hydratable diffusion barrier made from esterified acrylic<br>
resins and drug release is not controlled by the rate of hydration of the coating.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,146 discloses a microporous, cellulosic coating useful in combination with osmotically controlled drug delivery devices. The coating composition consist essentially of a single layer surrounding a core compartment comprising: a latex derived from an aqueous colloidal dispersion of a cellulosic polymer, surfactant, plasticizer and a pore-forming agent selected from the group consisting of urea, dimethyl sulfone, nicotinamide, or an amino acid.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,768 describes a sustained release oral dosage form made by compressing an active ingredient plus a high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or other cellulose ether. The dosage form in 768 is a matrix system and is subject to dose dumping especially when taken with food.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,365 describes a controlled release dosage form which consists essentially of a core containing a medicament; an inner coating layer composed of ethylcellulose and a hydrophobic substance; and an outer coating layer containing a medicament are also disclosed. This dosage form uses only water insoluble substances for its inner coating layer and relies solely on an outer coating layer containing a medicament to obtain the required loading dose for rapid increase in blood concentration of the medicament.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,886,668 and 4,880,631 directed to osmotic pumps, for the controlled release of an active substance, teach a core surrounded by a rate controlling water insoluble wall as coat which utilizes a polymer permeable to water but impermeable to solute and a pH insensitive pore forming additive dispersed through the wall.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,989 describe an osmotic system comprising a wall comprising, in at least a part, of a semipermeable material that surrounds a compartment. The compartment contains an osmotic composition and drug, and a second and different osmotic composition. The drug is released with aid<br>
of osmotic tension via a passageway in the wall that connects the first osmotic composition with the exterior of the system.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,393 discloses sustained release therapeutic compressed solid unit dose forms of an active ingredient plus a carrier base comprised of a high molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and or other cellulose ether. This system is subject to dose dumping especially when taken with food.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,330,338 ('338 Patent) describes pharmaceutical coatings in the form of aqueous dispersions or latex preparation of a water insoluble polymer, such as ethyl cellulose. Tablet cores coated according to the '338 Patent release active agent by diffusion, which can be an exceedingly slow process unless systems with a large surface area are utilized. To expedite release of active agent from tablets coated with, e.g., an ethyl cellulose coating prepared in accordance with the disclosure of the '338 Patent, hydroxypropylmethycellulose (HPMC) has been added to the coating. '338 further discloses that HPMC, enhances the water solubility of the ethyl cellulose coats, causing the coating and subsequently the tablet core to rapidly disintegrate in an environment of use such as the intestine. Such rapid disintegration, however, is unsuitable for those applications in which drug is to be delivered continuously over time such as those taught in the present invention.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,31,285 disloses an osmotic device having coat comprising an annealed subcoat and an overcoat, annealed at about 35 degree C to 65 degree C for 10 to 72 hours.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,248,856 disclose the use of sugar coating in conjunction with a barrier coating on a core containing medicament and the cellulose polymers hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and ethylcellulose in order to provide controlled release of pharmaceuticals.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,060,598 teaches a coated pharmaceutical tablet comprising a core of active material and at least one layer of a coating made up of a film forming aqueous synthetic resin dispersion (such as polyvinyl esters, polyacrylic acid esters, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride or<br>
butadienestyrene copolymers) and a water or alkaline soluble material. It further describes the resulting coated tablet as a core surrounded by a continuous porous matrix of synthetic resin formed from the aqueous dispersion which is insoluble in water and insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract. '598 patent also describes the coating as achieving fast disintegrating or enteric disintegrating coating for tablets<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,880 describes a tablet having an osmotic material and a sustained release coating. The drug is released through passages in the coating caused by structural weaknesses.<br>
Most of the controlled release technologies described in the prior art above have as a common feature, a rate controlling membrane surrounding a core which comprise of drug and controlled release polymer and/or an osmotic agent or in some cases the core contain no drug. In many of the aforementioned disclosures, the membrane is made from water insoluble polymers, and various additives are added in various forms to alter the permeability of the membrane to allow and control the rate of release of drug. Some of them require the presence of certain ingredients, e.g., osmotic ingredients, for the formulation to function.<br>
The coating and core compositions described in the prior art have disadvantages. Sugar coating of a solid dosage has the drawback of being a very involved process requiring highly skilled operators and it has no application in controlled release drug delivery. The problem with osmotic devices is that they are tedious and difficult to fabricate. Their efficiency and precision is also in doubt as they have been known to break up prematurely or retain some of the drug content during transit in the gastrointestinal tract, which may lead to less drug being released and delivered by such devices. It is, therefore, not uncommon for such devices to contain an overage of drug of at least 10% to account for such inefficiencies in dose delivery. This practice is not economical and presents a danger, especially if potent drugs are used, as these devices have been known to rupture in transit thus releasing excess dose.<br>
There has been a move towards aqueous coating systems such as aqueous based synthetic polymer dispersions which are produced by emulsion polymerization and latex dispersions. This is because these aqueous systems are nonflammable and thus provide no explosion hazard, is substantially free of toxic effects and is innocuous to the environment. However, the use of aqueous systems of polymers for film coating to provide dosage coatings has its draw backs, these systems are subject to bacterial and mold growth without the presence of a preservative agent and the presence of pore forming materials as suggested by the prior art may cause coalescence or coagulation of the latex dispersion, which may render it un¬usable. These lattices also require the presence of surfactants in order to stabilize the latex dispersions from coalescence. Furthermore, in order to obtain a coating of uniform thickness and integrity there is need to subject the latex coated dosage form to a curing process by heating under high temperature. Latex dispersions have a high tacking factor, curing tends to result in an irreversible agglomeration of the dosage form and damage of the coating upon separation of the dosage forms. This results in a faster release than with uncured dosage forms.<br>
Use of aqueous coating systems is complicated further by the slow evaporation of water and large amounts of water which must be removed from each coating. Further, many drugs are sensitive to water when exposed to high concentrations for extended periods of time and, accordingly, require initial sealing with water barriers<br>
The use of additives or soluble components in latex coating compositions as suggested in the pnor art can lead to film instability during coating. Films formed with the addition of the soluble component are weaker than the film formed by using the insoluble polymer latex alone. This is because of the mechanisms by which latex films are deposited and formed around a substrate. The film is formed by the coalescence of the polymer latex particles. The presence of the water soluble component which is not soluble or physically compatible with the polymer would prevent complete coalescence of the polymeric particles and thus produces a weaker film. At<br>
high concentrations the water soluble component will help cause erosion of the film formed from latex systems. It is therefore critical that the water soluble component is soluble in water and the solubility is in excess of 5% (w/w). Latex systems are limited with regards to the amount of soluble and or swellable components that can be added to the system.<br>
Therefore, there is still a need to develop a stable drug delivery device that can be reproducibly manufactured and have a desired effect of controlled release.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel composition and to a method of using and preparing same in order to control the rate and extent of delivery of an active ingredient. This is accomplished by the use of a homogenous polymeric coat comprising a water soluble gel forming polymer and a water insoluble organosoluble polymer. The active ingredient may be, without limitation, an active pharmaceutical ingredient; or biological, chemical, nutraceutical, agricultural or nutritional ingredients. The active ingredient may be in any suitable particle known in the art, for example, without limitation, granules, tablets, capsules, spheroids, pellets, microspheres, nanospheres, microcapsules, or crystals.<br>
More specifically, the novel composition of the present invention can be used in any delivery device such as, and without being limited thereto, a sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release and/or controlled release device that controls the release of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients.   The device can be a solid unit dosage form. The device can be elected from, for example, one or more granules, one or more compressed tablets, one or more pellets and/or one or more capsules. In a specific embodiment, the device is a stable single homogeneous unit controlled release device which controls the release rate, without significant variability, and with a reproducible controlled release rate.<br>
The composition may be administered in any suitable manner. For example and without being limited thereto, the composition can be in the form of a suitable device for in vivo oral, vaginal, anal, ocular, subcutaneous, intramuscular administration or for implantation. The composition may also be used for in vitro or ex vivo delivery of an active ingredient.<br>
In one example, a non-rupturing controlled release delivery device for controlled release of an active ingredient comprises: (a) a core particle comprising the active ingredient homogenously dispersed therein; and (b) a polymeric coat comprising a water soluble gel forming polymer and a water<br>
insoluble organosoluble polymer, the polymeric coat being applied directly to and substantially enveloping the core particle.<br>

The term "polymeric coating" or "polymeric coat" means any coating which is formed by polymerization of one or more monomers to form linear or branched or cross-linked macromolecules. The coating may be variously characterized as a coating, layer, membrane, shell, capsule, or the like, and substantially surrounds or envelope a core particle. Where a device of the present invention comprises more than one polymeric coat, a first polymeric coat substantially surrounds or envelopes a core particle, a second polymeric coat substantially surrounds or envelopes the first polymeric coat, and so forth. A subsequent (for example, second) polymeric coat may be applied to a previous (for example, first) polymeric coat in a contiguous or non¬contiguous fashion. While second, third or further subsequent coats may take the form and composition of any known compatible controlled-release coat, for example a pH sensitive coat, a water repellant coat, or an aqueous solvent<br>
based coat, it will be understood that the first polymeric coat typically comprises a homogenous mixture of a water soluble gel forming polymer and a water insoluble organosoluble polymer in an organosolvent.<br>
A polymeric coat prepared from a homogenous mixture comprising a water soluble gel forming polymer and a water insoluble organosoluble polymer in an organosolvent may be referred to as an "organosol polymeric coat". While the preparation of the first polymeric coat or the organosol polymeric coat is substantially non-aqueous, small amounts of water may be used or tolerated, for example, less than about 20% (v/v), less than about 10% (v/v), less than about 5% (v/v) or less than about 2% (v/v) of the polymeric coating composition before application to or incorporation into the controlled-release delivery device<br>
The term "organosolvent" means any organic solvent that is at least somewhat water soluble, having a Hildebrand Solubility Parameter of at least about 7.5 or 8 (Cal/cc).sup.1/2, usually at least about 9, more usually at least about 10. The organosolvent will have a dipole moment of at least about 1.5 D, usually at least about 2.0 D. One or more than one organosolvent may be used in the preparation of a polymeric coating composition. Typically, the organosolvent component of a polymeric coating composition will consist of one or two types of organosolvents, but may if desired consist of three, four or more organoolvents. The organosolvent component will make up the majority of the polymeric coating composition ranging from about 50 to 99.5% (v/v) of the composition, or from about 70 to 98% (v/v) of the composition, typically from about 75 to 97% (v/v) of the composition before application to or incorporation into the controlled-release delivery device. Organosolvents may be chosen such that any residual solvent that remains in an organosol polymeric coat does not result in an unacceptable systemic toxicity when a controlled-release delivery device comprising the organosol polymeric coat is administered or used to treat a subject or patient. When choosing organosolvents consideration may also be given to toxic effects that may be experienced by workers responsible for handling solvents in manufacturing or production of a controlled release delivery device. For example, methylene<br>
chloride is listed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists as a potential carcinogen as well as a potential cause of CNS depression, liver and kidney damage, and potential cause of elevated blood carboxyhemoglobin (also caused by exposure to carbon monoxide). Contact of the liquid with skin or eyes causes painful irritation and possible burns. Methylene chloride is considered an unsuitable organosolvent in the context of the present invention and will typically not be included in significant amounts in an organosolvent polymeric coating composition, for example less than 5%, or less than 4%, or less than 3%, or less than 2%, or less than 1% (v/v) based on the total volume of organosolvent used in preparation of an organosol polymeric coat. In certain examples, the amount of methylene chloride is less than or equal to a trace amount.<br>
Examples of suitable organosolvents are described in US Patent No 6,630,168 issued October 7, 2003, titled "Gel delivery vehicles for anticellular proliferative agents". Suitable organosolvents may comprise Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Sulfur, Hydrogen and Phosphorus atoms, and may be cyclic or heterocyclic, and will generally be of low molecular weight, typically ranging from a molecular weight of greater than about 30 Da to a molecular weight of less than about 500 Da. Suitable organosolvents will generally have from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, and typically from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, and will comprise one or more heteroatoms (for example, N, O, S or P), typically no more than 8 heteroatoms.<br>
Suitable organosolvents may comprise hydroxy heteroatoms including, for example and without limitation, lower alkanols of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 hydroxy groups, usually having no more than 1 hydroxy group for every 1.5 carbon atoms. Lower alkanols of interest include, without limitation, any one or any combination selected from ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-propen-3-ol (allyl alcohol), propylene glycol, glycerol, 2-methyl-2-propanol, and the like. In certain examples, ethanol or anhydrous ethanol is used as the organosolvent. In another example, isopropanol is used as the organosolvent.<br>
Suitable organosolvents may comprise amides that may be cyclic and include both N-substituted and unsubstituted amides, where any N-<br>
substituents will usually be alkyls of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more usually1 to 3 carbon atoms. Particular amides of interest include, without limitation, any one or any combination selected from: formamide, methyl formamide, dimethyl formamide, ethyl formamide, diethyl formamide, acetamide, methyl acetamide, dimethyl acetamide, ethyl acetamide, diethyl acetamide. Cyclic amides (lactams) of interest include 2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone. Ureas of interest include tetramethyl urea, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, and the like.<br>
Suitable organosolvents may comprise esters including, without limitation, esters of carboxylic acids as well as esters of inorganic acids. Examples of the former include triacetin, triethyl citrate, ethyl lactate, and the like. Examples of the latter include carbonate esters, where particular carbonate esters include: propylene carbonate, 1,2-butylene carbonate, 2,3-butylene carbonate and the like. Other suitable organosolvents include, for example and without limitation, dimethyl sulfoxide, diethyl sulfoxide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, pyruvic aldehyde dimethylacetal, dimethylisosorbide and the like.<br>
A polymeric coat prepared from a homogenous mixture comprising a water soluble gel forming polymer and a water insoluble organosoluble polymer in a suitable organosolvent, for example, a lower alkanol allows for higher loading and a homogenous polymeric coat and typically allows for a better adhesion of the coat to a core particle compared to most aqueous coating systems. In certain examples, anhydrous ethanol is used as an organosolvent. With selection of an organosolvent such as a lower alkanol or anhydrous ethanol and use of modern coating techniques and explosion proof coating equipment, film coatings from organosols provide rapid, simple, effective coating of the solid dosage form and control over the dosage size, coating disintegration and dissolution rates, and generally results in an attractive, better and desirable dosage coating. Generally, the organosolvents curtailed bacterial and mold growth and surfactants may be optional, but are not required in the organosol polymeric coating composition used in the present invention.<br>
The terms "sustained release", "pulsed release", "delayed release" and "controlled release" are used interchangeably in this application and are defined for purposes of the present invention as the release of an active ingredient from a delivery device at such a rate that when a dose of the active ingredient is administered in the sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release or controlled-release device, concentrations (levels) of the active ingredient are maintained within a desired range but below toxic levels over a selected period of time. In the case of in vivo administration, concentrations (levels) of the active ingredient could be measured in blood or plasma, for example. When administered in vivo the sustained release, pulsed release, delayed release or controlled-release device of the present invention allows for useful plasma concentration of an active ingredient to be maintained for longer than in the case of immediate-release forms.<br>
In certain examples, in vitro dissolution testing shows a controlled release profile of less than 50% of an active ingredient is released in 1 hour, less than 80% is released in 6 hours and greater than 70% is released in 24 hours. In other examples, in vitro dissolution testing shows a controlled release profile of less than 60% of an active ingredient is released in 1 hour, less than 80% is released in 6 hours and greater than 70% is released in 24 hours. In other examples, in vitro dissolution testing shows a controlled release profile of greater than 20% of active ingredient is released in 24 hours. A suitable dissolution test is performed with a USP dissolution apparatus in water until an asymptote is reached and/or 24 hours has elapsed. Dissolution testing may also be performed with a USP dissolution apparatus at a acid media of pH 1 5 for 3 hours and the media being changed to phosphate buffer pH 7.5 until an asymptote is reached or 24 hours has elapsed. Other types of known dissolution tests may also be performed.<br>
In general, the controlled release composition of the present invention do not have a tendency to (i) dose dump when taken under feed conditions, or (ii) produce a burst effect under fasted conditions. The extended release composition of the present invention may mitigate current incidences of<br>
untoward effects such as Gl effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting), dizziness, and headache.<br>
The controlled release profile may be modified on the basis of many factors pertaining to the polymeric coats, for example, without limitation, through the types of polymers used, the order in which they are deposited, the ratios of the polymers in the mix and the nature of their interaction. The controlled-release profile can also be modified by a variety of factors relating to the delivery device and the route of administration as outlined for example, in US Application No. 20070003619, published January 4, 2007. For example, the sustained-release period will vary depending upon the solubility of the active ingredient, the rate of clearance of the active ingredient from the intended site of administration, the size of the core particle, the amount of the active ingredient initially present in the core particle, the presence of other compounds within the core particle that affect the rate of release of the active ingredient, the permeability of the polymeric coating(s) to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and the rate of degradation of the polymeric coating(s), as well as other factors<br>
Release control may be effected or optimized through the types of polymers used, the order in which they are deposited, the number of polymeric coats, the width of polymeric coats, the ratios of the polymers in the mix and the nature of their interaction<br>
There are no specific restrictions as to the methods of manufacture of the composition, device or dosage form of the present invention. Typically, the device can be easily prepared, for instance, by the dry or wet granulation of an active ingredient. Optional components may be added such as, and without being limited thereto, silicone dioxide, one or more excipients, one or more oil components, and/or the like. The granules thus obtained are dried if required and passed through a mill and lubricated.   The granules may be compressed into a shaped form in a rotary tablet press using a conventional method.<br>
In certain examples granules, tablets, capsules, spheroids, pellets, microspheres, nanospheres, microcapsules, or crystals comprising an active<br>
ingredient can be prepared by wet or dry granulation, by extrusion spheronization, by powder or solution layering, by microencapsulation techniques, by milling and compression techniques. Coating may be carried out using fluid bed coating techniques or by coating using perforated side vented pan coating technique or by microencapsulation technique. These methods have been previously taught in the prior art.<br>
In certain examples, different populations of coated particles can be packed together, for example, in a capsule or compressed into a tablet.<br>
Methods of polymeric coating are well known in the art. For example, a core particle may be coated in a fluidized bed or pan, or by spraying or painting a polymeric coat onto a core particle. Another known option is a fluid bed bottom spray coater by having particles suspended in an air stream, and an aqueous dispersion of a polymeric coating composition is sprayed on to the particles. Various conventional coating apparatuses may be employed to facilitate this including, for example, a centrifugal fluidized bed coating apparatus, a pan coating apparatus, or a fluidized bed granulating coating apparatus.<br>
In the preparation of the device, the device may be dryed at a predetermined temperature and relative humidity for a predetermined period of time in order to decrease or increase the rate of release of active ingredients) from the device, A drying process may also be carried out to simply remove a desired amount of solvent from the polymeric coat.<br>
In the processes described herein, it is to be understood that during the coating of a core particle and/or after the core is completely coated, the solvent, for example water or alcohol, may be removed by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as by drying, and the like. As used herein, the term "coating" or "coat" or synonyms thereto includes both the process of applying the coating composition of the present invention to the core and the concomitant removal of the solvent, by techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., drying thereof in which substantially all of a solvent, for example water or alcohol, in the coating composition is removed<br>

By mammal, is meant any member of the class of mammalia that is characterized by being a vertebrate having hair and mammary glands. Examples include, without limitation, dog, cat, rabbit, horse, pig, goat, cow, human being. The delivery device of the present invention may be administered to any animal patient or mammalian patient that is in need of treatment with a site specific, timed, pulsed, chronotherapeutic, extended, or controlled release of an active ingredient. In one example, a delivery device of the present invention is used for treating a horse. In another example, a delivery device of the present invention is used for treating a human being.<br>

The core may be prepared by conventional techniques. The preferred technique is by dry or wet granulation of an active ingredient and excipients such as solubulizing agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, fillers, compression agents, stabilizers, pH altering agents, buffers, lubricants, and glidants.<br>
Fillers, such as lactose, and compression agents such as microcrystalline cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate and glidants such silicone dioxide may, in certain examples, be included in the<br>
core. The core onto which the coating is applied contains the active component. The core may be a tablet, capsule, caplet, pellet, spherical or irregular in shape.<br>
In certain examples, swellable polymeric materials such as hydrogels that swell and expand significantly are not included in the core.<br>
The extended release composition of the present invention can be any suitable size for drug delivery. Typically, the coated core weighs less than about 2 grams; from about 5 mg to about 1000 mg; from about 5 mg to about 500 mg; from about 5 mg to about 100 mg; from about 5 mg to about 30 mg; or from about 20 mg to 30 mg. The coated core may have a diameter of less than about 20 mm; from about 1 mm to about 10 mm; from about 1 mm to about 5 mm; or from about. 2 mm to about 4 mm and a thickness that is less than about 20 mm; from about 1 mm to about 10 mm; from about 1 mm to about 5 mm; or from about 2 mm to about 4 mm. The coated core may be, for example, a tablet, pellet, mini-tablet, capsule and/or caplet. A plurality of coated cores may be combined and encapsulated in a capsule or made into a tablet or caplet.<br>
Excipients may be homogenously mixed with an active ingredient in a core particle. Excipients may be selected from antiadherents, binders, diluents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, compression agents, extrusion agents, pH altering agents, buffers, glidants, lubricants, solubilizers, wetting agents, surfactants, penetration enhancers, pigments, colorants, flavoring agents, sweetners, antioxidants, acidulants, stabilizers, antimicrobial preservatives and binders.<br>
Excipients are biologically inert ingredients which enhance the therapeutic effect. The filler or diluent (eg lactose or sorbitol)is a bulking agent, providing a quantity of material which can accurately be formed into a tablet. The binders and adhesives(eg methyl cellulose or gelatin) hold the ingredients together so that they form a tablet and hold together. Lubricants (eg magnesium stearate or polyethylene glycol) are added to improve powder flow so that the die fills accurately, they also reduce the friction between the<br>
tablet and the machine so that the process progresses smoothly and uniformly.<br>
Antiadherents are used to reduce the adhesion between the powder (granules) and the punch faces and thus prevent tablet sticking to the punches.<br>
Binders hold the ingredients in a tablet together. Binders ensure that tablets and granules can be formed with required mechanical strength. Binders may be selected from starches, sugars, cellulose or modified cellulose such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose, or sugar alcohols like xylitol, sorbitol or maltitol. Solution binders are dissolved in a solvent (for example water or alcohol and used in wet granulation processes. Examples of solution binders are gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, starch, sucrose and polyethylene glycol. Dry binders are added to a powder blend, either after a wet granulation step, or as part of a direct powder compression. Examples of dry binders are cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol. A commonly used binder or compression agent is microcrystalline cellulose. Microcrystalline and powdered cellulose products are sold under the tradenames Avicel.TM. PH (FMC Corporation, Philadelphia, Pa ) and Solka Floc.TM. (Penwest Company, Patterson N.Y.). Microcrystalline cellulose may be used in various techniques such as direct compression, dry granulation, wet granulation, or extrusion-spheronization.<br>
Compression agents are materials that may be compacted. Compression agents may be added to increase the overall hardness of a core particle. Compression agents have inherently high compactibility due to properties of plastic deformation and limited elastic recovery. Non-limiting examples of materials that find use as compression agents are microcrystalline cellulose, silicified microcrystalline cellulose (for example Prosolv™ produced by JRS Pharma), oxidized polyethylene, calcium hydrogen phosphate dehydrate, dextrate, or sugar.<br>
Fillers or diluents are added for bulk to fill out the size of a tablet or capsule, making it practical to produce and convenient for the consumer to<br>
use. Fillers/diluents are typically inert, compatible with the other components of the formulation, non-hygroscopic, soluble, relatively cheap, compactible, and preferably tasteless or pleasant tasting. Plant cellulose (pure plant filler) is a popular filler in tablets or hard gelatin capsules. Dibasic calcium phosphate is another popular tablet filler. A range of vegetable fats and oils can be used in soft gelatin capsules. Other examples of fillers include: lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, and, calcium carbonate. Fillers/diluents are typically selected from microcrystalline cellulose, plant cellulose, calcium phosphate, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitoi, glucitol, ducitol, inositiol, arabinitol; arabitol, galactitol, iditol, allitol, fructose, sorbose, glucose, xylose, trehalose, al lose, dextrose, altrose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, lyxose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, lactulose, fucose, rhamnose, melezitose, maltotriose, and raffinose. Preferred sugars include mannitol, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, trehalose, glucose.<br>
Glidants are used to improve the fiowability of the powder or granules or both. Some examples of glidant(s) are silicon dioxide, starch, calcium silicate, Cabosil, Syloid, and silicon dioxide aerogels. Typically, silicon dioxide is used.<br>
Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and injection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall. Some examples of lubricant(s) are alkali stearates such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, polyethylene glycol, adipic acid, hydrogenated vegetable oils, sodium chloride, sterotex, glycerol monostearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, sodium benzoate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium lauryl sulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate, light mineral oil and the like may be employed. Waxy fatty acid esters, such as glyceryl behenate, sold as "Compritol" products, can be used. Other useful commercial lubricants include "Stear-O-Wet" and "Myvatex TL". Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, glycerol monostearate, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are typically used lubricants.<br>
Sorbents are used for moisture-proofing by limited fluid sorbing (taking up of a liquid or a gas either by adsorption or by absorption) in a dry state.<br>

One skilled in the art can select appropriate excipients for use in the composition of the present invention<br>
The core particle typically will not contain an excipient that is a swellable material such as a hydrogel in amounts that can swell and expand significantly so as to cause rupture or bursting of an organosol polymeric coat(s). Examples of swellable materials include hydrophilic polymers that are lightly cross-linked, such cross-links being formed by covalent or ionic bond, which interact with water and aqueous biological fluids and swell or expand to some equilibrium state. Swellable materials such as hydrogels exhibit the ability to swell in water and retain a significant fraction of water within its structure, and when cross-linked they will not dissolve in the water. Swellable polymers can swell or expand to a very high degree, exhibiting a 2 to 50 fold volume increase. Specific examples of hydrophilic polymeric materials that are typically absent from the core particle or present in amount that do not rupture or burst the organosol polymeric coat include poly(hydroxyalkyl methacrylate), poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone), anionic and cationic hydrogels, polyelectrolyte complexes, poly(vinyl alcohol) having a low acetate residual and cross-linked with glyoxal, formaldehyde, or glutaraldehyde, methyl cellulose cross-linked with dialdehyde, a mixture of cross-linked agar and carboxymethyl cellulose, a water insoluble, water-swellable copolymer produced by forming a dispersion of finely divided copolymer of maleic anhydride with styrene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, or isobutylene cross-linked with from 0.001 to about 0.5 moles of a polyunsaturated cross-linking agent per mole of maleic anhydride in the copolymer, water-swellable polymers of N-vinyl lactams, cross-linked polyethylene oxides, and the like. Other examples of swellable materials include hydrogels exhibiting a cross-linking of 0.05 to 60%, hydrophilic hydrogels known as Carbopol.TM. acidic carboxy polymer, Cyanamer.TM. polyacrylamides, cross-linked water-swellable indene-maleic anhydride polymers, Good-rite.TM. polyacrylic acid, polyethyleneoxide, starch graft copolymers, Aqua-Keeps.TM. acrylate polymer, diester cross-linked polyglucan, and the like. Methods for testing swellable materials with regards to polymer imbibition pressure and hydrogel-<br>
water interface interaction are described in US Patent No. 4,327,725 issued May 4,1982, titled "Osmotic device with hydrogel driving member". In certain examples, swellable polymeric materials such as hydrogels that swell and expand significantly are not included in the core particle. In other examples, the core particle comprises swellable polymeric materials such as hydrogels in amounts that do not result in rupture or bursting of an organosol polymeric coating that is applied directly to the core particle.<br>
In an embodiment, the device is coated with a non-disintegrating and non-semi-permeable coat. Materials useful for forming the non-disintegrating non-semi-permeable coat are ethylcellulose, polymethylmethacrylates, methacrylic acid copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the device is coated with a non-disintegrating semipermeable coat. Materials useful for forming the non-disintegrating semipermeable coat are cellulose esters, cellulose diesters, cellulose triesters, cellulose ethers, cellulose ester-ether, cellulose acylate, cellulose diacylate, cellulose triacylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate. Other suitable polymers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770, 3,916,899, 4,008,719, 4,036,228 and 4,612,008. The most preferred non-disintegrating semipermeable coating material is cellulose acetate comprising an acetyl content of 39.3 to 40.3%, commercially available from Eastman Fine Chemicals.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the non-disintegrating semipermeable or non-disintegrating non-semi-permeable coat can be formed from the above-described polymers and materials that will form pores or channels in the coat. The pore forming agents or channeling agents dissolve on contact with fluid and form passages through which fluid and active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) can move through the coat. The pore forming agent or channeling agent can be a water soluble material or an enteric material. Some general examples of pore forming agents or channeling agents are watersoluble materials such as cellulose ethers, polyethylene glycols or microcrystalline cellulose. Some further examples of pore forming agents or<br>
channeling agents are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example PEG 600, polyvinyl pyrolidone, propylene glycol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methycellulose, hydroxypropyl methycellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl alcohols, methacrylic acid copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
The active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) that are water soluble or that are soluble under intestinal conditions may also be used to create pores in the coat.<br>
The pore forming agent comprises approximately 0 to about 75% of the total weight of the coating, most preferably about 0.5% to about 25% of the total weight of the coating. The pore forming agent dissolves or leaches from the coat to form pores in the coat for the fluid to enter the core and dissolve the active ingredient.<br>
As used herein the term pore includes an aperture, orifice, bore, channel, hole, a discrete area of weakness or as created by soluble or teachable materials.<br>
Polymeric coats may also be formed with commonly known excipients such as plasticizers and anti-tacking agents. Some commonly known plasticizers include adipate, azelate, enzoate, citrate, stearate, isoebucate, sebacate, dibutyl sebacate, triethyl citrate, tri-n-butyl citrate, acetyl tri-n-butyl citrate, citric acid esters, and those described in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 10 (1969), published by John Wiley &amp; Sons. The preferred plasticizers are triacetin, acetylated monoglyceride, grape seed oil, olive oil, sesame oil, acetyltributylcitrate, acetyltriethylcitrate, glycerin sorbitol, diethyloxalate, diethylmalate, diethylfumarate, dibutylsuccinate, diethylmalonate, dioctylphthalate, dibutylsebacate, triethylcitrate, tributylcitrate, glyceroltributyrate, and the like. Depending on the particular plasticizer, amounts of from 0 to about 25%, and preferably about 2% to about 20% of the plasticizer can be used based upon the total weight of the coating polymer. It will be understood that some polymeric coats may be formed<br>
without the use of a plasticizer, for example, without limitation, a polymeric coat of Eudragit NE30D™ (methacrylate copolymer).<br>
An example of an anti tacking agent is talc. Depending on the coating polymer, amounts of from 0 to about 70%, and preferably about 10% to about 50% of talc can be used based upon the total weight of the coating polymer.<br>
Generally, one or more coat layers around a core particle of the device will comprise from about 0.5% to about 70% and preferably about 0.5% to about 50% based on the total weight of the device with the coating. In certain examples, a core particle can be coated with from about 1 wt% to about 50 wt% of a polymeric coating based on the total weight of the coating and the core of the final product. More typically, the coating is from about 1 wt% to about 20 wt%, from about 1 wt% to about 10 wt%, from about 1 wt% to about 7 wt%, from about 3.5 wt% to about 7 wt%, from about 3.5 wt% to about 6 wt%, or from about 4 wt% to about 5 wt%. The coating is typically applied to the core to yield a surface area of less than about 100 mg/cm2. The coating can be one or more layers.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the dosage form of the device may also comprise an effective amount of an active ingredient or an active pharmaceutical ingredient that is available for immediate release as a loading dose. This may be coated onto the coat of the device or it may be incorporated into the coat or it may be press coated into the coated device. The loading dose active ingredient may be the same or different than the active ingredient formulated in the core particle.<br>
In the preparation of coated device, various conventional well known solvents may be used to prepare the device and apply the external coating to the device. In addition, various diluents, excipients, lubricants, dyes, pigments, dispersants etc. which are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1995 Edition may be used in the device.<br>
In certain examples, active pharmaceutical ingredients are present in pharmaceutically effective amounts. An organosol polymeric coating composition is coated onto a core particle comprising the active ingredient in any conventional oral unit dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule, pill, granule<br>
or powder to form the desired preparation. The coating composition coats the core particle utilizing conventional methods known in the art. For example, the coating composition may coat the core in a fluidized bed or pan. Other examples include spraying or painting the composition onto the core particle; or immersing the core particle in the coating composition. Alternatively, the coating composition may be applied to the core particle, e.g., the drug pellets or tablets, in a fluid bed bottom spray coater by having the pellets or tablets suspended in an air stream, and a dispersion of the coating composition is sprayed thereon. Various conventional coating apparatuses may be employed to facilitate this including, for example, a centrifugal fluidized bed coating apparatus, a pan coating apparatus, or a fluidized bed granulating coating apparatus.<br>
In one example, the coating layer is applied to the active core using bottom or top spray coating in a fluid bed coater until the desired coating thickness is obtained. In another example, the coating is applied to the active core using a side vented perforated coating pan. The coating is applied so as to substantially uniformly and rapidly contact and coat the core. It is preferred that the coating composition has substantially an uniform thickness around the core. The coat is applied to the core to yield a weight gain of about 0.1 to 50% and surface area of less than 25 mg per cm squared. The coating composition produces a strong continuous smooth film that adheres to the core.<br>
