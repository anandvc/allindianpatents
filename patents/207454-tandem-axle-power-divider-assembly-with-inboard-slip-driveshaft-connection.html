TANDEM AXLE POWER DIVIDER ASSEMBLY WITH INBOARD SLIP<br>
DRIVESHAFT CONNECTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
,.,001]   This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No, 60/371,074 filed April .9, 2002<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]   This invention relates to tandem axle assemblies and, in particular, to a tandem axle assembly designed to accommodate variations in length along the vehicle driveline during movement of a vehicle,<br>
•v.<br>
2,	Discussion of Related Art<br>
[0003]   A conventional tandem axle assembly includes forward and rear axle assemblies and an intermediate drive shaft assembly connecting the two axle assemblies. The forward and rear axle assemblies each include a pair of axle half shafts extending therefrom on whi.ch one or more, wheels of a vehicle are mounted. Each of the forward and rear axle assemblies further include a differential that allows the vehicle wheels on each axle assembly to rotate at different speeds.  Each of the differentials includes a pinion gear in mesh with a ring gear (which in turn drives a plurality of bevel gears to cause rotation of the axle half shafts). The pinion gears of the forward and rear axle assemblies are driven by c.n  inter-axle differential housed with the forward axle assembly (with the rear axle assembly being driven by the inter-axle differential through the intermediate drive shaft assembly). [0004]   The forward axle assembly of the tandem axle assembly and the vehicle transmission are coupled to opposite end of a vehicle drive shaft assembly-typically through fixed end yokes and universal joints. During movement of the vehicle, movement of the rear axle assembly of the tandem axle assembly and movement of the vehicle suspension cause the length of the driveline extending between the transmission and rear axle assembly to vary.  In conventional vehicles, this variation in length is accommodated by a splined slip<br><br>
connection within the drive shaft assembly. In particular, the drive shaft typically includes a female member having a plurality — splines and a male member having a corresponding plurality of splines and telescoped within the female member. The two members of the drive shaft are thereby able to move axially relative to one another and accommodate variations in the length of the driveline, [0005]  Forming the splined slip connection in the drive shaft assembly is disadvantageous. The drive shaft requires two separate parts and is relatively costly and heavy.  Further the spline slip connection renders balancing of the driveshaft and driveline more difficult and increases runout of the driveshaft. [0006]   The inventors herein have recognized a need for a tandem axle cissembiy that will minimize and/or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
C00071   The present invention provides a tandem axle assembly* [0008]   A tandem axle assembly in accordance with the present invention includes a first axle assembly having a wheel differential and a pinion shaft drivingly coupled to the wheel differential.  The tandem axle assembly further includes a second axle assembly having a wh&amp;el differential and an inter-axle differential configured to divide power between the wheel differentials of the first and second axle assemblies-  A power input shaft is drivingly coupled to the inter-axle differential and an output shaft is driven by the inter-axle differential. A power transmission shaft is coupled to the power input shaft and a drive shaft assembly. The tandem axle assembly further includes an intermediate drive shaft having an output yoke driven by the output shaft and an input yoke drivingly coupled to the pinion shaft,  One member from among the power transmission shaft, the power input shaft, the output shaft, the output yoke, the input yoke, and the pinion shaft defines a bore.<br><br>
&gt;r the power input shaft and the another member may comprise the Other of the power "transmission shaft and. the power input shaft. In mother embodiment of the invention, the one member may comprise the output shaft or the output yoke and the another member may comprise the other of the output shaft and the output yoke.  In yet another smbodiment, the one member may comprise the input yoke or the pinion shaft and the another member may comprise the other of the input yoke and the pinion shaft.<br>
[0009]   A tandem axle assembly in accordance with che present invention is advantageous.  In particular, the inventive assembly eliminates the need for a splined slip connection in the vehicle driveshaft. As a result, the number of parts needed to construct the driveshaft is reduced as well as the cost' and weight of the driveshaft and the time required for assembly.  Further, driveshaft runout is reduced. Finally, elimination of the splined slip connection in the driveshaft improves driveline balance. [001C]   These and other advantages of this invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings illustrating features of this invention by way of example.<br>

[0030]    Intermediate drive shaft 58 transmits power between yokes 54, 55.  Shaft is conventional in the art and is coupled to yokes through universal joints 60, 62.<br>
[0031]   Forward axle asseuibly 16 is provided to drive wheels (not chov.'n) supported on either side of assembly 16 on  axle half shafts (not. shown) extending from axle assembly 16.  Referring to Figure 2, assembly 16 may include a housing 76, a shaft assembly 78 means, such as inter-axle differential 80, for dividing power between assembly 12 and assembly 16, a differential locking device, such as clu:ch 82, a pinion shaft assembly 84, and a differential B6, [00 32]   Housing 76 provides structural support for the other components of assembly 16.

[0053]   A tandem axle assembly 10 in accordance.with the presei invention provides several advantages. In particular, because tl., power transmission shaft 98 and power input shaft 100 of shaft assembly 78 in forward axle assembly IS are axially movable relative to one another, the shaft assembly 78 is able, to accommodate variations in driveline length resulting from movement of rear axle assembly 12 and the vehicle suspension. This function has typically been performed by a splined slip connection in the vehicle drive shaft assembly- Because the function is performed by axle assembly 10, the splined slip connection in the drive shaft assembly may be eliminated.  This results in a reduction in part count in the drive shaft assembly as well as reduced weight, cost, and assembly time for the drive shaft assembly.  Further, criveshaft runout is reduced and driveline balance improved.<br>
[0054]   While the invention has been shown and described with reference to one or more particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.  For example, the male-female relationship illustrated in shafts 98, 100 could be replicated irt other areas of the driveline of tandem axle assembly 10 as discussed hereinbelow, [005!5]   Referring now to Figure 5, a portion of a forward axle assembly 16' for a tandem axle assembly in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Axle assembly 16' is substantially similar to axle assembly 16 of tandem axle assembly 10.  In axle assembly IS', however, the output shaft 105' and the output yoke 54' of intermediate drive shaft assembly 14 have been modified to provide a slip connection,<br>
[00=i6]   Output shaft 106' is again provided to transmit a portion of the power provided by power input shaft 100 to the intermediate drive shaft assembly 14.  Shaft 106' is coaxially disposed relative to power input shaft 100.  In the illustrated embodiment, shaft 106' fcrvns an extension of output gear 104 and is integral therewith. Shaft 106' could alternative be coupled to ear 104 for rotation therewith.  Shaft 106f extends through openings in housing members 90, 92, 94, respectively, and is journalled within an opening of housing member 94 hy  bearings 1301 .  Shaft 106' defines an axially<br><br>
to receive one axial end of yoke 54'. A radially inner surface of shaft 106' may define a plurality of splines 182. [0057]   Yoke 54' is provided to transmit power from output shaft 106' of forward axle assembly 16' to intermediate drive shaft 58. Yoke ' may include an axially extending yoke shaft 184 having a generally circular body. Although shaft 184 is solid in the illustrated embodiment, it should be understood that shaft 184 may be tubular.  A radially outer surface 186 of shaft 184 may define a plurality of splines 183 proximate one axial end configured to mate with splines 182 of output shaft 106'. The spline connection between shaft 106' and yoke 54' allows shaft 106' and yoke 54' to move axially relative to one another. It should be understood, however, that other structural relationships (e.g., a key and^ keywc.y) could be created between shaft 106' and yoke 54' to allow relative axial movement.  Xt should also be understood that the male-female relationship of shaft 106' and yoke 54' may be reversed without departing from the spirit of the present invention.  In other words, yoke 54' could define an axially extending bore having a plurality of splines on a radically inner surface while output shaft 106' could be received within the bore and include a plurality of splines configured to mate with the splines on the yoke 54'-[0058]   A boot 190 acts as a seal between shaft 106' and yoke 54', Soot 190 is coupled to both output shaft 106' and yoke 54' and is disposed about axis 108.  The axial length of boot 190 is variable to callow for relative axial movement between shaft 106' and yoke 54'. AS discussed hereinabove in connection with tandem axle assembly 10, a sliding seal may be used as an alternative to boot 190.<br>
[00359]   Referring now to Figure 6, a portion of a rear axle ass-smbly 12" for a tandem axle assembly in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Axle assembly 12" is substantially similar to axle assembly 12 of tandem axle assembly 10.  In axle assembly 12", however, the pinion shaft 38" and the input yoke 56" of intermediate drive shaft assembly 14 have been modified to provide a slip connection.<br><br>
[0060]   Pinion shaft 38" transmits torque to differential 22, Shaft 33" is disposed about axis 40 and is supported for rotate within openings 42, 44 of bearing cage 32 by bearings 34, 36,  Shaft 38" defines an-axially extending bore 192 that may be closed at one end. Bore 192 is sized to receive one axial end of yoke 56". A radically inner surface of shaft 38" may define a plurality of splines 194..<br>
[00611   Yoke 56" is provided to transmit power from intermediate drive shaft 58 to pinion shaft 3S" of rear axle assembly 12". Yoke 5£"  is configured to rotate about axis 40 extending through pinion shaft 38" and pinion gear 48 in rear axle assembly 12",  Yoke 56" may include an axially extending yoke shaft 196 having a generally circular body. Although shaft 196 is solid in the illustrated embodiment, it should be understood that shaft 196 may be tubular. A radially outer surface 193 of shaft 196 may define a plurality of splines 200 proximate one axial end configured to mate with splines 194 of pinion shaft 38" The spline connection between pinion shaft 3 8" find yoke 56" allows shaft 2S" and yoke 56" to move axially relative to one another, it should be understood, however, that other structural relationships (e.g., a key and keyway) could be created between shaft 38" and yoke 56" to allow relative axial movement.  It should also be understood that the male-female relationship of shaft 38" and yoke 56" may again be reversed without departing from the spirit of the present invention. In other words, yoke 56" could define an axially extending bore having a plurality of splines on a radially inner surface while pinion shaft 3 8" could be received within the bore and include a plurality of splines configured to mate with the splines on the yoke 56'. [O0E2]   A boot 202 again may act as a seal between pinion shaft 38" and yoke 56"'.  Boot 202 is coupled to both pinion shaft 38" and yok«i 56" and is disposed about axis 40. The axial length of boot 202 is variable to allow for relative axial movement between shaft 38" and yoke 56".  As discussed hereinabove in connection with tandem axle assembly 10, a sliding seal may be used as an alternative to boot 202.<br>
[00 63]   As with the slip connection between power transmission shaft 98 and power input shaft 100, the slip connections between<br><br>
output shaft 106' and yoke 54' and between pinion shaft 33" and yoke 56" enable accommodation of variations in driveline length resulting from movement of the rear axl'e assembly and the vehicle suspension. As a result, the splined slip connection in the drive shaft assembly may be eliminated. This results in a reduction in part count in the drive shaft assembly as well as reduced weight, cost, and assembly time for the drive shaft assembly. Further, driveshaft runout is reduced and driveline balance improved.<br>
[0064]   Again, while the invention has been shown and described with reference to one or more particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scop*i of the invention.  For example, although each of the illustrated embodiments of a tandem axle assembly incorporates only one slip connection from among the slip connections shown between shaf'is 93, 100 and between shaft 106' and yoke 54' and between shaft 38" and yoke 56", it should be understood that a tandem axle assembly could be designed to incorporate more than one of the illustrated slip connections at the same time.<br><br><br><br>
