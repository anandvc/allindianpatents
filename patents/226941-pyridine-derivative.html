				<td>Technical Filed<br>
The present invention relates to a novel pyridine derivative or a salt thereof, which inhibits collagen synthesis, and a pharmaceutical containing said compound, which is useful for prophylaxis or treatment of fibrosis. <br>
Background Art<br>
At present, it is said that 130 or more types of diseases exist as diseases referred to as fibrosis, including rare diseases.  Typical disease of fibrosis includes, for example, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, etc.<br>
Pulmonary fibrosis generally refers to syndrome wherein the function of lung is lost because of reconstructed lesion in the alveror region, that is, an alveolar structure is broken by the inflammatory reaction to cause growth of fibroblasts and excess increase in extracellular matrix composed mainly of collagen, resulting in lung sclerosis.<br>
On the other hand, hepatic fibrosis refers to the condition of diseases wherein necrosis of hepatocytes is caused by various hepatopathy such as chronic virus hepatitis, alcoholic hepatopathy, etc. and, thereafter, extracellular mdtrix increases to recruit for the site, resulting in hepatic<br>
fibrogenesis.  The terminal status of this condition of disease leads to liver cirrhosis wherein the whole liver tissue atrophies: and scleroses.<br>
Conventional drugs which inhibit hepatic fibrogenesis described above includes, for example, penicillamine known as a remedy for Wilkinson's disease which occurs due to accumulation of copper in liver as a result of abnormal metabolism of copper, Lufironil which has been studied as a proline hydroxylase inhibitor, etc.<br>
However, these drugs are not sufficient as a drug for preventing hepatic fibrogenesis in view of side effects and validity.  At present, a remedy (or therapy) which is effective for fibrosis represented by hepatic fibrogenesis has not been established, and it has been studied how the process of causing fibrogenesis is specifically inhibited.<br>
As described above, it has been known that an excess increase in extracellular matrix composed mainly of collagen occurs in the process of causing fibrogenesis in lung tissues and hapatocytes.  It has also been known that an increase in extracellular matrix in hepatocytes mainly occurs in a sinusoid wall Disse space and that Ito cells as mesenchymal cells of liver constitute a main production source.<br>
Accordingly, it is important that an excess increase in extracellular matrix (i.e. collagen) is inhibited to inhibit fibrogenesis in liver, lung, etc.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound which is superior in effect of inhibiting production of collagen, and a pharmaceutical containing the same, which is useful for prophylaxis or treatment of fibrosis. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied to solve the problems described above.  As a result, they have obtained such a. knowledge that a pyridine derivative represented by the general formula (1) described below and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are superior in effect of inhibiting collagen production, thus completing the present invention.<br>

The pyridine derivatives (test compounds) obtained in Examples 1-2, 9-10, 21, 25, 29, 33-37, 39, 42, 44 and 46 were subjected to the following collagen synthesis test. [Test for inhibition of collagen synthesis] (Preparation of Plasma Derived Serum (PDS ) )<br>
Plasma obtained by centrifugation of rabbit blood was centrifuged again to remove platelets, and dialysis of the resulting supernatant was carried out against a Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.01% (w/v) calcium chloride and 0.01% (w/v) magnesium chloride.  Then, centrifugation was carried out to remove the residue and the resulting supernatant was immobilized at 56°C for 30 minutes.  The immobilized supernatant was sterilized by using a filter (0.22 Am) to prepare Plasma Derived Serum (PDS). (Method for determination)<br>
Human Ito cells (LI90) were plated in DULBECCO's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured in an incubator in the presence of 5 % carbon dioxide (C02) for 24 hours at 37 °C, and then washed with PBS and cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 2% PDS for additional 3 days.  The cultured cells were washed with PBS and cultured together with the test compounds in MEM containing 10 PM hTGF (transforming growth factor) ß-1 (containing 2% PDS based on the total amount of MEM) for 16 hours.  Then, the cultured L190 was washed with PBS and RI (radioisotope) labeling was carried out in MEM containing ^H proline as a radioactive labeled compound and 0.25 mM ascorbic acid for 24 hours.  This cultured supernatant was precipitated by using trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and then the radioactivity in an acid soluble fraction was measured and<br>
the resulting measured value was taken as collagen synthesis activity.<br>
By comparing the radioactivity in the cultured supernatant containing the test compound with the radioactivity in the cultured supernatant containing no test compound (control), the collagen synthesis inhibition activity (T/C) was calculated by the following equation:<br>
T/C = (radioactivity in cultured supernatant containing test compound)/(radioactivity in cultured supernatant of control).  IC50 was determined as the concentration (µM) at which the collagen systhesis can be inhibited by 50 % (concentration of the test compound wherein IC5Q = T/C corresponds to 0.5).<br>
These test results are shown in Table 1.<br>
