IMPROVED HEAD STRUCTURE OF METER MOVEMENT WITH MOVING COIL<br>
HAVING POINTED PIVOTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to an improved head structure of meter movement, and is especially related to a head of a meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots, wherein the major element, magnet, can be assembled and changed quickly, the head of meter movement is with low cost, convenient for assembling, and the accuracy of product can also be up-graded. The present invention is applicable to head structure of various meter movements.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a conventional head 1 of a mete-r movement with moving coil having pointed pivots comprises: a magnet 10, two magnet protecting sheets 11, a coil set 12 with a pair of pointed pivots, two hair springs 13, a "C" shaped rack 14 and a yoke 15, wherein the two magnet protecting sheets 11 are welded to the magnet 10 and two engaging portions 111, and then these members are welded to the "C" shaped rack 14, the coil set 12 with a pair of pointed pivots frames the magnet protecting sheets 11, it is supported by an upper jewel 17 and a lower jewel 18 connected respectively to the two ends of the "C" shaped rack 14,.the upper and lower jewels 17, 18 are provided respectively thereon with the two hair springs 13, so that an indicating needle 16 of the coil<br><br>
12 with a pair of pointed pivots can restore its original position and the two engaging portions 111 provided on the exterior side of the magnet protecting sheets 11 are used to engage with the magnet protecting sheets 11 in the yoke 15 when assembling.<br>
The above stated conventional head of the meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots has the following defects:<br>
1.	When in assembling, by the fact that the five elements including the magnet, the two magnet protecting sheets and the two engaging portions are combined by welding, therefore the magnet and its accessories shall be plated with copper to form base layers for easy welding, the surfaces of them shall be cleansed after welding for further plating, and then a product can be obtained. This is very cumbersome in product ion.'<br>
2.	In normal processing of a head of a meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots, a raw magnet material is well welded and placed between two magnet protecting sheets before it is magnetized. Because that the internal magnet is unable to discriminate between superiority and inferiority only by apparent observation, when bad quality or other flaws of the magnet are found after a product is obtained by means of welding, the magnet can not be removed for changing, and it can only be wholly discarded. This not only increases the cost of production, but also creates many wastes relatively.<br>
3.	A conventional head of a meter movement with moving coil having<br><br>
pointed pivots adopts the mode of welding. However the magnet thereof is not easy for welding and tends to cause undesired displacement during welding. Because .welding induces the phenomenon of expansion/contraction by heating/cooling, the center of the product tends to deviate, error of accuracy of the head of the meter movement assembled is largely increased, and accuracy of the electric meter will be lowered. Therefore, the present invention is developed to eliminate the above stated defects. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a head of a meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots, which is easy in assembling, can largely reduce cost of production, and can up-grade accuracy.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, the head of the meter movement with moving coil having the pointed pivots of the present invention comprises a magnet set, a coil set with the pointed pivots, a clamping and holding stand, a yoke and a locking terminal piece, wherein the magnet set is composed of two encircling magnet protecting sheets and a magnet.<br>
The coil set with the pointed pivots is wound on a frame. The magnet set forms a gap between itself and the frame when it is mounted in the frame, and the coil set has an indicating needle and the pointed pivots.<br>
â€¢'The clamping and holding stand has two lateral clamping arms<br><br>
for clamping the magnet set between the two clamping arms.<br>
The yoke is formed by lapping of a plurality of yoke laminations. It forms a receiving space therein after lapping. The yoke has receiving positions for placing therei.n the magnet set and the clamping and holding stand. The two lateral sides of the yoke is provided with two locking holes.<br>
The locking terminal piece has two holes on the two ends to position the clamping and holding stand after connecting itself with the yoke.<br>
Thereby, during assembling the magnet set, welding can be saved, the magnet set can be firmly clamped in the clamping and holding stand, and by loosening the clamping and holding stand, the magnet set can be changed at any time.<br>
The preseiit invention will be apparent after reading the detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof in reference to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

Referring firstly to Figs. 2-5, there are shown an embodiment of an improved structure of a head of a meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots of the present invention. The present invention comprises mainly a magnet set 2, a coil set 3 with a pair of pointed pivots, a clamping and holding stand 4, a yoke 5 and a locking terminal piece 6,wherein the magnet set 2 is composed of two magnet protecting sheets 21 encircling a magnet 22.<br>
The coi 1 set 3 with a pair of pointed pivots is wound on a frame 31. The magnet set 2 forms a gap between it and the frame 31 when it is mounted in the frame 31, and the coil set 3 has an indicating needle 7 and the pair of pointed pivots 32, 33.<br>
The clamping and holding stand 4 is in the shape of "U", and has a hole 41 on the bottom. A wire-outgoing end piece 42 is mounted in the hole 41. A jewel 43. is provided on the wi re-outgoing end piece 42 and is used as a fulcrum for supporting the coil set 3 with the pair of pointed pivots. The wire-outgoing end piece 42 is further provided with a restoring<br><br>
hair spring 8, the clamping and holding stand 4 has two lateral clamping arms 44, 45 respectively with guide pieces 441, 451 on' their outer lateral sides and with two mutually spaced engaging blocks 46 on their inner lateral sides for clamping the magnet set 2 between the two clamping arms 44, 45 (as shown in Figs, 3 and 5).<br>
The yoke 5 is formed by lapping of a plurality of yoke laminations 51, forming therein a receiving space 52 after lapping. The yoke 5 has receiving positions 53 for placing therein the magnet set 2 and the clamping and holding stand 4. The yoke 5 is provided on the two lateral sides thereof with two locking holes 54.The receiving positions 53 have two mutually opposite one-way guide channels 531 on the inner wall of the receiving spa,ce 52, so that the clamping and holding stand 4 can be firmly received in the receiving space 52 when the guide pieces 441, 451 on the two clamping arms 44, 45 of the clamping and holding stand 4 are placed in along the two one-way guide channels 531.<br>
The locking terminal piece 6 is a protruding folded strip, having a central hole 61 in corresponding to the central hole 41 on the bottom of the clamping; and holding stand 4. A wire-outgoing end piece 62 is mounted above the hole 61 (for adjusting the indicating needle 7 to return to zero). A jewel 63 is provided inwardly on the wire-outgoing end piece 62 as a fulcrum support ing the coi 1 set 3 with the pair of pointed pivots.<br><br>
The wire-outgoing end piece 62 is further provided with a restoring hair spring 8. The locking terminal piece 6 is provided' on the two lateral ends thereof with two holes 64, so that the position of the clamping and holding stand 4 can be 1 imited when the locking terminal piece 6 is connected to the yoke 5 by the jewel 63 The locking terminal piece 6 is further provided with a stopper 65 to limit the range of rotation of the indicating needle 7.<br>
When assembling, referring again to Figs. 2-4, the magnet set 2 is firstly slipped in the coil set 3 with the pair of pointed pivots, and is clamped and held by the two lateral clamping arms 44, 45 of the clamping and holding stand 4. The magnet set 2 is held between the two engaging blocks 46, then the guide pieces 441, 451 disposed respectively on the outer lateral sides.of the two lateral clamping arms 44, 45 are placed in along the two one-way guide channels 531 provided on the inner wall of the receiving space 52 of the yoke 5. The locking terminal piece 6 is then used to cover and lock the yoke 5. The two jewels 43, 63 support the wire-outgoing end pieces 42, 62 as two fulcrums, and the two pivots of the coil set 3 are connected with the wire-outgoing end pieces 42, 62. With the above stated simple assembling, the head of the meter movement can be assembled very fast. The tips of the clamping and holding stand 4 can partially protrude upwardly so that the ends of the two clamping arms 44, 45 of the clamping and holding stand 4 can abut against the<br><br>
:king terminal piece 6 after the locking terminal piece 6 is inected to the yoke 5. Good fixing function can be obtained, sides, the magnet set 2 is not welded, and thus no situation deviation will occur. The magnet set 2 can be fixed on the amping and holding stand 4 by taking advantage of the present i/ention, and can be firmly received in the yoke 5. Because of s mode of assembling adopted, once the magnet 22 is found ficient, inferior or out of right posi tion, etc. , the magnet t 2 can be taken out at any time and a new magnet set 2 can installed, the proceeding needed is only but to retract the amping and holding stand 4. This is very convenient in oduction.<br>
Thereby the present invention has the following advantages: The present i.nvention uses a clamping and holding stand to get the effect of fixing the magnet set without welding step by step. Its steps of processing are simple. It is convenient for assembling and can save work hours. With its simple structure, it can be firm in use after assembling, and the magnet can be clamped and assured to be located at the center. Thereby accuracy of the product is increased, and its cost of production can be largely reduce^!.<br>
The present invent ion uses the clamping and holding stand to clamp the magnet set thereon, thereby when the magnet set is found deficient in production, it can be dismantled in an inverse direction to have the magnet set changed, this can<br><br>
reduce generation of wastes. In conclusion, the present invention can achieve the expected obj ects and provide an improved head structure of a meter movement with moving coil having pointed pivots, which is applicable in industry. Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to be secured by Letters Patent of the Uni ted States are:<br><br><br><br>
