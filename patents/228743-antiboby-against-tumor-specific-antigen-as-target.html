ANTIBODY AGAINST TUMOR SPECIFIC ANTIGEN AS TARGET<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an antibody useful in cancer treatment, a<br>
pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer characterized in that it contains the<br>
antibody as an active ingredient, a method of detecting cancer and a cancer detection<br>
kit.<br>
Background Art<br>
Tumor cells are known to express antigenic proteins which are intrinsic to the<br>
particular type of tumor cells (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a<br>
"tumor-associated antigens"). Attempts have been made to develop new therapies<br>
for treating tumors by targeting tumor-associated antigens. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
that elicit an antigen-antibody response specific to such tumor-associated antigens<br>
are known to induce various types of in vivo immune responses (antibody-dependent<br>
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),<br>
etc.) to attack cancer cells, thereby inducing cell death. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
useful for tumor treatment have been developed.<br>
However, the range of monoclonal antibodies useful for tumor treatment is<br>
limited. The monoclonal antibodies presently available are capable of treating only<br>
a few types of tumors including metastatic breast cancer, acute leukemic myelosis,<br>
intractable chronic lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.<br>
Development of monoclonal antibodies applicable to treatment of other tumors is<br>
desirable.<br><br>
To obtain a monoclonal antibody useful for tumor treatment, it is necessary to<br>
identify a protein specifically expressed in a tumor cell and obtain a monoclonal<br>
antibody against this protein antigen.<br>
Human oculospanin protein was obtained as an Expressed Sequence Tag<br>
(EST) clone derived from a gene expressed on the retinal pigment epithelium and the<br>
ocular choroidal membrane (Molecular Vision (2002) 8, 25-220). The human<br>
oculospanin gene has an open reading frame of 1068 bp. Human oculospanin<br>
consists of 355 amino acids and is estimated to have a molecular weight of 36.4 kDa<br>
based on the DNA sequence. However, the relationship between human<br>
oculospanin and tumors is still unknown.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
In the specification of the present invention, a compound having a cancer<br>
therapeutic effect is a compound having an activity in suppressing cancer growth<br>
and/or an activity of reducing cancer. In the specification of the present invention,<br>
the terms "cancer" and "tumor" have the same meaning. The term "gene" as used<br>
herein includes not only DNA, but also mRNA thereof, cDNA and cRNA thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the term "human oculospanin gene" as used herein includes DNA,<br>
mRNA, cDNA, and cRNA of the human oculospanin gene. The term<br>
"polynucleotide" as used herein has the same meaning as that of a nucleic acid and<br>
thus includes DNA, RNA, probe, oligonucleotide and primer. The terms<br>
"polypeptide" and "protein" are used indistinguishably herein. The term "RNA<br>
fraction" as used herein refers to a fraction containing RNA. Furthermore, the term<br><br>
"cell" used herein includes a cell within an animal body and a cultured cell. The<br>
term "canceration of a cell" used herein refers to the abnormal proliferation of cells,<br>
which is caused by their lack of sensitivity to contact inhibition and their scaffold<br>
independent-proliferation. A cell exhibiting such abnormal proliferation is referred<br>
to as a "cancer cell". In the specification, a protein having the same function as that<br>
of human oculospanin, such as canceration activity, is also referred to as a "human<br>
oculospanin". Note that the term "oncogene" as used in the present invention<br>
includes a precancerous gene and a proto-oncogene other than the oncogene.<br>
The term "cytotoxicity" used herein refers to a pathological change to a cell<br>
caused by any reason. Therefore, cytotoxicity includes not only externally inflicted<br>
direct damage, but also various structural and functional changes that may occur<br>
within a cell, which include DNA cleavage, dimerization of bases, chromosomal<br>
cleavage, malfunction of cellular mitotic apparatus, and a reduction in enzymatic<br>
activities. The term "cytotoxic activity" used herein refers to any activity that<br>
causes cytotoxicity, as mentioned above.<br>
The term "hybridizes under stringent conditions" refers to hybridization which<br>
is performed at 68°C in a commercially available hybridization solution, namely<br>
ExpressHyb (manufactured by Clontech), or hybridization which is performed at<br>
68°C in the presence of NaCl at 0.7 to 1.0 M using a filter having DNA immobilized<br>
thereon, followed by washing at 68°C with 0.1 to 2X SSC solution (IX SSC solution<br>
contains 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate), resulting in hybridization. The<br>
above term also includes hybridization under conditions equivalent to those above.<br>
1. Human oculospanin<br>
(1) Confirmation of specific expression of the human oculospanin gene<br>
As a result of analyzing expression levels of the human oculospanin gene in<br>
various types of human cells, it was found that the gene is expressed at a<br>
significantly higher expression level in melanocytes compared to other tissues.<br><br>
Furthermore, the present inventors found that the level of expression of the human<br>
oculospanin gene in melanoma is significantly higher than in normal melanocytes.<br>
To explain more specifically, they found the following: when the level of expression<br>
of human oculospanin in melanocytes, lymphoblasts and glia cells, and epithelial<br>
cells is compared, the expression level in melanocytes is found to be significantly<br>
higher. Furthermore, when the level of expression of human oculospanin in normal<br>
skin cells is compared to that in melanoma, the expression level is significantly<br>
higher in the melanoma. From these findings, it can be concluded that human<br>
oculospanin may be involved in canceration of cells and/or in proliferation of cancer<br>
cells. This suggests that the canceration state and/or proliferation state of cancer<br>
cells caused by excessive expression of human oculospanin can be determined by<br>
measuring the level of expression of human oculospanin in individual cells and/or<br>
tissues. An example of such cancer is skin cancer, in particular, melanoma.<br>
However, this finding is applicable to cancers other than skin cancer, provided that<br>
human oculospanin is expressed in the cancer at a significantly higher level than in<br>
other tissues.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame (ORF) of the human<br>
oculospanin gene is represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing and the<br>
amino acid sequence thereof is represented by Sequence ID No. 2. Furthermore,<br>
cDNA of the human oculospanin gene has been registered with GenBank as Homo<br>
sapiens oculospanin (OCSP) mRNA under Accession No. NM_031945. The<br>
cDNA nucleotide sequence registered at GenBank is represented by Sequence ID No.<br>
3 of the sequence listing. The ORF is represented by nucleotide Nos. 65 to 1129 of<br>
Sequence ID No. 3. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of human oculospanin<br>
registered at GenBank is represented by Sequence ID No. 4 of the sequence listing.<br>
A protein comprising an amino acid sequence having one or several amino acids<br>
replaced, deleted from or added to the amino acid sequence of human oculospanin<br><br>
and exhibiting the same biological activity as that of human oculospanin is also<br>
included herein as a human oculospanin.<br>
2. Method of detecting cancer<br>
Human oculospanin, since it is highly expressed in cancer cells, especially,<br>
melanoma, is thought to be involved in canceration of cells, particularly skin cells,<br>
and/or proliferation of cancer cells. The term "specimen" refers to a sample taken<br>
from a test subject or a clinical specimen, and includes samples of tissues, excrement<br>
or the like, such as samples of blood, body fluids, prostate gland, testes, penis,<br>
bladder, kidney, oral cavity, pharynx, lip, tongue, gingival, nasopharynx, esophagus,<br>
stomach, small intestine, large intestine, colon, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, nose,<br>
lung, bone, soft tissue, skin, breast, uterus, ovary, brain, thyroid, lymph node, muscle,<br>
and adipose tissue. In the present invention, skin and lymph node are preferred<br>
tissue samples.<br>
(1) Method of detecting cancer using the level of expression of the human<br>
oculospanin gene.<br>
A method of detecting cancer by using the level of expression of the human<br>
oculospanin gene specifically comprises the following steps 1) to 4):<br>
1)	a step of extracting a total RNA fraction from a specimen taken from a test<br>
subject;<br>
2)	a step of extracting a total RNA fraction from a specimen taken from a<br>
healthy person;<br>
3)	a step of measuring the level of expression of the human oculospanin gene in<br>
the total RNA fractions according to steps 1) and 2); and<br>
4)	a step of analyzing the difference in the level of expression of the gene<br>
between the total RNA fraction derived from steps 1) and 2), measured in step 3) and<br>
thereby detecting cancer of the test subject of step 1).<br>
The individual steps will be explained more specifically as follows.<br><br>
a) Step 1): Extracting a total RNA fraction from a specimen taken from a test<br>
subject.<br>
In extracting the total RNA fraction from a specimen, human tissue is<br>
obtained by an appropriate method satisfying the ethical standards for<br>
experimentation. The tissue obtained is dissolved directly in an RNA extraction<br>
solvent (containing a ribonuclease inhibitor, such as phenol). Alternatively, cells of<br>
the tissue obtained are collected by abrading them using a scraper so as not to break<br>
the cells, or gently extracting them from the tissue using a proteolytic enzyme such<br>
as trypsin, and then immediately subjecting the cells to an RNA extraction step.<br>
Examples of RNA extraction methods that may be used include: guanidine<br>
thiocyanate/cesium chloride ultracentrifugation methods, guanidine thiocyanate/hot<br>
phenol methods, guanidine hydrochloride methods, and acidic guanidine<br>
thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform methods (Chomczynski, P. and Sacci, N., Anal.<br>
Biochem. (1987), 162, 156-159).	Of these, acidic guanidine<br>
thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform methods are particularly suitable. Alternatively, a<br>
commercially available RNA extraction reagent, such as ISOGEN (manufactured by<br>
Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) or TRIZOL reagent (manufactured by Gibco BRL) may be<br>
used in accordance with the protocol provided with the reagent.<br>
From the total RNA fraction obtained, if necessary, it is preferred that mRNA<br>
alone is purified and used. Any suitable purification method can be used. For<br>
example, mRNA can be purified by adsorbing mRNA onto a biotinylated oligo (dT)<br>
probe, attaching the mRNA to paramagnetic particles having streptavidin<br>
immobilized thereon via binding of biotin to streptavidin, washing the particles, and<br>
eluting mRNA.. Alternatively, mRNA may be purified by adsorbing mRNA onto<br>
an oligo (dT) cellulose column and eluting the mRNA therefrom. However, an<br>
mRNA purification step is not essential in methods of the present invention.<br><br>
i) Gene chips<br>
A gene chip may be used on which there is immobilized either an anti-sense<br>
oligonucleotide, which is synthesized based on an EST (expressed sequence tag)<br>
sequence from a database, or an mRNA sequence. Examples of such gene chips<br>
include gene chips manufactured by Affymetrix (Lip Shutz, RJ. et al, Nature Genet.<br>
(1999), 21, supplement, 20-24), but are not limited thereto, and may be prepared<br>
based on any known method. When mRNA derived from a human cell is analyzed,<br>
a gene chip derived from human sequences is preferably used. For example, the<br>
human sequences U95 set or U133 set manufactured by Affymetrix may be used.<br>
However, suitable gene chips are not limited to these and a gene chip derived from,<br>
for example, an animal species closely related to a human may be used.<br>
ii) Arrays or membrane filters on which there is immobilized a cDNA or<br>
RT-PCR product prepared from total human RNA or total RNA, taken from a<br>
specific tissue of a human subject.<br>
The cDNA or RT-PCR product can be a clone obtained by performing a<br>
reverse transcription reaction and PCR using a primer prepared based on a sequence<br>
from a database such as a human EST database. The cDNA or RT-PCR product<br>
may have been selected previously by use of a subtraction method (Diatchenki, L, et<br>
al., Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci, USA (1996) 93, 6025-6030) or a differential display<br>
method (Liang, P, et al, Nucleic Acids Res., (1992) 23, 3685-3690) based on total<br>
RNA in which the expression level differs between a person having a tumor and a<br>
person having no tumor. The array or filter may be one which is commercially<br>
available, such as those provided by IntelliGene (manufactured by Takara Bio).<br>
Alternatively, the cDNA or RT-PCR product may be immobilized using a<br>
commercially available spotter such as GMS417 arrayer (manufactured by Takara<br>
Bio) to make an array or a filter.<br>
(ii) Preparation of a probe and analysis<br><br>
Provided that expression of a desired polynucleotide can be detected, a total RNA<br>
fraction may be used, as can be done in the later steps.<br>
b)	Step 2): Extracting a total RNA fraction from a specimen taken from a<br>
healthy person.<br>
In the present invention, a healthy person means a person who does not have<br>
cancer. The determination as to whether or not a person is healthy can be made by<br>
measuring the concentration of human oculospanin and determining whether or not<br>
the concentration value measured falls within a predetermined range for a healthy<br>
person. Alternatively, the correlation between the expression level of human<br>
oculospanin and the degree of cancer formation can be investigated in advance, and<br>
then, determination of whether or not a test subject is a healthy person can be made<br>
by measuring the expression level of human oculospanin in a specimen taken from<br>
the test subject. The preparation of a total RNA fraction from a healthy person can<br>
be performed in the same manner as described in Step 1) above.<br>
c)	Step 3): Measuring the level of expression of the human oculospanin<br>
gene in a total RNA fraction according to steps 1) and 2).<br>
The level of expression of the human oculospanin gene is represented by the<br>
expression level of a polynucleotide that can hybridize with a polynucleotide which<br>
comprises the nucleotide sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the<br>
sequence listing or a polynucleotide which comprises a nucleotide sequence<br>
complementary to the nucleotide sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the<br>
sequence listing, under stringent conditions.<br>
The expression level of the human oculospanin gene, can be determined using<br>
an immobilized specimen, this and other methods are described below.<br>
(a) Assay using immobilized samples<br>
(i) Immobilized samples<br>
The following are examples of immobilized samples.<br><br>
Not a specific mRNA clone but all of the expressed mRNA are labeled and<br>
used as a labeled probe. Crude mRNA (unpurified) may be used as a starting<br>
material for preparing a probe; however, preferably poly (A)+RNA is used which has<br>
been purified by the aforementioned method. A method of preparing a labeled<br>
probe and a method of detecting and analyzing the probe using various types of<br>
immobilized sample are further described as follows.<br>
i) Gene chip manufactured by Affymetrix<br>
A biotin-labeled cRNA probe is prepared in accordance with the protocol<br>
(Affymetrix's Expression Analysis Technical Manual) provided with the GeneChip<br>
manufactured by Affymetrix. Subsequently, hybridization and analysis is<br>
performed to detect and analyze light emitted from adipic acid using an Affymetrix<br>
analyzer (GeneChip Fluidics Station 400) in accordance with the protocol<br>
(Expression Analysis Technical Manual) provided with the GeneChip manufactured<br>
by Affymetrix.<br>
ii) Array<br>
In order to detect cDNA, a label must be attached to the cDNA when it is<br>
prepared from poly (A)+ RNA using a reverse transcriptase reaction. To obtain<br>
fluorescently labeled cDNA, d-UTP labeled with a fluorescent dye such as Cy3 or<br>
Cy5 may be included in the reaction mixture. If poly(A)+ RNA derived from a<br>
melanoma cell and poly (A)+RNA derived from a cell used as a control are labeled<br>
with different dyes, then both types of poly (A)+RNAs may be used simultaneously<br>
in a mixture. When a commercially available array is used, e.g. an array<br>
manufactured by Takara Bio Co., Ltd. hybridization and washing are performed in<br>
accordance with the protocol provided and then a fluorescent signal is detected using<br>
a fluorescent signal detector (for example, the GMS418 array scanner manufactured<br>
by Takara Bio Co., Ltd.) and thereafter subjected to analysis. The choice of array<br><br>
for use as described herein is not limited to those which are commercially available.<br>
An home-made array and an array specifically prepared in-house may be used.<br>
iii) Membrane filter<br>
When preparing cDNA from poly (A)+ RNA by reverse transcription, a<br>
labeled probe can be prepared by adding a radioisotope (for example, d-CTP) to the<br>
reaction. Hybridization is performed in accordance with customary methods.<br>
More specifically, hybridization can be performed using the Atlas system<br>
(manufactured by Clontech), which is a microarray formed using a commercially<br>
available filter, after hybridization the microarray is washed. Thereafter, detection<br>
and analysis are performed using an analyzer (for example, Atlas Image<br>
manufactured by Clontech).<br>
In any one of the methods i) to iii), a probe derived from human tissue is<br>
hybridized with the immobilized samples of the same lot. The probe which is used<br>
can be charged, but the hybridization conditions used are kept the same. When<br>
fluorescently labeled probes are used, if the probes are labeled with different<br>
fluorescent dyes, then probes of different types can be added simultaneously in the<br>
form of a mixture and hybridized with the immobilized samples. Thereafter,<br>
fluorescent intensity can be read simultaneously (Brown, P.O. et ah, Nature Genet.,<br>
(1999) 21, supplement, p. 33-37).<br>
(b) Other measurement methods<br>
In addition to the measurement methods mentioned above, there are<br>
subtraction cloning methods (see Experimental Medicine, Supplementary Volume,<br>
New Genetic Engineering Handbook, published by Yodosha Co., Ltd. (1996),<br>
p32-35); differential display methods (Basic Biochemical Experimental Method 4,<br>
nucleic acid/gene experiment, II. Applied series, Tokyo Kagakudojin (2001),<br>
pl25-128); and methods using a reporter gene: chloramphenicol acetyltransferase<br>
(such as a pCAT3-Basic vector manufactured by Promega), (3-galactosidase (such as<br><br>
a pPgal-Basic vector manufactured by Promega), secreted alkaline phosphatase (such<br>
as pSEAP2-Basic manufactured by Clontech); or green-fluorescent protein (such as<br>
pEGFP-1 manufactured by Clontech). However, the choice of measurement<br>
method is not limited to these methods.<br>
Step 4) Analyzing the difference in the level of expression of the gene<br>
between the total RNA fraction derived from steps 1) and 2), measured in step 3) and<br>
detecting cancer in a test subject of step 1).<br>
The difference in the level of expression of human oculospanin between a<br>
specimen derived from a healthy person and a specimen derived from a test subject is<br>
analyzed. If a specimen shows a significantly high expression level of human<br>
oculospanin, it is determined that the possibility of having cancer, particularly skin<br>
cancer, and more particularly melanoma, is high, that is, cancer can be detected.<br>
The term "significantly high expression level" refers to the case where, when<br>
analysis is performed by using GeneChip (manufactured by Affymetrix) and<br>
microarray Suite Ver. 3.0 (manufactured by Affymetrix), an average difference value<br>
of a gene derived from a melanoma cell is significantly high compared to that of a<br>
normal melanocyte.<br>
Alternatively, the level of expression of human oculospanin is measured, and<br>
then assessed to determine whether or not the measured concentration value falls<br>
within a predetermined range for a healthy person. If the value exceeds the range,<br>
the subject has cancer. The diagnosis of cancer can be made in this manner.<br>
Otherwise, the correlation between the level of expression of the human oculospanin<br>
gene and the degree of cancer formation in a healthy person is previously<br>
investigated, and then, the expression level of human oculospanin gene of a<br>
specimen taken from the test subject is measured. Also, in this manner, whether or<br>
not a test subject is a healthy person or not can be determined.<br><br>
(3) Method of detecting cancer by using the level of expression of human<br>
oculospanin (protein expression level).<br>
More specifically, a method of detecting cancer using the level of expression<br>
of human oculospanin can be a method including the steps 1) to 3) below.<br>
1)	measuring the level of expression of human oculospanin protein in a specimen<br>
taken from a subject;<br>
2)	measuring the level of expression of the same protein as described in step 1)<br>
in a specimen taken from a healthy person; and,<br>
3)	analyzing the difference between the level of expression of the protein<br>
measured in steps 1) and 2) and thereby detecting that a subject has cancer.<br>
The individual steps are described in more detail as follows:<br>
a) Measuring the expression level of human oculospanin protein in a<br>
specimen taken from a subject.<br>
(i) Preparation of a sample from a specimen for protein measurement.<br>
The specimen is subjected to high-speed centrifugation as necessary to<br>
remove insoluble substances, and then prepared as a sample for ELISA/RIA and<br>
Western blot.<br>
To prepare a sample for ELISA/RIA, skin or lymph node tissue taken from a<br>
subject is used directly, or diluted appropriately in a buffer solution before use. For<br>
Western blotting (electrophoresis), a solution extracted from skin or lymph node<br>
tissue can be used directly as the sample, or diluted appropriately with a buffer<br>
solution, and mixed with a sample buffer solution (manufactured by Sigma)<br>
containing 2-mercaptoethanoI for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For dot<br>
or slot blotting, a solution extracted from skin or lymph node tissue can be used<br>
undiluted or diluted appropriately in a buffer solution, the samples are directly<br>
adsorbed to a membrane using a blotting device.<br>
(b) Immobilization of sample<br><br>
A protein in the sample thus obtained can be specifically detected by<br>
precipitating the protein using a procedure such as immunoprecipitation or ligand<br>
binding, either without additional immobilization or after direct immobilization<br>
thereof. For immobilizing a protein, a membrane used can be one such as is used in<br>
Western blotting, dot blotting or slot blotting. Examples of such membranes<br>
include nitrocellulose membranes (for example, as manufactured by BioRad), nylon<br>
membranes such as Hybond-ECL (manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia), cotton<br>
membranes such as blot absorbent filters (for example, as manufactured by BioRad)<br>
and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (for example, manufactured by<br>
BioRad).<br>
To detect and quantify a protein using an ELISA or RIA method, a sample or<br>
a diluted sample solution (for example, diluted with phosphate buffered saline<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "PBS") containing 0.05% sodium azide) is dispensed into a<br>
96-well plate, such as an Immunoplate, Maxisorp, (manufactured by Nunc) and<br>
incubated without agitation at a temperature in the range of 4°C to room temperature<br>
overnight, or at 37°C for 1 to 3 hours, thereby allowing the protein to adsorb the<br>
bottom surface of the wells to immobilize the protein.<br>
Antibody against human oculospanin can be obtained using a customary<br>
method (see, for example, New Biochemical Experimental Course 1, Protein 1, p.<br>
389-397, 1992), which comprises immunizing an animal with human oculospanin or<br>
a polypeptide arbitrarily selected from the amino acid sequences of human<br>
oculospanin, taking the antibody produced in the body and purifying it.<br>
Alternatively, a monoclonal antibody can be obtained in accordance with a method<br>
well known in the art (for example, Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256, 495-497, 1975,<br>
Kennet, R. ed., Monoclonal Antibody, p.365-367, 1980, Prenum Press, N, Y.), which<br>
comprises fusing an antibody-producing cell producing an antibody against human<br>
oculospanin with a myeloma cell to form a hybridoma cell.<br><br>
Human oculospanin protein for use as an antigen can be obtained by<br>
introducing a human oculospanin gene into a host cell by gene manipulation. To<br>
explain more specifically, human oculospanin protein may be obtained by preparing<br>
a vector capable of expressing the human oculospanin gene, introducing the vector<br>
into the host cell, expressing the gene, and purifying the expressed human<br>
oculospanin protein,<br>
(c) Measurement of the level of expression of human oculospanin.<br>
The level of expression of human oculospanin can be represented by the level<br>
of expression of a protein comprising the amino acid sequence represented by<br>
Sequence ID No. 2 of the sequence listing.<br>
The expression level can be measured by a method known in the art, such as a<br>
Western blotting or a dot/slot blotting method, using anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody.<br>
b)	Step 2: Measuring the expression level of the same protein as described in<br>
step 1 in a specimen taken from a healthy person.<br>
Measurement of the level of expression of human oculospanin in a specimen<br>
taken from a healthy person can be performed in the same manner as described in<br>
step 1) above.<br>
c)	Step 3: Analyzing the difference between the level of expression of the<br>
protein measured in steps 1) and 2) and thereby detecting that a subject has cancer.<br>
The difference in the level of expression of human oculospanin between the<br>
specimens from a healthy person and a test subject is analyzed. As a result, if a<br>
specimen exhibits a significantly high expression level of human oculospanin, it can<br>
be determined that there is a high probability of a subject having cancer, particularly,<br>
skin cancer, and more particularly, melanoma. In this manner, cancer can be<br>
detected.<br><br>
Alternatively, cancer can be detected by measuring the concentration of<br>
human oculospanin and analyzing whether or not the measured concentration value<br>
falls within the predetermined range for a healthy person. In this case, if the<br>
concentration value of a subject is higher than the range for a healthy person, it is<br>
determined that the subject has cancer. Furthermore, by investigating the<br>
correlation between the level of expression of human oculospanin and the degree of<br>
cancer formation in a healthy person, it is possible to determine whether or not a<br>
subject is healthy based on the level of expression of human oculospanin in a<br>
specimen taken from the subject.<br>
3. Investigation of the human oculospanin gene and human oculospanin<br>
The human oculospanin gene and human oculospanin are expressed at a<br>
significantly high level in melanocytes in normal human tissues, and they are,<br>
expressed at a significantly higher level in melanoma than in normal melanocytes.<br>
In a method of examining the function of human oculospanin, full-length<br>
cDNA is first taken from a human cDNA library, derived from cells expressing<br>
human oculospanin, by a known method such as a colony hybridization method.<br>
Then, the full-length cDNA is introduced into a mouse or a human cell,<br>
highly-expressed therein, and assessment is carried out to investigate whether or not<br>
the cDNA affects the cell.<br>
To express cDNA in an animal, a method may be used in which the<br>
full-length cDNA obtained is introduced into a virus vector and the vector is<br>
administered to the animal. Examples of gene transfection using a virus vector<br>
include methods of introducing cDNA by integrating it into a DNA virus or an RNA<br>
virus, such as a retrovirus, adeno virus, adeno-associated virus, herpes virus, vaccinia<br>
virus, pox virus, or polio virus. Of these, methods using retrovirus, adeno virus,<br>
adeno-associated virus and vaccinia virus are preferred.<br><br>
Examples of non-viral gene transfection include administering an expression<br>
plasmid directly into the muscle (DNA vaccination), liposome treatment, lipofection,<br>
micro-injection, calcium phosphate treatment, electroporation and the like. Of these,<br>
DNA vaccination and liposome treatment are preferred.<br>
Furthermore, by transfecting full-length cDNA into cultured cells, such as<br>
muscle cells, liver cells, or adipose cells derived from human, mouse or rat; or into<br>
primary muscle cells, liver cells, adipose cells or skin cells, and expressing the<br>
cDNA therein at a high level, it is possible to examine the functions of a target cell,<br>
more specifically, production and intake of sugars and lipids, control of glycolipid<br>
metabolism such as glycogen accumulation, or to see if there is any effect on the<br>
morphology of a cell. Conversely, by introducing into a cell an antisense nucleic<br>
acid to the mRNA of a gene to be examined, it is possible to examine the effects<br>
produced on the function and morphology of the target cell.<br>
To introduce a full-length cDNA into an animal or a cell, the cDNA is<br>
integrated into a vector containing appropriate promoter sequences and<br>
transformation is carried out to transform the host cell with the vector. The<br>
expression vector for use with a vertebrate cell may have a promoter that is typically<br>
located upstream of the gene to be expressed, an RNA splicing site, a<br>
polyadenylation site, a transcription termination sequence, etc. Furthermore, if<br>
necessary, a replication initiation point may be present. Examples of such an<br>
expression vector include, but are not limited to, pSV2dhfr having an early promoter<br>
of simian virus 40 (SV40) (Subramani, S. et a!., Mol. Cell. Biol., (1981), 1, p854-<br>
864), retrovirus vectors pLNCX, pLNSX, pLXIN, pSIR (manufactured by Clontech),<br>
and cosmid vector pAxCw (manufactured by Takara Bio). These expression vectors<br>
can be integrated into a simian cell, such as a COS cell (Gluzman, Y. Cell (1981), 23,<br>
p.175-182, ATCC: CRL-1650), a dihydrofolic acid reductase defective strain<br>
(Urlaub, G. and Chasin, L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1980),<br><br>
77, p.4126-4220) of a Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO cell, ATCC:CCL-61),<br>
human embryonic kidney derived 293 cell (ATCC: CRL-1573) and the like, by<br>
methods including a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran method (Luthman, H and<br>
Magnusson, G., Nucleic Acids Res. (1983), 11, p.1295-1308), a calcium<br>
phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method (Graham, F.L. and van der Eb, A. J.<br>
Virology (1973), 52, p.456-457), and an electroporation method (Neumann, E. et al,<br>
EMBO J. (1982), 1, p.841-845). However, the integration method and cell are not<br>
limited to those specifically described. In this manner, a desired transformant can<br>
be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, using gene manipulation in a healthy animal, a transgenic<br>
animal can be obtained which highly expresses the desired gene. This can be used<br>
to examine the effects on cell morphology. Alternatively, the state of cells may be<br>
examined by preparing a knockout animal by knocking out the target gene in an<br>
animal having melanoma.<br>
4. Human oculospanin gene and/or human oculospanin detection kit<br>
The human oculospanin gene and/or human oculospanin can be detected<br>
using a kit containing at least one component selected from the group consisting of<br>
materials 1) to 5) below.<br>
1)	an oligonucleotide primer having a continuous sequence of 15 to 30 bases in<br>
length for specifically amplifying a polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide<br>
sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing;<br>
2)	a polynucleotide probe having a continuous sequence of not less than 15<br>
nucleotides capable of hybridizing with a polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide<br>
sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing under stringent<br>
conditions, thereby enabling detection of the polynucleotide;<br><br>
3)	an immobilized specimen to which a polynucleotide comprising the<br>
nucleotide sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing can be<br>
hybridized;<br>
4)	An antibody which specifically binds to a protein comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 2 of the sequence listing, thereby enabling<br>
detection of the protein; and<br>
5)	A secondary antibody capable of binding to an antibody according to section<br>
4) above.<br>
The primer according to section 1) above can be easily constructed based on<br>
the nucleotide sequence of the human oculospanin gene (the nucleotide sequence<br>
represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing) by a customary method,<br>
for example, by a method using commercially available primer construction software<br>
(e.g., Wisconsin GCG package Version 10.2) and subjected to amplification. As an<br>
example of such a primer, more specifically, a primer for amplifying a<br>
polynucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence represented by Sequence ED No.<br>
1 of the sequence listing, use can be made of the combination of an oligonucleotide<br>
comprising the nucleotide sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 5 of the<br>
sequence listing and an oligonucleotide comprising the nucleotide sequence<br>
represented by Sequence ED No. 6 of the sequence listing. The probe according to<br>
section 2) above is a polynucleotide capable of hybridizing specifically with human<br>
oculospanin and being 100 to 1500 bases in length, preferably 300 to 600 bases in<br>
length. These primers and probes may be tagged with an appropriate label (such as<br>
an enzyme label, radioactive label, or fluorescent label) or may have a linker added<br>
thereto.<br>
The immobilized specimen according to section 3) above can be prepared by<br>
immobilizing a probe according to section 2) onto a solid phase such as a glass plate,<br>
a nylon membrane, or the like. A method of preparing such an immobilized<br><br>
specimen is described in Section "2. Method of detecting cancer", Paragraph "(1)<br>
Method of detecting cancer using the level of expression of the human oculospanin<br>
gene, Sub paragraph "(1) Method of using an immobilized specimen". Examples of<br>
immobilized specimens include gene chips, cDNA arrays, oligo-array, and<br>
membrane filters.<br>
A kit according to the present invention may contain a thermostable DNA<br>
polymerase, dNTPs (a mixture of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP) and a buffer<br>
solution. Examples of thermostable DNA polymerases include Taq DNA<br>
polymerase, LA Taq DNA polymerase (manufactured by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.),<br>
Tth DNA polymerase, and Pfu DNA polymerase. The type of buffer solution can<br>
be selected in accordance with the DNA polymerase which is to be used and Mg2+<br>
can be added, as needed.<br>
The antibodies according to sections 4) and 5) above can be prepared by a<br>
method described in Section "2. Method of detecting cancer", Paragraph "(3)<br>
Method of detecting cancer by using the level of expression of human oculospanin<br>
(expression level of protein)" or a method described in Section "5. Preparation of<br>
anti-human oculospanin antibody". The antibody may be tagged with an<br>
appropriate label (such as an enzyme label, radioactive label, or fluorescent label).<br>
A kit according to the present invention can be used for detection of a human<br>
oculospanin gene and/or human oculospanin protein, thereby determining the<br>
presence or absence of cancer and screening for a substance capable of suppressing<br>
cancer growth.<br>
5. Preparation of an anti-human oculospanin antibody<br>
(1) Preparation of antigen.<br>
An antigen for preparing an anti-human oculospanin antibody can be a<br>
polypeptide comprising human oculospanin, a partial amino acid sequence thereof<br><br>
having a partial and continuous amino acid sequence comprising at least 6 bases, or<br>
derivatives thereof having an arbitrary amino acid sequence or a carrier added these.<br>
Human oculospanin protein can be directly purified from human tumor tissues<br>
or cells, synthesized in vitro, or produced in host cells by gene manipulation. More<br>
specifically, in producing human oculospanin by gene manipulation, a human<br>
oculospanin gene is integrated into an expression vector, and thereafter the human<br>
oculospanin is synthesized in a solution containing enzymes, substrates and energy<br>
substances required for its transcription and translation. Alternatively, a<br>
prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell can be transformed with the expression vector and<br>
then human oculospanin can be isolated. The nucleotide sequence of human<br>
oculospanin cDNA is described in: Graeme Wistow, Steven L. Bernstein, M. Keith<br>
Wyatt, Robert N. Fariss, Amita Behal, Jeffrey W. Touchman, Gerard Bouffard, Don<br>
Smith, and Katherine Peterson (2002), Expressed sequence tag analysis of human<br>
RPE/choroids for the NEIBank Project: Over 6000 non-redundant transcripts, novel<br>
genes and splice variants, Molecular Vision 8:205-220, and registered in the<br>
GenBank under Accession No. NM_031945. The ORF of the cDNA is shown in<br>
Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing. The human oculospanin cDNA can be<br>
obtained from a cDNA library expressing human oculospanin by using a primer for<br>
specifically amplifying human oculospanin cDNA from the cDNA library as a<br>
template through a polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter referred to as the "PCR",<br>
(see Saiki, R. K., et ah, (1988), Science 239, 487-49) herein termed a "PCR method".<br>
The in vitro synthesis for a polypeptide can be performed using, for example,<br>
the rapid translation system (RTS) manufactured by Roche Diagnostics; however,<br>
suitable synthesis methods are not limited to this particular method. In the case of<br>
RTS, the desired gene is cloned into an expression vector, under the control of a T7<br>
promoter, and the expression vector is added to an in vitro reaction system.<br>
Consequently, mRNA is first transcribed from template DNA by T7 RNA<br><br>
polymerase and then translation is performed by ribosomes in a solution containing<br>
Escherichia coli lysate. In this manner, a target polypeptide can be synthesized in<br>
the reaction solution (Biochemica, 1, 20-23 (2001), Biochemica, 2, 28-29 (2001)).<br>
Examples of suitable prokaryotic hosts include Escherichia coli and Bacillus <br>
subtilis. To transform a desired gene into these host cells, the host cells are<br>
transformed with a plasmid vector derived from a species compatible with the host,<br>
and containing a replicon, that is, a replication initiation point, and a regulatory<br>
sequence. Furthermore, it is preferred that the vector has a sequence capable of<br>
imparting a selectable phenotype to the cell to be transformed.<br>
As a host cell an Escherichia coli strain, for example, a K12 strain can be<br>
used and pBR322 and pUC series plasmids can generally be used as vectors.<br>
However, the choice of host cell and vector is not limited thereto and any suitable<br>
known strain and vector may be used.<br>
Promoters suitable for use in Escherichia coli, include the tryptophan (trp)<br>
promoter, lactose (lac) promoter, tryptophan lactose (tac) promoter, lipoprotein (lpp)<br>
promoter, and polypeptide chain extension factor Tu (tufB) promoter and the like.<br>
Any one of these promoters may be used for producing the desired polypeptide.<br>
As a host cell, a Bacillus subtilis strain can be used, for example, the 207-25<br>
strain is preferred. The vector pTUB 228 (Ohmura, K. et al, (1984), J. Biochem.<br>
95, 87-93) can be used; however, the choice of Bacillus subtilis host and vector is not<br>
limited to this particular combination. By linking a DNA sequence encoding a<br>
signal peptide sequence for Bacillus subtilis ot-amylase, the protein of interest can be<br>
expressed and secreted from the cell.<br>
Examples of eukaryotic host cells include vertebrate, insect and yeast cells.<br>
Examples of vertebrate cells include, but are not limited to, a simian cell, COS cell<br>
(Gluzman, Y. (1981), Cell 23, 175-182, (ATCC CRL-1650)), mouse fibroblast cell<br>
NIH3T3 (ATCC No. CRL-1658), and a dihydrofolic acid reductase defective strain<br><br>
(Urlaub, G. and Chasin, L. A. (1980), Proa, Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 77, 4126-4220) of<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO cell, (ATCC CCL-61)).<br>
An expression vector for use with a vertebrate cell, can be one having a<br>
promoter located upstream of the gene to be expressed, an RNA splicing site, a<br>
polyadenylation site, and a transcription termination sequence. Furthermore, a<br>
replication initiation site may be present. Examples of the suitable expression<br>
vectors include, but are not limited to, pCDNA3.1 (manufactured by Invitrogen)<br>
having an early promoter of a cytomegalo virus and pSV2dhfr (Subramani, S. et al,<br>
(1981), Mol. Cell. Biol. 1, 854-864) having an SV40 early promoter.<br>
When using a COS cell or NIH3T3 cell as the host cell, suitable expression<br>
vectors have an SV40 replication initiation site, capable of self-proliferating in the<br>
COS cell or NIH3T3 cell and additionally may have a transcription promoter,<br>
transcription termination signal, and RNA splicing site. The expression vector may<br>
be integrated into the COS cell or NIH3T3 cell by DEAE-dextran treatment<br>
(Luthman, H and Magnusson, G. (1983), Nucleic Acids Res. 11, p.1295-1308),<br>
calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation (Graham, F. L. and van der Eb, A. J.<br>
(1973), Virology, 52, p.456-457), electroporation (Neumann, E. et al, (1982),<br>
EMBO J. 1, p.841-845) or others. In this manner, a desired transformant cell can be<br>
obtained. Furthermore, when a CHO cell is used as a host cell, if a vector capable of<br>
expressing a neo gene functioning as an antibiotic G418 resistance marker, such as<br>
pRSVneo (Sambrook, J. et al, (1989): Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual<br>
"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY) or pSV2neo (Southern, P. J., and Berg, P.<br>
(1982), J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, 327-341) is co-transfected with the expression vector,<br>
and then a G418 resistant colony is selected, a transformed cell stably producing the<br>
desired polypeptide can be obtained.<br>
The transformant obtained in the manner mentioned above can be cultured in<br>
accordance with a customary method to obtain the desired polypeptide expressed<br><br>
within the cell or secreted outside the cell and thus present in the culture medium.<br>
As a culture medium, various types of media customarily used can be selected<br>
appropriately depending upon the type of host cell employed. More specifically,<br>
for COS cells, RPMI 1640 medium or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "DMEM") may be used. If necessary, serum components<br>
such as fetal calf serum may be added to the medium.<br>
A recombinant protein produced within a cell or secreted outside a<br>
transformant cell and present in the culture medium can be separated and purified by<br>
various known separation methods on the basis of the physical properties and<br>
chemical properties of the protein. Examples of such separation methods include<br>
treatment with a general protein precipitating agent, ultrafiltration, molecular sieve<br>
chromatography (gel filtration), adsorption chromatography, ion-exchange<br>
chromatography, affinity chromatography, various types of liquid chromatographic<br>
methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dialysis and<br>
combinations of these methods. If a hexa-his tag is fused to the recombination<br>
protein which is expressed, the recombinant protein can be efficiently purified by a<br>
nickel affinity column. If the aforementioned methods are used in combination, a<br>
large amount of a desired polypeptide can be obtained with a high purity and in a<br>
high yield.<br>
(2) Production of anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody<br>
An example of an antibody which specifically binds to human oculospanin, is<br>
a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to human oculospanin. A method<br>
suitable for obtaining such monoclonal antibody is as follows:<br>
To produce the monoclonal antibody, the steps necessary required include:<br>
(a) purifying the biomacromolecule which is to be used as an antigen;<br><br>
(b)	immunizing an animal by injecting the antigen into the animal, taking a blood<br>
sample and checking the antibody titer to determine the time at which the spleen<br>
should be excised, and preparing antibody producing cells;<br>
(c)	preparing bone myeloma cells (hereinafter referred to as "myeloma");<br>
(d)	fusing the antibody-producing cells and the myeloma;<br>
(e)	selecting hybridomas producing a desired antibody;<br>
(f)	segregating (cloning) them into single cell clones;<br>
(g)	optionally, culturing the hybridoma to produce a large amount of monoclonal<br>
antibody or raising an animal having the hybridoma transplanted therein; and<br>
(h) analyzing the physiological activity and binding specificity of the monoclonal<br>
antibody thus produced, or characteristics of the monoclonal antibody as a labeling<br>
agent.<br>
The method of producing a monoclonal antibody is described in more detail<br>
below in accordance with the steps mentioned above. However, methods of<br>
producing monoclonal antibody are not limited to the method described. For<br>
example, an antibody-producing cell other than a spleen cell and myeloma.<br>
(a)	Purification of the antigen<br>
As the antigen, human oculospanin protein prepared according to the<br>
aforementioned method or a part (fragment) thereof can be used. Alternatively, the<br>
antigen used can be a membrane fraction prepared from a recombinant cell<br>
expressing human oculospanin or a recombinant cell expressing human oculospanin,<br>
or a chemically synthesized peptide fragment of a protein according to the present<br>
invention obtained by a method known to those skilled in the art.<br>
(b)	Preparation of an antibody producing cell<br>
An antigen obtained in step (a) is mixed with Freund's complete or incomplete<br>
adjuvant or an auxiliary agent such as potassium aluminum sulfate. The mixture is<br>
used as an immunogen and is injected into an animal. A suitable experimental<br><br>
animal would be an animal known to be suitable for use in a hybridoma preparation<br>
method. Specific examples of such animals include mice, rats, goats, sheep, cows<br>
and horses. However, in view of the availability of myeloma cells which are to be<br>
fused with the antibody-producing cells taken from the animal, mice or rats are<br>
preferred as the animals to be immunized. The choice of strains of mice or rats<br>
used in practice is not particularly limited. Examples of suitable mouse strains<br>
include A, AKR, BALB/c, BDP, BA, CE, C3H, 57BL, C57BR, C57L, DBA, FL<br>
HTH, HTI, LP, NZB, NZW, RF, R III, SJL, SWR, WB, and 129. Examples of rat<br>
strains include Low, Lewis, Spraque, Daweley, ACI, BN, and Fischer. These mice<br>
and rats are available from experimental animal-raising distributors such as Clea<br>
Japan Inc., Charles River Japan Inc., Japan SLC Inc., and The Jackson Laboratories.<br>
In view of fusion compatibility with myeloma cells as discussed later, "BALB/c" as a<br>
mouse line and "Low" as a rat line are particularly preferred as the immunized<br>
animal. In consideration of homology of an antigen between a human and a mouse,<br>
a mouse having a reduced biological function for removing autoantibody, in other<br>
words, a mouse suffering from autoimmune disease is preferably used. Note that a<br>
mouse or a rat which is to be immunized is preferably 5 to 12 weeks old, more<br>
preferably 6 to 8 weeks old.<br>
An animal can be immunized with human oculospanin or a recombinantly<br>
produced version thereof by known methods, such as the methods specifically<br>
described in, for example, Weir, D. M. Handbook of Experimental Immunology Vol.<br>
I. II. III., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford (1987), Kabat, E. A. and Mayer,<br>
M. M., Experimental Immunochemistry, Charles C Thomas Publisher Springfield<br>
Illinois (1964), etc. Of these immunization methods, a method preferably used in<br>
the present invention is, for example, performed as follows. First, an antigen, that is,<br>
a membrane protein fraction, or a cell expressing an antigen, is injected into an<br>
animal intradermally or intraperitoneally. To improve immunization efficiency,<br><br>
both injection methods can be used together. More specifically, when the<br>
intradermal injection is performed in the first half of the injections and the<br>
intraperitoneal injection is performed in the second half of the injections or only the<br>
last time, the immunization efficiency can be particularly increased. The dosing<br>
regimen of the antigen differs depending upon the type and individual differences,<br>
etc. of the animal body to be immunized. However, the antigen is preferably<br>
injected 3 to 6 times at intervals of 2 to 6 weeks, and more preferably 3 to 4 at<br>
intervals of 2 to 4 weeks. It is preferred not to excessively increase the number of<br>
dosings, because then the antigen may be wasted. Also, it is preferred not to overly<br>
extend the length of the dosing interval, because the activity of the cells decreases<br>
due to aging of the animal. The dose of the antigen differs depending upon the type<br>
and individual differences, etc. of the animal body; however, the dose generally falls<br>
within the range of about 0.05 to 5 ml, preferably about 0.1 to 0.5 ml. Booster<br>
immunization is performed 1 to 6 weeks after the antigen is administered, preferably<br>
after 2 to 4 weeks, more preferably after 2 to 3 weeks. If the booster immunization<br>
is performed after more than 6th weeks or within 1 week, the booster immunization<br>
will be less effective. Note that the dose of the antigen to be injected as a booster<br>
differs depending upon the type and size of the animal body; however, for example,<br>
for mice, it generally falls within the range of about 0.05 to 5 ml, preferably about<br>
0.1 to 0.5 ml, and more preferably about 0.1 to 0.2 ml. It is preferable not to<br>
administer an unnecessarily large amount of antigen because then the immunization<br>
effect decreases and it is unfavorable to the animal to be immunized.<br>
One to 10 days, preferably, 2 to 5 days, more preferably 2 to 3 days after the<br>
booster immunization, spleen cells or lymphocytes containing antibody-producing<br>
cells are removed from the immunized animal under aseptic conditions. At this<br>
time, an antibody titer is determined. If an animal having a sufficiently high<br>
antibody titer is used as the supply source for the antibody-producing cells, the<br><br>
efficiency of the following operations can be enhanced. As a method of<br>
determining the antibody titer to be used herein, various types of known technologies<br>
are appropriate, such as RIA methods, ELISA methods, fluorescent antibody<br>
methods, and passive blood cell agglutination reaction methods. In view of<br>
detection sensitivity, speed, accuracy, and the possibility of automatic operation, RIA<br>
methods and ELISA methods are preferred.<br>
The determination of an antibody titer according to the present invention can<br>
be performed by an ELISA method as follows. First, the purified or partially<br>
purified antigen is adsorbed onto a solid surface such as 96-well plate for ELISA.<br>
Then, solid surface having no antigen adsorbed thereon is covered with a protein<br>
unrelated to the antigen, such as bovine serum albumin (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"BSA"). After washing the surface, the surface is brought into contact with a<br>
serially-diluted sample (e.g., mouse serum) serving as a primary antibody, thereby<br>
allowing a monoclonal antibody contained in the sample to bind to the antigen.<br>
Furthermore, a secondary antibody, that is, an enzyme-labeled antibody against a<br>
mouse antibody, is added to bind to the mouse antibody. After washing the<br>
resultant complex, a substrate for the enzyme is added and the change in absorbance,<br>
which occurs due to a colour change induced by degradation of the substrate, is<br>
measured to calculate the antibody titer.<br>
Antibody-producing cells are separated from the spleen cells or lymphocytes<br>
in accordance with known methods (for example, described in Kohler et al, Nature,<br>
256, 495, 1975; Kohler et al, Eur J. Immunol., 6, 511, 1977; Milstein et al, Nature,<br>
266, 550, 1977; Walsh, Nature, 266, 495, 1977). More specifically, in the case of<br>
spleen cells, the antibody-producing cells can be separated by a general method<br>
which comprises homogenizing tissue, filtering the homogenized through a stainless<br>
steel mesh, and suspending the cells obtained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium<br>
(MEM).<br><br>
(c)	Preparation of bone myeloma cells (hereinafter referred to as "myeloma")<br>
The choice of myeloma cells which are to be used for cell fusion is not particularly<br>
limited and suitable cells can be selected from known cell strains. For convenience<br>
when hybridoma are selected from fused cells, it is preferable to use a HGPRT<br>
(Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) defective strain whose selection<br>
procedure has been established. More specifically, examples of HGPRT defective<br>
strains include X63-Ag8(X63), NSI-Ag4/l(NSl), P3X63-Ag8.Ul(P3Ul),<br>
X63-Ag8.653(X63.653), P2/0-Agl4(SP2/0), MPC11-45.6TG1.7(45.6TG), FO,<br>
S149/5XXO and BU.l derived from mice, 210.RSY3.Ag.l.2.3 (Y3) derived from<br>
rat; and U266AR(SKO-007), GM1500-GTG-A12(GM1500), UC729-6,<br>
LICR-LOW-HMy2(HMy2), and 8226AR/NIP4-1(NP41) derived from humans.<br>
These HGPRT defective strains are available from the American Type Culture<br>
Collection (ATCC), etc.<br>
These strains are subcultured in an appropriate medium such as 8-azaguanine<br>
medium [RPMI-1640 supplemented with glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanbl, gentamicin,<br>
and fetal calf serum (hereinafter referred to as "FCS") and further 8-azaguanine is<br>
added thereto]; Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"IMDM"), or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"DMEM"). In this case, 3 to 4 days before performing the cell fusion operation, the<br>
cells are transferred to a regular medium [for example, ASF 104 medium<br>
(manufactured by Ajinomoto Co. Inc.) containing 10% FCS] and subcultured therein<br>
to obtain not less than 2 x 107 cells by the day of cell fusion.<br>
(d)	Cell fusion<br>
Fusion between antibody-producing cells and myeloma cells is appropriately<br>
performed in accordance with known methods (including: Weir, D. M. Handbook of<br>
Experimental Immunology Vol. I. II. III., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford<br>
(1987), Kabat, E. A., and Mayer, M.M. Experimental Immunochemistry, Charles C<br><br>
Thomas Publisher, Springfield, Illinois (1964)), under conditions such that the<br>
survival rate of cells is not excessively reduced. Examples of such methods include<br>
chemical methods in which antibody-producing cells and myeloma cells are mixed in<br>
a high concentration polymer solution, for example, polyethylene glycol; and<br>
physical methods using electric stimulation. Of these methods, the chemical<br>
method is more specifically explained as follows. When polyethylene glycol is<br>
used as the high concentration polymer solution, antibody-producing cells and<br>
myeloma cells are mixed in a solution of polyethylene glycol having a molecular<br>
weight of 1,500 to 6,000, more preferably, 2,000 to 4,000, at a temperature of 30 to<br>
40°C, preferably 35 to 38°C, for 1 to 10 minutes, more preferably 5 to 8 minutes.<br>
(e)	Selection of hybridoma populations<br>
The method of selecting hybridoma obtained by cell fusion is not particularly<br>
restricted. Usually, use is made of the HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin,<br>
thymidine) selection method [Kohler et al, Nature, 256, 495 (1975); Milstein at al.,<br>
Nature 266, 550 (1977)]. This is an effective method when hybridoma are obtained<br>
using myeloma cells of a HGPRT defective strain incapable of surviving in the<br>
presence of aminopterin. More specifically, by culturing unfused cells and<br>
hybridoma in HAT medium, only hybridoma having aminopterin resistance are<br>
selected and allowed to remain and proliferate.<br>
(f)	Segregation to single cell clone (Cloning)<br>
As a cloning method for hybridoma, known methods such as a<br>
methylcellulose method, soft agarose method, or limiting dilution method can be<br>
used [see, for example, Barbara, B.M. and Stanley, M.S.: Selected Methods in<br>
Cellular Immunology, W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco (1980)].<br>
Examples of a cloning method include a limiting dilution method in which<br>
hybridoma cells are diluted so as to contain a single hybridoma cell per well of a<br>
plate and cultured; a soft agarose method in which hybridoma cells are cultured in a<br><br>
soft agarose medium and colonies are recovered; a method of taking individual<br>
hybridoma cells by means of a micro manipulator and culturing them; and a so-called<br>
"clone sorter method" in which hybridoma cells are separated one by one by means<br>
of a cell sorter. Of these methods, the limiting dilution method is preferred. In<br>
this method, a fibroblast cell strain derived from a rat fetus or feeder cells such as<br>
healthy mouse spleen cells, thymus gland cells, or ascites cells are seeded.<br>
Hybridoma cells are diluted in medium to provide a dilution ratio of 0.2 to 0.5 cells<br>
per 0.2 ml. The diluted hybridoma suspension solution is transferred into wells to<br>
provide 0.1 ml per well and continuously cultured for about 2 weeks with changes of<br>
about 1/3 of the medium with fresh medium at predetermined time intervals (for<br>
example, every 3 days). In this manner, hybridoma clones can be proliferated.<br>
The hybridoma cells in the well for which antibody titer has been confirmed<br>
are subjected to repeat cloning by the limiting dilution method, 2 to 4 times.<br>
Hybridoma cells, with an antibody titer which is confirmed to be stable, are selected<br>
as anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma strains. One<br>
of the cloned hybridoma strains thus obtained is designated as "03B8-2C9-4F3" and<br>
this has been deposited at the International Patent Organism Depositary of the<br>
National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science Technology (located at Tsukuba<br>
Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) as of February 17, 2004 under<br>
deposition No. FERM BP-08627.<br>
(g) Preparation of monoclonal antibody by culturing hybridoma cells.<br>
The hybridoma cells thus selected are cultured to efficiently obtain<br>
monoclonal antibody. However, prior to culturing, it is desirable that a hybridoma<br>
cell producing a desired monoclonal antibody is screened. The screening is<br>
performed by a known method.<br>
The determination of antibody titer can be performed in the present invention<br>
by, for example, an ELISA method in accordance with the following procedure.<br><br>
First, purified or partially purified human oculospanin or cells expressing human<br>
oculospanin are adsorbed onto a solid surface of a 96-well plate for ELISA. Then,<br>
the solid surface having no antigen adsorbed thereon is covered with a protein<br>
unrelated to the antigen, for example, bovine serum albumin (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "BSA"). After washing the surface, the surface is brought into contact with a<br>
serially-diluted sample (for example, mouse serum) as a first antibody, thereby<br>
allowing binding of an anti-human oculospanin antibody in the sample to the antigen.<br>
Furthermore, an antibody against the mouse antibody and labeled with an enzyme,<br>
serving as a secondary antibody, is added to bind to the mouse antibody. After<br>
washing the resultant complex, a substrate for the enzyme is added and the change of<br>
absorbance, which occurs due to the colour change induced by degradation of the<br>
substrate, is determined to calculate the antibody titer. In this way, the antibody titer<br>
is calculated. Note that such a screening operation can be performed after or before<br>
cloning of the hybridoma cell as mentioned above.<br>
A hybridoma obtained by the aforementioned method can be stored in a<br>
frozen state in liquid nitrogen or in a refrigerator at 80°C or less.<br>
After completion of cloning, hybridoma are transferred from HAT medium to<br>
a general medium and cultured. Large-scale culture is performed by rotation culture<br>
using a large culture bottle or by spinner culture. The supernatant obtained from the<br>
large-scale culture is purified by a known method to those skilled in the art, such as<br>
gel filtration, to obtain a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to a protein<br>
according to the present invention. The hybridoma can be injected into the<br>
abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same line as the hybridoma (for example,<br>
BALB/c) or a Nu/Nu mouse to proliferate the hybridoma. In this way, ascites fluid<br>
containing a large amount of the monoclonal antibody according to the present<br>
invention can be obtained. When hybridoma cells are injected into the abdominal<br>
cavity, if a mineral oil such as 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl pentadecane (pristine) has (3 to<br><br>
7 days before) been administered previously, the ascites fluid can be obtained in a<br>
larger amount. To explain more specifically, an immunosuppressive agent is<br>
previously injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse of the same strain as the<br>
hybridoma. Twenty days after inactivation of the T cells, 106 to 107 of hybridoma<br>
clone cells are suspended in a serum-free medium (0.5 ml) and the suspension is<br>
injected into the abdominal cavity. When the abdomen is expanded and filled with<br>
the ascites fluid, the ascites fluid is taken. By virtue of this method, the monoclonal<br>
antibody can be obtained at a concentration 100-fold higher than that of the culture<br>
medium.<br>
A monoclonal antibody obtained in the aforementioned method can be<br>
purified by the methods described in, for example, Weir, D.M.: Handbook of<br>
Experimental Immunology Vol. I, II, III, Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford<br>
(1978). To explain more specifically, examples of such methods include<br>
ammonium sulfate precipitation methods, gel-filtration methods, ion exchange<br>
chromatographic methods, and affinity chromatographic methods. Of these, the<br>
ammonium sulfate precipitation method, if it is repeated 3 to 4 times, preferably 3 to<br>
6 times, successfully purifies the monoclonal antibody. However, in this method,<br>
the yield of the purified monoclonal antibody is extremely low. Therefore, the<br>
monoclonal antibody is crudely purified by performing the ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation method once or twice and then subjected to at least one method, and<br>
preferably two methods, selected from gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography,<br>
and affinity chromatography and the like. In this way, highly purified monoclonal<br>
antibody can be obtained in a high yield. The ammonium sulfate precipitation<br>
method may be performed in the following combination and in the following order:<br>
a) ammonium sulfate precipitation method - ion exchange chromatographic<br>
method-gel filtration method; b) ammonium sulfate precipitation method - ion<br>
exchange chromatographic method - affinity chromatographic method; and c)<br><br>
ammonium sulfate precipitation method - gel filtration method - affinity<br>
chromatographic method, etc. Of these combinations, to obtain the monoclonal<br>
antibody with a high purity in a high yield, combination c) is particularly preferable.<br>
As a simple purification method, a commercially available antibody<br>
purification kit (for example, MAbTrap Gil kit manufactured by Pharmacia) and the<br>
like can be used.<br>
The monoclonal antibody thus obtained has high antigen specificity for<br>
human oculospanin.<br>
(h) Analysis of monoclonal antibody<br>
The monoclonal antibody thus obtained is checked for isotype and subclass<br>
thereof as follows. Suitable identification methods include the Ouchterlony method,<br>
ELISA methods and RIA methods. The Ouchterlony method is simple; although, if<br>
monoclonal antibody is obtained at low concentration it must be concentrated.<br>
Alternatively, when an ELISA method or RIA method is used, the culture<br>
supernatant can be directly reacted with an antigen adsorption solid phase. In<br>
addition, if various types of antibodies corresponding to immunoglobulin isotypes<br>
and subclasses are used as secondary antibodies, the isotype and subclass of the<br>
monoclonal antibody can be identified. As a further simple method, a<br>
commercially available identification kit (for example, Mouse Typer kit<br>
manufactured by BioRad) and the like can be used.<br>
The quantification of a protein can be performed by the Folin Lowry assay<br>
based on the adsorption at 280 nm [1.4 (OD280) = Immunoglobulin 1 mg/ml].<br>
(3) Preparation of humanized anti-human oculospanin antibody<br>
Immunoglobulin G (hereinafter simply referred to as "IgG") consists of two<br>
light polypeptide chains (hereinafter referred to as "light chains") each having a<br>
molecular weight of about 23,000 and two heavy chains (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"heavy chains") each having a molecular weight of about 50,000. Each of the<br><br>
heavy chains and light chains has a repeat structure, in which an amino acid sequence<br>
formed of about 110 residues are conserved, this constitutes a basic unit (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "domain") of the three dimensional structure of IgG. The heavy<br>
chain and light chain constitute 4 and 2 independent continuous domains,<br>
respectively. In both the heavy chain and the light chain, the variation in the amino<br>
terminal domain between different antibodies is greater than the variation in the other<br>
domains. This domain is called a variable domain (hereinafter referred to as a "V<br>
domain"). At the amino terminus of IgG, the V domains of the heavy chain and<br>
light chain are complementarily associated to form a variable region. In contrast,<br>
the remaining domains constitute a constant domain. The constant domain has a<br>
sequence intrinsic to each animal species. For example, the constant region of<br>
mouse IgG differs from that of human IgG. Therefore, mouse IgG is recognized as<br>
a foreign substance by the human immune system. As a result, a human anti-mouse<br>
antibody response (hereinafter referred to as "HAMA") is raised (see Schroff et al,<br>
Cancer Res., 45, 879-85 (1985). Because of this, mouse antibody cannot be<br>
administered repeatedly to a human subject. To administer such an antibody to a<br>
human, it is necessary to modify the antibody molecules so as not to cause the<br>
HAMA response whilst maintaining the specificity of the antibody.<br>
According to the results of X-ray crystallography, a domain has a longitudinal<br>
cylindrical structure in which two layers of antiparallel p-sheets each formed of 3 to<br>
5 (3 chains are superposed. In the variable region, three loops are gathered for each<br>
of the V domains of the heavy chain and light chain to form an antigen-binding site.<br>
Each of the loops is referred to as a complementarity-determining region (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "CDR"), in which the variation in the amino acid sequence is most<br>
significant. The portions other than the CDRs of the variable region generally play<br>
a role in supporting the structure of the CDR, and are thus called the "framework".<br>
Kabat et al. collected numerous primary sequences of the variable regions of heavy<br><br>
chains and light chains. Based on the degree of conservation of the sequences, they<br>
classified individual primary sequences into the CDR and the framework and made a<br>
list thereof (see SEQUENCES OF IMMUNOLOGICAL INTEREST, 5th edition,<br>
NIH publication, No. 91-3242, E.A. Kabat et al). Furthermore, the frameworks are<br>
classified into a plurality of subgroups based on common features of the amino acid<br>
sequences. Furthermore, it was found that there is a corresponding framework<br>
between a human and a mouse.<br>
From studies of the structural features of IgG, a method of preparing a<br>
humanized antibody has been conceived as described below.<br>
Initially, a chimeric antibody was proposed in which the variable region of an<br>
antibody derived from a mouse is connected to a constant region derived from a<br>
human (see Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6851-6855, (1984)). However, such a<br>
chimeric antibody still contains many non-human amino acid residues. Therefore,<br>
when the chimeric antibody is administered over a long period of time, a HAMA<br>
response may possibly be induced (see Begent et al., Br. J. Cancer, 62, 487, (1990)).<br>
As a method for further reducing the amino acid residues derived from a<br>
non-human mammalian source, which may possibly cause a HAMA response in<br>
humans, a method of integrating only the CDR portion into a human-derived<br>
antibody was proposed (see Nature, 321, 522-525, (1986)). However, to maintain<br>
immunoglobulin activity against an antigen, transplantation of the CDR alone was<br>
generally insufficient.<br>
Chothia et al, found the following based on data obtained by X-ray<br>
crystallography in 1987:<br>
(i) in the amino acid sequence of the CDR, there is a site which binds directly to an<br>
antigen and a site responsible for maintaining the structure of the CDR itself, and the<br>
three dimensional structures of the CDR that can be adopted are classified into a<br>
plurality of typical patterns (canonical structures); and<br><br>
(ii) the classes of canonical structures are determined not only by the CDR, but also<br>
by the type of amino acid present in a specific site of the framework portion (see J.<br>
Mol. Biol., 196, 901-917, (1987)).<br>
Based on these findings, it was suggested that when the CDR transplantation<br>
method is employed, amino acid residues of a part of the framework must be<br>
transplanted into a human antibody in addition to the sequence of the CDR (see<br>
Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No. 4-502408).<br>
Generally, a non-human mammalian-derived antibody from which the CDR is<br>
to be transplanted is defined as a "donor", whereas the human antibody into which<br>
the CDR is transplanted is defined as an "acceptor". The present invention follows<br>
these definitions.<br>
A point which should be considered in carrying out the CDR transplantation<br>
is that the activity of the immunoglobulin molecule is maintained by preserving the<br>
CDR structure as much as possible. To achieve this, attention must be paid to the<br>
following two points:<br>
(i) which subgroup of antibodies the acceptor is selected from; and<br>
(ii) which amino acid residue is selected from the framework of the donor.<br>
Queen et al. proposed a design method for transplanting an amino acid<br>
residue into an acceptor together with the CDR sequence when the amino acid<br>
residue of the framework of the donor corresponds to at least one of the following<br>
references (see Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No.<br>
4-502408).<br>
(a)	the amino acid is rarely present at the position within the framework of an<br>
acceptor, whereas the corresponding amino acid of a donor is usually present at the<br>
equivalent position;<br>
(b)	the amino acid is present near one of the CDRs; and<br><br>
(c) it is predicted that the amino acid has a side chain atom within about 3<br>
angstroms from the CDR in its three dimensional immunoglobulin model and that<br>
the side main atom can interact with an antigen or the CDR of a humanized antibody.<br>
DNA encoding a heavy chain or light chain of the anti human oculospanin<br>
monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be obtained by preparing mRNA<br>
from a hybridoma cell producing the anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody,<br>
converting the mRNA into cDNA using reverse transcriptase, and isolating each<br>
DNA encoding the heavy chain or light chain of the antibody.<br>
In extracting mRNA, the guanidine thiocyanate - hot phenol method, and<br>
guanidine thiocyanate guanidine - hydrochloride method may be employed; however,<br>
the guanidine thiocyanate cesium chloride method is also suitable. Preparation of<br>
mRNA from a cell is performed by first preparing total RNA and purifying the<br>
mRNA using a poly(a)+ RNA purification carrier such as oligo (dT) cellulose or<br>
oligo (dT) latex beads or directly purifying mRNA from a cell lysate by use of the<br>
carrier. For preparing total RNA, use may be made of the alkaline sucrose<br>
density-gradient centrifugation method [see Dougherty, W. G. and Hiebert, E. (1980)<br>
Virology 101, 466-474], the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol method, the guanidine<br>
thiocyanate-trifluoro-cesium method, and the phenol SDS method and the like;<br>
however, the method using guanidine thiocyanate and cesium chloride is also<br>
suitable [see Chirgwin, J. M., etal. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 5294-5299].<br>
After a single-stranded cDNA is synthesized by a reverse transcriptase<br>
reaction using the poly(a)+ RNA obtained as mentioned above as a template,<br>
double-stranded cDNA can be synthesized from the single-stranded cDNA. This<br>
method may be the SI nuclease method [see Efstratiadis, A., et al. (1976) Cell, 7,<br>
279-288], the Gubler/Hoffmann method [see Gubler, U. and Hoffman, B. J. (1983)<br>
Gene 25, 263-269], the Okayama/Berg method [see Okayama, H. and Berg, P.<br>
(1982) Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 161-170] or others; however, suitably used in the present<br><br>
invention is the so-called RT-PCR method in which a polymerase chain reaction<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a "PCR") [see Saiki, R. K., et al. (1988) Science 239,<br>
487-49] is performed using a single-stranded cDNA as a template.<br>
The double-stranded cDNA thus obtained is integrated into a cloning vector to<br>
obtain a recombinant vector, which is then introduced into a microorganism, such as<br>
Escherichia coli, to form a transformant. The transformant can be selected by using<br>
tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance as a marker. Escherichia coli can be<br>
transformed by the Hanahan method [see Hanahan, D. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 166,<br>
557-580], more specifically, by preparing a competent cell in the presence of calcium<br>
chloride, magnesium chloride or rubidium chloride, and adding the recombinant<br>
DNA vector to the competent cell. Note that when a plasmid is used as a vector, the<br>
plasmid must have any one of the drug resistance genes as mentioned above.<br>
Needless to say, a cloning vector other than a plasmid, such as a lambda group phage,<br>
may be used.<br>
As a method of selecting a strain having a cDNA, which encodes each of the<br>
subunits of a desired anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody from the<br>
transformant strain obtained above, any of the methods described below can be<br>
employed. When a desired cDNA is specifically amplified by the RT-PCR method,<br>
such operation of the method can be skipped.<br>
(a) Method using a polymerase chain reaction<br>
When the amino acid sequence of a desired protein has been elucidated in its<br>
entirety or in part, oligonucleotide primers of a sense strand and an antisense strand<br>
corresponding to a part of the amino acid sequence are synthesized. Then, the<br>
polymerase chain reaction [Saiki, R. K., et al. (1988) Science 239, 487-49] is<br>
performed by using these primers in combination to amplify a DNA fragment<br>
encoding heavy chain and light chain subunits of a desired anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody. As the template DNA used herein, use may be made of cDNA<br><br>
synthesized from mRNA of a hybridoma producing the anti-human oculospanin<br>
monoclonal antibody by a reverse transcriptase reaction.<br>
The DNA fragment thus prepared can be directly integrated into a plasmid<br>
vector by use of a commercially available kit, etc. Alternatively, the DNA fragment<br>
may be used for selecting a desired clone by labeling the fragment with 32P, 35S, or<br>
biotin, and performing colony hybridization or plaque hybridization by using it as a<br>
probe.<br>
For example, a method of examining a partial amino acid sequence of each<br>
subunit of the anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody of the present invention<br>
is preferably performed by isolating each subunit by use of a known method such as<br>
electrophoresis or column chromatography and then analyzing the N-terminal amino<br>
acid sequence of each subunit using an automatic protein sequencer (for example,<br>
PPSQ-10, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation).<br>
A method of isolating cDNA encoding each subunit of the anti-human<br>
oculospanin monoclonal antibody protein from the desired transformant obtained as<br>
mentioned above is performed in accordance with a known method [see Maniatis, T.,<br>
et al. (1982) in "Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual" Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory, NY.], and more specifically, can be performed by separating fractions<br>
corresponding to vector DNA from a cell and excising a DNA region encoding a<br>
desired subunit from the vector DNA (plasmid DNA).<br>
(b) Screening method using a synthesized oligonucleotide probe<br>
When the whole or part of the amino acid sequence of a desired protein is<br>
elucidated (any sequence is taken from any region of the desired protein as long as it<br>
is a specific sequence having a plurality of contiguous amino acids), an<br>
oligonucleotide is synthesized (in this case, use may be made of either a nucleotide<br>
sequence presumed based on the degree of frequency of codons in use or a plurality<br>
of nucleotide sequences of conceivable nucleotide sequences in combination; in the<br><br>
latter case, the number of types of nucleotide sequences can be reduced by<br>
integrating inosine) so as to correspond to the amino acid sequence, used as a probe<br>
(labeled with 32P, 35S or biotin); hybridized with a nitrocellulose filter on which the<br>
DNA of a transformant strain is denatured and immobilized, and then the positive<br>
strain obtained is isolated.<br>
The sequence of the DNA thus obtained can be determined by the Maxam -<br>
Gilbert chemical modification method [see Maxam, A. M. and Gilbert, W. (1980) in<br>
"Methods in Enzymology" 65, 499-576] and the dideoxynucleotide chain termination<br>
method [Messing, J. and Vieira, J. (1982) Gene 19, 269-276].<br>
Recently, an automatic base sequence determination system using a<br>
fluorescent dye has been widely used (for example, sequence robots "CATALYST<br>
800" and model 373ADNA sequencer, etc. manufactured by PerkinElmer Japan Co.,<br>
Ltd.)<br>
Using such a system also makes it possible to efficiently and safely determine<br>
a DNA nucleotide sequence. Based on the data of the present invention thus<br>
determined including the nucleotide sequence of DNA and the N-terminal amino<br>
acid sequences of the heavy chain and light chain, it is possible to determine the<br>
entire amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and light chain of the monoclonal<br>
antibody of the present invention.<br>
The heavy chain and light chain of immunoglobulin each constitute a variable<br>
region and a constant region. The variable region further constitutes<br>
complementarity-determining regions (hereinafter referred to as "CDR", there are 3<br>
sites in each of the heavy chain and light chain) and framework regions adjacent to<br>
these CDRs (4 sites in each of the heavy chain and light chain).<br>
The amino acid sequence of the constant region is common to antibodies<br>
belonging to the same immunoglobulin class regardless of the type of antigen. In<br>
the variable region, the amino acid sequence of a CDR is intrinsic to each antibody.<br><br>
However, according to a study comparing amino acid sequence data of numerous<br>
antibodies, it is known that the position of the CDR and the length of a framework<br>
sequence are similar between the subunits of different antibodies as long as they<br>
belong to the same subgroup [see Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) in "Sequence of Proteins<br>
of Immunological Interest Vol. II": U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].<br>
Therefore, it is possible to determine the position of the CDRs and framework<br>
regions and further the constant region in each amino acid sequence, by comparing<br>
the amino acid sequences of the heavy chain and the light chain of the anti-human<br>
oculospanin monoclonal antibody of the present invention with the known amino<br>
acid sequence data. Note that the chain length of FRHi, that is, the framework<br>
region located at the side proximal to the N terminus, is sometimes shorter than the<br>
general length of 30 amino acids. In some cases, the framework region is known to<br>
have a minimum of 18 amino acids [see Kabat et al. cited above]. From this, in the<br>
antibody of the present invention, the chain length of the framework region at the<br>
N-terminus of the heavy chain is set at 18 to 30 amino acids, preferably 30 amino<br>
acids, as long as the function of the anti human oculospanin antibody is not impaired.<br>
In summary, only by artificially modifying a peptide having the same amino<br>
acid sequence as each of the CDRs of light chains or heavy chains or a partial<br>
contiguous amino acid sequence thereof, as determined above, thereby<br>
approximating the structure to the tertiary structure of the CDR actually taken from<br>
within the anti-human oculospanin antibody molecule, a binding activity capable of<br>
binding to human oculospanin can be imparted to the CDR [see, for example, USP<br>
No. 5331573]. Hence, a peptide containing the same amino acid sequence as that of<br>
a CDR or a partial amino acid sequence thereof is also included as being a molecule<br>
of the present invention.<br>
A modified amino acid sequence can be prepared by deleting at least one or<br>
more amino acids from its original amino acid sequence in accordance with cassette<br><br>
mutagenesis [see Toshimitu Kishimoto, "New Biochemical Experimental Lecture 2,<br>
Nucleic acid III, Recombinant DNA technique", p 242-251].<br>
Such various types of DNA sequences can be produced in accordance with a<br>
customary method for chemically synthesizing a nucleic acid, for example, the<br>
phosphite triester method [see Hunkapiller, M., et al. (1984) Nature 310, 105-111].<br>
Note that codons corresponding to a desired amino acid are already known per se.<br>
Any codon may be selected. Alternatively, which codon is used can be determined<br>
in accordance with a customary method by considering the frequency with which<br>
codons are used by the host cell. The partial modification of the nucleotide<br>
sequences of codons, may be performed in accordance with a customary method,<br>
more specifically, in accordance with a site-specific mutagenesis method [see Mark,<br>
D.F., et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 5662-5666] using a synthetic<br>
oligonucleotide primer encoding a desired modification.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to check whether a certain type of DNA can<br>
hybridize with DNA encoding a heavy chain or light chain of an anti-human<br>
oculospanin monoclonal antibody of the present invention by subjecting the DNA to<br>
the following experiment performed using a probe DNA labeled with [ot-32P]dCTP,<br>
in accordance with the random primer method [see Feinberg, A.P. and Vogelstein, B.<br>
(1983) Anal. Biochem. 132, 6-13] or the nick translation method [see Maniatis, T., et<br>
al. (1982) in "Molecular Cloning A laboratory Manual" Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory, NY.].<br>
To explain more specifically, the DNA to be checked is adsorbed onto, for<br>
example, a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane. After it is denatured with alkali, if<br>
necessary, the membrane is heated or UV-irradiated, thereby immobilizing the DNA<br>
onto the membrane. The membrane is soaked in a pre-hybridization solution<br>
containing 6X SSC (IX SSC contains 0.15M sodium chloride, 0.015 trisodium<br>
citrate solution) and 5% Denhardt's solution, and 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS),<br><br>
and maintained at 55°C for 4 hours or more. Subsequently, the probe prepared in<br>
advance is added to the pre-hybridization solution so as to have a final specific<br>
activity of 1 x 106 cpm/ml and the temperature is maintained at 60°C overnight.<br>
Thereafter, the membrane is washed with 6X SSC at room temperature for 5 minutes<br>
several times, further washed with 2X SSC for 20 minutes and subjected to<br>
autoradiography.<br>
Using the aforementioned methods, DNA which hybridizes with the DNA<br>
encoding a heavy chain or light chain of the humanized anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody of the present invention can be isolated from a random cDNA library or a<br>
genomic library [see Maniatis, T., et al. (1982) in "Molecular Cloning A Laboratory<br>
Manual" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY.].<br>
Each of the DNA sequences obtained in the aforementioned manner can be<br>
integrated into an expression vector, which can be then introduced into a prokaryotic<br>
or eukaryotic host cell. In this way, the gene (having the DNA) can be expressed in<br>
the host cell. The expression method is the same as the method described in<br>
Section "5. Preparation of anti-human oculospanin antibody", Paragraph "(1)<br>
Preparation of antigen" set forth above.<br>
A fraction containing an anti-human oculospanin antibody protein produced<br>
within or outside the transformant cell can be treated by various known protein<br>
isolation procedures based on the use of physical and/or chemical properties to<br>
isolate and purify the protein. Examples of these methods include treatment with a<br>
protein precipitation agent generally used, ultrafiltration, chromatography, such as<br>
molecular sieve chromatography (gel filtration), adsorption chromatography,<br>
ion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography, or high performance<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC), dialysis, and combinations thereof.<br>
To humanize the anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody, the amino<br>
acid sequence of a variable region must be designed such that the entire CDR<br><br>
sequence and a partial amino acid sequence of the FR sequence determined are<br>
transplanted into a human antibody framework, as follows:<br>
Conventionally, in designing a humanized antibody, an acceptor subgroup is<br>
selected based on the following guidelines.<br>
a)	the natural combination of a heavy chain and light chain of a known human<br>
antibody having a naturally occurring amino acid sequence is used as it is;<br>
b)	although the combination of a heavy chain and a light chain as a subgroup is<br>
maintained; the heavy chain and the light chain may be derived from different human<br>
antibodies. The heavy chain and the light chain which are to be used may be<br>
selected from amino acid sequences with high identity to those of the heavy chain<br>
and light chain of the donor, respectively, and the consensus sequences. In the<br>
present invention, the aforementioned guidelines may be employed. However,<br>
there are alternative methods as follows:<br>
c)	regardless of consideration of the combination of the subgroup, a method may<br>
be employed for selecting FRs of the heavy chain and light chain with high identity<br>
to those of a donor from the library of primary sequences of a human antibody. In<br>
these selection methods, the degree of identity of the amino acids of the FR region<br>
between a donor and an acceptor can be set at 70% or more. By employing such a<br>
method, it is possible to reduce the number of amino acid residues of an antibody to<br>
be transplanted from a donor, thereby inducing less HAMA response.<br>
There is an operation (hereinafter referred to as "molecular modeling") for<br>
predicting the tertiary structure of an antibody molecule from its primary sequence;<br>
however, the accuracy of prediction of this operation is limited. Therefore, the role<br>
of an amino acid residue appearing only rarely in the subgroup to which the donor<br>
belongs cannot be sufficiently specified. It is generally difficult to determine which<br>
amino acid residue of a donor or an acceptor should be selected for such a position of<br>
the amino acid residue in accordance with the method described above by Queen and<br><br>
co-workers. However, in accordance with the selection method (c), it is possible to<br>
reduce the frequency with which such determination must be made.<br>
The present inventors have further improved such humanization methods by<br>
providing a novel method of identifying an amino acid derived from the FR of a<br>
donor and important for maintaining the structure and function of a CDR of the<br>
donor.<br>
After a human acceptor molecule for each of a light chain and heavy chain is<br>
selected, the amino acid residue to be transferred from the FR of a donor is selected<br>
by the method mentioned below.<br>
In the amino acid sequences of the donor and the acceptor, when the<br>
corresponding amino acid residues of their FRs differ from each other, it must be<br>
determined which amino acid residue should be selected. When making such a<br>
selection, care must be taken so as not to damage the tertiary structure of the CDR<br>
derived from the donor.<br>
Queen et al. have proposed, in the Japanese National Publication of<br>
International Patent Application No. 4-502408, a method of transplanting an amino<br>
acid residue on the FR into an acceptor together with a CDR sequence, if it satisfies<br>
at least one of the following conditions,.<br>
1)	The amino acid is rarely present at the position within a human FR region of<br>
an acceptor, whereas the corresponding amino acid of a donor is usually present at<br>
the equivalent position;<br>
2)	the amino acid is located extremely close to one of the CDRs;<br>
3)	it is predicted that the amino acid has a side chain atom within about 3<br>
angstroms from the CDR in its three dimensional immunoglobulin model and the<br>
side chain atom can interact with an antigen or the CDR of a humanized antibody.<br>
In the above, a residue satisfying requirement 2) above often exhibits the<br>
property of requirement 3). Therefore, in the present invention, requirement 2) is<br><br>
omitted and two requirements are newly set. More specifically, in the present<br>
invention, if the amino acid residue on the donor's FR to be transferred together with<br>
the CDR satisfies the following:<br>
a)	the amino acid is rarely present at the position within an FR region of an<br>
acceptor, whereas the corresponding amino acid of a donor is usually present at the<br>
equivalent position;<br>
b)	in the tertiary structure model, the amino acid presumably interacts with a<br>
constituent amino acid atom of the CDR and an antigen or the CDR loop to be<br>
transplanted;<br>
c)	the position mentioned above is that of a canonical class determination<br>
residue; or<br>
d)	the position is that which forms a contact surface between a heavy chain and a<br>
light chain,<br>
then the amino acid residue is transplanted from the FR of the donor.<br>
In requirement a), in accordance with the Kabat list mentioned above, an<br>
amino acid found at a frequency of 90% or more at a position in the same subclass of<br>
antibody is defined as "usually present", whereas an amino acid found at a frequency<br>
of less than 10% is defined as "rarely present".<br>
In requirement c), as to whether or not "the position mentioned above is a<br>
canonical class determining residue", the determination can be made uniquely in<br>
accordance with Chothia's list as mentioned above.<br>
In requirements b) and d), molecular modeling of the antibody's variable<br>
region must be performed in advance. As software for molecular modeling, any<br>
commercially available software may be used; however, preferably AbM<br>
(manufactured by Oxford Molecular Limited Company) is used.<br>
The accuracy of prediction by molecular modeling is somewhat limited.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, by considering X-ray crystallographic data for<br><br>
variable regions of various antibodies, the reliability of the structure predicted by<br>
molecular modeling can be evaluated in two steps.<br>
In the tertiary structure of the variable region constructed by the molecular<br>
modeling software, such as AbM, if the distance between two atoms is shorter than a<br>
value of the sum of the van der Waals radius of two atoms plus 0.5 angstroms, the<br>
two molecules are assumed to be in van der Waals contact. On the other hand, if<br>
the distance between atoms having polarity, such as amide nitrogen or carbonyl<br>
oxygen, of the main and side chains, is shorter than a distance of an average<br>
hydrogen binding distance, 2.9 angstroms plus 0.5 angstroms, it is assumed that<br>
hydrogen bonding may exist between the atoms. Furthermore, if the distance<br>
between the oppositely charged atoms is shorter than a distance of 2.85 angstroms<br>
plus 0.5 angstroms, it is assumed that an ionic bond is formed between the atoms.<br>
On the other hand, from X-ray crystallographic experimental results for<br>
variable regions of various antibodies, as the position on the FR at which contact<br>
with the CDR can be found with a high frequency regardless of the subgroup, the<br>
following positions can be specified: in the light chain, the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 23, 35, 36, 46,<br>
48, 49, 58, 69, 71, and 88th positions, and in the heavy chain, 2, 4, 27, 28, 29, 30, 36,<br>
38, 46, 47, 48, 49, 66, 67, 69*, 71, 73, 78, 92, 93, 94, and 103rd positions (numerals<br>
all represent amino acid numbers defined in the documents described by Kabat et al.<br>
The same definition will be also applied below). When the same standard as that of<br>
the molecular modeling is applied, the amino acid residues of these positions are<br>
confirmed to be in contact with the amino acid residues of the CDR in the 2/3 portion<br>
of the known antibody's variable region. Based on the findings, the sentence: "b) In<br>
the tertiary structure model, the amino acid presumably interacts with a constituent<br>
amino acid atom of the CDR and an antigen or the CDR loop to be transplanted"<br>
means as follows.<br><br>
In molecular modeling, if a position in the FR which is expected to be in<br>
contact with the CDR agrees with any one of the positions at which the contact<br>
between the FR and the CDR is reported to frequently occur according to<br>
experimental detection by X-ray crystallography, selection of the amino acid residue<br>
from the donor is preferred. In other cases, requirement b) is not taken into<br>
consideration.<br>
The sentence: "d) the position is that which forms a contact surface between<br>
the heavy chain and the light chain" means the following requirement. From the<br>
X-ray crystallographic experimental results for the variable regions of various<br>
antibodies, it is confirmed that heavy chain-light chain contact is frequently observed<br>
at the 36, 38, 43, 44, 46, 49, 87, 98th amino acid residues in the light chain and at the<br>
37, 39, 45, 47, 91, 103, and 104th amino acid residues in the heavy chain. In cases<br>
where the possibility of heavy chain-light chain contact is predicted in the molecule<br>
modeling and the contact position agrees with any one of the aforementioned<br>
positions, transplantation of the amino acid residue from the donor is preferably<br>
performed. In other cases, requirement d) is not taken into consideration.<br>
The DNA encoding variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain of a<br>
humanized anti-human oculospanin antibody of the present invention can be<br>
produced by the methods described below.<br>
For example, a plurality of polynucleotide fragments comprising a partial<br>
nucleotide sequence of the DNA, of 60 to 70 nucleotides in length, are chemically<br>
synthesized alternately from the sense and antisense strands. Thereafter, individual<br>
polynucleotide fragments are annealed and ligated using DNA ligase. In this way,<br>
it is possible to obtain a DNA having DNA encoding variable regions of the heavy<br>
chain and light chain of a desired humanized anti-human oculospanin antibody.<br>
In another method, DNA encoding the total amino acid sequence of the<br>
variable region of an acceptor is extracted from human lymphocytes, replacement of<br><br>
nucleotides is performed in the region encoding a CDR by a method known to those<br>
skilled in the art to introduce a restriction enzyme cleavage sequence. After the<br>
region is cleaved with the corresponding restriction enzyme, the nucleotide sequence<br>
encoding a CDR of the donor is synthesized and ligated using DNA ligase. In this<br>
way, it is possible to obtain the DNA encoding variable regions of the heavy chain<br>
and light chain of a desired humanized anti-human oculospanin antibody.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, it is possible to obtain DNA comprising<br>
DNA encoding variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain of a desired<br>
humanized anti-human oculospanin antibody, preferably in accordance with the<br>
overlap extension PCR method (Horton et ah, Gene, 77, 61-68, (1989)) described<br>
below.<br>
To explain more specifically, two different DNA sequences, which encode<br>
two different amino acid sequences, respectively and which are desired to be ligated<br>
to each other, are designated as (A) and (B). for the sake of convenience. A sense<br>
primer of 20 to 40 nucleotides (hereinafter referred to as a "primer (C)") to be<br>
annealed to the 5' side of the DNA sequence (A) and an antisense primer of 20 to 40<br>
nucleotides (hereinafter referred to as a "primer (D)) to be annealed to the 3' side of<br>
the DNA sequence (B) are chemically synthesized. Furthermore, a chimeric-type<br>
sense primer (hereinafter referred to as "primer (E)) is formed by ligating a<br>
nucleotide sequence of 20 to 30 nucleotides to the 3' side of the DNA sequence (A)<br>
and a nucleotide sequence of 20 to 30 nucleotides is ligated to the 5' side of the DNA<br>
sequence (B). An antisense primer (hereinafter referred to as "primer (F))<br>
complementary to the primer (E) is synthesized. When a PCR is performed by<br>
using appropriate vector DNA containing DNA (A) as a substrate, sense primer (C)<br>
and the chimeric-type antisense primer (F), DNA in which the 20 to 30 nucleotides<br>
of the 5' end of DNA (B) is attached to the 3' end of the DNA (A) can be obtained<br>
(the DNA newly formed is designated as DNA (G)). Similarly, when a PCR is<br><br>
performed by using appropriate vector DNA containing DNA (B) as a substrate,<br>
antisense primer (D) and the chimeric-type sense primer (E), DNA in which 20 to 30<br>
nucleotides of the 3' end of DNA (A) is attached to the 5' end of the DNA (B) can be<br>
obtained (the DNA newly formed is designated as DNA (H)). In the DNAs (G) and<br>
(H), the 40 to 60 nucleotides on the 3' side of the DNA (G) form a sequence<br>
complementary to that formed by the 40 to 60 nucleotides on the 5' side of the DNA<br>
(H). The amplified DNA (G) and (H) are mixed and subjected to PCR, DNA (G)<br>
and (H) are formed into a single strand in a first denaturation reaction. Although<br>
most chains of DNA revert to their original states following an annealing reaction, a<br>
part of DNA forms into a hetero-double-stranded DNA by the annealing of the<br>
complementary nucleotide sequence region. A protruding single stranded part is<br>
filled in by a subsequent extension reaction to obtain a chimeric type DNA<br>
(hereinafter referred to as DNA (I)) formed of DNA (A) and DNA (B) ligated to each<br>
other. DNA (I) can be amplified by performing PCR using DNA (I) as a substrate,<br>
the sense primer (C) and the antisense primer (D). In the present invention, DNA<br>
encoding a CDR region of a heavy chain and light chain of an anti-human<br>
oculospanin mouse monoclonal antibody, DNA encoding an FR region of human<br>
immunoglobulin IgG, furthermore DNA encoding a secretion signal of human<br>
immunoglobulin IgG may be used as DNA (A) and (B), on a case-by-case basis, and<br>
subjected to the ligation reaction mentioned above.<br>
Note that codons corresponding to a desired amino acid are known per se and<br>
can be arbitrarily chosen. More specifically, the codons can be determined in<br>
accordance with a customary method in consideration of the frequency with which<br>
the codon is used by a host. A part of nucleotide sequence of the codons may be<br>
modified in accordance with a customary method such as site-specific mutagenesis<br>
(see, Mark, D.F., et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 5662-5666) using a<br>
synthetic oligonucleotide primer encoding a desired modification. Therefore, if<br><br>
each primer is designed so as to introduce a point mutation and thereafter chemically<br>
synthesized, it is possible to obtain DNA encoding variable regions of a heavy chain<br>
and light chain of a desired anti-human oculospanin antibody.<br>
By integrating each of the DNAs of the present invention thus obtained into<br>
an expression vector, a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell can be transformed.<br>
Furthermore, by introducing an appropriate promoter and a sequence related to<br>
phenotypic expression into these vectors, each gene can be expressed in the<br>
corresponding host cell.<br>
By virtue of the method mentioned above, a recombinant anti-human<br>
oculospanin antibody can be manufactured easily with high purity and in high yield.<br>
(4) Preparation of anti-human oculospanin complete human antibody<br>
The complete human antibody refers to a human antibody having only the<br>
gene sequence of an antibody derived from a human chromosome. The anti-human<br>
oculospanin complete human antibody can be obtained by a method using a human<br>
antibody-producing mouse having a human chromosome fragment containing the<br>
genes for a heavy chain and light chain of a human antibody [see Tomizuka, K. et al,<br>

As a method of confirming whether or not the recombinant anti-human<br>
oculospanin antibody thus prepared specifically binds to human oculospanin, the<br><br>
ELISA method used in evaluating the antibody titer of an immunized mouse is<br>
suitably employed.<br>
6. A pharmaceutical composition containing an anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody<br>
From the anti-human oculospanin antibodies obtained by a method described<br>
in Section "5. Preparation of anti-human oculospanin antibody", antibody<br>
neutralizing the biological activity of human oculospanin or an antibody specifically<br>
damaging a cancer cell expressing human oculospanin can be obtained. These<br>
antibodies can inhibit the biological activity of human oculospanin in the living body,<br>
in other words, canceration of a cell. Therefore, they can be used as a medicament,<br>
in particular, as a therapeutic agent for cancer. The activity of an anti-human<br>
oculospanin antibody in neutralizing a biological activity of human oculospanin in<br>
vitro can be determined by the ability to inhibit canceration of a cell in which human<br>
oculospanin is overexpressed. To explain more specifically, the inhibitory activity<br>
can be determined by culturing mouse fibroblast cell strain, NIH3T3, which<br>
overexpresses human oculospanin, adding an anti-human oculospanin antibody to the<br>
culture system in various concentrations. In this way, the inhibitory activities<br>
against focus formation, colony formation and spheroid growth can be determined.<br>
The cytotoxic activity of an anti-human oculospanin antibody against a cancer cell in<br>
vitro can be determined by antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity,<br>
complement-dependent cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cell-mediated<br>
cytotoxicity exhibited by the anti-human oculospanin antibody against a cell<br>
overexpressing human oculospanin. To be more specific, 293T cells<br>
overexpressing human oculospanin are cultured; then, an anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody is added at various concentrations to the culture system. Mouse spleen<br>
cells are further added to the culture system and cultured for an appropriate time.<br>
Thereafter, the ratio of induction of cell death for the cells overexpressing human<br><br>
oculospanin is determined. The effect of an anti-human oculospanin antibody in<br>
cancer treatment can be determined in vivo by using an experimental animal, more<br>
specifically, by administering the anti-human oculospanin antibody to a transgenic<br>
animal overexpressing human oculospanin and determining a change in the cancer<br>
cells.<br>
An antibody thus obtained for neutralizing the biological activity of human<br>
oculospanin or an antibody specifically damaging cancer cells expressing human<br>
oculospanin is useful as a medicament, especially as a pharmaceutical composition<br>
for use in cancer treatment or as an antibody for use in immunological diagnosis of<br>
such a disease. As the type of cancer, skin cancer and melanoma, a kind of skin<br>
cancer, may be mentioned; but cancers that can be treated or diagnosed in<br>
accordance with the invention are not limited to these examples.<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition containing an<br>
anti-human oculospanin antibody in an amount useful for treatment, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsifier, preservative<br>
and/or an auxiliary agent.<br>
A substance to be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable preparation in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is preferably<br>
non-toxic to a patient to which the pharmaceutical composition is to be administered,<br>
in view of the dose and concentration.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can contain<br>
substances, suitable for inclusion in a preparation, which are capable of changing,<br>
maintaining, and stabilizing pH, osmotic pressure, viscosity, transparency, isotonic<br>
condition, aseptic condition, stability, solubility, release rate, absorbtion rate, and<br>
permeability. Examples of such substances for inclusion in a preparation include,<br>
but are not limited to, amino acids such as glycine, alanine, glutamine, asparagine,<br>
arginine, and lysine; anti-oxidant agents such as anti-bacterial agents, ascorbic acid,<br><br>
sodium sulfate and sodium hydrogen sulfite; buffering agents such as phosphate,<br>
citrate, borate buffers, hydrocarbonate, Tris-HCl solution; fillers such as mannitol<br>
and glycine; chelating agents such as ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA); complex<br>
forming agents such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidine, p-cyclodextrin and<br>
hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin; thickening agents such as glucose, mannose, and<br>
dextrin; carbohydrates such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, glucose, mannose,<br>
dextrin; hydrophilic polymers such as colorants, flavors, diluents, emulsifiers,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidine; preservatives such as low molecular weight polypeptides,<br>
base-forming counter ions, benzalkonium chloride, benzoate, salicylic acid,<br>
thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic<br>
acid, and hydrogen peroxide; solvents such as glycerin, propylene glycol, and<br>
polyethylene glycol; sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol; polysorbates such<br>
as suspending agents, PEG, sorbitan ester, polysorbate 20, and polysorbate 80;<br>
surfactants such as Triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol; stability-enhancing<br>
agents such as sucrose, and sorbitol; elasticity-enhancing agents; transport agents,<br>
diluents; excipients; and/or pharmaceutical auxiliary agents such as sodium chloride,<br>
potassium chloride, mannitol/sorbitol. The amount of these substances added to a<br>
preparation is preferably 0.01 to 100 times, more preferably 0.1 to 10 times the<br>
weight of the anti-human oculospanin antibody. Those skilled in the art can<br>
appropriately determine the formulation suitable for preparation of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition depending upon the disease and administration route.<br>
The excipient and carrier used in a pharmaceutical composition may be a<br>
liquid or solid substance. Examples of a suitable excipient and carrier may include<br>
injectable solutions, saline, artificial cerebral spinal fluid and other substances<br>
usually used for parenteral administration. Furthermore, neutral saline and saline<br>
containing serum albumin may be used as a carrier. A pharmaceutical composition<br>
may contain a Tris buffer of pH 7.0 to 8.5 and an acetate buffer of pH 4.0 to 5.5,<br><br>
which may be supplemented with sorbitol and other compounds. A pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the present invention having a selected composition is<br>
prepared with a requisite purity in appropriate drug form, or as a lyophilized product<br>
or a liquid product. To describe this more specifically, a pharmaceutical<br>
composition containing the anti-human oculospanin antibody can be formed into a<br>
lyophilized product using an appropriate excipient such as sucrose.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be<br>
prepared for parenteral use or for oral use for gastrointestinal absorption. The<br>
composition and concentration of a preparation can be chosen depending upon the<br>
administration method. As an anti-human oculospanin antibody contained in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention exhibits higher<br>
affinity for human oculospanin; in other words, the higher the affinity of anti-human<br>
oculospanin antibody for human oculospanin, as expressed by the dissociation<br>
constant (Kd value), that is, the lower the Kd value, the higher the efficacy of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at a lower dose. Therefore,<br>
based on this, the dose amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention to a person can be determined. The humanized anti-human oculospanin<br>
antibody may be administered to a person as a single dose at an interval of 1 to 30<br>
days in an amount of about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg.<br>
Examples of forms of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
may include injections such as drip infusions, suppository agents, pernasal agents,<br>
sublingual agents, and percutaneous absorption agents.<br>
7. Search for a substance having direct interaction<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention is directed to a drug design<br>
approach for obtaining a substance capable of inhibiting the activity of human<br>
oculospanin based on the tertiary structure of the protein. This approach is known<br>
as a rational drug design method and is used to search for a compound capable of<br><br>
efficiently inhibiting or activating a function, such as enzymatic activity or binding to<br>
a ligand, cofactor or DNA. As an example of such a compound, a protease inhibitor<br>
serving as anti-HIV agent presently marketed is well known. In analyzing the<br>
three-dimensional structure of human oculospanin according to the present invention,<br>
a generally well known method such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance conceivably can be used. Furthermore, in searching for or designing a<br>
substance for inhibiting the function of human oculospanin, a computer-aided drug<br>
design method (CADD) can be used. As an example of this case, a low molecular<br>
weight compound (International Publication WO 99/58515) inhibiting the action of<br>
AP-1 is known which is expected to act as a novel genomic drug for treating chronic<br>
rheumatoid arthritis. By virtue of such a method, it is possible to obtain a substance<br>
inhibiting the function of human oculospanin by directly binding to the human<br>
oculospanin or by inhibiting the interaction between the human oculospanin and<br>
other factors.<br>
Furthermore, according to another aspect, the present invention relates to a<br>
polypeptide associated with human oculospanin of the present invention, in other<br>
words, a partner protein for controlling the activity of human oculospanin. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to a screening method for such a partner<br>
protein for controlling the activity of human oculospanin.<br>
One aspect of such a screening method comprises a step of bringing a test<br>
protein sample into contact with human oculospanin, thereby selecting a protein<br>
binding to the human oculospanin. Such a method includes purification of a protein<br>
by making use of its affinity for purified human oculospanin. To describe more<br>
specifically, first, a sequence formed of 6 histidines is bound to human oculospanin<br>
as an affinity tag. The resultant human oculospanin is incubated in a cell extract<br>
solution (that is, a fraction passed through a column charged with nickel-agarose) at<br>
4°C for 12 hours. Then, a nickel-agarose carrier is separately added to the mixture<br><br>
and the mixture is incubated at 4°C for one hour. After the nickel-agarose carrier is<br>
sufficiently washed with a washing buffer, 100 mM imidazole is added to the<br>
mixture to elute a protein specifically binding to human oculospanin and contained in<br>
the cell extract solution. The purified protein is analyzed to determine its structure.<br>
A protein that can be purified as described above includes a protein which binds<br>
directly to human oculospanin and a protein forming a complex as a subunit with a<br>
protein which binds directly to human oculospanin, but having no binding activity<br>
for human oculospanin, thus binding indirectly to human oculospanin [see<br>
Experimental Medicine, Supplementary volume, Biomanual series 5,<br>
"Transcriptional factor investigation method" pp 215-219 (published by Yodosha Co.,<br>
Ltd.)].<br>
As alternative methods, there is a cloning method in accordance with<br>
Far-Western blot (Experimental Medicine, Supplementary volume, New Genetic<br>
Engineering Handbook, pp76-81, published by Yodosha Co., Ltd.), and a two-hybrid<br>
system using a yeast or a mammalian cell (Experimental Medicine, Supplementary<br>
volume, New Genetic Engineering Handbook, pp66-75, published by Yodosha Co.,<br>
Ltd.), and "Checkmate mammalian two hybrid system"(manufactured by Promega).<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to use of these methods.<br>
If cDNA of a partner protein directly or indirectly interacting with human<br>
oculospanin in this manner is available, it can be used in functional screening of a<br>
substance inhibiting the interaction between human oculospanin and the partner<br>
protein. More specifically, a fusion protein of human oculospanin with<br>
glutathione-S-transferase can be prepared. The fusion protein is allowed to bind to<br>
a microplate covered with anti-glutathione-S-transferase antibody and a biotinylated<br>
partner protein is brought into contact with the fusion protein. The binding of the<br>
partner protein with the fusion protein can be detected using alkaline phosphatase<br>
conjugated with streptavidin. When the biotinylated partner protein is added, test<br><br>
substances are added at the same time to select a substance which promotes or<br>
inhibits the binding of the fusion protein and the partner protein. By this method, a<br>
substrate directly acting on the fused protein or a substance directly acting on the<br>
partner protein can be obtained.<br>
When the fused protein binds indirectly to the partner protein via another<br>
factor, the assay is performed in the presence of a cell extraction solution containing<br>
this factor. In this case, a substance, which may act upon the factor, may be<br>
selected.<br>
When the partner protein obtained has the activity of suppressing the function<br>
of human oculospanin, it is possible to screen an anti-cancer agent, for example, a<br>
useful candidate substance as a therapeutic agent for prostate cancer, in accordance<br>
with a test method using an expression vector comprising the human oculospanin<br>
gene, as described above. Furthermore, when the obtained partner protein has the<br>
activity of suppressing the function of human oculospanin, a polynucleotide having a<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding such a suppressor can be used in gene therapy for<br>
cancer.<br>
Such a polynucleotide can be obtained by analyzing the amino acid sequence<br>
of the identified inhibitor, synthesizing an oligonucleotide probe comprising a<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding the amino acid sequence and screening a cDNA<br>
library or genomic library. Furthermore, in the case where a peptide having<br>
inhibitory activity against a function of human oculospanin is derived from an<br>
artificial peptide library synthesized at random, DNA comprising a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding the amino acid sequence of the peptide can be chemically<br>
synthesized.<br>
In gene therapy, a gene encoding such an inhibitor is integrated, for instance,<br>
into a virus vector and a patient can be infected with a virus (attenuated) comprising<br>
the resultant recombinant virus vector. In the body of the patient, an anti-cancer<br><br>
factor is produced and functions to suppress proliferation of cancer cells. In this<br>
manner, it is possible to treat cancer.<br>
As a method of introducing a gene therapeutic agent into a cell, both a gene<br>
transfection using a virus vector and a non-viral gene transfection can be used<br>
[Nikkei Science, 4, (1994), p. 20-45; Experimental Medicine, Extra number, 12 (15)<br>
(1994); Experimental Medicine, Supplementary volume, "Basic Technology of Gene<br>
Therapy" Yodosha, Co., Ltd. (1996)].<br>
Examples of gene transfection using a virus vector include methods of<br>
integrating DNA encoding an inhibitor or a mutated version of the DNA into DNA<br>
virus or using a RNA virus such as retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus,<br>
herpes virus, vaccinia virus, pox virus, polio virus, or sindbis virus and introducing<br>
the virus vector into a body. Of these, methods using retrovirus, adenovirus,<br>
adeno-associated virus, and vaccinia virus are particularly preferred. Examples of<br>
non-viral gene transfection include a method of administering an expression plasmid<br>
directly into the muscle (DNA vaccination method), liposome treatment, lipofection,<br>
microinjection, calcium phosphate treatment, and an electroporation method. Of<br>
these, DNA vaccination and liposome treatment are preferred.<br>
To use a gene therapeutic agent as a medicine in practice, there is an in vivo<br>
method for introducing DNA directly into the body, and an ex vivo method which<br>
comprises taking a certain type of cells out of the body, introducing DNA into the<br>
cells, and returning the cells into the body [Nikkei Science, 4, (1994), p. 20-45; The<br>
Pharmaceutical Monthly, 36(1), 23-48 (1994); Experimental Medicine, Extra number<br>
12 (15) (1994)].<br>
When the gene therapeutic agent is administered in accordance with the in<br>
vivo method, it is administered through an appropriate administration route, such as a<br>
vein, artery, subcutaneous tissue, intradermal tissue, or muscle, which differs<br>
depending upon the type of disease and symptoms. When the agent is administered<br><br>
in accordance with an in vivo method, the gene therapeutic agent is generally<br>
prepared in the form of an injection; however if necessary, a customarily used carrier<br>
may be added. Furthermore, when the agent is prepared in the form of a liposome<br>
or membrane-fused liposome (Sendai virus-liposome, etc.), the liposome agent may<br>
be supplied as a suspension agent, lyophilized agent, or centrifugally concentrated<br>
and lyophilized agent.<br>
A complementary sequence to the nucleotide sequence represented by<br>
Sequence ID. No. 1 or a complementary sequence to a partial sequence of this<br>
nucleotide sequence can be used as a so-called antisense therapy. As an antisense<br>
molecule, use may be made of DNA partially complementary to the nucleotide<br>
sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing and formed<br>
generally of 15 to 30 mer. Also, use may be made of a stable DNA derivative such<br>
as a phosphorothioate derivative, methyphosphonate derivative, or morpholino<br>
derivative of the DNA, or a stable RNA derivative such as 2'-0-alkyl RNA. Such<br>
an antisense molecule can be introduced into a cell by a method known in the art of<br>
the present invention, for example by injecting an extremely small amount of the<br>
antisense molecule, by forming a liposome capsule, or by expressing it by use of a<br>
vector having an antisense sequence. Such an antisense therapy is useful for<br>
treating a disease caused by excessive activity of a protein encoded by the nucleotide<br>
sequence represented by Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing.<br>
A composition containing the antisense oligonucleotide useful as a medicine<br>
can be prepared by a known method including mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. Examples of such a carrier and the preparation method are described in<br>
Applied Antisense Oligonucleotide Technology (1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.). A<br>
preparation containing an antisense oligonucleotide can be administered orally by<br>
mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable appropriate excipient or diluent, in the<br>
form of tablets, capsules, granules, powder or syrup, or administered parenterally in<br><br>
the form of an injection, suppository, patch, or external preparation. These<br>
preparations can be prepared by a known method using additives:<br>
excipients including organic excipients such as sugar derivatives (e.g., lactose, white<br>
sugar (sucrose), glucose, mannitol, and sorbitol); starch derivatives (e.g., corn starch,<br>
potato starch, a starch, and dextrin); cellulose derivatives (e.g., crystalline cellulose);<br>
Arabic gum; dextran; and pullulan; and inorganic excipients such as silicate<br>
derivatives (e.g., soft anhydrous silicic acid, synthesized aluminium silicate, calcium<br>
silicate, and magnesium aluminate metasilicate); phosphates (e.g., calcium hydrogen<br>
phosphate); carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate), and sulfates (e.g., calcium sulfate);<br>
lubricant agents including metal stearates (e.g., stearic acid, calcium stearate, and<br>
magnesium stearate); talc; colloidal silica; waxes (e.g., beeswax and spermaceti wax),<br>
boric acid; adipic acid; sulfates (e.g., sodium sulfate), glycol; fumaric acid; sodium<br>
benzoate; DL leucine; lauryl sulfates (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium<br>
lauryl sulfate); silicates (e.g., anhydrous silicate, silicate hydrate); and starch<br>
derivatives mentioned above; binding agents including hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, macrogol, and the same<br>
compounds as mentioned as excipients; disintegrating agents including cellulose<br>
derivatives (e.g., low substitution degree hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, inner-cross-linked<br>
carboxymethylcellulose sodium; and chemically modified starch celluloses (e.g.,<br>
carboxymethylstarch, carboxymethylstarch sodium, and cross-linked polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone); emulsifying agents including colloid silica (bentnite and bee gum),<br>
metal hydroxides (e.g., magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide), anionic<br>
surfactants (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate and calcium stearate); cationic surfactants<br>
(e.g., benzalkonium chloride) and non-ionic surfactants (e.g., polyoxyethylene<br>
alkylether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ether, and sucrose fatty acid ester);<br>
stabilizing agents including paraoxy benzoates (e.g., methyl paraben, propyl<br><br>
paraben); alcohols (e.g., chloro butanol, benzyl alcohol, and phenylethyl alcohol);<br>
benzalkonium chloride; phenols (e.g., phenol and cresol); thimerosal; dehydro<br>
acetate; and sorbic acid; flavoring agents including sweeteners, acidic flavors and<br>
flavors generally used; and diluents.<br>
As a method of introducing a compound of the present invention into a patient,<br>
a colloidal dispersion system may be used in addition to the aforementioned methods.<br>
The colloidal dispersion system is expected to contribute to increasing the stability of<br>
the compound in the body and efficiently transporting the compound to a specific<br>
organ, tissue or cell. The choice of colloidal dispersion system is not particularly<br>
limited as long as it is generally used, and for example, a lipid-based dispersion<br>
system may be used which includes polymer complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres,<br>
beads, or oil-in-water emulsifiers, micelles, micelle mixtures, or liposomes. A<br>
preferable colloidal dispersion system consists of multiple liposomes or vesicles of<br>
an artificial membrane, which is effective in efficiently transferring a compound to a<br>
specific organ, tissue or cell (Mannino et al, Biotechniques, 1988, 6, 682; Blume and<br>
Cevc, Biochem. et Biophys. Acta, 1990, 1029, 91; Lappalainen et al, Antiviral Res.,<br>
1994, 23, 119; Chonn and Cullis, Current Op. Biotech., 1995, 6, 698).<br>
A unilamellar liposome ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 urn in size is capable of<br>
encapsulating a large proportion of macromolecules contained in an aqueous buffer.<br>
A compound can be encapsulated in such an aqueous inner membrane and<br>
transported to the brain cells in biological active form (Fraley et al, Trends Biochem.<br>
Sci., 1981, 6, 77). The liposome is generally composed of a mixture of a lipid,<br>
particularly a phospholipid, more particularly a phospholipid having a high phase<br>
transition temperature, with one or more types of steroid, in particular, cholesterol.<br>
Examples of a lipid useful for producing a liposome include phosphatidyl<br>
compounds such as phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidylserine,<br>
sphingolipid, phosphatidylethanolamine, cerebroside, and ganglioside. Of these,<br><br>
particularly useful is diacylphosphatidyl glycerol in which a lipid moiety has 14 to 18<br>
carbon atoms, in particular, 16 to 18 carbon atoms and is saturated (that is, no double<br>
bond is present within the C14-C18 carbon atom chain). Typical phospholipids<br>
include phosphatidyl choline, dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline and distearoyl<br>
phosphatidyl choline.<br>
The colloidal dispersion system containing liposomes can be used for passive<br>
or active targeting. Passive targeting can be attained using a tendency inherent to<br>
liposomes, which tend to distribute in the reticuloendothelial system of an organ<br>
containing sinusoids. Alternatively, active targeting can be attained by modifying a<br>
liposome, for example, by binding a specific ligand thereto, such as viral protein coat<br>
(Morishita et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.), 1993, 90, 8474), a monoclonal<br>
antibody (or its appropriate binding portion), sugar, glycolipid, or protein (or its<br>
appropriate oligopeptide fragment); or alternatively, by modifying the composition<br>
of the liposome in order to distribute it in organs or cell types other than those where<br>
liposomes are naturally localized. The surface of the colloidal dispersion system<br>
can be modified in various methods for targeting. In a delivery system using a<br>
liposome as a targeting means, to maintain a ligand for use in targeting by keeping<br>
tight association with a lipid bilayer, a lipid group is integrated into the lipid bilayer<br>
of the liposome. To bind a lipid chain to the targeting ligand, various linking<br>
groups can be used. Examples of such a targeting ligand binding to a specific cell<br>
surface molecule predominantly found on the cell to which an oligonucleotide<br>
according to the present invention is desired to be delivered include (1) hormone,<br>
growth factor or an appropriate oligopeptide fragment thereof binding to a specific<br>
cellular receptor predominantly expressed by a cell to which delivery is desired; and<br>
(2) a polyclonal antibody, monoclonal antibody, or an appropriate fragment thereof<br>
(e.g., Fab; F (ab)'2) specifically binding to an antigenic epitope predominantly found<br>
on a target cell. Two or more bio activators can be formed into a complex within a<br><br>
single liposome and administered. A medicinal agent for improving intracellular<br>
stability and/or targeting ability of the contents can be added to the colloidal<br>
dispersion system.<br>
Although a therapeutic gene of the present invention can be used in an amount<br>
varying with symptom intensity, age, etc. In the case of peroral administration, the<br>
lowermost limit per dose is 1 mg (preferably 30 mg) and the uppermost limit per<br>
dose is 2,000 mg (preferably 1,500 mg). In the case of injection, the lowermost<br>
limit per dose is 0.1 mg (preferably 5 mg) and the uppermost limit per dose is 1,000<br>
mg (preferably 500 mg). Such a dose can be administered subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly or intravenously.<br>
Now, the present invention will be more specifically described in detail by<br>
way of Examples, which should not be construed as limiting the present invention.<br>
Note that individual operations regarding gene manipulation in the following<br>
Examples are performed in accordance with the methods described in "Molecular<br>
Cloning" (by Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F. and Maniatis, T., published by Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press 1989), or performed using commercially available reagents<br>
or kits in accordance with the protocols thereof.<br>
[Example 1] Screening of a gene specifically expressed in a cancer cell<br>
Expression profile analysis was performed, using an EST probe (Affymetrix<br>
GeneChip HG-133 probe 223795_at: manufactured by Affymetrix) having a<br>
nucleotide sequence partially overlapping with the sequence represented by<br>
Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing, by use of the data base (GeneExpress<br>
Software System Release 1.4.2) provided by Genelogic company.<br>
Expression of the human oculospanin gene in various cells was quantitatively<br>
compared by considering its transcription. As a result, the expression levels in 8<br>
melanocyte samples were to found to be significantly high, compared to the levels in<br>
other cells samples, including 12 blood-cell samples, 6 glia cell samples, 62<br><br>
epithelial cell samples (P values thereof were 
sequentially in order, Figure 1, upper panel).<br>
Next, the expression levels of the human oculospanin gene were compared in<br>
samples derived from tissue. More specifically, the amount of transcription was<br>
compared with respect to 66 skin samples from healthy individuals and 33 melanoma<br>
samples. As a result, the amount of transcription in the melanoma samples was<br>
found to be significantly high (P value=0.0001, Figure 1, lower panel).<br>
Furthermore, when skin samples from 66 healthy individuals were compared with 12<br>
melanoma samples derived from the melanoma skin tissue, the amount of<br>
transcription in the melanoma samples was found to be significantly higher (P<br>
value=0.007, Figure 2, upper panel).<br>
When 66 healthy person's skin samples were compared to 12 melanoma<br>
samples derived from lymph node tissue, the amount of transcription in the<br>
melanoma samples was found to be significantly higher (P value=0.0003, Figure 2,<br>
lower panel).<br>
Furthermore, when 13 healthy person's samples derived from lymph node<br>
were compared to 12 melanoma samples derived from lymph node tissue, the amount<br>
of transcription in the melanoma samples was found to be significantly higher (P<br>
value=0.0011, the panel of Figure 3).<br>
[Example 2] Acquisition of the human oculospanin gene and construction of<br>
expression plasmid<br>
a) PCR reaction<br>
As a primer for amplifying human oculospanin cDNA by PCR,<br>
oligonucleotides having the following sequences were synthesized in accordance<br>
with a customary method.<br>
5'-CACCATGGAGGAGGGGGAGAGGAGCCC-3' (Primer 1, Sequence ID No. 5<br>
of the sequence listing)<br><br>
5'-GCCCCGGGCGGGTTTGGCAGCGG-3' (Primer 2, Sequence ID No. 6 of the<br>
sequence listing)<br>
Note that Primer 1 is an oligonucleotide constructed by adding 4 bases, CACC, as a<br>
KOZAK sequence, upstream of the initiation codon of the human oculospanin gene,<br>
in other words, an oligonucleotide constructed by adding the 4 bases, the CACC<br>
sequence, to the 5' side of the nucleotide sequence consisting of nucleotides No. 1 to<br>
23 of the Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing. The CACC sequence, since it<br>
forms a chain complementary to the 3' terminus of the vector when it is integrated<br>
into the cloning vector pENTR/D-TOPO, makes it possible to integrate the gene into<br>
the vector whilst maintaining the orientation of the gene. Primer 2 is an<br>
oligonucleotide composed of a chain complementary to a nucleotide sequence<br>
consisting of nucleotides No. 1043 to 1065 of the sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence<br>
listing.<br>
The PCR reaction was performed using PLATINUM PJx DNA polymerase<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen) in accordance with the protocol provided. More<br>
specifically, to 0.1 µl of the first strand cDNA obtained, 1.5 µl of each of 10 pmol/µl<br>
synthetic primer 1 and synthetic primer 2, 5 u.1 of 10X Pfic Amplification Buffer, 1.5<br>
µl of 10 mM dNTP Mix, 1 µl of 50 mM MgS04, 0.5 µg of PLATINUM Pfx DNA<br>
polymerase, 10 µl of 10X PCRx Enhancer Solution, and 28.9 µl of sterilized water<br>
were added to prepare 50 µl of a PCR reaction solution. The PCR reaction was<br>
performed using a Peltier Thermal Cycler TPC-200 DNA Engine (manufactured by<br>
MJ Research), first by heating the PCR solution at 94°C for 2 minutes, repeating 5<br>
times a thermal cycle consisting of reactions at 94°C for 30 seconds and 65°C for 2<br>
minutes; 5 times a thermal cycle consisting of reactions at 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C<br>
for 40 seconds, and 68°C for one minute and 20 seconds; 5 times a thermal cycle<br>
consisting of reactions at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 40 seconds, and 68°C for<br><br>
one minute and 20 seconds; 35 times a thermal cycle consisting of reactions at 94°C<br>
for 30 seconds, 50°C for 40 seconds, and 68°C for one minute and 20 seconds and<br>
finally maintaining the PCR solution at 68°C for 10 minutes, and then storing the<br>
solution at 4°C. A desired cDNA was obtained by subjecting the reaction product<br>
to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, confirming amplification of the NM_031945<br>
cDNA (1069bp), and purifying the DNA from the agarose gel using the S.N.A.P.<br>
UV-Free Gel Purification Kit (manufactured by Invitrogen) in accordance with the<br>
protocol provided. The concentration of cDNA thus purified was determined by<br>
use of ID Image Analysis Software Version 3.5 (Kodak Digital Science EDAS290:<br>
manufactured by Kodak) with reference to a lkb DNA Ladder which was used as a<br>
concentration reference.<br>
b) Cloning of the human oculospanin cDNA into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector<br>
The NM_031945 cDNA obtained in Example 2a) was cloned into the<br>
pENTR/D-TOPO vector using the pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen) in accordance with the protocol provided. More<br>
specifically, NM_031945 cDNA was mixed with the pENTR/D-TOPO vector,<br>
having Topoisomerase bound thereto, in the reaction buffer supplied with the kit and<br>
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. OneShot TOP10 Chemically<br>
Competent E. coli (manufactured by Invitrogen) was transformed using the reaction<br>
product obtained and cultured on an LB agar medium containing 50 µg/ml<br>
kanamycin. The resultant E. coli colonies, which exhibited resistance to kanamycin,<br>
were selected and cultured, in a liquid TB medium containing 1 ml of 50 ug/ml<br>
kanamycin, at 37°C overnight. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified by using a<br>
Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 Kit (manufactured by Millipore). Then, the plasmid<br>
DNA thus obtained was subjected to a reaction using the BigDye Terminator v3.0<br>
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit in accordance with the protocol provided, the<br>
nucleotide sequence was analyzed using an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA Analyzer<br><br>
(manufactured by Applied Biosystems). As a result, it was confirmed that cDNA<br>
(Sequence ID No. 1 of the sequence listing) having an open reading frame of the<br>
nucleotide represented by GenBank ACCESSION NO.NM_031945 was integrated<br>
into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector.<br>
Next, the gene was transferred to an expression vector, pcDNA3.1/DEST40<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen), using the GATEWAY™ system. To explain more<br>
specifically, 4 µl of GATEWAY™ LR Clonase™ Enzyme Mix (manufactured by<br>
Invitrogen), 4 µl of LR Reaction Buffer, 0.3 µg of pENTR/D-TOPO-NM_031945,<br>
and 0.3 u.g of pcDNA3.1/DEST40 were mixed and made up to a 20 µl reaction<br>
solution in TE buffer. The reaction solution was allowed to react at 25°C for one<br>
hour. After the reaction, 2 µl of proteinase K was added and a reaction was<br>
performed at 37°C for 10 minutes. Using the resulting reaction product, OneShot<br>
TOP 10 Chemically Competent E. coli (manufactured by Invitrogen) were<br>
transformed and cultured in a LB agar medium containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin.<br>
The resulting E. coli colonies, exhibiting ampicillin resistance, were selected and<br>
cultured in 100 ml of liquid LB medium containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin at 37°C<br>
overnight, and plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945) was isolated and<br>
purified by use of Plasmid MAXI Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN).<br>
[Example 3] Introduction of the human oculospanin gene into cells, confirmation<br>
that the human oculospanin gene product is expressed, and preparation of a<br>
membrane fraction from human oculospanin expressing cells for use as an<br>
immunogen<br>
a) Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with the plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1 -DEST40-NM_031945<br>
NIH3T3	cells	were	transfected	with	plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945 obtained in Example 2 as follows. The<br>
transfection of the NIH3T3 cells was performed by lipofection using the<br><br>
Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent manufactured by Invitrogen. To explain more<br>
specifically, first, NIH3T3 cells were grown in a 6 well plate up to a semi-confluent<br>
state. Next, the cells were washed once with antibiotic-free DMEM containing<br>
10% fetal calf serum, then 200 µl of antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% fetal calf<br>
serum was added to the cells. Then, to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, 100 µl of<br>
serum-free medium (DMEM) and 2 µg of plasmid DNA<br>
(pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945) recovered in the aforementioned manner were<br>
added and mixed. To another 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, 96 µl of serum-free medium<br>
(DMEM) and 4 µl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 Reagent were added and mixed. The<br>
DNA solution and the Lipofectamine solution were mixed and allowed to stand still<br>
at room temperature for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the DNA-Lipofectamine solution<br>
mixture was added to the cells and cultured at 37°C in 5% C02. After 4 hours, 1 ml<br>
of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum was added to the cells which were<br>
cultured at 37°C overnight in 5% C02.<br>
b)	Confirmation	of expression	of the	plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945 in NIH3T3 cells<br>
The cell culture product thus obtained was recovered. The negative control<br>
containing no cDNA or NIH3T3 cells transfected with the<br>
pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945 obtained were washed with a PBS (-) buffer<br>
solution (manufactured by Invitrogen). The cells were dispersed in a sample buffer<br>
solution (manufactured by BioRad) containing 2-mercaptoethanol for use in SDS<br>
polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE was performed using<br>
12.5% polyacrylamide gel (e PAGEL E-T12.5L; manufactured by ATTO<br>
corporation) under reducing conditions.<br>
After electrophoresis, bands were transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to a<br>
Polyvinylidene Difluoride(PVDF) membrane (manufactured by Millipore) by use of<br>
a gel-membrane transfer apparatus (NP7513 manufactured by Marysol) in a transfer<br><br>
buffer solution (192 mM glycine, 20% methanol, 25 mM Tris) under the following<br>
conditions: 4 °C, 120 minutes and 200 mA.<br>
After transfer, the PVDF membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis<br>
using an anti-V5-tag antibody (manufactured by Invitrogen). To explain more<br>
specifically, first, the PVDF membrane was blocked using blockace (manufactured<br>
by Yukijirushi Co.,) once at room temperature for 30 minutes, and put in a plastic<br>
bag (trade name: Hybribag manufactured by Cosmo Bio). To the bag, the<br>
anti-V5-tag antibody (1000-fold dilution) and 5 ml of blockace were added and the<br>
bag was shaken at room temperature for one hour. After one hour, the membrane<br>
was removed and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "0.05% Tween 20-PBS) once at room temperature for 15 minutes and twice for<br>
5 minutes. Thereafter, the membrane was transferred to a new plastic bag. To the<br>
bag, 30 ml of a solution containing a horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-rabbit IgG<br>
antibody (manufactured by Amersham Pharmacia) diluted 5000 fold with 0.05%<br>
Tween 20-PBS, was added and shaken at room temperature for one hour. After one<br>
hour, the membrane was taken out and washed with 0.05% Tween 20-PBS once for<br>
15 minutes and four times for 5 minutes. After washing, the membrane was placed<br>
on a wrapping film and a band having the anti-V5-tag antibody bound thereto was<br>
detected by use of ECL Western blotting detection solution (manufactured by<br>
Amersham Pharmacia). The membrane was placed on the wrapping film and<br>
soaked in the ECL Western blotting detection solution for one minute and then<br>
exposed to an X-ray film (one minute). As a result, a band specific to the NIH3T3<br>
cells having plasmid pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945 DNA introduced therein was<br>
detected due to the presence of the anti-V5-tag antibody (Figure 4).<br>
c) Transfection of BALB-3T3 cells with the plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1 -DEST40-NM_031945<br><br>
BALB-3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection No. CCL-163) were<br>
cultured in three Cell Trays (culturing area: 500 cm2 manufactured by Sumitomo<br>
Bakelite Co., Ltd.) for cell culture in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as "DMEM") manufactured by Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.,<br>
Ltd., containing 10% bovine serum (hereinafter referred to as "BS") manufactured by<br>
Gibco), at 37°C in 5% CO2 gas up to a semi-confluent state. Thereafter, the<br>
BALB-3T3	cells	were	transfected	with	the	plasmid<br>
pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945. The transfection of the BALB-3T3 cells was<br>
performed by lipofection using Geneporter™ 2 Transfection Reagent (manufactured<br>
by Gene Therapy Systems). To explain more specifically, the cells were washed<br>
once using a serum-free medium, DMEM. To the cells, 500 ml of the serum-free<br>
medium (DMEM) was added. Then, to a 50 ml Falcon tube, 6 ml of New DNA<br>
diluent and 240 ug of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945) recovered<br>
by the aforementioned method were added and mixed. To another 50 ml Falcon<br>
tube, 4.8 ml of serum-free medium (DMEM) and 1200 µl of Geneporter™ 2 Reagent<br>
were added and mixed. The DNA solution and the Geneporter™ 2 solution were<br>
mixed and allowed to stand still at room temperature for 20 minutes. Thereafter,<br>
the solution mixture with DNA-Geneporter™ 2 was added to the cells (4 ml/tray)<br>
and cultured at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. After 4 hours, DMEM containing<br>
20% bovine serum was added in an amount of 50 ml/tray and cultured at 37°C in 5%<br>
CO2 overnight.<br>
d) Preparation of the cell membrane fraction<br>
The cells cultured by the aforementioned method were washed with PBS (-)<br>
buffer solution (manufactured by Invitrogen). The cells were collected using a cell<br>
scraper (manufactured by Sumitomo bakelite Co., Ltd.), and suspended in 7 ml of 5<br>
mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0. The resulting cell solution was allowed to stand still at<br>
4°C for 30 minutes. The cells were crushed using a Dounce Type B homogenizer<br><br>
(30 strokes) and centrifuged at 1000G for 10 minutes. The supernatant was<br>
recovered and centrifuged at 78,000G for 100 minutes using an ultracentrifugation<br>
apparatus (manufactured by Hitachi) and the precipitate was recovered. The<br>
precipitate was subjected to a sugar density gradient to concentrate the membrane<br>
fragments. More specifically, the precipitate was dissolved in 3 ml of a solution of<br>
57% sugar and 0.25M Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The resulting solution was transferred to<br>
an ultracentrifuge tube. An aliquot of 3 ml of a solution of 57% sugar and 0.25M<br>
Tris buffer, pH 8.0 and 1.5 ml of a solution of 37.5% sugar and 0.25M Tris buffer pH<br>
8.0 were layered sequentially onto the cell precipitate solution. Then,<br>
centrifugation was performed using an ultracentrifugation apparatus at 75,500G for<br>
16 hours. An aliquot of 1 ml was taken from the top of each tube. To each aliquot<br>
(fraction), 10 mL of 5 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0 was added and this was subjected to<br>
ultracentrifugation at 78,000G for one hour to recover the precipitate. To the<br>
precipitate 500 µl of 5 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 was added and the cell solution was<br>
homogenized using a Dounce type B homogenizer (10 strokes). The cell membrane<br>
fraction was identified by Western Blotting method described in the Section<br>
"Confirmation of Expression" and used as an immunogen.<br>
[Example 4] Immunization of mice and cell fusion<br>
(4-1) Immunization<br>
1 ml (total protein amount: 100 µg) of the membrane fraction solution of the<br>
human oculospanin expressing cells obtained in Example 3 was injected<br>
intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice which were 4 to 10 weeks old (purchased from<br>
Japan SLC Inc.) After two weeks, the same membrane fraction solution (20 µg<br>
protein/mouse) was injected into the abdominal cavity as a booster immunization.<br>
(4-2) Cell fusion<br>
The spleen was excised from a mouse at three days after the booster<br>
immunization and added to 10 ml of a serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (10.4 g/1,<br><br>
RPMI 1640 "Nissui"(l): manufactured by Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,<br>
hereinafter referred to as "serum-free RPMI medium") containing 20 mM HEPES<br>
buffer (pH 7.3), 350 mg/ml sodium hydrogen carbonate, 0.05 mM<br>
P-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 )j.g/ml streptomycin, and 300 u.g/ml L<br>
glutamic acid, and the spleen was crushed on the mesh of a cell strainer (cell strainer;<br>
manufactured by Falcon) using a spatula. The cell suspension solution passed<br>
through the mesh was centrifuged to collect the spleen cells. The spleen cells were<br>
washed twice with serum-free RPMI medium, suspended in serum-free RPMI<br>
medium and the number of cells was counted.<br>
Myeloma cells NSI (American Type Culture Collection TIB-18) were<br>
cultured in ASF 104 medium (manufactured by Ajinomoto; hereinafter referred to as<br>
the "serum-containing ASF medium") containing 10% FCS (manufactured by Gibco<br>
BRL) at 37°C in 5% C02 gas such that the cell density did not exceed 1 x 108<br>
cells/ml. The myeloma cells thus prepared were washed with serum-free RPMI<br>
medium in the same manner as above and suspended in serum-free RPMI medium<br>
and the number of cells was counted.<br>
The NSI cell suspension solution containing about 3 x 107 cells and the spleen<br>
cell suspension solution containing about 3 xlO8 cells were mixed and subjected to<br>
centrifugation, and thereafter the supernatant was completely removed. The cell<br>
fusion operation below was performed whilst maintaining the plastic centrifuge tube<br>
containing the pellet in a beaker containing hot water at 37°C. To the pellet, 1 ml<br>
of 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (manufactured by Boehringer Mannheim)<br>
was slowly added by pipette whilst agitating the pellet using the tip. Thereafter; 1<br>
ml of the serum-free RPMI medium, previously warmed to 37°C, was gently added<br>
in twice and a further 7 ml of serum-free RPMI medium was added. After<br>
centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and 10 ml of hypoxanthine aminopterin<br>
thymidine medium (hereinafter referred to as "HAT medium"; manufactured by<br><br>
Boehringer Mannheim) containing 10% FCS was added by pipette whilst gently<br>
agitating using the tip. After 20 ml of the HAT medium containing 10% FCS was<br>
added, the resulting solution was dispensed to a 96-well cell culture microplate at an<br>
amount of 100 µl/well and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 gas. Seven to eight days<br>
later, to wells containing medium with a tinge of yellow, fresh HAT medium was<br>
added in an amount of 100 µl/well. The fused cells thus obtained were subjected to<br>
screening by limiting dilution analysis as mentioned below.<br>
(4-3) Limiting dilution<br>
The thymus gland was excised from female BALB/c mouse which were 4 to<br>
10 weeks old (purchased from Japan SLC Inc.) and crushed on the mesh of a cell<br>
strainer (Cell Strainer, manufactured by Falcon) using a spatula. The cells passed<br>
through the mesh were washed twice with hypoxanthine thymidine medium<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the "HT medium", manufactured by Boehringer<br>
Mannheim) containing 10% FCS. The thymus gland cells of the mouse were<br>
suspended in 30 ml of the HT medium containing 10% FCS. The suspension<br>
solution thus obtained was used as a feeder cell solution. The culture solution<br>
containing the fused cells obtained in Section (4-2) was diluted 10 to 100 fold with<br>
the feeder cell solution depending upon the cell density and further serially diluted<br>
with the feeder cell solution until the density of the fused cells was 5 cells/ml, 1<br>
cell/ml and 0.5 cells/ml. Each of the samples thus prepared was dispensed into a<br>
96-well cell culture microplate in an amount of 100 µl per well and cultured at 37°C<br>
in 5% C02 gas for 5 days.<br>
(4-4) Screening<br>
(4-4-1) Cell ELISA<br>
Human oculospanin expressing cells were maintained by culturing them in<br>
RPMI 1640 medium (manufactured by Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf<br>
serum (manufactured by Moregate Biotech), 20 mM HEPES (manufactured by<br><br>
Sigma) and 55 uM 2-mercaptoethanol (manufactured by Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5%<br>
CO2 gas. Human oculospanin expressing cells in the logarithmic growth phase<br>
were seeded into a cell culture flask at a density of 2 x 104 cells/cm2 and cultured for<br>
3 days. The human oculospanin expressing cells thus prepared were transferred to a<br>
50 ml tube and centrifuged using a HITACHI himac CF8DL at 1,000 rpm for 5<br>
minutes (Centrifugation condition 1). The supernatant was removed and the human<br>
oculospanin expressing cells were suspended in a medium. Thereafter, the number<br>
of living cells was counted using 0.4% tryphan blue solution (manufactured by<br>
Sigma). The density of the live human oculospanin expressing cells was adjusted<br>
using the medium to be 107 cells per ml and the resultant medium was dispensed to a<br>
96-well U-bottom plate in an amount of 100 ul/well. The 96-well U-bottom plate<br>
was centrifuged using a HITACHI himac CF8DL at 15,000 rpm for one minute<br>
(Centrifugation condition 2). The supernatant was removed using a 200 µl tip.<br>
The 96-well U-bottom plate was tapped on the side surface to suspend the human<br>
oculospanin expressing cells. To the suspension, hybridoma culture supernatant<br>
solutions whose concentrations were adjusted to 10 µg/ml, 5 u.g/ml, 2.5 µg/ml with a<br>
medium cooled on ice, were added in an amount of 100 µl/well. Whilst the 96-well<br>
U-bottom plate was stirred using a plate mixer (manufactured by Fujirebio Inc.) at<br>
intervals of 15 minutes, a reaction was performed at 4°C for 1.5 hours. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the 96-well U-bottom plate was centrifuged under<br>
Centrifugation condition 2, and the supernatant was removed using a 200 µl tip. A<br>
solution (PBS-5%FBS) prepared by adding 5% fetal calf serum to<br>
PBS(-)(manufactured by Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was added to the wells in<br>
an amount of 200 µl per well. After stirring using a plate mixer, centrifugation was<br>
performed under Centrifugation condition 2 and the supernatant was removed using a<br>
200 ul tip. Thereafter, the aforementioned operation was repeated twice. The<br>
96-well U-bottom plate was tapped on the side surface to suspend the human<br><br>
oculospanin expressing cells. To the suspension, peroxidase-labeled anti-human<br>
IgG antibody (manufactured by Kirkegaad &amp; Perry Laboratories) diluted 500 fold<br>
with PBS-5%FBS cooled in ice was added in an amount of 100 µl/well. While the<br>
96-well U-bottom plate was stirred using a plate mixer at intervals of 15 minutes, a<br>
reaction was performed at 4°C for 1.5 hours. After completion of the reaction, the<br>
96-well U-bottom plate was centrifuged under Centrifugation condition 2 and the<br>
supernatant was removed using a 200 µ1 tip. Then, PBS-5%FBS was added in an<br>
amount of 200 ul/well and stirred using a plate mixer, centrifuged under<br>
Centrifugation condition 2, and then the supernatant was removed using a 200 µl tip.<br>
Thereafter, the aforementioned operation was repeated twice. The 96-well<br>
U-bottom plate was tapped on the side surface to suspend the human oculospanin<br>
expressing cells. To the suspension, a color development substrate for peroxidase<br>
(manufactured by Nacalai Tesque Inc.) adjusted to room temperature was added in<br>
an amount of 100 µl/well and stirred using a plate mixer for 10 minutes. After<br>
centrifugation was performed under Centrifugation condition 2, the supernatant was<br>
transferred to 96-well flat-bottomed plate in an amount of 50 µl/well and absorbance<br>
was measured at 405 nm using a plate reader (1420 ARVO multilabel counter,<br>
manufactured by PerkinElmer Inc.)<br>
(4-4-2) Flow cytometry<br>
The human oculospanin expressing cells obtained in Example 3 were cultured<br>
and grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS at 37°C in 5% CO2 gas. A<br>
cell suspension solution, prepared so as to contain 1 x 107 cells/ml, was dispensed<br>
into 96-well U-bottom microplate (manufactured by Nunk) in an amount of 50<br>
µl/well and centrifuged (at 90 x g, 4°C for 10 minutes). The supernatant was<br>
removed and the supernatant of the fused cells cultured in Section (4-3) above was<br>
added in an amount of 50 µl/well and stirred. The plate was allowed to stand for<br>
one hour on ice, subjected to centrifugation (at 90 x g, 4°C for 10 minutes) and the<br><br>
supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed twice with a flow cytometric<br>
buffer solution (PBS containing 5% FCS and 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide) in an<br>
amount of 100 µl/well and 50 ul of 500-fold diluted goat anti-mouse IgG antibody<br>
IgG fraction (manufactured by Organon Technica) labeled with<br>
fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (hereinafter referred to as "FITC") was added as a<br>
secondary antibody and allowed to stand still on ice for one hour. After<br>
centrifugation (at 90 x g, 4°C for 10 minutes), the supernatant was removed. The<br>
pellet was washed twice with 100 ul of the flow cytometric buffer solution per well,<br>
and thereafter 50 ul of a 3.7% formalin solution was added and the resulting solution<br>
mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes on ice. In this manner, the cells were<br>
immobilized. After centrifugation (at 90 x g, 4°C for 10 minutes), the supernatant<br>
was removed. The pellet was washed again with 100 µl of the flow cytometric<br>
buffer solution per well and suspended in 100 µl of the flow cytometric buffer per<br>
well. This was used as a sample for flow cytometry. The intensity of FITC<br>
fluorescence emitted from the cells in each sample was measured using a flow<br>
cytometer (Epics Elite manufactured by Coulter) at an excitation wavelength of 488<br>
nm and a detection wavelength of 530 nm. When the FITC fluorescence intensity<br>
of the human oculospanin expressing cells exposed to supernatant from the fusion<br>
cell culture was much higher (about 100 to 1,000) than that (about 0.3) of the human<br>
oculospanin expressing cells unexposed to the supernatant from the fusion cell<br>
culture, the corresponding fusion cells were selected.<br>
(4-5) Cloning<br>
The cells selected in Section (4-4) above were subjected to a series of steps<br>
(4-3) to (4-4), five times. In this way, several hybridoma clones were obtained<br>
which were capable of producing a single antibody capable of binding to human<br>
oculospanin expressing cells but incapable of binding to the non-transfected parent<br>
cells.<br><br>
[Example 5] Purification of human oculospanin monoclonal antibody<br>
Mouse-mouse hybridoma cells constructed in Example 4 were cultured in 1<br>
litre of ASF medium containing 10% FCS at 37°C in 5% C02 gas until the cell<br>
density reached 1 x 106 cells/ml. The culture solution was centrifuged (at 1,000<br>
rpm for 2 minutes), the supernatant was discarded, and the cells collected were<br>
washed once using serum-free ASF medium. Thereafter, the cells were<br>
resuspended in 1 litre of serum-free ASF medium and cultured at 37°C in 5% C02<br>
gas for 48 hours. The culture solution was centrifuged (at 1,000 rpm for 2 minutes)<br>
and the supernatant was recovered and transferred into a dialysis tube (exclusion<br>
limit molecular weight: 12,000 to 14,000, manufactured by Gibco BRL). Dialysis<br>
was performed against a 10-fold amount of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution<br>
(pH 8.0). The IgG contained in the solution within the dialysis tube was crudely<br>
purified using high performance liquid chromatographic apparatus (FPLC system,<br>
manufactured by Pharmacia) under the conditions described below:<br>
Column: DEAE Sepharose CL-6B column (Column size 10 ml, manufactured by<br>
Pharmacia)<br>
Solvent: 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 8.0)<br>
Flow rate: 1 ml/minute<br>
Elution: 1M sodium chloride linear concentration gradient (0-50%, 180 minutes)<br>
The eluate was fractionated into 5 ml samples. The antibody titer of the<br>
anti-human oculospanin antibody in each fraction was checked by the ELISA method<br>
using human oculospanin protein. First, a membrane fraction solution prepared<br>
from human oculospanin expressing cells prepared in Example 3 was added to a<br>
96-well microplate for ELISA in an amount of 100 µl/well and kept warm at 37°C<br>
for one hour. Then the membrane fraction solution was discarded and each well<br>
was washed three times with 100 µ1 of PBS-Tween per well. Then, 100 µl of PBS<br>
containing 2% bovine serum albumin was added per well and kept warm at 37°C for<br><br>
one hour. After washing three times with 100 µl of PBS-Tween per well, 100 µl of<br>
the elution fraction was added and kept warm at 37°C for one hour. Furthermore,<br>
after wells were washed three times with 100 yd of PBS-Tween per well, horseradish<br>
peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (manufactured by<br>
Amersham) diluted 2000 fold in PBS-Tween was added in an amount of 100 µl/well<br>
and allowed to react at 37°C for one hour, and then washed three times with 100 µl<br>
of PBS-Tween per well. Subsequently, a substrate for horseradish peroxidase<br>
(manufactured by BioRad) was added in an amount of 100µl/well and allowed to<br>
stand still for 5 minutes, and thereafter, the absorbance of each well at 415 nm was<br>
measured using a microplate reader.<br>
Consequently, the fractions exhibiting high absorbance were collected and<br>
loaded onto two antibody affinity purification columns (Hitrap Protein G column,<br>
column volume: 5 ml, manufactured by Pharmacia). After washing the inside of the<br>
columns with 25 ml of equilibrium buffer (20 mM, sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)<br>
per column, the antibody was eluted using 15 ml of an elution buffer (0.1M<br>
glycine-hydrochloride (pH 2.7)) per column. Each eluate was collected in a test<br>
tube containing 1.125 ml of 1M Tris-hydrochloride (pH 9.0). Immediately after<br>
completion of the elution, the eluate was loaded onto the upper portion of an<br>
ultrafilter of centrifugation-tube form (Centriprep 10 manufactured by Grace Japan)<br>
and centrifuged at 3000 x g at 4°C for 2 hours. After the filtrate collected in the<br>
lower portion of the filter was removed, 15 ml of PBS was added to the upper portion<br>
and again centrifuged at 3000 x g, and 4°C for 2 hours. In all, this operation was<br>
repeated five times. At the 5th time of operation, the centrifugation operation was<br>
performed until the liquid amount in the upper portion of the filter reached 0.5 ml.<br>
The liquid left in the upper portion of the filter was used as a sample of the<br>
anti-human oculospanin antibody.<br>
[Example 6] Cytotoxic activity<br><br>
Antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity was measured as an index of<br>
bioactivity.<br>
The number of human oculospanin expressing cells (Example 3) was counted<br>
by the tryphan blue staining method, the concentration of the cells was adjusted to 1<br>
x 106 cells /ml with RPMI 1640 medium (manufactured by Invitrogen, hereinafter<br>
referred to as the "RPMI medium") containing 10% fetal bovine serum<br>
(manufactured by Moregate).	To the cells, 2.5 µ1 of<br>
bis(acetoxymethyl)2,2':6'2"-terpyridine-6,6"-dicarboxylic acid (BATDA labeling<br>
agent, manufactured by PerkinElmer) was added, stirred well and incubated at 37°C<br>
in 5% carbon dioxide for 30 minutes while mixing at intervals of 15 minutes by<br>
inverting the culture. To the culture medium, 10 ml of the RPMI medium was<br>
added, stirred and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes. This washing operation<br>
was repeated a further two times. The BATDA labeled human oculospanin<br>
expressing cells thus obtained were resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 medium.<br>
An aliquot of 50 µl (5 x 103 cells) of the suspension solution was seeded in each well<br>
of a 96-well round bottom microplate, which was previously prepared by adding a<br>
purified mouse anti-human oculospanin antibody previously adjusted with RPMI<br>
1640 medium to a concentration of 1 µg/ml, or the supernatant of the hybridoma<br>
culture medium, and leaving it stand still at 4°C for 30 minutes. The microplate<br>
was allowed to stand still at 4°C for a further 30 minutes. To a negative control<br>
well there was added either the purified mouse anti-human oculospanin antibody or<br>
RPMI 1640 medium in place of the hybridoma supernatant.<br>
Effector cells were prepared as follows. J774A.1 cells (available from<br>
Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) were cultured in the presence of 100 ng/ml<br>
macrophage colony stimulating factor (manufactured by Sigma) for 3 days. The<br>
number of J774A. 1 cells was counted by the tryphan blue staining method and then<br>
adjusted with RPMI medium to a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml. To each well of<br><br>
the 96-well round-bottom microplate mentioned above, an 100 µl aliquot (1 x 105<br>
cells) of the cells was seeded. The microplate was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5<br>
minutes and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 gas for 4 hours. To a positive control<br>
well, 1% Triton-X-100 was added in place of the effector cells, in order to<br>
completely kill the BATDA-labeled human oculospanin expressing cells. After a 4<br>
hour incubation, 20 µl of the culture supernatant was taken from each well and<br>
transferred to 96-well white plate. To the plate, 200 µl of a europium solution<br>
(manufactured by PerkinElmer) was added. The plate was shaken at room<br>
temperature for 15 minutes and the decomposition of fluorescence with time was<br>
measured.<br>
The rate of cell death induction in each well was calculated based on the<br>
equation below:<br>
Cell death induction rate (%)= (fluorescent count for each test well -<br>
background count for the negative control well)/(the fluorescent count for the<br>
positive control well - background count for the negative control well) xl00.<br>
By comparison with a control containing only RPMI 1640 medium, it was<br>
confirmed that cell death of the human oculospanin expressing cells was induced by<br>
addition of the purified mouse anti-human oculospanin antibody or the hybridoma<br>
supernatant.<br>
[Example 7] Preparation of human oculospanin expressing cells and their<br>
membrane fraction as immunogen and antigen for detecting antibody.<br>
a) Construction of plasmid pEF/DEST51-NM_031945<br>
The NM_031945 cDNA obtained in Example 2a) was cloned into the<br>
pENTR/D-TOPO vector by using the pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kit<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen) in accordance with the protocol provided. The<br>
NM_031945 cDNA was mixed with pENTR/D-TOPO vector having Topoisomerase<br>
bound thereto, in a reaction buffer provided with the kit and incubated at room<br><br>
temperature for 30 minutes. Using the reaction product obtained, Oneshot TOP 10<br>
chemically competent E. coli. (manufactured by Invitrogen) were transformed and<br>
cultured in LB agar medium containing 50 u.g/ml kanamycin. The resulting E. coli<br>
colonies, resistant to kanamycin, were selected and cultured in 1 ml of liquid TB<br>
medium containing 50 u.g/ml of kanamycin at 37°C overnight. The plasmid DNA<br>
was isolated and purified using a Montage Plasmid Miniprep96 Kit (manufactured by<br>
Millipore). Next, the plasmid DNA thus obtained was subjected to a sequencing<br>
reaction performed using a BigDye Terminator v3.0 Cycle Sequencing Ready<br>
Reaction Kit in accordance with the protocol provided, the nucleotide sequence was<br>
analyzed using an ABI PRISM 3100 DNA Analyzer (manufactured by Applied<br>
Biosystem). As a result, it was confirmed that the cDNA (Sequence ID No. 1 of the<br>
sequence listing) having an open reading frame of the nucleotide sequence<br>
represented by Accession No. NM_031945 was integrated in the pENTR/D-TOPO<br>
vector.<br>
Then, the gene was transferred into expression vector pcDNA3.1/DEST40<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen) by use of the GATAWAY™ system. More<br>
specifically, 4 juJ of GATEWAY™ LR Clonase™ Enzyme Mix (manufactured by<br>
Invitrogen), 4 ul of LR Reaction Buffer, 0.3 ug of pENTR/D-TOPO-NM_031945,<br>
0.3 ug of pcDNA3.1/DEST40, were mixed with TE buffer to prepare a 20 ul solution,<br>
which was allowed to react at 25°C for one hour. After completion of the reaction,<br>
2 ul of Proteinase K was added and a reaction was performed at 37°C for 10 minutes.<br>
OneShot TOP 10 Chemically Competent E. coli (manufactured by Invitrogen) were<br>
transfected with the reaction product and cultured on LB agar medium containing 50<br>
ug/ml of ampicillin. The resulting E. coli colonies, resistant to ampicillin, were<br>
selected and incubated in 100 ml of liquid LB medium containing 50 ug/ml of<br>
ampicillin at 37°C overnight.	As a result, plasmid DNA<br><br>
(pcDNA3.1-DEST40-NM_031945) was isolated and purified using the Plasmid<br>
MAXI Kit (manufactured by Qiagen).<br>
Similarly, the gene was transferred to the expression vector pEF/DEST51<br>
(manufactured by Invitrogen) by use of the Gateway™ system. To explain more<br>
specifically, 4 ul of GATEWAY™ LR Clonase™ Enzyme Mix (manufactured by<br>
Invitrogen), 4 ul of LR Reaction Buffer, 0.3 ug of pENTR/D-TOPO-NM_031945<br>
and 0.3 ug of pEF/DEST51 were mixed with TE buffer to prepare a 20 p.1 solution<br>
and allowed to react at 25°C for one hour. After the reaction, 2 ul of proteinase K<br>
was added and allowed to react at 37°C for 10 minutes. OneShot TOP 10<br>
Chemically Competent E. coli (manufactured by Invitrogen) were transformed with<br>
the reaction product obtained and cultured on LB agar medium containing 50 ug/ml<br>
ampicillin. The resulting E. coli colonies, resistant to ampicillin, were selected and<br>
cultured in 100 ml of liquid LB medium, containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin, at 37°C<br>
overnight. As a result, plasmid DNA (pEF-DEST51 -NM_031945) was isolated and<br>
purified using the Plasmid MAXI Kit (manufactured by Qiagen).<br>
b) Transfection of BALB-3T3 cells and 293T cells with the plasmid<br>
pEF-DEST51 -NM_031945<br>
BALB-3T3 cells (available from PJKEN, clone A31) were cultured in 330<br>
150 mm cell-culture dishes (culturing area: 148 cm2, manufactured by IWAKI)<br>
containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (hereinafter referred to as the<br>
"DMEM", manufactured by SIGMA) supplemented with 10% bovine serum<br>
(manufactured by GIBCO; hereinafter referred to as "BS") at 37°C in 5% C02 gas up<br>
to a semi-confluent state. Thereafter, the BALB-3T3 cells were transfected with<br>
plasmid pEF-DEST51- NM_031945. The Transfection of BALB-3T3 cells was<br>
performed by lipofection using the Geneporter™ 2 transfection reagent<br>
manufactured by Gene Therapy Systems. More specifically, the cells were washed<br>
once with serum-free medium (DMEM) and 20 ml of the serum-free medium<br><br>
(DMEM) was added. Then, to a 50 ml Falcon tube, 0.6 ml of New DNA diluent<br>
and 24 µg of plasmid DNA (pEF-DEST51-NM_031945) recovered by the<br>
aforementioned method were added and mixed. To another 50 ml Falcon tube, 0.35<br>
ml of a serum free medium (Opti-MEM I, manufactured by GIBCO) and 84 ul of<br>
Geneporter™ 2 Reagent were added and mixed. The DNA solution and the<br>
Geneporter™ 2 solution were mixed and allowed to stand still at room temperature<br>
for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the solution mixture of DNA-Geneporter™ 2 was<br>
added to the cells (1 ml/dish) and cultured at 37°C in 5% C02. After 3 hours, the<br>
medium was replaced with 20 ml of DMEM containing 10% bovine serum per dish<br>
and cultured at 37°C overnight in 5% C02.<br>
Furthermore, plasmid pEF-DEST51- NM_031945 was introduced in 293 T<br>
cells as follows. Introduction into the 293T cells was performed by using<br>
LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 reagent (manufactured by Invitrogen). The 293T cells<br>
were seeded at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells/9.2 cm2 and cultured at 37°C overnight in<br>
5% CO2. In a 5 ml polypropylene tube, 10 µl of LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 reagent<br>
and 250 µl of OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (manufactured by Invitrogen)<br>
were mixed and allowed to react with each other at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
In another 5 ml polyethylene tube, 4 µg of plasmid (pEF-DEST51- NM_031945) and<br>
250 µl of OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium were mixed. The<br>
LIPOFECTAMINE solution and the DNA solution were mixed and allowed to react<br>
with each other at room temperature for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed<br>
from the 293T cells cultured overnight and an antibiotic-free Dulbecco's Modified<br>
Eagle medium (manufactured by Gibco) containing 10% fetal calf serum<br>
(manufactured by Moregate) was added to the cells in an amount of 2 ml/9.2 cm .<br>
The LIPOFECTAMINE-DNA solution mixture was added to the 293T cells and<br>
incubated at 37°C in 5% C02 gas for 2 days.<br>
c) Preparation of the cell membrane fraction (10 Liter)<br><br>
The cells cultured by the aforementioned method were washed with a PBS (-)<br>
buffer solution (manufactured by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd). The cells<br>
were collected using a cell scraper (manufactured by IWAKI) and suspended in 230<br>
ml of a 5 mM Tris buffer solution, pH 7.4. The resulting cell solution was allowed<br>
to stand still at 4°C for 30 minutes. The cells were crushed using a Dounce Type B<br>
homogenizer (50 strokes) and centrifuged at 1000G for 10 minutes. The<br>
supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 1,000G for 10 minutes using an<br>
ultracentrifugation apparatus (manufactured by KUBOTA) and the supernatant was<br>
recovered.<br>
The supernatant was centrifuged at 78,000G for 100 minutes using an<br>
ultracentrifugation apparatus (manufactured by BECKMAN) and the precipitate was<br>
recovered. To the precipitate, 14 ml of 57% sucrose in Tris buffer was superposed<br>
and subjected to sugar density gradient at 78,000G for 16 hours at 4°C. As a result,<br>
the membrane fragment of the upper layer was recovered. To the membrane<br>
fraction, 55 ml of 5 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, was added and centrifuged at 78,000G<br>
for 60 minutes at 4°C. The precipitate was recovered. To the precipitate, 1500 µl<br>
of 5 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, was added and then the cell solution was homogenized<br>
by the Dounce type B homogenizer (10 strokes). The membrane fraction was<br>
identified using a Western blotting method described in the Section "Confirmation of<br>
expression".<br>
[Example 8] Immunization of mouse and cell fusion<br>
a) Immunization<br>
lxlO7 cells of the human oculospanin gene expressing cells obtained in<br>
Example 7 were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c female mice which were 5<br>
weeks old (purchased from Japan SLC Inc.) After 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks, the human<br>
oculospanin gene expressing cells (lxlO7 cells/mouse) were injected<br>
intraperitoneally as a booster in the same manner.<br><br>
b) Cell fusion<br>
The spleen was excised out from a mouse on the fourth day after the booster<br>
immunization and added to 10 ml of a serum-free MEM medium (9.4 g/L, Eagle<br>
MEM medium "Nissui"(l): manufactured by Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,<br>
hereinafter referred to as "serum-free MEM medium") containing 10 mM HEPES<br>
buffer (pH 7.4), 0.02 mg/1 sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 300 µg/ml L-glutamic<br>
acid, and then the spleen cells were withdrawn using a 21G' syringe and tweezers.<br>
The cell suspension solution was centrifuged to precipitate the spleen cells. The<br>
spleen cells were washed twice with the serum-free MEM medium and suspended in<br>
serum-free MEM medium and the number of cells was counted.<br>
Myeloma cells SP2/0 were cultured in myeloma growth medium (hereinafter<br>
referred to as the "ME medium") containing 15% FBS (manufactured by GIBCO),<br>
306 µg/ml glutamic acid, and 0.05 mM P-mercaptoethanol at 37°C in the presence of<br>
7% carbon dioxide gas such that the cell density did not exceed 1 x 106 cells/ml.<br>
The myeloma cells SP2/0 thus cultured were washed with the serum-free MEM<br>
medium and suspended in serum-free MEM medium and the number of cells was<br>
counted.<br>
The SP2/0 cell suspension solution containing cells, the number of which<br>
corresponded to about 1/5 of the spleen cells, and the suspension solution for the<br>
whole spleen cells were mixed. After centrifugation, the supernatant was<br>
completely removed. The cell fusion operation below was performed while<br>
keeping a plastic centrifuge tube containing the pellet at room temperature. To the<br>
pellet, 1 ml of 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (manufactured by Merck) was<br>
slowly added while shaking the centrifuge tube. Thereafter, 9 ml of serum-free<br>
MEM medium previously warmed at 37°C was gently added in three times. After<br>
centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and hypoxanthine aminopterin<br>
thymidine medium (hereinafter referred to as the "HAT medium"; manufactured by<br><br>
SIGMA) containing 20% FBS was added using a pipette while gently stirring with<br>
the pipette tip such that the cell density became 2.5x 106 cells/ml. The HAT medium<br>
was dispensed to a 96-well cell-culture microplate in an amount of 100 ul/well and<br>
cultured at 37°C in the presence of 7% carbon dioxide gas. After one day, fresh<br>
HAT medium was added to all the wells in an amount of 100 ul/well and thereafter,<br>
the medium was replaced with fresh medium at intervals of 2 to 3 days. The fused<br>
cells thus obtained were subjected to screening by limiting dilution analysis as<br>
mentioned below.<br>
c)	Limiting dilution<br>
The culture solution containing the fused cells obtained in Section (b) above<br>
was serially diluted such that the density of fused cells in the HAT medium (HT<br>
medium in the case of 2nd cloning or later) became 1 cell/well (10 cells/ml), and 5<br>
cells/well (50 cells/ml). Each of the samples thus prepared was dispensed in an<br>
amount of 100 ul per well, in a 96-well microplate already containing 100 ul of the<br>
HT medium, and the microplates were cultured at 37°C in the presence of 7% carbon<br>
dioxide gas for 10 days.<br>
d)	Screening<br>
d-l)ELISA<br>
The cell membrane fraction obtained in Example 7 was prepared in a solution<br>
of 1 (ag/ml dispensed into a 96-well EIA plate (manufactured by COSTAR) in an<br>
amount of 50 ul/well. After the plate was allowed to stand at 4°C for one day, the<br>
antigen solution within the plate was discarded by shaking well and 80 ul of a<br>
solution containing 1% BSA in PBS(-) was added per well. The plate was sealed and<br>
stored at 4°C until use. When used, the plate was returned to room temperature and<br>
washed three times using a Serawasher (manufactured by Bio-Tec) through which<br>
PBS (PBS-T) containing 0.1% Tween 20 was supplied. As a primary antibody, 50 ul<br>
of cell culture supernatant obtained after 10 to 12 days of cell fusion<br><br>
was added to each well and allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour.<br>
After completion of the reaction with the primary antibody, the plate was washed<br>
three times with PBS-T and alkaline phosphatase labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody<br>
(manufactured by BIO SOURCE), diluted 5000 fold with a solution (antigen dilution<br>
solution) containing 0.5% BSA added to PBS-T, was added to the wells in an amount<br>
of 50 ul/well, and allowed to stand still at room temperature for one hour. After<br>
completion of the reaction with the secondary antibody, a color-emitting substrate for<br>
alkaline phosphatase, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 2Na6H2O (pNPP, manufactured by<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) returned to room temperature was dissolved to<br>
a concentration of 1 mg/ml in pNPP Buffer (97 ml/1 diethanolamine, 0.1 g/1<br>
MgCl2-6H20, pH 9.8) and added to the wells in an amount of 100 µl/well. The<br>
absorbance was measured at 405 run and 630 nm using a plate reader (manufactured<br>
by Nalgene Nunc International)<br>
d-2) Flow cytometry<br>
HEK293 culture cells obtained in Example 7 were cultured in DMEM<br>
medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2 gas. After transfection, the cells<br>
were cultured for 24 hours and a cell suspension solution was prepared so as to<br>
contain 2 x 107 cells/ml. The cell suspension solution was dispensed into 96-well<br>
V-shape bottom microplates (manufactured by Corning) in an amount of 50 µl/well<br>
and subjected to centrifugation (1000 x g, 20°C for 5 minutes). The supernatant<br>
was removed and the supernatant of the fused cells cultured in step (c) above was<br>
added at an amount of 50 ul/well, stirred, allowed to stand still on ice for 0.75 hours,<br>
centrifuged (1000 x g, 20°C for 5 minutes), and then the supernatant was removed.<br>
The pellet was washed twice with a flow cytometry buffer solution (MEM containing<br>
5% FBS) in an amount of 150 µl/well. Thereafter, to the pellet, 100 µl of 33-fold<br>
diluted rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical<br>
Industries Ltd.) labeled with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (hereinafter referred to as<br><br>
"FITC") was added as a secondary antibody, allowed to stand still on ice for 0.75<br>
hours, and subjected to centrifiigation (1000 x g, 20°C for 5 minutes). The<br>
supernatant was removed, the pellet was washed twice with flow cytometry buffer<br>
using 150 µl/well and suspended in the flow cytometry buffer in an amount of 500<br>
µl/well. This was used as a sample for flow cytometry. In each sample, the<br>
intensity of FITC fluorescence emitted from cells was measured by flow cytometry<br>
(FC500, manufactured by BECKMAN) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a<br>
detection wavelength of 530 nm. As a result, the fused cells were selected from the<br>
sample exhibiting higher FITC fluorescent intensity than those of HEK293 transient<br>
expressing cells to which the supernatant of the fusion cell culture was not added.<br>
e) Cloning<br>
The cells selected in the step (d) above were subjected twice to the operations<br>
of a series of steps c) to d). As a result, several hybridoma clones were obtained<br>
which produced a monoclonal antibody which binds to HEK293 transient expressing<br>
cells, but does not bind to cells into which the anti-human oculospanin expression<br>
plasmid has not been introduced. One of the hybridoma strains thus cloned was<br>
designated as 03B8-2C9-4F3 and deposited at the International Patent Organism<br>
Depositary of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science Technology as of<br>
February 17, 2004 under deposition No. FERM BP-08627.<br>
[Example 9] Purification of anti-human oculospanin monoclonal antibody<br>
The mouse-mouse hybridoma prepared in Example 8 was suspended in HY<br>
medium at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml and allowed to stand still at 37°C in<br>
the presence of 7% carbon dioxide for 3 days. The culture solution thus obtained<br>
was centrifuged at 1,600 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was recovered and<br>
IgG was roughly purified as follows:<br>
Binding buffer: pH 7.0 (20 mM Na2HP0412H20, 20 mM Na2HP04-2H20)<br>
Elution buffer: pH 3.0, 100 mM glycine-HCl<br><br>
Neutralization buffer: pH 9.0, 1M Tris-HCl<br>
A requisite aliquot of Protein G carrier (manufactured by Amersham<br>
Biosciences) was taken. After ethanol was removed, the protein G carrier aliquot<br>
was washed twice with ultra pure water and washed once with the binding buffer.<br>
The binding buffer was added to the protein G aliquot carrier to make a 50% gel<br>
slurry. The protein G gel slurry was added to the supernatant of the hybridoma.<br>
The resulting mixture was rotated at 4°C for 24 hours and washed three times with<br>
the binding buffer. After washing, the elution buffer was added to allow antibody<br>
to elute. The eluate was received by a tube containing neutralization buffer in an<br>
amount of 1/10 of the elution buffer. The eluate was loaded onto the upper portion<br>
of an ultrafilter of a sample tube (Amicon Ultrafree-MC: manufactured by Millipore)<br>
and centrifuged at 5000 x g, 4°C for 20 minutes. While the filtrate collected in the<br>
lower portion of the filter was removed, the eluate was added such that the liquid<br>
amount in the upper portion of the filter was at least 50 ul. After the whole amount<br>
of eluate was added, PBS (-) was added in the volume 3 times as large as the eluate.<br>
In this manner, buffer exchange was performed. The liquid left in the upper portion<br>
of the filter was treated as the anti-human oculospanin antibody sample.<br>
[Example 10] Cytotoxic activity<br>
As an index of biological activity, antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity was<br>
measured. The number of the human oculospanin expressing cells prepared in<br>
Example 7 was counted by the tryphan blue staining method and thereafter the<br>
concentration of the cells was adjusted with RPMI 1640 medium (manufactured by<br>
Invitrogen, hereinafter referred to as "RPMI medium") containing 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum (manufactured by Moregate) to 8 x 105 cells/0.4 ml. Then 40 µl of<br>
Chromium-51 (sodium chromate manufactured by Amersham Bioscience) was added<br>
to the cells, the cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 2 hours. To the cells, 8<br>
ml of RPMI medium was added, stirred and then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5<br><br>
minutes. This washing operation was repeated further twice. The Chromium-51<br>
labeled human oculospanin expressing cells thus obtained were resuspended in 4 ml<br>
of RPMI medium and seeded in a 96-well round bottom plate, in which 50 µ1 of 5<br>
µl/ml purified mouse anti-human oculospanin antibody adjusted with RPMI medium<br>
was already present, in an amount of 50 µ1 (1 x 104 cells) per well and allowed to<br>
stand still at 4°C for 30 minutes. In a negative control well or background<br>
measurement well, RPMI medium was added in place of the purified mouse<br>
anti-human oculospanin antibody.<br>
Effector cells were prepared as mentioned below. The spleen cells were<br>
taken from BALB/c-nu/nu mouse (female, 7 weeks old) in accordance with the<br>
customary method. Then, the cell number was counted by the tryphan blue staining<br>
method, the concentration of the cells was adjusted with RPMI medium to 1.5 xlO7<br>
cells/ml. The cells were seeded into 96-well round bottom microplates in an<br>
amount of 100 u.1 (1.5 xlO6 cells/ml) per well, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 minutes<br>
and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 hours. To the positive control well, 2%<br>
Triton-X-100 was added in place of the effector cells in order to completely kill the<br>
Chromium-51 labeled human oculospanin expressing cells. To the background<br>
measurement well, the RPMI medium was added in place of the effector cells.<br>
Next, incubation was performed for 4 hours, 50 µl of the culture supernatant was<br>
taken from each of the wells and transferred to a 96-well Luma Plate (manufactured<br>
by PerkinElmer). The plate was dehydrated at 50°C overnight, the amount of<br>
Chromium-51 in each well was measured by a microplate scintillation counter<br>
(TopCourt NTX, manufactured by PerkinElmer).<br>
The rate at which cell death was induced in each well was calculated in<br>
accordance with the following formula:<br><br>
Cell death induction rate (%) = (radioactivity count for each test well -<br>
background count for the negative control well)/(the radioactivity count for the<br>
positive control well - background count for the negative control well) x 100<br>
Compared to the negative control, it was confirmed that addition of the<br>
purified mouse anti-human oculospanin antibody (Figure 5) induced cell death in the<br>
human oculospanin expressing cells.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
By virtue of the present invention, it was found that the expression level of<br>
human oculospanin in melanoma is significantly high. According to the present<br>
invention, there are provided a method of detecting cancer using the human<br>
oculospanin gene and a cancer detection kit, and further provided an antibody having<br>
cytotoxic activity against oculospanin expressing cells and a pharmaceutical<br>
composition for treating cancer containing the antibody.<br>
