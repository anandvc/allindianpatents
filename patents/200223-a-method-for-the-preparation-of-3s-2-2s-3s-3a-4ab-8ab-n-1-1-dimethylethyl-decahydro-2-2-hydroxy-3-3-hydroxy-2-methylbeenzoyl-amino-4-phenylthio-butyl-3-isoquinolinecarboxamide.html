Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to chemical methods of preparing intermediates in the synthesis of the protease inhibitor nclfmavir mesylate and its free base, which is useful for treatment of HIV infected individuals.<br>
Related Background Art<br>
Treatment of HIV-infected individuals with HFV-protease inhibitors has emerged as an important method for preventing or inhibiting the rapid proliferation of the virus in human tissue. HFV-protease inhibitors block a key enzymatic pathway in the virus resulting in substantially decreased viral loads, which slows the steady decay of the immune system and its resulting deleterious effects on human health. The HIV-protease inhibitor nelfinavir mesylate has shown to be an effective treatment for HIV-infectcd individuals. Nelfinavir<br>

mesylate, and a method for its preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,484,926, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Other procedures for the preparation of nelfmavir mesylate and its free base have been reported. For example, PC17JP96/02756 (WO97/11937) discloses the preparation of nelfmavir mesylate and its free base using oxazoline intermediates, which may be obtained from a l,3-dioxepan-5-ol, or a derivative thereof. PCT/JP96/02757 (WO97/11938) discloses a related method, wherein the l,3-dioxepan-5-ol is converted to nelfinavir mesylate and its free base via N-benzyloxycarbonyl-amino-butane diol intermediates. Each of these methods reportedly provide some improvement in the efficiency of the preparation of nelfinavir. However, further improvement would be desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to efficient and cost-effective methods for the preparation of nelfinavir mesylate and its free base. Specifically, the methods of this invention comprise the preparation of an oxazoline,<br><br>
from a tetrahydrofuran<br><br><br>
-3-<br>
comprising treating the tetrahydrofuran, wherein Ra is -COR(l) and Rb is hydrogen, -COR(3), -SO2R(2) or a suitable hydroxyl protecting group, with an oxophilic electrophilic reagent in a manner that is effective to provide the oxazoline, wherein Rb is hydrogen, -C0R(3), -SO2R(2) or a suitable hydroxyl protecting group and Rc is H, -COR(3) or -SO2R(2); wherein R(l), R(2) and R(3) independently represent a substituted or unsubstiruted alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl group. Advantageously, the methods of this invention provide nelfinavir mesylate and its free base in relatively high yield and employ fewer synthetic steps than the prior art methods.<br>
This invention also relates to methods for making intermediate compounds that are useful in the method of preparation of nelfinavir mesylate and its free base. In addition, this invention relates to methods for the preparation of chiral starting materials that are useful in the methods for the preparation of nelfina.vir mesylate and its free base according to this invention.<br>

In general terms, the conversion of a tetrahydrofuran, I, to an oxazoline, II, may be conducted by treatment of the tetrahydrofuran, wherein Ra is -COR(l) and Rb is hydrogen, -COR(3), -SO2R(2) or a suitable hydroxy! protecting group, with an oxophilic electrophilic reagent that facilitates tetrahydrofuran ring-opening to provide the oxazoline, wherein Rb is hydrogen, -COR(3), -SO2R(2) or a suitable hydroxyl protecting group and R,. is hydrogen, -C0R(3) or -SO2R(2). Accordingly, the hydroxyl protecting groups that may be suitable for use in the method of this invention (as Rb) include those hydroxyl protecting groups that are stable to the oxophilic electrophilic reagents or reagent combinations described herein. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and de-protecting hydroxyl substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art; examples of which may be found in T. Green &amp; P. Wuts, supra.<br>
Typically, the first step in the method of this invention comprises the formation of the chiral tetrahydrofuran amide, B, from the known amino-tetrahydrofuran, A, using any suitable, conventional procedure. Examples of such conventional procedures maybe found<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
in T. Green &amp; P. Wuts, supra, and include treatment with a suitable acid halide, R(1)COX, in the presence of a base, where X is a halogen, treatment with a suitable acid, R(1)COOH, in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent, e.g. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and the like. Preferably, this reaction is conducted using an acid'chloride in the presence of triethylamine base.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the hydroxyl moiety of the chiral tetrahydrofuran amide, B, may be substituted by Rb, where Rb is -SO2R(2) or a suitable protecting group, as defined above. Preferably, the hydroxyl moiety is converted to an alkyl or arylsulfonate (-SO2R(2)), more preferably, a mesylate or tosylate. The methods for forming such -OSO2R(2) groups are well know in the art and may be accomplished using any suitable conventional procedure. Examples of such conventional procedures may also be found in T. Green &amp; P. Wuts, supra. Preferably, this reaction is conducted using methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine base.<br><br>
This hydroxy-substituted, chiral tetrahydrofuran amide, C, may then be converted to a chiral oxazoline, D. This conversion may be conducted using an oxophilic electrophilic reagent that facilitates tetrahydrofuran ring-opening and oxazoline ring-formation. As used herein the term "oxophilic electrophilic reagent" refers to a single reagent, or a set of reagents which when combined generate an oxophilic electrophilic intermediate, which facilitates tetrahydrofuran ring-opening and oxazoline ring-formation. Examples of oxophilic electrophilic reagents include, but are not limited to, suitable oxophilic Lewis acids (for<br><br>
-10-<br>
example, metal halide Lewis acids, such as titanium tetrachloride, or strong oxophilic protic acids, such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (triflic acid)), a suitable acid anhydride, a combination of a suitable acid anhydride or a suitable acid halide with a suitable Lewis acid. Suitable anhydrides and acid halides include the anhydrides and acid halides (e.g., acid chlorides) of any conventional alkyl or aryl carboxylic or sulfonic acid as well as anhydrides of strong acids, for example, triflic anhydride. Suitable Lewis acids include well-known metal halide Lewis acids, such as titanium tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride and the like, and strong protic acids, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and the like. Generally, the reaction of the tetrahydrofuran-amide with an oxophilic electrophilic reagent to form the oxazoline may be conducted at a temperature of between -40°C and 70°C in aprotic solvents, including, but not limited to ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, dichloromethane, benzene and toluene, using about 1 to about 20 molar equivalents of the oxophilic electrophilic reagent (relative to the tetrahydrofuran-amide).<br>
In the course of this reaction, the primary hydroxyl moiety formed on opening of the tetrahydrofuran may become substituted with the "cationic"moiety of the acid used in the reaction. When employing a Lewis acid or a strong protic acid as the oxophilic electrophilic reagent, the resulting oxazoline contains an unsubstituted primary hydroxyl moiety (where R
For the preparation of nelfmavir and nelfinavir mesylate, the tetrahydrofuran amide is preferably converted to an oxazoline-ester derivative by treatment with an oxophilic electrophilic reagent comprising a suitable anhydride, for example, triflic anhydride, or with a combination of an anhydride or acid halide with a Lewis acid. Such reagents are capable of generating acylium ion intermediates and are well known in the art. For example, a suitable acylium intermediate may be prepared in situ by treatment of a suitable acid anhydride, optionally with a suitable protic acid, or by treatment of a suitable acid halide with a suitable<br><br>
-11-<br>
Lewis acid. Suitable acid anhydrides, acid halides and Lewis acids are as described hereinabove. In the course of the reaction employing these reagents, the primary hydroxyl moiety formed on opening of the tetrahydrofuran becomes substituted with the alkyl or aryl carboxyl moiety of the anhydride or acid halide (illustrated as R^ above, where Rc is -C0R(3), as defined above) used in the reaction. As exemplified herein, a useful oxophilic electrophilic reagent combination is comprised of acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid. Accordingly, in this embodiment of the method of this invention, the resulting oxazoline contains an acetylated primary hydroxyl moiety.<br>
Generally, conversion of the tetrahydrofuran-amide to the oxazoline may be accomplished using an excess molar equivalent amount of each reagent of an oxophilic electrophilic reagent combination. This reaction may be conducted at a temperature of between -40°C and 70°C in aprotic solvents, including, but not limited to ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, dichloromethane, benzene and toluene, using about 1 to about 20 molar equivalents of a suitable acid and about 1 to about 20 molar equivalents of a suitable anhydride (relative to the tetrahydrofuran-amide) and using the acid anhydride and acid in a relative molar ratio of from about 1:5 to about 5:1 (anhydride:acid). Preferably, the conversion may be accomplished using an excess molar equivalent amount of the oxophilic electrophilic reagent, i.e., at least 2 to about 20 molar equivalents of the oxophilic electrophilic reagent. More preferably, the reaction may be conducted using about 2 to about 20 molar equivalents of acid and about 2 to about 20 molar equivalents of a suitable anhydride, wherein the ratio of anhydride to acid is from about 1:1 to about 5:1. For example, as exemplified herein, the conversion may be accomplished using 7.5 equivalents of a strong acid and 15 equivalents of an acid anhydride (i.e., wherein the ratio of anhydride to acid is 2:1 (in the range of from about 1.5:1 to about 3:1).<br>
As described in PCT/JP96/02756 (WO97/11937), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, the resulting oxazoline, D, may be used for the preparation of intermediates, useful in the preparation of nelfinavir, especially Compounds 20 and 19,<br><br>

that are especially useful in the preparation of nelfinavir mesylate and nelfinavir free base. Particularly useful intermediates are Compounds 19' and 20'. As illustrated below, these compounds maybe prepared from chiral tetrahydrofuran Compounds I1 or 2Compound 18' may be prepared by the reaction sequence illustrated in Scheme I,<br>
25       below. In this embodiment of the method of this invention, chiral amino-tetrahydrofuran, I1, is treated with 3-acetoxy-2-methylbenzoyl chloride (AMBC) under conditions effective to form an amide, (12-acetoxy-3-methyl benzamide, 2') or a salt thereof. The resulting amide, tetrahydrofuran-amide, 2', may be treated with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as, for example, triethylamine, under conditions effective to derivatize the<br>
30       secondary alcohol of tetrahydrofuran-amide, 2', providing an intermediate mesylate<br>
tetrahydrofuran amide-sulfonate, 3', which need not be isolated. For example, this reaction<br><br>
-37-<br>
may be conducted by first treating tetrahydrofuran 2' with at least one molar equivalent of methanesulfonyl chloride, followed by addition of less than a molar equivalent amount (with respect to the amount of methanesulfonyl chloride) of triethylaminc. Tetrahydrofuran amide-sulfonate, 3', may then be treated with an anhydride, such as, for example/acetic anhydride, and a strong acid, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, under conditions effective to produce Compound 18'. For example, tetrahydrofuran amide-sulfonate, 3', may be treated with 15 molar equivalents of acetic anhydride and 7.5 molar equivalents of a strong acid, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, to produce Compound 18'. Other strong acids useful in this treatment step include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
10<br>
Scheme I<br><br>
It is considered within the ordinary skill of one in the art through routine 15       experimentation to determine the reaction conditions (solvent, reaction time, temperature, etc.) that are effective to produce all of the compounds, described herein. For example, the<br><br>
-38-<br>
above-describcd reactions for the conversion of amino-tetrahydrofuran, I1, to Compound 19', using the moisture-sensitive acid chloride, AMBC, and sulfonyl chloride, mesylchloride, would preferably be conducted in an aprotic solvent (i.e., one that is not water or an alcohol). Preferably, the aprotic solvent is an aprotic solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, 5       toluene, benzene and the like.<br>
The preparation of Compound 20', as illustrated in the reaction sequence of Scheme II, below, may also be prepared from the amino-tetrahydrofuran, 1', or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. As in the above-described reaction sequence, the first step of this sequence involves the formation of the amide intermediate, tetrahydrofuran-amide, 2'. This<br>
10      amide intermediate may be treated directly with an anhydride, such as, for example, acetic<br>
anhydride, and a strong acid, such as, for example, sulfuric acid, to form oxazoline triester, 4". Each of the acetoxy moieties of oxazolinc triestcr, 4r, may be removed (hydrolyzcd to the corresponding hydroxyl moieties), by treatment with a suitable base in a suitable solvent, to form the oxazoline triol, 5'. Bases that are suitable for effecting this hydrolysis are known in<br>
15       the art and include potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and the<br>
like. Solvents that are suitable for effecting this hydrolysis are similarly known in the art and include lower alkanols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.).<br>
Advantageously, the phenolic, primary and secondary hydroxyl moieties of oxazoline triol, 5' may be selectively protected, as illustrated below. For example, the phenolic<br>
20       hydroxyl moiety may be protected as the p-nitrobenzoatc, Compound 6', using p-nitrobenzoyl chloride. The primary hydroxyl moiety of Compound 6' may then be selectively protected using the same or a different protecting group. Alternatively, both the phenolic and primary hydroxyl moieties of oxazoline triol, 5', may be protected using p-nitrobenzoyl chloride to form the di-p-nitrobenzoate, Compound 7'. This process may be conducted in a single step,<br>
25       using two equivalents of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, or in a stepwise process, as described above.<br><br>

As illustrated in Scheme HI, treating Compound T with methanesulfonyl chloride (although another substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl sulfonyl chloride may be used) in the presence of a base, such as, for example, triethylamine, provided Compound 8', which may be converted into Compound 20' by addition of 3S,4aR,8aR-3-N-t-butylcarboxamidodecahydroisoquinoline (PHIQ) in the presence of potassium carbonate and methanol. Further treatment with thiophenol provided nelfmavir. Treatment of Compound T with the sulfonyl chloride and base may be conducted using conventional conditions.<br><br><br>

Scheme IU<br>
An alternative reaction sequence for preparing Compound 19' beginning with the formation of tetrahydrofuran-amide, 2', from amino-tetrahydrofuran, I1, comprises the formation of the fused tetrahydrofuranyloxazoline, 91, as illustrated in Scheme IV, below. Treatment of the tetrahydrofuran-amide, 2\ with methanesulfonyl chloride (although another substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl sulfonyl chloride may be used) in the presence of a base, such as, for example, triethylamine, provides the novel fused<br><br>
-41-<br>
tetrahydrofuranyloxazoline, 9'. Acid treatment of this oxazoline provides the tetrahydrofuran-amide, 10', wherein the stereochemistry of the 4-hydroxyl moiety is opposite that of the starting tetrahydrofuran, 2'. Treatment of the tetrahydrofuran-amide, 10', with acetic anhydride in the presence of a strong acid, such as sulfuric or nitric acid, affords Compound 11', a triacetate. Hydrolysis of this triacetate provides triol, 12'.<br>
Scheme IV<br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme V, treatment of triol 12' with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride or 10       another substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as, for example, triethylamine, provides the primary tosylate, Compound 13'. Treatment with this tosylate with a nucleophile, 3S,4aR,8aR-3-N-t-<br><br>
-42-<br>
butylcarboxamidodecahydroisoquinoline (PHIQ) in the presence of a base, under conventional conditions, provides Compound 19'. Conversion of Compound 19' into nelfinavir can be accomplished, under conventional conditions, for example, by treatment with thiophenol.<br>
Scheme V<br><br>
Another embodiment of this invention, illustrated in Scheme VI, provides for the preparation of amino alcohol, 1, from fused epoxy-tetrahydrofuran, 14, Treatment of 1 with (S)-a-methylbenzyl amine, or another chiral amine, containing at least 97.5% of a single enantiomer, results in the opening of the epoxide to provide a mixture of diastereomeric Compounds 15' and 16'. This reaction may be conducted using an appropriate solvent such as a mixture of isopropyl amine and water. Crystallization of the diastereomers selectively provides Compound 15'. De-protection of the benzyl moiety of Compound 15' may be conducted using conventional procedures, e.g. hydrogenolysis (hydrogen in the presence of 5% palladium on carbon). The amino-alcohol, 1, is hygroscopic and is preferably isolated as a salt, for example, as the p-toluenesulfcnic acid salt, 17.<br><br><br>
-43-<br>
Schcme VI<br>
Alternatively, the chiral amino-tctrahydiofiiran, 1, maybe prepared from the fused epoxy-tctrahydrofuran, 14, using aqueous ammonia, an achiral reagent, to provide a mixture of racemic 1 and V, which may be resolved using conventional resolution techniques, as illustrated in Scheme VH For example, the racemic amino-compound may be treated with a chiral acid to form a mixture of diastereomcric salts, which may then be separated by crystallization or chromatography. Neutralization and extractive work-up provides diastereomerically pure amino-tetrahydrofuran, I, and recovery of the chiral acid.<br><br>
