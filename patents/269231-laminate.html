DESCRIPTION LAMINATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a laminate. More specifically, it relates to a laminate comprising an acrylic resin layer (first layer) and an organosiloxane resin composition (second layer) , all of which are formed on a base in the mentioned order and having excellent weatherability.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE ART<br>
Plastic materials are used in a wide variety of fields, making use of their impact resistance, lightweight and processability. Especially acrylic resin, polycarbonate resin and styrene-based resin which are transparent plastics are widely used as substitutes for glass. However, as these resins are unsatisfactory in terms of weatherability, it is known that when they are used outdoors for a long time, they decompose or deteriorate, thereby impairing their physical properties and appearances. Further, they have such defects that their surfaces are apt to be scratched due to their low abrasion resistance and affected by a solvent.<br>
In recent years, there has been a trend toward the use of organic glass comprising a transparent plastic as a base in a windowpane, especially a car windowpane, making use of its lightweight and safety. Weatherability as high as that of glass is required for this organic glass. Since it is necessary to prevent the scratching of a windshield during the operation of a wiper and the scratching of a side window during the vertical movement of the window, excellent abrasion resistance is required.<br>
To improve the weatherability and abrasion resistance of the organic glass, there have been made a large number<br><br>
of proposals for using an organosiloxane resin layer on the surface of a base. For example, patent document 1 and patent document 2 disclose a resin composition which contains a trihydroxysilane partial condensate and colloidal silica. Further, patent document 3 and patent document 4 disclose a resin composition which contains a condensate of an alkyltrialkoxysilane and a tetraalkoxysilane and colloidal silica.<br>
Although cured films of these resin compositions have a certain measure of abrasion resistance, the cured films are pulled due to a difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the base and the cured films in a high-temperature environment and may crack. Therefore, they have a problem with durability.<br>
To improve this, there have been made proposals for forming a thermosetting acrylic resin layer between the base and the organosiloxane resin layer. For example, patent document 5 proposes the use of an acryl-urethane resin layer which is obtained from an acrylic polyol and an isocyanate compound as the thermosetting acrylic resin layer. However, as the isocyanate compound has high reactivity, the storage stability of the obtained coating composition is low and the viscosity of the composition increases during use or storage, whereby it is apt to gel. Moreover, a side reaction readily occurs at the time of thermal curing.<br>
Patent document 6 and patent document 7 propose the use of a vinyl-based copolymer containing an alkoxysilyl group as the thermosetting acrylic resin layer. However, as the alkoxysilyl group gradually reacts with water contained in the composition to be hydrolyzed and condensed, the composition becomes viscous and gels.<br>
Patent document 8 discloses a resin composition which contains an alkylcyclohexylalkyl ester of (meth) acrylic acid as an essential component. The weatherability of this resin<br><br>
composition is not satisfactory and there is room for improvement.<br>
Meanwhile, to improve weatherability, there is known a method in which an ultraviolet absorber is added to the thermosetting acrylic resin layer. For example, patent document 9 proposes that a benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorber is added to a thermosetting acrylic resin to improve its weatherability. However, the optical decomposition rate of the ultraviolet absorber itself is high and there is limitation to the long-term suppression of the optical deterioration of the base. When a large amount of the ultraviolet absorber is added to improve this defect, adhesion between the base and the organosiloxane resin layer deteriorates.<br>
A triazine-based ultraviolet absorber is known as an ultraviolet absorber having a low optical decomposition rate. However, when the triazine-based ultraviolet absorber is added to the thermosetting acrylic resin, the obtained cured film is apt to be whitened by its outdoor exposure and its appearance and transparency are easily impaired.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a laminate which has excellent weatherability and abrasion<br><br>
resistance.  It is another object of the present invention to provide a laminate which has excellent adhesion.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have conducted studies to improve the weatherability of a laminate comprising a base, a first layer made of acrylic resin and a second layer made of organosiloxane resin, all of which are formed in the mentioned order.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION <acrylic resin composition><br>
The acrylic resin composition of the present invention comprises (A) an acrylic copolymer, (B) a blocked polyisocyanate compound, (C) a curing catalyst and (D) a triazine-based ultraviolet absorber. A detailed description is given of the components (A) to (D).<br>
(acrylic copolymer (A))<br>
The acrylic copolymer (maybe referred to as "component (A)" hereinafter) contains at least 70 mol% of a recurring unit represented by the following formula (A).<br><br>
In the above formula, X is a hydrogen atom or methyl group. The content of the hydrogen atom in X is 30 mol% or less.<br>
Y is a methyl group, ethyl group, cycloalkyl group, hydroxyalkyl group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms or triazine-based ultraviolet absorber residue. The content of the cycloalkyl group in Y is 1 to 85 mol%. The content of the triazine-based ultraviolet absorber residue is 0 to 15 mol%, and the content of the ethyl group is 1 to 98 mol%.<br>
The acrylic copolymer preferably contains recurring units represented by the formulas (A-1), (A-2), (A-3) and (A-4) . (unit (A-D)<br><br>
In the formula (A-1) , Y’ is a methyl group or ethyl group. The recurring unit represented by the formula (A-1) is obtained by polymerizing methyl methacrylate or ethyl methacrylate. They may be used alone or in combination.<br>
The content of the unit (A-1) in the acrylic copolymer is preferably 1 to 98 mol%. When the content of the unit (A-1) is lower than 1 mol%, the flexibility of the first layer degrades and the second layer is apt to crack. Also, adhesion between the base and the second layer lowers disadvantageously.<br><br>
In the formula (A-2) , X'‘ is a hydrogen atom or methyl group, and Y’ is a cycloalkyl group. The recurring unit represented by the formula (A-2) is obtained by polymerizing an acrylate or methacrylate having at least one cycloalkyl group in the molecule. The number of carbon atoms of the cycloalkyl group is preferably 5 to 12. Specific examples of the cycloalkyl group include cyclohexyl group and cyclooctyl group.<br>
The recurring unit represented by the formula (A-2) can be introduced by copolymer i zing a corresponding monomer. Examples of the corresponding monomer include cyclohexyl acrylate, 4-methylcyclohexyl acrylate, 2,4-dimethylcyclohexyl acrylate, 2,4,6-trimethylcyclohexyl acrylate, 4-t-butylcyclohexyl<br><br>

They may be used alone or in combination of two or more. Out of these, cyclohexyl methacrylate is particularly preferred.<br>
The content of the unit (A-2) in the acrylic copolymer is preferably 1 to 85 mol%. When the content of the unit {A-2) is lower than 1 mol%, the dispersibility of the triazine-based ultraviolet absorber degrades and the first layer is apt to whiten. When the content is higher than 85 mol%, adhesion between the base and the second layer lowers.<br><br>
In the formula (A-3) , X’ is a hydrogen atom or methyl group, and Y’ is an alkylene group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples of the alkylene group include ethylene group, trimethylene group and tetramethylene group. The unit (A-3) has a hydroxyl group.<br>

More specifically, a recurring unit derived from an acrylic monomer represented by the following formula (A-4-a) or (A-4-b) is preferably used.<br><br>

In the present invention, the triazine-based ultraviolet absorber residue is the residue of a triazine-based ultraviolet absorber and has ultraviolet absorptivity. The triazine-based ultraviolet absorber residue strictly differs from a triazine compound in molecular weight because part of the terminal of the triazine compound is missing and the triazine compound is bonded to the acrylic copolymer. However, as the weight of the missing part is very small as compared with the entire weight, the weight of the residue is supposed to be the same as the weight of the triazine compound for the convenience's sake in the present invention.<br>

2-hydroxy-4-(methacryloxyethyl)benzophenone, all of which<br>
are preferred from the viewpoint of adhesion or durability<br>
such as weatherability. They may be used alone or in<br>
combination of two or more. An acrylic resin composed of<br>
a single component does not need to be used alone, and two<br>
or more acrylic resins may be used in combination.<br>
The molecular weight of the acrylic copolymer as the component (A) is preferably 20,000 or more, more preferably 50,000 or more in terms of weight average molecular weight. An acrylic copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 10,000,000 or less is preferably used. Therefore, the weight average molecular weight of the acrylic copolymer is preferably 50,000 to 10,000,000, more preferably 50,000 to<br><br>
1,000,000, much more preferably 50,000 to 500,000. An acrylic copolymer having a molecular weight within the above range is preferred as it exhibits adhesion and strength fully as the first layer.<br>
(blocked polyisocyanate compound (B))<br>
The component (B) is a compound which loses reactivity when a blocking agent is reacted with isocyanate groups to remove most of free isocyanate groups and changes into isocyanate groups to regain reactivity when it is heated to dissociate the blocking agent.<br>
Examples of the component (B) include block isocyanate compounds obtained by adding a blocking agent typified by oximes such as acetoxime and methyl ethyl ketoxime, active methylene compounds such as dimethyl malonate, diethyl malonate, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate and acetyl acetone, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol and 2-ethyl-l-hexanol, and phenols such as phenol, cresol and ethyl phenol to the isocyanate groups of a polyisocyanate compound.<br>
Examples of the polyisocyanate compound to which the blocking agent is added include a polyisocyanate, adduct of a polyhydric alcohol with a polyisocyanate, cyclic polymer of polyisocyanates, and isocyanate-burette form. Examples of the polyisocyanate include tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, tolidine diisocyanate, xylene diisocyanate, lysine diisocyanate, trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate, dimeric acid diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate.<br>
Since the component (B) forms isocyanate groups only at the time of a thermosetting reaction, a coating<br><br>
composition has excellent storage stability, the isocyanate groups are rarely consumed in a side reaction with water contained in the coating composition or in the air and an alcohol solvent used in a solvent coating composition, and a cured film hardly influenced by the coating environment and having stable physical properties can be formed. The block isocyanates may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>
Out of the block isocyanates, blocked aliphatic and/or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds are particularly preferred because they have excellent weatherability. The blocked aliphatic and/or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds are obtained by reacting (i) a hydroxyl compound having 2 to 4 hydroxy groups with an aliphatic and/or alicyclic diisocyanate compound(s). An adduct type polyisocyanate compound obtained by blocking an adduct type polyisocyanate compound with a blocking agent and an isocyanurate type polyisocyanate compound obtained by blocking (ii) an isocyanurate type polyisocyanate compound derived from an aliphatic and/or alicyclic diisocyanate compound(s) with a blocking agent are preferred. Out of these, aliphatic diisocyanate compounds and/or alicyclic diisocyanate compounds having 4 to 2 0 carbon atoms are preferred, and aliphatic diisocyanate compounds and/or alicyclic diisocyanate compounds having 4 to 15 carbon atoms are more preferred. When the number of carbon atoms of the isocyanate compound falls within the above range, a coating film having excellent durability is formed.<br>
The isocyanate group ratio is the percentage of the total weight of the formed isocyanate groups based on the weight of the component (B) when the component (B) is heated to dissociate the blocking agent.<br>
The component (B) has an isocyanate group ratio of 5.5 to 50 wt%, preferably 6.0 to 40 wt%, most preferably 6 .5 to<br><br>
30 wt%. When the isocyanate group ratio is lower than 5.5 wt%, the amount of the blocked polyisocyanate compound based on the acrylic resin becomes large and adhesion to the base becomes unsatisfactory. When the isocyanate group ratio is higher than 50 wt%, the flexibility of the coating layer degrades, the coating layer cracks when the second layer is thermally cured, and durability against environmental changes is impaired. The isocyanate group ratio (wt%) is obtained by ureanating the isocyanate groups with a known amount of amine and titrating excess of amine with an acid.<br>
The content of the component (B) is such that the amount of the isocyanate group is 0.8 to 1.5 equivalents, preferably 0.8 to 1.3 equivalents, most preferably 0.9 to 1.2 equivalents based on 1 equivalent of the hydroxyl group contained in the acrylic copolymer (A).<br>
When the hydroxy group in the component (A) and the isocyanate group in the component (B) are crosslinked by an urethane bond, the first layer retains high adhesion to the base and the second layer. A reduction in crosslinking density by ultraviolet radiation, water or oxygen hardly occurs, and adhesion can be maintained for a long time. Further, durability in a high-temperature environment can be retained. Further, weatherability is excellent.<br>
When the amount of the isocyanate group is smaller than 0.8 equivalent, crosslinking becomes unsatisfactory, wheireby durability in a high-temperature environment becomes low.  Further, as an unreacted hydroxy group exhibits high affinity for a water molecule, it absorbs moisture, whereby weatherability and hot water resistance deteriorate. When the amount of the isocyanate group is larger than 1.5 equivalents, the first layer becomes a hard and fragile layer having very high crosslinking density with an allophanate bond, hardly responds to environmental changes and is inferior in adhesion after an environmental change.<br><br>
(curing catalyst (C))<br>
The component (C) is a curing catalyst. The curing catalyst is used to promote the dissociation of the blocking agent as the component (B) . It is also used to promote an urethanation reaction between the isocyanate group formed by the dissociation and the hydroxy group contained in the component (A).<br>
The component (C) is preferably at least one compound selected from the group consisting of an organic tin compound, organic titanium compound, organic zirconium compound, tertiary amine compound and quaternary ammonium salt compound.<br>
Out of these curing catalysts, an organic tin compound is preferably used, and an organic tin compound represented by the following formula is particularly preferably used.<br>

They may be used alone or in combination of two or more.<br>

by weight, preferably 0.0 02 to 0.3 part by weight based on<br>
10 0 parts by weight of the total of the components (A) and<br>
(B) . When the amount of the component (C) is smaller than<br><br>
0.001 part by weight, the function of promoting a crosslinking reaction is not obtained and when the amount is larger than 0.4 part by weight, adhesion between the first layer and the second layer lowers disadvantageously.<br>
(triazine-based ultraviolet absorber (D))<br>

The component (D) can exhibit an ultraviolet absorption function to the full due to improved dispersibility by the cycloalkyl group contained in the acrylic copolymer as the component (A) .

The contents of the component (E) and the component (F) in the organosiloxane resin composition are determined from the viewpoints of the stability of the organosiloxane resin composition and the transparency, abrasion resistance, scratch resistance, adhesion and the occurrence of cracking of the obtained cured film. As for the preferred mixing ratio of these two components, the content of the component (E) is 10 to 60 wt% and the content of the component (F) is 40 to 90 wt% in terms of R’mR’nSiO(4-m-n)/2 based on 10 0 wt% of the total of the components (E) and (F) .

It is desired that the pH of the organosiloxane resin composition should be set to preferably 3.0 to 6.0, more preferably 4 . 0 to 5.5 by controlling the contents of the acid and the curing catalyst.

In the present invention, the first layer can be formed by applying the acrylic resin composition (coating) to the surface of the base, removing the solvent by heating or the<br><br>
like, and thermally reacting a hydroxyl group with an isocyanate group formed by heating to crosslink (thermally cure) the acrylic resin composition.<br>
For the application of the coating to the base, a suitable coating technique such as bar coating, dip coating, flow coating, spray coating, spin coating or roller coating may be selected according to the shape of the base to be coated. The base to be coated with the acrylic resin composition is generally dried at normal temperature to a temperature lower than the thermal deformation temperature of the base to remove the solvent and thermally cure the acrylic resin composition.<br>
Thermal curing is preferably carried out at a high temperature as long as there is no problem with the heat resistance of the base because curing can be completed quickly. At normal temperature, thermal curing does not proceed completely and a coating layer having sufficiently high crosslinking density required for the first layer cannot be obtained.  In the process of thermal curing, a crosslinkable group contained in the thermosetting acrylic resin composition reacts to increase the crosslinking density of a coating layer, whereby a coating layer having excellent adhesion, hot water resistance and durability in a high-temperature environment is obtained.<br>
The thermal curing temperature is preferably 8 0 to 160°C, more preferably 100 to 140°C, much more preferably 110 to 130°C. The thermal curing time is preferably 10 minutes to 3 hours, more preferably 2 0 minutes to 2 hours. A laminate comprising an acrylic resin layer as the first layer is obtained by crosslinking the crosslinkable group by heating. When the thermal curing time is shorter than 10 minutes, the crosslinking reaction does not proceed fully and a first layer having low durability in a high-temperature environment and low weatherability may be obtained. A<br><br>
thermal curing time of 3 hours or less suffices from the viewpoint of the performance of the acrylic resin composition.<br>
By thermally curing the acrylic resin composition to form the first layer, its adhesion to the second layer and the base becomes high and a laminate having excellent abrasion resistance and weatherability can be obtained.<br>
The thickness of the first layer is preferably 1 to 20 |am, more preferably 2 to 10 |am. When the thickness is smaller than 1 )im, the transmittance of ultraviolet radiation becomes high, thereby causing the yellowing of the base and the deterioration of adhesion with the result of low weatherability. When the thickness of the first layer<br>
becomes larger than 20 (im, a crosslinking reaction does not proceed fully at the time of thermal curing due to an increase in internal stress, whereby a layer having low durability in a high-temperature environment is obtained. Further, the volatilization of the solvent a;t the time of coating the acrylic resin composition becomes unsatisfactory, whereby the solvent remains in the first layer, thereby impairing hot water resistance and weatherability.<br>
(second layer)<br>
The second layer can be formed by applying the organosiloxane resin composition (coating) to the first layer and then thermally curing it. The formation of the second layer is preferably carried out right after the formation of the first layer.<br>
A suitable coating technique such as bar coating, dip coating, flow coating, spray coating, spin coating or roller coating may be selected according to the shape of the base to be coated. After the organosiloxane resin composition is applied, it is generally dried at normal temperature to a temperature lower than the thermal deformation temperature<br><br>
of the base to remove the solvent and thermally cured. Thermal curing is preferably carried out at a high temperature as long as there is no problem with the heat resistance of the base because curing can be completed quickly. At normal temperature, thermal curing does not proceed and a cured film cannot be obtained. This means that an organosiloxane contained in the coating partially condensates. In the process of thermal curing, the condensation reaction of the residual Si-OH occurs, thereby forming a Si-O-Si bond to produce a coating layer having excellent abrasion resistance.<br>
The thermal curing temperature is preferably 5 0 to 200°C, more preferably 80 to 160°C, much more preferably 100 to 140°C. The thermal curing time is preferably 10 minutes to 4 hours, more preferably 20 minutes to 3 hours, much more preferably 3 0 minutes to 2 hours.<br>
The thickness of the second layer is preferably 1 to 20 i’m, more preferably 2 to 10 i’m, much more preferably 3 to 8 |am. When the thickness of the second layer falls within the above range, the cracking of the second layer or the degradation of adhesion between the second layer and the first layer caused by stress generated at the time of thermal curing does not occur, and a second layer having sufficiently high abrasion resistance which is an object of the present invention is obtained.<br>
(leveling agent)<br>
In the present invention, a known leveling agent may be mixed with the coatings for the first layer and the second layer in order to improve coatability and the smoothness of the obtained layer.<br>
Examples of the leveling agent include the SH200-100cs, SH28PA, SH29PA, SH30PA, ST83PA, ST80PA, ST97PA, ST86PA and SH21PA silicone compounds of Toray Dow Corning Silicone Co. ,<br><br>
Ltd., tne KP321, KP322, KP323, KP324, KP326, KP34 0 and KP341 silicone compounds of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. , Ltd., and the F-179, F-812A and F-815 fluorine surfactants of Dainippon Ink &amp; Chemicals, Inc. These leveling agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more. It is used in an amount of preferably 0.0001 to 2.0 parts by weight, more preferably 0.0005 to 1.0 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin.<br>

combination of two or more.<br>
As the polycarbonate precursor is used a carbonyl halide, carbonate ester or haloformate, as exemplified by phosgene, diphenyl carbonate and dihaloformate of a diphenol.<br>
To manufacture a polycarbonate resin by reacting the diphenol with the carbonate precursor by the interfacial polycondensation or melting process, a catalyst, terminal capping agent and antistatic agent for the diphenol may be used as required. The polycarbonate resin may be a branched polycarbonate resin obtained by copolymerizing a polyfunctional aromatic compound having a functionality of 3 or more, or a polyester carbonate resin obtained by copolymerizing an aromatic or aliphatic bifunctional carboxylic acid.  It may also be a mixture of two or more obtained polycarbonate resins.<br>
The molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin is preferably 10, 000 to 50, 000, more preferably 15, 000 to 35, 000 in terms of viscosity average molecular weight (M). A polycarbonate resin having the above viscosity average molecular weight is preferred because it has sufficiently high strength and high melt f lowability at the time of molding. The viscosity average molecular weight as used herein is obtained by inserting a specific viscosity (r|sp) obtained<br><br>
from a solution containing 0.7 g of the polycarbonate resin dissolved in 10 0 ml of methylene chloride at 20°C into the following equation.<br>
Tlsp/c = [r\]   + 0.45 X [r|]’c ( [r\]   is an intrinsic viscosity) [Ti] = 1.23 X lO'V-" c = 0.7<br>
To the polycarbonate resin may be added a stabilizer such as phosphite, phosphate or phosphonate, flame retardant such as tetrabromobisphenol A, a low-molecular weight polycarbonate of tetrabromobisphenol A or decabromodiphenol, colorant, lubricant and other resins such as the above polyester resins and ABS as required.<br>

When the layers formed on the base satisfy the above expressions (1) to (8), a laminate having a high level of weatherability with high light absorptivity and light absorptivity retention is obtained. When the layers satisfy the above expressions (1) to (8) , adhesion between the base and the first layer and adhesion between the first layer and the second layer become excellent, and cracking rarely occurs.<br>

In the laminate of the present invention, protective layers consisting of the first layer and the second layer may be formed on both sides of the base. The laminate whose both sides are protected can be advantageously used in car windowpanes and sunroofs.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
Since the triazine-based ultraviolet absorber is contained in the first layer together with the cycloalkyl group-containing acrylic copolymer, the laminate of the present invention exhibits an excellent ultraviolet absorbing effect and retains the effect stably. Therefore, the laminate of the present invention is excellent in<br><br>
weatherability. When the ultraviolet absorber is contained in the second layer, weatherability is further improved. Since the laminate of the present invention contains an urethane bond in the first layer, it is excellent in adhesion between the base and the second layer and hot water resistance.

(preparation and evaluation of laminate)<br>
The laminate was evaluated by the following methods. Evaluation of appearance:<br>
The appearances (existence of foreign matter and whitening) of coating layers on both sides of a test sample and the existence of a crack were checked with the eyes. Adhesion:<br>
One hundred 1 mm squares were formed on one of the coating layers on both sides with a cutter knife, and an adhesive tape (tradename: Celotape (registered trademark) ) manufactured by Nichiban Co., Ltd. was pressure bonded to these squares and strongly stripped off in a vertical direction to evaluate the adhesion based on the number of squares remaining on the base. Hot water resistance:<br>
Changes in the appearance and adhesion of the coating layer after the test sample was immersed in boiled water for 3 hours or 8 hours were evaluated. Abrasion resistance:<br>
A Taber abrasion test was made on one of the coating layers on both sides at 1,000 rpm under a load of 500 g by using the CS-IOF abrasion wheel of Calibrase Co. Ltd. in accordance with JIS K6735 to measure the difference AH between the haze before the Taber abrasion test and the haze after the Taber abrasion test. The abrasion wheel was refaced at 25 rpm by using the S-11 abrasive paper in place of the AA-4 0 0 abrasive paper.<br>
(haze = Td/Tt x 100, Td: scattered light transmittance, Tt: total light transmittance) high-temperature environment durability:<br>
