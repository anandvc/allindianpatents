				<td>METHOD OF MONITORING MEMBRANE SEPARATION<br>
PROCESSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to membrane separation and, more particularly,<br>
to methods for monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Membrane separation, which uses a selective membrane, is a fairly recent<br>
addition to the industrial separation technology for processing of liquid streams, such as<br>
water purification. In membrane separation, constituents of the influent typically pass<br>
through the membrane as a result of a driving force(s) in one effluent stream, thus<br>
leaving behind some portion of the original constituents in a second stream. Membrane<br>
separations commonly used for water purification or other liquid processing include<br>
microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO),<br>
electrodialysis, electrode ionization, pervaporation, membrane extraction, membrane<br>
distillation, membrane stripping, membrane aeration, and other processes. The driving<br>
force of the separation depends on the type of the membrane separation. Pressure-<br>
driven membrane filtration, also known as membrane filtration, includes<br>
microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, and uses pressure as a<br>
driving force, whereas the electrical driving force is used in electrodialysis and<br>
electrodeionization. Historically, membrane separation processes or systems were not<br>
considered cost effective for water treatment due to the adverse impacts that membrane<br>
scaling, membrane fouling, membrane degradation and the like had on the efficiency of<br>
removing solutes from aqueous water streams. However, advancements in technology<br><br>
have now made membrane separation a more commercially viable technology for<br>
treating aqueous feed streams suitable for use in industrial processes.<br>
Furthermore, membrane separation processes have also been made more<br>
practical for industrial use, particularly for raw and wastewater purification. This has<br>
been achieved through the use of improved diagnostic tools or techniques for<br>
evaluating membrane separation performance. The performance of membrane<br>
separation, such as efficiency (e.g. flux or membrane permeability) and effectiveness<br>
(e.g. rejection or selectivity), are typically affected by various parameters concerning<br>
the operating conditions of the process. Therefore, it is desirable to monitor these and<br>
other types of process parameters specific to membrane separation to assess the<br>
performance of the process and/or the operating conditions. In this regard, a variety of<br>
different diagnostic techniques for monitoring membrane separation processes have<br>
been routinely used and are now understood and accepted as essential to its practicality<br>
and viability for industrial use.<br>
However, monitoring is typically conducted on an intermittent basis, for<br>
example, once a work shift or at times less frequently. Known employed monitoring<br>
techniques can also be labor and time intensive. Thus, adjustments made to membrane<br>
separation processes in order to enhance performance based on typical monitoring may<br>
not be made in an expeditious manner. In addition, the presently available monitoring<br>
techniques often do not provide optimal sensitivity and selectivity with respect to<br>
monitoring a variety of process parameters that are generally relied on as indicators to<br>
evaluate and/or control membrane separation processes.<br>
For example, monitoring techniques typically applied to reverse osmosis and<br>
nanofiltration include conductivity measurements and flow measurements.<br><br>
Conductivity measurements are inherently less accurate in order to determine the<br>
recovery of solutes which are substantially retained by the membrane. In this regard,<br>
conductive salts, typically used as indicators during conductive measurements, can<br>
pass through the membrane. Since salts generally pass through the membrane as a<br>
percentage of the total salt concentration, changes in local concentration due to<br>
concentration gradients or the like can change the conductivity of the product water<br>
without necessarily indicating membrane damage. This is especially true in the last<br>
stage of a multi-stage cross flow membrane system where salt concentrations (and,<br>
therefore, passage of salts as a percentage of that concentration) reach their highest<br>
. levels. In this regard, the salt passage/percent rejection parameter is generally<br>
determined as an average value based on values measured during all stages of the<br>
membrane system.<br>
Further, flow meters generally employed in such systems are subject to<br>
calibration inaccuracies, thus requiring frequent calibration. Moreover, typical<br>
monitoring of reverse osmosis and other membrane separations can routinely require<br>
the additional and/or combined use of a number of different techniques, thus increasing<br>
the complexity and expense of monitoring.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists to monitor and/or control membrane separation<br>
processes winch can treat feed streams, such as aqueous feed streams, suitable for use<br>
in industrial processes where conventional monitoring techniques are generally<br>
complex and/or may lack the sensitivity and selectivity necessary to adequately monitor<br>
one or more process parameters specific to membrane separation processes which are<br>
important to the evaluation of the performance of membrane separation.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and systems for monitoring and/or<br>
controlling membrane separation processes capable of treating feed streams suitable for<br>
use in industrial processes. In this regard, the detection of inert fluorescent tracers is<br>
utilized to evaluate and/or control a number of different process parameters unique to<br>
membrane separation, such as operational parameters, chemical parameters, mechanical<br>
parameters, and combinations thereof. The inert fluorescent tracer monitoring<br>
technique of the present invention can be performed with a high degree of sensitivity<br>
and selectivity with respect to the monitoring of process parameters specific to a<br>
membrane separation. In this regard, the methods and systems of the present invention<br>
can be effectively utilized to optimize the performance of membrane separation<br>
processes. Examples of such optimized performance include longer times between<br>
membrane cleanings, longer membrane life, verification of treatment chemical in the<br>
system, ability to operate at optimal recovery, and decreased energy costs due to better<br>
control of scaling, fouling<br>
and other system parameters.<br>
To this end, in an embodiment of the present invention, a method of monitoring<br>
a membrane separation process including a membrane capable of separating a feed<br>
stream into at least a first stream and a second stream is provided. The method includes<br>
the steps of providing an inert fluorescent tracer; introducing the inert fluorescent tracer<br>
into the feed stream; providing a fluorometer to detect the fluorescent signal of the<br>
inert fluorescent tracer in at least one of the feed stream, the first stream and the second<br>
stream; and using the fluorometer to determine an amount of the inert fluorescent tracer<br>
in at least one of the feed stream, the first stream and the second stream.<br><br>
In another embodiment, a method of monitoring a membrane separation system<br>
including a membrane capable of removing solutes from a feed stream suitable for use<br>
in an industrial process is provided. The method includes the steps of adding an inert<br>
tracer to the feed stream; contacting the membrane with the feed stream; separating the<br>
feed stream into a permeate stream and a concentrate stream to remove solutes from the<br>
feed stream; providing a fluorometer to detect the fluorescent signal of the inert tracer<br>
in at least one of the feed stream, the permeate stream and the concentrate stream; and<br>
using the fluorometer to measure an amount of the inert tracer in at least one of the feed<br>
stream, the permeate stream and the concentrate stream.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a membrane separation system capable of purifying<br>
an aqueous feed stream suitable for use in an industrial process is provided. The<br>
membrane separation system includes a semi-permeable membrane capable of<br>
separating the aqueous feed stream containing an inert tracer into a permeate stream<br>
and a concentrate stream to remove one or more solutes from the aqueous feed stream;<br>
a detection device capable of fluorometrically measuring an amount of the inert tracer<br>
ranging from about 5 parts per trillion ("ppt") to about 1000 parts per million ("ppm")<br>
in at least one of the aqueous feed stream, the permeate stream and the concentrate<br>
stream wherein the detection device is capable of producing a signal indicative of the<br>
amount of inert tracer that is measured; and a controller capable of processing the<br>
signal to monitor and/or control the purification of the aqueous feed stream. Such<br>
monitoring or control may include control of chemical dosing and checking the<br>
accuracy/calibration of standard instruments (e.g. flow sensors).<br>
In still another embodiment, a method of monitoring and controlling a<br>
membrane separation process including a membrane capable of removing solutes from<br><br>
a feed stream for use in an industrial process is provided. The method includes the<br>
steps of adding an inert tracer to the feed stream; contacting the membrane with the<br>
feed stream; separating the feed stream into a first effluent stream and a second effluent<br>
stream to remove solutes from the feed stream; providing a fluorometer to detect the<br>
fluorescent signal of the inert tracer in at least one of the feed stream, the first effluent<br>
stream and the second effluent stream; using the fiuorometer to measure an amount of<br>
the inert tracer ranging from about 5 ppt to about 1000 ppm in at least one of the feed<br>
stream, the first effluent stream and the second effluent stream; and evaluating one or<br>
more process parameters specific to membrane separation based on the measurable<br>
amount of the inert tracer.<br>
It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide methods and<br>
systems that utilize inert fluorescent tracers to monitor and/or control membrane<br>
separation processes or systems.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and systems<br>
that utilize measurable amounts of inert tracers to improve the operational efficiency of<br>
membrane separation processes or systems.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and systems<br>
for monitoring parameters specific to membrane separation processes with selectivity<br>
and specificity based on measurable amounts of inert tracers added to the membrane<br>
separation system.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is to provide methods and<br>
systems for monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes for purifying<br>
aqueous feed streams suitable for use in industrial water systems.<br><br>
Still further an advantage of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
performance specific to membrane separation processes or systems that utilize cross-<br>
flow and/or dead-end flow separation to remove solutes from feed streams.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in,<br>
and will be apparent in, the detailed description of the presently preferred<br>
embodiments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides methods and systems for monitoring and/or<br>
controlling membrane separation processes that are capable of removing solutes from<br>
feed streams, such as aqueous feed streams, which are suitable for use in a number of<br>
different industrial applications. More specifically, the methods and systems of the<br>
present invention can monitor and/or control membrane separation processes based on<br>
measurable amounts of inert fluorescent tracers which have been added to the<br>
membrane separation process. In this regard, a number of different process parameters<br>
specific to membrane separation; including, for example, operational parameters,<br>
chemical parameters, mechanical parameters, like parameters and combinations<br>
thereof, can be evaluated with a high degree of selectivity, specificity and accuracy<br>
such that the performance of the membrane separation process can be effectively<br>
optimized.<br>
The methods and systems of the present invention can include a variety of<br>
different and suitable components, process steps, operating conditions and the like, for<br>
monitoring and/or controlling membrane separation processes or systems. In an<br>
embodiment, the membrane separation process of the present invention includes cross<br>
flow and dead-end flow processes. During cross flow processes, the feed stream can be<br><br>
treated in a flow direction that is substantially parallel to the membrane of the<br>
separation system. With respect to dead-end flow separation processes, the feed stream<br>
can be treated in a flow direction that is substantially perpendicular to the membrane of<br>
the separation system.<br>
In general, the membrane separation processes of the present invention are<br>
capable of treating or purifying feed streams by dividing the feed stream into separate<br>
streams. In an embodiment, the feed stream is separated into at least a first and second<br>
stream, such as a permeate stream and a concentrate stream. The feed stream can<br>
contain various solutes, such as dissolved organics, dissolved inorganics, dissolved<br>
solids, suspended solids, the like or combinations thereof. Upon separation of the feed<br>
stream into the permeate and the concentrate, in membrane filters for example, the<br>
permeate stream essentially contains a substantially lower concentration of dissolved<br>
and/or suspended solutes as compared to the aqueous feed stream. On the other hand,<br>
the concentrate stream has a higher concentration of dissolved and/or suspended solutes<br>
as compared to the aqueous stream. In this regard, the permeate represents a purified<br>
feed stream, such as a purified aqueous feed stream.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention can be utilized with respect to<br>
a number of different types of membrane separation processes including, for example,<br>
cross flow processes, dead-end flow processes, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration,<br>
microfiltration, nanofiltration, electrodialysis, electrodeionization, pervaporation,<br>
membrane extraction, membrane distillation, membrane stripping, membrane aeration<br>
and the like or combinations thereof. Reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, microfiltration<br>
and nanofiltration are the preferred membrane separation processes.<br><br>
In reverse osmosis, the feed stream is typically processed under cross flow<br>
conditions. In this regard, the feed stream flows substantially parallel to the membrane<br>
surface such that only a portion of the feed stream diffuses through the membrane as<br>
permeate. The cross flow rate is routinely high in order to provide a scouring action<br>
that lessens membrane surface fouling. This can also decrease concentration<br>
polarization effects (e.g., concentration of solutes in the reduced-turbulence boundary<br>
layer at the membrane surface, which can increase the osmotic pressure at the<br>
membrane and thus can reduce permeate flow). The concentration polarization effects<br>
can inhibit the feed stream water from passing through the membrane as permeate, thus<br>
decreasing the recovery ratio, e.g., the ratio of permeate to applied feed stream. A<br>
recycle loop(s) may be employed to maintain a high flow rate across the membrane<br>
surface.<br>
Reverse osmosis processes can employ a variety of different types of<br>
membranes. Such commercial membrane element types include, without limitation,<br>
hollow fiber membrane elements, tubular membrane elements, spiral-wound membrane<br>
elements, plate and frame membrane elements, and the like, some of which are<br>
described in more detail in "The Nalco Water Handbook," Second Edition, Frank N.<br>
Kemmer ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, N.Y., 1988, incorporated<br>
hereinto, particularly Chapter 15 entitled "Membrane Separation". It should be<br>
appreciated that a single membrane element may be used in a given membrane<br>
filtration system, but a number of membrane elements can also be used depending on<br>
the industrial application.<br>
A typical reverse osmosis system is described as an example of membrane<br>
filtration and more generally membrane separation. Reverse osmosis uses mainly spiral<br><br>
wound elements or modules, which are constructed by winding layers of semi-porous<br>
membranes with feed spacers and permeate water carriers around a central perforated<br>
permeate collection tube. Typically, the modules are sealed with tape and/or fiberglass<br>
over-wrap. The resulting construction has one channel which can receive an inlet flow.<br>
The inlet stream flows longitudinally along the membrane module and exits the other<br>
end as a concentrate stream. Within the module, water passes through the semi-porous<br>
membrane and is trapped in a permeate channel which flows to a central collection<br>
tube. From this tube it flows out of a designated channel and is collected.<br>
In practice, membrane modules are stacked together, end to end, with inter-<br>
connectors joining the permeate tubes of the first module to the permeate tube of the<br>
second module, and so on. These membrane module stacks are housed in pressure<br>
vessels. Within the pressure vessel feed water passes into the first module in the stack,<br>
which removes a portion of the water as permeate water. The concentrate stream from<br>
the first membrane becomes the feed stream of the second membrane and so on down<br>
the stack. The permeate streams from all of the membranes in the stack are collected in<br>
the joined permeate tubes. Only the feed stream entering the first module, the<br>
combined permeate stream and the final concentrate stream from the last module in the<br>
stack are commonly monitored.<br>
Within most reverse osmosis systems, pressure vessels are arranged in either<br>
"stages" or "passes." In a staged membrane system, the combined concentrate streams<br>
from a bank of pressure vessels are directed to a second bank of pressure vessels where<br>
they become the feed stream for the second stage. Commonly systems have 2 to 3<br>
stages with successively fewer pressure vessels in each stage. For example, a system<br>
may contain 4 pressure vessels in a first stage, the concentrate streams of which feed 2<br><br>
pressure vessels in a second stage, the concentrate streams of which in turn feed 1<br>
pressure vessel in the third stage. This is designated as a "4:2:1" array. In a staged<br>
membrane configuration., the combined permeate streams from all pressure vessels in<br>
all stages are collected and used without further membrane treatment. Multi-stage<br>
systems are used when large volumes of purified water are required, for example for<br>
boiler feed water. The permeate streams from the membrane system may be further<br>
purified by ion exchange or other means.<br>
In a multi-pass system, the permeate streams from each bank of pressure vessels<br>
are collected and used as the feed to the subsequent banks of pressure vessels. The<br>
concentrate streams from all pressure vessels are combined without further membrane<br>
treatment of each individual stream. Multi-pass systems are used when very high<br>
purity water is required, for example in the microelectronics or pharmaceutical<br>
industries.<br>
It should be clear from the above examples that the concentrate stream of one<br>
stage of an RO system can be the feed stream of another stage. Likewise the permeate<br>
stream of a single pass of a multi-pass system may be the feed stream of a subsequent<br>
pass. A challenge in monitoring systems such as the reverse osmosis examples cited<br>
above is that there are a limited number of places where sampling and monitoring can<br>
occur, namely the feed, permeate and concentrate streams. In some, but not all,<br>
systems "inter-stage" sampling points allow sampling/monitoring of the first stage<br>
concentrate/second stage feed stream. Similar inter-pass sample points may be<br>
available on multi-pass systems as well.<br>
In practice it is possible to "probe" the permeate collection tube within a single<br>
pressure vessel to sample the quality of the permeate from each of the membrane<br><br>
elements in the stack. It is a time consuming, messy and inexact method and is not<br>
routinely applied except in troubleshooting situations. There is no currently accepted<br>
method of examining the feed/concentrate stream quality of individual membrane<br>
elements within a single pressure vessel.<br>
In contrast to cross-flow filtration membrane separation processes, conventional<br>
filtration of suspended solids can be conducted by passing a feed fluid through a filter<br>
media or membrane in a substantially perpendicular direction. This effectively creates<br>
one exit stream during the service cycle. Periodically, the filter is backwashed by<br>
passing a clean fluid in a direction opposite to the feed, generating a backwash effluent<br>
containing species that have been retained by the filter. Thus conventional filtration<br>
produces a feed stream, a purified stream and a backwash stream. This type of<br>
membrane separation is typically referred to as dead-end flow separation and is<br>
typically limited to the separation of suspended particles greater than about one micron<br>
in size.<br>
Cross-flow filtration techniques, on the other hand, can be used for removing<br>
smaller particles (generally about one micron in size or less), colloids and dissolved<br>
solutes. Such types of cross-flow membrane separation systems can include, for<br>
example, reverse osmosis, microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, electrodialysis<br>
or the like. Reverse osmosis can remove even low molecular weight dissolved species<br>
that are at least about 0.0001 to about 0.001 microns in minimum diameter, including,<br>
for example, ionic and nonionic species, low molecular weight molecules,<br>
water-soluble macromolecules or polymers, suspended solids, colloids, and such<br>
substances as bacteria and viruses.<br><br>
In this regard, reverse osmosis is often used commercially to treat water that has<br>
a moderate to high (e.g., 500 ppm or greater) total dissolved solids ("TDS") content.<br>
Typically on order of from about 2 percent to about 5 percent of the TDS of a feed<br>
stream will pass through the membrane. Thus, in general the permeate may not be<br>
entirely free of solutes. In this regard, the TDS of reverse osmosis permeates may be<br>
too high for some industrial applications, such as use as makeup water for high pressure<br>
boilers. Therefore, reverse osmosis systems and other like membrane separation<br>
systems are frequently used prior to and in combination with an ion exchange process<br>
or other suitable process to reduce the TDS loading on the resin and to decrease the<br>
amount of hazardous material used and stored for resin regeneration, such as acids and<br>
sodium hydroxide.<br>
As discussed above, the performance of membrane separation systems can vary<br>
with respect to a number of different operational conditions specific to membrane<br>
separation, such as temperature, pH, pressure, permeate flow, activity of treatment<br>
and/or cleaning agents, fouling activity and the like. When developing and/or<br>
implementing a monitoring and/or control program based on the detection of inert<br>
fluorescent tracers, the effects of the operational conditions specific to membrane<br>
separation must necessarily be taken into consideration. As previously discussed, the<br>
operational conditions of water treatment processes can vary greatly from process to<br>
process. In this regard, the monitoring techniques as applied to each process can vary<br>
greatly.<br>
Membrane separation processes and the monitoring thereof are unique because<br>
of the following considerations.<br><br>
1.	Systems are constructed with limited flexibility in terms of where<br>
monitoring may be done and/or where samples may be collected.<br>
2.	Membrane separation systems include a concentration polarization layer<br>
that forms as water is permeated through the barrier. This is not present in other water<br>
treatment systems, such as cooling water systems.<br>
3.	Membrane separation systems operate at significantly lower<br>
temperatures than industrial processes where inverse solubility of solutes is a problem.<br>
However, in the case of membrane separation systems such as reverse osmosis and<br>
nanofiltration, this low temperature leads to scaling from salts that are less likely to be<br>
problematic in higher temperature processes (such as silica and silicate salts). In this<br>
regard, typical day-to-day membrane separation operations (for example RO and NF)<br>
occur at about 75°F.<br>
4.	Because it is essential that the surface of the membrane remain clean, a<br>
relatively small amount of fine precipitate can cause a significant performance loss.<br>
The performance loss in a membrane is, thus, more sensitive to precipitate deposition<br>
as compared to cooling water treatment. In this regard, performance loss in a<br>
membrane can occur at a film thickness appreciably lower than that required for heat<br>
transfer loss to occur in a cooling water system.<br>
5.	Water loss in membrane filtration is due to "permeation" or passage<br>
through the membrane barrier. Damaged or otherwise imperfect membranes are<br>
susceptible to undesirable leakage of solutes through the membrane. Thus it is critical<br>
to monitor leakage through the membrane to keep it operating at maximum efficiency.<br>
6.	The thin, semi-permeable films (polymeric, organic or inorganic) are<br>
sensitive to degradation by chemical species. Products which contact the membranes<br><br>
surface must be compatible with the membrane chemistry to avoid damaging the<br>
surface and thereby degrading performance.<br>
7. Chemical treatments used in membrane systems must be demonstrated<br>
to be compatible with the membrane material prior to use. Damage from incompatible<br>
chemicals can result in immediate loss of performance and perhaps degradation of the<br>
membrane surface. Such immediate, irreversible damages from a chemical treatment is<br>
highly uncommon in cooling water systems.<br>
Based on these differences, a number of different factors and considerations<br>
must necessarily be taken into account when developing and/or implementing<br>
monitoring and/or controlling programs with respect to membrane separation systems<br>
as compared to other water treatment processes, such as cooling water treatment<br>
processes.<br>
For example, both the cost of the membrane and the energy consumed can be<br>
significant operating cost factors specific to a membrane separation process. In this<br>
regard, deposits of scale and foulants on the membrane, on a small scale, can adversely<br>
impact the performance of membrane separation systems by, in membrane filtration for<br>
example, decreasing the permeate flow for a given driving force, lowering the permeate<br>
quality (purity), increasing energy consumed to maintain a given permeate flow,<br>
causing membrane replacement and/or unscheduled downtime for membrane<br>
replacement or cleaning/renovation, other like conditions and combinations thereof. In<br>
this regard, the continuous monitoring of process parameters specific to membrane<br>
filtration such as normalized permeate flow, driving force, differential pressure and<br>
percent rejection are generally believed to be critical to the detection of fouling and/or<br>
scaling and, thus, the implementation of remedial measures when such problems are<br><br>
observed. In reverse osmosis, about a ten to fifteen percent change in any of these<br>
parameters routinely signals a scaling/fouling problem requiring a responsive action,<br>
such as the adjustment of the dosage of treatment agent. Thus, detection of these<br>
problems at the earliest possible time can prevent, for example, undue energy<br>
consumption, loss of product, premature membrane replacement and the like. Ideally,<br>
when an unfavorable or questionable condition or change is detected in a system, some<br>
means, such as an alarm, will be used to notify an operator of the condition or change.<br>
Corrective action may then be taken as necessary or appropriate.<br>
Applicants have uniquely discovered that the monitoring and/or controlling of<br>
process parameters specific to membrane separation based on measuring an amount of<br>
inert fluorescent tracer is faster, more sensitive, more comprehensive, more selective<br>
and/or more reliable than conventional techniques presently available, particularly<br>
when the monitoring methods of the present invention are employed on a substantially<br>
continuous basis. The present invention has enhanced diagnostic capabilities such that,<br>
for example, lack of chemical treatment, unplanned increases in percent recovery,<br>
increased passage of solutes, flow irregularities and scaling and/or fouling problems<br>
unique to membrane separation and/or membrane filtration can be detected with<br>
reasonable certainty, with far greater sensitivity, and under a far less elapsed time than<br>
the presently available methods. In this regard, temporary system upsets or other<br>
short-lived variations can be detected during continuous monitoring as the transient<br>
conditions that they are, rather than as incorrect warning signs as detected by sporadic<br>
monitorings.<br>
As previously discussed, the methods and systems of the present invention<br>
employ inert fluorescent tracers to monitor and/or control the membrane separation<br><br>
processes. By utilizing inert tracers, the present invention can evaluate a number of<br>
different membrane separation process parameters with a greater selectivity and<br>
sensitivity as compared to conventional monitoring techniques. In this regard, the<br>
measurable amount of inert tracers can be effectively utilized to optimally maximize<br>
the performance of such systems.<br>
The term "inert," as used herein refers to an inert fluorescent tracer that is not<br>
appreciably or significantly affected by any other chemistry in the system, or by the<br>
other system parameters such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, redox potential,<br>
microbiological activity or biocide concentration. To quantify what is meant by "not<br>
appreciably or significantly affected", this statement means that an inert fluorescent<br>
compound has no more than a 10% change in its fluorescent signal, under severe<br>
conditions encountered in industrial water systems. Severe conditions normally<br>
encountered in industrial water systems are known to people of ordinary skill in the art<br>
of industrial water systems.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of different and suitable inert tracers can<br>
be utilized in any suitable amount, number and application. For example, a single tracer<br>
can be used to evaluate a number of different membrane separation process parameters.<br>
However, the present invention can include the use of a number of different tracers<br>
each functioning as tracers for separate monitoring applications. In an embodiment,<br>
inert fluorescent tracer monitoring of the present invention can be conducted on a<br>
singular, intermittent or semi-continuous basis, and preferably the concentration<br>
determination of the tracer in the stream is conducted on-site to provide a rapid real-<br>
time determination.<br><br>
An inert tracer must be transportable with the water of the membrane separation<br>
system and thus substantially, if not wholly, water-soluble therein at the concentration<br>
it is used, under the temperature and pressure conditions specific and unique to the<br>
membrane separation system. In other words, an inert tracer displays properties similar<br>
to a solute of the membrane separation process in which it is used. In an embodiment,<br>
it is preferred that the inert tracer of the present invention meet the following criteria:<br>
1.	Not be adsorbed by the membrane in any appreciable amount;<br>
2.	Not degrade the membrane or otherwise hinder its performance or alter<br>
its composition;<br><br>
3.	Be detectable on a continuous or semi-continuous basis and susceptible,<br>
to concentration measurements that are accurate, repeatable and capable of being<br>
performed on feedwater, concentrate water, permeate water or other suitable media or<br>
combinations thereof;<br>
4.	Be substantially foreign to the chemical species that are normally<br>
present in the water of the membrane separation systems in which the inert tracer(s)<br>
may be used;<br>
5.	Be substantially impervious to interference from, or biasing by, the<br>
chemical species that are normally present in the water of membrane separation<br>
systems in winch the inert tracer(s) may be used;<br>
6.	Be substantially impervious to any of its own potential specific or<br>
selective losses from the water of membrane separation systems, including selective<br>
permeation of the membrane;<br><br>
7.	Be compatible with all treatment agents employed in the water of the<br>
membrane separation systems in which the inert tracer(s) may be used, and thus in no<br>
way reduce the efficacy thereof;<br>
8.	Be compatible with all components of its formulation; and<br>
9.	Be relatively nontoxic and environmentally safe, not only within the<br>
environs of the water or the membrane separation process in which it may be used, but<br>
also upon discharge therefrom.<br>
It should be appreciated that the amount of inert tracer to be added to the<br>
membrane separation process that is effective without being grossly excessive can vary<br>
with respect to a variety of factors including, without limitation, the monitoring method<br>
selected, the extent of background interference associated with the selected monitoring<br>
method, the magnitude of the expected inert tracer(s) concentration in the feedwater<br>
and/or concentrate, the monitoring mode (such as, an on-line continuous monitoring<br>
mode), and other similar factors. In an embodiment, the dosage of an inert tracer added<br>
to the membrane separation system includes an amount that is at least sufficient to<br>
provide a measurable concentration in, for example, the concentrate stream, at steady<br>
state of at least about 5 ppt, and preferably at least about 1 ppb or about 5 ppb or<br>
higher, such as, up to about 100 ppm or about 200 ppm, or even as high as about 1000<br>
ppm in the concentrate or other effluent stream. In an embodiment, the amount of<br>
tracer ranges from about 5 ppt to about 1000 ppm, preferably from about 1 ppb to about<br>
50 ppm, more preferably from about 5 ppb to about 50 ppb.<br>
In an embodiment, the inert tracer can be added to a membrane separation<br>
system as a component of a formulation, rather than as a separate component, such as a<br>
dry solid or neat liquid. The inert tracer formulation or product may include an<br><br>
aqueous solution or other substantially homogeneous mixture that disperses with<br>
reasonable rapidity in the membrane separation system to which it is added. In this<br>
regard, the inert tracer's concentration may be correlated to the concentration of a<br>
product. In an embodiment, the product or formulation can include a treatment agent<br>
which is added to treat scaling and/or fouling.<br>
A variety of different and suitable types of compounds can be utilized as inert<br>
fluorescent tracers. In an embodiment, the inert fluorescent compounds can include,<br>

The most preferred fluorescent inert tracers of the present invention include<br>
1,3,6,8-pyrenetetiasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (CAS Registry No. 59572-10-0); 1,5-<br>
naphthalenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (hydrate) (CAS Registry No. 1655-29-4, aka<br>

fluorescein (CAS Registry No. 2321-07-5); fluorescein, sodium salt (CAS Registry No.<br><br>
518-47-8, aka Acid Yellow 73, Uranine); 2-anthracenesulfonic acid sodium salt (CAS<br>
Registry No. 16106-40-4); 1,5-anthracenedisulfonic acid (CAS Registry No. 61736-91-<br>

salts thereof; 1,8-anthracenedisulfonic acid (CAS Registry No. 61736-92-3) and salts<br>
thereof; and mixtures thereof. The fluorescent tracers listed above are commercially<br>
available from a variety of different chemical supply companies.<br>
In addition to the tracers listed above, those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
salts using alternate counter ions may also be used. Thus, for example, anionic tracers<br>
which have Na as a counter ion could also be used in forms where the counter ion is<br>
chosen from the list of: K+, Li+, NH4+, Ca+2, Mg+2 or other appropriate counter ions. In<br>
the same way, cationic tracers may have a variety of counter ions, for example: CI",<br>
SO4-2, PO4-3, HPO4-2; H2P04; C03-2;<br>
HCO3"; or other appropriate counter ions.<br>
Modifications of these tracers to control molecular weight or physical size<br>
within a desirable size range by, for example, affixing them to an inert polymeric<br>
molecule, incorporating them into a fluorescent microsphere or adding additional<br>
chemical moieties in the side chains of the molecules should be obvious to those skilled<br>
in the art. Such modifications are included herein.<br>
As previously discussed, the inert tracer(s) is measured or detected to evaluate<br>
the performance of the membrane separation process. A determination of the presence<br>
of an inert fluorescent tracer and the concentration thereof in the influent/feedwater<br>
and/or other process stream of a membrane separation process can be made when the<br>
concentration of the inert tracer in the influent/feedwater and/or other stream of a<br><br>
membrane separation system is several parts per million or less, even as low as parts<br>
per billion as previously discussed.<br>
At times, it may be desired to employ a number of inert tracers. In this regard,<br>
it may be desired to use a number of inert tracers to monitor, for example, inert<br>
tracer-specific losses, variances, like conditions or combinations thereof. Such separate<br>
and distinct inert tracers can each be detected and quantified in a single<br>
influent/feedwater and/or other stream fraction despite both being inert fluorescent<br>
tracers provided that their respective wavelengths of emission do not interfere with one<br>
another. Thus, concurrent analyses for multiple inert tracers is possible by selection of<br>
inert tracers that have appropriate spectral characteristics.<br>
The inert tracers of the present invention can be detected by utilizing a variety<br>
of different and suitable techniques. For example, fluorescence emission spectroscopy<br>
on a substantially continuous basis, at least over a given time period, is one of the<br>
preferred analytical techniques according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
One method for the continuous on-stream measuring of chemical tracers by<br>
fluorescence emission spectroscopy and other analysis methods is described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, JJ. Hickey, W.H. Hoy, J.E. Hoots and D.A.<br>
Johnson, issued February 12, 1991, incorporated hereinto by reference.<br>
In general, for most fluorescence emission spectroscopy methods having a<br>
reasonable degree of practicality, it is preferable to perform the analysis without<br>
isolating in any manner the tracer(s). Thus, there may be some degree of background<br>
fluorescence in the influent/feedwater and/or concentrate on which the fluorescence<br>
analysis is conducted. This background fluorescence may come from chemical<br>
compounds in the membrane separation system (including the influent/feedwater<br><br>
system thereof) that are unrelated to the membrane separation process of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In instances where the background fluorescence is low, the relative measurable<br>
intensities (measured against a standard fluorescent compound at a standard<br>
concentration and assigned a relative intensity, for instance 100) of the fluorescence of<br>
the inert tracer versus the background can be very high, for instance a ratio of 100/10 or<br>
500/10, when certain combinations of excitation and emission wavelengths are<br>
employed even at low fluorescent compound concentrations. Such ratios would be<br>
representative of a "relative fluorescence" (under like conditions) of respectively 10 and<br>
50. In an embodiment, the excitation/emission wavelengths and/or the amount of inert<br>
tracer employed are selected to provide a relative fluorescence of at least about 5 or<br>
about 10 for the given background fluorescence anticipated.<br>
Examples of fluorometers that may be used in the practice of this invention<br>
include the TRASAR® 3000 and TRASAR® 8000 fluorometers (available from Ondeo<br>
Nalco Company of Naperville, IL); the Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer (available from<br>
Hitachi through Hitachi Instruments Inc. of San Jose, CA); the JOBIN YvON<br>
FluoroMax-3 "SPEX" fluorometer (available from JOBIN YVON Inc. of Edison, NJ);<br>
and the Gilford Fluoro-IV spectrophotometer or the SFM 25 (available from Bio-tech<br>
Kontron through Research Instruments International of San Diego, CA). It should be<br>
appreciated that the fluorometer list is not comprehensive and is intended only to show<br>
examples of fluorometers. Other commercially available fluorometers and<br>
modifications thereof can also be used in this invention.<br>
It should be appreciated that a variety of other suitable analytical techniques<br>
may be utilized to measure the amount of inert tracers during the membrane separation<br><br>
process. Examples of such techniques include combined HPLC-fluorescence analysis,<br>
colorimetry analysis, ion selective electrode analysis, transition metal analysis and the<br>
like.<br>
For example, the combination of high-pressure liquid chromatography<br>
("HPLC") and fluorescence analyses of inert fluorescent tracers can be utilized to detect<br>
measurable amounts of the inert tracer within the membrane separation system of the<br>
present invention, particularly when very low levels of the inert tracer are used or the<br>
background fluorescence encountered would otherwise interfere with the efficacy of<br>
fluorescence analysis. The HPLC-fluorescence analysis method allows the inert tracer<br>
compound to be separated from the fluid matrix and then the inert tracer concentration<br>
can be measured.<br>
The HPLC method can also be effectively employed to separate an inert tracer<br>
compound from a fluid matrix for the purposes of then employing an inert<br>
tracer-detection method other than the fluorescence analysis. An example of this type<br>
of chromatographic technique is described in "Techniques in Liquid Chromatography",<br>

herein by reference, and "Standard Method for the Examination of Water and<br>
Wastewater", 17th Edition, American Public Health Association, pp. 6-9 to 6-10, 1989,<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
With respect to colorimetry analysis, colorimetry and/or spectrophotometry may<br>
be employed to detect and/or quantify an inert chemical tracer. Colorimetry is a<br>
determination of a chemical specie from its ability to absorb ultraviolet or visible light.<br>
Calorimetric analysis techniques and the equipment that may be employed therefor are<br><br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, JJ. Hickey, W.H. Hoy, J.E.<br>
Hoots and D.A. Johnson, issued February 12, 1991, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
With respect to ion selective electrode analysis, an ion selective electrode may<br>
be used to determine the concentration of an inert chemical tracer through the direct<br>
potentiometric measurement of specific ionic tracers in aqueous systems. An example<br>
of an ion selective electrode tracer monitoring technique is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,992,380, B.E. Moriarty, JJ. Hickey, W.H. Hoy, J.E. Hoots and D.A. Johnson, issued<br>
February 12, 1991, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
It should be appreciated that analytical techniques for detecting and/or<br>
quantifying the presence and/or concentration of a chemical specie without isolation<br>
thereof are within an evolving technology. In this regard, the above survey of<br>
analytical techniques suitable for use in detecting measurable amounts of the inert<br>
tracer during the membrane separation process of the present invention may presently<br>
not be exhaustive. Thus, analytical techniques equivalent to the above for purposes of<br>
the present invention may likely be developed in the future.<br>
As previously discussed, the present invention can provide highly selective<br>
and/or sensitive monitoring of a variety of process parameters unique and specific to<br>
the membrane separation process. The monitoring is based on the measurable amounts<br>
of an inert tracer analyzed during the membrane separation process. In this regard, the<br>
inert tracer can be detected at any suitable location or locations within the membrane<br>
separation process, such as any suitable position in a membrane filtration process along<br>
the feedwater stream, the concentrate stream, the permeate stream, the like or<br>
combinations thereof. This effectively corresponds to a concentration of the inert<br>
tracer in each stream.<br><br>
In an embodiment, the monitoring of the membrane filtration process of the<br>
present invention can be based on a measurable amount of the inert tracer from at least<br>
one of the feedwater stream, the permeate stream and the concentrate stream. For<br>
example, when the parameter of interest is the percent rejection (discussed below), it is<br>
believed that the most sensitive determinations are of the feedwater inert tracer<br>
concentration and the permeate inert tracer concentration (which will be zero if the<br>
percent rejection is 100 percent). The percent rejection parameter, that is, the percent<br>
of solute that has been rejected or has not passed through the membrane, can be<br>
determined by the following relationships:<br>
Equation 1 CR = CB/CF = F/B<br>
Equation 2 F = P[CR/(CR- 1)]<br>
Equation 3 CR = [ 1 /(l - R)]<br>
where CF is the concentration of solute in the feed stream (e.g., combined fresh feed<br>
fluid and recycled feed fluid); Cp is the concentration of solute in the permeate as<br>
discharged through; CB is the concentration of solute in the concentrate water as<br>
discharged through; F is the feed stream flow rate in gal/min; P is the permeate<br>
discharge flow rate in gal/min; B is the concentrate water flow rate; L is the recycle<br>
rate; R is the recovery ratio (e.g., P/F); and CR is the concentration ratio, (e.g., CB/CF).<br>
When there is less than complete rejection of a solute, for instance only SO<br>
percent rejection (e.g., a 0.8 rejection factor), CR will be less than F/B as shown in<br>
Equation 4:<br>
Equation 4 CR = (F/B) x rejection factor<br><br>
The rejection factor again is the measure of the extent of solute rejection by the<br>
membrane, as calculated in Equation 5, wherein CF is the concentration of solute in the<br>
feedwater and Cp is the concentration of solute in the permeate:<br>
Equation 5 rejection factor = (CF - Cp) / CF<br>
The same equations will apply in a traced stream (e.g., a stream that contains an<br>
inert tracer(s)) wherein "tracer-C" (e.g., tracer-CF, tracer-Cp and tracer-CB) is<br>
substituted for CF, CP and CB in equations 1-5. When there is less than complete<br>
rejection of an inert tracer, for instance only 80 percent rejection (a 0.8 rejection<br>
factor), tracer-CR will be less than F/B as shown in Equation 4. In this regard, the<br>
determination of the rejection of the inert tracer in the membrane filtration system is at<br>
least proportional to the rejection of the solute within same. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the percent rejection is determined and maintained at an amount ranging<br>
from about 95 to about 100 percent.<br>
In this regard, monitoring of an amount of the inert tracer as it may vary during<br>
membrane filtration can be utilized to evaluate a number of process parameters specific<br>
to membrane filtration such as a percent recovery, percent rejection, recovery ratio or<br>
the like, with a high degree of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy, as previously<br>
discussed. The ability to evaluate these types of membrane separation process<br>
parameters with such level of certainty, sensitivity and selectivity and on a continual<br>
basis in accordance with the present invention can provide a better understanding, in<br>
real time, of the performance of the membrane. Thus, adjustments to the membrane<br>
separation process can be made more responsively and effectively based on the<br>
measured amount of the inert tracer, if needed, to optimize membrane performance.<br>
For example, adjustments can be made to increase the recovery ratio or percent<br><br>
recovery of the membrane separation system. In this regard, increasing the recovery<br>
ratio or percent recovery, for unit product, will reduce the feedwater required and thus<br>
reduce feedwater costs, lower influent fluid pretreatment costs and chemical treatment<br>
requirements. It should be appreciated that the optimal percent rejection value can vary<br>
with respect to the type of membrane separation system. In addition, percent recovery<br>
may be calculated in various ways. In membrane filtration the percent recovery<br>
calculation can be based on ratios of the various streams or on concentrations of solutes<br>
within those streams. In this regard, the amount of inert tracer in the various streams<br>
can provide an accurate assessment of percent recovery as well as a method for<br>
checking the calibration of the mechanical flow sensors in the system.<br>
However, unless controlled or optimally minimized, scaling and/or fouling of<br>
the membrane can adversely impact the performance of membrane separation. If<br>
deposition on the membrane is neither prevented nor detected soon enough for effective<br>
removal by cleaning methods, the normal life of the membrane, which can be about<br>
three to five years for reverse osmosis, may be severely shortened and replacement<br>
costs dramatically increased. As previously discussed, the membrane separation<br>
systems are more sensitive to such scaling and/or fouling activity as compared to<br>
cooling water systems. It should be appreciated that the membrane separation system of<br>
the present invention can include any suitable type and amount of components in order<br>
to effectively treat the scale and/or fouling conditions, such as, any suitable treatment<br>
or pretreatment system including antiscalants and/or biofouling agents, filters,<br>
treatment equipment, such as chemical agent delivery devices, suitable like components<br>
or combinations thereof.<br><br>
For example, suitable antiscalants that can be used in the membrane separation<br>
system (especially reverse osmosis systems) of the present invention include suitable<br>
polymers in aqueous solution which inhibit the formation and growth of alkaline earth<br>
carbonate and sulfate scales, including calcium carbonate ("CaCO3"), calcium sulfate<br>
("CaSO4') or the like. Antiscalant chemicals are generally fed continuously into the<br>
feed stream wherein the optimum feed point is before a cartridge prefilter positioned<br>
along the feedwater stream. The use of a continuous feed of antiscalants can minimize<br>
or eliminate the need for acid to be fed into the system in order to control scale, and can<br>
facilitate the suspension of solids and colloids in solution. This can minimize<br>
membrane fouling, and inhibit the precipitation ofCaCO3 and CaSO4<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention can monitor and/or control the<br>
concentration of the scaling and/or fouling treatment agents within the membrane<br>
separation process based on the measurable amounts of the inert fluorescent tracer in<br>
the system. In an embodiment, the inert tracer is continuously fed to the feedwater<br>
along with the treatment agents. It should be appreciated that the inert tracer can be<br>
added separately or as a part of a formulation of the treatment agent to the feedwater.<br>
In an embodiment, the inert tracer is fed to the feedwater in known proportion to the<br>
scaling and/or biofouling agent. In this regard, the measure of the inert tracer<br>
concentration corresponds to (is proportional to) the chemical concentration (under<br>
zero-systcm-consumption conditions) at any suitable tracer monitoring point within the<br>
membrane separation system.<br>
The chemicals or treatment agents employed as antiscalants and/or anti-fouling<br>
agents, and the mechanisms by which they inhibit scale deposition, may change as<br>
improvements are made in antiscalant chemistry for membrane filtration systems, but<br><br>
the need for a continuous feed of treatment agents will most likely continue despite the<br>
improvements.<br>
As previously discussed, inert tracers of the present invention can be utilized to<br>
monitor a variety of different parameters specific to membrane separation such that the<br>
performance of membrane separation processes can be effectively monitored and<br>
controlled. In an embodiment, the parameters can include normalized permeate flow<br>
and percent rejection (as discussed above). In this regard, the present invention can be<br>
utilized to assess and/or control a variety of different process conditions that can impact<br>
membrane performance, for example, scaling and/or fouling conditions, membrane<br>
leakage, degradation and the like specific to the membrane separation process as<br>
previously discussed.<br>
It should be appreciated that the preferred inert tracers of the present invention,<br>
substantially have a rejection factor of 1, and more preferably are employed in minute<br>
concentrations. Thus, the use of the inert tracer of the present invention does not in any<br>
significant manner add to the total dissolved solids ("TDS") of the permeate nor<br>
detrimentally effect a downstream ion exchange process or other permeate polishing<br>
process.<br>
Normalized Permeate Flow Monitoring<br>
The normalized permeate flow is typically considered a sensitive forecaster of<br>
trouble in a membrane filtration process, such as reverse osmosis. In this regard, a<br>
reduction of the permeate flow rate is a strong indicator of membrane fouling, whereas<br>
its increase is a strong indicator of membrane degradation, for instance due to an<br>
adverse operation condition. In reverse osmosis the actual permeate flow rate can vary<br>
with respect to the feed stream temperature, driving force and feedstream TDS.<br><br>
Normalized permeate flow is determined through a simple calculation which eliminates<br>
the effect of actual system temperature and driving force variations and converts the<br>
actual permeate flow readings to what they would be if the system were operating at<br>
constant ("normal") driving force and temperature conditions, which are routinely the<br>
start-up driving force and 25° C. The actual permeate flow rate is conventionally a<br>
direct reading from a permeate flowmeter. The temperature conversion factor for a<br>
given feedwater temperature is provided by the membrane manufacturer for each<br>
specific membrane.<br>
Normalized Permeate Flow Example<br>
In reverse osmosis systems employing differential pressure as the driving force,<br>
the feed pressure and permeate pressure variations are reduced to a differential pressure<br>
conversion factor which includes the start-up net pressure divided by the actual net<br>
differential pressure (e.g., a differential pressure calculated by subtracting the permeate<br>
pressure from the feed pressure, which in turn can be measured from any suitable<br>
pressure meters). The permeate flow rate is multiplied by the temperature conversion<br>
factor and the driving pressure conversion factor. Applicants have discovered that the<br>
monitoring of the inert tracer of the present invention can be used to enhance<br>
normalized flow monitoring.<br>
The monitoring of inert tracer concentrations in the feedwater and the<br>
concentrate can provide a measure of actual permeate flow, which will be the<br>
difference between total flow (e.g., the feedwater flow which an inert tracer measures)<br>
and concentrate flow (which an inert tracer also measures). The inert tracer<br>
monitorings of the present invention, thus, can provide a measure of actual permeate<br>
flow in addition to the readings from the usual flow meter. With a combination of<br><br>
normalized permeate flow determinations and driving force measures, several critical<br>
trends can be readily detected. If the normalized permeate flow is dropping while the<br>
driving force is increasing, this signals membrane fouling. If, instead, the normalized<br>
permeate flow is dropping while the driving force remains the same there is a<br>
forewarning to check the gauges and the like for accuracy.<br>
As previously discussed, there exists a relationship between the flow rate and<br>
the concentration of the inert tracer such that the water flow can be determined based<br>
on the measurable amount of the inert tracer in the membrane separation system. The<br>
flow rate of any membrane separation process stream is the volume that passes a given<br>
point within a given time period. The monitoring of the concentration of an inert tracer<br>
in a stream at a given point, thus, can provide a determination of flow rate by mass<br>
balance of inert tracer ions in solution compared to inert tracer added. Alternatively,<br>
since the mass flow rates of the discharge streams, in combination, must equal the mass<br>
flow rate of the feed stream, and the mass of the inert tracer in the discharge streams, in<br>
combination, must equal the mass of the inert tracer in the feedstream, flow rates and/or<br>
inert tracer concentrations of one of such streams can be calculated from the others,<br>
when known. Moreover, when an inert tracer is added to the feedwater at a known rate<br>
(e.g., amount per unit time), the concentration of an inert tracer in the feedwater as it<br>
passes the feedwater tracer monitoring point itself can determine the flow rate of the<br>
feed stream.<br>
Differential Pressure Monitoring<br>
In membrane filtration, the differential pressure is the difference between the<br>
feed pressure and the concentrate pressure. It is a measure of the hydraulic pressure<br>
losses through the membrane-filtration membrane elements and the manifold piping.<br><br>
When the feed stream flow channels become clogged, the driving force increases. The<br>
differential pressure also depends upon the feedstream flow rate and the percent<br>
recovery. An accurate comparison between differential pressure readings taken at<br>
different times requires that the membrane filtration system is operating at the same<br>
percent recovery and feed flow rate in each instance. In this regard, inert tracer<br>
monitoring can be utilized to accurately assess the differential pressure of the<br>
membrane separation system. It should be appreciated that the differential pressure at<br>
any given point in time can be determined by conventional methods.<br>
Percent Rejection Monitoring<br>
The percent rejection is the percentage of solute(s) that is rejected by the<br>
membrane separation process. In practice, a percent rejection is based on one or more<br>
selected solutes rather than the entirety of solutes in the feedwater, and the percent<br>
rejection value can include an accompanying identification of the reference solute(s).<br>
The percent rejection often will change upon the onset of a membrane and/or system<br>
problem, such as fouling, scaling, membrane hydrolysis, improper pH, too low of a<br>
feed pressure, too high of a recovery rate, a change in the composition of the influent<br>
fluid source, a leaking "O" ring and the like. Typically, a decrease in percent rejection<br>
can indicate problems associated with membrane performance. However, the percent<br>
rejection may increase upon membrane clogging by certain foulants. In membrane<br>
filtration the percent rejection is the rejection factor (e.g., Equation 5) expressed as a<br>
percentage (e.g., multiplied by 100). The present process permits the percent rejection<br>
to be determined almost instantaneously, using Equation 6 as follows:<br>
Equation 6 rejection factor = (tracer-Op - tracer-Cp)/tracer-CF<br><br>
where the virtually instantaneous and continuous monitorings of the feedwater inert<br>
tracer concentration and the permeate inert tracer concentration can be determined with<br>
a high degree of selectivity, sensitivity and accuracy as previously discussed. Since the<br>
feedwater inert tracer concentration (tracer-CF) effectively varies little in contrast to<br>
other feedwater solutes (whose concentrations vary with feedwater quality<br>
fluctuations), and since the inert tracer can be detected more accurately at low levels<br>
than most all other solutes, less natural data variation (e.g., variations arising from<br>
feedwater concentration variations) can exist with the method of the present invention<br>
as compared to conventional percent recovery monitoring techniques that typically<br>
measure the concentration of solutes to determine percent recovery. This reduction in .<br>
natural data variation makes subtle trends easier to identify.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention can be utilized to assess<br>
and/or control a variety of different conditions that may have an impact on the<br>
performance of the membrane separation process. For example, the present invention<br>
can be utilized to monitor leaks in the membrane elements. This is very important to<br>
the practical operation of a membrane separation system.<br>
In this regard, leakage of concentrate through a membrane itself or a component<br>
of the membrane element contaminates the permeate. Permeate contamination by<br>
virtue of leakage may at times be so severe that the performance of the membrane<br>
separation process is substantially impaired, and at best the quality of the permeate is<br>
diminished. Upon such leakage there will be an increase in the normalized permeate<br>
flow and permeate solute concentrations, but the increases may be minor and most<br>
probably not be detected for at least a number of hours if conventional monitoring<br>
techniques are utilized.<br><br>
Applicants have discovered that the present invention can monitor membrane<br>
leakage with a high degree of sensitivity, selectivity and/or accuracy and that can be<br>
readily conducted on a continuous basis. For instance, if under normal conditions a<br>
reverse osmosis system is producing a 75/25 ratio of parts by weight of permeate to<br>
parts by weight of concentrate (e.g., the permeate having 40 ppm TDS and the<br>
concentrate having 2000 ppm TDS) a leakage of 1 percent of the concentrate (e.g., 0.75<br>
parts) into the permeate would increase the weight of the permeate by only 3 percent.<br>
Such increase would be difficult to detect solely by conventional methods of<br>
monitoring the normalized permeate flow. If undetected, such a leak would then<br>
double the permeate TDS to about 97 ppm. When the inert fluorescent .tracer<br>
monitoring of the present invention is utilized to monitor the permeate, particularly on a<br>
continuous or substantially continuous basis, an increase in permeate inert tracer<br>
concentration can be readily detected to signal that leakage is likely to be occurring. In<br>
addition, the detection of an increase in the concentration of permeate inert tracer<br>
would follow the onset of the leakage almost instantaneously.<br>
When a reverse osmosis system employs a number of membrane elements, the<br>
produced penneate from each are often combined before permeate quality screening.<br>
An increase in permeate TDS from, a single membrane element is less detectable by a<br>
determination of TDS with respect to the combined permeates because of the dilution<br>
effects. In addition, the TDS increase in the combined permeates does not indicate the<br>
site of the leakage. When the present process is employed to monitor permeate inert<br>
tracer concentration, the separate permeates produced by each membrane element can<br>
easily be monitored before the permeates are combined. Not only can the present<br><br>
process detect the leakage, but it can also be utilized to determine the location of the<br>
leak.<br>
In addition to the monitoring capabilities of the present invention discussed<br>
above, a number of different other process conditions of membrane separation systems<br>
can also be monitored by the present invention on a regular or continuous basis to<br>
provide a real-time assessment of membrane performance. These conditions can<br>
include, for example, concentrate flow rate, percent recovery and biocide concentration.<br>
In this regard, the SDI measures the quantity of particulate contamination in waters by<br>
particles about 0.45 micron in diameter or greater. In an embodiment, the concentrate<br>
flow rate and percent recovery can be monitored with a single inert tracer as discussed<br>
above. In an embodiment, the biocide concentration can be most effectively monitored<br>
using a separate inert tracer.<br>
The methods of the present invention can include any suitable type, number and<br>
combination of components, such as inert tracer compounds, inert tracer detection<br>
devices (e.g., analytical techniques) or the like. In an embodiment, the chemical<br>
compound(s) selected as the inert tracer(s) is soluble in the membrane separation<br>
stream to which it is added to the concentration value desired and is substantially stable<br>
in the environment thereof for the useful life expected of the inert tracer(s). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the combination of the chemical compound(s) selected as the<br>
inert tracer(s) and the analytical technique selected for determining the presence of such<br>
inert tracer(s), permits such determination without isolation of the inert tracer(s), and<br>
more preferably should permit such determination on a continuous and/or on-line basis.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention includes a controller (not shown) to<br>
monitor and/or control the operating conditions and the performance of the membrane<br><br>
separation process based on the measurable amount of inert fluorescent tracer(s). The<br>
controller can be configured and/or adjusted in a variety of different and suitable ways.<br>
For example, the controller can be in contact with the detection device (not<br>
shown) to process the detection signal (e.g., filter noise from the signal) in order to<br>
enhance the detection of the inert tracer. Further, the controller can be adjusted to<br>
communicate with other components of the membrane separation system. The<br>
communication can be either hard wired (e.g., electrical communication cable), a<br>
wireless communication (e.g., wireless RF interface), a pneumatic interface or the like.<br>
In this regard, the controller can be utilized to control the performance of<br>
membrane separation. For example, the controller can communicate with a feed device<br>
(not shown) in order to control the dosage of treatment agents, such as antiscalants and<br>
biocides, within the membrane separation process. In an embodiment, the controller is<br>
capable of adjusting the feed rate of the feed stream based on the amount of inert tracer<br>
that is measured.<br>
It should be appreciated that pairs or groups of inert tracer monitoring points<br>
that are to be compared should not be positioned across a flow-through site that has a<br>
high concentration of solids, for instance a solids concentration of at least about 5 or<br>
about 10 weight percent per unit volume based on a measured volume unit of about one<br>
cubic inch. Such high solids concentration flow-through sites are found at the site of<br>
filter cakes and the like. In this regard, these sites may absorb, or selectively absorb, at<br>
least some amount of the inert tracer. This can distort the significance of monitoring<br>
comparison. When an inert tracer is added upstream of, for instance, a cartridge filter,<br>
in an embodiment, the first monitoring location of a monitoring pair should preferably<br>
be downstream of such sites.<br><br>
However, separate monitorings across a flow-through site of high solids<br>
concentration may be conducted to determine the loss of an inert tracer from the fluid,<br>
and if such loss is nonselective for the inert tracer, the loss of other solutes at that site.<br>
For instance, when the flow-through site is a cartridge filter, such monitorings can<br>
determine the loss of solutes, if any, attributable to that pretreatment location. Other<br>
high solids concentration sites include without limitation sites of solids concentration(s)<br>
created by the use of chemical additives such as coagulants, flocculants and the like.<br>
In an embodiment, the inert tracer selected is not a visible dye, that is, the inert<br>
tracer is a chemical specie that does not have a strong absorption of electromagnetic<br>
radiation in the visible region, which extends from about 4000 Angstroms to about<br>
7000 Angstroms (from about 400 nanometers ("ran") to about 700 nm). Preferably the<br>
tracer is chosen from a class of materials which are excited by absorption of light and<br>
product fluorescent light emission, where the excitation and emission light occurs at<br>
any point within the far ultraviolet to near infrared spectral regions (wavelengths from<br>
200 - 800 nm). The relative fluorescence intensity of the inert tracer must be such that<br>
it is detectable in the amounts specified by product formulations (typically 2-10 ppb as<br>
active fluorophore when dosed into the feed water stream of a device).<br>
Alternatively, when the tracer dye does have strong adsorbtions in the visible<br>
spectrum, it is used in concentrations such that it is not detectable to the naked eye.<br>
Such embodiments may be preferred, for instance, when a membrane's percent<br>
rejection of the tracer is less than 100 percent, and it is desirable to produce a permeate<br>
free of color.<br><br>
In some instances, it may be preferable to chose a fluorophore which emits<br>
visible fluorescent light when excited by UV light. This may be preferred when visual<br>
detection and/or photographic or other imaging of the system is desired.<br>
Although membrane separation systems are often employed for the purification<br>
of water, or the processing of aqueous streams, the systems of the present invention are<br>
not limited to the use of an aqueous influent. In an embodiment, the influent may be<br>
another fluid, or a combination of water and another fluid. The operational principles<br>
of membrane separation systems and processes of the present invention are not so<br>
governed by the nature of the influent that the present invention could not be employed<br>
with influents otherwise suitable for water purification in a given membrane separation<br>
system. The descriptions of the invention above that refer to aqueous systems are<br>
applicable also to nonaqueous and mixed aqueous/nonaqueous systems.<br>
In an embodiment, the inert fluorescent tracer monitoring methods of the<br>
present invention can be utilized to monitor membranes which are subjected to<br>
destructive (sacrificial) testing. This type of testing may include the sectioning or<br>
division of an industrial membrane, for instance by cutting, into a number of separate<br>
membrane pieces prior to testing so that a number of tests can be performed, each on a<br>
different section of the membrane. In this regard, the inert fluorescent tracer<br>
monitoring of the present invention can be utilized to monitor a number of different<br>
parameters of destructive testing including, without limitation, the effects of excessive<br>
pressure, contact with a membrane-destructive fluid and the like. The diagnostic<br>
regime of the destructive testing would generally be focused on the membrane which<br>
may be subjected to visual inspection of its surface, a membrane-surface<br>
microbiological analysis by swabbing of its surface and analysis of water samples in<br><br>
contact with membrane, surface analysis for inorganic deposits by SEM/EDS, surface<br>
analysis for organic deposits by IR, electron microscopy, ICP and like surface analysis<br>
techniques.<br>
Although the membrane during destructive testing is not on-line, in an<br>
embodiment of the present invention the inert tracer can be added to a fluid stream<br>
which flows to the membrane and passes by or through it as a first effluent stream to<br>
exit as a second effluent stream. The inert tracer can be added to the fluid upstream of<br>
the membrane and the inert tracer in the fluid stream at least passes by the membrane as<br>
a component of the first effluent stream and/or passes through the membrane to exit as<br>
a component of the second effluent stream. The inert tracer is monitored in the fluid<br>
stream at a point before the membrane to determine an influent inert concentration<br>
value, and/or in at least one of the first and the second effluent streams to determine an<br>
effluent inert tracer concentration. In this regard, the inert tracer is representative of a<br>
solute of the fluid stream that can be added to the fluid in an amount sufficient for the<br>
determinations of influent inert tracer concentration and effluent inert concentration.<br>
Thus, the separation performance of the membrane can be determined prior to actual<br>
use.<br>
"Deposits" is meant herein to refer to material that forms and/or collects on<br>
surfaces of a membrane. The "amount" or "concentration" of inert tracer is meant<br>
herein to refer to the concentration of the inert tracer in the specified fluid in terms of<br>
weight of the inert tracer per unit volume of the fluid, or weight of the inert tracer per<br><br>
unit weight of the fluid, or some characteristic of the inert tracer that is proportional to<br>
its concentration in the fluid and can be correlated to a numerical value of the inert<br>
tracer concentration in the fluid (whether or not that correlation conversion is<br><br>
calculated), and can be a value of zero or substantially zero. Thus, the process of the<br>
present invention includes the detection of the absence of such chemical species, at<br>
least to the limitations of the analytical method employed.<br>
The foregoing descriptions of the present invention at times refer specifically to<br>
aqueous influents and effluents, and the use of an aqueous system for describing a<br>
membrane filtration system and the operation of the present invention therein is<br>
exemplitive. A person of ordinary skill in the art, given the disclosures of the present<br>
specification, would be aware of how to apply the foregoing descriptions to<br>
nonaqueous membrane filtration systems.<br>
"Treatment chemicals and/or agents" is 'meant herein without limitation to<br>
include treatment chemicals that enhance membrane separation process performance,<br>
antiscalants that retard/prevent membrane scale deposition, antifoulants that<br>
retard/prevent membrane fouling, biodispersants, microbial-growth inhibiting agents,<br>
such as biocides and cleaning chemicals that remove membrane deposits.<br>
It should be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to all industries<br>
that can employ membrane separation processes. For example, the different types of<br>
industrial processes in which the method of the present invention can be applied<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are intended to be illustrative of the present invention<br>
and to teach one of ordinary skill how to make and use the invention. These examples<br>
are not intended to limit the invention or its protection in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
Tests were performed using a multi-stage reverse osmosis system. The system<br>
utilized six pressure vessels, arranged in a 2:2:1:1 configuration with each pressure<br>
vessel containing 3 spiral wound membrane elements. The membrane elements were a<br>
polyamide based elements from several element manufacturers. Typical system<br>
recovery, based on system flows, was 75 - 80%, with the feed flow ranging from about<br>
100 to about 130 gpm.<br><br>
The feed water included an inert fluorescent tracer (an aqueous solution of<br>
1,3,6,8- pyrenetetrasulfonic acid tetrasodium salt (PTSA)), diluted with water to give a<br>
final concentration of 0.20 to 0.25% as the active fluorophore in an aqueous solution.<br>
The inert tracer was fed into the RO membrane system using a positive displacement<br>
pump at a feed rate of approximately 2 milliliters/minute and at a concentration of<br>
about 6 ppm into the feed stream described above.<br>
The concentration of the inert tracer was fluorometrically measured (with a<br>
TRASAR® 3000 and/or a TRASAR® 8000 fluorometer) in the RO membrane system in<br>
both the feed stream and the concentrate stream over a select period of time, generally<br>
one to three hours with data being collected at one second intervals. (Fluorometer<br>
readings were expressed as "ppm of treatment product." The fluorometer was<br>
programmed to read the concentration of the tracer and convert the reading into ppm of<br>
treatment. In this case, the treatment was assumed to contain 0.2% active fluorophore.)<br>
Periodic fluctuations in the concentration of the inert tracer in both of the concentrate<br>
and feed streams were continuously detected. For example, the concentration of the<br>
inert tracer in the concentrate stream varied from about 40 ppb of tracer (20 ppm as<br>
treatment product) to as high as about 180 ppb of tracer (90 ppm as treatment product).<br>
In general, the concentration of the inert tracer in the concentrate stream varied between<br>
about 40 ppb of tracer (20 ppm as treatment product) and about 80 ppb of tracer (40<br>
ppm as treatment product). In comparison, the concentration of the inert tracer in the<br>
feed stream varied from about 10 ppb of tracer (5 ppm as treatment product) or less to<br>
as high as about 130 ppb of tracer (65 ppm as treatment product). In general, the<br>
concentration of the inert tracer in the feed stream varied from about 10 ppb of tracer (5<br><br>
ppm as treatment product) or lower to about 20 ppb of tracer (10 ppm as treatment<br>
product).<br>
The ability of the present invention to detect fluctuations in the concentration of<br>
the inert tracer added to the membrane separation system uniquely allows the present<br>
invention to evaluate process parameters specific to a membrane separation with a high<br>
degree of selectivity, sensitivity and/or accuracy such that the performance (e.g.,<br>
operational, chemical, mechanical and/or the like) of membrane separation can be<br>
effectively monitored. In this regard, suitable adjustments can be controllably and<br>
responsively made to the membrane separation system such that performance is<br>
optimized. For example, 'the detection of fluctuations in the concentration of the inert<br>
fluorescent tracer during membrane separation (as discussed above) may necessarily<br>
indicate that suitable and responsive adjustments to the membrane separation process<br>
are necessary to decrease the fluctuations, and, thus enhance membrane separation<br>
performance.<br>
The test results also displayed spikes in the concentration of the inert tracer in<br>
both of the feed stream and the concentrate stream. As previously discussed, the spike<br>
in the amount of inert tracer in the feed stream occurred at about 120 ppb of tracer (60<br>
ppm as treatment product) in comparison to that in the concentrate stream which<br>
occurred at about 180 ppb of tracer (90 ppm as treatment product). By measuring the<br>
elapsed time between the spikes in both of the feed and concentrate streams, the<br>
effective residence time of solutes within the membrane separation system can be<br>
calculated. This information can be useful, for example, in developing a treatment<br>
strategy specific to membrane separation.<br><br>
Furthermore, the tracer was used to calculate percent recovery as described<br>
above. Whereas the percent recovery calculations based on flow measurements<br>
indicate recoveries of about 35% to about 80%, recovery calculations based on mass<br>
balance of the tracer shows significantly higher percent recovery values (89 - 92%).<br>
Such information is useful in developing effective scale control strategies.<br>
Example 2<br>
Experiments were performed using thin film composites of a polyamide based<br>
reverse osmosis membrane material in order to simulate process conditions utilizing a<br>
reverse osmosis membrane separation system.<br>
In this regard, a number of flat or planar sheets of the membrane were cut from<br>
a roll of the polyamide material which is a commercially available product, for example<br>
FT30 from FILMTEC of Minneapolis, MN.<br>
Tests were performed in a SEPA CF, flat plate reverse osmosis cell which is<br>
commercially available from the Osmonics Corporation of Minnetonka, MN. In<br>
general, the test system included a feed water tank, a high pressure pump, and the flat<br>
 plate cell. The system was modified so that the change in pressure across the<br>
membrane and the inlet pressure, as well as the feedwater, permeate water, and<br>
concentrate water conductivities, and the permeate and concentrate water flows could<br>
be continuously monitored. A data logger, available from the Yokogawa Corporation<br>
of America of Newnan, GA, was used to continuously monitor and collect data.<br>
Fluorometers (TRASAR® 3000, TRASAR® 8000 and Hitachi F-4500) were used to<br>
measure the concentrations of tracers in the systems.<br><br><br>
Permeate was sent to drain and concentrate returned to the feed water tank.<br>
The test was designed to form scale on the membrane over time, thus decreasing permeate flow.<br>
Tests were run to show monitoring of the reverse osmosis system with an<br>
undamaged membrane. As shown by the calculated performance parameters in Table 2<br>
below, the percent rejection of the tracer was 100%. This indicates that the tracer<br>
molecule did not pass through an undamaged membrane. In contrast, a portion of the<br>
dissolved salts (as measured by conductivity) did pass through the membrane.<br><br><br><br>
Another sheet of polyamide membrane material was damaged by swabbing the<br>
surface with a 0.05% hypochlorite solution. Using a feed solution of 1500 ppm NaCl,<br>
rejection of the tracer molecule was monitored. All other experimental conditions were<br>
the same as above. The results shown below in Table 4 indicate significant passage of<br>
the tracer through the damaged membrane. Since conductive salts pass through both<br>
undamaged (Table 2) and damaged (Table 3) membranes, the tracer only passes<br>
through damaged membranes, making tracer measurement a more sensitive indicator of<br>
membrane damage than conductivity measurements<br><br><br><br><br>

illustrative embodiments, these embodiments are not intended to be exhaustive or<br>
limiting of the invention. Rather, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives,<br>
