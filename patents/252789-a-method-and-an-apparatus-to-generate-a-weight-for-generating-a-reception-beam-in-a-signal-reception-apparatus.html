BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for<br>
receiving data in a mobile communication system using an Adaptive Antenna Array<br>
(AAA) technique, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for receiving data using<br>
a 2-step weight generation technique.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
A next generation mobile communication system has evolved into a packet<br>
service communication system that transmits burst packet data to a plurality of mobile<br>
stations (MSs). The packet service communication system has been designed to be<br>
suitable for the transmission of mass data. Such a packet service communication system<br>
has been developing for high-speed packet service. In this regard, the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3 GPP), a standardization organization for asynchronous<br>
communication technique, proposes a High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)<br>
to provide the high-speed packet service, while the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2<br>
(3GPP2), a standardization organization for synchronous communication technique,<br>
proposes a lx Evolution Data Only/Voice (1x EV-DO/V) to provide the high-speed<br>
packet service. Both HSDPA and lx EV-DO/V propose to provide high-speed packet<br>
service for smooth transmission of Web/Internet service, and in order to provide the<br>
high-speed packet service, a peak throughput as an well as average throughput should be<br>
optimized for smooth transmission of the packet data as well as the circuit data such as<br>
voice service data.<br>
In order to support the high-speed transmission of packet data, a<br>
communication system employing the HSDPA (hereinafter referred to as an "HSDPA<br>
communication system") has newly introduced 3 kinds of data transmission techniques:<br>
an Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) technique, a Hybrid Automatic<br>
Retransmission Request (HARQ) technique, and a Fast Cell Selection (FCS) technique.<br>
The HSDPA communication system increases a data rate using the AMC, HARQ and<br><br>
FCS techniques. As another communication system for increasing a data rate, there is a<br>
communication system using the 1x EV-DO/V (hereinafter referred to as a "1x EV-<br>
DO/V communication system"). The 1x EV-DO/V communication system also increases<br>
a data rate to secure system performance. Aside from the new techniques such as AMC,<br>
HARQ and FCS, there is a Multiple Antenna technique as another technique for coping<br>
with the limitation in assigned bandwidth, i.e. increasing a data rate. The Multiple<br>
Antenna technique can overcome the limitation of bandwidth resource in a frequency<br>
domain because it utilizes a space domain.<br>
The Multiple Antenna technique will be described herein below. A<br>
communication system is constructed such that a plurality of MSs communicate with<br>
each other via one base station (BS). When the BS performs a high-speed data<br>
transmission to the MSs, a fading phenomenon occurs due to a characteristic of radio<br>
channels. In order to overcome the fading phenomenon, a Transmit Antenna Diversity<br>
technique, a kind of the Multiple Antenna technique, has been proposed. The Transmit<br>
Antenna Diversity refers to a technique for transmitting signals using at least two<br>
transmission antennas, i.e. multiple antennas, to minimize a loss of transmission data due<br>
to a fading phenomenon, thereby increasing a data rate. The Transmit Antenna Diversity<br>
will be described herein below.<br>
Generally, in a wireless channel environment in a mobile communication<br>
system, unlike in a wired channel environment, a transmission signal is actually distorted<br>
due to several factors such as multipath interference, shadowing, wave attenuation, time-<br>
varying noise, interference, etc. Fading caused by the multipath interference is closely<br>
related to the mobility of a reflector or a user (or aMS), and actually, a mixture of a<br>
transmission signal and an interference signal is received. Therefore, the received signal<br>
suffers from severe distortion during its actual transmission, reducing performance of the<br>
entire mobile communication system. The fading may result in the distortion in the<br>
amplitude and the phase of the received signal, preventing high-speed data<br>
communication in the wireless channel environment. Many studies are being conducted<br>
in order to resolve the fading. In conclusion, in order to transmit data at a high speed, the<br>
mobile communication system must minimize a loss due to a characteristic of a mobile<br>
communication channel such as fading, and interference of an individual user. As a<br>
technique for preventing unstable communication due to the fading, a diversity<br>
technique is used, and multiple antennas are used to implement a Space Diversity<br><br>
technique, one type of the diversity technique.<br>
The Transmit Antenna Diversity is popularly used as a technique for efficiently<br>
resolving the fading phenomenon. The Transmit Antenna Diversity receives a plurality<br>
of transmission signals that have experienced an independent fading phenomena in a<br>
wireless channel environment, thereby coping with distortion caused by the fading. The<br>
Transmit Antenna Diversity is classified into Time Diversity, Frequency Diversity,<br>
Multipath Diversity, and Space Diversity. In other words, a mobile communication<br>
system must cope well with the fading phenomenon that severely affects communication<br>
performance, in order to perform the high-speed data communication. The fading<br>
phenomenon must be overcome because it reduces the amplitude of a received signal up<br>
to several dB to tens of dB. In order to overcome the fading phenomenon, the above<br>
diversity techniques are used. For example, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)<br>
technique adopts a Rake receiver that can achieve diversity performance using a delay<br>
spread of the channel. The Rake receiver is a kind of a Receive Diversity technique for<br>
receiving multipath signals. However, the Receive Diversity used in the Rake receiver is<br>
disadvantageous in that it cannot achieve a desired diversity gain when the delay spread<br>
of the channel is relatively small.<br>
The Time Diversity technique efficiently copes with burst errors occurring in a<br>
wireless channel environment using interleaving and coding, and is generally used in a<br>
Doppler spread channel. Disadvantageously, however, the Time Diversity can hardly<br>
obtain the diversity effects in a low-speed Doppler spread channel. The Space Diversity<br>
technique is generally used in a channel with a low delay spread such as an indoor<br>
channel and a pedestrian channel which is a low-speed Doppler spread channel. The<br>
Space Diversity is a technique for achieving a diversity gain using at least two antennas.<br>
In this technique, when a signal transmitted via one antenna is attenuated due to fading,<br>
a signal transmitted via another antenna is received, thereby acquiring a diversity gain.<br>
The Space Diversity is classified into Receive Antenna Diversity using a plurality of<br>
reception antennas and Transmit Antenna Diversity using a plurality of transmission<br>
antennas.<br>
A Receive-Adaptive Antenna Array (Rx-AAA) technique, a kind of the Receive<br>
Antenna Diversity technique, will be described herein below.<br><br>
In the Rx-AAA technique, by calculating a scalar product of an appropriate<br>
weight vector and a signal vector of a reception signal received via an antenna array<br>
comprised of a plurality of reception antennas, a signal received in a direction desired by<br>
a receiver is maximized in its level and a signal received in a direction not desired by the<br>
receiver is minimized in its level. As a result, the Rx-AAA technique amplifies only a<br>
desired reception signal to a maximum level thereby maintaining a high-quality call and<br>
causing an increase in the entire system capacity and service coverage.<br>
Although the Rx-AAA technique can be applied to both a Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access (FDMA) mobile communication system and a Time Division Multiple<br>
Access (TDMA) mobile communication system, it will be assumed herein that the Rx-<br>
AAA technique is applied to a communication system using CDMA techniques<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a "CDMA communication system").<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a BS receiver in a<br>
conventional CDMA mobile communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, the BS receiver<br>
is comprised of N reception antennas (RxANT) of a first reception antenna 111, a<br>
second reception antenna 121, •••, and an Nth reception antenna 131, N radio frequency<br>
(RF) processors of a first RF processor 112, a second RF processor 122, •••, and an Nth<br>
RF processor 132, being mapped to the corresponding reception antennas, N multipath<br>
searchers of a first multipath searcher 113, a second multipath searcher 123, —, and an<br>
Nth multipath searcher 133, being mapped to the corresponding RF processors, L fingers<br>
of a first finger 140-1, a second finger 140-2, •••, and an Lth finger 140-L, for processing<br>
L multipath signals searched by the multipath searchers, a multipath combiner 150 for<br>
combining multipath signals output from the L fingers, a deinterleaver 160, and a<br>
decoder 170.<br>
Signals transmitted by transmitters in a plurality of MSs are received at the N<br>
reception antennas over a multipath fading radio channel. The first reception antenna<br>
111 outputs the received signal to the first RF processor 112. Each of the RF processors<br>
is comprised of an amplifier, a frequency converter, a filter, and an analog-to-digital<br>
(A/D) converter, and processes an RF signal. The first RF processor 112 RF-processes a<br>
signal output from the first reception antenna 111 to convert the signal into a baseband<br>
digital signal, and outputs the baseband digital signal to the first multipath searcher 113.<br>
The first multipath searcher 113 separates L multipath components from a signal output<br><br>
from the first RF processor 112, and the separated L multipath components are output to<br>
the first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L, respectively.<br>
The first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L, being mapped to the L multiple<br>
paths on a one-to-one basis, process the L multipath components. Because the L multiple<br>
paths are considered for each of the signals received via the N reception antennas, signal<br>
processing must be performed on NxL signals, and among the NxL signals, signals on<br>
the same path are output to the same finger.<br>
Similarly, the second reception antenna 121 outputs the received signal to the<br>
second RF processor 122. The second RF processor 122 RF-processes a signal output<br>
from the second reception antenna 121 to convert the signal into a baseband digital<br>
signal, and outputs the baseband digital signal to the second multipath searcher 123. The<br>
second multipath searcher 123 separates L multipath components from a signal output<br>
from the second RF processor 122, and the separated L multipath components are output<br>
to the first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L, respectively.<br>
In this same manner, the Nth reception antenna 131 outputs the received signal<br>
to the Nth RF processor 132. The Nth RF processor 132 RF-processes a signal output<br>
from the Nth reception antenna 131 to convert the signal into a baseband digital signal,<br>
and outputs the baseband digital signal to the Nth multipath searcher 133. The N1<br>
multipath searcher 133 separates L multipath components from a signal output from the<br>
NthRF processor 132, and the separated L multipath components are output to the first<br>
finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L, respectively.<br>
In this way, among the L multipath signals for the signals received via the N<br>
reception antennas, the same multipath signals are input to the same fingers. For<br>
example, first multipath signals from the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception<br>
antenna 131 are input to the first finger 140-1. In the same manner, Lth multipath signals<br>
from the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131 are input to the Lth<br>
finger 140-L. The first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L are different only in signals<br>
input thereto and output therefrom, and are identical in structure and operation.<br>
Therefore, only the first finger 140-1 will be described for simplicity.<br>
The first finger 140-1 is comprised of N despreaders of a first despreader 141, a<br><br>
second despreader 142, •••, and an Nth despreader 143, being mapped to the N multipath<br>
searchers, a signal processor 144 for calculating a weight vector for generating a<br>
reception beam using signals received from the N despreaders, and a reception beam<br>
generator 145 for generating a reception beam using the weight vector calculated by the<br>
signal processor 144.<br>
A first multipath signal output from the first multipath searcher 113 is input to<br>
the first despreader 141. The first despreader 141 despreads the first multipath signal<br>
output from the first multipath searcher 113 with a predetermined spreading code, and<br>
outputs the despread multipath signal to the signal processor 144 and the reception beam<br>
generator 145. Here, the despreading process is called "temporal processing." Similarly,<br>
a first multipath signal output from the second multipath searcher 123 is input to the<br>
second despreader 142. The second despreader 142 despreads the first multipath signal<br>
output from the second multipath searcher 123 with a predetermined spreading code, and<br>
outputs the despread multipath signal to the signal processor 144 and the reception beam<br>
generator 145. In the same way, a first multipath signal output from the Nth multipath<br>
searcher 133 is input to the Nth despreader 143. The Nth despreader 143 despreads the<br>
first multipath signal output from the Nth multipath searcher 133 with a predetermined<br>
spreading code, and outputs the despread multipath signal to the signal processor 144<br>
and the reception beam generator 145.<br>
The signal processor 144 receives the signals output from the first despreader<br>
141 to the Nth despreader 143, and calculates a weight set Wk for generation of<br>
reception beam. Here, a set of first multipath signals output from the first multipath<br>
searcher 113 to the Nth multipath searcher 133 will be defined as "Xk." The first<br>
multipath signal set Xk represents a set of first multipath signals received via the first<br>
reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131 at a kth point, and the first<br>
multipath signals constituting the first multipath signal set Xk are all vector signals.<br>
The weight set Wk represents a set of weights to be applied to the first multipath<br>
signals received via the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131 at<br>
the kth point, and the weights constituting the weight set Wk are all vector signals.<br>
A set of signals determined by despreading all of the first multipath signals in<br>
the first multipath signal set Xk will be defined as yk , The despread signal set yk of<br>
the first multipath signals represents a set of signals determined by despreading the first<br><br>
multipath signals received via the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna<br>
131 at the kth point, and the despread signals constituting despread signal set yk of the<br>
first multipath signals are all vector signals. Here, for the convenience of explanation,<br>
the term "set" will be omitted, and the underlined parameters represent sets of<br>
corresponding elements.<br>
Each of the first despreaders 141 to the Nth despreaders 143 despreads the first<br>
multipath signal Xk with a predetermined despreading code, so that the reception<br>
power of a desired reception signal is greater than the reception power of an interference<br>
signal by a process gain. Here, the despreading code is identical to the spreading code<br>
used in the transmitters of the MSs.<br>
As described above, the despread signal yk of the first multipath signal Xk is<br>
input to the signal processor 144. The signal processor 144 calculates a weight Wk<br>
with the despread signal y of the first multipath signal Xk, and outputs the weight<br>
Wk to the reception beam generator 145. As a result, the signal processor 144 calculates<br>
the weight Wk including a total of N weight vectors applied to the first multipath signal<br>
Xk output from the first reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131, with<br>
the despread signals y of a total of N first multipath signals output from the first<br>
reception antenna 111 to the Nth reception antenna 131. The reception beam generator<br>
145 receives the despread signals y of a total of the N first multipath signals Xk and<br>
a total of the N weight vectors Wk. The reception beam generator 145 generates a<br>
reception beam with a total of the N weight vectors Wk, calculates a scalar product of<br>
the despread signal v of the first multipath signal Xk and the weight Wk<br>
corresponding to the reception beam, and outputs the result as an output zk of the first<br>
finger 140-1. The output Zk of the first finger 140-1 can be expressed as<br><br>
In Equation (1), H denotes a Hermitian operator, i.e. a conjugate-transpose. A<br>
set zk of output signals zk from L fingers in the BS receiver is finally input to the<br>
multipath combiner 150.<br>
Although only the first finger 140-1 has been described, the other fingers are<br><br>
also equal to the first finger 140-1 in operation. Therefore, the multipath combiner 150<br>
combines the signals output from the first finger 140-1 to the Lth finger 140-L, and<br>
outputs the combined signal to the deinterleaver 160. The deinterleaver 160<br>
deinterleaves the signal output from the multipath combiner 150 in a deinterleaving<br>
method corresponding to the interleaving method used in the transmitter, and outputs the<br>
deinterleaved signal to the decoder 170. The decoder 170 decodes the signal output from<br>
the deinterleaver 160 in a decoding method corresponding to the encoding method used<br>
in the transmitter, and outputs the decoded signal as final reception data.<br>
The signal processor 144 calculates a weight Wk such that a Mean Square<br>
Error (MSE) of a signal received from a MS transmitter, desired to be received by a<br>
predetermined algorithm, becomes minimized. The reception beam generator 145<br>
generates a reception beam using the weight Wk generated by the signal processor 144,<br>
and the process of generating a reception beam so that MSE becomes minimized is<br>
called "spatial processing." Therefore, when the Rx-AAA technique is used in a CDMA<br>
mobile communication system, temporal processing and spatial processing are<br>
simultaneously performed. The operation of simultaneously performing temporal<br>
processing and spatial processing is called "spatial-temporal processing."<br>
The signal processor 144 receives multipath signals despread for each finger in<br>
the above-stated manner, and calculates a weight capable of maximizing a gain of the<br>
Rx-AAA technique according to a predetermined algorithm. The signal processor 144<br>
minimizes the MSE. Therefore, a recent study is actively conducted on a weight<br>
calculation algorithm for adaptively minimizing the MSE. However, the weight<br>
calculation algorithm for adaptively minimizing the MSE is an algorithm for reducing<br>
errors on the basis of a reference signal, and this algorithm supports a Consultant<br>
Modulus (CM) technique and a Decision-Directed (DD) technique as a blind technique,<br>
when there is no reference signal.<br>
However, the algorithm for reducing errors on the basis of a reference signal is<br>
hard to converge into a minimum MSE value desired by the system in an environment<br>
where a channel such as a fast fading channel suffers from a rapid change, or an<br>
environment where a high-order modulation scheme such as 16-ary quadrature<br>
amplitude modulation (16QAM) is used. Even though it converges into a particular MSE<br>
value, the minimum MSE value is set to a relatively large value. When the minimum<br><br>
MSE value is set to a relatively large value, a gain occurring by the use of the Rx-AAA<br>
technique is reduced. Therefore, this algorithm is not suitable for a high-speed data<br>
communication system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described<br>
in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or similar<br>
elements are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they are depicted in<br>
different drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known<br>
functions and configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
Before a description of the present invention is given, a model of a reception<br>
signal received at a receiver of a base station (BS) will be considered. It will be assumed<br>
that a receiver of the BS includes a receive-antenna array having a plurality of reception<br>
antennas (Rx ANTs), and the receive-antenna array is generally mounted only in the<br>
receiver of the BS considering its cost and size, and is not mounted in a receiver of a<br>
mobile station (MS). That is, it is assumed that the receiver of the MS includes only one<br>
reception antenna. Although the present invention can be applied to all of mobile<br>
communication systems using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time<br>
Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to a mobile communication system using OFDM (hereinafter<br>
referred to as an "OFDM mobile communication system").<br>
A signal transmitted from a transmitter of an mth MS existing in a cell serviced<br>
by the BS is expressed as<br><br><br>
In Equation (2), sm(t) denotes a transmission signal of an mth MS, pm denotes<br>
transmission power of the mth MS, bm(t) denotes a user information bit sequence of the<br>
mth MS, and cm(t) denotes a user spreading code sequence of the mth MS, having a chip<br>
period of Tc.<br>
The transmission signal transmitted from the MS transmitter is received at a<br>
receiver of the BS over a multipath vector channel. It is assumed that channel parameters<br>
of the multipath vector channel are slowly changed, compared with the bit period Tb<br>
Therefore, it is assumed that the channel parameters of the multipath vector channel are<br>
constant for certain bit periods. A complex baseband reception signal for a first multipath<br>
of an mth MS, received at a receiver of the BS, is expressed by Equation (3). It should be<br>
noted that the reception signal of Equation (3) represents a baseband signal determined<br>
by down-converting a radio frequency (RF) signal received at the BS receiver.<br><br>
In Equation (3), xmt denotes a set of complex baseband reception signals<br>
received through a first multipath of the mth MS, αm1 denotes a fading attenuation<br>
applied to the first multipath of the mth MS, Φm1 denotes a phase transition applied to the<br>
first multipath of the mth MS, τm1 denotes a time delay applied to the first multipath of<br>
the mth MS, and αml denotes a set of array responses (ARs) applied to the first<br>
multipath of the mth MS. Because the BS receiver includes a plurality of, for example, N<br>
reception antennas, a signal transmitted by the mth MS is received at the BS receiver via<br>
the N reception antennas. Therefore, the number of signals received via the first<br>
multipath is N, and N complex baseband reception signals received via the first<br>
multipath of the mth MS constitute a set of the reception signals. Here, for the<br>
convenience of explanation, the term "set" will be omitted, and the underlined<br>
parameters represent sets of corresponding elements.<br>
When a current linear antenna array is used, the array response am1 is defined<br>
as<br><br><br>
In Equation (4), 'd' denotes a distance between separated reception antennas, X<br>
denotes a wavelength at a frequency band in use, N denotes the number of the reception<br>
antennas, and θm1 denotes direction-of-arrival (DOA) applied to the first multipath of the<br>
mth MS.<br>
If it is assumed that the number of MSs existing in a cell serviced by the BS is<br>
M and there are L multiple paths for each of the M MSs, a reception signal received at<br>
the BS becomes the sum of transmission signals transmitted from the M MSs and<br>
additive white noise (AWN), as represented by<br><br>
In Equation (5), n(t) denotes the additive white noise added to the<br>
transmission signals transmitted from the M MSs.<br>
It is assumed that a signal the BS desires to receive in the reception signal of<br>
Equation (5) is x11. The x11 represents a signal a first MS has transmitted via a first<br>
multipath. Because it is assumed that a signal the BS desires to receive is x11, all signals<br>
except the signal x11 are regarded as interference signals and noise. Thus, Equation (5)<br>
can be rewritten as<br><br>
In Equation (6), i(t) denotes an interference signal, which is defined as<br><br><br>
The first term of Equation (7) is a transmission signal of a MS that the BS<br>
desires to receive, but represents the inter-path interference (IPI) by other multiple paths<br>
that the BS does not desire to receive. The second term of Equation (7) represents the<br>
multiple access interference (MAI) by other MSs.<br>
Further, the x(t) is despread with a despreading code c1(t-τ11) previously set in<br>
a first finger (1=1) for a corresponding multipath in a corresponding channel card of the<br>
BS receiver, i.e. a channel card (m=l) assigned to the first MS, and the despread signal<br>
y(t) is defined in Equation (8). The despreading code C1(t-τ11) is identical to the<br>
despreading code c1(t-τ11) used in a BS transmitter during signal transmission. The BS<br>
includes a plurality of receivers described in conjunction with FIG. 1, each of the<br>
receivers is called a "channel card," and one channel card is assigned to one MS. As<br>
described in connection with FIG. 1, the channel card includes as many fingers as the<br>
number of multiple paths, and the fingers are mapped to corresponding multipath signals<br>
on a one-to-one basis.<br><br>
In Equation (8), 'k' denotes a kth sampling point.<br>
When the signal y(t) is generated by despreading the pre-despread signal<br>
x(t) with the despreading code c1(t-τ11), the power of a signal component the BS<br>
receiver desires to receive from among the reception signals is amplified by a gain G<br>
according to a characteristic of a despreader. It is noted that although the power of a<br>
signal component the BS receiver desires to receive is amplified by a process gain G, the<br>
power of the signal components the BS receiver does not desire to receive is not changed<br>
at all. Therefore, a correlation matrix between a reception signal before despreading and<br>
a reception signal after despreading can be calculated. In order to calculate the<br>
correlation matrix between a reception signal before despreading and a reception signal<br>
after despreading, the reception signal x(t) before despreading is sampled at a k' point<br>
which is equal to the sampling point of the reception signal y(t) after despreading. The<br>
signal obtained by sampling the reception signal x(t) before despreading at the kth<br>
point is represented by<br><br><br>
In conclusion, in order to calculate a correlation matrix between a reception<br>
signal x(t) before despreading and a reception signal y(t) after despreading, it is<br>
assumed that the signal of Equation (9) is acquired by sampling the reception signal<br>
x(t) before despreading at the kth point which is equal to the sampling point of the<br>
reception signal y(t) after despreading, and that the reception signal x(t) before<br>
despreading and the reception signal y(t) after despreading are stationary .<br>
A description will now be made of a 2-step Least Mean Square (LMS)<br>
technique and a 2-step Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) technique.<br>
First, the 2-step LMS technique will be described. A set of reception signals<br>
before despreading, including complex reception signals received via N reception<br>
antennas at a particular time, i.e. complex reception signals x1 to xN received via a first<br>
reception antenna to an Nth reception antenna, will be defined as x = [X1,X2,---,XN]T. Here,<br>
'T' is an operator representing a transpose operation. In addition, a set of reception<br>
signals after despreading the complex reception signals x1, x2, •••, xN received via the N<br>
reception antennas will be defined as y=[y1,y2,---,yN]T- The reception signal y after<br>
despreading is determined by the sum of a signal component s the BS receiver desires<br>
to receive and a signal component u the BS receiver does not desire to receive, as<br>
represented by<br><br>
A set of complex weight values to be multiplied by the complex reception<br>
signals x1, x2, •••, XN received via the N reception antennas, i.e. complex weights wi to<br>
wN to be multiplied by complex reception signals x1 to xN received via the first reception<br>
antenna to the N reception antenna, will be defined as w =[w1,w2,•••,wN]T.<br>
An output signal z from fingers in a particular user card, i.e. a channel card<br>
assigned to a particular MS, is determined by calculating a scalar product of the weight<br>
w and the reception signal y after despreading, as represented by<br><br><br>
In Equation (11), 'i' denotes the number of reception antennas.<br>
The output signal z can be classified into a signal component wH s the BS<br>
receiver desires to receive, and a signal component wH u the BS receiver does not<br>
desire to receive, using Equation (10) and Equation (11). The LMS technique minimizes<br>
errors of a known reference signal and a reception signal, and particularly, minimizes a<br>
cost function J(w) given below.<br><br>
In Equation (12), 'J' denotes a cost function, and a weight value w for<br>
minimizing the cost function value J must be determined. Further, in Equation (12), ek<br>
denotes a difference, or an error, between a reception signal and a desired reception<br>
signal, and dk denotes the desired signal. In a beam generation algorithm using a non-<br>
blind technique, a pilot signal is used as the desired signal dk by way of example.<br>
However, the present invention proposes a beam generation algorithm using a blind<br>
technique, so that a detailed description of the beam generation algorithm using the non-<br>
blind technique will be omitted.<br>
In Equation (12), the cost function J is a type of a second-order convex function.<br>
Therefore, in order to minimize the cost function J, the cost function J must be<br>
differentiated so that its value becomes 0. A differentiated value of the cost function J is<br><br>
However, it is difficult to acquire an optimal weight w°pt in an actual channel<br>
environment in a single process, and because the reception signal y after despreading<br>
is input at each point, a recursive formula of Equation (14) should be used in order to<br>
adaptively or recursively acquire the optimal weight wopt.<br><br><br>
In Equation (14), 'k' denotes a kth point, wk denotes a weight at the kth point,<br>
µ denotes a constant gain, and vk denotes a trace vector at the kth point. The trace<br>
vector vk at the kth point represents a vector for converging a differentiated value of the<br>
cost function J to a minimum value, for example, 0.<br>
That is, Equation (14) shows a process of updating a value generated before or<br>
after a constant gain µ from a given weight wk to be used at a current point in a<br>
direction of the trace vector vk as a weight wk+1 to be used at the next point.<br>
In addition, in view of Mean Square (MS), Equation (14) is rewritten as<br><br>
Next, the 2-step MMSE technique will be described. The MMSE technique is a<br>
technique for minimizing errors of a reference signal and a received signal and,<br>
particularly, minimizing a cost function J(w) of Equation (16).<br><br>
In Equation (16), J denotes a cost function, and a value "w" for minimizing the<br>
cost function value J must be calculated. Because the reception signal y after<br>
despreading is input at each point as described in connection with the 2-step LMS<br>
technique, a recursive formula of Equation (17) must be used in order to adaptively or<br>
recursively acquire the optimal weight wopt.<br><br>
As described in connection with the recursive formula for the 2-step LMS<br>
technique, i.e. the recursive formula of Equation (14), in Equation (17), 'k' denotes a kth<br>
point, wk denotes a weight at the kth point, µ denotes a constant gain, and vk denotes<br><br>
a trace vector at the kth point. That is, Equation (17) shows a process of updating a value<br>
generated before or after a constant gain µ from a given weight wk to be used at a<br>
current point in a direction of the trace vector vk as a weight wk+1 to be used at the<br>
next point.<br>
In addition, in view of Mean Square Error (MSE), Equation (17) is rewritten as<br><br>
In Equation (18), the cost function J is expressed as<br><br>
In Equation (19), 'R' denotes an auto-correlation matrix  of<br>
the reception signal, and 'P' denotes a cross-correlation between the<br>
reception signal and a desired reception signal.<br>
An operation for acquiring the optimal weight wopt as described above acts as<br>
the most important factor for generating a reception beam. The present invention<br>
minimizes errors of a reference signal and a reception signal using the 2-step LMS<br>
technique and the 2-step MMSE technique. That is, the present invention acquires the<br>
optimal weight wopt by acquiring the weight w for minimizing a value of the cost<br>
function described in conjunction with Equation (12) and Equation (16). In conclusion,<br>
the present invention proposes a new technique for detecting a desired reception signal<br>
d(k) in Equation (12) and Equation (16).<br>
The technique for detecting a desired reception signal d(k), proposed in the<br>
present invention, is called a "blind technique." Due to the use of the blind technique, a<br>
received signal should be adaptively converged using a particular estimation value, and a<br>
2-step d(k) is used for the adaptive convergence of the received signal. The use of the 2-<br>
step d(k) means that the d(k) is acquired through a first step of a convergence step and a<br>
second step of a stabilization step.<br><br>
The first step of the convergence step will now be described herein below.<br>
First, a constant modulus (CM) technique used for adaptive convergence of the<br>
received signal will be described. The CM technique has been proposed by Godard, and<br>
is generally used in a blind equalizer and also used for a generation algorithm. When the<br>
CM technique proposed by Godard is used, the cost function J is expressed as<br><br>
In Equation (20), 'p' denotes a particular positive integer, and Rp denotes a<br>
Godard modulus. The Godard modulus Rp is defined as<br><br>
Because the current OFDM mobile communication system generally uses a<br>
high-order modulation scheme being higher in order than quadrature phase shift keying<br>
(QPSK) modulation, the cost function J is separated into a real part and an imaginary<br>
part as shown in Equation (22). The reason why the cost function J is separated into a<br>
real part and an imaginary part is because due to use of the high-order modulation<br>
scheme, transmission/reception signals have a real part and an imaginary part.<br><br>
It is assumed herein that the present invention uses the 2-step LMS technique<br>
and the 2-step MMSE technique, and p=2. Therefore, d(k)=R2,R+jR2,1. In addition, it is<br>
assumed that a cost function value J at an initial point, i.e. a k=0 point, is 0 (J=0). This<br>
will be described with reference to FIG. 6.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a CM technique in an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system. Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a CM technique for p=2,<br>
d(k)= R2,R+JR2,1, and J=0 at a point with k=0. That is, if a value R2 is determined by<br>
Equation (22), a circle is generated on a coordinate surface. Then, a received signal is<br>
determined as a point where an extension line drawn from the origin meets the circle. In<br>
FIG. 6, received Zk is projected as a circle.<br>
The convergence step has been described so far. Next, the second step of the<br>
stabilization step for acquiring the d(k) will be described.<br>
If MSE is converged into a predetermined value through the convergence step,<br>
a change occurs from the convergence step to the stabilization step where calculation of<br>
Equation 23 is performed. A process where a change occurs from the convergence step<br>
to the stabilization step as the MSE is converged into a predetermined value will be<br>
described later on.<br><br>
Even in the stabilization step, like in the convergence step, a real part and an<br>
imaginary part are separately calculated. In Equation (23), Pr means that a received<br>
signal is projected as a signal most approximating the desired reception signal d(k) by a<br>
decision-directed (DD) technique. The DD technique is a technique for reflecting the<br>
d(k) as a decision value most approximating the received signal. The DD technique will<br>
now be described herein below with reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a DD technique in an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). Referring to FIG. 7,<br>
because it is assumed that the OFDM mobile communication system uses BPSK, if a<br>
reception signal is (1.2, -0.2) in an I-Q domain, the desired reception signal d(k) is<br>
projected as the largest approximate value of 1 after calculating a distance from +1 and -<br>
1.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a BS receiver according to a<br><br>
first embodiment of the present invention. While describing FIG. 2, it should be noted<br>
that a BS receiver according to the first embodiment of the present invention is similar in<br>
structure to the BS receiver described in connection with FIG. 1, but different in a<br>
method for determining a weight by a signal processor. For simplicity, only the elements<br>
directly related to the present invention in the BS receiver will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2. The first embodiment of the present invention corresponds to an<br>
embodiment where the LMS technique is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, when a reception signal xk at a point k is received, a<br>
despreader 210 despreads the reception signal xk using a predetermined despreading<br>
code, and outputs the despread reception signal y to a signal processor 230 and a<br>
reception beam generator 220. The signal processor 230 is comprised of a weight<br>
calculator 231, a memory 233, and a convergence determiner 235. For simplicity, FIG. 2<br>
will be described with reference to only the first finger 140-1 in the BS receiver of FIG.<br>
1. Therefore, the despreader 210 of FIG. 2 is substantially identical in operation to the N<br>
despreaders of the first despreader 141 to the Nth despreader 143 in the first finger 140-1.<br>
The weight calculator 231 in the signal processor 230 calculates a weight wk<br>
by receiving the despread reception signal yk , a predetermined constant gain µ, an<br>
initial weight w0, and a finger signal zk output from the reception beam generator 220,<br>
and outputs the calculated weight to the memory 233. The memory 233 buffers the<br>
weight wk calculated by the weight calculator 231, and the weight calculator 231 uses<br>
the weight wk stored in the memory 233 when updating the weight wk. That is, the<br>
weight calculator 231 updates a weight wk+l at the next point k+1 using the wk<br>
calculated at the point k. Meanwhile, the weight calculator 231 calculates a weight under<br>
the control of the convergence determiner 235. That is, the convergence determiner 235<br>
determines a technique in which the weight calculator 231 will calculate a weight wk. A<br>
technique for calculating the weight wk is classified into the CM technique and the DD<br>
technique. A process of selecting one of the CM technique and the DD technique by the<br>
convergence determiner 235 will be described herein below.<br>
As described above, because the present invention uses the 2-step d(k), the two<br>
steps of a convergence step and a stabilization step are performed. The CM technique is<br>
disadvantageous in that it has a low convergence speed, and the DD technique is<br><br>
disadvantageous in that it has a high convergence fail rate. Therefore, the present<br>
invention performs a control operation such that the CM technique and the DD<br>
technique are used for the convergence step and the stabilization step according to their<br>
characteristics, thereby securing fast convergence into a small MSE value. Thus, a<br>
process of distinguishing the convergence step and the stabilization step acts as a very<br>
important factor in performance improvement.<br>
The present invention uses the following method to distinguishing the<br>
convergence step and the stabilization step.<br>
MSE at a time domain t = 1, 2, 3, 4, ••• will be defined as "St." That is, the St<br>
represents MSE of a signal received at a particular time 't'. In this case, as a reference<br>
for distinguishing the convergence step and the stabilization step, a difference between St<br>
at a current time t=t, and St-1 at the next time t=t-1 will be defined as "dt." The difference<br>
dt between St and St-1 is defined as<br><br>
That is, a transition occurs from the convergence step to the stabilization step,<br>
when the dt has a value less than or equal to an absolute value of a first threshold dp<br>
(dt
mobile communication system. In conclusion, when the difference dt between St and St-1<br>
is very small, transition occurs from the convergence step to the stabilization step.<br>
FIG. 8 is a graph illustrating a transition condition from a convergence step to a<br>
stabilization step according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG.<br>
8, shows a difference between MSE St-1before of a received signal at a particular time t-1<br>
of a previous duration and MSE Stbefore of a received signal at a current time t of the<br>
previous duration is dtbefore, and a difference between MSE St-1after of a received signal at<br>
a particular time t-1 of a following duration and MSE Stafter of a received signal at a<br>
current time t of the following duration is dtafter. In FIG. 8, the vertical axis represents an<br>
error level, and the horizontal axis represents the number of iterations. Therefore, the<br><br>
"previous duration" represents a duration with a lesser iteration number, and the<br>
"following duration" represents a duration with a greater iteration number. Because a<br>
difference dtbefore between St-1before and Stbefore of the previous duration has a value<br>
exceeding an absolute value of the first threshold dp, the convergence step is maintained<br>
in the previous duration. Because a difference dtafter between St-1after and Stafter of the<br>
following duration has a value less than an absolute value of the first threshold dp,<br>
transition occurs to the stabilization step in the following duration. However, when<br>
transition occurs to the stabilization step on the basis of only the absolute value of the<br>
first threshold dp, an initial convergence domain is not distinguished. In order to<br>
distinguish the initial convergence domain a second threshold dp_reference is defined, and<br>
transition occurs from the convergence step to the stabilization step when the St has a<br>
value less than the second threshold dp_reference while the dt has a value less than or equal<br>
to the absolute value of the first threshold dp (dt
In FIG. 2, using the difference dt between St and St-1, the convergence<br>
determiner 235 determines if the weight calculator 231 will use the CM technique or the<br>
DD technique according to whether or not an MSE value of a received signal was<br>
converged into the first threshold dp and the St is less than the second threshold dp_reference-<br>
That is, the convergence determiner 235 allows the weight calculator 231 to use the CM<br>
technique in the convergence step, and allows the weight calculator 231 to use the DD<br>
technique in the stabilization step.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception procedure by a BS receiver<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, in step 311,<br>
a BS receiver sets up an initial weight w0, a constant gain u, a first threshold dp, and a<br>
second threshold dp_reference, and sets both an initial auto-correlation matrix R(0) of a<br>
reception signal xk and an initial cross-correlation matrix P(0) between the reception<br>
signal xk and a desired reception signal dk, to '0', and then proceeds to step 313. In<br>
step 313, the BS receiver determines if the communication is ended. If it is determined<br>
that the communication is ended, the BS receiver ends the ongoing procedure.<br>
If it is determined in step 313 that the communication is not ended, the BS<br>
receiver proceeds to step 315. In step 315, the BS receiver receives a despread signal<br>
yk for the reception signal xk, and then proceeds to step 317. In step 317, the BS<br>
receiver calculates a set z_k of signals zk output from respective fingers of the BS<br><br>
receiver using the despread signal y and a weight wk (zk = w" y ), and then<br>
proceeds to step 319. The zk represents a set of finger output signals generated using a<br>
reception beam generated using the weight wk. In step 319, the BS receiver calculates<br>
an error function ek, and a difference between the reception signal xk and the desired<br>
reception signal dk according to the CM technique (ek=dk,CM-Zk) because the BS receiver<br>
is initially in the convergence step, and then proceeds to step 321.<br>
In step 321, the BS receiver calculates a differentiated value of a cost function<br>
using the despread signal y and the error function ek (J(wk) = -2e kyk ), and then<br>
proceeds to step 323. In step 323, the BS receiver calculates a beam generation<br>
coefficient, or a weight (wk = wk-1 - µyk e k), and then proceeds to step 325. In step 325,<br>
the BS receiver determines if a difference dt between St and St-1 satisfies a convergence<br>
condition, i.e. if the dt is less than or equal to an absolute value of the first threshold dp<br>
and the St is less than the second threshold dp_reference (dt
greater than an absolute value of the first threshold dp or the St is greater than or equal to<br>
the second threshold dp_reference, the BS receiver proceeds to step 327. In step 327, the BS<br>
receiver maintains the calculated weight wk, and proceeds to step 329. In step 329, the<br>
BS receiver delays by a predetermined unit time, and then proceeds to step 331. The<br>
reason for delaying by the predetermined unit time is to use a value determined at a k'<br>
snap for a (k+l)th snap, i.e. to take a state transition delay into consideration. In step 331,<br>
the BS receiver increases the k by 1, i.e. transitions from the current point k to the next<br>
point k+1, and then returns to step 313.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 325 that the dt is less than or equal to an<br>
absolute value of the first threshold dp and the St is less than the second threshold<br>
dp_reference, the BS receiver proceeds to step 333. In step 333, the BS receiver delays by a<br>
predetermined unit time, and then proceeds to step 335. Also, the reason for delaying by<br>
the predetermined unit time is to take into consideration the state transition delay. In step<br>
335, the BS receiver increases the k by 1, i.e. transitions from the current point k to the<br>
next point k+1, and then returns to step 337. In step 337, the BS receiver determines if<br>
the communication is ended. If it is determined that the communication is ended, the BS<br>
receiver ends the ongoing procedure.<br>
If it is determined in step 337 that the communication is not ended, the BS<br><br>
receiver proceeds to step 339. In step 339, the BS receiver calculates an error function ek,<br>
and a difference between the reception signal xk and the desired reception signal dk<br>
according to the DD technique (ek=dk,DD-Zk) because the BS receiver is currently in the<br>
stabilization step, and then proceeds to step 341. In step 341, the BS receiver calculates a<br>
differentiated value of a cost function using the despread signal y and the error<br>
function and then proceeds to step 343. In step 343, the BS<br>
receiver calculates a beam generation coefficient, or a weight , and<br>
then proceeds to step 345. In step 345, the BS receiver maintains the calculated weight<br>
wk, and proceeds to step 333.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a BS receiver according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. While describing FIG. 4, it should be noted<br>
that a BS receiver according to the second embodiment of the present invention is<br>
similar in structure to the BS receiver described in connection with FIG. 1, but different<br>
in a method for determining a weight by a signal processor. For simplicity, only the<br>
elements directly related to the present invention in the BS receiver will be described<br>
with reference to FIG. 4. The second embodiment of the present invention corresponds to<br>
an embodiment where the MMSE technique is used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, when a reception signal xk at a point k is received, a<br>
despreader 410 despreads the reception signal xk using a predetermined despreading<br>
code, and outputs the despread reception signal y to a signal processor 430 and a<br>
reception beam generator 420. The signal processor 430 is comprised of a reception<br>
correlation matrix calculator 431, a weight calculator 433, a memory 435, a convergence<br>
determiner 437 and a memory 439. For simplicity, FIG. 4 will be described with<br>
reference to only the first finger 140-1 in the BS receiver of FIG. 1. Therefore, the<br>
despreader 410 of FIG. 4 is substantially identical in operation to the N despreaders of<br>
the first despreader 141 to the Nth despreader 143 in the first finger 140-1. The reception<br>
correlation matrix calculator 431 of the reception processor 430 receives the despread<br>
reception signal y , calculates a reception correlation matrix using a predetermined<br>
constant gain p., and buffers the calculated reception correlation matrix in the memory<br>
439. The memory 439 buffers the reception correlation matrix calculated by the<br>
reception correlation matrix calculator 431, and the reception correlation matrix<br>
calculator 431 uses the reception correlation matrix stored in the memory 439 when<br><br>
updating the reception correlation matrix buffered therein. The "correlation matrix"<br>
refers to the auto-correlation matrix R and the cross-correlation matrix P.<br>
The weight calculator 433 calculates a weight wk by receiving the despread<br>
reception signal _yk, a predetermined constant gain µ, an initial weight w0, and a finger<br>
signal zk output from the reception beam generator 420, and outputs the calculated<br>
weight to the memory 435. The memory 435 buffers the weight wk calculated by the<br>
weight calculator 433, and the weight calculator 433 uses the weight wk stored in the<br>
memory 435 when updating the weight wk. That is, the weight calculator 433 updates a<br>
weight wk+1 at the next point k+1 using the wk calculated at the point k. Meanwhile,<br>
the weight calculator 433 calculates a weight under the control of the convergence<br>
determiner 437 in the method described in connection with the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. That is, as described in the first embodiment, the convergence<br>
determiner 437 determines a technique in which the weight calculator 433 will calculate<br>
a weight wk.<br>
FIG. 5 is a flowchart illustrating a signal reception procedure by a BS receiver<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, in step<br>
511, a BS receiver sets up an initial weight w0, a constant gain µ, a first threshold dp,<br>
and a second threshold dp_reference, and sets both an initial auto-correlation matrix R(0) of<br>
a reception signal xk and an initial cross-correlation matrix P(0) between the reception<br>
signal xk and a desired reception signal dk, to '0', and then proceeds to step 513. In<br>
step 513, the BS receiver determines if the communication is ended. If it is determined<br>
that the communication is ended, the BS receiver ends the ongoing procedure.<br>
If it is determined in step 513 that the communication is not ended, the BS<br>
receiver proceeds to step 515. In step 515, the BS receiver receives a despread signal<br>
y for the reception signal xk, and then proceeds to step 517. In step 517, the BS<br>
receiver calculates a set zk of signals zk output from respective fingers of the BS<br>
receiver using the despread signal y and a weight wk  and then<br>
proceeds to step 519. The zk represents a set of finger output signals generated using a<br>
reception beam. In step 519, the BS receiver calculates the reception correlation matrixes,<br>
i.e. auto-correlation matrix Rk and a cross-correlation matrix Pk according to the CM<br>
technique because the BS receiver is initially in the convergence step, and then proceeds<br><br>
to step 521. A process of calculating the auto-correlation matrix Rk and the cross-<br>
correlation matrix Pk is expressed as<br><br>
In Equation (25), T is a forgetting factor and denotes only a value of the<br>
immediately previous step.<br>
In step 521, the BS receiver calculates a differentiated value of a cost function<br>
using the auto-correlation matrix Rk and the cross-correlation matrix Pk<br>
  and then proceeds to step 523. In step 523, the BS receiver<br>
calculates a beam generation coefficient, or a weight and then<br>
proceeds to step 525. In step 525, the BS receiver determines if a difference dt between<br>
St and St-i satisfies a convergence condition, i.e. if the dt is less than or equal to an<br>
absolute value of the first threshold dp and the St is less than the second threshold<br>
  If the dt is less than or equal to an absolute value of the<br>
first threshold dp and the St is less than the second threshold dp_reference, i-e. if the dt is<br>
greater than an absolute value of the first threshold dp or the St is greater than or equal to<br>
the second threshold dp_reference, the BS receiver proceeds to step 527. In step 527, the BS<br>
receiver maintains the calculated weight wk, and proceeds to step 529. In step 529, the<br>
BS receiver delays by a predetermined unit of time, and then proceeds to step 531. The<br>
reason for delaying by the predetermined unit of time is to take into consideration a state<br>
transition delay. In step 531, the BS receiver increases the k by 1, i.e. transitions from<br>
the current point k to the next point k+1, and then returns to step 513.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 525 that the dt is less than or equal to an<br>
absolute value of the first threshold dp and the St is less than the second threshold<br>
dp_reference, the BS receiver proceeds to step 533. In step 533, the BS receiver delays by a<br>
predetermined unit of time, and the proceeds to step 535. Also, the reason for delaying<br>
by the predetermined unit of time is to take into consideration the state transition delay.<br>
In step 535, the BS receiver increases the k by 1, i.e. transitions from the current point k<br>
to the next point k+1, and then returns to step 537. In step 537, the BS receiver<br>
determines if the communication is ended. If it is determined that the communication is<br><br>
ended, the BS receiver ends the ongoing procedure.<br>
If it is determined in step 537 that the communication is not ended, the BS<br>
receiver proceeds to step 539. In step 539, the BS receiver calculates the reception<br>
correlation matrixes, i.e. auto-correlation matrix Rk and a cross-correlation matrix Pk<br>
according to the DD technique because the BS receiver is currently in the stabilization<br>
step, and then proceeds to step 541. A process of calculating the auto-correlation matrix<br>
Rk and the cross-correlation matrix Pk is expressed as<br><br>
In step 541, the BS receiver calculates a differentiated value of a cost function<br>
using the auto-correlation matrix Rk and the cross-correlation matrix Pk<br>
  and then proceeds to step 543. In step 543, the BS receiver<br>
calculates a beam generation coefficient, or a weight and then<br>
proceeds to step 545. In step 545, the BS receiver maintains the calculated weight wk,<br>
and proceeds to step 533.<br>
With reference to FIG. 9, a description will now be made of a simulation result<br>
on a 2-step weight generation technique according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention and a general weight generation technique.<br>
FIG. 9 is a graph illustrating a characteristic curve for a general weight<br>
generation technique and a 2-step weight generation technique according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, it is noted that an MSE value<br>
against the number of iterations for the 2-step weight generation technique according to<br>
the present invention is converged into a less value, compared with an MSE value<br>
against the number of iterations for the conventional weight generation technique, e.g., a<br>
DD technique. That the MSE value is converged into a less value means that a reception<br>
beam can be correctly generated, making it possible to correctly receive only a desired<br>
reception signal.<br>
With reference to FIG. 10, a description will now be made of a simulation result<br><br>
on a characteristic of a 2-step weight generation technique according to the number of<br>
reception antennas for which a smart antenna is used.<br>
FIG. 10 is a graph illustrating a characteristic curve according to the number of<br>
reception antennas of a BS receiver for a 2-step weight generation technique according<br>
to the embodiments of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 10, there is illustrated a<br>
radiation pattern for a BS receiver having 6 reception antennas and a BS receiver having<br>
10 reception antennas. For example, if it is assumed that a particular BS is located at 57°,<br>
it is noted that compared with the BS receiver having 6 reception antennas, the BS<br>
receiver having 10 reception antennas has a normalized antenna gain of about 0.2, and<br>
can more correctly generate a reception beam. In conclusion, in terms of capacity of an<br>
OFDM mobile communication system, an increase in the number of the reception<br>
antennas causes an increase in the amplitude of the reception signals enabling a correct<br>
communication, thereby contributing to an increase in system capacity.<br>
FIG. 11 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of an OFDM mobile<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring<br>
to FIG. 11, the OFDM communication system is comprised of a transmitter, or a MS<br>
transmitter 1100, and a receiver, or a BS receiver 1150.<br>
First, the MS transmitter 1100 will be described. The MS transmitter 1100 is<br>
comprised of a symbol mapper 1111, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 1113, a pilot<br>
pattern inserter 1115, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) block 1117, a parallel-to-<br>
serial (P/S) converter 1119, a guard interval inserter 1121, a digital-to-analog (D/A)<br>
converter 1123, and a radio frequency (RF) processor 1125.<br>
When there are information data bits to be transmitted, the information data bits<br>
are input to the symbol mapper 1111. The symbol mapper 1111 modulates the input<br>
information data bits in a predetermined modulation scheme for symbol mapping, and<br>
outputs the symbol-mapped data bits to the serial-to-parallel converter 1113. Here,<br>
quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) or 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation<br>
(16QAM) can be used as the modulation scheme. The serial-to-parallel converter 1113<br>
parallel-converts serial modulation symbols output from the symbol mapper 1111, and<br>
outputs the parallel-converted modulation symbols to the pilot pattern inserter 1115. The<br>
pilot pattern inserter 1115 inserts pilot patterns in the parallel-converted modulation<br><br>
symbols output from the serial-to-parallel converter 1113, and then outputs the pilot<br>
pattern-inserted modulation symbols to the IFFT block 1117.<br>
The IFFT block 1117 performs N-point IFFT on the signals output from the<br>
pilot pattern inserter 1115, and outputs the resultant signals to the parallel-to-serial<br>
converter 1119. The parallel-to-serial converter 1119 serial-converts the signals output<br>
form the IFFT block 1117, and outputs the serial-converted signals to the guard interval<br>
inserter 1121. The guard interval inserter 1121 receives the signal output from the<br>
parallel-to-serial converter 1119, inserts a guard interval therein, and outputs the guard<br>
interval-inserted signal to the digital-to-analog converter 1123. The guard interval is<br>
inserted to remove interference between a previous OFDM symbol transmitted at a<br>
previous OFDM symbol time and a current OFDM symbol to be transmitted at a current<br>
OFDM symbol time in an OFDM communication system. For the guard interval, a<br>
cyclic prefix method or a cyclic postfix method is used. In the cyclic prefix method, a<br>
predetermined number of last samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain are copied<br>
and inserted into a valid OFDM symbol. In the cyclic postfix method, a predetermined<br>
number of first samples of an OFDM symbol in a time domain are copied and inserted<br>
into a valid OFDM symbol.<br>
The digital-to-analog converter 1123 analog-converts the signal output from the<br>
guard interval inserter 1121, and outputs the analog-converted signal to the RF processor<br>
1125. The RF processor 1125, including a filter and a front-end unit, RF-processes the<br>
signal output from the digital-to-analog converter 1123 such that the signal can be<br>
actually transmitted over the air, and transmits the RF-processed signal over the air via a<br>
transmission antenna.<br>
Next, the BS receiver 1150 will be described. The BS receiver 1150 is<br>
comprised of an RF processor 1151, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 1153, a<br>
reception beam generator 1155, a signal processor 1157, a guard interval remover 1159,<br>
a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter 1161, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) block 1163, an<br>
equalizer 1165, a pilot symbol extractor 1167, a synchronization &amp; channel estimation<br>
unit 1169, a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter 1171, and a symbol demapper 1173.<br>
The signals transmitted by the MS transmitter 1100 are received via reception<br>
antennas of the BS receiver 1150, the received signal experiencing a multipath channel<br><br>
and having a noise component. The signals received via the reception antennas are input<br>
to the RF processor 1151, and the RF processor 1151 down-converts the signals received<br>
via the reception antennas into an intermediate frequency (IF) signal, and outputs the IF<br>
signal to the analog-to-digital converter 1153. The analog-to-digital converter 1153<br>
digital-converts an analog signal output from the RF processor 1151, and outputs the<br>
digital-converted signal to the reception beam generator 1155 and the signal processor<br>
1157. Operations of the reception beam generator 1155 and the signal processor 1157<br>
have been described with reference to the first and second embodiments of the present<br>
invention, so a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
The signal output from the reception beam generator 1155 is input to the guard<br>
interval remover 1159. The guard interval remover 1159 removes a guard interval from<br>
the signal output from the reception beam generator 1155, and outputs the resultant<br>
signal to the serial-to-parallel converter 1161. The serial-to-parallel converter 1161<br>
parallel-converts the serial signal output from the guard interval remover 1159, and<br>
outputs the resultant signal to the FFT block 1163. The FFT block 1163 performs N-<br>
point FFT on the signal output from the serial-to-parallel converter 1161, and outputs the<br>
resultant signal to the equalizer 1165 and the pilot symbol extractor 1167. The equalizer<br>
1165 performs channel equalization on the signal output from the FFT block 1163, and<br>
outputs a resultant signal to the parallel-to-serial converter 1171. The parallel-to-serial<br>
converter 1171 serial-converts the parallel signal output from the equalizer 1165, and<br>
outputs a resultant signal to the symbol demapper 1173. The symbol demapper 1173<br>
demodulates the signal output from the parallel-to-serial converter 1171 using a<br>
demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme used in the MS<br>
transmitter 1100, and outputs a resultant signal as received information data bits.<br>
Further, the signal output from the FFT block 1163 is input to the pilot symbol<br>
extractor 1167, and the pilot symbol extractor 1167 extracts pilot symbols from the<br>
signal output from the FFT block 1163, and outputs the extracted pilot symbols to the<br>
synchronization &amp; channel estimation unit 1169. The synchronization &amp; channel<br>
estimation unit 1169 performs synchronization and channel estimation on the pilot<br>
symbols output from the pilot symbol extractor 1167, and outputs the result to the<br>
equalizer 1165.<br>
As is understood from the foregoing description, the mobile communication<br><br>
system generates a weight using a 2-step weight generation technique, or a CM<br>
technique, in a convergence step, and generates a weight using a DD technique in a<br>
stabilization step, thereby making it possible to rapidly generate a weight with a<br>
minimum MSE value. Therefore, it is possible to generate a correct reception beam, and<br>
the correct reception of a reception beam allows a receiver to correctly receive only a<br>
desired signal, thereby improving system performance.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
