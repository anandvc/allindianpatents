System casing for transverse joints in fixed carriageways<br>
The invention relates to system casing for producing transverse joints between segments of a fixed carriageway composed of concrete, bitumen or the like with holders for casing boards disposed laterally outside the segments.<br>
In the case of a railway superstructure in the form of a fixed carriageway composed of concrete or other cast compounds (e.g. Rheda constructions), the carriageway plate - and this is particularly the case on artificial structures such as bridges - is not formed as a continuous concrete layer, but as plural consecutive carriageway segments.<br>
The problem is that before the casting of the individual segments, casings have to be produced which must withstand the pressure of the fresh concrete and thus ensure clean, straight joints between the individual carriageway segments. At the end of the concreting operation, moreover, such a casing must be provided in order to form a clean termination. Generally, the joint casings are formed of strong wooden boards, which span the entire carriageway plate breadth and are fixed to the side casing by the outermost ends. This turns out to be very expensive, particularly in the case of sections in which many joints are to be produced. Furthermore, the removal of the casing after concreting, in order to expose the joint, is often associated with difficulties and partial destruction of the casing material, particularly if the rails are already fitted over the joints.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to create a system casing which both substantially simplifies the manufacture and dismantling of the casing for such transverse joints between segments of a fixed carriageway and at the same time ensures that as little casing material as possible is damaged and thus made unusable for further stages of operation.<br><br>
To achieve this, a system casing of the type mentioned in the introduction is characterised by holders that may be clamped to the rails for the insertion of carrying profiles to be disposed transverse to the rails over the transverse joint, in which case downward-oriented reinforcement profiles may bear on the said carrying profiles in order to support the casing boards.<br>
With the solution according to the invention, the fundamental disadvantage of prior casings for such transverse joints is avoided, namely the fixing of the casing boards to the side casings of the segments. This ensures not only a correlation of the transverse joint production with the casing-in and de-casing operations of the side casings, but has the fundamental disadvantage that very long casing boards are required. These must furthermore be extremely strong in order not to bend, since it is not possible to support these except at the ends. By the clamping of holders to the rails according to the invention, in particular to the rail feet, the casing system according to the invention is fully independent of the side casings, i.e. the casing-in and de-casing of the transverse joints can be carried out independently of the casing-in and de-casing of the side casing. Furthermore, with the carrying profile disposed over the transverse joint, on which profile a plurality of reinforcement profiles can be mounted, the particularly advantageous option is gained, by the provision of a corresponding number of such reinforcement profiles, of giving multiple support to the casing boards over the entire length of the transverse joint, so that not only can relatively thin casing boards be used, which are obviously substantially cheaper than thick, bending-resistant casing boards, but plural mutually abutting casing board sections can be used.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, it can be provided that the reinforcement profiles of a carrying plate which is displaceable along the carrying profiles and is clampable thereto comprise downward-oriented support arms, the thickness of the support arms preferably decreasing slightly conically downward transverse to the transverse joint. This means that the support arms between the casing boards, which are correspondingly arranged in a slightly V-<br><br>
shaped manner, sloping to left and right, can be very easily removed in an upward direction even if these casing boards are pressed very firmly against the support arms by the pressure of the concrete slab.<br>
Each reinforcement profile may preferably have two support arms spaced in the longitudinal direction of the carrying profiles, and these form virtually a type of support fork. To mount the reinforcement profiles on the carrying profile disposed over the transverse joint, it can either be provided that the carrying profile is clampable between the carrying plate and the clamping plate by means of clamping screws, or that over the carrying plate a transverse channel is formed for mounting over a carrying profile, into which a clamping screw penetrating the upper covering wall in a threaded bore projects.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, it can be provided that the holders are clampable to the rail foot, in which case the side parts of the holders flanking the tail foot are provided with transverse recesses for the carrying profiles.<br>
In order to simplify assembly and dismantling of the carrying profile bridging the entire gap between the side casings, the carrying profile is to be formed of plural mutually abutting carrying profile sections, which are detachably connectable to one another in a butt joint by connecting parts. These connecting parts may in the simplest case be the sleeves receiving the carrying profile sections, which are provided with clamping screws, which can bear on the two mutually abutting carrying profile sections.<br>
The advantageous possibility of clamping the holders to the rail foot, whereby the transverse recesses for the insertion of the carrying profiles come to rest under the rail foot, can be particularly advantageously arranged since in such fixed carriageways, the rails do not rest directly on the concrete of the fixed carriageway, but rather on individual support points or sleepers, whose rests for the rails project above the surface of the subsequently cast solid carriageway.<br><br>
It is thus possible for the carrying profile resting directly below the rail feet still to lie above the fixed carriageway, so that these carrying profiles are not concreted in.<br>
As was mentioned above, casing boards may be applied on both sides to the reinforcement profiles and are fixable by projections overlapping the boards to the underside of the carrying plates, whose external distance corresponds to the desired transverse joint width. In other words, the transverse joint width corresponds to the width, measured transverse to the joint, of the support arms plus twice the thickness of a casing board.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the invention will appear from the following description of an embodiment and from the drawings, which show:<br>
Fig. 1 a plan view of a section of a fixed carriageway with rails mounted on double-block sleepers and with a system casing fixed thereto for producing a transverse joint,<br>
Fig. 2, an enlarged perspective view of a holder clamped to the rail foot for the carrying profile for the reinforcement profile to be disposed over the transverse joint,<br>
Fig. 3, a connecting part for connecting the carrying profile sections,<br>
Fig. 4, an enlarged perspective view of one of the reinforcement profiles, which are mounted on the carrying profile and are held clamped thereto,<br>
Figures 5-12, a section through the carriageway according to Fig. 1 in various stages of insertion of the system casing, and<br><br>
Figures 13-19, a section through the finished fixed carriageway with fully concreted-in carriageway plate during the various stages of de-casing of the system casing according to the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, on the hydraulically-bound carrying face of the surface of the artificial structure 1, two block sleepers 2 are laid, in which the reinforcement 3 between the blocks 4 only partially concreted in projects in the centre and below these blocks, so that improved bonding of the fixed carriageway in the concrete is obtained.<br>
On the arranged sleepers 2, the rails 5 are respectively disposed on sleeper rests 6 of the concrete blocks 4 and are fixed conventionally. In order to produce a transverse joint between segments of a fixed carriageway of concrete, a system casing is provided, which consists of holders 7, which are mounted on and clamped to the rail feet 8 of the rails 5; of a carrying profile 9 which is to be mounted over the transverse joint and which consists of plural sections, its individual sections 9a, 9b, 9c being connected together by connecting parts 10; and of downward-oriented reinforcement profiles 11, which are mounted on the carrying profile 9 and on which the laterally applied casing boards 12 and 13 bear.<br>
As can be deduced from Fig. 2 in particular, the clamping plate support consists of a plate 14 with a left hook member 15 for hooking on to the rail foot and right-hand clamping hooks with clamping plates 17 braceable by clamping screws 16 against the upper face of the rail foot. Between the two spaced plate sections 14 of the holder 7 is a transverse recess 18 into which the carrying profile 9, consisting of the sections 9a, 9b and 9c, is insertable. Before mutual abutment of the carrying profiles, the connecting parts 10 shown in Fig, 3 are mounted, and are then placed symmetrically over a butt joint and are clamped by means of the clamping screws 19 pressing on to the carrying profile.<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows in detail the structure of the reinforcement profile with two fork-like downward-projecting support arms 20, which project from the underside of a carrying plate 21. By spaced profiles 22 and a cover plate 23, which may be welded on for example or mounted in another manner - and optionally this arrangement could also be in one piece - a transverse channel 24 is formed, which is for the mounting of the reinforcement profile 11 on the carrying profile 9, in which case by a clamping screw 25 penetrating the cover wall 23 in a threaded bore, clamping of the reinforcement profile 11 can be effected at any point on the carrying profile 9. The support arms 20 taper conically downward, so that the casing boards applied thereto and fixed by projections 26 overlapping their upper edge are also arranged slightly conically, thus producing a transverse joint which opens conically upwards. This formation has the advantage that even if the pressure of the concrete presses the casing boards very firmly against the support arms 20, these can finally be easily pulled out from above, which will be described more fully below.<br>
With the aid of Figures 5 to 12, the assembly principle of the system casing according to the invention will be described, wherein this casing extends between the side casings 27 for the segments of the fixed carriageway to be concreted in, but which is fully independent of this side casing and also can be assembled and dismantled independently thereof.<br>
As Fig. 5 shows, over the planned transverse joint in the space between sleepers, the holders 7 are fixed to the rail feet and then (Fig. 6) the outer carrying profile sections 9a and 9c are inserted into the gaps 18 between holders 7. The reinforcement profiles 11 are mounted on the outer carrying profiles 9a and 9c mounted on the holders and then also a sufficient number of reinforcement profiles are mounted on the inner carrying profile section 9b not yet assembled. None of the reinforcement profiles should at this moment already be fixed in position by means of the fixing screws 25, in order to permit subsequent, more accurate positioning (Fig. 7).<br><br>
Fig. 8 shows that thereafter the connecting parts 10 are mounted on the inner ends of the two outer carrying profile sections 9a and 9c and that the inner carrying profile section 9b is then interposed. By corresponding displacement of the connecting parts and tightening by means of the fixing screws 19, a rigid, supporting connection is obtained between the carrying profile sections 9a, 9b and 9c to form a carrying profile disposed over the transverse joint to be formed in the fixed carriageway. Fig. 8 shows the mounting of the connecting parts 10 on the carrying profile sections, Fig. 9 the insertion of the inner carrying profile section between the outer carrying profile sections, and Fig. 10 the fixing of the inner carrying profile section by means of the connecting parts 10.<br>
The carrying profile sections connected together as a unit are aligned symmetrically to the track axis in the guides of the holders 7 and then the reinforcement profiles 11 are positioned as evenly as possible along the carrying profile 9 and are fixed in position on the carrying profile 9 with their fixing screw 25. In this case, the two reinforcement forks should be positioned next to the rail feet in the inside of the track, i.e. between the rails, as close as possible to the holders 7, in order later to permit problem-free removal of the outer carrying profile sections 9a, 9c (Fig. 11).<br>
As Fig. 12 shows, then the casing boards 12 and 13 likewise formed of plural sections 12a, 12b and 12c, and 13a, 13b and 13c respectively are leaned against the two sides of the system casing support assembled in the manner described above and are pinched under the carrying plates 21 by means of the projections 26. They do not have to be additionally fixed by special means, as the pressure of the concrete will press them against the carrying structure. The division of the casing board between the side casings 27 into plural sections has the advantage that removal from the fully concreted joint is made easier, whilst the side casing and the rails are still present in the joint region.<br>
The principle of dismantling the system casing according to the invention will be described with the aid of Figures 13 to 19.<br><br>
First the connecting parts 10 are loosened and are pushed on to the outer carrying profile sections 9a and 9c (Fig. 13). Then, the inner carrying profile section 9b thus exposed with the reinforcement profile 11 fixed thereto are lifted up (Fig. 14). The connecting parts 10 can be completely removed from the now interrupted carrying profile (Fig. 15).<br>
Fig. 16 shows how then the two outer carrying profile sections 9c and 9a are pushed inwards one after another and can be removed from above. At this point, it can be deduced that it was important to place the reinforcement profiles 11 in the region between the rails 5 as close as possible to the holders 7 in order that the outer carrying profile sections 9a and 9c can be removed along the full length (Fig. 16).<br>
By removing all carrying profile sections, all the reinforcement profiles are then exposed at the top and can be removed in the vertical direction from the joint, this removal being simplified by the conical downward tapering of the support arms (Fig. 17).<br>
By the removal of the reinforcement forks, clear space is created in the joint. Thus the casing board sections can be braced away from the concrete surface and released. In the region between the rails, the casing board sections can be removed from the joint (Fig. 18).<br>
Lastly, as is shown in Fig. 19, the holders 7 are released and removed from the rail feet 8.<br>
It can be deduced from this that the entire procedure can be carried out even before the side casing or even the rails are removed.<br><br><br>
