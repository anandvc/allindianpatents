				<td>The present invention relates to certain 2,6-disubstituted pyridines and 2,4-disubstituted pyrimidines, their preparation and use as herbicides.<br>
Pyridines, pyrimidines and their derivatives have many uses in the pharmaceutical area as well as in agriculture (herbicides, fungicides, acaricides, anthelmintics, bird repellents), reagents, intermediates and chemicals for the polymer and textile industry.<br>
2-Arylpyrimidines and 2-pyrimidinyl-6-arylpyridines for example have been described as fungicides (DE 40 29 654 and JO 2131-480, respectively). EP 263,958 is concerned with herbicidal 2,6-diphenylpyridines, and structurally related 2,4-diphenylpyrimidines have been disclosed in EP 354,766 and 425,247, respectively, which are also said to be herbicides. Another example are 2,6-diphenoxypyridines, which have been published in EP 572,093 as herbicides. 4-Phenoxy-2-pyrazol-1-yl-pyrimidines are disclosed in DE 29 35 578 to have fungicidal activity. Huelsen (Diplomarbeit, Konstanz 1993) describes four distinct 2-(1-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-pyrazol-5-ylyoxy)-6-phenyl pyridines, however, no biological activity is disclosed.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that good herbicidal activity is present in related, novel pyridine and pyrimidine derivatives having both an aryl group and an aryloxy or a heteroaryloxy group. These compounds unexpectedly show excellent activity and good crop selectivity in pre-and post-emergence applications on both broadleaf and grassy weed species.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides 2,6-substituted pyridines and 2,4-substituted pyrimidines of the general formula l<br>
wherein<br>
A represents an optionally substituted aryl group or an optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered<br>
nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic group or a difluorobenzodioxolyl group;<br>
m represents an integer from 0 to 5;<br>
n represents an integer from 0 to 2;<br>
R1 (or each R1) independently represents a halogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
alkinyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, dialkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkoxy, alkylthio, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino,<br>
alkoxyamino or formamidino group;<br>
R2 (or each R2) independently represents a halogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl,<br>
alkinyl, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkylthio or<br>
pentahalosulphonyl group or a nitro, cyano, SF5 or a alkylsulphonyl or alkylsulfinyl group;<br>
X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom; and<br>
Z represents a nitrogen atom or a CH group;<br>
with the proviso that if A represents a 1-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-pyrazol-5-yl group, n is 0, X<br>
represents an oxygen atom and Z represents a CH group ,<br>
then m is other than zero and R2m is other than 3-trifluoromethyl, 2,4-dichloro or 2,4-dimethyl.<br>
An aryl group as substituent or part of other substituents or in the definition of A is suitably an optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl group. Within the definition of A the 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl group comprises optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered heterocycles containing nitrogen or one nitrogen and one or more nitrogen and/or oxygen and/or sulfur atoms, 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms being preferred. Examples of such groups are pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl and triazinyl groups. As far as A is concerned the definition "aryl" does also include bicyclic systems which consist of a benzene ring condensed with a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring as defined above and in turn the 5- or 6-membered heterocycles may be condensed with a benzene ring. Another preferred embodiment of A is a difluorobenzodioxolyl group of formula<br>
Generally, if any of the above mentioned moieties comprises an alkyl, alkenyl or alkinyl group, such groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain 1 to 12, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl, allyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl and tertiary-butyl groups. The alkyl portion of a haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylthio or alkoxy group suitably has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably 1 or 2 carbon atoms. The number of carbon atoms in the alkoxyalkyl, alkoxyalkoxy or dialkoxyalkyl groups is up to 6, preferably up to 4, e.g. methoxymethyl, methoxymethoxy, methoxyethyl, ethoxymethyl, ethoxyethoxy, dimethoxymethyl.<br>
"Halogen" means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Haloalkyl and haloalkoxy are preferably mono-, di- or trifluoroalkyl and -alkoxy, especially trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy.<br>
When any groups are designated as being optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally present may be any of those customarily employed in the modification and/or<br>
development of pesticidal compounds and are especially substituents that maintain or enhance the herbicidal activity associated with the compounds of the present invention, or influence persistence of action, soil or plant penetration, or any other desirable property of such herbicidal compounds. There may be one or more of the same or different substituents present in each part of the molecules. In relation to moieties defined above as comprising an optionally substituted alkyl group, including alkyl parts of haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and dialkylamino groups, specific examples of such substituents include phenyl, halogen atoms, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl, C1-4-alkoxy, C1-4-haloalkoxy and C1-4-alkoxycarbonyl groups.<br>
In relation to moieties defined above as comprising an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group, optional substituents include halogen, especially fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms, and nitro, cyano, amino, hydroxyl, C1-4-alkyl, C1-4-alkoxy, C1-4-haloalkyl, C1-4-haloalkoxy, and halosulfanyl groups such as SF5. 1 to 5 substituents may suitably be employed, 1 to 2 substituents being preferred. Typically haloalkyl, haloalkoxy and haloalkylthio groups are trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy and trifluoromethylthio groups.<br>
The index m preferably means an integer from 1 to 3, n is preferably 1 (then R1 is not hydrogen).<br>
The compounds according to general formula I are oils, gums, or, predominantly, crystalline solid materials. They can be used in agriculture or related fields for the control of undesired plants such as Alopecurus myosuroides, Echinochloa crus-galli, Setaria viridis, Galium aparine, Stellaria media, Veronica persica, Lamium purpureum, Viola arvensis, Abutilon theophrasti, Ipomoea pur-purea and Amaranthus retroflexus by pre- and post-emergence application. The compounds of general formula I according to the invention possess a high herbicidal activity within a wide concentration range and may be used in agriculture.<br>
Preferred compounds are those wherein A represents a phenyl, pyridyl, or pyrazolyl group, being substituted by one or more identical or different substituents selected from halogen atoms, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy and pentahalosulfanyl groups.<br>
Especially preferred are compounds bearing a substituent in group A in meta-position relative to the point of attachment of this group.<br>
Good results in terms of control of undesired plant growth are obtained when A is mete-substituted by a chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group, especially A being a 2-chloropyrid-4-yl, 1-methyl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-5-yl or 3-trifluoromethylphenyl group.<br>
Particularly good results in control of weeds are achieved with compounds wherein X represents an oxygen atom. Especially good results are obtained with compounds wherein Z represents a nitrogen atom.<br>
The following formula I A represents a preferred embodiment of the invention:<br>
In this formula A represents 3-trifluoromethylphenyl, 2-chloropyrid-4-yl, 2-trifluoromethylpyrid-4-yl, 2-difluoromethoxypyrid-4-yl or 1-methyl-3-trifluoromethylpyrazol-5-yl, R1 has the meaning given above; R2 , R2 and R2 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom, one or two of them also a trifluoromethyl, trifluormethoxy or a cyano group, R2" can further be a C1-C4-alkyl group, particularly tert-butyl.<br>

Compounds of formula XIII may subsequently be converted into compounds of formula III, essentially as described in Davies and Pigott, J. Chem. Soc, 1945, 347, by reaction with a phosphoryl halogenide or thionyl halogenide or phosgene, preferably phosphoryl chloride, phosphoryl bromide, ideally in the absence of a solvent, at elevated temperatures to obtain compounds of formula III.<br>
Compounds of formula III in the meaning above with R1=F may be obtained from compound III when R1 is chlorine or amino according to procedures known in the art, like described in Tullock C.W. et al, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1960, 5197 or Kiburis J. Klister J. J.Chem.Soc.Chem.Com. 1969, 381<br>
Compounds of general formula IV are known or may be prepared by known methods. They may be prepared and isolated separately or may be prepared in situ. Generally, a compound of general formula XIV<br>
A—XH (XIV)<br>
wherein A and X are as hereinbefore defined is reacted with a suitable metal base, for example a metal carbonate or hydride. Preferably the metal salt is a sodium or potassium salt.<br>
Compounds of general formula l may, if desired, be isolated and purified using conventional techniques.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a compound of general formula l as a herbicide. Further, in accordance with the invention there is provided a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus by treating the locus with a composition according to the invention or a compound of formula I. As a useful action is by foliar spray application, the locus is most suitably the plants in_a_crop area, typical crops being cereals, maize, soya bean, sunflower or cotton. However, application may also be to the soil for those compounds having pre-emergence herbicidal action. The dosage of active ingredient used may, for example be in the range of from 0.01 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 1 kg/ha.<br>
The present invention also extends to a method of making a herbicidal composition of the invention which comprises blending a compound of formula I with at least one carrier.<br>
Preferably there are at least two carriers in a composition of the present invention, at least one of which is a surface-active agent.<br>
A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may be, as<br><br>
appropriate, a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a<br>
solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Preferably compositions according to the invention contain 0.5 to 95% by weight of active ingredient.<br>
Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicates such as diatomaceous earths; magnesium silicates, for example talcs; magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites; aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas; calcium carbonate; calcium sulphate; ammonium sulphate; synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates; elements, for example carbon and sulphur; natural and synthetic resins, for example coumaron resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers; solid polychlorophenols; bitumen; waxes; solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates.<br>
Suitable liquid carriers include water; alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols; ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers; aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene; petroleum fractions, for example kerosene and light mineral oils; chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable.<br>
Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface-active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example, the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface-active agent.<br>
A surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent; it may be non-ionic or ionic, examples of suitable surface-active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids; the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose or pentaerythrol; condensates of these with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p-octylphenol or p-octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products; alkali or earth alkali metal salts, preferably sodium salts, or sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as dodecylbenzene sulphonate; and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.<br>
The herbicidal composition of the invention may also contain other active ingredients, for example, compounds possessing insecticidal or fungicidal properties, or other herbicides.<br>
A formulation containing a compound according to the invention can consist of 100 g of active ingredient (compound of formula I), 30 g of disperging agent, 3 g of antifoaming agent, 2 g of structure agent, 50 g of anti-freezing agent, 0.5 g of a biocidal agent and water ad 1000 ml. Prior to use it is diluted with water to give the desired concentration of active ingredient<br>
