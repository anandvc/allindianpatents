these circumstances it is clearly impossible to initiate the diversion from the handset.<br>
Moreover, if the handset is one of several associated with the cordless base station, diversion to the cellular number of calls intended for the fixed exchange line would prevent the other handsets receiving incoming calls.<br>
According to the invention there is provides a cordless telephone base station comprising means for connection to an exchange connection of a tele-communications network; wireless communication means for establishing wireless communication with one or more handsets to enable telephone communication between the handsets and the telecommunications network; paging means for transmitting a wireless paging signal to the or each handset; and handset detection means for detecting a response, transmitted by the handset, to such a paging signal; characterized in that the base station has call handling means for generating call diversion instructions and means for transmitting said call diversion instructions over the exchange connection to cause the network to direct incoming calls to the said exchange connection or to a second connection according to the presence or absence of the handsets as detected by the paging signal responses, and in that the second connection is specified in the call diversion instructions generated by the call handling means.<br><br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of controlling the routing of calls directed over a telecommunications network to a cordless telephone base station connected thereto and arranged for wireless .communication with one or more cordless handsets, wherein the base station transmits paging signals to one or more of said handsets, detects the presence or absence of responses to said paging signals, generates call diversion instructions, and transmits said call diversion instructions over the exchange connection to cause the network to direct incoming calls to the said exchange connection or to a predetermined other connection, specified in the instructions, according to the detected presence or absence of said paging signals.<br>
The invention makes use of the fact that although the handset is not in communication with the fixed exchange line when it goes out of range of the base station, the base station itself is still connected to the network. In normal cordless telephone systems, a base station and handset exchange coded paging signals when a call is initiated by either of them, in order to ensure that the handset is<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
