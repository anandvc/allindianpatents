BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-pole circuit breaker, and more<br>
particularly, to a multi-pole circuit breaker, which can ensure the equilibrium of<br>
contact forces between contactors in a single pole breaking unit relatively far from<br>
a switching mechanism and the reliability of a switching operation between the<br>
contactors.<br>
2.	Description of the Conventional Art<br>
In general, a circuit breaker is an electrical device that protects a load and<br>
a line by manually or automatically breaking the line in the event of an abnormal<br>
condition such as an overload and short-circuiting of the line.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a conventional multi-pole circuit<br>
breaker. FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a conventional multi-<br>
pole circuit breaker. FIG. 3 is a side view illustrating a conventional multi-pole<br>
circuit breaker. FIG. 4 is a perspective view showing the deformation of a driving<br>
shaft in a conventional multi-pole circuit breaker.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 4, the conventional multi-pole circuit breaker 1<br>
includes four single pole breaking units 10a, 10b, 10c, and 10d, that is, a single<br>
pole breaking unit 10a of R phase, a single pole breaking unit 10b of S phase, a<br>
single pole breaking unit 10c of T phase, and a single pole breaking unit 10d of N<br>
phase.<br><br>
Each of the single pole breaking units includes a case 20 having a space,<br>
fixed contactors 41 installed in the case 20 with a predetermined distance, a<br>
movable contactor 42 rotatably disposed between the fixed contactors 41 by<br>
shafts 53, a trip mechanism (not shown) for tripping the circuit breaker by<br>
detecting a large current flowing through the circuit, a switching mechanism 50<br>
automatically operated by the trip mechanism or manually operated by operating<br>
a handle 51, for separating the movable contactor 42 from the fixed contactors 41<br>
thereby cutting off a circuit, and an arc extinguishing mechanism 60 for<br>
extinguishing arc gas of a high temperature and a high pressure generated<br>
between movable contactor 42 and the fixed contacts 41 at the time of switching a<br>
circuit.<br>
The switching mechanism 50 includes a handle 51, an upper link (not<br>
shown) coupled to the trip mechanism, a lower link (not shown) coupled in<br>
conjunction with the lower part of the upper link, and driving shafts 52 for<br>
commonly connecting the lower link and the shaft 53 of each single pole breaking<br>
unit so that the shaft 53 of each single pole breaking unit can rotate in conjunction<br>
with the lower link.<br>
In the thus-constructed conventional multi-pole circuit breaker, when a<br>
normal current flows on a circuit, the movable contactor 42 is in contact with fixed<br>
contactors 41 thereby to maintain a closed circuit state.<br>
On the other hand, when a large current flows on the circuit abnormally<br>
while a circuit is in an ON state, the circuit breaker is tripped. At this time, the<br>
upper link and the lower link are rotated. As the lower link is rotated, the shaft 53<br>
coupled thereto through the driving shaft 52 rotates in a clockwise direction. At<br>
this time, the movable contactor 42 is separated from the fixed contactors 41 to<br><br>
thereby maintain an opened circuit state.<br>
However, in the conventional multi-pole circuit breaker, the switching<br>
mechanism 50 is not installed at the middle of the circuit breaker but installed<br>
biased to one side, that is to say, at the single pole breaking unit 10b of S phase<br>
corresponding to the second right one, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, of the four<br>
single pole breaking units 10a, 10b, 10c, and 10d to thereby make unbalanced<br>
the force applied to each of the single pole breaking units 10a, 10b, 10c, and 10d<br>
by the switching mechanism 50.<br>
Subsequently, there occurs a problem that, as shown in FIG. 4, end<br>
portions of the driving shafts 52 are deformed as they are bent in a clockwise<br>
direction. Hence, the shaft installed at the single pole breaking unit 10d of N<br>
phase has a smaller amount of rotation as compared to the shafts installed at the<br>
other single pole breaking units 10a, 10b, and 10c, and as a result, the contact<br>
and separation performance between the fixed contactors 41 and the movable<br>
contactor 42 and the reliability of the product are deteriorated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in an effort to solve the<br>
above-described problems, and has for its object to provide a multi-pole circuit<br>
breaker, which can ensure the equilibrium of contact forces between contactors in<br>
a single pole breaking unit relatively far from a switching mechanism and the<br>
reliability of a switching operation between the contactors.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a multi-pole circuit breaker in accordance<br>
with the present invention, which includes: a plurality of single pole breaking units<br><br>
having a pair of fixed contactors, a movable contactor rotatable to a contacted<br>
position to fixed contactors or a separated position from the fixed contactors, and<br>
shafts for rotatably supporting the movable contactor; a switching mechanism<br>
disposed on one of the plurality of single pole breaking units in order to provide a<br>
rotation force to the shafts; and a pair of driving shafts commonly connected to<br>
the shafts in order to simultaneously transmit a rotation force from the switching<br>
mechanism to the shafts of the plurality of single pole breaking units, including: a<br>
substrate disposed between the single pole breaking unit, spaced relatively far<br>
from the switching mechanism as compared to the other single pole breaking<br>
units among the plurality of single breaking units, and the adjacent single pole<br>
breaking unit; a link mechanism rotatably supported on the substrate, for providing<br>
a compensating rotation moment to the driving shafts so that a contact force<br>
between the contactors in the single pole breaking unit relatively far from the<br>
switching mechanism may not be smaller than a contact force between the<br>
contactors in the other single pole breaking units; and springs having one ends<br>
supported by the substrate and the other ends supported by the link mechanism,<br>
for providing an elastic force to the link mechanism for the provision of the<br>
compensating rotation moment.<br>

As illustrated therein, the multi-pole circuit breaker in accordance with the<br>
present invention is a circuit breaker for four poles (so-called four phases), and<br>
includes a circuit breaker body 110 consisting of four phase-based single pole<br>
breaking units 110a to 110d of R phase (so-called R pole), S phase (so-called S<br><br>
pole), T phase (so-called S pole), and N phase (so-called N pole), i.e., a R-phase<br>
single pole circuit breaking unit 110a, a S-phase single pole breaking unit 110b, a<br>
T-phase single pole breaking unit 110c, and an N-phase single pole breaking unit<br>
110d from top down.<br>
A switching mechanism 150 is disposed on the S-phase single pole<br>
breaking unit 110b. A handle 151 for manually switching the position of the<br>
switching mechanism, i.e., from an ON position to OFF position or from the OFF<br>
position to the ON position, is disposed on the top portion of the switching<br>
mechanism 150, being connected to the switching mechanism 150.<br>
A pair of driving shafts 152 is connected to shafts (53 of FIG. 2) in the<br>
single pole breaking units 110a to 110d of the respective phases in order to<br>
simultaneously transmit a driving force of the switching mechanism 150 to the<br>
single pole breaking units 110a to 110d of the respective phases.<br>
Between the T-phase single pole breaking unit 110c and the N-phase<br>
single pole breaking unit 110d, according to the present invention, an auxiliary<br>
mechanism 170 is disposed, which is disposed between the N-phase single pole<br>
breaking unit 110d, relatively far from the switching mechanism 150, and the<br>
adjacent T-phase single pole breaking unit 110c, and provides a compensating<br>
rotation moment to the driving shafts 152.<br>
Unexplained reference numeral 120 is a case made of an electrical<br>
insulating material of each of the single pole breaking units 110a to 110d.<br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the auxiliary mechanism 170 is disposed<br>
between the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d, relatively far from the<br>
switching mechanism 150 among the plurality of single breaking units 110a to<br>
110d, and the adjacent T-phase single pole breaking unit 110c.<br><br>
As illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9, the auxiliary mechanism 170 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention includes a substrate<br>
170 disposed between the N-phase single pole breaking unit, relatively far from<br>
the switching mechanism 150 as compared to the other single pole breaking units<br>
among the plurality of single breaking units 110a to 110d, and the adjacent T-<br>
phase single pole breaking unit 110c.<br>
A pair of opening 171a is prepared at the left and right sides, respectively,<br>
of the substrate 171 in order to permit the passage and rotation of the pair of<br>
driving shafts 152 and the rotation of a link mechanism 172, 173, 175, 176a,<br>
176b, and 176c (refer to FIG. 5). Rotation axis holes 171b for supporting a pair of<br>
hinge pins 176a rotatably supporting two sets of a pair of coupling links 172 to be<br>
described later are prepared at the top and bottom, respectively, of a central<br>
cylindrical portion of the substrate 171 that divides the pair of openings 171a into<br>
left and right parts.<br>
The link mechanism 172, 173, 175, 176a, 176b, and 176c to be included<br>
in the auxiliary mechanism 170 is rotatably supported on the substrate 171, and<br>
provides a compensating rotation moment to the driving shafts (152 of FIG. 5) so<br>
that a contact force between the movable contactor (42 of FIG. 2) and the fixed<br>
contactors (41 of FIG. 2) in the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d, relatively<br>
far from the switching mechanism 150, may not be smaller than a contact force<br>
between the movable contactor and the fixed contactors in the other single pole<br>
breaking units 110a to 110c.<br>
Springs 174 to be included in the auxiliary mechanism 170 have one ends<br>
supported by the substrate 171 and the other ends supported by a supporting link<br>
173, which is to be described hereinafter in more detail, among the link<br><br>
mechanism 172, 173, 175, 176a, 176b, and 176c, for providing an elastic force for<br>
the provision of the compensating rotation moment.<br>
The link mechanism in accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention includes: coupling links 172 provided with guide slots 172a for relatively<br>
movably receiving the driving shafts 152, and relatively rotatably coupled to the<br>
substrate 171 so as to have an axial line along the thickness direction thereof, for<br>
providing a compensating rotation moment to the driving shafts 152; and a<br>
supporting link 173 having one ends relatively rotatably coupled to the coupling<br>
links 172 and the other ends relatively rotatably supported by the substrate, for<br>
providing an elastic force from the springs 174 for rotation to the coupling links<br>
172.<br>
The link mechanism further includes supporting members 175 for<br>
supporting the other end of the supporting link 173 so as to be rotatable relative to<br>
the substrate 171 while supporting the other ends of the springs 174.<br>
The coupling links 172 are prepared in two sets of upper and lower<br>
coupling links corresponding to the pair of driving shafts 152. Each set of the<br>
coupling links 172 consists of a pair of coupling links 172. The coupling links 172<br>
have central axis holes, respectively, at a longitudinal center portion, the guide<br>
slots 172a are prepared at one ends around the central axis holes, and<br>
connecting axial holes for connecting to the supporting links 173 are prepared at<br>
opposite ends thereof. Therefore, one set of the pair of connection links 172 is<br>
supported so as to be only rotatable by the hinge pins 176a inserted through the<br>
central axis holes with the substrate 171 disposed therebetween.<br>
The supporting links are arrow-shaped members, whose head portions<br>
having a larger width than the other portions are provided with connection holes<br><br>
for connecting to the coupling links 172 and connected to the coupling links 172<br>
by connection axes 176b, whose body portions have the springs 174 disposed<br>
thereon, and whose leg portions are inserted into supporting holes prepared at the<br>
front side of the supporting members 175 and supported by the supporting<br>
members 175 so as to be movable back and forth along the longitudinal direction.<br>
One ends of the springs 174 are supported by the supporting members<br>
175, and the other ends thereof are supported by the head portions.<br>
The supporting members 175 are U-shaped members, and from a<br>
longitudinal standpoint, have the supporting holes at the front side and rotation<br>
axis holes for inserting hinge axes 176c therein, so the hinge axes 176c<br>
supported on the corners of the left and right openings 171a of the substrate 171<br>
are inserted into the rotation axis holes and made rotatable around the hinge axes<br>
176c. The other ends of the springs 174 provide an elastic bias force to the head<br>
portion of the supporting links 173 so that the supporting links 173 may move<br>
forward along the longitudinal direction. The head portions of the supporting links<br>
173 are connected to the connection links 172 by the connection axes 176b, and<br>
the coupling links 172 are supported by the hinge axes 176c so as to be only<br>
rotatable relative to the substrate 171, thus a linear force by which the supporting<br>
links 175 are to move forward along the longitudinal direction by the springs 174<br>
acts as a rotation driving force of the coupling links 172, thereby rotating the<br>
coupling links 172. As a result, an elastic bias force of the springs 174 acts as a<br>
compensating rotation moment of the driving shafts 152 held in a manner to pass<br>
through the guide slots 172a of the coupling links 172.<br>
In the meantime, the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d is a single<br>
pole breaking unit that serves to switch a grounding system. If the N-phase single<br><br>
pole breaking unit 110d is switched to an ON state according to the international<br>
standards for electrical safety, contacts of the movable contactors and fixed<br>
contactors therein have to be contacted with each other prior to those in the other<br>
three-phase (R phase, S phase, and T phase) single pole breaking units 110a,<br>
110b, 110c, and 110d. On the contrary, if the N-phase single pole breaking unit<br>
110d is switched to a trip (or OFF) state, the movable contactor and fixed<br>
contactors therein need to be separated from each other later than those in the<br>
other three-phase (R phase, S phase, and T phase) single pole breaking units<br>
110a, 110b, 110c, and 110d.<br>
In a case where the switching mechanism 150 of the circuit breaker is<br>
switched from the ON state to the trip or OFF state, a critical rotation point of the<br>
coupling links 172 is set in such a manner that the intervals rotated by the elastic<br>
bias force of the springs 174 of the auxiliary mechanism 170 for providing a<br>
compensating rotation moment to the driving shafts 152 are relatively longer than<br>
the intervals rotated by a pressure received from the driving shafts 152 as the<br>
driving shafts 152 are moved by the rotation driving of the switching mechanism<br>
150.<br>
That is, when switching between the contacts of the movable contactor<br>
and fixed contactors in the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d is carried out,<br>
the time point of switching the driving force from the switching mechanism 150 to<br>
the auxiliary mechanism 170 can be adjusted by the critical rotation points of the<br>
coupling links 172. Thus, the critical rotation points of the coupling links 172 can<br>
be adjusted by changing the shape of the coupling links 172 and the position of<br>
the rotation central axes, i.e., the hinge axes 176a, or the shape of the guide slots<br>
172a and the position of the point of inflection of the guide slots 182a.<br><br>
The operation of the thus-constructed multi-pole circuit breaker kin<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
below.<br>
When the circuit breaker enters into the trip (or OFF) state as shown in<br>
FIG. 10 from the ON state as shown in FIG. 10 due to the generation of an over<br>
current or shot-circuit current, the driving shafts 152 coupled to the switching<br>
mechanism 150 are rotated in a clockwise direction along with the rotation driving<br>
of the switching mechanism 150, and at the same time, each of the coupling links<br>
172 of the auxiliary mechanism 170 is rotated in a clockwise direction in conjunction with the driving shafts 152.<br>
As each of the coupling links 172 is rotated, each of the springs 174 of the<br>
auxiliary mechanism 170 applies an elastic force to the coupling links 172 in the<br>
counterclockwise direction for maintaining the ON state. Then, after each of the<br>
coupling links 172 is rotated to a predetermined position corresponding to the<br>
critical rotation points, the direction of the elastic force applied to the coupling links<br>
172 by the springs 174 are reversed to the clockwise direction, thereby<br>
implementing the rotation of the coupling links 172 subsequent to the critical<br>
rotation points by the elastic force from the springs 174.<br>
The regions of the driving shafts 152 to which the coupling links 172 are<br>
connected are rotated by the compensating rotation moment from the coupling<br>
links 172 elastically rotated by the springs 174, and make it possible to correct the<br>
unbalance of the rotation driving force of the driving shafts 152 caused by the<br>
switching mechanism 150 of the four pole circuit breaker being biased from the<br>
center of the circuit breaker body 110. At this point, the shafts (refer to 52 of FIG.<br>
2) of the single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, 110c, and 110d connected to the<br><br>
driving shafts 152 are rotated in a clockwise direction, and the movable contactor<br>
(refer to 42 of FIG. 2) is spaced apart from the fixed contactors (refer to 41 of FIG.<br>
2), thereby separating the contacts.<br>
Meanwhile, when the circuit breaker is manipulated from the trip (or OFF)<br>
state as shown in FIG. 11 to the ON state as shown in FIG. 10 by the user's<br>
manipulation of the handle, the driving shafts 152 coupled to the switching<br>
mechanism 150 are rotated in an counterclockwise direction along with the<br>
rotation driving of the switching mechanism 150, and at the same time, the<br>
coupling links 172 of the auxiliary mechanism 170 are rotated in the<br>
counterclockwise direction in conjunction with the driving shafts 152.<br>
As each of the coupling links 172 is rotated in the counterclockwise<br>
direction, each of the springs 174 of the auxiliary mechanism 170 applies an<br>
elastic force to the coupling links 172 in the clockwise direction for maintaining the<br>
OFF or trip state. Then, after each of the coupling links 172 is rotated to a<br>
predetermined position corresponding to the critical rotation points, the direction of<br>
the elastic force applied to the coupling links 172 by the springs 174 are reversed<br>
to the counterclockwise direction, thereby implementing the rotation of the<br>
coupling links 172 subsequent to the critical rotation points by the elastic force<br>
from the springs 174.<br>
The regions of the driving shafts 152 to which the coupling links 172 are<br>
connected are rotated by the compensating rotation moment from the coupling<br>
links 172 elastically rotated by the springs 174, and make it possible to correct the<br>
unbalance of the rotation driving force of the driving shafts 152 caused by the<br>
switching mechanism 150 of the four pole circuit breaker being biased from the<br>
center of the circuit breaker body 110. At this point, the shafts (refer to 52 of FIG.<br><br>
2) of the single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, 110c, and 110d connected to the<br>
driving shafts 152 are rotated in a counterclockwise direction, and the movable<br>
contactor (refer to 42 of FIG. 2) is contacted with the fixed contactors (refer to 41<br>
of FIG. 2), thereby closing the contacts.<br>
As above, in the multi-pole circuit breaker in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, by compensating for the rotation driving<br>
force, applied to the single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, 110c, and 110cd from<br>
the switching mechanism 150, in terms of balance by means of the auxiliary<br>
mechanism 170, the regions of the driving shafts 142 corresponding to the N-<br>
phase single pole breaking unit 110d relatively farthest away from the switching<br>
mechanism 150 can be prevented from deformation, and the amount of rotation of<br>
the shafts (53 of FIG. 2) disposed at the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d<br>
can be made almost the same as those of the shafts (53 of FIG. 2) of the other<br>
three-phase (R, S, and T phases) single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, and<br>
110c. This enables the contactors (41 and 42 of FIG. 2) of the N-phase single<br>
pole breaking unit 110d to be contacted with each other with a sufficient contact<br>
force, and thus prevents heat generation caused by degraded reliability and<br>
incomplete contact.<br>
Moreover, the critical rotation points of the coupling links 172 at which the<br>
rotation driving force of the coupling links 172 is switched from the switching<br>
mechanism 150 to the auxiliary mechanism 170 are set in such a manner that if<br>
the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d serving as a grounding system is<br>
switched to the ON state, the contacts thereof are coupled prior to those of the<br>
other three-phase (R, S, and T phases) single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, and<br>
110c, and in contrast, if the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d serving as a<br><br>
grounding system is switched to the trip (or OFF state), the contacts thereof are<br>
separated from each other later than those of the other three phase (R, S, and T<br>
phases) single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, and 110c. By this construction, the<br>
ground is connected (input) first at the time of power input, and the ground is<br>
disconnected (cut off) last at the time of tripping, thereby improving safety and<br>
reliability.<br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 are a perspective view and front view, respectively,<br>
showing an auxiliary mechanism in accordance with another embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, the multi-pole circuit breaker in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention will be described below. Like<br>
reference numerals are given to constituent components like to those described in<br>
the aforesaid one embodiment of the present invention, and a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
The multi-pole circuit breaker in accordance with another embodiment of<br>
the present invention includes an auxiliary mechanism 270 that is operated in<br>
conjunction with the operation the above-described switching mechanism 150,<br>
and provides a compensating rotation moment to the driving shafts 152.<br>
The auxiliary mechanism 270 includes a pair of substrates 271 fixedly<br>
disposed between the N-phase single pole breaking unit 110d and the T-phase<br>
single pole breaking unit 110c, and spaced apart a predetermined gap along the<br>
thickness direction by having through portions 271a penetrated along the<br>
thickness direction into a predetermined shape so as to pass the driving shafts<br>
152 through, coupling links 272 relatively rotatably coupled to the substrates 271<br>
so as to have an axial line along the thickness direction by having guide slots<br><br>
272a for relatively rotating the driving shafts 152 and slidably receiving them, and<br>
springs 274 disposed between the coupling links 272 and the substrates 271 for<br>
providing an elastic force to the coupling links 272.<br>
At this time, the substrates 271 and the coupling links 272 are relatively<br>
rotatably coupled to each other via typical hinge pins 276a.<br>
Spring receiving portions 271b for receiving and supporting one ends of<br>
the springs 274 are formed at the substrates 271, respectively. Spring supporting<br>
portions 273 are protruded from the coupling links 272 so as to connect and<br>
support the other ends of the springs 274. The spring receiving portions 271b<br>
may be comprised of depressed portions formed at a width almost equal to the<br>
diameter of the springs 274, or spring seats additionally having projections<br>
protruded from the depressed portions in order to prevent the springs 274 from<br>
falling out.<br>
Further, if the circuit breaker is switched from the ON state to the OFF<br>
state, the critical rotation points of the coupling links 272 are set in such a manner<br>
that the intervals rotated by the elastic force of the springs 274 are relatively<br>
longer than the intervals pressurized and rotated by the driving shafts 172.<br>
By the above construction, the rotation driving force applied from the<br>
switching mechanism 150 to the single pole breaking units 110a, 110b, 110c, and<br>
110d by the auxiliary mechanism 150 in accordance with another embodiment of<br>
the present invention can be applied in balance, and the single pole breaking unit<br>
for a neutral electrode serving as a ground system is input first at the time of<br>
power input, and the single pole breaking unit for a neutral electrode serving as a<br>
ground system is disconnected (cut off) last at the time of tripping.<br>
As seen from above, according to the multi-pole circuit breaker in<br><br>
accordance with the present invention, it is possible to ensure the reliability of the<br>
switching operation between the contactors in the single pole breaking unit<br>
relatively far from the switching mechanism in the multi-pole circuit breaker, and<br>
the contact force between the contactors in the single pole breaking unit for each<br>
phase when applying current is balanced, thereby overcoming the problem of heat<br>
generation caused by incomplete contact between the contactors.<br><br><br>
