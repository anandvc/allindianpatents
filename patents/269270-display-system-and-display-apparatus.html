				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DISPLAY SYSTEM AND DISPLAY APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field [0001]   <br>
The present invention relates to a display system, and a display apparatus, more specifically, to a display system including a display apparatus capable of being con»«cted to an output apparatus (external device) such as a DVD recording apparatus through a digital interface such as an HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) and a display apparatus constituting the system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] .<br>
HDMIs have come into wide use as a digital interface for transmission of video/audio. The HDMI is arranged for AV devices by adding an audio transmission function and a copyright protection function to DVI which is a connection standard for a PC and a display.<br>
Conventionally, a plurality of cables for each signal of video/audio/control have been used for the connection.,between devices , however, sin-ce the HDMI needs only one cable and control signals correspond to bidirectidtial transmission, it has also been possible to operate the entire AV system such as a home theater with one remote controller by relaying the control signal to an output apparatus such as an STB (Set Top Box) and a DVD player connected by the HDMI from a monitor.-<br><br>
[0003]<br>
The basic specification for the standard of the HDMI was established in,,pecerti,ber 2002 by the standardization organization of HDMI Licensing, LLC  (HDMI standard<br>
Verl.0) ,and:	a rule for CEC  (Consumer Electronics<br>
Control) was added as a control protocol for performing control between A'V devices in December 2005 (HDMI standard Verl.2a, refer to Non-Patent Literature 1). After that, although some revisions have been made, description of the CEC will hereinafter be based on the standard after the HDMI standard Verl.2a and be referred to as the HDMI standard unless otherwise noted. [0004]<br>
Note that, terms about the CEC are defined in *2.2 Glossary of Terms" of the HDMI standard, "CEC 2 . 2 Glossary of Terms" and the like, where one that has an HDMI input terminal is defined as a sink device, one that has an. HDMI output terminal and outputs an AV stream is defined as a source device , and one that has an HDMI input terminal and output terminal and inputs/outputs an AV stream is defined as a repeater device. [0005]<br>
In the HDMI standard, control between devices using the CEC is defined'. According to thepEC, various kinds of control are possible based on individual physical addresses and logical addresses assigned to each device existing on an HDMI network. For example, when reproduction of video is made by depressing a reproduction button, or the like, of a DVD player connected by HDMI while a user views digital, broadcast<br><br>
on a television, the television automatically switches to an input connected with the DVD player.  Moreover, operation menu displayed on the DVD player, ,on/off of a power source and the like is able to be operated from a remote controller of the television.<br>
[0 006]         <br>
In addition, the HDMI standard' prescribes that operation is able to be made even when a maximum of 10 devices including a television are connected, thus it is possible to connect up to nine external devices to a television. When one device compatible with HDMI CEC is connected to the television, it is clear which device is operated from a remote controller, however, when a plurality of devices compatible with HDMI CEC are connected, there is a problem that it is hard to recognize which device is operated from the television using a remote controller of the television. [0007]<br>
Hence, it is considered that, when operating of the device compatible with HDMI CEC from the television using the remote controller of the television as described above, by selecting a device actually displaying video on the television as a device targeted for the operation, the operation-'otoject device is limited from-.a plurality of devices.  In the HDMI standard, as a CEC message for clearly indicati'ng such a device displaying video on the television, <active source> is prescribed. • According to this prescription, for example, in a case where a user operates a reproduction button of a DVD player compliant with HDMI CEC, when the DVD player itself is in a state<br><br>
capable of outputting stable video signal (that is, in an active state), the DVD player outputs an AV stream as.veii** broadcasts <active source> indicative of,lpeing an active d«vtce. Here, the 'broadcast"' means simultaneou-s transjnission of signal whose transmission destination is not aspecific device but all devices. The television and other devices compatible with-HDMI CEC to which <ctive source> has been broadcasted switch a route for reproducing the AV stream output from the DVD player. In this way, it is prescribed that in devices compatible with HDMI CEC a device displaying video on TV broadcasts <active source> to other devices in a<br>
network.<br>
Note that, although an example in a case of operating a reproduction button of a DVD player has been described above, it is similar in the next case. For example, in a case where <request active source> has been broadcasted by other device compatible with HDMI CEC due to a user operation, and when a DVD player is an "active device", the DVD player broadcasts <active source> indicative of itself being an active device. Here, the <request active source> is one of CEC messages defined in the HDMI standard and used for a purpose to inquire about an active device in a route.<br>
[000 8]<br>
However, a methd'd in which an "active device" which has broadcasted <active source> becomes as an operation object device has the following problem. To correspond to the CEC itself is optional in the HDMI standard, however, essentially corresponded prescriptions and<br><br>
selectively corresponded prescriptions are mixed in various prescriptions of the CEC, thus posing the following disadvantage.     <br>
Assumed is a state where a television includes a plurality of. HDMI input, termirnals, and for example, a device A and a device B that are devices compatib-le with HDMI CEC are connected to each of the HDMI input terminals . First, it is assumed that a user operates a reproduction button of the device A intending to operate the device A connected to the television. In this case, since the device A is an operable device, the device A broadcasts <active source> as described above. That is, at this time, the television and other devices compatible with HDMI CEC having received this are notified that the device A is an 'active device". [0009]<br>
Next, it is assumed that the user performs input switching operation of the television intending to operate the device B and selects a connected input of the device B. However, there is a case where the device B does not broadcast <active source>, and in such-a case, the device A remains as an "active device". Thus, even when the user performs some operation to the device B, operation signal thereof is:transmitted to the. device A which is the 'active device". Such disadvantage is caused by that the device B 4oes not correspond to a selectively-corresponded prescription in the HDMI standard.<br>
Even after a user displays video to instruct switching to a device desired to be an operation object.<br><br>
when the switching destination device is not an 'active<br>
device", the television does not recognize the device<br>
as an' operation object device, .thus it is impossible to,,<br>
operate -the switching destination device  from the<br>
television..	. -<br>
 [0010]<br>
Contrary to this, even when a device is not an -"active device", there is a method that the television recognizes the device as an operation object device. This method is , regardless of presence/absence of <active source>, one in which a device specified by <set stream path> becomes as an operation object device. The <set stream path> is one of CEC messages defined in the HDMI standard, and when an input switching operation is made by a user, transmitted from a television to switch an input path by broadcast.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIO-N<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0011]<br>
Hbvever, the above-dascribed method in which th.e; device specified by <set stream path> becomes as an-operation-obj ect device hat's the following problem.<br>
For example, it is assumed that a television, a repeater device and a source device are connected in this order and the repeater device is a device non-compatible with CEC.  In a case where video output operation is made<br><br>
to the source device or <request active source> is broadcasted by other device compatible with HDMI CEC, the source device, when being an "active device" In itself, broadcasts <active source>. A - television having received <active source> broadcasts <set stream pat> to switch an input path to the source device. . At trhis time, since the repeater device which is a device non-compatible with CEC does not notify the television of a- physical address of a source device connected to the repeater device itself, the television is able-to recognize only up to the physical address of the repeater device. As a result, the television broadcasts <set stream path> that specifies the physical address of the repeater device. Thereby, in the case of making the device specified by <set stream path> become as an operation object device, the repeater device which is a device non-compatible with CEC is to be recognized as the operation object device. [0012]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and an object is to provide a display system capable of, in a case where a plurality of external devices are HDMI-connected .to .a dispray apparatus hierarchica'l'ly and a de"vlQe non-compatible with CEC is contained in an input path, selecting an external device that has transmitted <active source> as the operation object device without selecting an operation object device by <set stream path> and a display apparatus constituting the system.<br><br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0013]<br>
In order' to solve the above problem, a first technical means of the present invention is a display system wherein"a display apparatus and a plurality of external devices are HDMI-connected hierarchically in a tree shape, wherein the display apparatus is provided with a CEC interface which receives a first CEC message indicative of being in an active state capable of outputting video, from any of external device out of the plurality of external devices, and which transmits a second CEC message to switch an input path to the external device, and operation object device selection means for selecting, when a device non-compatible with CEC is contained in the input path for transmitting the second CEC message, an external device that corresponds to a physical address specified by the first CEC message as an operation object device.<br>
[0014]<br>
A second technical means is the display system as defined in the first technical means, wherein the operation object device selection means compares a first physical address contained inthe first CEC message received from the external device, with a second physical address contained in the second CEC i»essage transmitted from the display apparatus , and when an input path shown by the second physical addr««s is contained in an input path shown by the -first physical address, an external device that corresponds to a physical address specified<br><br>
by the first CEC message is selected as an operation<br>
obj ect device.<br>
[0015]<br>
A third technical means is the display system as defined in _the .first technical ..means, wherein the operation object device selection means selects an external device specified by the-second CEC message as an operation object device when a device non-compatible with CEC is not contained in the input path for transmitting the second CEC message. [0016]<br>
A fourth technical means is the display system as defined in any one of the first through the third technical means, wherein the first CEC message is <active source> defined in HDMI standard, and the second CEC message is <set stream path> defined in the HDMI standard. [0017]<br>

In addition, the system control portion 104 performs analysis of a CEC message transmitted/received through the HDMI terminals 108 and 109 and control of operations based on the analysis result. [0038]<br>
A main characteristic part of the present invention liep in that, in a case where*, a, plurality of e'Sttrnal devices are connected to the tel.evision apparatrus 100 through the HDMI terminals 108 and 109 hierarchidally in a tree shape and a device non-compatible with CEC is contained in an input path, selecting an external device that has transmitted <active source> as an operation object device is performed without selecting an operation<br><br>
object device by <set stream path> . As the structure for this, the television apparatus 100 includes the HDMI terminals tPEC I/F) 108 and 109 which receive <active source> corresponding to the first CEC message indicative of being in an active state and output from any external device out of a plurality--o-f external devices, and transmit <set stream path> corresponding to the second CEC message for switching an input path to the external device. The <active source> is transmitted from an external device that has become an "active device" as video output operation was made by a user, or an external device which has been an "active device" when <request active source> was broadcasted from other device compatible with HDMI CEC by a user opera-tion. [0039]<br>
Furthermore, the television apparatus 100 includes, when a device non-compatible with CEC is contained in an input path for transmitting <set stream path>, operation object device selection means 104a for selecting an external device specified by <active source> as an operation object device. The operation object device selection means 104a selects, when a CEC non-corresponding apparatus is not contained in the input path for transmitting <set- stream path>, an external device specified by <set stream path> as the operation object device. The function of the operation object device selection means 104a is executed by the system control portion 104.<br>
Description will be given for a method for selecting an operation object device by a display system of the<br><br>
present invention with reference to Figs. 3 and 4 below<br>
illustrating a specific example.<br>
[0040]<br>
Fig. 3 is a view illustrating an" example of a method for selecting an operation object device by the display system -of- the present invention. In this example, the television apparatus (hereinafter, TV) 100 as a sink device includes two HDMI inputs (input 1 and input 2), wherein one input 1 is connected to an AV amplifier 20a as a repeater device, and further the AV amplifier 20a-includes two HDMI inputs (input 3 and input 4), wherein the input 3 is connected to a recorder 10a as a source device and the input 4 is connected to a DVD player 10b as a source device. Additionally, the other input 2 is connected to a recorder 10c as a source device. Note that, numbers of (0.0.0.0), (1.0.0.0), ..., (2.0.0.0) assigned to each device are physical addresses showing connected positions of each device. [0041]<br>
Fig. 4 is a view showing an example of communication processing by CEC when input switching is performed by video output from a source device. Fig. 4 (A) shows an example of a case where the AV amplifier 20a as the repeafer /device is a device compati'brle with HDMI CEC," and Figv 4 (B) shows an example of a case where ttie AV amplifier 20a as the repeater device is a device non-compatible with CEC. Note that; description for the communication processing in Figs. 4 (A) and (B) will be given based on the connection example of Fig. 3, and a command transmission illustrated by a dotted line shows<br><br>
processing of transmitting from a transmission source by broadcast. [0042]<br>
In Fig. 4.(A) , when a reproduction button of a DVD player 10b at physical address (1.2.0.0) is pressed and reproduction of AV stream is started during the viewing video recorded ina recorder 10c on TV 100, the DVD player 10b transmits <active source> indicative of itself being an "active device" by broadcast (Sll) . On receipt of this, TV 100 transmits a CEC message <routing change> indicative of switching an input path to HDMI input (input 1) to which the AV amplifier 20a is connected, by broadcast (S12). Then, on receipt of this, the AV amplifier 20a transmits, as the DVD player 10b is connected thereto, a CEC message <routing information> to notify of an input path from the AV amplifier 20a to the DVD player 10b by broadcast (S13) . Finally, the TV 100 having received this transmits a CEC message <set stream path> to determine the input path to the DVD player 1-Ob by broadcast (S14) .<br>
At the physical address (1.2.0.0) specified by the finally transmitted <set stream path>, the DVD player 10b exists. Accordingly, an operation object device in this case is the'.DVD player 10b. Wo'tp that, in this case, the physical address (1.2.0.0) is' the second physical address.<br>
Hereinbefore, description has been . given illustrating a case where the reproduction button of the DVD player 10b was pressed, however, it is also similar in a case where <request active source> is broadcasted<br><br>
from other device compatible with HDMI CEC due to a user operation,  and a DVD player 10b broadcasts <active source> indicative of itself being an "active device". [0043]<br>
Here, bo.th the <routing change> and <routing information> ' a-re CEC messages defined in the HDMI standard. The <routing change> is for showing a change of the input path, and the <routing information> is for notifying of the input path on receipt of the <routing change>. - , [0044]<br>
According to the example of Fig. 4 (A) , in response to the video output operation for the source device, <active source> is transmitted from the source device. The TV on receipt of this transmits <set stream path> by broadcast specifying a physical address of the source device. As a result, the source device specified by <set stream path> may become as an operation object device. In this case, the AV amplifier 20a as the repeater device needs to be a device compatible with HDMI CEC. [0045]<br>
However, when the AV amplifier 20a is a device non-compatible with CEC, because of not reacting to <routing chamge:> broadcast-transmitted by-the TV 100, the CEC message <routing information> to notify of the input path from the AV amplifier 20a to the DVD player 10b is not transmitted. Thereby, <set stream path> finally transmitted by the TV 100 is to be <set stream path fl.0.0.0> which input path has been confirmed. Accordingly, the AV amplifier 20a is selected as an<br><br>
operation object, and the DVD player 10b is not able to become asan operation object.  Description for this will be given based on Fig. 4 (B) . [0046]<br>
In Fig. 4(B) , whe-n a reproduction button of a DVD player 10b at physical-address (1.2.0.0) -is pressed and reproduction of AV stream is started dyring the viewing video recorded in a recorder 10c on TV 100, the DVD player 10b transmits <active source> indicativeof itself being an "active device" by broadcast (S21) . On receipt of this, TV 100 transmits a CEC message <routing change> indicative of switching an input to HDMI input (input 1) to which an AV amplifier 20a is connected, by broadcast (S22). However, since the AV amplifier 20a is a device non-compatible with CEC that does not respond to a CEC message, a CEC message <routing information> to notify of a route from the AV amplifier 20a to the DVD player 10b is not transmitted. [0047]<br>
Then, the TV 100 which is not able to receive <routing information>, is unable to determine an input path from and after th.e AV amplifier 20a, and transmits a CEC message <set stream path> to determine a finally confirmed -i-nput path up to ""the AV amplifier 20a by broadcast (S23,h,,<br>
As a result, at a physical address specified by <set stream path> finally transmitted, the AV amplifier 20a exists, and the AV amplifier 20a that is a device non-compatible with CEC becomes an operation object device.<br><br>
[00 48']<br>
To improve such a problem, processing described below is executed in the present invention.<br>
The TV 100 recognizes that the 'active device" is the DVD player 10b at the time <active source> has: been transmitted (S2l) .' Therefore, the TV 100 updates , -at the time of receiving, the <active source>, an operation object device (that is, updates to the DVD player 10b) with the physical address  (first physical address) notified by the <active source>.  Furthermore, in route switching processing on receipt of <active source>, as long as the physical address (second physical address) specified by <set stream path> transmitted in the processing is a device non-compatible with CEC, an operation object device is not to be updated by the physical address (second physical address) of the device non-compatible with CEC.  Thereby, in the case of the example of Fig. 3, the AV amplifier 20a that does not correspond to CEC is not selected as an operation object, and the DVD player 10b specified by <active source> is selected as an operation object device. [0049]<br>
Note that, the above-described processing is executed only in a cse where the AV amplifier-.-.Oa is the., device non-compatible with CEC, and when tivje AV amplifier 20a is the-device compatible with HDMI;.CEC, as shown in Fig. 4 (A), an operation object device is updated by the physical address specified by the <set stream path>.<br>
Update processing of an operation object device<br><br>
when the AV amplifier 20a does not correspond to CEC, or corresponds to CEC, is executed by operation object device selection means 104a shown in Fig. 2. The operation object device selection means 104a is able to determine whether AV amplifier 20a is device compatible with HDMI CEC or non-corresponding device by presence/absence of a response to a CEC message <routing change>. [0050]<br>
Here, a physical address of the AV amplifier 20a is (1.0.0.0) and a physical address of the DVD player 10b is (1.2.0.0) , therefore it is understood that an input path up to the physical address (1.0.0.0) of the AV amplifier 20a is contained in an input path up to the physical address (1.2.0.0) of the DVD player 10b. Nonetheless, since there is no response to a CEC message from the AV amplifier 20a at the physical address (1.0.0.0), it is recognized that it is a device non-compatible with CEC. In the case of the device non-compatible with CEC, because of not responding to a CEC message, the physical address (1.0.0.0) of the AV amplifier 20a is not appropriate as a physical address of an operation object device. Thereby, an op'eration •Qbject device is not updat-ed by the physicafl- address -(1.0.0.0) of the AV amplifier,20a, and the DVD player -10b at the physical address,. (1.2.0.0) specified by <active source> that has already been received, becomes as an operation object device. Note that, in this case, the physical address (1.2.0.0) Is the first physical address.<br><br>
[0051]<br>
That is, the operation object device selection means 104a shown in Fig. 2 compares the first physical address ..(1.2.0.0) included in the <active source> received £f rom the DVD player 10b, with the second physical address - .11. 0 . 0 . 0) include-d in the <set stream path>-transmitted from the TV 1:D0-, and when an input path shown by the second physical address (1.0.0.0) is contained in an input path shown by the first physical address (1.2.0.0), the DVD player 10b specified by <active source> is selected as an operation object device. [0052]<br>
By performing the above-described processing, in a network structure to which a plurality of devices are HDMI-connected, even when a CEC non-corresponding repeater device exists between a sink device (TV) and a source device, the source device notifies TV of <active source> by performing video output operation to a source device and, thereby, the source device that has notified of the <active source> is able to become as an operation object.<br><br><br><br><br>
