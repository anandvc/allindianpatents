3.        PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water purification systems.<br>
Background of the Invention &amp; the Related Art<br>
The water purifiers are systems which incorporate devices either to block, absorb or separate the passage of contaminants and also to disinfect the microbial contaminants. These purification components or devices therefore become the storehouse of contaminants on repeated usage. The process of build up of contaminants on these devices also increases the risk of sudden unloading of contaminants in the purification stream. These contaminants when unloaded in higher limits will cross the purification system untreated.<br>
In a water purifier system the biggest threat is building up of a biofilm on the surfaces and depths of purifying devices due to abundance of organics and nutrients for these microorganisms.<br>
The biofilm or slime are highly resistant to most disinfection system therefore any accidental unloads of biofilm can contaminate the water.<br>
An uncontrolled biofilm or slime growth can also block the pores if filters, membranes and also make UV system ineffective.<br>
An uncontrolled slime growth on the filter elements also imparts an offensive odor to the treated water.<br><br><br>
Most often the purified water or the disinfected water from the purification system gets recontaminated due to any one or more of the following reasons:<br>
a)	The contaminants, biofilm, microorganisms residing on the downstream of the<br>
purifier.<br>
b)	The contamination due to the improper handling of water say, contaminated tumbler, contaminated finger tips etc.<br>
c)	The aerobic microorganisms residing in the water bottle could also enter the purified water and may impart the foul odor to the water.<br>
Most of the existing water purifiers in the market do not have means or device to prevent microbial growth on the filtering element and disinfecting element.<br>
The existing water purifiers also do not have post disinfection or a post purifier to prevent the recontamination of water arising from an outside environment (In other words do not provide residual protection).<br>
The existing water purifiers do not provided the backup or the standby purification in the event of failure or inefficiency of the main purifying device against the pathogenic microorganisms.<br>
Further, in the existing purifiers, the purifier elements are replaced from time to time to control the building up of the biofilm.<br>
4.        DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The objective of the invention titled Electrolytic Purification System (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water purification systems are to:<br>
a)  To keep the upstream components of the purifier sanitized and thereby preventing the growth of the biofilm or the slime at all the times.<br><br><br>
b)	To provide a standby or backup purification for the elimination of the pathogens in the event of failure of the main purifying device.<br>
c)	To prevent the recontamination of the purified water due to the external factors such as the biofilm formation in the downstream end contamination due to improper handling touch, i.e. to offer a good shelf life to the treated water.<br>
WORKING PRINCIPLE OF THE INVENTION-EPS<br>
The electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water purification systems comprises of an assembly of a set of noble metal electrodes in form of plates made up of silver or gold or any other noble metal. These electrodes are spaced in a flowthrough cell wherein the fluid or water to be treated flows between the cells. Each of these electrodes has a conducting wire welded to the surface. These wires emerge from the electrodes for DC voltage connection. The positive wire and its corresponding electrode are called as anode P and negative wire going to the respective electrode is called as cathode N.<br>
On activation of these electrodes with a specific DC voltage, the electrodes release nascent oxygen, free hydroxyl radicals and the traces of noble metal ions.<br>
The device herein stated releases noble metal in colloidal form or electrolytic form. The elements released such as nascent oxygen, free hydroxyl radicals and the traces of noble metal ions are the prime constituents for the sanitizing and disinfecting effect.<br>
The noble metal electrodes alongwith the flowthrough cell form a watertight or pressure tight compartment with a port for incoming water and another port for treated water. The electrical connections emerging from the electrode to the outside of the cell are also watertight.<br>
In hard water environment, the hardness elements like calcium and magnesium which are positively charged deposit on the negative electrode. The deposition of<br><br><br>
these hardness or the scaling elements will eventually result in the blocking of the current and the EPS process will cease to perform.<br>
To avoid such situation the waveform of the DC voltage is specifically altered to prevent the scale formation on the electrodes. This DC wave configuration and the geometry of the electrodes ensure a continuous disinfection performance without the formation of the scale on the electrodes in the hard water environment.<br>
Further this EPS device under consideration, along with electronic controller EC forms an EPS system. The function of the controller when used in a water purifier [in conjunction with either a particle filter or carbon filter or UV based purifier and specifically Reverse Osmosis (RO)based purifier system is to activate the electrodes with a nonscaling DC waveform on an intermittent basis to ensure the higher life of the electrodes. The controller also provides the DC voltage on the electrodes to release the sanitizing and the purification elements.<br>
In a typical water purifier, the EPS system under consideration, will comprise of an electronic controller and EPS cell EP1 and EP 2. EP1 is placed at the upstream inlet end of the purifier and EP2 if required, specifically for RO system; it is placed on product waterside of the RO system.<br>
EP1 and EP2 cells may be identical; in design based on the specific design requirements.<br>
Now the invention relating to Electrolytic Purification System (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water purification systems is more explained with the help the diagrams.<br>

The electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water, the said purification system has electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3). Within the said electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3) there is a set of noble metal electrodes in the form of plates consisting of two noble metal electrodes in the form of plates being plate E-1 (1) and plate E-2 (2). The said noble metal electrodes in the form of plates (1 &amp; 2) are made up of the noble metals like silver or gold. These electrode plates (1&amp; 2) are spaced in a flowthrough electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3) wherein the water to be treated flows between the electrodes plates E-1 (1) &amp; E-2 (2). Further, each of these electrode plates E-1 (1) &amp; E-2 (2) has a conducting wire being wire W-l (4) &amp; W-2 (5) welded to the surface of the electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3). These wires W-l (4) &amp; W-2 (5) emerge from the electrodes plates E-1 (1) &amp; E-2  (2)  for the  DC  voltage  connection.  In this  the positive wire  &amp;  its<br><br><br>
corresponding electrode is called as anode P (6) and the negative wire &amp; its corresponding electrode is called as cathode N (7).<br>
On activation with a specific DC voltage, the electrodes plates E-l (1) &amp; E-2 (2) release nascent oxygen, free hydroxyl radicals and traces of noble metal ions. The electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water noble metal on electrodes plates E-l (1) &amp; E-2 (2) release in colloidal from/electrolytic form. The elements released such as nascent oxygen, free hydroxyl radicals &amp; the traces of noble metal ions are the prime constituents for the sanitizing and disinfecting effect.<br>
On entry of the water to be treated through the entry port T (8), on activation with a specific DC voltage, the electrodes plates E-l (1) &amp; E-2 (2) in the electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3), release nascent oxygen, free hydroxyl radicals and traces of noble metal ions in colloidal from/electrolytic form. These elements so released are the prime constituents for the sanitizing and disinfecting effect. On completion of this treatment the water to duly treated in the electrolytic purification system (EPS) case (3) is released through the exit port 'O' (9). Thus, the electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water treating the water with the necessary sanitizing and disinfecting effect.<br>
The strong oxidizing power of Nascent oxygen and free hydroxyl radicals kill microorganisms and the noble metals such as silver, gold, platinum show oligodynamic action. The oligodynamic action is the ability of very small amounts of these noble metals to exert antimicrobial property .<br>
In the typical hard water environment, the hardening elements like calcium and magnesium which are positively charged, deposit on the negative electrode plate E-2 (2). The deposition of these hardness or scaling elements will eventually result in the blocking of the current and the EPS process will cease to perform. To avoid such a situation the waveform of the DC voltage is specifically altered to prevent the scale formation on electrodes plates E-l (1) &amp; E-2 (2). This DC wave<br><br><br>
configuration and the geometry of the electrodes ensure a continuous disinfection performance without the formation of scale on the electrodes plates E-l (1) &amp; E-2 (2) in the hard water environment.<br>
The electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water, the said purification system is along with electronic controller (10).<br>
The function of the controller &amp; the electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water treating the water may be used in any type of water purifier i.e. in conjunction with the particle filter (11) or the carbon filter (12) or the UV based purifier (13) or in the specifically Reverse Osmosis based purifier system (14). In a specifically Reverse Osmosis based purifier system (14), the electrolytic purification system (EPS) for sanitization and purification of water may comprise of an electronic controller (10) and two EPS cells (3) placed, one at the upstream inlet end (15) of the purifier called EPS-1 (16) and the second one just before the downstream outlet end (18) of the purifier called EPS-2 (17) EP2, if required, to maintain the purity of water even in the HN tank (19). Herein, the EPS-1 (16) and the EPS-2 (17) may be identical or differing depending on the specific design requirements.<br>
Further the electronic controller (10) also provides voltage on the electrodes to release sanitizing and purification elements.<br><br><br>
