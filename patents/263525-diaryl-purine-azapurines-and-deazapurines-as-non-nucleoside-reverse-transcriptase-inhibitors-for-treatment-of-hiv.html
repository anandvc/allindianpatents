DIARYL-PURINES, -AZAPURINES AND -DEAZAPURINES AS NON-NUCLEOSIDE REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITORS<br>
FOR TREATMENT OF HIV<br>
Cross-reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/678,667, filed May 5,2005, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This application concerns certain 2-phenylamino-6-aryl amino-, 6-aryloxy-, and 6-arrythio- purines, -azapurines and -deazapurines. These compounds are non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and have potential as anti-HIV treatment.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presents a public-health and social catastrophe too well known to require documentation. One therapeutic approach to HIV has been inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; this enzyme is frequently referred to as "reverse transcriptase," abbreviated "RT." The first RT inhibitors were nucleoside analogs such as AZT and ddl. Although such nucleoside RT inhibitors were frequently effective against the wild-type virus, any single-drug treatment has been hobbled by the virus's ability to readily produce drug-resistant mutants.  This has led to an intense -search for non-nucleoside RT inhibitors ("NNRTIs") which are both effective and capable of retaining their effectiveness despite drug-resistance mutations. A recent review of NNRTIs can be found Balzami, J., 2004, Cur. Top. Med Chem. 4,921-44 (Erratum ibid. 4,1825).<br>
Four leading NNRTI are: 1) Efavirenz (4S)-6-chloro-4-(cyclopropylethynyl)-l,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,l-ben20xazin-2-one; 2) Capravirine: lH-Imidazole-2-methanol, 5-((3,5-dichlorophenyl)thio)-4-(l-methylethyl)-l-(4-pyridinylmethyl)-carbamate (ester); 3) Etravirine(TMC 125):4-((6-amino-5-bromo-2-((4-cyanophenyl)amino)-4-pyrimidinyl)oxy)-3,5-dimethy-benzonitrile; and 4) Rilpivirine (TMC-278): 4-([4-[(4-[(1E)-2-cyanoethenyl]-2,6-dimethylphenyl)amino]-2-pyrimidinyl)amino]ben2onitrile. Rilpivirine and Etravirine belong to a subclass of NNRTIs called diarylpyrmidines ("DAPY"). For a review of these DAPY NNRTIs see Ludovici, D.W., et al, 2002, Bioorg, Med. Chem Lett.<br><br>
11,2235-9. An extensive patent literature also exists for DAPY. U.S. Patent No. 6,197,779; WO 00/27850; WO 2003/016306; and WO 2004/069812, all assigned to Janssen<br>
Phannaceuticals.<br>
Diaryl compounds similar to Etravirine and Rilpivirine where the pyrimidine moiety is replaced by a purine are described in WO 2005/028479, which also is assigned to Janssen.<br>

2-Amino-3,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one. To a mixture of 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (20.0 g, 159 mmol) and NaOAc (26.0 g, 317 namol) in H2O (300 mL) at 65oC was added a solution of chloroacetaldehyde (22.0 mL, 50% in H2O,173 mmol) in H2O (22 mL) dropwise for 90 min. The mixture was stirred at 65oC for an additional 2 h and cooled to room temperature. The reaction noixture was concentrated in vacuo to one third of its original volume and stored at 4 Â°C for 16 h. The light pink precipitates were filtered, washed with an ice cold H2O (5 mL), and dried under high vacuum for 16 h. The precipitates were placed in Soxhlet exctractor and refluxed with methanol (200 mL) for 24 h. The methanol was concentrated to give 13.3 g (56%) of 2-amino-3,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one as a light pink solid.<br><br><br>
4-Chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamine. To a solution of 2-amino-3,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one (5.00 g, 33.3 mmol), dimethylaniline (4.22 mL, 41.0 mmol) and benzyltriediylammonium chloride (15.2 g, 66.6 mmol) in acetonitrile (25 mL) at room temperature under argon was added POCl3 (18.6 mL, 200 mmol) dropwise for 30 min. The mixture was refluxed at 85oC for 3 h and cooled to room temperature. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo to brown oil and to the oil was added an ice cold H2O (10 mL). The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5 by the addition of an aqueous NH4OH solution. Silica gel chromatography (CH2Cl2;MeOH = 95: 5) yielded 2.53 g (45%) of 4.chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrinudin-2-ylamine as a light yellow solid. The product was then benzylated using standard techniques.<br><br>
7-benzyl-4-(2,4,6-trimefhyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-dlpyrimidin-ylamine. 	To a<br>
solution of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (161 mg, 1.16 mmol) in l-methyl-2-pyrridone (2 mL) in a sealed tube was added NaH (46 mg, 1.16 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min and a solution of 7-benzyl-4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamine (100 mg, 0.39 mmol) in l-methyl'-2-pyrridone (1 mL) was added to the mixture. The mixture was heated at 150 oC for 16 h and cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into ice water and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 20 mL). The combined organic solution was washed with H2O (20 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried with Na2SO4, and<br><br><br>
mmol) in a polyethylene flask at -50 Â°C under argon was added 60% HF in pyridine (12 mL). To the resulting solution tert-butylnitrite (0.052 mL, 0.44 nmiol) was added dropwise for 5 min. The reaction was warmed to -40 Â°C and stirred for 30 min at the temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with CHCl3 (100 mL) and poured into K2CO3 (3 g) in a beaker. Ice water (50 mL) was carefully added to the mixture. The CHCI3 layer was separated, washed with aqueous NaHCOs solution (20 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated to dryness. Silica gel chromatography (Hexanes:EtOAc = 75:25) yielded 72 mg (68%) of 7-beii2yl-2-fluoro-4-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine as a light yellow solid.<br><br>
pyrridone (1 mL) was added NaH (34 mg, 0.86 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at<br><br>
room temperature for 15 min and a solution of 7-ben2yl-2-fluoro-4-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (62 mg, 0.17 mmol) in l-methyl-2-pyrridone (1 mL) was added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, poured into ice water, and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 20 mL). The combined organic solution was washed with H2O (20 mL) and brine (20 mL), dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated to dryness. Silica gel chromatography (Hexanes:EtOAc - 75:25) yielded 64 mg (82%) of 4-[7-benzyl-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-benzonitrile<br>
Step F:<br><br>
To a solution of 4-[7-benzyl-4-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-benzonitrile (38 mg, 0.083 mmol) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) was added aluminium chloride (55 mg, 0.42 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 160 Â°C for 4 h and cooled to room temperature. The mixture was poured into ice water and extracted with CH2CI2 (2 X 10 mL). The combined organic solution was washed with brine (10 mL), dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated to dryness. Silica gel chromatography (Hexanes:EtOAc = 50:50) yielded 15 mg (49%) of 4-[4-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenoxy)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-benzonitrile as a tan solid, <br><br><br>
7--benzyl-4-(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamine. 	To<br>
a solution of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-l-thiol (231 mg, 1.52 mmol) in l-methyl-2-pyrridone (2 mL) was added NaH (58 mg, 1.52 mmol).

Scheme 2 illustrates the 3 different pathways which provide the various substituted 9-deazapuiines. Other products are synthesized by analogous methods, which a person skilled in the art could formulate, based on the reaction sequences given above. In certain cases, the person skilled in the art would see that protecting groups might be necessary. The synthetic schemee can be summarized as follows.<br>
Benzylation of 9-deazaguanine followed by chlorination with POCl3 gives the chlorinated 9-deazapurine product. This chlorinated intermediate can either be coupled with R2 (pathway 1) followed by diazotization with t-butyl nitrite; displaced with F; coupled with R3 and de-benzylated to give the product; or it can undergo pathway 2, which is diazotization<br><br>
with t-butyI nitrite in the presence of antimony chloride followed by coupling with R2 and E3, followed by de-benzylation to afford the final product. Alternatively, pathway 3 provides for de-benzylation of the dichloro-9-deazapurine followed by the coupling with R2 and R3 respectively to provide the various substituted 9-deazapurine.<br><br>
