This application claims priority of U.S. Serial No. 60/709,511, Filed August 19, 2005, and U.S. Serial No. 11/206,981, Piled August 18, 2005; which is a Continuation-In-Part application of PCT/US2004/004646, filed on February 18, 2004, published under International Publication Number WO2004/074444 on September 2, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Serial Nos. 60/447,690, filed 19 February 2003, and 60/462,684, filed 15 April 2003, and the entire contents and disclosures of the preceding applications are incorporated by reference into this application.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. Disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the preparation and use of pharmaceutical-grade ferric organic compounds, such as ferric citrate. Uses of the pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate described herein, include, but are not limited to methods of treating various disorders in humans and non-human subjects or patients.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Uses of Iron Compounds<br>
Ferric iron containing compounds are useful in the treatment of a number of disorders, including, but not limited to, hyperphosphatemia and metabolic acidosis. See Hsu et al., "New Phosphate Binding Agents: Ferric Compounds", J Am Soc Nephrol, Vol. 10, Pages 1274-1280, 1999. Previous studies and inventions have reported the use of ferric compounds in binding with dietary phosphates, and such ferric compounds are potentially useful for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia	 in renal failure patients (U.S. Patent No. 5,753,706, 1998; U.S. Patent No. 6,903,235, 2005; CN 1315174, 2001; Yang W.C., et al., Nephrol.   Dial.     Transplant<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/LS2006/0323851717:265:270’’(2002).  Elevated amounts of phosphate in the blood<br>
can be removed by administering compounds such as ferric citrate. Once in solution, the ferric iron binds phosphate, and the ferric phosphate compounds precipitate in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in effective removal of dietary phosphate from the body. It is also believed that the absorbed citrate from ferric citrate is converted to bicarbonate which corrects metabolic acidosis, a condition common in renal failure patients.<br>
Int'l App. No. PCT/US2004/004646, filed February 18, 2004, published under Int'l Publication No. W02004/074444 on September 2, 2004, discloses a method of preparing ferric organic compounds, including ferric citrate that remains soluble over a wider range of pH than previously described preparations, and which have a large active surface area. However, commercially scalable manufacturing processes with quality control/analysis measures to ensure and/or to verify the compliance of the pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate or ferric organic compounds with established standards or specifications were not previously disclosed.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for a scalable process for synthesizing pharmaceutical-grade ferric organic compounds or ferric citrate for human use. The process needs to consistently produce ferric organic compounds or ferric citrate of the required pharmaceutical grade.<br>
This invention further discloses dosage for ferric citrate for<br>
treating of a human or non-human subject or patient.<br>
in need of the compound.  Different routes of administration are<br>
explored.<br>

 Acetone;<br>
and wherein the ferric citrate complies with at least one of the limits in the manufacture release specification in Table A .<br>
The compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate are suitable for treating hyperphosphatemia, or other disorders characterized by high serum phosphate levels. Therefore, the invention encompasses treating subjects or patients with various renal diseases; e.g., End Stage Renal Diseases (ESRD), Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or other relate kidney diseases, or subjects and patients who are on dialysis but not limited to hemodialysis.<br>
In another embodiment, the compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate may used to treat subjects or patients with metabolic acidosis. Other disorders that may be ameliorated by the conversion of citrate to bicarbonate are also encompassed by the invention described.<br>
An embodiment of a method for using the pharmaceutical composition encompasses treating a human or non-human subject or patient with chronic kidney disease. There are generally five clinical stages of chronic kidney disease, numbered 1 to 5, wherein stage 1 is the least severe and stage 5 the most severe. In the early stages, e.g., stages 1 and 2, dialysis is not required. As chronic kidney disease progresses to stage 5, a patient may require dialysis treatment three times per week. It should be noted that elevated phosphate levels are observed at all stages of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, an embodiment of the invention is a method of treating a subject or person with early or mid-stage chronic kidney disease, with a composition comprising pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate in order to achieve a lower serum phosphate level.<br>
It is a further embodiment of the invention to provide a method of treating a human or non-human subject or patient with late-stage  chronic  kidney  disease  who undergo  hemodialysis,  by<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
Administering composition  comprising  pharmaceutical-grade<br>
ferric citrate. It is known that hemodialysis is not sufficiently effective in reducing serum phosphate level. The treatment of a subject or person with late stage kidney disease is applicable whether or not the subject or person is currently undergoing hemodialysis treatment.<br>
An additional embodiment of the invention is a method of treating a subject or person with chronic kidney disease and undergoing peritoneal dialysis with the pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate-containing compositions described. It is known that peritoneal dialysis is not sufficiently effective in reducing serum phosphate levels.<br>
An additional embodiment is a method for using the pharmaceutical composition to inhibit or even reverse soft tissue mineralization, specifically calcification. Hyperphosphatemia may lead to increased calcium phosphate deposition in hard and soft tissues by increasing the likelihood of binding with free calcium to form insoluble calcium phosphate. Therefore, an effective dose of a composition comprising pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate may decrease serum phosphate levels and result in a corresponding decrease in calcium phosphate deposition.<br>
It is noteworthy that whereas ferric ion forms insoluble precipitates with phosphate-containing compounds in the lumen of the gastroinstestinal tract, the citrate component is absorbed and functions as a calcium chelator. Because chelated calcium is not available for calcium phosphate formation, administering pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate decreases may lead to reductions in both serum calcium and phosphate. This may also be expressed as leading to a decrease in the serum calcium-phosphate product. Reducing serum calcium and phosphate would be expected to reduce calcium phosphate deposition. The end result is reversing, i.e., solubilizing or dissolving, the deposited calcium phosphate.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032383<br>
The decalcitying  of a calcified soft tissue, e.g., the sclera of<br>
the eye, may be achieved by administering pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate. It is known among persons of ordinary skill in the relevant medical arts that patients with kidney disease receiving doses of ferric citrate have shown reversal of calcium deposits on the eye. Therefore, an embodiment of the invention is directed to the decalcification of soft tissue such as the eye.<br>
Kidney stones comprise calcium salts of oxalic acid or phosphates and are formed by mechanisms similar to those described above. Thus, pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate, in another embodiment of the invention provides a method of treating kidney stones, i.e., renal calculi, by promoting their dissolution.<br>
The compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate may operate according to more than one mechanism. A plausible non-limiting mechanism of action may result from the ferric ion binding phosphate in the GI tract, thus forming an insoluble ferric phosphate precipitate. This, in turn, may result in decrease the uptake of phosphate and phosphate-containing compounds from the GI tract.<br>
In view of such a mechanism, the administering of compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate via an oral route is encompassed by the inventive methods described.<br>
This invention provides a method of reversing, preventing or stabilizing soft tissue calcification of a subject, comprising administering to said subject and effective amount of a ferric citrate compound.<br>
This invention further provides a method of reversing, preventing or stabilizing soft tissue calcification of a subject, comprising administering to said subject and effective amount of a ferric citrate compound, wherein the ferric citrate compound is prepared according to a method as shown in Figures 1-4.<br><br><br>
WO 2U07/UZZ4J3	PCT/US2006/032383<br>
This invention provides a method of reversing, preventing or<br>
stabilizing soft tissue calcification of a subject, comprising administering to said subject and effective amount of a ferric citrate compound, wherein the ferric citrate compound is prepared according a method comprising the steps of:<br>
An embodiment of the invention encompasses tolerable doses of up to 15 grams per day for ferric citrate capsules and 3 0 grams per day for ferric citrate tablets.<br>
The compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate may be administered for varying periods of time. In some embodiments, the tolerability of the compositions encompassing pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate allows for long term administration when necessary.<br><br><br>

In general, hyperphosphatemia is prevalent in patients with chronic renal failure and in patients on dialysis. There is also evidence that indicate elevated serum phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product (CaxP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	        	  <br>
contribute to increased incidence of vascular, visceral, peripheral vascular and soft tissue calcification in renal disease patients<br>
Thus, it is an additional novel feature of the claimed invention to prevent or reverse calcification in renal disease patient or in a normal person. For example, dissolving kidney stones that may accompany renal failure.<br>
Phosphorous exerts a negative impact on vascular calcification by direct participation in the CaxP and indirectly in the pathogenesis and progression of hyperthyroidism. Serum calcium and phosphorous are metastable under normal circumstances, which means that their concentrations are not sufficient to produce spontaneous precipitation. However, once the calcification process begins, the concentrations are sufficient to support crystal proliferation.<br>
Available evidence confirms a high prevalence of underlying vascular disease and structural heart disease in patients with severe chronic renal failure. These structural lesions are then exposed to elevated serum phosphorus, CaxP, and PTH(l).<br>
Factors which are considered likely to contribute to elevated serum phosphorus and CaxP include administration of calcium-containing phosphorus binders. The calcium-containing phosphorus binders, such as calcium acetate are prescribed to many new hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, thus providing a large source of exogenous calcium to the GI tract.<br>
Calcification also extends beyond renal disease patients and can include anyone who is over the age of 40. While the leading cause of death in the United States is acute myocardial infarction and stroke, hypercholesteremia contribute to only 15% of the deaths in this category and 85% is caused by ventricular calcification.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
 It  has been Shown that  abnormalities in serum phosphorous, CaxP<br>
and PTH levels can result in vascular, visceral and/or soft tissue calcification. For example, calcifications of myocardium, coronary arteries, cornea can lead to the development of a number of clinically significant complications including myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, impaired myocardial function, congestive heart failure, cardiac valve insufficiency and blindness.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for methods of managing or reducing serum phosphorous as a means of treating numerous medical disorders. The method includes administering a phosphate binder which does not adversely affect serum calcium levels and does not cause toxic side effects in the patient.<br>

Example 2. Solubility Profile of Ferric Organic Compounds According to the Invention<br>
The ferric organic compounds produced according to the methods described above are more soluble than commercially available ferric organic compounds, over a wider range of pH levels. This increase in solubility of the ferric organic compounds of the present invention is believed to be a result of the unique significantly large active surface area of the ferric organic compounds of the present invention. For example, at pH 8.0, the intrinsic dissolution rate of ferric citrate of the present invention is 3.08 times greater than the commercially available ferric citrate. See  Table 1.<br>
The intrinsic dissolution rates of commercially available ferric citrate were compared with the ferric citrate of the present invention. The intrinsic dissolution rate is defined as the dissolution rate of pure substances under the condition of constant surface area. The dissolution rate and bioavailability of a drug substance is influence by its solid state properties: crystallinity, amorphism, polymorphism, hydration, solvation, particle size and particle surface area. The measured intrinsic dissolution rate is dependent on these solid-state properties and is typically determined by exposing a constant surface area of a<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
material to an appropriate dissolution medium while maintaining<br>
constant temperature,  stirring rate,  and pH.  The intrinsic dissolution rates are presented in Table 1.<br>

PAN031203E (experimental batch 5)	4.4	3.13	<br>
For example, the BET active surface area of the ferric citrate of the present invention is at least 16 times larger than the commercially available ferric citrate. See Table 2.<br>
The analysis of active surface area is based on BET theory which describes the phenomenon of mass and energy interaction and phase changes during gas adsorption onto solid surfaces and in pore spaces. In BET active surface area measurement, the volume of a monolayer of gas is determined which allows the surface area of the sample to be determined using the area occupied by a single layer of adsorbed gas molecule. Table 4 is a comparison of the active surface area of the ferric citrate of the present<br><br><br>

Example 3. Use of Ferric Organic Compounds According to the Invention in the Treatment of Disorders<br>
The ferric organic compounds produced according to the methods described above are useful in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and any other disorders responsive to ferric organic compound therapy. Because the ferric organic compounds of the present invention are more soluble than commercially available ferric organic compounds, smaller amounts of the ferric organic compounds of the present invention can be used to effectively treat patients suffering from such disorders.<br>
Improved aqueous solubility is particularly relevant to the use of the ferric organic compounds of the present invention in the treatment of disorders responsive to ferric organic compound therapy. Because the ferric organic compounds of the present invention are more soluble, they will be more effective when taken orally, and therefore can be taken in lower doses. The ferric organic compounds of the present invention are more soluble over a wider pH range than commercially available ferric organic compounds,- therefore, the ferric organic compounds of the present invention can be more effective by being soluble in the small intestine.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
For example, m an experiment simulating the alkaline condition<br>
in the small intestine, the ferric citrate of the present invention showed better dissolution rate than the commercially-available ferric citrate. It is suggested that the ferric citrate of the present invention can be more effective by being more soluble in the small intestine. See Table 1. As a result, patients can take lower doses of medication with lower incidences of side effects.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the ferric citrate of the present invention has a significantly higher rate of aqueous solubility under physiological conditions than commercially available forms of ferric citrate, and therefore the ferric citrate of the present invention is believed to provide a significant improvement in the orally effective use of ferric citrate at a reduced dosage. By reducing the orally effective dose of ferric citrate, it is believed that the ferric citrate of the present invention will provide a lower incidence of ulcerative gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with commercially available ferric citrate compounds. In addition, it is believed that the increased rate of dissolution of the ferric citrate of the present invention will provide a more rapid onset of action in binding to dietary phosphate.<br>
The ferric organic compounds of the present invention can be administered in a number of forms, including orally administrable forms, which can comprise the ferric organic compounds of the present invention alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The orally administrable form includes, but is not limited to, a tablet, a powder, a suspension, an emulsion, a capsule, a granule, a troche, a pill, a liquid, a spirit, or a syrup. The composition can be administered to human beings or other animals suffering from illnesses responsive to ferric organic compound therapy.<br><br><br>

Example 9 Methods of Using and Testing the Pharmaceutical-Grade Ferric Citrate in Patients In Vivo<br>
A. Handling and Forms of Test Compositions<br>
Ferric citrate is supplied in 500 mg capsules, whereas the placebo will be provided in identical-looking capsules (indistinguishable from those containing the active drug); the placebo capsules will contain sorbitol and colorant to match the powder color of the active capsules. The placebo capsule shells will be identical to the active capsule shells.<br>
Storage<br>
All study drug supplies must be stored under secure conditions and are not to be used after their expiration date, which is imprinted on the study drug container. The study drugs should be kept under controlled conditions (15 to 30°C; 59 to 86°F) in a tightly closed container, protected from light.<br>
Dosage<br>
A recent pilot study compared ferric citrate (3 g daily) to calcium carbonate (3g daily) for reducing serum P04 in patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Although ferric citrate caused a significant decrease in serum P04, it was not as effective as calcium carbonate. This dose of ferric citrate was associated with mild, but tolerable GI symptoms.<br>
As shown in Figures 12 and 13, treatments using pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate provide several advantages over chemical grade ferric citrate. In general, while pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate demonstrates an efficacy approximately equal to that of chemical grade ferric citrate, it achieves this result with less adverse side effects than chemical grade ferric citrate.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/0323 Figure 12 also indicates that adverse side effects associated<br>
with administering pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate were not statistically different from those associated with the placebo. An advantage of this safety profile is that an individual patient may have his dosing of pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate titrated over a broad range of doses with less concern about side effect. In this way, a patient's individual treatment may be tailored to suit his specific needs and tolerances.<br>
The doses of ferric citrate chosen for study or treatment may be from 1 to 3 0 grams of ferric citrate per day. In part, this may depend on the nature of the formulation provided. For example, ferric citrate capsules may be administered up to a daily dose of about 15 grams/day, whereas the tablet form may be administered up to 30 grams/day. Thus, there is a very broad range of dosing regimens encompassed by the invention.<br>
Titration of Optimal Dosage for a Subject<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "subject" refers to<br>
either a human or non-human animal.<br>
The optimal dosage of an individual subject or groups may be determined as follows. A dose of approximately one or two grams per day is merely suggested as an illustrative starting dose. The daily dose may be increased as needed until the desired result is observed.<br>
The intent of the invention is to not limit the dose range employed. Therefore, depending on the subject (s) the daily dose administered may approximate thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety or one hundred grams per day. The safety profile of the pharmaceutical-grade ferric citrate allows the implementation of a broad range of doses.<br>
Further, it is the intent of the invention to not be limited to capsules and tablets as oral formulations.  It is known in the<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
Art  that a wide variety' "of oral formulations may be adapted for<br>
use with the invention.<br>
Illustrative Example of a Dosage Regimen<br>
An non-limiting example of a dosing regimen is provided below. This is not meant to limit the invention as to how an effective amount of ferric citrate is selected, or the form in which it is provided or the frequency of administering the composition per day. The following merely illustrates how ferric citrate and placebo may be administered; e.g., as 500 mg capsules of identical appearance. All patients may receive (in a blinded fashion) 4 capsules with each of three meals, on a daily basis, for 28 days. Patients will be instructed to take the study medication within 10 minutes of finishing their meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner).<br>

C.  Data Management and Analysis<br>
GloboMax will be the primary data management, monitoring, and coordinating center. Case report forms (CRF) will be provided for each subject. Subjects will not be identified by name or initials on CRFs. The CRF will be monitored at the clinical sites and collected by GloboMax's study monitor. Audited CRFs will be used to create electronic data files.<br>
Three major categories of endpoints reflect biochemical and clinical issues being addressed at the outset. Additional clinical and biochemical issues are addressed as they arise. Therefore, the endpoints are not meant to limit the totality of relevant findings and measurements collected in these, or future studies.<br>
Primary Endpoints (see Figures 9-10)<br>
• The change in serum P04 concentration at Days 14 and 28 from baseline.<br>
Secondary Endpoints (see Figures 9-10)<br>
•	The change in serum calcium concentration at Days 14 and 28 from baseline.<br>
•	The change in iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation percentage, and total iron binding capacity at Days 14 and 28 from baseline.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/022435	PCT/US2006/032385<br>
The change in the ca po4   product at Days 14 and 28 from    baseline.<br>
It is further noted that in comparison to chemical grade ferric citrate, the pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate demonstrates similar efficacy. See Figure 13. However, the safety profiles indicate that the pharmaceutical grade generally results in less adverse clinical effects.  See Figure 13.<br>
Safety Endpoints (see Figure 11)<br>
Safety will be monitored by recording adverse events (Figure 11) and the results of physical examinations, vital signs and laboratory tests at each study visit.<br>
Specific rules for withdrawal from the study, based on laboratory data, have also been set up to ensure patient safety. A nonlimiting example of such criteria is illustrated by the following:<br>
If a patient's serum phosphate level increases to &gt;10 mg/dL at any time during the study period, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.<br>
Specific studies have also shown that pharmaceutical grade ferric citrate possesses similar efficacy to chemical grade ferric citrate. (See Figure 13) . However, the pharmaceutical grade generally affords a significantly more desirable safety profile as shown in Figure 12. This indicates an important advance in regulating serum phosphate levels.<br><br><br>
