				<td>TOTKNO-PYRIDINE DERIVATIVES AS MEK INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to a class of thieno-pyridine derivatives and to then-use in therapy. More particularly, the invention is concerned with thieno[2,3-6]pyridine derivatives which are substituted in the 2-position by a substituted anilino moiety. These compounds are selective inhibitors of MEK (MAPKK) enzymes, and are accordingly of benefit as pharmaceutical agents, especially in the treatment of adverse inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, proliferative (including oncological) and nociceptive conditions.<br>
MEK enzymes are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological functions that are believed to be operative in a range of human diseases. These functions are summarised in paragraphs [0004] and [0005] of US 2005/0049276 Al.<br>
The compounds of use in the present invention, being potent and selective MEK inhibitors, are therefore beneficial in the treatment and/or prevention of various human ailments. These include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid . arthritis, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and transplant rejection; cardiovascular disorders including thrombosis, cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, and irregular contractility of the heart (e.g. during heart failure); proliferative disorders such as restenosis, and oncological conditions including leukaemia, glioblastoma, lymphoma, melanoma, and human cancers of the liver, bone, skin, brain, pancreas, lung, breast, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate, ovary and cervix; and pain and nociceptive disorders, including chronic pain and neuropathic pain.<br>
In addition, the compounds of use in the present invention maybe beneficial as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents. Thus, the compounds of use in this invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting compounds capable of binding to human MEK enzymes.<br>
MEK inhibitors based on a fused bicyclic aromatic ring system attached to a substituted anilino moiety are known from the art. Examples of relevant publications include WO 2005/051906, WO 2005/023251, US-A-2005/0049276, WO 2005/009975, WO 03/077914 and WO 03/077855.<br>
WO 2005/023818 describes a broad-ranging class of compounds based on a fused bicyclic aromatic ring system, which generically encompasses thieno-pyridine derivatives<br>
attached to a substituted anilino moiety but nowhere specifically discloses, any precise compound of this type. No discrete pharmacological activity, in terms of an identifiable pharmacological mechanism, is ascribed to the compounds described therein, but they are nevertheless stated to be useful inter alia in the treatment of cell proliferative diseases such as cancer. US-A-2003/0220365 is also of relevance in a related context.<br>
Nowhere in the prior art, however, is there the precise disclosure of a class of thieno[2,3-6]pyridine derivatives attached at the 2-position to a substituted anilino moiety. It has now been found that such compounds are particularly valuable as selective inhibitors of MEK enzymes.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are potent and selective MEK inhibitors having a binding affinity (IC50) for the human MEK1 and/or MEK2 enzyme of 50 uM or less, generally of 20 uM or less, usually of 5 uM or less, typically of 1 uM or less, suitably of 500 nM or less, ideally of 100 nM or less, and preferably of 20 nM or less (the skilled person will appreciate that a lower IC50 figure denotes a more active compound). The compounds of the invention may possess at least a 10-fold selective affinity, typically at least a 20-fold selective affinity, suitably at least a 50-fold selective affinity, and ideally at least a 100-fold selective affinity, for the human MEK1 and/or MEK2 enzyme relative to other human kinases.<br>

Where they are not commercially available, the starting materials of formula (HI) and (V) may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples, or by standard methods well known from the art.<br>
It will be understood that any compound of formula (I) initially obtained from any of the above processes may, where appropriate, subsequently be elaborated into a further compound of formula (I) by techniques known from the art. By way of example, a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 represents -CO2Ra may be converted into the corresponding compound wherein R3 represents -CONH2 by treatment with ammonia, typically in a lower alkanol solvent, e.g. ethanol, at elevated temperature and pressure.

A compound of formula (I) wherein R3 represents -CO2Ra may be converted into the<br>
eorresponding compound wherein R3 represents hydrogen by treatment with an alkaline reagent such as lithium hydroxide under forcing conditions, e.g. by heating at reflux in a mixture of ethanol and water. A compound of formula (I) wherein R3 contains a 2,2-dimethyl-[l,3]dioxolan-4-ylmethyl moiety may be converted into the corresponding compound wherein R3 contains a 2,3-dihydroxypropyl moiety by treatment with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid. A compound of formula (I) wherein R contains a nitrogen atom to which a tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) group is attached may be converted into the corresponding compound wherein R3 contains an N-H functionality by treatment with an acid, e.g. a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid such as Ixifluoroacetic acid.

Where a mixture of products is obtained from any of the processes described above for the preparation of compounds according to the invention, the desired product can be separated therefrom at an appropriate stage by conventional methods such as preparative HPLC; or column chromatography utilising, for example, silica and/or alumina in conjunction with an appropriate solvent system.<br>
Where the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may Be separated by conventional techniques. In particular, where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of formula (I) this may be produced from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, maybe produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (I), e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation, and the desired enantiomer<br>
recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt. In another resolution process a racemate of formula (I) may be separated using chiral HPLC. Moreover, if desired, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above. Alternatively, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by performing an enantiomer-specific enzymatic biotransformation, e.g. an ester hydrolysis using an esterase, and then purifying only the enantiomerically pure hydrolysed acid from the unreacted ester antipode. Chromatography, recrystallisation and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular geometric isomer of the invention.<br>
During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3rd edition, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient subsequent stage utilising methods known from the art.<br>
