				<td>Steel for the production of high-strength components with<br>
excellent low-temperature toughness and uses of a steel of<br>
this type<br>
The invention relates to a steel for the production of high-<br>
strength components with excellent low-temperature toughness.<br>
Steels of this type are used, for example, for the<br>
manufacture of stop or clamping means, such as are required<br>
for fastening and securing loads. These steels are, in<br>
particular, processed to form hot-rolled bar steel, rolled<br>
wire or bright steel, from which welded round steel chains<br>
are then made.<br>
The demands placed on steels of the aforementioned type are<br>
set out in DIN 17 115. In addition to good deformability and<br>
equally good suitability for welding, the steels have to have<br>
excellent strength and toughness properties in order to meet<br>
the requirements that are set as a result of the stresses<br>
that occur in practice.<br>
The high-grade steels 23 MnNiCrMo 5 3 and 23 MnNiCrMo 54,<br>
which are known for this purpose and are specified in DIN 17<br>
115, respectively comprise (in % by weight) 0.20 to 0.26 % C,<br>
= 0.25 % Si, 1.10 to 1.40 % Mn, respectively 0.020 % P and S,<br>
the sum of the contents of P and S not exceeding 0.035 %, if<br>
necessary 0.020 to 0.050 % Al, up to 0.014 % N and 0.40 to<br>
0.60 % Cr. 0.20 to 0.30 % Mo and 0.70 to 0.90 % Ni are also<br>
added to the steel 23 MnNiCrMo 5 2, whereas the steel 23<br>
MnNiCrMo 5 4 additionally contains 0.50 to 0.60 % Mo and 0.90<br>
to 1.10 % Ni.<br>
Another steel for the manufacture of chains intended for<br>
securing or mooring ships or drilling platforms is known from<br>
Chinese patent publication CN-1281906. The Abstract of this<br><br>
publication, which is available in the WPINDEX database,<br>
discloses that the known steel contains (in % by weight) 0.25<br>
to 0.35 % C, 0.15 to 0.30 % Si, 1.45 to 1.75 % Mn, 0.90 to<br>
1.40 % Cr, 1.00 to 1.20 % Ni, 0.45 to 0.65 % Mo, 0.02 to 0.06<br>
% Nb, 0.020 to 0.05 % Al, up to 0.020 % P, up to 0.15 % S, up<br>
to 0.20 % Cu, up to 0.03 % Sn, up to 0.01 % Sb, up to 0.04 %<br>
As, up to 0.005 % B, up to 0.009 % N, up to 0.0020 % 0, up to<br>
0.0002 % H, the remainder being Fe and inevitable impurities,<br>
wherein a carbon equivalent also has to be greater than 1.4.<br>
Practical experience has shown that although the known steels<br>
meet the requirements set with respect to strength and<br>
toughness at ambient temperature, problems arise, especially<br>
with regard to toughness, at lower temperatures.<br>
The object of the invention was therefore to provide a high-<br>
strength steel that has excellent toughness even at low<br>
temperatures, so the risk of the component, which is produced<br>
in each case from the steel, breaking is reduced to a minimum<br>
even under unfavourable, hard operating conditions.<br>
Advantageous uses of this steel are also to be specified.<br>
With regard to the steel, this object is achieved, according<br>
to the invention, in that steel according to the invention<br>
for the production of high-strength components with excellent<br>
low-temperature toughness has the following composition (in %<br>
by weight):<br>
C: 0.08 to 0.25 %,<br>
Si: 0.10 to 0.30 %,<br>
Mn: 0.80 to 1.60 %,<br>
P: = 0.020 %,<br>
S: = 0.015 %,<br>
the sum of the P and S content being = 0.030 %,<br><br>
Cr: 0.40 to 0.80 %,<br>
Mo: 0.30 to 0.50 %,<br>
Ni: 0.70 to 1.20 %,<br>
Al: 0.020 to 0.060 %,<br>
N: 0.007 to 0.018 %,<br>
V: = 0.15 %,<br>
Nb: = 0.07 %,<br>
the sum of the V and Nb content being = 0.020 %, the<br>
remainder being iron and inevitable impurities.<br>
In the case of steel according to the invention, the<br>
individual alloy components are selected such that a property<br>
profile that optimally satisfies the requirements set is<br>
achieved. This is achieved by the contents of Cr, Ni and N<br>
that are set according to the invention and the minimum sum<br>
of the contents of Nb and V. If the content ranges of these<br>
alloy elements that are set according to the invention are<br>
adhered to, a particularly high toughness, good<br>
hardenability, improved retention of hardness when tempering<br>
and a particularly fine grain structure are achieved. Steel<br>
according to the invention is also highly cold formable and<br>
has high strength in the finished processed state. It is also<br>
distinguished by high notch impact toughness and a low<br>
fracture appearance transition temperature such that brittle<br>
fracture occurs only at temperatures that are substantially<br>
lower than the brittle fracture temperature of steels known<br>
from the prior art.<br><br><br><br>
The C-contents located in the range from 0.08 to 0.25 % by<br>
weight ensure the good low-temperature resistance of steels<br>
according to the invention. Particularly positive results are<br>
produced in this connection if the C content is from 0.16 to<br>
0.23 % by weight.<br>
The good hardenability and retention of hardness when<br>
tempering of the steel according to the invention are<br>
achieved by means of the limitation of the Cr contents to<br>
0.40 to 0.80 % by weight in combination with Mo contents from<br>
0.30 to 0.50 % by weight. The degree of certainty with which<br>
this combined effect is achieved may be increased in that the<br>
Cr contents are adjusted to 0.40 to 0.65 % by weight and the<br>
Mo contents to 0.35 to 0.50 % by weight.<br>
Ni contents from 0.70 to 1.20 % by weight, in particular 0.75<br>
to 1.00 % by weight, bring about the good low-temperature<br>
toughness that is to be emphasised, in particular, in steel<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The contents of Al from 0.020 to 0.060 % by weight, in<br>
particular 0.020 to 0.045 % by weight, and of N from 0.007 to<br>
0.018 % by weight, in particular 0.007 to 0.015 % by weight,<br>
lead in steels according to the invention to a particularly<br>
fine grain structure.<br>
Finally, the fact that steel according to the invention<br>
contains in total at least 0.02 % by weight Nb and V, while<br>
the contents of V are limited to at most 0.15 % by weight and<br>
of Nb to at most 0.07 % by weight, ensures that the desired<br>
fine grain structure is still maintained even at elevated<br>
temperatures. It has surprisingly been found in this<br>
connection that this effect occurs particularly reliably if<br>
the steel according to the invention is free of vanadium.<br><br>
According to a preferred configuration, there is therefore no<br>
V whatsoever in steel according to the invention, or it is<br>
present only as an inevitable impurity.<br>
The fine grain remains stable even in the course of the<br>
temper-hardening treatment. Finished processed steel<br>
according to the invention therefore commonly has an<br>
austenite grain size that is finer than ASTM 10. The fineness<br>
of the structure of steel according to the invention is<br>
therefore substantially greater than that of known steels,<br>
for which an austenite grain size of ASTM 5 is required<br>
according to DIN 17 115.<br>
The invention therefore provides a steel that has excellent<br>
toughness even at low temperatures. As a result of the<br>
favourable combination of its properties, the risk of a<br>
component produced from steel according to the invention<br>
breaking is reduced to a minimum even under unfavourable,<br>
hard operating conditions.<br>
Steel according to the invention is preferably processed to<br>
rolled steel. The aim of the processing is to preserve via<br>
each of the processing steps the finest possible grain<br>
structure of the steel according to the invention. This<br>
includes not only the process steps carried out during the<br>
heating and rolling, but also the annealing treatments that<br>
are carried out before and after the component formation.<br>
According to the invention, the heating and rolling<br>
conditions are thus selected such that despite the diffusion<br>
processes that occur during heating, high rolling<br>
temperatures may be avoided, in order to suppress the<br>
formation of coarse grain. The temperatures during the<br>
further deformation are also selected by means of a<br>
controlled withdrawal of energy during the heat deformation<br>
such that the desired construction with its fine grain<br><br>
structure is maintained. An accelerated withdrawal of heat<br>
immediately after the final deformation step prevents, in the<br>
sense of a "freezing" of the ultimately achieved structure<br>
state, undesirable precipitation processes that would<br>
otherwise result in a decrease in the hardness and toughness.<br>
Instead, by a long-term heat treatment desired precipitation<br>
states of the carbonitrides with respect to the size and<br>
distribution thereof are produced, in order to obtain the<br>
relatively Low material strengths of the steel in the hot-<br>
rolled state that is desired for cold forming of the steel to<br>
form the respective component.<br>
As a result of its particular property spectrum, steel<br>
according to the invention is particularly suitable for the<br>
production of high-strength components by cold forming with<br>
subsequent temper-hardening. These components may, for<br>
example, be means for the carrying, pulling, lifting,<br>
conveying or securing of loads that are allocated to the<br>
highest strength class. Such articles, which may be<br>
summarised under the general term "stop and clamping means",<br>
include, for example, attachment points, hooks, clips,<br>
eyelets, chains, joints, catch elements, rockers, braces,<br>
spindle and ratchet clamps, attachment eyes and the like.<br>
Means for the connection of structural elements having<br>
excellent use properties may also be made from steel<br>
according to the invention. These structural elements are,<br>
for example, bolts or other connecting or force transmission<br>
elements, such as screws, clamps, rods or the like.<br>
One field of application for which steel according to the<br>
invention is particularly suitable is the manufacture of<br>
chains. Chains made of steel of the composition according to<br>
the invention reliably withstand heavy loads even at very<br>
cold temperatures, without any risk of fracture or comparable<br><br>
damage. Round steel chains, especially welded round steel<br>
chains, which are able to satisfy even the most stringent<br>
requirements, may thus be made of steel according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The components made of steel according to the invention<br>
commonly have a strength of at least 1,200 MPa, in particular<br>
more than 1,550 MPa, 1,600 MPa or 1,650 MPa. It should be<br>
emphasised in this connection that at a strength of at least<br>
1,550 MPa, the fracture appearance transition temperature<br>
FATT of the components made of steel according to the<br>
invention is commonly at most -60 °C. This limit temperature<br>
is significantly lower than in known steels.<br>
It is equally notable that the notch impact working value, in<br>
the case of components produced from steel according to the<br>
invention, is commonly more than 45 J and the respective<br>
component has a technical crack initiation toughness JIC of<br>
more than 170 N/mm at -60 °C, in particular more than 185<br>
N/mm. The crack initiation toughness JIC is a value defined in<br>
the ASTM 1820 that allows evaluation of the ductile fracture<br>
tendency of a steel material.<br>
The high degree of toughness of the steel according to the<br>
invention is also discernible in the fact that components<br>
produced from steel of this type commonly exhibit an<br>
elongation at break of more than 28 %.<br>
The invention will be described below in greater detail with<br>
reference to an embodiment.<br>
A steel comprising (in % by weight)<br>
0.19 % C,<br>
0.20 % Si,<br>
1.31 % Mn,<br>
0.005 % P,<br>
0.010 % S,<br>
P content + S content = 0.015 %,<br>
0.45 % Cr,<br>
0.37 % Mo,<br>
0.88 % Ni,<br>
0.400 % Al,<br>
0.008 % N,<br>
0.01 % V,<br>
0.06 % Nb,<br>
(V content + Nb content = 0.07 %),<br>
the remainder being Fe and inevitable impurities,<br>
was melted and processed to form a rolled steel. In order to<br>
ensure the finest possible grain structure of the obtained<br>
product after the hot rolling, the rolling temperatures were<br>
kept at a low level during the hot rolling. Moreover, cooling<br>
of the rolled product was carried out between each rolling<br>
step, in order to dissipate heat produced by the hot forming<br>
itself. Immediately after the hot rolling, the obtained hot-<br>
rolled product was quenched in order to freeze the fine grain<br>
structure of the steel that is present on leaving the hot<br>
rolling path such that it is also reliably preserved in the<br>
subsequent processing steps.<br>
After the hot rolling and a long-term heat treatment, which<br>
was carried out in order to set a beneficial strength for the<br>
subsequent cold forming, the rolled steel was shaped to form<br>
chain links, which were closed by welding once the chain had<br>
been assembled.<br>
The chains produced in this manner exhibited a fine grain<br>
structure of ASTM 11, a strength of 1,270 N/mm2 and a<br>
fracture appearance transition temperature FATT determined at<br>
this strength of -70 °C. Their notch impact working value was<br>
557 J at -60 °C test temperature and the elongation at break<br>
was 2 8 %.<br>
In the accompanying diagram, the course of the ductile<br>
fracture value J integral for steel according to the<br>
invention is plotted over the crack expansion REW at a<br>
temperature of -60 °C for a standardised initial crack length<br>
a/w of 0.4. It may be seen that there is a crack initiation<br>
toughness JIC of 185 N/mm2 at the technically relevant start<br>
of the stable crack expansion.<br>
