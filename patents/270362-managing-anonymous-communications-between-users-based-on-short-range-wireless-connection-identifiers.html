TELECOM ITALIA S.P.A., an Italian company   of Piazza Degli Affari, 2, 1-20123 Milano, Italy,<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
MANAGING ANONYMOUS COMMUNICATIONS BEWEEN USERS BASED ON SHORT-RANGE WIRELESS :ONNECTION IDENTIFIERS<br>
***** DESCRIPTION<br>
-The present invention relates to a method and a system 5  for wireless communications.<br>
Wireless communications in the form of cellular phones and their supporting communications network have led to changes in the ways that people, particularly the young, meet, socialize and communicate.<br>
10 For example, US2002/0007396 discloses a technique for chatting using a plurality of mobile terminals connected to a server device through a network. The server device generates a plurality of chat rooms divided based on a geographical standard related to the<br>
15 current position of each user; selects a chat room in which a user at a terminal is to participate, based on information relating to the current position of the terminal posted from each terminal; and mixes voices of users transmitted via terminals of respective users who<br>
20 participate in the same chat room selected at the step of selecting a chat room.<br>
FriendZone service, developed by Valis LTD, Israel, allows user of cellular phones to establish communications with other cellular phone users by the<br>
25 mediation of a server device. The service allows the users to create buddy lists by adding friend, based on their approval, using phone numbers as identifier, to view their buddies' virtual presence, send them textual messages and view their location. Moreover, the service<br>
30 allows users to anonymously exchange textual messages in virtual chat room, to define their personal profile, to define a preferred matching profile, to perform an<br>
CONFIRMATION COPY<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
2<br>
automatic match of two users, based on their profiles and their location. Further, the service allows users to send anonymous SMS (Short Message Service) to other users, without knowing their phone numbers.<br>
5 Techniques enabling interactions among cellular phone users which make use of the so-called Bluetooth™ wireless technology are also known in the art.<br>
Bluetooth is a standard and an industrial specification developed by a group of electronics manufacturers that<br>
10  allows any sort of electronic equipment, from computers<br>
and cell phones to keyboards and headphones, to connect<br>
and exchange  information via wireless,  short  range<br>
(from 10 to 100 meters) radio frequency connections.<br>
Wireless  communications  among  cellular  phone  users<br>
15 which make use of the Bluetooth™ technology allow free<br>
messages to be exchanged among the users. Moreover,<br>
they may be implemented by using relatively low power<br>
consumption and .low cost transceiver, in the user<br>
cellular phone.	<br>
20 Nathan Eagle and Alex Pentland (Research Work "Social Serendipity: Proximity Sensing and Cueing", MIT Media Laboratory Technical Note 580, May 2004) disclose a system that allows proximate people to be detected and identified by using the Bluetooth wireless technology<br>
25  and to be matched from a database of user profiles.<br>
Bluetooth enabled cellular phones continuously transmit<br>
via Bluetooth standard a unique identification code<br>
(BTID) that can be received by other Bluetooth cellular<br>
phones. Every time a cellular phone discovers a new<br>
30 device by the Bluetooth discovery function that 'was not previously detected such information is recorded in a proximity log and sent to a central server utilizing a mobile network connection. ., The server maintains a database containing users' profiles, and a similarity<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
3<br>
score is calculated on the basis of the user" profiles and preferences. If the score is above the thresholds set by both users, the server alerts the users that there is someone in their proximity (according to the 5 Bluetooth discovery indications) whom might be of interest.<br>
Moreover, BEDD™ service, by BEDD Corporation, allows cellular phone users to communicate and interact with each other by using Bluetooth wireless technology. The<br>
10 users have to fill-in a short profile describing who they are and who they would like to meet. The BEDD system, while running in the background of the cellular phones, automatically exchanges user profiles, as well as advertisements about things they would like to buy<br>
15 or sell, with others that come within the Bluetooth range of distances. Then, it alerts a user when others within the Bluetooth range are found which match with the user specific personalized criteria and enables free chats- and instant messaging via Bluetooth wireless<br>
20 technology, within the Bluetooth range, or conventional •mobile contacts via SMS, MMS, Call or E-mail.<br>
The Applicant notes that these two latter techniques based on the Bluetooth technology have the drawback of not  allowing  two  users  which  start  an  anonymous<br>
25 communication within the Bluetooth range of distances to maintain the established anonymous communication, once outside the Bluetooth range of distances. Indeed, the users cannot continue communicating unless they previously exchanged their telephone numbers  and/or<br>
30 email addresses to take up again the communication via a conventional non-anonymous contact. Also, these two techniques do not provide . the possibility to continue the established anonymous communication with increased communication . capabilities,  such as exchanging large<br>
35  size messages or the like which require large bandwidth<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
and/or greater functionality.<br>
The Applicant thus faced the technical problem of providing the users of mobile apparatuses with the capability of continuing an anonymous communication 5 established with other users according to the Bluetooth wireless technology or to another comparable short-range wireless technology, even when the short-range connectivity is ■ lost or . increased communication functionality is needed.<br>
10 Therefore, in a first aspect the present invention relates to a method for managing in a network equipment of a communication network anonymous communications between a first and a second mobile user apparatus, the method comprising<br>
15 a) receiving from the first mobile user apparatus, through a first network connection, data indicating that a short-range wireless connection between the first, mobile user apparatus and the second mobile user apparatus has been established,<br>
20 said data comprising a second unique. short-range wireless connection identifier associated with the second mobile user apparatus and a message for the second mobile user apparatus;<br>
b)	by using said second unique short-range wireless<br>
25       connection identifier, obtaining a network address<br>
associated with the second mobile user apparatus; and<br>
c)	by using the network address obtained in b),<br>
sending data .to the second mobile user apparatus<br>
30 through a second network connection, said data comprising the message . received in a) from the first mobile user appa'fatus and a first anonymous identifying code univocally associated with the<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
first mobile user apparatus.<br>
According to the method of the invention, when an anonymous short-range wireless connection between two mobile user apparatuses fails or is not anymore the 5 preferred one, the mobile user apparatuses may continue communicating anonymously through the intermediation of a network equipment which allows the.users to maintain their anonymity by sending to the mobile user apparatuses,  in  addition  to  the  messages  to  be<br>
10 exchanged between the users, anonymous identifying codes associated with the sender mobile user apparatuses. Indeed, the use of suitable anonymous identifying codes managed by the network equipment allows the identity of the apparatuses to be recognized<br>
15 at the network equipment without revealing it to the users of the mobile user apparatuses.<br>
In the present description and claims, the term<br>

5  The features and advantages of the present	invention<br>
will  be  made  apparent  by  the  following	detailed<br>
description  of  some  exemplary  embodiments	thereof,<br>
provided merely by way of non-limitative	examples,<br>
description that will be conducted by making	reference<br>
10  to the attached drawings, wherein:<br>

-	figures   2-5   schematically  show   a   flowchart exemplifying an embodiment of the. invention;<br>
15  Figure 1 shows a communication network 100 according to an embodiment of the invention comprising a plurality of cellular phones (or similar mobile user apparatuses) 120, 130, a mobile network 10 and a network equipment 1.<br>
20 Cellular phones 120 and 130 are adapted to communicate with the network equipment 1 through the mobile-network 10.<br>
The terms cellular phone and mobile user apparatus in the present description and claims are used to indicate 25 a cellular phone and, respectively, a mobile user, apparatus associated with a module (such as a Subscriber Identity Module - SIM), which in turn is typically univocally associated with a user of such phone or apparatus.<br>
30 Cellular phones 120 comprise a short-range transceiver adapted to establish a short-range' wireless connection according to the Bluetooth wireless technology or to a<br><br>

comparable short-range radio-frequency based wireless<br>
technology  and  have  associated  a  Bluetooth  (or<br>
equivalent)  unique  short-range  wireless  connection<br>
i identifier.  Moreover,  they' have  the  capability  of<br>
5  communicating packet data through packet data network<br>
connections and/or to send/receive SMS, MMS and other<br>
equivalent type of messages. For example, they may be<br>
Symbian,  J2ME,  MS Smartphone or comparable cellular<br>
phones.<br>
10 As these types of cellular phones are well known in the art, they will not be further described in detail hereinafter.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the following description will assume that the short-range radio-frequency 15 wireless technology is Bluetooth and that the short-range transceivers in cellular phones 120 are Bluetooth transceivers. However, it should be clear that the invention applies to comparable short-range wireless technologies as well.<br>
20 In the embodiment shown, cellular phones 130 have reduced capability with respect to cellular phones 120 in that they are not Bluetooth enabled. Typically they are also unable to run dedicated applications and to communicate packet data. Nonetheless,  cellular phone's<br>
15 130 have the capability of sending and receiving SMS and, optionally, MMS or equivalent type of messages. For example, they are conventional GSM cellular phones without the support for Bluetooth (and unable to run dedicated applications).<br>
30 The mobile network 10 may ,,be a conventional GSM-GPRS, EDGE, UMTS, mobile dial-up, Wi-Fi network or any other equivalent network or combination thereof apt to establish a connection, at least in part wireless, between the cellular phones- 120,  130 and the network<br><br>

equipment 1.<br>
As GPRS, GSM, UMTS, EDGE, mobile dial-up, Wi-Fi and equivalent technologies are well known in the art, they will not be further described in detail hereinafter.<br>
5, The mobile network 10 has associated a gateway 165 that may be of the GSM SMS-C, MMS or 3GPP IMS or equivalent type and which allows SMS messages (and/or MMS, 3GPP • IMS messages or in general multimedia contents) to be exchanged between the network equipment 1 and the 10 cellular phones 120, 130, according to techniques well known in the art.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, in the following description reference to SMS textual messages will be made, even if it should be clear that the invention 15 applies to MMS, 3GPP IMS and equivalent messages as well.<br>
In the embodiment shown, the network equipment' 1 comprises an information server 150 and a location server 170.<br>
20 The information server 150 is adapted to receive, store and send user messages from/to cellular phones' 120, 130, to handle a repository 155 for memorizing introductory user messages (as defined in more detail below) and to handle a user information database 160<br>
25 for storing and managing information about the cellular phones 120, 130 (and possibly the respective users). For example, as shown in more detail below, for each cellular phone 120, 130, the user information database 160 may store the following (or some of the following)<br>
30 parameters: an internal user identifier (IN ID), a Bluetooth short-range wireless connection identifier (UID) , a MSISDN subscriber . identifier, a messaging system connection identifier (UIN), an IP packet data<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
22<br>
network connection address and a flag indicating the on-line/off-line status within the communication network 100 (that is, whether or not the respective user has given authorization to be discovered and/or to 5  receive- messages from other users).<br>
In particular, the internal user identifier (IN_ID) is an identifier generated by the information server 150 for univocally and anonymously identifying the cellular phones 120, 130 (or more properly the SIM associated<br>
10 with such cellular phones), the Bluetooth short-range wireless connection identifier (UID) is an identifier allocated by a Bluetooth transceiver producer which univocally and anonymously identifies a Bluetooth enabled  mobile  phone  120,  the  MSISDN  subscriber<br>
15 identifier is the Mobile Subscriber ISDN number . well known in the art, the messaging system connection identifier (UIN) is a numeric code generated by the information server .150 for univocally and anonymously identifying cellular phones 120,  130 in a messaging<br>
20 system connection a's disclosed in detail below, and the IP packet data network connection address • is the IP address for univocally identifying cellular phones 120, 130 in a packet data network connection session, as well known in the art. Moreover, the information server<br>
25 150 is connected to the mobile . network 10 . for sending/receiving SMS messages to/from cellular phones 120, 130 (through gateway 165) and packet data to/from cellular phones 120.<br>
The information server 150 and the gateway 165 allow 30 anonymous SMS messages to be exchanged between cellular phones 120, 130. For example, a SMS from a sender cellular phone to an addressee cellular phone sent under the control of the information server 150 will have as addressee number the ' MSISDN subscriber 35  identifier number of the addressee cellular phone and<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
93<br>
as sender number the concatenation of a predetermined number of digits (the so-called "large account's number") which is associated with the network equipment 1 and the above mentioned messaging system connection 5 identifier (UIN) which, as disclosed above, is a numeric code generated at the network equipment 1 for univocally and anonymously identifying the sender cellular phone. In this way, the MSISDN subscriber identifier of the sender cellular phone is not sent to 10 the addressee cellular phone and anonymity of the user of the sender cellular phone is preserved.<br>
According to an embodiment, the information server 150 may generate a unique • messaging system connection identifier UIN for each cellular phone establishing a<br>
15 network connection with it. Alternatively, in order to better exploit the limited number of identifiers that can be generated with a fixed number of digits at its disposal, the information server 150 can generate the identifiers according to another preferred technique.<br>
20  In  particular,  considering  a  cellular  phone  A<br>
• establishing a network connection with the information<br>
server 150, the latter can generate a table for said<br>
cellular  phone  A  in  which  associating  a  unique<br>
messaging   system   connection   identifier   UIN   of<br>
25  progressively increasing value (e.g. UINl, UIN2, UIN3<br>
	) for each cellular phone (e.g. cellular phones B,<br>
C, D) with which cellular phone A establishes . a messaging system connection. In this way, when the information, server 150 receives a SMS having has sender<br>
30 number the MSISDN_A of cellular phone A and as addressee number the concatenation of the large-account number and a messaging system connection identifier UINx, it can determine" the identity of the addressee cellular phone from the table generated for cellular<br>
35 phone A by looking for the cellular phone with which said UINx has been associated.<br><br>

24<br>
The location server 170 is adapted to support the information server 150 for identifying the geographical position of the cellular phones 120, 130.<br>
For example,  the location server 17 0 is adapted to 5  handle a database 175 for storing the geographical position of  cellular phones. 120,  130  in terms  of latitude and longitude information.<br>
Alternative and multiple distinct technologies can be used for localizing a cellular phone.  The position<br>
10 information to be stored in the location server 170 may be directly obtained by cellular phones 120, 130 when, for example, they are equipped with a GPS receiver or may be obtained from the mobile network 10 according to techniques  well  known  in  the  art.  Moreover,  the<br>
15 geographical -position infqrmation may be dynamically updated or cached (in order to' reduce the network requests for localizing a mobile terminal) according to technologies well known in the art.<br>
The communication network 100 and, in particular, the 20 cellular phones 120, 130, the network equipment 1, the mobile network 10 and the gateway 165 comprise hardware, software and/or firmware elements adapted to implement the methods for managing anonymous communications according to the invention.<br>
25  Figures  2  to  5  show  as  a  whole  a  flow  chart<br>
exemplifying the main actions performed at two cellular<br>
phones. 120 (or, where explicitly stated, 130) #1 and #2<br>
(labelled user #1 and user #2 in the figures) and at the<br>
network equipment 1 (labelled Information Server 150) ,<br>
30  according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
For the sake of clarity, user #1 and user #2 have been considered with two different  roles. In particular, user #1 is the one who discovers and contacts and user<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
25<br>
#2 is the one discovered. Even if not shown, it should be clear that the two roles (discoverer and discovered) may be played at the same time by the same user.<br>
In figure 2, at block 200 user #1 (and user #2) switches 5 cellular phone #1 (cellular phone #2) on and prepares -through a suitable user interface (e.g. by means of a keyboard and a display unit) in cellular phone #1 (cellular phone #2) - an introductory user message to be communicated to other users.<br>
10 For example, the introductory user message may be a general unstructured textual/multimedia description or a structured description with fields for providing user personal details (e.g. age, gender, hobbies, email), and user preferences (e.g. looking for teenagers only),<br>
15 in this way allowing the definition of additional search criteria for the search performed at blocks 280, 281 disclosed hereinafter.<br>
At block 203 user #1 (and user #2) enables cellular phone #1  (and cellular phone #2) to run a dedicated<br>
20 application implementing the managing method of the invention so that cellular phone #1 (and cellular phone #2) sends to the information server 150, through a network connection, the introductory user message and user information data. The network connection may be,<br>
25 for example, an IP packet data network connection, a SMS connection or a mixed connection including both. In case of IP packet data network connection, cellular phone #1 (cellular phone #2) is assigned by the mobile network 10 an IP address  (IP1,  IP2)  and the user<br>
30 information data sent to the information server 150 comprise the Bluetooth unique .short-range wireless connection identifier (UID), UID2) and, "'optionally, the geographical position of the cellular phone. This latter information may be provided when, for example,<br><br>
WO 2007/019877	PCT7EP2005/009008<br>
26<br>
cellular phone 120 is equipped with a GPS receiver. The IP address is retrieved by the information'server 150 from the data sent on the estabilished network connection. Optionally, the information server 150 may 5 retrieve the MSISDN subscriber identifiers (MSISDN1, MSISDN2) of the cellular phones on the basis of the IP addresses, as well known in the art. In case of SMS connection, cellular phone #1 (cellular phone #2) sends a SMS to the large account number of the information<br>
10 server 150 containing the introductory user message and, optionally, the geographical position of the cellular phone. The MSISDN is retrieved by the information server 150 as the sender number of the SMS. In case of mixed connection, cellular phone #1 (cellular<br>
.15 phone #2) may send to the information server 150 the introductory user message, the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1, UID2) and, optionally, its geographical position through the established  IP packet  data network connection.  The<br>
20 MSISDN subscriber identifier may be retrieved by' the information server 150 through a SMS connection (e.g., by sending from the cellular phone to the information server 150 an empty SMS) . A user that at block 203 sends to the information server 150 said introductory<br>
25 user message implicitly gives the authorization to be discovered by other users by. means of the location server 175 and to receive messages from the other users, for example for a certain period of .time (e.g. 1 hour) after having sent such message.<br>
30 At block 205, the information server 150 receives the introductory user message and the user information data from cellular phone #1 (cellular phone #2) and, optionally, from other sources of information such as other apparatuses of the mobile network: 10; generates<br>
35  the above mentioned internal user identifier. (IN_ID1, IN _ID2)  for univocally identifying cellular  phone #1<br><br>

(cellular phone #2) and stores the received introductory-user  message  and  user  information  data  in  the repository  155  and  user  information  database  160, respectively,  by using the generated internal user 5  identifier  (IN_ID1,  IN_ID2).  At  block  207,  if  no position information has been sent to the information server 150 from cellular phone #1 (and cellular phone #2), the information server 150 interoperates with the location server 170 in order to obtain information 10  about the geographical position of cellular phone #1 (and cellular phone #2).<br>
Actions at blocks 203, 205 and 207 allow the information server 150 to be aware of the on-line cellular  phones  running  the  dedicated  application<br>
15 implementing the managing method of the invention, to assign them the internal user identifier (IN_ID) and to store the assigned internal user identifiers and the introductory user messages, UIDs, MSISDNs, IP addresses and  the  geographical  position  information  of  such<br>
20  cellular' phones.<br>
Even if not shown, the method of the invention also envisages the case in which user #2 is not currently running the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention on cellular phone #2,<br>
25 so that actions at blocks 203, 205 and 20,Y are not carried out in connection with cellular phone #2. However, this case requires that cellular phone #2 has previously already sent, at least once, its user information data to the information server 150  and<br>
30 that, thus, the latter already has at disposal the user information data of cellular phone #2, stored in the user information database 160.<br>
At block 209, cellular phone #1 performs a short-range wireless  search  according  to--' Bluetooth  wireless<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
28<br>
technology for discovering Bluetooth enabled cellular phones 120 which are within the Bluetooth range of distances covered by cellular phone #1.<br>
At block 213, it is checked whether cellular phones 5  have been discovered through the short-range wireless search performed at block 209.<br>
If no cellular phone has been discovered, the procedure continues at block 279 (see figure 5).<br>
At block 211, cellular phone #2 is discovered by the 10  short-range wireless search performed at block 209 by cellular phone #1.<br>
At block 215, cellular phone #2 sends the introductory user message prepared at block 200 and its Bluetooth unique  short-range  wireless  connection  identifier 15  (UID2) to cellular phone #1.<br>
At block 217 cellular phone #1 receives the introductory user message and the Bluetooth unique . short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) from cellular phone #2 (and, optionally, from other, cellular phones<br>
20 found by the search performed at block 209) . Then, through its user interface, cellular phone #1 provides user #1 with the introductory message of user #2, typically without displaying . the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier  (UID2)  to<br>
25  user #1.<br>
At block 219 cellular phone #1 invites user #2 to chat, preferably by sending the introductory user message prepared at block 200 and the. Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) to cellular 30  phone #2.'<br>
At  block  221,   cellular  phone  #2  receives  the introductory user message  and the'Bluetooth unique<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
29<br>
short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) from cellular phone #1 and, through its user interface, provides user #2 with the received user message, typically without displaying the Bluetooth unique 5 short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) of cellular phone #1 to user #2.<br>
At block 223, it is checked whether user #2 accepts the invitation to chat.<br>
If user #2 does not accept, the invitation, user #1 may 10 decide to perform a new search at block -209. Otherwise, even if not shown, he/she can try to invite a different user, if any, among those discovered at block 209 or to terminate the execution of the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention.<br>
15  If user #2 accepts the invitation, at block 225 cellular phone #1 sends such information (e.g. by communicating the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier UID1 and UID2 of cellular phones #1 and #2) to the information server 150 that,  at block 227,<br>
20 updates the user information database 160 accordingly. In this way, the information server 150 is aware that user #1 and #2 established a short-range wireless connection.<br>
At blocks 229 the two users #1 and #2 communicate (e.g. 25  by exchanging text, image, audio messages) through a Bluetooth short-range wireless connection.<br>
At block 231 it is checked whether the Bluetooth short-range wireless connection is on.<br>
In the affirmative case,  users #1 and #2' continue<br>
30  staying in touch and communicating at block 229 until<br>
they.wish so, or until they remain within the available<br>
Bluetooth short-range. of distances. During this time,<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCTYEP2005/009008<br><br>
30<br>
both of them can be discovered by other users, and consequently start chatting with them in a way similar to what disclosed above.<br>
If the Bluetooth short-range wireless connection fails 5 (e.g. users #1 and #2 find themselves outside the Bluetooth short-range of distances covered by cellular phones), at block 233 cellular phone #1 notifies such event to the information server 150 that, at block 235, receives and stores such information in the user 10  information database 160.<br>
Even if not shown, it can also be provided that if at block 219 the attempt of user #1 to invite user #2 to chat fails because user #2 is not anymore within the Bluetooth short-range of distances covered by cellular 15 phone #1, the procedure skips from block 219 to block 233.<br>
At block 237, cellular phone #1 sends to the information server 150, transparently to user #1 and through • a  network  connection,  data  comprising  the<br>
20 Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) of cellular phone #2 and a message for user #2. The network connection may be, for example, an IP packet data network connection or a SMS connection.  In  case  of  IP  packet  data  network<br>
25 connection, cellular phone #1 sends to the information server 150 also its Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) so as to be identified by the information server 150 while its IP address  (IP1) is retrieved by the information server<br>
30  150 itself. In case of SMS connection, the information server 150 retrieves' the MSISDN subscriber identifier of the cellular phone #1 . (as sender number of the SMS) so as to be identified by the information server 150..<br>
Even if not shown, it can also be provided that at<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PGT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
31<br>
block 237, before sending the data to the information server 150, cellular phone #1 alerts user #1 that the short-range connection with user #2 failed and that the intermediation of information server 150 is 5 intervening. Moreover, user #1 might be provided with the possibility of choosing whether continuing chatting with user #2 through the intermediation of the information server 150 or interrupting it.<br>
At block 239, the information server 150 receives the 10  data from cellular phone #1.<br>
It is noted that actions at blocks 225 and 227 (and 233, 235 too) may also be omitted. In that case, the information server 150 becomes aware that a short-range wireless connection between user #1 and #2 failed at 15 the receipt of said data from -cellular phone #1 at block 239.<br>
At block 241 the information server 150 checks in the user information database 160 whether an IP packet data network connection is established with cellular phone 20 #2, by using the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2), received at block 239.<br>
In the negative case, the procedure continues'at block 259 (see figure 4).<br>
In the affirmative case, at block 243 the information 25 server 150 retrieves the IP address (IP2) associated with the cellular phone #2 from the user information database 160 and sends to cellular phone #2, by using the retrieved IP address, the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) of cellular 30 phone #1 and the message for user #2 received at block 239 from user #1.<br>
At block 245,  cellular phone #2  receives from the<br><br>

(see figure 2), or to terminate the execution of the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention.<br>
At block 251 the information server 150, by using the 5 Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID1) received at block 249, checks in the user information database 160 whether an IP packet data network connection is established with cellular phone #1.<br>
10 ' In the negative case, the procedure continues at block 269 (see figure 4) .<br>
.In the affirmative case, at block 253 the information server 150 retrieves the IP address (IP1-) associated with the cellular phone #1 from the user information 15 database 160 and sends to cellular phone #1, by using the retrieved IP address, the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) of cellular phone #2 and the reply message for user #1, received at block 249 from user #2.<br>
20 At block 255, cellular phone #1 receives from the information server 150, through the established IP packet data network connection, the reply message and the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) of cellular phone #2 and, through its<br>
25 user interface, provides user #1 with the received user message, typically without displaying the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) of cellular phone #2 to user #1.<br>
At block 257,  at cellular phone #1 it is  checked 30  whether user #1 wishes to continue chatting with user #2.<br>

34<br>
chatting through the intermediation of the information server 150 continuing the procedure at block 237.<br>
Moreover (not shown), it can be provided that cellular phones #1 and #2 attempt to establish again a Bluetooth 5 short-range wireless connection and, in case of success, that users #1 and #2 start again chatting through the newly established Bluetooth short-range wireless connection continuing the procedure at block 229.<br>
10 If at block 257 user #1 does not wish to continue chatting, with user #2, he/she may decide to perform a new search at block 209. Otherwise, even if not shown, he/she may try to invite a different user, if any, among those already discovered at a previous execution<br>
15 of block 209 (see figure 2) , or to terminate the execution of the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention.<br>
From the actions disclosed above it is clear that the invention  allows  two  users,  which  start  chatting<br>
20 through an anonymous short-range wireless connection, to continue chatting anonymously even when they find themselves outside the short-range of distances covered by their cellular phones. This is achieved thanks to the  intervention  of  the  intermediation  of  the<br>
25 information server 150 and to a suitable management, of the UIDs and IP addresses of the cellular phones involved.<br>
Figure 4 shows the actions to be performed (blocks 259-267 or 269-277) when at block 241 or 251, respectively, 30 the information server 150 finds that there is not an established IP packet data network connection with cellular phone #2 or cellular phone #1.<br>
This may happen, for example, when user #2 and/or user<br><br>
WO 2007/019877	PCT/EP2005/009008<br>
35<br>
#1 switch their cellular phone off, or when they decide to interrupt the execution of the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention in their cellular phones or in case of a. cellular phone 5 130,- that is unable to establish packet data network connections.<br>
In particular, at block 259 the information server 150 retrieves from the user information database 160 the MSISDN2  subscriber  identifier  of  user  #2  therein<br>
10 associated with the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UID2) of cellular phone #2, received at block 239 from cellular phone #1. Moreover, it retrieves from the user information database 160 the messaging system connection identifier<br>
15 (UIN1) therein ' associated with the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UIDl) of cellular phone #1", received at block 239 from cellular phone #1. As already described above, said messaging system connection identifier .(UIN1) is a numeric code<br>
20 generated by the information server 150 for univocally identifying a cellular phone when sending anonymous SMS.<br>
At block 261, the information server 150 sends an anonymous SMS to cellular phone #2 through gateway 165.<br>
25 As already described above, the SMS will contain the message from user #1 to user #2 and will have as addressee number the MSISDN2 and as sender number the concatenation of the large account's number which represents the information server 150 and the UIN1. In<br>
30 this way, the MSISDNl subscriber identifier of cellular phone #1 is not revealed to user #2 and anonymity of user #1 is preserved.<br>
At block' 263, cellular phonen#2 receives the anonymous SMS from the information server 150 and at block 265 it<br><br>
WO. 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
36<br>
replies  to  it.<br>
At block 267, the information server 150 receives the reply message from user #2 and examines the sender number (MSISDN2') and the addressee number (large 5 account number+UINl) so as to identify the sender and addressee cellular phones, as described above.-Then the procedure continues at block 251 (figure 3).<br>
In its turn, at block 269 the information server 150 retrieves from the user information database 160 the<br>
10 MSISDN1 subscriber identifier of user #1 therein associated with the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier (UIDl) of cellular phone #1, received at block 249 from cellular phone #2. Moreover,  it  retrieves  from  the  user  information<br>
15  database 160 the messaging system connection identifier<br>
(UIN2)  therein associated with the Bluetooth unique<br>
short-range wireless connection identifier  (UID2)  of<br>
cellular phone #2, received at block 249 from cellular<br>
phone #2. As already described above, said messaging<br>
20 system connection identifier (UIN2) is a numeric code generated by the information server 150 for univocally identifying a cellular phone when sending anonymous SMS.<br>
At block 271, the information server 150 sends an 25 anonymous SMS to cellular phone #1 through gateway 165. As already described above, the SMS. will contain the message from user #2 to user #1 and will have as addressee number the MSISDN1 and as sender number the concatenation of the large account's number (LAN) which 30 represents the information server 150 and the UIN2. In this way, the MSISDN2 subscriber identifier of cellular phone #2 is not revealed to user #1 and anonymity of user #2 is preserved.<br>
At block 273, cellular phone #1 receives the anonymous<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
37<br>
SMS from the information server 150 and at block 275 it replies to it.<br>
At block 277, the information server 150 receives the reply message from user #1 and examines the sender 5 number (MSISDN1) and the addressee number (large account number+UTN2) so as to identify the sender and addressee cellular phones, as already described above. Then the procedure continues at block 241.<br>
From the above description, it is clear that actions<br>
10  disclosed with reference to figure 4, allow the users<br>
to continue communicating anonymously, by the exchange<br>
of anonymous  SMS through the intermediation of the<br>
information server 150, even when they find themselves<br>
outside the short-range of distances covered by their<br>
15  cellular phones and they have not an established packet<br>
data network connection with the network equipment 1.<br>
This is achieved thanks to the intervention of the<br>
intermediation of the information server 150 and to a<br>
suitable management of the MSISDNs of the cellular<br>
20  phones involved.<br>
Even, if not shown, it can also be provided that - when at block 241 the information server 150 finds that an IP packet data network connection is not established with cellular phone #2 - instead of implementing block<br>
25 259 of figure 4, it forces cellular phone #2 to launch and to run the dedicated application implementing the managing method of the invention and to establish a packet data network connection with it (e.g., by sending a suitable SMS to the cellular phone #2 that<br>
30 automatically activates such dedicated application) so that the procedure may continue at block 243. In this case, the user is preferably given the possibility of choosing whether .or not authorizing this forcing procedure in its cellular phone.<br><br>

Figure 5 shows the actions which may be performed when at block 213 cellular phone #1 finds no nearby cellular phone through the short-range wireless search performed at block 209 or when the user of phone #1 decide to 5  enlarge the search.<br>
In particular, at block 27 9 cellular phone #1 sends to the- information server 150 a request for cellular phones search through a network connection.<br>
At blocks 280, 281 the information server 150 receives 10 the request from cellular phone #1 and performs the search with the support of the user information database 160 and the location server 170. For example, the search may be performed by identifying, among the on-line users which have established either a packet 15 data network connection or a SMS connection with the information server 150, those that are closer to the position of the cellular phone #1. Moreover, in addition to or in place of the proximity, other search criteria may be used- as for example the time of last 20 access and/or any other preferred criteria declared by the user, for example during the initial phase at block 200, by preparing the introductory user message with a suitable structured description.<br>
At block 282, the information server 150 sends, through 25 a network connection, the result of the search to the cellular phone #1. Said result typically comprises an anonymous search identifying code univocally associated with each of at least a sub-set of the discovered cellular phones, together with the respective 30 introductory user message. The network connection may be an IP packet data network connection or a SMS connection. In case of IP packet . data network connection, the anonymous search identifying code may be the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
39<br>
identifiers (UIDn) and/or the internal user identifiers (IN_ID)for the discovered cellular phones of type 120 and the internal user identifier (IN_ID) for the discovered cellular phones of type 130. These latter 5 cellular phones 130 are discoverable in that they have previously sent, via SMS to the large account number of the information server 150, their respective introductory user messages. In case of SMS connection, the result typically comprises as many SMS as the<br>
10 number of the discovered cellular phones (or no more than a predetermined number) , each SMS containing the introductory message of the respective discovered user and having as sender number the concatenation of the large-account number and the UIN associated with the<br>
15  discovered cellular phone.<br>
At block 283, cellular phone #1 receives the result of' the search.<br>
At block 284, it is checked whether cellular phones have been discovered through the search performed by 20  the information server 150 at blocks 280, 281.<br>
If no cellular phone has been discovered, user #1 may decide to start again at block 209  (see figure 2) . Otherwise,  even  if  not  shown,  it  may  decide  to terminate the execution of the dedicated application 25  implementing the managing method of the invention.<br>
If at least one cellular phone has been found, in case of search result received through the SMS connection at blocks 285 cellular phone #1 through its user interface displays to user #1 the received SMSs and user #1 may 30 decide to reply to at least one of them (e.g. to user #2) by sending a reply SMS to the information server 150. At block 286 the information .server 150 receives the reply SMS from cellular phone #1, examines the sender number  (MSISDN1)  and addressee number  (e.g.<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/009008<br><br>
40<br>
large-account number + UIN2) to identify the sender, and addressee cellular phone and the procedure continues at block 241 (figure 3). '<br>
If at least one cellular phone has been found in case 5 of search result received through the IP packet data network connection, at block 287 cellular phone #1, through its user interface, displays to user #1 the introductory user messages of the discovered users.<br>
At block 288 user #1 decide to invite to chat at least 10 one of them (e.g. user #2) by sending to he/she the introductory user message prepared at block 200. The cellular phone #1 sends also the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifiers UIDl and the UID2 (or the received internal user identifier 15 (IN_ID2) for the selected user #2) to the information server 150.<br>
At block 289, the information server 150 receives the introductory user message, the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifiers UIDl and UID2 (or 20 the internal identifier for user #2) from cellular phone #1 and at block 290 forward the invitation to chat to cellular phone #2 via an IP packet data network connection or SMS connection, in a way similar to what already disclosed above.<br>
25 At block 2 91, cellular phone #2 receives the invitation to chat and, through its user interface, provides user #2 with the received message.<br>
User #2 can decide whether or not to accept the invitation. The decision is communicated to the 30 information server 150 (e.g. by not replying to the received message, or by communicating the decision via IP packet data network connection);; which in turns forwards user #2's decision to user #1' (actions not<br><br>
WO 2007/019877	PCT/EP2005/009008<br>
41<br>
shown in figure 5).<br>
At block 292, it is checked whether user #2 accepts the invitation to chat.<br>
If user #2 does not accept the invitation, user #1 may 5 decide to try to invite a different user, if any, among those previously discovered from the information server 150 and to start again the procedure at block 287. Otherwise, even if not shown, he/she may decide to perform a new search either at block 279 or at block 10 209, or to terminate the execution of the dedicated application which implements the managing method of the invention in cellular phone #1.<br>
If user #2 accepts the -invitation, at block 293 cellular phone #1 sends such information (e.g. by communicating<br>
15 the Bluetooth unique short-range wireless connection identifier UID1 of cellular phone #1 and the received UID2 or internal identifier for user #2) to the information server 150 that, at block 294, updates the user information database 160 accordingly. In this way,<br>
20 the information server 150 is aware that user #1 and #2 established a connection.<br>
At this point the procedure can continue at block. 237.<br>
It is noted that actions at blocks 293 and 294 may also be omitted. In that case, the information server 150 25 becomes aware that user #2 accepted the invitation of user #1 at the receipt, at block 239, of a message from cellular phone #1 addressed to cellular phone #2.<br>
From actions 279 to 294 disclosed- with reference to figure 5, it is clear that the invention allows users 30 to perform an extended search (in terms both of covered ranges of distances and search criteria) with respect to  the  short-range  search  perfprmed- at  block  209<br><br>
WO 2007/019877<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/009008<br><br>
42<br>
(figure 2) and to establish an anonymous connection with the discovered user(s), thanks to the intermediation of the information server 150.<br>
Moreover, it is noted that actions from 279 to 286, in 5 case of SMS connection, shown in figure 5 (and clearly the steps 259-267 and 269-277 of figure 4) may also be performed in case the cellular phones involved are cellular phones 130 having reduced capability with respect to cellular phones 120 (that is, by a cellular<br>
10 phone which is unable to establish Bluetooth short-range wireless connections, to run dedicated applications and to establish packet data network connections but which has at least the capability of sending  and  receiving  SMS  or  equivalent  type  of<br>
15  messages).<br>
This allows anonymous interactions (discovery and/or chatting) between cellular phones 120 and cellular phones 130 to be performed, through the intervention of the information server 150.  For example,  it enables<br>
20 .cellular phone 130, which has not the possibility of performing a Bluetooth short-range wireless search as executed by cellular phones 120 at block 209, to discover other cellular' phone users and to chat with the   discovered   users   (if   any)   through   the<br>
25  intermediation of the information server 150.<br><br>
