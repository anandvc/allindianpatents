[Name of Document]     SPECIFICATION<br>
[Title of the Invention ]  STORAGE BATTERY PROVIDED WITH MONOBLOCK BATTERY CONTAINER<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container.<br>
[Background Art] [0002] A storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container, especially a vehicle storage battery applicable to vehicles such as an automobile, a motorcycle, etc. is generally so constructed that the inside of a battery container is divided into a plurality of cell compartments by a plurality of partition walls, and a group provided with a strap and a intermediate pole is contained in each of the cell compartments, and mutually adjacent ones of the groups are interconnectedby welding between the mutually opposite intermediate poles which are positioned face to face through the partition wall, and a pole for a positive terminal and a pole for a negative pole projecting from the respective straps of the groups positioned at both ends of the battery container are passed through a cover hermetically applied to the battery container to project to the outside of the cover to serve as a positive terminal and a negative terminal, and also a predetermined amount of electrolyte is poured into each of the cell compartments. In recent years, lightening the<br><br>
weight of the vehicle storage battery of this kind for use in vehicles has been recommended and thinning of the electrode plates has been carried out. However, on the other hand, the overall dimensions of a battery container are prescribed by the statute. Accordingly, when the group assembled by using thinned mutually opposite electrode plates and stacking them through a separator is contained in each of the cell compartments, there is produced space left between both end surfaces of the group in the stack direction of the group and the partition walls facing both the end surfaces of the group, so that it is made impossible to fixedly hold the group between the partition walls mutually facing both side surfaces of the group.<br>
In order to solve this problem, a patent reference 1 as mentioned below has proposed a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container so constructed that a recess which has a depth approximately equal to the height of the electrode plates of a group and which is opened to the outside at the bottom wall of the battery container is made between groups.<br>
Thus, according to the proposed invention as mentioned above, enlightening of the storage battery can be achieved by thinning the electrode plates of the group without changing the prescribed overall dimensions. It can be understood from the description of the specification and the drawings that the expression "the recess made open to the outside at the bottom wall" corresponds to such a concrete construction that the partition wall for<br><br>
partitioning the inside of the battery container into a plurality of cell compartments is bifurcated into double protruded partition walls which are extended vertically and downwardly and connecting to a bottom wall of the battery container and which have the height which are almost equal to the height of the electrode plates of the group contained in the cell compartment, namely, the height of the group comprising a stack of a positive plate and a negative plate and a separator interposed between these plates, and consequently, a hollow space opened to the outside is formed between the double protruded vertical walls.<br>
[Patent Reference l] JP1977(Showa 52)-108542 [problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
However, it has been found out that in a case where the storage battery is manufactured using the monoblock battery container disclosed in the foregoing patent reference 1, it has been found out that the following disadvantages are brought about.<br>
At the time of pouring a predetermined amount of electrolyte in each of the cell chambers, if it is poured rapidly, it has been observed frequently that the electrolyte leaks out to the outside of the battery, and therefore, it has to be poured gradually, and consequently, it takes a lot of time in the pouring work, and a lowering of a working efficiency is resulted.<br><br>
The cause of such disadvantages is attributed to the fact that since both end surfaces of the electrode plates of the group are held between the protruded partition walls which are approximately equal in height to the electrode plates of the group, if a predetermined amount of electrolyte is poured rapidly, the poured electrolyte is not permeated rapidly into the group, and consequently, the electrolyte is stagnated in a space above the group, and finally it tends to often leak out to the outside. Accordingly, in addition, after finish of the electrolyte pouring work, it has been observed that the electrolyte often stagnated above the group leaks out when an electric charging work is carried out immediately after the pouring work, otherwise, also in a case of loading the storage battery on a vehicle and running the vehicle, the electrolyte leaks out from a vent plug.<br>
The present invention is to solve the foregoing problems with the conventional storage battery and provide a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container free from leaking out of electrolyte. [Means for Solving Problem] [0004]<br>
The present invention as recited in claim 1, lies in a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container characterized in that the lower part of each of a plurality of partition walls partitioning the inside of a battery container into a plurality of cell compartments is bifurcated into to<br><br>
form double protruded partition walls which are extended vertically and downwardly and connect to a bottom wall of the battery container, and, on the other hand, both side surfaces of the upper part of the each partition wall are provided either with plurality of vertical ribs which are spaced apart from each other in the width direction of the partition wall and which are so protruded from both the surfaces of the partition wall as to be flush with the respective surfaces of the double protruded partition walls, and thereby each channel is formed between the mutually adjacent ones of the plural vertical ribs, and the lower parts of both end surfaces of a group contained in each of the cell compartments are held between the protruded partition walls facing them, and the upper parts of both the side surfaces of the group are held between the vertical ribs facing them.<br>
Further, the present invention as recited in claim 2, lies in a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container according to claim 1, wherein the plural vertical ribs are more protruded than the surfaces of the double protruded partition walls and further are so extended vertically and downwardly as to have vertically downward portions which are protruded from and integral with the double protruded partition walls, and thereby each channel is formed between the mutually adj acent ones of the vertically downward portions of the vertical ribs, and the lower parts of both end surfaces of a group contained<br><br>
in each of the cell compartments are held between the vertically downward portions of the vertical ribs facing them, and the upper parts of both the side surfaces of the group are held between the vertical ribs facing them.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention as recited in claim 3, lies in a storage battery provided with a monoblock battery container according to claim 1 or 2, wherein both end walls of the battery container are curved inwardly so that the wall parts thereof having almost the same in height as the height of each of the groups contained in each of the cell compartments positioned on both ends may be formed into inwardly protruded end walls, and a plurality of vertical grooves are made in the inner surfaces of the inwardly protruded end walls so as to leave at predetermined intervals in the width direction of the inwardly protruded end walls. [Effect of the Invention] [0005]<br>
According to the invention as recited in claim 1, when a group assembled by stacking a thin positive plate and a thin negative plate through a separator is contained in each cell chamber, the lower parts of the both end surfaces of the electrode plates of the group are fixedly held between the protruded partition walls facing them, and the upper parts thereof are fixedly held between the vertical ribs facing them, so that the group can be fixed without changing the prescribed outside<br><br>
dimensions of the battery container, and at the same time, a light-weight storage battery can be obtained, and, in addition, when a predetermined amount of electrolyte is poured into the intermediate cell compartment(s)positioned in the middle of the battery container, the poured electrolyte is flown downwards into the channels respectively formed between the plural vertical ribs brought in contact under pressure with both the end plate surfaces of the group, and then permeates into the group from both side surfaces thereof, so that the electrolyte never be stagnated in the space above the group, nor leaked out to the outside. As a result, leakage of electrolyte from a vent of the storage battery at the time of an electrolyte pouring work as seen in the conventional storage battery can be prevented, and pouring a predetermined amount of electrolyte can be finished rapidly and smoothly, so that an electrolyte pouring work efficiency can be improved. Further, when the electric charging is carried out immediately after the pouring work, or even in a case of loading the storage battery onto a vehicle and running the vehicle, no leakage of the electrolyte takes place.<br>
According to the invention as recited in claim 2, the lower parts of both side surfaces of the group are fixedly held between the vertically downwardportions of the vertical ribs integrated with the protruded partition walls.<br>
According to the invention as recited claim 3, not only<br><br>
each of the groups contained in each of the cell compartments positioned at both the ends of the battery container can be held between the inwardly protruded end wall and the partition wall facing the inwardly protruded end wall, but also the electrolyte poured into each of the end cell compartments positioned at the ends of the battery container can be flown downwards in'the respective grooves made in the inwardly protruded end walls brought in contact under pressure with one side surface of the group and is invaded into the group from one side surface thereof, and, meanwhile, the electrolyte is flown downwards along the respective vertical grooves formed in the inwardly protruded end wall and is invaded into the group brought in contact under pressure with the other side surface of the group from the other surface thereof.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0006] Embodiments of carrying out the present invention will be explained with reference to the attached drawings as follows. FIG. 1 shows a plan view of one embodiment of a monoblock battery container A according to the present invention. FIG. 2 denotes a side view partly in section taken along the line I-I of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 shows a bottom view thereof. FIG. 4 shows a transverse cross section view taken along the line II-II of FIG. 1. FIG. 5 shows a transverse cross section view of another embodiment of a monoblock battery container A' according to the present<br><br>
invention.<br>
In the drawings, a symbol A denotes a monoblock battery container produced by injection molding of a desired kind of synthetic resins such as polypropylene or the like. The monoblock battery container A which comprises a rectangular battery container 1 having four side walls , and five (5) partition walls<br>
3	, 3, • • • 'partitioning the inside of the battery container 1 into<br>
six (6) cell compartments 2,2, • • • • , which is the same in<br>
construction as a conventional monoblock battery container.<br>
According to the present invention, the lower part of each<br>
of the part it ion walls 3, 3, • • • *is bifurcated obliquely downwards into double protruded partition walls 3a and 3 which are extended vertically and downwardly and are connected to a bottom wall lb of the battery container 1, so that a hollow space 4 opened to the outside at the bottom wall lb is formed between the double protruded partition walls 3a and 3a. A vertical section of each protruded partition wall 3a is shaped into a wall having a vertical wall surface 3al and a downward slant wall surface 3a2, and each of the five (5) hollow spaces4,4, ••• -opened to the outside at the bottom surface lb respectively formed between each pair of the five (5) partition walls 3, 3, ••• • may be formed into a single hollow space 4 extending over an almost overall length in the width direction of the bottom wall surface, but, in order to reinforce the battery container 1, the hollow space<br>
4	is provided with a division wall lc at the middle of the width<br><br>
direction of the bottom surface and thereby it may be divided into two short hollow spaces, for instance, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
On the other hand, both side surfaces of the upper part of each of the partition walls 3,3,••••are provided with a plurality of vertical ribs 5,5,••••, for instant, six (6) vertical ribs 5,5, ••••in the illustrated embodiment, so that vertical channels 6,6, ••••are formed between the mutually adjacent ones of the plural vertical ribs 5,5,••••.<br>
In a case where it is so designed that a degree of protrusion<br>
of each of the vertical ribs 5, 5, •••'may become flush with the vertical wall surface 3al of the protruded partition wall 3a, as shown in FIG.l -FIG. 4 as one embodiment of the monoblock battery container A according to the present invention, if a group 7 constructed by stacking a thin positive plate and a negative plate through a separator is contained in each of the cell compartments 2,2, • • • •, the lower parts of both end surfaces of the group 7 are held between the protruded partition walls 3a and 3a facing them, and the upper parts of both the end surfaces of the group 7 are held between the vertical ribs 5 and 5 facing them, so that a storage battery in which the whole of each of<br>
the groups 7,7, ••••is contained stably and fast in the battery container 1. [0007] Further, otherwise, as shown in FIG. 5 as another embodiment<br><br>
the monoblock battery container A' according to the present invention, a degree of protrusion of the vertical ribs 5,5*"* may be so designed as to be more protruded than the protruded degree of the protruded vertical wall surface 3al of each of the protruded partition walls 3a,3a, • • •-and also be extended vertically downwards so that the plural ribs 5,5,"** may have vertically downward portions which are protruded from and<br>
integral with the protruded partition walls 3a, 3a,	, and<br>
thereby each channel is formed between the mutually adjacent ones of the vertically downward portions of the vertical ribs.<br>
More in detail, for example, the vertical rib 5 is so designed that the degree of protrusion thereof may be about 0.1 mm more than the vertical wall surface 3al of the protruded partition wall 3a,that is, almost flush with the vertical wall surface 3al, and also may be extended vertically downwards, so that the vertical rib 5 may have vertically downward portion which is slightly protruded from and integral with the vertical wall surf ace 3al of the protruded partition wall 3a, and as a result, the vertical rib 5 is formed into a long one reaching the bottom surface of the cell compartment as clearly shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Accordingly, when the group assembled by stacking a thin positive electrode plate and a negative electrode plate through a separator is inserted into each of the cell compartments 2,2, ••••, resistance to the insertion thereof is decreased, and in addition, the lower parts of both the end surfaces of the<br><br>
group 7 are fixedly held bet ween the vertically downward port ions<br>
of the long vertical ribs 5, 5, ••• • and 5, 5,	 mutually facing<br>
them , and the upper parts thereof are fixedly held between the vertical ribs 5,5, ••••and 5,5,%*" mutually facing them, and as a result, a storage battery in which the groups 1,1,"" are contained stably and fast in the respective cell compartments<br>
2,2,••••can be obtained. [0008] The overall height totaling the height of the protruded partition wall 3a and the height of the vertical rib 5 which is flush with the protruded partition wall 3a is so predetermined as to be higher than the height of a group which is to be contained in the cell compartment 2, and, as illustrated in the drawings, the overall height is determined to become a little higher than the height of the group 7. Here, the term "the lower part of the partition wall 3" means the height position ranging from the bottom surface of the cell compartment 2 to the level which is lower than the height of a group which is to be contained therein. This means that the upper ends of the vertical ribs 5 and 5 provided on both side surfaces of the upper part of the partition wall 3a are located at the height position which is at least almost the same level as the upper end of the group, that is, almost the same level as the upper ends of both end plates of the group 7. [0009]<br><br>
Further, both end walls la and la of the battery container 1 are curved inward so that the wall parts thereof having almost the same in height as the height of a group which is to be contained in each of the cell compartments 2 and 2 located on both ends in the battery container 1 may be formed into inwardly protruded end walls which are suitable for contacting under pressure with end surfaces of the groups. Further, as shown the drawings, vertical grooves 9,9, ••••and 9, 9, ••••are so made respectively in the inner surfaces of the inwardly protruded end walls la and la as to be extended from the upper ends of the inwardly protruded end walls to the bottom surface of the cell compartments, while leaving constant intervals between them in the width direction thereof, so that each rib 10 between the mutually adjacent ones of the vertical grooves 9, 9, • • • • is formed. Accordingly, when the group 7 is inserted into each of the cell compartments 2 and 2, both end surfaces of the group 7 are held between the protruded partition wall 3a formed at the lower part of the part it ion wall 3 located inside the inwardly<br>
protruded end wall la and the vertical ribs 5,5,'"* aligned with the side surface of the upper part thereof and the ribs<br>
10,10,•••• formed on the protruded end wall la, and also the vertical grooves 9, 9, • • • • are served as respective passages for inflow of electrolyte.<br>
[0010] Thus, when the group 7 is contained in each cell compartment<br><br>
2 of the monoblock battery container A thus constructed as above, as depicted with the chain double-dashed lines in FIG. 2, it is fixedly held between them as mentioned above, and at the same time, because each of the partition walls 3,3, • • • • partitioning the respective cell compartments 2,2,*"'* has the vertical ribs 5,5,"" so arranged on both the side surfaces of the upper part 3b thereof as to be spaced apart from each other in the width direction thereof, the passages for inflow of electrolyte are produced due to interposition of the vertical channels 6,6,•••• between both the surfaces of the group 7 contained in each of the intermediate cell compartments 2,2,2,2 and the vertical ribs 5, 5, • • • • brought in contact under pressure with them, and, at the same time, the passages for inflow of electrolyte are produced due to interposition of the vertical grooves 9, 9, ••• 'between the one side surface of both the side surfaces of each of the groups 7 and 7 contained in the end cell compartments 2 and 2 positioned at both ends of the battery<br>
container 1 and the vertical ribs 10,10, •••• in contact under pressure with the one side surface thereof.<br>
[0011] Thus, after the groups 1,1,"" are incorporated in the monoblock battery container A, in an ordinary way, intermediate poles erected respectively from a positive strap and a negative strap of the mutually adjacent groups 7 and 7 are interconnected by welding through an intercell-connecting hole 8 made in the<br><br>
upper part of each partition wall 3, and in this way, all of<br>
the groups 1,1,"" are interconnected in series to produce a storage battery, and thereafter a cover(not shown) is applied hermetically to the monoblock battery container A, and further a positive pole and a negative pole provided with the groups 7 and 7 contained in the cell compartments positioned at both ends of the battery container are passed through respective holes made in the cover to project to the outside for serving as a positive terminal and a negative terminal, and after a predetermined amount of electrolyte is poured into the respective cell compartments 2,2, •••• through electrolyte inlets made in the respective places of the cover that correspond<br>
to the respective cell compartments 2,2,'**, an electrolyte plug is applied to each of the respective electrolyte inlets, and thus production of the storage battery is finished. [0012] The above-mentioned monoblock battery container A thus constructed according to the invention brings about such advantageous effects that when a predetermined amount of electrolyte is poured into each of the cell compartments 2, 2, • • • •, each of the poured electrolytes in the intermediate cell<br>
compartments 2,2,'*'* is flowed downwards rapidly into the electrolyte inflow passages made on both the side of the group 7 and further is permeated into the group 7 from both sides thereof, and the electrolyte is not stagnated in the spaces<br><br>
above the groups, so that leakage of the electrolyte to the outside of the battery can be prevented, and also the pouring work of the predetermined amount of the electrolyte into the cell compartments can be carried out rapidly and smoothly. Accordingly, the problem of leakage of the electrolyte caused by the conventional monoblock battery container can be solved.<br>
In this case, as mentioned above, if the vertical ribs 5, 5, • • • • are so provided as mentioned as to be extended vertically and downwardly to have the vertically downward portions protruded from and integral with the vertical surface 3al of the protruded partition wall 3a, to then each vertical channel is formed between the mutually adjacent ones of the vertically downward portions, as clearly shown in FIG. 5, andas a result, electrolyte inflow passages are produced between both side surfaces of the group 7 and the vertically downward portions of the long vertical<br>
ribs 5 , 5, • • • •, and the effect of prevention of the electrolyte leakage is more improved. In addition, the electrolyte poured into each of the cell compartments positioned at both ends battery container is flown downwards into the electrolyte inflow<br>
passages produced between the vertical ribs S^*'*' arranged on the partition wall 3, and is permeated into the group 7 from one side surface thereof, so that a pouring work of a predetermined amount of electrolyte can be carried out rapidly and smoothly without stagnation of the electrolyte in the space above the group 7.  Further, even in a case of charging into<br><br>
the storage battery immediately after the pouring electrolyte work, no leakage of the electrolyte has been observed. Furthermore, even in a case of loading the storage battery onto any kind of vehicles such as an automobile, a motorcycle, or the like and running it, no leakage of electrolyte has been observed.<br>
[0013]<br>
In addition, in the foregoing monoblock battery container according to the invention, as for each of the double protruded partition walls 3a and 3a of the partition wall 3, the upper end corresponding to the bifurcated portion is shaped into a downwardly slant wall surface 3a2 directed obliquely downwards according as it is protruded towards the interior of the cell compartment 2, and also the upper end of each vertical rib 5 is shaped into a downwardly slant surface 5a directed obliquely downwards according as it is protruded towards the interior of the cell compartment 2, so that flowing the electrolyte downwards and permeating it into the group 7 can be accelerated. [0014]<br>
Furthermore, in a case where a plurality of grooves 9, 9, • • • •, five (5) grooves 9, 9, • • • •, for instance , as shown in the embodiment, are so made in each of the vertical wall surfaces of the inwardly protruded vertical end walls la and la as to leave intervals between themutually adjacent ones thereof in the widthdirection thereof, and be opened to the upper end of the inwardly protruded<br><br>
end wall la and reach the lower end thereof, and the group 7 is inserted into each of the cell chambers positioned at both ends, passages for inflow of electrolyte are advantageously<br>
produced due to interposition of the vertical grooves 9,9,•• • • between one side surface of the group 7 and the protruded end wall la brought in contact under pressure with one side surface of the group 7. Further, with this construction, there is brought about such advantageous effects that electrolyte poured into each of the cell compartments 2 and 2 positioned on both ends of the battery container 1 can be flowed deeply into the passages for inflow electrolyte, and accordingly, the electrolyte can be so permeated into the groups from the one end surface thereof facing the end wall la as to extend over the full length of the height of the group, and the pouring work of the electrolyte into the cell compartments positioned on both ends can be achieved more rapidly, and at the same time, the effect of prevention of leakage of electrolyte is more improved.<br>
[0015]<br>
Next, a more concrete example of the monoblock battery container according to the invention is explained as follows.<br>
Example<br>
The construction and specific dimensions of the structural components of themonoblockbattery container A' which was molded according to the invention is explained in detail as follows:-The height of the peripheral wall 1 of the battery container<br><br>
1 is about 70 mm, and the height of each partition wall 3 partitioning the peripheral wall 1 into the cell chambers 2,2*•• • is about 70 mm, and the five partition walls 3, 3, ••• • areprovided with trapezoidal projections which are projected upwardly about 5 mm higher than the peripheral battery wall 1 from the upper ends of the partition walls provided with intercell-connecting holes 8, 8, •••• made alternately right and left in the width direction of the every partition wall. The height of each of the protruded partition walls 3a and 3a formed at the lower part of the partition wall 3 is about 25 mm from the bottom surface of the cell compartment 2 and the height of the vertical wall surface 3al is about 20mm and the height of the slant wall surface 3a2 is about 5 mm, and the depth of the hollow space 4 opened to the outside at the bottom of the battery container 1 is about 20 mm, and the width of the opened portion thereof is about 5 mm. The height of each of the vertical ribs 5 and 5 protruded from both sides of the upper part 3b of the vertical rib 3 is about 30 mm, and out of the overall height thereof, the height of the vertical surface 5b is about 25 mm and the height of the slant surface 5a shaped obliquely at the top end thereof is about 5 mm. The protrusion degree of the vertical rib 5 from the side surface of the partition wall 3 is about 3 mm and is more protruded about 0.1 mm than the protruded partition wall 3al, and the depth of the vertical rib 5 is about 5 mm and each vertical channel 6 having a with<br><br>
of 5 mm are formed between the adjacent ones of the vertical ribs 5, 5, • • • •, in the illustrated embodiment. The height of the vertical rib 5 ranging from the bottom surface of the cell compartment 2 to the upper end of the vertical surface thereof is about 30 mm. Thus, it is so arranged that when a group 7 having a height of about 52 mm and a thickness of about 10 mm in the stack direction thereof is contained in each of the cell<br>
compartments 2,2,	, the group 7 may be pro j ected upwards about<br>
2 mm higher than the upper end of the vertical wall surface of the vertical rib 5. Further, the width spaced between the mutually opposite vertical ribs 5 and 5 inside each of the cell compartments 2,2,2,2 positioned in the middle of the battery container 1 is 5 mm, which is suitable for bringing in contact under pressure with electrode plates of both ends of the group 7 so that the group 7 contained in the cell compartment 2 may be fixedly held between the mutually opposite vertical ribs 5 and 5. Furthermore, both the end walls la and la of the battery container 1 are so protruded inwardly at the positions corresponding to the upper ends of the vertical ribs 5,5,,,,# and 5,5, •••• of the partition walls 3 and 3 respectively facing them as to form inwardly protruded end walls la and la each having an about 55 mm high vertical surface, and the inside of each of the cell compartments 2 and 2 is so constructed as to leave a space of about 10 mm between the about 50 mm high vertical wall surface of the inwardly protruded end wall la<br><br>
and the vertical ribs 5,5,*"' arranged on the partition wall 3 positioned inside and in opposite to the vertical wall surface. Further, each of the vertical grooves 9,9,,,,&gt; made in the vertical wall surface of the protruded end wall la is so formed as to have a width of about 5 mm and a depth of about 0.5 mm, and the interval between the mutually adjacent vertical grooves 9 and 9 is about 3 mm and the width of the rib 10 formed between the mutually adjacent vertical grooves 9 and 9 is about 3 mm. [0016]<br>
At the time of molding the bifurcated protruded partition walls 3a and 3a of the above-mentioned monoblock battery container A, it has been found out that if a depth of the hollow space 4 opened to the outside at the bottom of the container A is made comparatively shallow, for instance, about 20 mm, a good yield of moldings can be brought about without deforming a core section of a mold, and if the depth thereof is made about 30 mm, for instance, a length of the core section has to be longer, so that the core section is liable to be deformed, resulting in a poor yield of moldings, and accordingly, it is preferable to limit the depth thereof to about 25 mm. [0017]<br>
A lot of the groups 7,7, • • • • each comprising a stack of one thin positive plate and two thin negative plates alternately stacked each other through each separator were prepared for the monoblock battery container A' as constructed above, and<br><br>
in an ordinary way, the groups 7,7, • • • • which is to be contained in the intermediate cell compartments were assembled with straps connecting to tabs of the respective plates and intermediate poles for intercell-connection, and the groups 7, 7, • • •-which is to be contained in the end cell compartments were assembled with a pole for positive terminal and a pole for negative terminal connecting to respective straps. The respective groups thus produced were contained in the corresponding intermediate cell compartments and the end cell compartments of the monoblock battery container A', and the mutually adjacent intermediate poles were interconnected by welding through the intercell-connecting holes 8 made alternately right and left in the partition walls 3, 3, • • • •, so that all of the groups were connected in series, and a cover provided with holes for inserting the positive pole and the negative pole was applied hermetically to the monoblock battery container A, while the positive pole and the negative pole are being inserted through the respective holes and thereafter a predetermined amount of electrolyte was poured rapidly into each of the cell compartments from each of electrolyte inlets. This electrolyte pouring work could be finished rapidly without leakage of electrolyte. Finally, each of the electrolyte inlets was closed with a vent plug carrying a built-in vent hole, and a lead-acid storage battery for a two-wheeled vehicle was produced. [0018]<br><br>
Conventional Example<br>
A conventional monoblock battery container was molded and provided with the same construction and dimensions as the foregoing Example according to the invention, except such a construction that according to the conventional patent reference 1 as mentioned above, the height of the recess, in other words, the heights of the bifurcated and protruded partition walls were made about 54 mm, which have almost the same in height as the height of the group contained in the cell compartment and correspond to the height of the top end of the vertical rib 5 in Example according to the invention as mentioned above, and the end walls were formed into inwardly protruded end walls according to the invention , but the inner surfaces of the inwardly protruded end walls were formed into overall flat vertical surfaces without making the vertical grooves made in the foregoing Example according to the invention. Using the resultant monoblock battery container assembled with the groups as above, the same amount of electrolyte as that used in the foregoing Example was poured gradually and slowly in each of the cell chambers. (When it was poured at the same speed as carried out in the foregoing Example, flowing over of the electrolyte from the electrolyte inlets was often observed.) Thereafter, finally, in the same manner as the Example, a lead-acid storage battery for a two-wheeled vehicle was produced.<br><br>
[0019]<br>
Comparison Test<br>
Further, for the storage battery produced in Example and the storage battery produced in Conventional Example as mentioned above, an examination as to whether there is a leakage of electrolyte from the vent hole of the vent plug, or not was carried out in such a manner that each of them was charged with an electric current of 1 CA after leaving for five (5) minutes after pouring electrolyte into each of them. As a result, concerning the conventional storage battery, the electrolyte leakage been has observed immediately after start of charge. In contrast, concerning the storage battery of the invention, no electrolyte leakage has been observed even after lapse of 1 hour from start of charge.<br>
Furthermore, dry charged storage batteries were produced respectively using the monoblock battery containers in Conventional Example and the monoblock battery container in Example of the invention, and after pouring electrolyte, the respective dry charged storage batteries were loaded on motorcycles, and the respective motorcycles were driven across rough ground for 15 minutes. As a result, electrolyte leakage from the conventional storage battery has been observed. In contrast, the electrolyte leakage from the storage battery according to the invention has not been observed at all.<br>
As is clear from the above, a storage battery assembled<br><br>
with a monoblock battery container according to the invention is advantageous in that pouring of electrolyte into cell compartments can be achieved rapidly and also no leakage of electrolyte takes place even by carrying out the next charging immediately after the electrolyte pouring, and any subsequent works or operations, and in addition an industrial utility value of the storage battery according to the present invention for use in vehicles is very large.<br>
