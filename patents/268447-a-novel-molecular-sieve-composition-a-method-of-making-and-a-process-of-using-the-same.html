PROCESS OF USING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]       The present disclosure relates to a novel molecular sieve composition, a method of making and a process of using the same. In particular, this disclosure relates to a novel molecular sieve composition which is an EMM-10 or MCM-22 type material having low angle features of MCM-22-P and MCM-56. BACKGROUND OF THIS DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002] Molecular sieve materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Molecular sieves that find application in catalysis include any of the naturally occurring or synthetic crystalline molecular sieves. Examples of these zeolites include large pore zeolites, intermediate pore size zeolites, and small pore zeolites. These zeolites and their isotypes are described in "Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types", eds. W. H. Meier, D. H. Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, Elsevier, Fifth Edition, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference. A large pore zeolite generally has a pore size of at least about 7 A and includes LTL, VFI, MAZ, FAU, OFF, *BEA, and MOR framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of large pore zeolites include mazzite, offretite, zeolite L, VPI-5, zeolite Y, zeolite X, omega, and Beta. An intermediate pore size zeolite generally has a pore size from about 5 A to less than about 7 A and includes, for example, MFI, MEL, EUO, MTT, MFS, AEL, AFO, HEU, FER, MWW, and TON framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of intermediate pore size zeolites include ZSM-5, ZSM-11, ZSM-22, MCM-22, silicalite 1, and silicalite 2. A small pore size zeolite has a pore size from about 3 A to less than about 5.0 A and includes, for example, CHA, ERI, KFI, LEV, SOD, and LTA framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of small pore zeolites include ZK-4, ZSM-2, SAPO-34, SAPO-35, ZK-14, SAPO-42, ZK-21, ZK-22, ZK-5, ZK-20, zeolite A, chabazite, zeolite T, gmelinite, ALPO-17, and clinoptilolite.<br>
[0003] U.S. Patent No. 4,439,409 refers to a crystalline molecular sieve composition of matter named PSH-3 and its synthesis from a reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing hexamethyleneimine, an organic compound which acts as directing agent for synthesis of the MCM-56 (U.S. Patent No. 5,362,697). Hexamethyleneimine is also taught for use in synthesis of crystalline molecular sieves MCM-22 (U.S. Patent No. 4,954,325) and MCM-49 (U.S. Patent No. 5,236,575). A molecular sieve composition of matter referred to as zeolite SSZ-25 (U.S. Patent No. 4,826,667) is synthesized from a reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction<br>
containing an adamantane quaternary ammonium ion. U.S. Patent No. 6,077,498 refers to a crystalline molecular sieve composition of matter named ITQ-1 and its synthesis from a reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing one or a plurality of organic additives. [0004] Chem. Lett. Vol. 32, No. 6, page 542-543 (2003) by S. H. Lee, C. H. Shin, and S. B Hong and Microporous and Mesoporous Materials, Vol. 68, page 97-104 (2004) by S. H. Lee, C. H. Shin, D. K. Yang, S. D. Ahn, I. S. Nam and S. B Hong reported a MCM-22 molecular sieve synthesized by crystallizing reaction mixture for hydrothermal reactions prepared from water, Me6-diquat-5 dibromide, Ludox HS-40, aluminum nitrate non-hydrate, and 50 wt% sodium hydroxide solution. The mixtures had a molar composition as shown in Table I. The mixtures were crystallized under crystallization conditions (as shown in Table I) and characterized as pure phase MCM-22 with a crystal size of about 0.5 x 0.05 urn (micro plates morphology).<br>

[0038]       The MCM-22 family materials are characterized by having an X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4±0.25, 3.57±0.07 and 3.42±0.07 Angstroms (either<br>
calcined or as-synthesized). The MCM-22 family materials may also be characterized by having<br>
an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4±0.25, 6.9±0.15, 3.57±0.07 and<br>
3.42±0.07 Angstroms (either calcined or as-synthesized). The X-ray diffraction data used to<br>
characterize the molecular sieve are obtained by standard techniques using the K-alpha doublet<br>
of copper as the incident radiation and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and<br>
associated computer as the collection system. Materials belong to the MCM-22 family include<br>
MCM-22 (described in U. S. Pat. No. 4,954,325), PSH-3 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,409),<br>
SSZ-25 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,667), ERB-1  (described in European Patent No.<br>
0293032), ITQ-1 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,498), ITQ-2 (described in International Patent<br>
Publication No. WO97/17290), ITQ-30 (described in International Patent Publication No.<br>
WO2005118476), MCM-36 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,277), MCM-49 (described in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,236,575), UZM-8 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,756,030), and MCM-56 (described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,697). The entire contents of the patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0039]       It is to be appreciated the MCM-22 family molecular sieves described above are<br>
distinguished from conventional large pore zeolite alkylation catalysts, such as mordenite, in that<br>
the MCM-22 materials have 12-ring surface pockets which do not communicate with the 10-ring<br>
internal pore system of the molecular sieve.<br>
 [0040] The zeolitic materials designated by the IZA-SC as being of the MWW topology are Tnulti-layered materials which have two pore systems arising from the presence of both 10 and 12 membered rings. The Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types classes five differently named materials as having this same topology: MCM-22, ERB-1,1TQ-1, PSH-3, and SSZ-25. [0041] The MCM-22 family molecular sieves have been found to be useful in a variety of hydrocarbon conversion processes. Examples of MCM-22 family molecular sieve are MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-56, ITQ-1, PSH-3, SSZ-25, UZM-8, and ERB-1. Such molecular sieves are useful for alkylation of aromatic compounds. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,936,744 discloses a process for producing a monoalkylated aromatic compound, particularly cumene, comprising the step of contacting a polyalkylated aromatic compound with an alkylatable aromatic compound under at least partial liquid phase conditions and in the presence of a transalkylation catalyst to produce the monoalkylated aromatic compound, wherein the transalkylation catalyst comprises a mixture of at least two different crystalline molecular sieves, wherein each of the molecular sieves is selected from zeolite beta, zeolite Y, mordenite and a material having an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4±0.25, 6.9±0.15, 3.57±0.07 and 3.42±0.07 Angstroms.<br>
[0042] It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the MCM-22 family material may contain impurities, such as amorphous materials; unit cells having non-MWW framework topologies (e.g., MFI, MTW); and/or other impurities (e.g., heavy metals and/or organic hydrocarbons). Typical examples of the non-MCM-22 family molecular sieve(s) co-existing with the MCM-22 family molecular sieve(s) of this disclosure are Kenyaite, EU-1, ZSM-50, ZSM-12, ZSM-48, ZSM-5, Ferrierite, Mordenite, Sodalite, and/or Analcine. Other examples of the non-MCM-22 family molecular sieve(s) co-existing with the MCM-22 family molecular sieve(s) of this disclosure are molecular sieves having framework type of EUO, MTW, FER, MOR, SOD, ANA, and/or MFI. The MCM-22 family materials of this disclosure are preferably substantially free of non-MCM-22 family material(s). The term "substantially free of non-MCM-22 family material(s)" used herein means the MCM-22 family material of this disclosure preferably contains a minor proportion (less than 50 wt%), preferably less than 20 wt%, of non-MCM-22 family materials ("impurities") in the MCM-22 family materials, which weight percent (wt%) values are based on the combined weight of impurities and pure phase MCM-22 family materials.<br>
[0043] It is to be understood that throughout this detailed description, common characterization techniques were used to describe molecular sieve materials. These common techniques are included ascertaining:<br>
(a)	structure and the degree of crystallinity of the molecular sieve material by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD); and/or<br>
(b)	morphology and crystal size of the molecular sieve material measured by the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM); and/or<br>
(c)	chemical composition by atomic absorption spectrometry and/or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS or ICPMS);<br>
(d)	adsorption capacities and surface area measured by nitrogen BET method; and/or<br>
(e)	catalytic activities and catalytic stabilities measured by the probing reactions.<br>
X-Ray Powder Diffraction Pattern<br>
[0044]       The interplanar spacings, d's, were calculated in Angstrom units (A), and the relative<br>
intensities of the lines, I/I0, where the intensity of the strongest line above background, I0, is<br>
counted as 100, were derived with the use of a profile fitting routine (or second derivative<br>
algorithm). The intensities are uncorrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The relative<br>
intensities are given in terms of the symbols VS=very strong (greater than 60 to 100), S=strong<br>
(greater than 40 to 60), M=medium (greater than 20 to 40) and W=weak (0 to 20). It should be<br>
understood that diffraction data listed as single lines may consist of multiple overlapping lines<br>
which under certain conditions, such as differences in crystallographic changes, may appear as<br>
resolved or partially resolved lines. Typically, crystallographic changes can include minor<br>
changes in unit cell parameters and/or a change in crystal symmetry, without a change in the<br>
structure. These minor effects, including changes in relative intensities, can also occur as a result<br>
of differences in cation content, framework composition, nature and degree of pore filling, and<br>
thermal and/or hydrothermal history. Other changes in diffraction patterns can be indicative of<br>
important differences between materials, which is the case for comparing MCM-22 with similar<br>
materials, e.g., MCM-49, MCM-56, and PSH-3.<br>
[0045]       The interplanar spacings, d's, were considered broad if they exhibited peak width of<br>
about 1.5° or more at half height determined as 50 % intensity value from the maximum to the<br>
baseline.<br>
[0046]       The term "XRD distinguishable peak" as used herein is defined as XRD peak with<br>
clearly defined peak maximum, which is at least two times of the average background noise<br>
level.<br>
[0047]       The term "non-discrete" peaks (also "unresolved" peaks) in XRD as used herein<br>
means peaks having a monotonic profile in-between them (successive points either consistently<br>
increasing (or staying even) or decreasing (or staying even) within noise).<br>
[0048]       The term "discrete" peaks (also "resolved" peaks) in XRD as used herein means XRD<br>
peak(s) which are not non-discrete (unresolved).<br>
 [0049] The crystalline molecular sieve composition of this disclosure may be characterized by an X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-synthesized crystalline molecular sieve including three peaks; (1) d-spacing maximum at 12.33±0.23 Angstroms; (2) d-spacing maximum between 14.17 and 12.57Angstroms, (Table II); and (3) a non-discrete d-spacing maximum between 8.8 and 11.1 Angstroms, wherein the peak intensity of the d-spacing maximum between 14.17 and 12.57 Angstroms is less than 90% of the peak intensity of the d-spacing maximum at 12.33±0.23 Angstroms.<br>

[0051] Comparing with similar materials (MCM-22, MCM-22-P, MCM-36, MCM-49, MCM-56, EMM-10-P and EMM-10), the composition of this disclosure has three key peaks which distinguish this composition from MCM-22, MCM-22-P, MCM-36, MCM-49, MCM-56, and EMM-10 as following:<br>
(1)	peak having a d-spacing maximum at 12.33±0.23 Angstroms:<br>
all materials, MCM-22, MCM-22-P, MCM-36, MCM-49, MCM-56, EMM-10-P, EMM-10, and the composition of this disclosure;<br>
(2)	peak having a d-spacing maximum between 14.17 and 12.57Angstroms:<br>
(a) MCM-22, MCM-36, MCM-49, EMM-10 and MCM-56 do not have this peak,<br>
19-PCT<br>
(b) MCM-22-P, EMM-10-P, and this material have this peak, however for EMM-10-P, this peak is at least 90% or even higher than the peak having d-spacing maximum at 12.33±0.23 Angstroms; (3) non-discrete peak having a d-spacing maximum at between 8.66 to 11.3:<br>
(a)	similar as MCM-56, MCM-36 and EMM-10-P<br>
(b)	for all other materials, MCM-22, MCM-22-P, MCM-49 and EMM-10, this peak is a discrete peak, or partially resolved in the case of EMM-10.<br>
The differences are summarized in the following Table V:<br>

 [0054] The SEM image of a crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure made by non-germanium and non-seeding preparations are demonstrated in Figure 5. The crystalline molecular sieve as shown in Figure 5 has a crystal morphology of 5-20 micron spherical (round, oval) aggregates of intergrown platelet crystals of less than 0.1 micron thickness. The SEM images of a crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure made by germanium and/or seeding preparations are demonstrated in Figures 7, 9 and 11. The crystalline molecular sieves as shown in Figures 7, 9 and 11 have a crystal morphology of flakes with an estimated crystal size of the largest diameter less than 2 micron and an estimated thickness of about 100 nm.<br>
Surface Areas and Adsorption Uptake<br>
[0055]       The overall surface area of a molecular sieve may be measured by the Brunauer-<br>
Emmett-Teller (BET) method using adsorption-desorption of nitrogen (temperature of liquid<br>
nitrogen, 77 K). The internal surface area may be calculated using t-plot of the Brunauer-<br>
Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement. The external surface area is calculated by subtracting the<br>
internal surface area from the overall surface area measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller<br>
(BET) measurement.<br>
[0056]       The  crystalline  molecular  sieve  (after  calcination)  of this  disclosure  may  be<br>
characterized by a preferred total surface area (sum of the external and the internal surface areas,<br>
as measured by the BET method) of greater than 450 m /g, preferably greater than 475 m /g, and<br>
more preferably greater than 500 m2/g.<br>
[0057]       In addition, the crystalline molecular sieve (after calcination) of this disclosure may<br>
be characterized by the ratio of the external surface area (as measured by the t-plot of BET<br>
method) over the total surface area of preferably less than 0.18.<br>
Formulation of the Reaction Mixture for Hydrothermal Reactions<br>
[0058]       Synthetic molecular sieves are often prepared from aqueous reaction mixtures for<br>
hydrothermal   reaction   (synthesis   mixture(s)   or   synthetic   gel(s))   comprising   sources   of<br>
appropriate oxides. Organic directing agents may also be included in the reaction mixture for<br>
hydrothermal reaction for the purpose of influencing the production of a molecular sieve having<br>
the desired structure. The use of such directing agents is discussed in an article by Lok et al.<br>
entitled "The Role of Organic Molecules in Molecular Sieve Synthesis" appearing in Zeolites,<br>
Vol. 3, October, 1983, pp. 282-291.<br>
[0059]       After the components of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction are properly<br>
mixed with one  another, the reaction mixture  for hydrothermal reaction is  subjected to<br>
appropriate crystallization conditions. In some embodiments of this disclosure, such conditions<br>
usually involve heating  of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal  reaction to an elevated<br>
temperature and with stirring. Aging of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction in a ^mperature ranging from 0°C to 120°C is also desirable in some instances.

When YO2 is silica, the use of a silica source containing preferably about 30 wt% solid silica, e.g., silica sold by Degussa under the trade names Aerosil or Ultrasil (a precipitated, spray dried silica containing about 90 wt% silica), an aqueous colloidal suspension of silica, for example one sold by Grace Davison under the trade name Ludox, or HiSil (a precipitated hydrated SiO2 containing about 87 wt% silica, about 6 wt% free H2O and about 4.5 wt% bound H2O of hydration and having a particle size of about 0.02 micron) favors crystal formation from the above mixture. Preferably, therefore, the YO2, e.g., silica, source contains about 30 wt% solid YO2, e.g., silica, and more preferably about 40 wt% solid YO2, e.g., silica. The source of silicon may also be a silicate, e.g., an alkali metal silicate, or a tetraalkyl orthosilicate.<br>
[0076] In additional embodiments of this disclosure, the source of YO2 comprises acid of the tetravalent element (Y). When YO2 is silica, the silica source may be silicic acid. [0077] X is a trivalent element selected from Groups 3-13 of the Periodic Table of the Elements, such as aluminum, and/or boron, and/or iron and/or gallium, preferably aluminum. The source of X2O3, e.g., aluminum, is preferably aluminum sulphate, aluminum nitrate or hydrated alumina. Other aluminum sources include, for example, other water-soluble aluminum salts,<br>
sodium aluminate, or an alkoxide, e.g., aluminum isopropoxide, or aluminum metal, e.g., in the form of chips.<br>
[0078] The alkali or alkali earth metal element is advantageously lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium. The source of alkali or alkali earth metal element is advantageously being metal oxide, metal chloride, metal fluoride, metal sulfate, metal nitrate, or metal aluminate. The sodium source advantageously being sodium hydroxide or sodium aluminate. The alkali metal may also be replaced by ammonium (NH/) or its equivalents, e.g., alkyl-ammonium ion. [0079] The OH":YO2 molar ratio (without correction of trivalent element source) as used in this disclosure does not include correction of acid in the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction. It is calculated based on the total mole of hydroxide added to the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction divided by the total mole of Y element added to the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction. The hydroxide (OH") source is advantageously alkali metal oxide, e.g., Li2O, Na2O, K2O, Rb2O, CS2O, Fr2O, or any combination thereof; alkali metal hydroxide, e.g., LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, FrOH, or any combination thereof; ammonium hydroxide, alkali earth metal oxide, e.g., BeO, MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO, RaO, or any combination thereof; alkali earth metal hydroxide, e.g., Be(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, Ra(OH)2, or any combination thereof; oxide(s) or hydroxide(s) of any element selected from Groups 3-17, and any combination thereof; and organic hydroxide(s), such as amine hydroxide(s), hydroxide of organic template (R) used in the synthesis.<br>
[0080] The OH":YO2 molar ratio (with correction of trivalent element source) as used in this disclosure include correction of acid in the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction. The mole of OH" after correction is calculated by subtracting three times the mole of trivalent element (if the trivalent element source is supplied in the form of salt other than oxide, hydroxide, or metal) from the total mole of hydroxide added to the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction. The OH": YO2 molar ratio (with correction of trivalent element source) is, therefore, calculated based on the total mole of hydroxide after correction divided by the total mole of Y element added to the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction.<br>
[0081] Directing agent R comprises at least one of N,N,N,N'N'N'-hexamethyl-l,5-hexanediaminium (Me6-diquat-6) salt or N,N,N,N'N'N'-hexamethyl-l,5-pentanediaminium (Me6-diquat-5) salt. Examples of Me6-diquat-5 salt are hydroxide, chloride, bromide, fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, or any mixture thereof. Examples of Me6-diquat-6 salt are hydroxide, chloride, bromide, fluoride, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, or any mixture thereof. [0082] In some embodiment, the directing agent R comprises at least one of Me6-diquat-5 dibromide, Me6-diquat-5 dichloride, Me6-diquat-5 difluoride, Me6-diquat-5 diiodide, Me6-diquat-5 dihydroxide, Me6-diquat-5 sulfate, Me6-diquat-5 dinitrate, Me6-diquat-5 hydroxide bromide,<br>
Me6-diquat-5 hydroxide chloride, Me6-diquat-5 hydroxide fluoride, Me6-diquat-5 hydroxide wodide, Me6-diquat-5 hydroxide nitrate, Me6-diquat-5 fluoride bromide, Me6-diquat-5 fluoride chloride, Me6-diquat-5 fluoride iodide, Me6-diquat-5 fluoride nitrate, Me6-diquat-5 chloride bromide, Me6-diquat-5' chloride iodide, Me6-diquat-5 chloride nitrate, Me6-diquat-5 iodide bromide, Me6-diquat-5 bromide nitrate, Me6-diquat-6 dibromide, Me6-diquat-6 dichloride, Me6-diquat-6 difluoride, Me6-diquat-6 diiodide, Me6-diquat-6 dihydroxide, Me6-diquat-6 sulfate, Me6-diquat-6 dinitrate, Me6-diquat-6 hydroxide bromide, Me6-diquat-6 hydroxide chloride, Me6-diquat-6 hydroxide fluoride, Me6-diquat-6 hydroxide iodide, Me6-diquat-6 hydroxide nitrate, Me6-diquat-6 fluoride bromide, Me6-diquat-6 fluoride chloride, Me6-diquat-6 fluoride iodide, Me6-diquat-6 fluoride nitrate, Me6-diquat-6 chloride bromide, Me6-diquat-6 chloride iodide, Me6-diquat-6 chloride nitrate, Me6-diquat-6 iodide bromide, Me6-diquat-6 bromide nitrate, and any mixtures thereof.<br>
[0083] A factor affecting the cost and the product quality of the synthesis of a crystalline molecular sieve is the amount of the directing agent (represented by the R:YO2 molar ratio). The directing agent is generally the most expensive reactant(s) in the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction of many crystalline molecular sieves. The lower the amount of the directing agent in the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction (low R:YO2 molar ratio), the cheaper the final molecular sieve produced.<br>
[0084] For these embodiments as disclosed in Tables VI, VII, VIII and X, the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction may optionally contain seed crystals. It is well known that seeding a molecular sieve synthesis mixture frequently has beneficial effects, for example in controlling the particle size of the product, avoiding the need for an organic template, accelerating synthesis, and improving the proportion of product that is of the intended framework type. Usually the seeding crystals are from the synthesis similar to the one where they are used. In general any form of the crystalline material may be useful in facilitating synthesis on the new phase.<br>

[0089] In some embodiments of this disclosure, the YO2/ X2O3 molar ratio for all disclosure processes ranges from about 10 to about infinity or from about 15 to 600.

[0090] In some, embodiments of this disclosure, for these embodiments as disclosed in Tables VI, VII, VIII and X, the synthesis of the crystalline molecular sieve is facilitated by the presence of 0 to about 25 wt%, preferably about 1 to about 5 wt%, seed crystals based on total weight of tetrahedral element oxide (e.g., silica) of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction. The following seed crystals, in wt% based on total weight of tetrahedral element oxide of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction, are useful lower seed crystals wt% limits for all disclosure processes: 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15.

The seed crystals wt% ideally falls in a range between any one of the above-mentioned lower limits and any one of the above-mentioned upper limits, so long as the lower limit is less than or equal to the upper limit. The seed crystals, in wt% based on total weight of tetrahedral element oxide of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction, may be present in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 25 in one embodiment, alternatively 0.01 to 20, alternatively from 0.1 to 10, alternatively 0.5 to 10, alternatively 0.5 to 5, alternatively and from 0.1 to 5 in another embodiment.<br>
[0091] After the crystallization of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction is complete, the crystalline product may be recovered from the remainder of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction, especially the liquid contents thereof. Such recovery may involve filtering the crystals and washing these crystals with water. However, in order to remove the entire undesired residue of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction from the crystals, it is often<br>
necessary to subject the crystals to a high temperature calcination e.g., at 500°C, possibly in the presence of oxygen. Such a calcination treatment not only removes water from the crystals, but this treatment also serves to decompose and/or oxidize the residue of the organic directing agent which may be occluded in the pores of the crystals, possibly occupying ion exchange sites therein.<br>
[0092] It should be realized that the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction components can be supplied by more than one source. The reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure may vary with the nature of the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction employed and the crystallization conditions.<br>
[0093] It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the synthesis mixture having a composition within the molar ranges as discussed above means that the synthesis mixture is the product of mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture, wherein such product has a composition within the molar ranges as discussed above. The product of mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture may or may not contain individual ingredients when the synthesis mixture was prepared. The product of mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture, may even contain reaction product of individual ingredients when the synthesis mixture was prepared by mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture. Crystallization Conditions<br>
[0094] In some embodiments, when the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing neither Ge nor seed, crystallization of the crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure can be carried out under crystallization conditions comprising temperature, time of crystallization, and agitation of at least 150 rotations per minute (RPM), preferably at least 200 RPM, more preferably at least 250 RPM. In some aspects for the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing neither Ge nor seed, the crystallization may be carried out with any type of agitation, e.g., stirring or rotating the vessel about a horizontal axis (tumbling). When the crystallization is carried out under agitation, the rate of the agitation is ranged from 150 to about 10000 RPM, preferably from 200 to about 5000 RPM. In other aspects for the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing neither Ge nor seed, the crystallization conditions have the following agitation rates that are useful agitation rate limits: 110, 120, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 1000, and 5000 and the following agitation rates that are useful upper agitation rate limits: 10000, 5000, 1000, 500 and 400. The agitation rate of the crystallization conditions, for a reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing neither Ge nor seed, ideally falls in a range between any one of the above-mentioned lower limits and any one of the above-mentioned upper<br>
limits, so long as the lower limit is less than or equal to the upper limit. The agitation rate of the crystallization conditions may be present in an amount ranging from 150 to 10000 in one embodiment, alternatively 200 to 5000, alternatively from 200 to 1000, alternatively 240 to 500, alternatively 250 to 1000, alternatively and from 150 to 500 in another embodiment. [0095] In some embodiments, when the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing Ge or seed, crystallization of the crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure can be carried out under crystallization conditions comprising temperature, time of crystallization, and optionally agitation. In some aspects for the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing Ge or seed, the crystallization may be carried out at either static or stirred condition in a reactor vessel, such as for example, autoclaves. Optionally, the hydrothermal reaction is carried out with any type of agitation, e.g., stirring or rotating the vessel about a horizontal axis (tumbling). When the crystallization is carried out under agitation for the reaction mixture for hydrothermal reaction containing Ge or seed, the rate of the agitation is ranged from 1 to about 1000 RPM, preferably from 10 to about 400 RPM. In some embodiments, the crystallization conditions have the following agitation rates that are useful agitation rate limits for all disclosure processes: 1,10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 and the following agitation rates that are useful upper agitation rate limits for all disclosure processes: 100, 200, 500 and 1000. The agitation rate of the crystallization conditions ideally falls in a range between any one of the above-mentioned lower limits and any one of the above-mentioned upper limits, so long as the lower limit is less than or equal to the upper limit. The agitation rate of the crystallization conditions may be present in an amount ranging from 1 to 500 in one embodiment, alternatively 10 to 200, alternatively from 50 to 500, alternatively 20 to 500, alternatively 50 to 1000, alternatively and from 10 to 500 in another embodiment.<br>
[0096] In some embodiments, the crystallization conditions have a temperature from about 100°C to about 250°C for a time sufficient for crystallization to occur at the temperature used, e.g., from about 1 hour to about 400 hours. Preferably, the crystallization conditions have a temperature from about 140°C to about 180°C for a time sufficient for crystallization to occur at the temperature used, e.g., from about 1 hour to about 200 hours.<br>
[0097] In some embodiments of this disclosure, the crystallization conditions have the following temperatures that are useful temperature limits for all disclosure processes: 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190 and 200 and the following temperatures that are useful upper temperatures limits for all disclosure processes: 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250. The temperature of the crystallization conditions ideally falls in a range between any one of the above-mentioned lower limits and any one of the above-mentioned upper limits, so long as the lower limit is less than or equal to the upper limit. The temperature of the<br>
crystallization conditions may be present in an amount ranging from 100 to 250 in one embodiment, alternatively 100 to 200, alternatively from 140 to 200, alternatively 140 to 190, alternatively 140 to 180, alternatively and from 150 to 180 in another embodiment. [0098] Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The procedure may include an aging period, either at room temperature (~25°C) or, preferably, at a moderately elevated temperature (less than 120°C), before the hydrothermal treatment ("hydrothermal reaction") at more elevated temperature. The latter may include a period of gradual or stepwise variation in temperature.<br>
[0099] The molecular sieve product from the synthesis may further be filtrated, washed with water, and/or dried. The crystalline molecular sieve formed by crystallization may be recovered and subjected for further treatment, such as, ion-exchange with ammonium salt(s) (e.g., ammonium hydroxide, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, or any combination thereof) and/or calcination in an oxidative atmosphere (e.g., air, gas with an oxygen partial pressure of greater than 0 kPa-a) at a temperature of greater than 200°C, preferably at least 300°C, more preferably at least 400°C, and most preferably at least 500°C. Catalysis and Adsorption<br>
[00100] A summary of the molecular sieves and/or zeolites, in terms of production, modification and characterization of molecular sieves, is described in the book "Molecular Sieves - Principles of Synthesis and Identification"; (R. Szostak, Blackie Academic &amp; Professional, London, 1998, Second Edition). In addition to molecular sieves, amorphous materials, chiefly silica, aluminum silicate and aluminum oxide, have been used as adsorbents and catalyst supports. A number of long-known forming techniques, like spray drying, prilling, pelletizing and extrusion, have been and are being used to produce macrostructures in the form of, for example, spherical particles, extrudates, pellets and Tablets of both micropores and other types of porous materials for use in catalysis, adsorption and ion exchange. A summary of these techniques is described in "Catalyst Manufacture," A. B. Stiles and T. A. Koch, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1995.<br>
[00101] To the extent desired, the original metal cations of the as-synthesized material can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which tailor the catalytic activity for certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups 1-17, preferably Groups 2-12 of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
 [00102] The crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure, preferably the MCM-22 family molecular sieve, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be generally dehydrated, at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of e.g., 200°C to 595°C in an atmosphere such as air or nitrogen, and at atmospheric, sub-atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressures for e.g., between 30 minutes and 48 hours. The degree of dehydration is measured by the percentage of weight loss relative to the total weight loss of a molecular sieve sample at 595°C under flowing dry nitrogen (less than 0.001 kPa partial pressure of water vapor) for 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at room temperature (~25°C) merely by placing the silicate in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration.<br>
[00103] The crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms can be beneficially converted to another form by thermal treatment. This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 370°C for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 1000 hours. While sub-atmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 925°C. The thermal treated product is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The thermally treated product, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms, is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain organic, e.g., hydrocarbon, conversion reactions. Non-limiting examples of such reactions include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,954,325; 4,973,784; 4,992,611; 4,956,514; 4,962,250; 4,982,033; 4,962,257; 4,962,256; 4,992,606; 4,954,663; 4,992,615; 4,983,276; 4,982,040; 4,962,239; 4,968,402; 5,000,839; 5,001,296; 4,986,894; 5,001,295; 5,001,283; 5,012,033; 5,019,670; 5,019,665; 5,019,664; and 5,013,422, each incorporated herein by reference as to the description of the catalytic reactions.<br>
[00104] The crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure can be shaped into a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystals can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded. [00105] The crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure may be used as an adsorbent, such as for separating at least one component from a mixture of components in the vapor or liquid phase having differential sorption characteristics with respect to the crystalline molecular sieve(s) of this disclosure. Therefore, at least one component can be partially or substantially totally separated from a mixture of components having differential sorption characteristics with respect<br>
to the crystalline molecular sieve(s) of this disclosure by contacting the mixture with the crystalline molecular sieve(s) of this disclosure to selectively sorb the one component.

[00107]     In the case of many catalysts, it is desired to incorporate the new crystal with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and/or metal oxides such as alumina. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Use of a material in conjunction with the new crystal, i.e. combined therewith or present during synthesis of the new crystal, which is active, tends to change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes. Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction. These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions. The materials, i.e. clays, oxides, etc., function as binders for the catalyst. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength because in commercial use it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder-like materials. These clay binders have been employed normally only for the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst.<br>
 [00108] Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which families include the subbentonites, and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dictite, narcite, or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. Binders useful for compositing with the present crystal also include inorganic oxides, notably alumina.<br>
[00109] In addition to the foregoing materials, the new crystal can be composited with a porous matrix material such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, silica-titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia.<br>
[00110] The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline molecular sieve and inorganic oxide matrix vary widely, with the crystal content ranging from about 1 to about 99 percent by weight and more usually, particularly when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, in the range of about 20 to about 80 wt% of the composite.<br>

After heating for 1 hr the stirring was stopped and heating continued for another 1.5 hr under static conditions.
