				<td>COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF MAKING COMPOSITIONS EXHIBITING FUEL RESISTANCE<br>
[001]	This disclosure relates to curable compositions comprising<br>
polythioether polymers and polybasic acid-based polyepoxies, to methods of<br>
making curable compositions comprising polythioether polymers and polybasic<br>
acid-based polyepoxies, and to methods of using the curable compositions.<br>
[002]	It can be useful that cured aviation and aerospace sealants exhibit<br>
a number of properties, including adhesion upon exposure to fuel, low temperature flexibility, high temperature resistance, and impart corrosion resistance to a surface to which the sealant is applied. Providing sealants with these and other properties can be particularly challenging in aviation and aerospace applications where the chemical, thermal, and physical stress conditions can be significant.<br>
[003]	Adhesion of a sealant generally decreases upon exposure to fuels<br>
used in the aviation and aerospace industry. Compositions of the present disclosure comprising -polythioether polymers and polybasic acid-based polyepoxies can maintain adhesion to a surface when exposed to aviation fuels, impart enhanced corrosion resistance to a surface to which the composition is applied, and/or meet other aviation and aerospace performance specifications. According to certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the adhesion and corrosion resistant properties of polythioether-based compositions exhibiting low temperature flexibility can be improved by curing polythioether polymers with polybasic acid-based polyepoxies.<br>

group. In certain embodiments, a cycloalkylene group can be C3-12<br>
cycloalkylene.<br>
[011]	"Cycloalkylalkylene" refers to a divalent group derived by replacing<br>
one of the hydrogen atoms of a cycloalkyl group with an alkylene group, or<br>
derived by replacing two of the hydrogen atoms of a cyclic alkane, alkene, or<br>
alkynyl moiety with alkylene groups. In certain embodiments, a<br>
Cycloalkylalkylene group can be C4-24 Cycloalkylalkylene, e.g., the alkylene<br>
moiety of a Cycloalkylalkylene group can be a C1-12 alkylene and the<br>
cycloalkylene moiety can be a C3-12 cycloalkylene, or a C5-24 cycloalkylene can<br>

[017]	"Electron attracting groups" refers to groups to which an electron<br>
can be transferred such as -COOR groups.<br>
[018]	"Allyl" refers to the group -CH2-CH=CH2.<br>
[019]	"Epoxy" refers to compounds in which an oxygen atom is directly<br>
attached to two adjacent carbon atoms of a carbon chain or ring system, and<br>

more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection<br>
from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is<br>
not exceeded. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., =O) then two hydrogens on the<br>
atom are replaced. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are<br>
permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful<br>
synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to<br>
imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction<br>
mixture, and subsequent formulation as an agent having at least practical utility.<br>
[023]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure comprise a<br>
polythioether polymer and a polybasic acid-based polyepoxy.<br>
[024]	In certain embodiments, curable compositions of the present<br>
disclosure comprise polythioether polymers of Formula 1:<br>

In certain embodiments, X is O or S, and thus R1 is -[(-CH2)P- O -]q - (-CH2)r - or - [(CH2)P- S -]q- (-CH2)r-. In certain embodiments, p and r are equal. In certain embodiments, both p and r are 2.<br>

substituted ethylene, such as -CH2CH(CH3)-, for example, DPE polymeric<br>
blends including DPE-2 and DPE-3 (commercially available from International<br>

[033]	R4 and R5 can be derived from monoepoxies of Formula 6:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R4 can comprise a group, other than an epoxy group, that is reactive with<br>
a thiol group. In certain embodiments, R4can be derived from a -CH2-CH2-<br>

[034]	In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers useful in<br>
compositions of the present disclosure include polythioether polymers of Formula 3:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and in certain embodiments, of Formula 3(a):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
each R1 is independently chosen from C2-6-alkylene, C3-6 branched alkylene, C6-8cycloalkylene, C6-10alkylcycloalkylene, -[-(CH2)p-X-]q-(CH2)r-, and -[-(CH2)p-X-]q-(CH2)r- in which at least one -CH2- group is substituted with at least one methyl group; wherein<br>
each X is independently chosen from O, S, -NH-, and -NR3-, wherein each R3 is independently chosen from hydrogen and -CH3;<br>
p is an integer from 2 to 6; q is an integer from 1 to 5; and r is an integer from 2 to 10; each R4 is independently chosen from -CH2-CH2-, and olefins conjugated with an electron attracting group, and<br>
each R5 is independently chosen from C2-10 alkylene and C2-10 alkyleneoxy;<br>
each R2 is independently chosen from O, C2-6 alkyleneoxy, and C5-12 cycloalkyleneoxy;<br>
each R6 is independently chosen from a thiol group, a hydroxyl group, an amine group, and a vinyl group;<br>
B is a z-valent group derived from a polyfunctionalizing agent; z is an integer from 3 to 6; and<br>
n is an integer chosen to yield a number average molecular weight for the polythioether polymer ranging from 500 to 20,000 Daltons;<br>
wherein the weight ratio of the segment of Formula 2(a) to the<br>
segment of Formula 2(b) ranges from about 2:1 to 3:1.<br>
[035]	B is a z-valent group and can be derived from a compound, B',<br>
which represents a polyfunctionalizing agent. A polyfunctionalizing agent refers to a compound having more than two moieties that are reactive with -SH and/or -CH=CH2 groups. In certain embodiments, a polyfunctionalizing agent can<br>
comprise from 3 to 6 such moieties, and B is denoted as a "z-valent" group, where z represents the number of such moieties included in the agent, and hence the number of separate branches comprising the polyfunctional polythioether polymer.<br>
[036]	In certain embodiments of polythioethers of Formulae III and lll(a),<br>
the polyfunctionalizing agent is a trifunctionalizing agent wherein z is 3. In certain embodiments of polythioethers of Formulae 3 and 3(a), the functional groups of the polyfunctionalizing agent can be chosen from vinyl groups and thiol groups. Polyfunctionalizing agents having mixed functionality, i.e., polyfunctionalizing agents that include moieties, which can be different, that react with both thiol and vinyl groups can also be used. In certain embodiments, a polyfunctionalizing agent can comprise, for example, trimethylolpropane trivinylether, and the polythiols described in U.S. Patent No. 4,366,307, U.S. Patent No. 4,609,762, and U.S. Patent No. 5,225,472. In certain embodiments, a trifunctionalizing agent can be chosen from trialiylcyanurate (TAC) which is reactive with thiol groups, and 1,2,3-propanetrithiol, which is reactive with vinyl groups. In certain embodiments of polythioether polymers of Formulae 3 and 3(a), the polyfunctionalizing agent is derived from triallylisocyanurate, trialiylcyanurate, and/or combinations thereof.<br>
[037]	Mixtures of polyfunctionalizing agents comprising a range of<br>
functionalities can also be used in the preparation of polythioether polymers of Formulae 3 and 3 (a). In certain embodiments, the use of certain amounts of trifunctionalizing agents can afford polythioether polymers having average functionalities from 2.05 to 3, and in certain embodiments, from 2.1 to 2.6. Other average functionalities can be achieved by using, for example, tetrafunctional polyfunctionalizing agents, or polyfunctionalizing agents with higher valencies or mixtures thereof. The average functionality of the resulting polythioether polymer can also be affected by factors such as stoichiometry of the reactants, as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[038]	Polyfunctionalizing agents having more than three reactive<br>
moieties, i.e. z is greater than 3, afford star polymers and branched polymers. A star polymer comprises a single branch point from which predominately linear chains emanate. A branched polymer comprises a chain having a branch point intermediate between the boundary units from which predominately linear chains emanate. For example, two moles of TAC can be reacted with one mole of a dithiol to produce a polyfunctionalizing agent having an average functionality of 4. This polyfunctionalizing agent can then be reacted with a polyvinyl compound and a dithiol to yield a prepolymer, which in turn can then be reacted with a trifunctionalizing agent to afford a polythioether polymer blend having an average functionality ranging from 3 to 4.<br>
[039]	Polythioethers used in compositions of the present disclosure can<br>
exhibit a number average molecular weight ranging from 500 to 20,000 Daltons, in certain embodiments, from 2,000 to 5,000 Daltons, and in certain embodiments, from 3,000 to 4,000 Daltons.<br>
[040]	In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of the present<br>
disclosure are liquid at a temperature of 20°C (68°F) or less.  In certain<br>
embodiments, polythioether polymers of the invention are liquid at a<br>
temperature of 4°C (40°F) or less and in certain embodiments, are liquid at a<br>
temperature of 4°C (40°F) or less for at least one month. In certain<br>
embodiments, polythioether polymers of the present disclosure exhibit a<br>
viscosity ranging from 75 poise to 150 poise at a temperature of 20°C and a<br>
viscosity ranging from 300 poise to 380 poise at a temperature of 4°C. In<br>
comparison, polythioether polymers formed using diepoxides such as disclosed<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 6,486,297 exhibit a viscosity ranging from 400 poise to 450<br>
poise at a temperature of 20°C and are solid at a temperature of 4°C.<br>
[041]	In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of the present<br>
disclosure exhibit a viscosity of less than 200 poise at a temperature of 25°C and a pressure of 760 mm Hg as determined according to ASTM D-2849 §79-90 using a Brookfield viscometer. In certain embodiments, polythioether<br>
polymers of the present disclosure exhibit a viscosity of 400 poise or less at a temperature of 4°C.<br>
[042]	In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers of the present<br>
disclosure exhibit a glass transition temperature Tg of -50°C or less, in certain embodiments, -55°C or less, and in certain embodiments, -60°C or less. Low Tg is indicative of good low temperature flexibility, which can be determined by known methods, for example, by the methods described in AMS (Aerospace Material Specification) 3267 §4.5.4.7, MIL-S (Military Specification) -8802E §3.3.12 and MIL-S-29574, and by methods similar to those described in ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) D522-88. The glass transition temperature of polythioether polymers of the present disclosure can be measured by differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
[043]	Methods of preparing polythioether polymers of Formula I are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2004/0247792 A1.<br>
[044]	Polythioether polymers useful in curable compositions of the<br>
present disclosure of Formula 1 can be formed by the process of reacting a first polythiol with a compound comprising one epoxy group and a second group, other than an epoxy group, which is reactive with at thiol group to form a first prepolymer, wherein the a polythiol preferentially reacts with the second group; reacting the first prepolymer and a second polythiol with the epoxy group of the first polythiol to form a second prepolymer; and reacting the second prepolymer and a third polythiol with a polyvinyl ether. In certain embodiments, the second and third polythiols comprise un-reacted a first polythiol. In certain embodiments, the first polythiol, second polythiol, and third polythiol are the same polythiols.<br>
[045]	In a first step, a polythiol can be reacted with a monoepoxy<br>
comprising one epoxy group and a second group, other than an epoxy group, that is reactive with a thiol group to form a first prepolymer. The reaction conditions are established such that the polythiol preferentially reacts with the second group, or the non-epoxy group, of the monoepoxy. In the first step, a<br>
thiol group can add across double bonds of the second, non-epoxy group, such<br>
as a vinyl group, to form the first prepolymer. The first prepolymer can be the<br>
1:1 addition product of the polythiol and the monoepoxide, and comprises an<br>
epoxy group and a thiol group. Following the first reaction step, the reaction<br>
mixture comprises the first prepolymer and un-reacted polythiol.<br>
[046]	In certain embodiments, a polythiol and monoepoxide can be reacted<br>
at a temperature of 70°C for 1 hour. In certain embodiments, a polythiol can be<br>
present in an amount ranging from 40 to 80 mole percent, and in certain<br>
embodiments from 50 to 60 mole percent. In certain embodiments, a monoepoxide<br>
is present in an amount ranging from 5 to 25 mole percent, and in certain<br>
embodiments from 10 to 15 mole percent. Mole percent is based on total moles of<br>
reactants used in forming the polythioether polymer.<br>
[047]	A polythiol can comprise any compound, polymer, or monomer<br>
having at least two thiol groups, and can include any of the polythiols disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, a polythiol can be a dithiol. In certain embodiments, a polythiol can comprise a mixture of polythiols. In certain embodiments, a polythiol can comprise dimercaptodioxaoctane and/or dimercaptodiethylsulfide.<br>
[048]	In certain embodiments, a group that is reactive with a thiol group,<br>
other than an epoxy group, can be a vinyl group. In certain embodiments, the<br>
compound containing one epoxy group and a group that is reactive with a thiol<br>
group, other than an epoxy group, used in the preparation of polythioethers of<br>
Formula 1 can be allyl glycidyl ether. Other useful monoepoxides include, for<br>
example, glycidyl acrylate, and/or glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
[049]	In a second reaction step, the first prepolymer and un-reacted<br>
polythiol remaining from the first reaction step can be reacted with the epoxy group of the first prepolymer, optionally in the presence of a catalyst, to form a second prepolymer. The second reaction step comprises the ring opening of the epoxy groups by un-reacted thiol groups. In the second reaction step, thioi groups on both the first prepolymer and un-reacted polythiols participate in the<br>
ring opening of the epoxy groups to form the second prepolymer. After the completion of the second reaction step, the reaction mixture comprises higher molecular weight polythiols as the second prepolymer, and un-reacted starting poiythiols.<br>
[050]	In certain embodiments, the optional catalyst comprises a basic<br>
catalyst such as, for example, triethylamine (TEA), 1,4-diazabicylco[2.2.2]octane<br>
(DABCO), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), pyridine, and/or<br>
substituted pyridine. In certain embodiments, the second reaction step is<br>
carried out at a temperature ranging from 20°C to 80°C for 2 to 6 hours.<br>
[051]	In a third reaction step, a polyvinyl compound can be reacted with<br>
the second prepolymer and un-reacted polythiol. The third reaction step comprises the free radical-catalyzed addition of thiol groups of both the second prepolymer and remaining un-reacted starting polythiol across the double bonds of a polyunsaturated compound such as a polyvinyl compound. In certain embodiments, a polyvinyl compound can be a polyvinyl ether, and in certain embodiments, can be a divinyl ether.<br>
[052]	A polyvinyl ether can be any of the polyvinyl ethers disclosed<br>
herein. In certain embodiments, a polyvinyl ether used in the preparation of the polythioethers of Formula 1 can be diethylene glycol divinyl ether. In certain embodiments, the polyvinyl compound can be chosen from allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, and vinylcyclohexene. In certain embodiments, a polyvinyl ether can be present in an amount ranging from 5 to 25 mole percent, and in certain embodiments, from 10 to 20 mole percent, with the mole percent based on the total moles of reactants. The total amount of polyvinyi ether can be added to the reaction mixture at intervals during a 1 hour time period. After the addition reaction has proceeded to near completion, a free radical initiator such as VAZO 67 (2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) (commercially available from DuPont) in an amount ranging from 0.001% by weight to 0.10% by weight of the polyvinyl ether can be added to complete the reaction.<br>
[053]	In certain embodiments, the catalyst used in the third reaction step<br>
can comprise a free-radical catalyst. In certain embodiments, the free-radical catalyst used in the preparation of polythioether polymers of Formula 1 can be chosen from azo(bis)isobutyronitrile (AIBN), and organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, and t-butyl peroxide.<br>
[054]	In certain embodiments, the third reaction step is carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from 60°C to 80°C for 6 to 24 hours.<br>
[055]	In certain embodiments, branched polythioether polymers of the<br>
present disclosure having the structure of Formulae 3 and 3(a) useful in compositions of the present disclosure can be formed by the process of reacting a first polythiol with a compound comprising one epoxy group and a second group, other than an epoxy group, which is reactive with at thiol group to form a first prepolymer, wherein the polythiol preferentially reacts with the second group, reacting the first prepolymer and a second polythiol with the epoxy group of the first prepolymer to form a second prepolymer, and reacting the second prepolymer and a third polythiol with a polyvinyl ether and a polyfunctionalizing agent. In certain embodiments, the second and third polythiols comprise un-reacted first polythiol. In certain embodiments, the first polythiol, second polythiol, and third polythiol are the same polythiols.<br>
[056]	To prepare branched polythioether polymers, a polyfunctionalizing<br>
agent is included in the third reaction step. The polyfunctionalizing agent can be any of those disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the polyfunctionalizing agent can be trifunctional, and more specifically, the polyfunctionalizing agent is triallylcyanurate (TAC). In certain embodiments, the trifunctionalizing agent can be present in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 4 mole percent, and in certain embodiments, from 1 to 3 mole percent. Use of polyfunctionalizing agents produces a polythioether polymer having a functionality greater than 2. In certain embodiments, polythioether polymers formed by the processes disclosed herein have an average functionality ranging from 2.05 to 3, and in certain embodiments, ranging from 2 to 2.4.<br>
[057]	Since the reaction of a polyvinyl compound with a polythiol is an<br>
addition reaction, the reaction can proceed substantially to completion, i.e. no or<br>
substantially no undesirable by-products are produced. For example, the<br>
process of forming polythioether polymers of the present disclosure does not<br>
produce appreciable amounts of malodorous cyclic by-products. Moreover,<br>
polythioether polymers prepared according to the processes of the present<br>
disclosure are typically substantially free of residual catalyst.<br>
[058]	In certain embodiments, capped analogs of polythioether polymers<br>
of Formulae 1 and 3(a) can be prepared by further reacting a compound of Formula 7:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [059]	Compounds of Formula 7 are alkyl w-alkenyl ethers having a<br>
terminal ethylenically unsaturated group that can react with terminal thiol groups to cap the polythioether polymer.<br>
[060]	In Formula 7, s is an integer from 0 to 10, such as 0 to 6, or 0 to 4,<br>
and R5 is an un-substituted or substituted alkylene group, such as a C1-6n-alkylene group which can be substituted with at least one -OH or -NHR7 group, where R7 is chosen from hydrogen and C1-6 alkylene. Examples of useful R5 groups include alkylene groups, such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene; hydroxyl-substituted alkylene groups such as 4-hydroxybutylene; and, amine substituted groups such as 3-aminopropylene.<br>
[061]	Compounds of Formula 7 where S is 0 are monovinyl ethers and<br>
include, for example, amino- and hydroxyalkyl-vinyl ethers, such as<br>
3-aminopropyl vinyl ether and 4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether (butanediol monovinyl<br>
ether), and un-substituted alkyl vinyl ethers such as ethyl vinyl ether.<br>
Compounds of Formula 7 where S is 1 include allyl ethers, such as<br>
4-aminobutyl allyl ether and 3-hydroxypropyl allyl ether.<br>
[062]	Use of equivalent amounts of compounds of Formula 7 relative to<br>
thiol groups present in Formulae 1 and 3 provides fully capped polythioether<br>
polymers, while use of lesser amounts results in partially capped polythioether polymers.<br>
[063]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure comprise a<br>
polybasic acid-based epoxy. Polybasic acid-based epoxies can be prepared by reacting a polybasic acid with an epoxy resin having at least two epoxy groups. Polybasic acids are generally viscous liquids produced by the oligomerization of saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids. The carbon atoms of the constituent fatty acid chains can be linked together in a variety of ways to produce different structural types such as cyclic, monocyciic, bicyclic, and aromatic polybasic acids. Furthermore, within each type there can be many structural isomers. The distribution of the structural types and isomers can depend, for example, on the degree of the saturation of the starting fatty acid monomers and the process conditions employed for oligomerization. Examples of saturated fatty acids include hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, tetracosanoic acid, and the like. Examples of mono-unsaturated fatty acids include hexandecenoic acid, octadecenoic acid, and cis-tetracosenoic acid, and the like. Examples of polyunsaturated fatty acids include hexandecadienoic acid, octadecadienoic acid, and the like. A fatty acid monomer can be for example, a C4-60 fatty acid, which can have any degree of saturation. In certain embodiments, polybasic acid-based epoxies of the present disclosure can be derived from a C18 fatty acid.<br>
[064]	Polybasic acids useful in polybasic acid-based epoxies of the<br>
present disclosure include monobasic acids, dibasic acids, also referred to herein as dimer acids, tribasic acids, and/or polybasic acids having higher functionality. Polybasic acids can be derived from one or more fatty acid monomers. For example, polybasic acids can be prepared by the oligomerization of a C18 fatty acid and a C22fatty acid to produce a C40 dibasic acid, or from two C18 fatty acids to produce a C36 dibasic acid. Polybasic acids useful for forming polybasic acid-based epoxies of the present disclosure can include mixtures of polybasic acids. In certain embodiments, useful polybasic<br>
acids are dibasic acids, also referred to as dimer acids. In certain embodiments, a dimer acid based polyepoxy can be derived from a C1-60 fatty acid monomer, and in certain embodiments, from a C20-40 fatty acid monomer. Dimer acids are commercially available from sources such as Cognis (EMPOL), Arizona Chemical (CENTURY, SYLVABLEND, and UNIDYME), and Uniquema (PRIPOL).<br>
[065]	Polybasic acid-based epoxies can be prepared by reacting a<br>
polybasic acid with a polyepoxy. A polyepoxy incorporates two or more epoxy groups. Any appropriate polyepoxy can be used. In certain embodiments, the polyepoxy can have two epoxy groups, three epoxy groups, or more than three epoxy groups. The polyepoxy can comprise a single type of polyepoxy or a mixture of polyepoxies. In certain embodiments, the polyepoxy can comprise a polyepoxide, such as a diepoxide where an epoxide refers to a subgenus of epoxies containing a saturated, three-membered cyclic ether having the structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [066]	Examples of useful diepoxides include hydantoin diepoxide,<br>
diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol-A such as EPON 828 (commercially available from Resolution Performance Products, LLC), diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol-F, Novalak type epoxides such as DEN-431 (commercially available from Dow Plastics), and epoxidized unsaturated phenolic resins, acrylic polyol esters, methacrylic polyol esters, and trialiylcyanurate. The stoichiometry of the acid groups of a polybasic acid and the epoxy groups of the epoxy can be selected to produce a polybasic acid-based epoxy having terminal epoxy groups capable of reacting with the terminal functional groups of a polythioether. For example, one mole of a polythioether of Formula 1 can be reacted with 2 moles of a diepoxide, and one mole of a trifunctional polythioether of Formula 3 can be reacted with 6 moles of a diepoxide. Any appropriate reaction method can be<br>
used to form a polybasic acid-based epoxy, for example, a polybasic acid-based epoxy can be produced by reacting a polybasic acid and a polyepoxy in the presence of a phenyl phosphine catalyst at a temperature ranging from 110°C to 120°C. Examples of commercially available polybasic acid-based epoxies include HYPOX DA323 (Specialty Chemicals, Inc.), EPOTUF (Reichhold), and HELOXY (Resolution Performance Products).<br>
[067]	Polybasic acid based epoxies comprise a hydrophobic backbone.<br>
Hydrophobicity of the backbone can impart enhanced adhesion and corrosion resistance to cured compositions comprising polybasic acid-based epoxies. The increased hydrophobicity can reduce the permeation of gases and/or moisture through the cured sealant and can reduce the mobility of ions at the interface between the sealant and the surface to which the sealant is applied. Both attributes can result in enhanced corrosion resistance. Therefore, in certain embodiments, useful polybasic acid-based epoxies can comprise a hydrophobic backbone. Examples of oligomers characterized by hydrophobic backbones include, for example, fatty acids, lipids, polyacrylates, alkylenes, aikyl-substituted ethyleneimines, alkyl acrylamid.es, styrenes, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, and/or vinyl halides.<br>
[068]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure can be useful as<br>

A polythioether having a certain chemical formula generally represents a distribution of polythioether polymers having a number average molecular weight wherein polythioethers within the distribution can reflect differences in<br>
the number of constituent repeat units and/or differences in the chemical composition of the constituent units. A polythioether as used herein is intended to represent a polythioether within the molecular weight distribution.

For example, in certain embodiments, a surface can be solvent wiped using a lint free fabric retaining a volatile solvent such as ethanol, methanol, naptha, mineral spirits, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, and/or other suitable solvents. In certain embodiments, a commercially available cleaning solvent such as DESOCLEAN 120 (commercially available from PRC-DeSoto International, Inc.) can be used.<br>
[092]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure can be applied to a<br>
surface by any means known to those skilled in the art and as appropriate for a particular application including extruding, pressing, grouting, caulking, spreading, and the like.<br>
[093]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure can be cured<br>
according to recommended procedures as can be determined by one skilled in<br>
the art and, in certain embodiments, at ambient temperature. In certain<br>
embodiments, curable compositions are curable at a minimum temperature of<br>
0°C, in certain embodiments, at a minimum temperature of -10°C, and in certain<br>
embodiments at a minimum temperature of -20°C. By curable is meant capable<br>
of undergoing one or more chemical reactions to form stable, covalent bonds<br>
among at least some of the constituent compounds of the curable composition,<br>
for example, between a polythioether and a polybasic acid-based epoxy. For<br>
example, for a curable composition comprising a polythioether and a polybasic<br>
acid-based polyepoxy, during the curing process the reactive groups of a<br>
polythioether will react with the epoxy groups to form covalent bonds.<br>
[094]	The integrity, moisture resistance, and fuel resistance of the seal<br>
resulting from application of curable compositions of the present disclosure can be evaluated by performing, for example, the tests identified in specification AMS 3265B. An acceptable seal will be tight and resistant to moisture and aircraft fuel.<br>
[095]	When cured, curable compositions of the present disclosure exhibit<br>
properties advantageous for use in sealants when exposure to fuel is anticipated, such as, for example, in certain aviation and aerospace applications. In general, it is desirable that sealants used in aviation and aerospace applications exhibit the following properties: peel strength greater than 20 pounds per linear inch (pli) on Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 3265B substrates determined under dry conditions, following immersion in JRF for 7 days, and following immersion in a solution of 3% NaCl according to AMS 3265B test specifications; tensile strength between 300 pounds per square inch<br>
(psi) and 400 psi; tear strength greater than 50 pounds per linear inch (pli);<br>
elongation between 250% and 300%; and hardness greater than 40 Durometer<br>
A. These and other cured sealant properties appropriate for aviation and<br>
aerospace applications are disclosed in AMS 3265B, the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. It is also desirable that when cured, curable<br>
compositions of the present disclosure used in aviation and aircraft applications<br>
exhibit a percent volume swell not greater than 25% following immersion for one<br>
week at 60°C (140°F) and ambient pressure in JRF type 1. Other properties,<br>
ranges, and/or thresholds may be appropriate for other sealant applications.<br>
[096]	The time to form a viable seal using curable compositions of the<br>
present disclosure can depend on several factors as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, and as defined by the requirements of applicable standards and specifications.  In general, curable compositions of the present disclosure develop adhesion strength within 24 hours to 30 hours, and 90% of full adhesion strength develops from 2 days to 3 days, following mixing and application to a surface. In general, full adhesion strength as well as other properties of cured compositions of the present disclosure becomes fully developed within 7 days following mixing and application of a curable composition to a surface.<br>
[097]	When cured, curable compositions of the present disclosure exhibit<br>
fuel resistance. A measure of fuel resistance Is the percent volume swell following prolonged exposure of a cured composition of the present disclosure to a hydrocarbon fuel, which can be quantitatively determined using methods similar to those described in ASTM D792, AMS 3269, or AMS 3265B. Thus, in certain embodiments, when cured, curable compositions of the present disclosure exhibit a percent volume swell of 25% or less following immersion for one week at 60°C (140°F) and ambient pressure in jet reference fluid (JRF) type 1, and in certain embodiments, a percent volume swell of 20% or less, In certain embodiments, the percent volume swell of the cured, curable compositions is 20% or less. JRF type 1, as employed herein for determination<br>
of fuel resistance, has the following composition (see AMS 2629, issued July 1, 1989), section 3.1.1 et seq., available from SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers, Warrendale, Pennsylvania): 28 ± 1 % by volume toluene, 34 ± 1 % by volume cyclohexane, 38 ± 1 % by volume isooctane, 1 ± 0.005% by volume tertiary dibutyl disulfide, and 0.015% ±0.0015 by weight of the other four components including tertiary butyl mercaptan.<br>
[098]	Depending on a particular formulation, curable compositions of the<br>
present disclosure can exhibit initial extrusion rates as high as 500 g/min or higher, together with low extrusion rates ranging from 5 g/min to 10 g/min or less one hour following mixing.<br>
[099]	Curable compositions of the present disclosure can exhibit a Tg<br>
when cured of -55°C or less, in certain embodiments, -60°C or less, and in<br>
certain embodiments -65°C or less. The glass transition temperature, Tg, can<br>
be measured by differential scanning calorimetry.<br>
[0100]	In certain embodiments, curable compositions of the present<br>
disclosure exhibit a peel strength greater than 20 pounds per square inch as determined according to AMS 3265B. In certain embodiments, curable compositions of the present disclosure exhibit enhanced corrosion resistance compared to curable compositions formulated without polybasic acid-based epoxies.
