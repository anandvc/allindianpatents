				<td>Light permeable heat protection element with aluminate-<br>
modified or borate-modified silicon dioxide<br>
The invention relates to a transparent heat protection<br>
element having at least one support element and at<br>
least one protective layer comprising a reaction<br>
product containing aqueous alkali metal silicate<br>
solution and aluminate- or borate-modified silicon<br>
dioxide and also a process for producing it.<br>
DE-A 2 414 575 describes fire-shielding glass panes<br>
containing a fire-resistant layer comprising a polymer<br>
membrane which on at least one side has a layer<br>
containing a barrier-forming material. This material<br>
may be an aluminate or an alkali metal silicate. The<br>
purpose of this material is to make the layer(s) more<br>
opaque to infrared radiation on heating, since this<br>
material forms thermally insulating barriers.<br>
US 4,190,698 describes transparent fire protection<br>
panes containing at least one dried layer comprising<br>
hydrated alkali metal silicates and one or more<br>
auxiliaries such as urea, polyhyriric alcohols,<br>
colloidal silica or sodium aluminate. When colloidal<br>
silica and sodium aluminate are used, a modulus of less<br>
than 4 is achieved. The purpose of the addition of the<br>
auxiliaries is to improve the resistance of the layer<br>
and thus the fire protection pane in the case of fire.<br>
A disadvantage in the production of these fire<br>
protection panes is that evaporation of water from the<br>
original formulation is necessary, which is complicated<br>
from a production engineering point of view. The dried<br>
fire protection layer is formed by casting onto an open<br>
surface and subsequent drying and cannot be formed in<br>
closed hollow spaces. It is also known that the<br>
addition of sodium aluminate to the protective layer<br>
leads to precipitates and thus, as a further<br>
disadvantage, to the protective layer rapidly becoming<br>
cloudy.<br>
WO-A 2004/014813 describes the production of heat protection<br>
elements based on a solution comprising water glass and an<br>
aluminate, with the aluminate having to be partially<br>
neutralized using organic acids such as citric acid before<br>
addition to the silicate solution. If partial neutralization of<br>
the aluminate is not carried out, a stable solution of water<br>
glass and aluminate is not obtained. A disadvantage in the<br>
production of these heat protection elements is that<br>
evaporation of water from the original formulation for the heat<br>
protection elements is necessary, which is complicated in terms<br>
of production engineering.<br>
WO-A 94/04355 describes the production of a transparent heat<br>
protection element having at least one support element and a<br>
protective layer composed of water-containing alkali metal<br>
silicate. Such transparent heat protection elements are<br>
employed, for example, for the production of fire protection<br>
glasses. A significant constituent of the heat protection<br>
elements is the protective layer of water-containing alkali<br>
metal silicate which is produced by reaction of an alkali metal<br>
silicate and a silica aqua sol in such a mixing ratio that the<br>
molar ratio of silicon dioxide to the total amount of alkali<br>
metal oxide, known as the modulus, is greater than 4:1. The<br>
silica sol component is in this case used as hardener for the<br>
alkali metal silicate. Curing by means of silica sols enables<br>
the evaporation of water from the original formulation of the<br>
layer, which is necessary in other known protective layers and<br>
is complicated in terms of production engineering, to be<br>
dispensed with.<br>
However, a disadvantage of protective layers composed of water-<br>
containing alkali metal silicate and silica sol as hardener, as<br>
described in WO-A 94/04355, is their tendency to become cloudy<br>
35during use. This applies particularly in the case of prolonged<br>
exposure to temperatures above 20°C, which can be prolonged<br>
during the summer months and can accelerate the clouding<br>
process.<br>
Electron micrographs confirm that the clouding of the aqueous<br>
alkali metal silicate protective layer is caused by a<br>
crystallization process. The additions of oxides of the<br>
elements of main group III of the Periodic Table, in particular<br>
boron oxide or aluminum oxide, are known to promote<br>
crystallization processes in glasses and should accordingly be<br>
expected to accelerate the clouding of glasses.<br>
There is therefore a need for transparent heat protection<br>
elements and also materials for use as protective layer in such<br>
heat protection elements, which have a high transparency and<br>
aging resistance. In addition, the starting composition for the<br>
protective layer should be flowable and be suitable for casting<br>
into hollow spaces and subsequently harden over an appropriate<br>
period of time to form the protective layer.<br>
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide<br>
such heat protection elements and also materials for use as<br>
protective layer in these heat protection elements.<br>
This object has surprisingly been achieved by the protective<br>
layer comprising a reaction product containing aqueous alkali<br>
metal silicate solution and aluminate- or borate-modified<br>
silicon dioxide, with this reaction product having a modulus of<br>
from 4 to 7. An addition of organic acids as described in<br>
WO-A 2004/014813 is not necessary here.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides a transparent heat<br>
protection element having at least one support element and at<br>
least one protective layer comprising a reaction product<br>
containing aqueous alkali metal silicate solution and<br>
aluminate- or borate-modif ied silicon dioxide, characterized in<br>
that the reaction product has a modulus of from 4 to 7.<br>
As aqueous alkali metal silicate solution, it is possible to<br>
use water glass, preferably potassium water glass.<br>
The silicon dioxide which is suitable for the purposes of the<br>
invention can, for example, be introduced in the form of<br>
precipitated silicon dioxide, silica gel, pyrogenic silicon<br>
dioxide or silica sols into the protective layers or be<br>
produced therefrom. Preference is given to using pyrogenic<br>
silicon dioxide or silica sols, particularly preferably silica<br>
sols. The water-containing silicon dioxide is preferably<br>
produced from stable suspensions, sols or gels or colloidal or<br>
colloidally disperse solutions, for example silica sols, of<br>
such forms of silicon dioxide. Silica sols and their production<br>
are known to those skilled in the art. Silica sols are<br>
commercially available; mention may here be made by way of<br>
example of the products obtainable under the trade name Levasil<br>
from H. C. Starck GmbH.<br>
Silica sols are colloidal solutions of amorphous silicon<br>
dioxide in water, which are also referred to as silicon dioxide<br>
sols but usually as silica sols for short. In these, the<br>
silicon dioxide is present in the form of spherical particles<br>
which are hydroxylated on the surface. The particle diameter of<br>
the colloidal particles is generally from 1 to 200 nm, with the<br>
specific BET surface area (determined by the method of G. N.<br>
Sears, Analytical Chemistry Vol. 28, No. 12, 1981-1983,<br>
December 1956), which correlates with the particle size, being<br>
from 15 to 2000 m2/g. The surface of the SiO2 particles has a<br>
charge which is compensated by an appropriate counterion,<br>
leading to stabilization of the colloidal solution.<br>
Silica sols which are suitable for the purposes of the<br>
invention have a pH of from 7 to 11.5 and contain, for example,<br>
small amounts of Na2O, K2O, Li2O, ammonia, organic nitrogen<br>
bases, tetraalkylammonium hydroxides or alkali metal aluminates<br>
or ammonium aluminates as alkalizing agent. The pH values<br>
quoted are, unless indicated otherwise, pH values determined at<br>
25°C. The solids concentrations of suitable silica sols are<br>
preferably from 5 to 60% by weight of SiO2.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, aluminate-modified silicon<br>
dioxide, in particular aluminate-modified silica sol, can be<br>
prepared, for example, by addition of a suitable amount of<br>
aluminate ions, Al(OH)4-, to silicon dioxide with stirring. The<br>
solution of aluminate ions is appropriately a dilute sodium<br>
aluminate or potassium aluminate solution. The silicon dioxide<br>
particles appropriately have from about 0.05 to about 2,<br>
preferably from about 0.1 to about 2, Al+ atoms/nm2 of surface<br>
area of the silicon dioxide particles. The aluminate-modified<br>
silicon dioxide particles comprise inserted or exchanged<br>
aluminate ions, producing aluminosilicate sites having a fixed<br>
negative surface charge. The aluminate-modified silicon dioxide<br>
particles retain their high negative surface charge up to a pH<br>
of 3, in contrast to conventional unmodified silicon dioxide.<br>
In the case of unmodified silicon dioxide, the negative surface<br>
charge decreases when the pH is reduced, normally to a pH of<br>
about 2, which represents the zero-charge point for unmodified<br>
silicon dioxide. Thus, the surface charge for unmodified<br>
silicon dioxide particles at a pH below about 8 is smaller than<br>
for aluminate-modified silicon dioxide. The pH of the<br>
aluminate-modified silicon dioxide can appropriately be set to<br>
a pH in the range from 3 to 11, preferably from about 4 to 10,<br>
preferably by means of an ion-exchange resin. The aluminate-<br>
modified silicon dioxide can then be concentrated so that it<br>
has a silicon dioxide content of from about 1 to 60% by weight.<br>
The process for preparing the aluminate-modified silicon<br>
dioxide is also described in "The Chemistry of Silica" by Ralph<br>
K. Ilcr, pp. 407-409, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1979 and in US<br>
5,368,833.<br>
An analogous production process can be employed for borate-<br>
modified silicon dioxide, in particular borate-modified silica<br>
sol.<br>
The production of aluminate- or borate-modified silica sols<br>
comprises carrying out essentially the production steps of<br>
dealkylation of water glass by means of ion exchange, setting<br>
and stabilization of the desired particle size (distribution)<br>
of the SiO2 particles, setting of the desired SiO2 concentration<br>
and aluminate- or borate-modification of the SiO; particles. In<br>
none of these steps do the SiO2 particles leave the colloidally<br>
dissolved state. This explains the presence of the discrete<br>
primary particles.<br>
The aluminate- or borate-modified silicon dioxide preferably<br>
has an aluminate or borate content of from 0.01 to 1.5% by<br>
weight, particularly preferably from 0.05 to 1.0% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of SiO2 in the unmodified silicon<br>
dioxide.<br>
The term modulus is known. To a person skilled in the art, the<br>
modulus of a siliceous binder is the molar ratio, which can be<br>
determined by analysis, of silicon dioxide (SiO2) and alkali<br>
metal oxide M2O (M = boron, lithium, sodium or potassium) in the<br>
solid of the binder.<br>
The aluminate- or borate-modified silicon dioxide preferably<br>
has a modulus of from 4.2 to 6.5.<br>
The reaction product can preferably additionally contain an<br>
agent for lowering the freezing point; the agent for lowering<br>
the freezing point can be a monofunctional and/or<br>
polyfunctional alcohol selected from the . group consisting of<br>
glycerol, glycol, sugar, diethylene glycol and polyethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
The heat protection element of the invention is preferably a<br>
fire protection composite glass.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
protective layer(s) is/are in each case located between at<br>
least two support elements. Sandwich structures having a<br>
protective layer between two support elements or else multiple<br>
sandwich structures having an alternating sequence of support<br>
elements and protective layers can be obtained in this way.<br>
Support elements are preferably present on the outside.<br>
Suitable support elements for the transparent heat protection<br>
elements of the invention are glass elements, in particular<br>
glass plates or glass panes, but also other materials having<br>
the desired optical properties, as long as they satisfy the<br>
technical and physical requirements, for example heat<br>
resistance. However, support elements made of glass are<br>
particularly preferred. It is also possible to use fully or<br>
partially, thermally or chemically prestressed glass as support<br>
material.<br>
The transparent heat protection elements of the invention can,<br>
according to the invention, be produced using a reaction<br>
product containing aqueous alkali metal silicate solution and<br>
aluminate- or borate-modified silicon dioxide, with the<br>
reaction product having a modulus of from 4 to 7, by<br>
introducing this reaction product into a mold cavity between<br>
two support elements or applying it to a support element,<br>
subsequently hardening it to form a solid silicate layer while<br>
retaining the water content and setting the molar ratio of<br>
silicon dioxide to alkali metal oxides (modulus) in the<br>
hardened silicate to a ratio of from 4:1 to 7:1.<br>
The process of the invention thus makes it possible to produce<br>
composite elements which comprise a plurality of support<br>
elements arranged with a spacing between them and subsequently<br>
fill the intermediate space between the support elements with<br>
the reaction product and, if appropriate, one or more further<br>
hardeners such as silica sol, inorganic or organic acids,<br>
esters, acid amides, glyoxals, alkylene carbonates, alkali<br>
metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates, borates, phosphates or<br>
para-formaldehyde. As a result of the high water content, the<br>
composition flows very well and can be poured without<br>
difficulty even into the intermediate ispaces of composite<br>
elements having a small distance between the support elements.<br>
Since the reaction product hardens to form a finished silicate<br>
layer without drying, i.e. without removal of water, a drying<br>
operation can be dispensed with, which considerably simplifies<br>
the production of such heat protection elements. The reaction<br>
or hardening time can be reduced in a known manner by heating.<br>
The pot life of the castable reaction product at room<br>
temperature is in any case sufficiently long to make a normal<br>
production procedure possible. In the production of the heat<br>
production elements, the castable reaction product can, as<br>
described, be introduced or poured into a mold cavity between<br>
at least two support elements. However, it is also possible to<br>
apply the castable reaction product to a support element and<br>
subsequently place a second support element on top of the still<br>
unhardened protective layer or adhesively bond the second<br>
support element onto the protective layer in a known manner<br>
after hardening of said protective layer. In the production of<br>
multiple sandwich structures by the variant of application of<br>
the castable reaction product to a support element, the latter<br>
process would have to be repeated a number of times. The<br>
variant of pouring into appropriate hollow spaces therefore<br>
offers advantages for such structures.<br>
The reaction product is preferably degassed before processing.<br>
This ensures that no gas inclusions which could adversely<br>
affect the optical quality of the heat protection element of<br>
the invention are present in the hardened silicate layer.<br>
However, degassing can also be carried out only after filling<br>
of the hollow spaces. To increase the adhesion of the silicate<br>
layer to the support elements, an auxiliary in the form of<br>
anionic or nonionic surfactants can be added to the reaction<br>
product before processing and/or the surfaces of the support<br>
elements can be pretrcated with such an agent. The surfaces of<br>
the support elements can preferably also be pretreated with a<br>
bonding agent, in particular an organofunctional silane and/or<br>
wax dispersions.<br>
The protective layer of hardened silicate produced according to<br>
the invention has good intrinsic strength and displays good<br>
adhesion to the adjoining support elements, preferably in the<br>
form of glass plates or other transparent components. The<br>
reaction product used as starting composition is flowable and<br>
readily castable. The hardened protective layer is of high<br>
optical quality and transparency and has good aging resistance.<br>
The particular properties of the protective layer in the form<br>
of the hardened silicate are achieved by the silicate layer<br>
having a content of silicon dioxide in the range from 30 to 55%<br>
by weight. The content of alkali metal oxide in the form of<br>
sodium oxide, potassium oxide or lithium oxide or a mixture<br>
thereof is not more than 16%. The hardened silicate layer<br>
contains up to 60% of water. As a result, heat protection<br>
elements of the invention having such a protective layer<br>
achieve a very high fire resistance value since a relatively<br>
large amount of water is available for the vaporization<br>
process. According to the invention, the use of aluminate- or<br>
borate-modified silicon dioxide leads to an improvement in the<br>
aging resistance of the protective layer.<br>
In a transparent heat protection element, the protective layer<br>
or silicate layer is advantageously arranged between two glass<br>
plates and together with these forms a composite element. To<br>
achieve higher heat resistance values, heat protection elements<br>
in which the heat protection element comprises a plurality of<br>
silicate layers arranged in each case between two glass plates<br>
and the glass plates and the polysilicate layers form a<br>
composite element are constructed. In these arrangements<br>
according to the invention, the silicate layers are in direct<br>
contact with the adjoining glass plates which form the support<br>
elements.<br>
The use of a reaction product containing aqueous alkali metal.<br>
silicate solution and aluminate- or boriate-modified silicon<br>
dioxide in protective layers of transparent heat protection<br>
elements has hitherto not been described in this form in the<br>
literature.<br>
The present invention accordingly further provides such a use<br>
of a reaction product containing aqueous alkali metal silicate<br>
solution and aluminate- or borate-modified silicon dioxide in<br>
at least one protective layer of a heat protection element,<br>
characterized in that the reaction product has a modulus of<br>
The preferred ranges for the transparent heat protection<br>
element of the invention apply analogously here.<br>
Such a use is surprising, in particular, because for the reason<br>
mentioned at the outset aluminate- or borate-modification of<br>
silica sols in such a use would be expected to lead to earlier<br>
crystallization and thus to clouding of the protective layer<br>
rather than delay such crystallization.<br>
The following examples serve merely to illustrate the invention<br>
by way of example and are not to be construed as a limitation.<br>
Examples<br>
Reaction products, hereinafter referred to as fire protection<br>
layer composition, are produced by reaction of potassium water<br>
glasses with aluminate- or borate-modified silica sols.<br>
Potassium water glasses having a specific modulus and solids<br>
content are commercially available but can also be prepared as<br>
described below by reaction of silica sols with potassium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of potassium water glass having a<br>
modulus of 2.25 and a solids content of 55% by weight<br>
2460 g of commercial potassium hydroxide pellets having a KOH<br>
content of about 86.5% by weight were placed together with<br>
429 g of deionized water in a 6 liter three-neck stirred flask<br>
provided with condenser and dropping funnel. The three-neck<br>
flask was located in a water bath. While cooling, 5127 g of<br>
Levasil 50/50% (specific surface area: about 50 m2/g; solids<br>
content: about 50.5% by weight; manufacturer: H. C. Starck<br>
GmbH) were added at such a rate that a temperature in the range<br>
from 60 to 80°C was maintained.<br>
After the addition of the silica sol, the mixture was stirred<br>
at 70°C for another 3 hours.<br>
After sedimentation of the precipitate formed as by-product of<br>
the reaction, the solution was decanted off:.<br>
Example 2: Aluminate- or borate-modification of silica sols<br>
having a specific surface area of about SO m2/g and a solids<br>
content of about 50.5% by weight<br>
The aluminate or borate content is repotted in % by weight<br>
calculated as Al2O3 or B.-O3 based on the solids content of the<br>
unmodified silica sol.<br>
For example, sols containing a) 0.64 and b) 0.32% by weight of<br>
Al2O3 and c) 0.22% by weight of B2O3 were produced as follows:<br>
1000 g of Levasil3 50/50% were placed in a three-neck flask<br>
provided with stirrer, heating mantle, dropping funnel and<br>
distillation bridge, a) 60 ml or b) 120 ml of a solution of<br>
25 g of commercial sodium aluminate in 500 ml of water or c) 79<br>
ml of a solution of 5 g of commercial scjdium tetraborate and<br>
6.6 g of 10% strength sodium hydroxide solution in 250 ml of<br>
water were slowly added dropwise.<br>
After the addition was complete, the mixtures were heated and<br>
water was distilled off in such an amount (in ml) that the<br>
original solids content was regained.<br>
The distillation bridge was then replaced by a reflux condenser<br>
and the mixture was refluxed for a total boiling time of 3<br>
hours.<br>
Insoluble material formed was allowed to settle for a period of<br>
3524 hours and separated off by subsequent decantation.<br>
Example 3: Production of a fire protection layer composition<br>
having a modulus of 4.7 from potassium water glass and an<br>
aluminate-modified silica sol containing 0.32% by weight of<br>
Al2O3<br>
170.4 g of a potassium water glass characterized as in example<br>
1 together with 13.5 g of commercial ethylene glycol were<br>
placed in a 250 ml multineck stirred flask with gas outlets.<br>
The mixture was heated to 20°C by means of a heatable water<br>
bath.<br>
116 g of a silica sol produced as described in example 2a) and<br>
containing 0.32% by weight of Al2O3 and having a specific<br>
surface area of 50 m2/g and a solids content of 50.5% were added<br>
over a period of 30 minutes.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred at 20°C for a further<br>
1.5 hours. It was then heated to 40°C over a period of 30<br>
minutes and maintained at this temperature for 30 minutes.<br>
The reaction mixture was cooled to 20°C over a period of 15<br>
minutes by replacement of water in the heating bath. The<br>
mixture was stirred for a further SO minutes at this<br>
temperature. During the last 20 minutes, a; water pump vacuum of<br>
about 110 mbar was applied via the gas outlet.<br>
About 60 ml of this reaction mixture were transferred by means<br>
of a glass piston-type pipette into a 100 ml glass bottle which<br>
was closed by means of a crown seal.<br>
The bottled sample was heated at 80°C in a drying oven for<br>
about 20 hours.<br>
The absence of a sediment was then visually confirmed as a<br>
criterion for complete reaction and a turbidity of 1.6 TU/F<br>
(turbidity units based on formazine) was measured by means of a<br>
suitable turbidity photometer (e.g. model LTP 5 from Lange).<br>
The storage of the sample at 80°C was then continued with<br>
regular measurement of the turbidity until 3.5 TU/F was reached<br>
after 63 days, i.e. turbidity could be observed visually.<br>
Example 4: Production of a fire protection layer composition<br>
having a modulus of 4.7 from potassium water glass and an<br>
aluminate-modified silica sol containing 0.64% by weight of<br>
Al2O3<br>
A silica sol produced as described in example 2b) and<br>
containing 0.64% by weight of Al2O3 and having a specific<br>
surface area of 50 m2/g and a solids content of 50.5% was<br>
reacted by the reaction procedure described in example 3.<br>
After heating for 20 hours as described in example 3, the<br>
sample had a turbidity of 4.5 TU/F. After the reaction was<br>
complete, the turbidity was reduced to 2.1 TU/F after 3 days.<br>
After 83 days, a renewed increase in the turbidity to 3.5 TU/F<br>
was observed.<br>
Example 5: Production of a fire protection layer composition<br>
having a modulus of 4.7 from potassium water glass and a<br>
borate-modified silica sol containing 0.22% of B2O3<br>
A silica sol produced as described in example 2c) and<br>
containing 0.22% by weight of B2O3 and having a specific surface<br>
area of 50 m2/g and a solids content of 50.5% was reacted by the<br>
reaction procedure described in example 3.<br>
After heating for 20 hours as described in example 3, the<br>
sample showed a sediment and had a turbiditjy of 2.2 TU/F.<br>
The increase in turbidity to 3.5 TU/F was found after 25 days.<br>
Comparative example: Production of a fire protection layer<br>
composition from potassium water glass andj an unmodified silica<br>
sol<br>
An unmodified silica sol having a specific surface area of 50<br>
m2/g and a solids content of 50.5% was reacted by the reaction<br>
procedure described in example 3.<br>
After heating for 20 hours as described in example 3, the<br>
sample showed a sediment and had a turbiditjy of 1.5 TU/F.<br>
The increase in the turbidity to 3.5 TU/F was observed after 20<br>
days.<br>
