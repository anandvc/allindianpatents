MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to medical supplies and,<br>
particularly, to an improvement in the antimicrobial activity<br>
of medical supplies such as artificial bones and osteosynthetic<br>
and fixation devices which are implanted in living bodies prior<br>
to use.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The recent development of medical technologies has led<br>
to the situation where many technologies are used clinically<br>
for grafting implants that repair and substitute bones and<br>
joints which are defectives or have depleted functions in living<br>
bodies such as the human bodies. As to the characteristics<br>
required for each of the implants used in these technologies,<br>
the implants are desired to have the same strength as part of<br>
a living body before substituted and also, firstly<br>
compatibility with a living body, that is, biocompatibility.<br>
Examples of biocompatible metallic materials having such<br>
characteristics include titanium, titanium alloys, stainless<br>
steel and Co-Cr alloys . However, these metallic materials have<br>
no living activity so that they are not chemically bonded to<br>
a bone, causing problems concerning the occurrences of a gap<br>
and loosening during a long time of use.<br>
In light of such problems, there is described in , for<br>
example. Patent Document 1, a method of forming an oxide film<br>
in which a hydrogen peroxide-containing paste is brought into<br>
contact with the surface of a metal which is a base material<br>
to thereby convert the surface of the base material into a metal<br>
oxide. It is described in the document that according to this<br>
technologies, an oxide film can be formed in a short time and<br>
good biocompatibility is obtained.<br>
Further, separately from the above problems, these<br>
implants cause the problem that when these implants are grafted<br>
in living bodies, infections such as suppuration of diseased<br>
part are caused with high incidence.<br>
To deal with such a problem, there is the idea of using,<br>
as implant materials, Cu and Ag that are widely known to exhibit<br>
excellent antimicrobial activity. For example, Non-Patent<br>
Document 1 reveals the results obtained by carrying out an<br>
experiment in which Ag known to exhibit high antimicrobial<br>
activity is transplanted as an implant (made of pure silver)<br>
to an animal (hamster). According to these results, it is<br>
necessary to cautiously decide whether to use Ag as an implant<br>
material because a silver implant causes severer inflammation<br>
and swelling as compared with a titanium or stainless steel<br>
implant, showing that the silver implant is deteriorated in<br>
affinity to a living body.<br>
Further, Non-Patent Document 2 reports the result of an<br>
experiment concerning inhibition to pin-infections in the case<br>
of using an external fixation pin coated with Ag. According<br>
to these results, it is not observed that bacterial cells are<br>
sufficiently reduced by the Ag coating and it is observed that<br>
a rise in Ag level in blood by the grafting of the Ag-coated<br>
external fixation pin in a living body.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
In light of the prior art problems like this, it is an<br>
object of the present invention to provide medical supplies<br>
which can inhibit infections with various bacteria for a long<br>
period of time, have excellent antimicrobial activity, and are<br>
superior in the durability of antimicrobial activity and also<br>
in superior in biocompatibility, and to provide a method of<br>
producing the medical supplies.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
The inventors of the present invention focused their<br>
attentions on iodine and iodine compounds as materials having<br>
antimicrobial activity. Iodine has sterilizing activity and<br>
antimicrobial activity, is also used as disinfectants and is<br>
said to have small toxicity to living bodies. In light of this,<br>
the inventors of the present invention have conceived of<br>
impregnating the surface of an implant base material with iodine<br>
or iodine compounds to inhibit infections associated with an<br>
implant. The inventors of the present invention have conceived<br>
of an idea that if the surface of an implant base material is<br>
impregnated with iodine or iodine compounds and iodine is<br>
allowed to be discharged gradually, this enables the implant<br>
itself to be sterilized and is also very effective to maintain<br>
the antimicrobial activity afterward. The inventors of the<br>
present invention made further studies and as a result, found<br>
that when the base material was anodically oxidized in an<br>
electrolytic solution having a specific composition by using<br>
pulsed current having a frequency in a predetermined range, an<br>
oxide film having many micro pores was formed on the base<br>
material and also, these micro pores could be impregnated with<br>
iodine or iodine compounds, showing that these pores were very<br>
effective to improve the continuation of antimicrobial<br>
activity.<br>
First, the fundamental experiment made by the inventors<br>
of the present invention will be described.<br>
A Ti alloy (mass% basis, 6% Al-4% V-rest Ti; JIS type-60<br>
alloy) was used as the base material to produce disc-like test<br>
piece (plate thickness: 1.5 mm). These test pieces were<br>
subjected to degreasing treatment and then to anodic oxidation<br>
treatment. In the anodic oxidation treatment, the test piece<br>
was electrolyzed at a constant voltage (150 V) for 5 minutes<br>
in an acid electrolytic solution (solution temperature: room<br>
temperature) of a mixture bath containing sulfuric acid (35<br>
g/1)-phosphoric acid (25 g/1)-aqueous hydrogen peroxide (10<br>
g/1). In this case, though the current load was made to have<br>
an initial current density of 8 A/dm2, the current value was<br>
dropped in order along with passage of time because of the<br>
electrolysis at constant voltage. In this case, as the current,<br>
50 to 10000 Hz pulsed current was used. The test was also made<br>
by using direct current (DC) as the current load.<br>
Then, the anodically oxidized test piece was cleaned with<br>
water and then, subjected to iodine-impregnation treatment in<br>
which the test piece was dipped in an aqueous iodine compound<br>
solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 mass% of a polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone iodine (PVPI) which was an iodine compound in pure<br>
water, the test piece was arranged on the anode side and a pure<br>
Ti plate was arranged on the cathode side, and the test piece<br>
was electrolyzed at a constant voltage of 120 V for 5 minutes<br>
to cause electrophoresis, thereby impregnating an oxide film<br>
of the surface of the test piece with the iodine compound. In<br>
this impregnation with iodine compound, the initial current<br>
density was set to about 0.2 A/dm2. A part of the test pieces<br>
were not subjected to the impregnation with iodine compound.<br>
First, the anodically oxidized test pieces were subjected<br>
to a scanning electron microscope (magnification: 2500 times)<br>
to be used to observe the surface structure of the oxide film<br>
formed on the surface of the test piece. Each test piece was<br>
observed from five or more visual fields to measure the number<br>
of pores formed in the oxide film in each visual field. Then,<br>
an arithmetic average of the obtained values was calculated to<br>
determine the number of pores of the oxide film formed on the<br>
surface of each test piece. In this case, the section of each<br>
test piece was also observed by a scanning electron microscope<br>
(magnification: 2500 times) to measure the thickness of the<br>
formed oxide film.<br>
Further, with regard to the test pieces subjected to<br>
anodic oxidation treatment and the test pieces subjected to<br>
anodic oxidation treatment and iodine-impregnation treatment,<br>
an antimicrobial activity test was made by the film covering<br>
method according to the provisions of JIS Z 2801. Escherichia<br>
coli (JCM 1649 strains) was used as the pathogenic organ and<br>
the cells number left after a prescribed time (24 h) passed was<br>
measured to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the test<br>
piece. The test was repeated two times each. As the cells<br>
number left after a prescribed time passed is smaller, the test<br>
piece is evaluated to be superior in antimicrobial activity.<br>
When the cells number which was, at first, 36000/ml (3.6 x<br>
104/ml) was decreased to less than 10/ml after a prescribed time<br>
(24 h) passed, this was rated as 4 (antimicrobial activity<br>
value), when the cells number was 10 or more and less than 100/ml,<br>
this was rated as 3 (antimicrobial activity value), when the<br>
cells number was 100 or more and less than 1000/ml, this was<br>
rated as 2 (antimicrobial activity value) , when the cells number<br>
was 1000 or more and less than 10000/ml, this was rated as 1<br>
(antimicrobial activity value), and when the cells number was<br>
10000 or more, this was rated as 0 (antimicrobial activity<br>
value).<br>
The obtained results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[Table 1]<br>
In the case where the iodine-impregnation treatment is<br>
not carried out but only anodic oxidation treatment is carried<br>
out, the antimicrobial activity value is 0 and no improvement<br>
in antimicrobial activity is observed. The antimicrobial<br>
activity is improved more significantly in the case of<br>
performing anodic oxidation treatment by adding pulsed current<br>
at a frequency of 50 Hz or more than in the case of performing<br>
anodic oxidation treatment by adding direct current- It is<br>
clarified that the antimicrobial activity is significantly<br>
improved when anodic oxidation treatment is performed by<br>
applying pulsed current at a frequency of, particularly, 800<br>
Hz or more and more preferably 1000 to 5000 Hz. This is<br>
clarified from the relation between the density of the formed<br>
micro pores and the frequency of the pulsed current load in the<br>
anodic oxidation treatment as illustrated in Fig. 1. It is<br>
found from Fig. 1 that when the frequency of the pulsed current<br>
load is made to be 50 Hz or more, the density of micro pores<br>
to be formed is significantly increased to as high as 5 x 104/mm2.<br>
When the frequency is 0, that is, when direct current is applied,<br>
only groovy unevenness is formed on the film and almost no micro<br>
pore is formed as shown in Fig. 3(a). When the frequency of<br>
the applied pulse current is 50 Hz on the contrary, the groovy<br>
unevenness disappears and many micro pores are clearly formed<br>
on the film as shown in Fig. 3(b) . Moreover, when the frequency<br>
of the applied pulse current is as high as 1000 Hz, many more<br>
micro pores are formed as shown in Fig. 3(c) . It has been found<br>
from the comparison shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1 that the supplies<br>
which have a film having micro pores increased in pore density<br>
to at least 5 x 104/mm2 or more and which has been subjected<br>
to iodine-impregnation treatment are able to have excellent<br>
antimicrobial activity.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 2, it has been found that if<br>
pulse current having a frequency of 50 Hz or more is applied<br>
to carry out anodic oxidation treatment, many micro pores are<br>
formed and a film 3 [ini or more in thickness can be formed.<br>
It has been found from the above results that when pulse<br>
current having a frequency of 50 Hz or more is applied to carry<br>
out anodic oxidation treatment, a film which contains many micro<br>
pores described above and has a thickness of, preferably 3 \xm<br>
or more can be formed on the base material and that when the<br>
film is impregnated with iodine or iodine compounds, the<br>
antimicrobial activity of the base material is significantly<br>
improved.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to medical supplies using<br>
a base material made of a metallic material, and is provided<br>
with a film having micro pores and/or micro unevennesses on the<br>
base material. The term "micro pores and/or micro<br>
unevennesses" used herein means the surface state of the base<br>
material changed from the initial state by artificially<br>
carrying out heat treatment, mechanical treatment,<br>
electrochemical treatment or chemical treatment or<br>
combinations of these treatments. Then, the term "micro pore"<br>
means a circular or polygonal pore having an area-equivalent<br>
circle diameter of about 1 to 10 fim. Further, the term "micro<br>
unevennesses" means the surface state on which unevennesses<br>
having a depth of several micrometers (^m) to several hundreds<br>
of micrometers (surface roughness Ra: about several micrometers<br>
([jm) to several hundreds of micrometers (\ua) )exist as these<br>
pores are deformed or integrated.<br>
The film to be formed on the surface of the base material<br>
may be one only having micro pores and/or micro unevennesses<br>
such as those mentioned above and no particular limitation is<br>
imposed on a method of forming the film. However, the film is<br>
preferably one formed by any one of electrochemical treatment,<br>
chemical treatment, thermal and/or mechanical treatment or a<br>
combination of two or more of these treatments. It is<br>
preferable to adopt anodic oxidation treatment as the<br>
electrochemical treatment, medicine treatment as the chemical<br>
treatment, heating treatment as the thermal treatment, thermal<br>
processing treatment as the thermal and mechanical treatment,<br>
and mechanical processing treatment as the mechanical treatment.<br>
These treatments enable easy formation of a film having micro<br>
pores and/or micro unevennesses having a desired density. The<br>
desired density of the micro pores and/or micro unevennesses<br>
is preferably at least 5 x 104/mm2 or more. When such a film<br>
having micro pores and/or micro unevennesses having a desired<br>
density is formed on the surface of the base material, the<br>
surface of the base material can be impregnated stably and<br>
sufficiently with iodine or iodine compounds which improve the<br>
antimicrobial activity and sterilizing activity of the<br>
supplies.<br>
Then, micro pores or micro unevennesses of the film are<br>
impregnated with iodine or iodine compounds. Since iodine has<br>
antimicrobial activity and sterilizing activity, the<br>
antimicrobial activity and sterilizing activity of the supplies<br>
are improved by the action of iodine which is gradually released<br>
from iodine or iodine compound with which the micro pores or<br>
micro unevennesses of the film are impregnated. When,<br>
particularly, micro pores or micro unevennesses of the film are<br>
impregnated with iodine or iodine compounds, this has such a<br>
merit that the area of the surface capable of holding iodine<br>
or iodine compounds is more increased than in the case of<br>
applying iodine or iodine compound to a plane, enabling the<br>
above iodine or iodine compound to be supported in a large amount<br>
and also, the release of iodine from iodine or iodine compounds<br>
is continued gradually for a long time. This makes it possible<br>
to maintain the antimicrobial activity and sterilizing activity<br>
of the supplies for a long period of time.<br>
Examples of the iodine compound with which the supplies<br>
are impregnated may include;<br>
inorganic compounds such as silver iodide, potassium<br>
iodide, nickel iodide, iron iodide and tin iodide;<br>
organic compounds, for example, chain saturated<br>
hydrocarbons and their derivatives such as methyl iodide, ethyl<br>
iodide, propyl iodide, butyl iodide, and isopropyl iodide;<br>
also, chain unsaturated hydrocarbons and their<br>
derivatives such as vinyl iodide, anyl iodide, crotyl iodide,<br>
propargyl iodide, and phenylacetylene iodide;<br>
also, aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives such<br>
as iodobenzene, benzyl iodide, benzoyl iodide, phenacyl iodide,<br>
xylylene iodide, phthalein iodide, hydroquinone iodide, and<br>
cyclodextrin-iodine inclusion compounds;<br>
also, hetero-compounds such as trimethylsulfonium iodide<br>
and triphenylsulfonium iodide; and<br>
hetero-compound polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone.<br>
iodine and polyvinylphthalimide iodine.<br>
Among the above iodine compounds, hetero-compound<br>
polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons and their derivatives such as |3-cyclodextrin<br>
iodine or inorganic compounds such as silver iodide are<br>
preferable as the iodine compound with which the supplies are<br>
impregnated, from the viewpoint of safety to the human body,<br>
environmental integrity and biocompatibility.<br>
Though no particular limitation is imposed on the type<br>
of metallic material to be used as the base material in the<br>
present invention insofar as the metallic material is suitable<br>
for use as medical supplies, Ti or Co is preferably used if it<br>
is a pure metal or a Ti alloy, Co alloy, stainless steel or Co-Cr<br>
alloy is preferably used if it is an alloy. It is more<br>
preferable to use Ti and Ti alloy, stainless steel or Co-Cr alloy<br>
taking it into account to transplant the supplies to living<br>
bodies. Ti is preferably pure Ti prescribed as JIS type-1 or<br>
JIS type-2 or a Ti alloy prescribed as JIS type-60 (6% Al-4%<br>
V-Ti alloy), JIS type-61 (3% Al-2% V-Ti alloy), 15-3-3 alloy,<br>
JIS type-11 or JIS type-12 are each applicable. Further, as<br>
the above stainless steel, austenite stainless steels such as<br>
SUS 302, SUS 304, SUS 316, SUS 316L, SUS 317J4L, SUS 329Jl and<br>
SUS 329J3L are preferable from the viewpoint of non-magnetism.<br>
Further, as the above Co-Cr alloy, a stellite 20 alloy having<br>
a composition of 63.0% Cr-6.0% Mo-2.0% Ni-0.25% C-rest Cr is<br>
preferable from the viewpoint of strength and corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
Next, a method of producing medical supplies according<br>
to the present invention will be described.<br>
A base material made of any one of the metallic materials<br>
is preferably formed into a predetermined shape, and is then<br>
subjected to degreasing treatment. Then, the base material is<br>
subjected to any one of electrochemical treatment, chemical<br>
treatment, thermal and/or mechanical treatment or a combination<br>
of two or more of these treatments to form a film on the surface<br>
of the base material. It is preferable to adopt anodic<br>
oxidation treatment as the electrochemical treatment, medicine<br>
treatment as the chemical treatment, heating treatment as the<br>
thermal treatment, thermal processing treatment as the thermal<br>
and mechanical treatment and mechanical processing treatment<br>
as the mechanical treatment. The method will be described<br>
concerning the case of performing anodic oxidation treatment<br>
to form a film on the surface of the base material as an example.<br>
It is needless to say that the present invention is not limited<br>
to the anodic oxidation treatment.<br>
In the anodic oxidation treatment, the base material<br>
formed into a predetermined shape is dipped in an electrolytic<br>
solution and used as the anode to apply current to electrolyze.<br>
As the electrolytic solution to be used, an acid electrolytic<br>
bath or alkali electrolytic bath is used corresponding to the<br>
type of base material.<br>
Examples of the acid electrolytic bath may include a<br>
sulfuric acid-water mixture bath (for example, content of<br>
sulfuric acid: 5 to 30 mass% and preferably 10 to 25 mass%),<br>
sulfuric acid-phosphoric acid-water mixture bath (for example,<br>
sulfuric acid 35 g/1 and phosphoric acid 25 g/1), sulfuric<br>
acid-phosphoric acid-aqueous hydrogen peroxide-water mixture<br>
bath (for example, sulfuric acid 35 g/1, phosphoric acid 25 g/1,<br>
and aqueous hydrogen peroxide 10 g/1), sulfuric acid-phosphoric<br>
acid-ascorbic acid-water mixture bath (for example, sulfuric<br>
acid 35 g/1, phosphoric acid 25 g/1 and ascorbic acid 10 g/1)<br>
and hydrochloric acid-aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide-formalin-water mixture bath (for example,<br>
hydrochloric acid 40 mass%, aqueous hydrogen peroxide 2 mass!<br>
and formalin 10 mass%).<br>
Further, examples of the alkali electrolytic bath may<br>
include potassium hydroxide-potassium fluoride-sodium<br>
phosphate-aluminum hydroxide-water mixture bath (for example,<br>
potassium hydroxide 165 g/1, potassium fluoride 35 g/1, sodium<br>
phosphate 35 g/1 and aluminum hydroxide 35 g/1).<br>
It is preferable to use the acid electrolytic bath when<br>
the base material is Ti or a Ti alloy or stainless steel, and<br>
the alkali electrolytic bath when the base material is a Co-Cr<br>
alloy.<br>
In the electrolysis, pulsed current having a frequency<br>
of 50 Hz or more and preferably 10000 Hz or less is used as the<br>
current load. When pulsed current having a frequency of 50 Hz<br>
or more is used as the current load, a film including micro pores<br>
and/or micro unevennesses having a density of at least 5 x 104/mm2<br>
can be formed. When the current load is direct current (DC),<br>
only a film containing neither micro pore nor micro-unevenness<br>
can be formed as shown in Fig. 3(a). Such a film can be<br>
insufficiently impregnated with iodine and an iodine compound<br>
with result that sufficient antimicrobial activity cannot be<br>
imparted to the supplies . In this case, large-scaled equipment<br>
is required to generate pulsed current having a frequency<br>
exceeding 10000 Hz and therefore, the cost required for the<br>
equipment is increased, bringing about high production cost.<br>
From the above reason, the current applied in the anodic<br>
oxidation treatment in the invention is preferably 50 to 10000<br>
Hz pulsed current. The frequency is more preferably 1000 to<br>
5000 Hz from the viewpoint of the number of micro-pores to be<br>
formed.<br>
Medicine treatment as the chemical treatment, heating<br>
treatment as the thermal treatment, heating processing<br>
treatment as the thermal and mechanical treatment, or<br>
mechanical processing treatment as the mechanical treatment or<br>
a combination of two or more of these treatments may be adopted<br>
in place of the anodic oxidation treatment as the<br>
electrochemical treatment.<br>
Examples of the medicine treatment may include a method<br>
in which a high-temperature alkali-type bath or an acid bath<br>
is used and the base material is dipped in this bath to form<br>
chemically treated film having micro pores and/or micro<br>
unevennesses on the surface of the base material. A method in<br>
which as the high-temperature alkali-type bath, for example,<br>
a 140°C sodium hydroxide-potassium nitrate-water mixture bath<br>
(for example, 60 parts by weight of sodium hydroxide, 40 parts<br>
by weight of potassium nitrate and 500 parts by weight of water)<br>
is used and the base material is dipped in this bath for 10<br>
minutes and a method in which as the acid bath, for example,<br>
a 30°C oxalic acid-hydrogen peroxide-water mixture bath (for<br>
example, 25 mass% of oxalic acid (100 g/1) and 3.5 mass% of<br>
hydrogen peroxide (30%)) is used and the base material is dipped<br>
in this bath for 30 minutes are exemplified. This treatment<br>
is preferably applied in the case of using stainless steel such<br>
as SUS 304 as the base material.<br>
Further, examples of the heating treatment may include<br>
a method in which the base material is heated (heating<br>
temperature: 600 to 800°C and preferably 700°C x 1 hr) in the<br>
atmosphere to form a film (oxide film) on the surface of the<br>
base material. Further, examples of the thermal processing<br>
treatment may include methods in which the surface of the base<br>
material is irradiated with an electron beam or laser beam.<br>
Further, examples of the mechanical processing treatment may<br>
include methods using a shot blasting. In these treatments,<br>
it is essential to make an examination in advance before<br>
determining the treatment conditions so that a film having micro<br>
unevennesses or micro pores having a desired surface structure.<br>
In this case, these treatments are preferably applied when<br>
stainless steel or a Co-Cr alloy is used as the base material.<br>
In the present invention, treatment such as anodic<br>
oxidation treatment is performed to form a film having micro<br>
pores or micro unevennesses on the surface of the base material<br>
and then, iodine-impregnation treatment is carried out to<br>
impregnate the film with iodine or iodine compounds.<br>
The iodine-impregnation treatment can be carried out as<br>
follows: the base material which has been subjected to, for<br>
example, anodic oxidation treatment is cleaned with water, then<br>
dipped in an aqueous iodine or iodine compound solution and<br>
direct current is applied by using the base material as the anode<br>
to carry out electrolysis at a constant voltage or constant<br>
current density. The aqueous solution used for the<br>
electrolysis is preferably an aqueous solution containing 0.1<br>
to 1.0 mass% of iodine or iodine compounds. When the amount<br>
of iodine or iodine compounds is less than 0.1 mass%, the content<br>
of iodine with which the film is impregnated is so small that<br>
desired antimicrobial activity cannot be developed. Even if<br>
iodine or iodine compound is added in an amount exceeding 1.0<br>
mass% on the other hand, the effect is saturated and this is<br>
economically disadvantageous. The amount of iodine or iodine<br>
compound is more preferably 0.3 to 0.5 mass%.<br>
Further, as the iodine compound to be added in the aqueous<br>
solution, the iodine compounds are all preferable. Among these<br>
compounds, polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine (PVPI), (3-cyclodextrin<br>
iodine (BCDI) and silver iodide are preferable from the<br>
viewpoint of biocompatibility.<br>
In the iodine-impregnation treatment, the constant<br>
voltage anodizing is preferably carried out at a constant<br>
voltage ranging from 100 to 200 V for 1 to 10 minutes. The<br>
constant current density anodizing is preferably carried out<br>
at a constant current density ranging from 0.05 to 10 A/dm2 for<br>
1 to 10 minutes.<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail<br>
by way of Examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
(Example 1)<br>
A Ti alloy (mass% basis, 6% Al-4% V-rest Ti; JIS type-60<br>
alloy) and stainless steel (SUS 304) were used as base materials<br>
to manufacture discs (plate thickness: 2.0 mm) as test pieces<br>
for in-vitro test and external fixation pins for a rabbit as<br>
test pieces for in-vivo test.<br>
Among these test pieces, the Ti alloy test pieces were<br>
subjected to degreasing treatment and then to anodic oxidation<br>
treatment. In the anodic oxidation treatment, the test piece<br>
was electrolyzed at a constant voltage (150 V) for 5 minutes<br>
in an acid electrolytic solution (solution temperature: ambient<br>
temperature) of a mixture bath containing sulfuric acid (35<br>
g/1)-phosphoric acid (25 g/1)-aqueous hydrogen peroxide (10<br>
g/1) . In this case, though the current load was made to have<br>
an initial current density of 8 A/dm2, the current value was<br>
dropped in order along with passage of time because of the<br>
electrolysis at constant voltage. In this case, as the current,<br>
pulsed current having a frequency of 10000 Hz was used. The<br>
test pieces which the anodic oxidation treatment was not<br>
performed was regarded as comparative examples.<br>
First, the anodically oxidized test pieces (Ti alloy test<br>
pieces) were subjected to a scanning electron microscope<br>
(magnification: 2500 times) to observe the surface structure<br>
of the oxide film formed on one surface of each test piece in<br>
five or more visual fields, thereby measuring the number of<br>
pores formed in the oxide film in each visual field. Then, an<br>
arithmetic average of the values obtained in the visual fields<br>
was calculated to determine the number of pores- of the oxide<br>
film formed on the surface of each test piece. Further, the<br>
section of each test piece was observed by a scanning electron<br>
microscope (magnification: 2500 times) in five visual fields<br>
to measure an average thickness of the oxide film formed on the<br>
surface.<br>
Then, the anodically oxidized test pieces (Ti alloy test<br>
pieces) were cleaned with water for one minute. After cleaning<br>
with water, the test piece was dipped in an aqueous iodine<br>
compound solution prepared by dissolving 0 . 5 mass% of polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone iodine (PVPI) which was an iodine compound in pure<br>
water and the test piece was settled on the anode side and a<br>
pure Ti plate was settled on the cathode side to perform<br>
electrolysis at a constant voltage of 120 V, thereby carrying<br>
out iodine-impregnation treatment. In the<br>
iodine-impregnation treatment, the initial current density was<br>
set to about 0.2 A/dm2 to cause electrophoresis to impregnate<br>
the oxide film formed on the surface of the test piece with the<br>
iodine compound.<br>
In this case, the test pieces which were not anodically<br>
oxidized were degreased and cleaned with water for one minute<br>
prior to the test.<br>
Then, using a part of these treated obtained test pieces<br>
(discs), an antimicrobial activity test was made for in-vivo<br>
test according to the provisions of JIS Z 2801. As the<br>
pathogenic organ. Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and<br>
Escherichia coli (MG 1455) were used. The test was repeated<br>
15 times for each test piece. As the cells number left after<br>
a predetermined time passed is smaller, the test piece is<br>
evaluated to be superior in antimicrobial activity.<br>
Further, using the obtained test piece (semicircular<br>
plate), the cytotoxicity of the test piece was evaluated for<br>
in-vitro test by the colony forming method using rat fibroblast<br>
cell line V79. The test piece was dipped in a culture fluid<br>
contained in a Petri dish and the above V79 was inoculated on<br>
the test piece to confirm the formation of colonies for the<br>
evaluation.<br>
Further, using the obtained rabbit external fixation pin,<br>
6 Japan white house rabbits were used and the pin was made to<br>
pierce through each of the thighbones for in vivo test. After<br>
14 days, the rabbit was made to die a gentle and easy death to<br>
make histological analysis and the degrees of the inflammation<br>
and infection of the tissue around the pin-pierced part were<br>
observed to give percentile scores to these degrees to evaluate.<br>
The evaluation items are as follows: inflammation of the<br>
pin-pierced part, abscess around the pin, marrow, and<br>
inflammation around the tip of the pin. The point was 2 when<br>
the inflammation or formation of abscess caused by the pin was<br>
serious illness, 1 when the inflammation or formation of abscess<br>
was minor, 2 when marrow formed abscess and 1 when the marrow<br>
was minor and 0 in other cases, to evaluate by the total points<br>
of the evaluation items. As the total point of the evaluation<br>
items is smaller, inflammation and infection are regarded as<br>
small. Further, at the same time, osteoid formation on the<br>
surface of the pin was confirmed to evaluate osteoconductivity.<br>
The results obtained are shown in Table 2.<br>
It is found that an oxide film having micro pores as many<br>
as 5 x lOVmm2 or more in number is formed in Example of the<br>
present invention (test piece No. Al).<br>
Further, in Example of the present invention (test piece<br>
No. Al) , the formation of colonies is significantly suppressed,<br>
so that the number of Staphylococcus aureus which is about 2000<br>
before the start of the antimicrobial test is reduced to an<br>
average of 0.07 after 24 hr and also, the number of Escherichia<br>
coli which is about 2000 before the start of the antimicrobial<br>
test is reduced to an average of 0 after 24 hr, showing that<br>
Example of the present invention is superior in antimicrobial<br>
activity. In Comparative Examples, on the other hand, the cells<br>
number observed after 24 hr is 181 (test piece No. A2) and 347<br>
(test piece No. A3) in the case of Staphylococcus aureus and<br>
1281 (test piece No. A2) and 1600 (test piece No. A3) in the<br>
case of Escherichia coli. These differences may be said to have<br>
statistical significance.<br>
Further, in Example of the present invention, the total<br>
point of the evaluation of inflammation and infection is<br>
significantly lower than in Comparative Examples and therefore,<br>
it may be said that Example of the present invention is reduced<br>
in inflammation and infection. Further, this difference from<br>
Comparative Examples also has statistical significance and this<br>
shows that Example of the present invention reduces infection<br>
induced by a pin and is superior in antimicrobial activity and<br>
biocompatibility. Further, Example of the present invention<br>
is similar to titanium in good osteoid and bone formation and<br>
it may be said that Example of the present invention has<br>
sufficient osteoconductivity.<br>
Moreover, it has been confirmed that Example of the<br>
present invention is similar to Comparative Examples in that<br>
the colonies of rat fibroblast cell line V79 are well formed,<br>
so that it has no cytotoxicity.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Stainless steel (SUS 304) was used as a base material to<br>
manufacture disc-like test pieces (plate thickness: 2 mm) for<br>
antimicrobial test. These test pieces were each washed with<br>
an acid and then subjected to anodic oxidation treatment or to<br>
medicine treatment. In the acid washing treatment, the test<br>
pieces were dipped in an aqueous mixture solution of nitric acid<br>
(5%)-hydrofluoric acid (3%) at a liquid temperature of 40°C for<br>
3 minutes. In the anodic oxidation treatment, the test pieces<br>
were electrolyzed at a constant voltage (100 V) for 15 minutes<br>
by using the test piece as the anode and pure Ti plate as the<br>
cathode in an acid electrolytic solution (solution temperature:<br>
ambient temperature) of a mixture bath containing hydrochloric<br>
acid (47 mass%)-aqueous hydrogen peroxide (2 mass%)-formalin<br>
(10 mass%)-water. As the current load, pulsed current having<br>
a frequency of 3000 Hz was used. The initial current value was<br>
3.5 A/dm2. In the medicine treatment, the test pieces were<br>
dipped in a 30°C mixture bath of oxalic acid (25 mass%) -hydrogen<br>
peroxide (3.5 mass%)-distilled water which was a<br>
high-temperature acid bath for 30 minutes.<br>
The test pieces which were anodically oxidized or treated<br>
using a medicine were subjected to a scanning electron<br>
microscope (magnification: 2500 times) to observe the surface<br>
structure of the film (oxide film) formed on the surface of each<br>
test piece in five or more visual fields, thereby measuring the<br>
number of pores formed in the film in each visual field. Then,<br>
an arithmetic average of the values obtained in the visual<br>
fields was calculated to determine the number of pores of the<br>
film formed on the surface of each test piece. Further, the<br>
section of each test piece was observed by a scanning electron<br>
microscope (magnification: 2500 times) in five visual fields<br>
to measure an average thickness of the film formed on the<br>
surface.<br>
Then, a part of the test pieces were cleaned with water.<br>
After cleaning with water, the test piece was dipped in an<br>
aqueous iodine compound solution prepared by dissolving 0.5<br>
mass% of polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine (PVPI) which was an iodine<br>
compound in pure water and the test piece was settled on the<br>
anode side and a pure Ti plate was settled on the cathode side<br>
to perform electrolysis at a constant voltage of 120 V (direct<br>
current (DC)) for 5 minutes to cause electrophoresis, thereby<br>
carrying out iodine-impregnation treatment to impregnate the<br>
oxide film formed on the surface of the test piece with the iodine<br>
compound. In the iodine-impregnation treatment, the initial<br>
current density shown was about 0.2 A/dm2.<br>
With regard to the test pieces which were only anodically<br>
oxidized or treated using a medicine and test pieces subjected<br>
to iodine-impregnation treatment after anodically oxidized or<br>
treated using a medicine, an antimicrobial activity test was<br>
made by the film covering method according to the provisions<br>
of JIS Z 2801. As the pathogenic organ, Escherichia coli (JCM<br>
1649 strain) was used and cells number left after a<br>
predetermined time (24 h) passed was measured to evaluate the<br>
antimicrobial activity. As the cells number left after a<br>
predetermined time passed is smaller, the test piece is<br>
evaluated to be superior in antimicrobial activity. When cells<br>
number which was 42000/ml (4.2 x 104/ml) at first was measured<br>
after a predetermined time (24 h) passed, the case where the<br>
cells number was reduced to less than 10/ml was rated as 4<br>
(antimicrobial activity value), the case where the cells number<br>
was reduced to 10/ml or more and less than 100/ml was rated as<br>
3 (antimicrobial activity value), the case where the cells<br>
number was reduced to 100/ml or more and less than 1000/ml was<br>
rated as 2 (antimicrobial activity value), the case where the<br>
cells number was reduced to 1000/ml or more and less than<br>
10000/ml was rated as 1 (antimicrobial activity value), and the<br>
case where the cells number was 10000/ml or more was rated as<br>
0 (antimicrobial activity value).<br>
The results obtained are shown in Table 3.<br>
It is found that all Examples of the present invention<br>
exhibit the rate 4 (antimicrobial activity value), so that they<br>
each keep excellent antimicrobial activity. With regard to<br>
Comparative Examples in which no iodine-impregnation treatment<br>
is performed, the antimicrobial activity value is 0, that is,<br>
these Comparative Examples do not exhibit any antimicrobial<br>
activity.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
A Co-Cr alloy (mass% basis, 63.0% Co-6.0% Mo-2.0%<br>
Ni-0.25% C-rest Cr) was used as a base material to manufacture<br>
disc-like test pieces (plate thickness: 5.0 mm) for<br>
antimicrobial test. These test pieces were each washed with<br>
an acid and then subjected to anodic oxidation treatment.<br>
In the anodic oxidation treatment, the test piece was<br>
electrolyzed at a constant voltage (150 V, direct current (DC))<br>
for 15 minutes by using the test piece as the anode and pure<br>
Ti plate as the cathode in an alkali electrolytic solution<br>
(solution temperature: room temperature) of a mixture bath<br>
containing potassium hydroxide (165 g/1)-potassium fluoride<br>
(35 g/1)-sodium phosphate (35 g/1)-aluminum hydroxide (35<br>
g/1)-water. As the current load, pulsed current having a<br>
frequency of 5000 Hz was used. The initial current value was<br>
8 A/dm2.<br>
The obtained test pieces were subjected to a scanning<br>
electron microscope (magnification: 2500 times) to observe the<br>
surface structure of the film (oxide film) formed on the surface<br>
of each test piece, thereby determining the number of pores<br>
formed on the surface of each test piece and the average<br>
thickness of the film in the same manner as in Example 2.<br>
Then, a part of the test pieces subjected to these<br>
treatments were cleaned with water. Then, the test piece was<br>
dipped in an aqueous iodine compound solution prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.5 mass% of polyvinyl pyrrolidone iodine (PVPI)<br>
which was an iodine compound in pure water and the test piece<br>
was settled on the anode side and a pure Ti plate was settled<br>
on the cathode side to perform electrolysis at a constant<br>
voltage of 150 V (direct current (DC)) for 5 minutes to cause<br>
electrophoresis, thereby carrying out iodine-impregnation<br>
treatment to impregnate the oxide film formed on the surface<br>
of the test piece with the iodine compound. In the<br>
iodine-impregnation treatment, the initial current density was<br>
about 0.2 A/dm2.<br>
With regard to the test pieces which were only anodically<br>
oxidized and test pieces subjected to iodine-impregnation<br>
treatment after anodically oxidized, an antimicrobial activity<br>
test was made by the film covering method according to the<br>
provisions of JIS Z 2801 to evaluate the antimicrobial activity<br>
of each test piece in the same manner as in Example 2. The method<br>
of evaluation was the same as that of Example 2.<br>
The results obtained are shown in Table 4.<br>
It is found that all Examples of the present invention<br>
exhibit the rate 4 as the antimicrobial activity value, so that<br>
they each keep excellent antimicrobial activity. With regard<br>
to Comparative Examples in which no iodine-impregnation<br>
treatment is performed, the antimicrobial activity value is 0,<br>
that is, these Comparative Examples do not exhibit any<br>
antimicrobial activity.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
Stainless steel (SUS 304) was used as a base material to<br>
manufacture disc-test pieces for antimicrobial test (plate<br>
thickness: 2 mm). These test pieces were first subjected to<br>
shot blasting as mechanical processing treatment of mechanical<br>
treatment. The shot blasting was performed using four types<br>
of alumina shots one by one. In treatment in a first stage,<br>
a #60-mesh alumina shot was used to perform shot blasting under<br>
a pressure of 3.5 kg/cm2 for about 2 minutes carefully from all<br>
directions so as not to leave non-blasted part. Then, in a<br>
second stage, the surface treated by shot blasting using #60<br>
mesh shot was carefully shot-blasted using a #100-mesh alumina<br>
shot in the same pressure and time condition as in the first<br>
stage in such a manner as to be equally shot-blasted. Then,<br>
in a third stage, the surface treated by shot blasting using<br>
#100 mesh shot was carefully shot-blasted using a #150-mesh<br>
alumina shot in the same pressure and time condition as in the<br>
first and second stage in such a manner as to be equally<br>
shot-blasted. Then, in a fourth stage, the surface treated by<br>
shot blasting using #150-mesh shot was shot-blasted using a<br>
#200-mesh alumina shot in the same pressure and time condition<br>
as above. Accordingly, macro unevenness was provided to the<br>
surface of the test piece. The surface roughness in the<br>
shot-blasted state when measured according to the provisions<br>
of JIS B 0601-1994 was as follows: arithmetic average roughness<br>
Ra was 2 fxm, maximum height of roughness profile Ry was 55 \xm<br>
and ten-point height Rz of roughness profile was 3.5 jxm.<br>
Then, the test piece having the surface properties<br>
mentioned above was further subjected to medicine treatment<br>
which was chemical treatment. In this medicine treatment, the<br>
above test piece was treated by dipping the test piece in a<br>
mixture bath containing sulfuric acid (50 g)-oxalic acid (50<br>
g)-water (400 g) at a liquid temperature of 60°C for one hour.<br>
The shot-blasted surface was chemically oxidized into a<br>
micronized etching surface having an oxide film on the surface<br>
thereof. The surface roughness at this time was as follows:<br>
arithmetic average roughness Ra was 2.5 (jm, maximum height of<br>
roughness profile Ry was 65 |xm and ten-point height Rz of<br>
roughness profile was 4.3 (xm.<br>
The obtained test pieces were subjected to a scanning<br>
electron microscope (magnification: 2500 times) to observe the<br>
surface structure of the film (oxide film) formed on the surface<br>
of each test piece, thereby observing the number of micro<br>
unevennesses of the film formed on the surface of each test piece<br>
in the same manner as in Example 2.<br>
Then, a part of the test pieces subjected to these<br>
treatments were thoroughly cleaned with water. Then, the test<br>
piece was dipped in an aqueous iodine compound solution (liquid<br>
temperature: 25°C) prepared by dissolving 0.5 mass% of<br>
P-Cyclodextrin iodine (BCDI) which was an iodine compound in<br>
pure water and the test piece was settled on the anode side and<br>
a pure Ti plate was settled on the cathode side to perform<br>
electrolysis at a constant voltage of 150 V (direct current<br>
(DC)) for 3 minutes to cause electrophoresis, thereby carrying<br>
out iodine-impregnation treatment to electro-deposit the<br>
iodine compound on the micro unevennesses of the oxide film<br>
formed on the surface of the test piece. In the<br>
iodine-impregnation treatment, the initial current density was<br>
about 12 A/dm2 and the current density was decreased gradually<br>
with passage of time.<br>
With regard to the test pieces which were only<br>
mechanically treated and treated using a medicine and test<br>
pieces subjected to iodine-impregnation treatment after<br>
mechanically treated and treated using a medicine, an<br>
antimicrobial activity test was made by the film covering method<br>
according to the provisions of JIS Z 2801 to evaluate the<br>
antimicrobial activity of each test piece in the same manner<br>
as in Example 2. The cells number at the start of the test was<br>
56000/ml (5.6 x 104/ml) . The method of evaluation was the same<br>
as that of Example 2.<br>
The results obtained are shown in Table 5.<br>
It is found that all Examples of the present invention<br>
exhibit the rate 4 as the antimicrobial activity value, so that<br>
they each keep excellent antimicrobial activity. With regard<br>
to Comparative Examples in which no iodine-impregnation<br>
treatment is performed, the antimicrobial activity value is 0,<br>
that is, these Comparative Examples do not exhibit any<br>
antimicrobial activity.<br>
