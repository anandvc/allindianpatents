COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SHADING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
SHADING COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the delivery of pigments and dyes to fabrics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
White clothes are popular among consumers. They are typically made from a variety of fabrics, 100% cotton, polyester-cotton blends (polycotton), 100% polyester, nylon and blends of these fabrics with elastane. On repeated washing and wearing cycles the garments loose whiteness. Methods to maintain whiteness of all garments types made from all fabric types from washing products are desired by consumers.<br>
Shading dyes may be used to maintain and re-invigorate whiteness. Direct and acid, blue and violet dyes show particular utility on cotton garments. Solvent and disperse dyes give benefits on polyester, nylon and elastane containing garments.<br>
In typical washes garments created from 100% cotton, polyester-cotton mixes and 100% polyester are washed together. When acid or direct dyes are used in the washing product to give shading benefits to the 100% cotton garment, the benefits on the polyester-cotton mix garment is lower due to the lower level of cotton. This cannot be compensated<br><br>
for by a higher dye level, as then the 100% cotton garments will become over shaded and appear blue/violet to the eye. Similarly for the solvent and disperse dye for polyester. In this case the situation is worse as these dyes show relatively low deposition onto woven polyester-cotton fabrics compared to nylon-elastane fabrics. Woven polyester-cotton is an important fabric for work and school shirts.<br>
Thus there is a need for a shading system that provides maximum shading whiteness benefits over a range of fabrics, for example 100% cotton and cotton-polyester, most preferably 100% cotton and cotton-polyester, and 100% polyester.<br>
WO2006/032327 discloses that certain organic shading dyes, selected from direct dyes, solvent and disperse dyes, acid dyes and hydrolysed reactive may be used to shade garments.<br>
US20050288207 and WO2005/003274 discloses that basic dyes may be used to shade garments.  WO2006/055787 discloses that dye conjugates may be used to shade garments to give enhanced whiteness. These dyes give effective deposition to certain fibre types, for example direct dyes deposit to cotton fibres very effectively but not to polyester or elastane fibres.<br>
In the art Pigment Violet 23 has been used to colour granule detergent products as disclosed in United States Patents 3,931,037 and 5,529,710. There is no disclosure that laundry products containing organic pigments enhance the whiteness of fabrics washed with them.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
One would expect that a white garment washed in a detergent product that contained a combination of organic pigment with a shading dye would have the same whiteness as the analogous product containing shading dye alone. This is not the case; garments washed in products containing an organic pigment and dye combination have greater whiteness than the product with dye alone.<br>
Furthermore a benefit is provided to both synthetic and cotton fabrics; surprisingly the effective is greatest in the widely used polycotton fabrics, where shading dyes typically show low effects.<br>
We have found that the laundry compositions of the present invention provide shading whiteness benefits over a range of fabrics.  The laundry compositions comprise mixtures of blue and violet organic pigments with direct, acid, reactive dyes, dye conjugates, and disperse and solvent dyes.<br>

Most preferred are disodium 4,4'-bis{[ (4-anilino-6-(N methyl-N-2 hydroxyethyl) amino 1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)]amino}stilbene-2-2' disulfonate, disodium 4,4'-bis{[(4-anilino-6-morpholino-l,3, 5-triazin-2-yl)]amino} stilbene-2-2' disulfonate, and disodium 4,4'-bis(2-sulfoslyryl)biphenyl.<br>
PERFUME<br>
Preferably the composition comprises a perfume. The perfume is preferably in the range from 0.001 to 3 wt %, most preferably 0.1 to 1 wt %. Many suitable examples of perfumes are provided in the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) 1992 International Buyers Guide, published by CFTA Publications and OPD 1993 Chemicals Buyers Directory 80th Annual Edition, published by Schnell Publishing Co.<br>
All compositions are defined with respect to weight percentage unless otherwise specified.<br><br>
EXAMPLES Example 1<br>
Various fabrics were separately washed at 20Â°C, with a liquor to cloth ratio of 30:1 for 30 minutes, in 2g/L of a base washing powder containing 18% NaLAS surfactant, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities. Following the wash, clothes were 2 rinsed twice then dried. The experiment was repeated but with the addition of 5ppm of pigment violet 23. Deposition of the pigment to the cloth was monitored by measuring the % reflectance at 580 nm, R580, and comparing to the analogous cloth washed without the pigment.<br>
The results are shown in the table below and expressed as AR58o where AR58o = R (control) 58o - R(PV23)58o<br>
fabric	ÎR58o<br>
Woven cotton	2.0<br>
Knitted cotton	0.9<br>
Woven 65:35 polycotton	8.0<br>
Knitted 65:35 polycotton	1.5<br>
Woven Polyester	0.6<br>
Knitted polyester	0.3<br>
Woven nylon	0.1<br>
Knitted nylon	-0.5<br>
The pigment shows a strong preference to deposit onto woven polyester cotton (polycotton) fabric.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A mixed load of woven cotton cloth and woven 65:35 polyester:cotton cloth were washed together with a liquor to cloth ratio of 40:1 with 2g/L of the base washing powder of example 1. The weight ratio of pure cotton to polyester-cotton fabric was 7:5. Cloths used did not contain any fluorescer. The wash took 30 minutes at 20Â°C and was followed by two rinses then drying. To the wash was added:<br>
(1)	nothing<br>
(2)	100 ppb Direct violet 9<br>
(3)	2.5 ppm Pigment Violet 23<br>
(4)	100 ppb Direct violet 9+2.5 ppm Pigment Violet 23<br>
After drying the colour of the cloths were measured with a reflectometer and expressed as the CIELAB delta E value relative to the cloths washed without any dye or pigment. The results are given in the table below. Values are the average of 2 experiments.<br>
The higher the delta E value the more shading of the cloth. In (2) the direct violet 9 dye gives a larger shading to the cotton. In (3) the pigment violet 23 give a larger shading to the polycotton. In (4) the combination of dye and pigment gives approximately equal and enhanced shading of both fabrics.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br><br>
Conditions	Cotton	Polycotton<br>
(2)	2.4	1.0<br>
{3)	"        0.7	1.6<br>
(4)	3.5	3.1<br>
Direct violet 9 alone give a AE of 1,0 on polycotton but in combination with Pigment Violet 23 this rises to 3.1.<br>
Example 3<br>
A repeatedly worn and washed 65% polyester: 35% cotton white woven shirt (ex Marks and Spencer UK) was obtained from Equest (Newcastle UK). The shirt was cut into portions and washed 5 times in a base washing powder containing 18% NaLAS surfactant, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities.<br>
Washes were conducted at 20Â°C, with a liquor to cloth ratio of 30:1 for 30 minutes and followed by 2 rinses.<br>
The experiment was repeated with separate shirt portions with various levels of pigment violet 23 added to the wash liquor. After drying the colour of the cloths were measured with a reflectometer ad expressed as the CIELAB delta E value relative to the shirt portion washed without any pigment violet 23. The results are given in the table below.<br>
A clear dose response and build up with repeat washing is found.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br><br>
PV23  I	First	I Second	I Third	I Fourth	I  Fifth<br>
level	Wash	Wash	Wash	Wash	Wash<br>
0.15ppm	1.1	1.3	l.9	2.8	5.9<br>
0.6ppm	2.4	3.2	5.1	8.8<br>
1.2ppm	5.2	7.5	9.8	11.6	15.5<br>
Example 4<br>
Experiment 2 was repeated except the following pigments were added to the wash at a level of 4ppm<br>
(1)	none (control)<br>
(2)	Pigment Blue 15:1<br>
(3)	Pigment Blue 15:3<br>
(4)	Pigment Blue 29<br>
Following drying the reflectance spectra of the clothes were recorded (UV-excluded) and the % reflectance at 570nm measured.<br>
The results are shown in the table below and expressed as ÎR570 where ÎR570 = R (control) 570 - R (Pigment) 570<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br>
Conditions	Cotton	Polycotton<br>
 (2)	2.0	2.5<br>
   (3)	l.2	1.6<br>
(4)                 0.1	0.7<br>
The organic pigments deposit better than the inorganic. All show better deposition onto the polycotton.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
Experiment 2 was repeated using the following dyes and pigments:<br>
(1)	none (control)<br>
(2)	2.5ppm Pigment Violet 2 3<br>
(3)	0.2ppm Acid Blue 98<br>
(4)	2.5ppm Pigment Violet 23 + 0.2ppm Acid Blue 98<br>
Following drying the reflectance spectra of the clothes were<br>
recorded (UV-excluded) and the % reflectance at 570nm<br>
measured.<br>
The results are shown in the table below and expressed as<br>
AR570 where AR570 = R (control) 570 - R (Pigment/dye) 570. Larger<br>
ÎR57o indicates more deposition.<br>
The results are shown in the table below.<br>
Conditions	Cotton	Polycotton<br>
(2)	-0.2	2.9<br>
(3)	3.3	6.8<br>
(4)	3.5	3.5<br>
Acid blue 98 deposits well onto woven cotton, but poorly on woven polycotton. Pigment Violet 23 deposits well onto woven polycotton but poorly onto woven cotton.<br>
The combination of pigment violet 23 and acid blue 98 give good deposition and shading to both fabrics.<br>
Note in the table condition (2) and (3) should be swapped. Acid blue 98 alone gives a AR570 of 0.5 on polycotton, when<br><br>
used in combination with Pigment Violet 23 this rises to 3.5.<br>
Example 6<br>
Various fabrics were separately washed ten times at 20Â°C, with a liquor to cloth ratio of 25:1 for 30 minutes, in 2g/L of a base washing powder containing 18% NaLAS surfactant, 73% salts (silicate, sodium tri-poly-phosphate, sulphate, carbonate), 3% minors including fluorescer and enzymes, remainder impurities. Following the wash, clothes were 2 rinsed twice then dried. The experiment was repeated but with the addition of 3 shading system<br>
(a)	0.0004wt% direct violet 9<br>
(b)	0.003wt% solvent violet 13<br>
(c)	0.0004wt% direct violet 9 + 0.001wt% solvent violet 13 + 0.002wt% pigment violet 23<br>
to the formulation.<br>
The colour of the cloth was measured using a relfectometer<br>
(UV-excluded) and expressed as the CIE LAB values.<br>
The results are shown in the table below and expressed as Ab* = b*(control) - b* (shading), a Îb* greater or equal to 0.3 is taken as significant<br><br>
