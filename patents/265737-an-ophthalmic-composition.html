FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to the treatment or prevention of ocular<br>
conditions. More specifically, the invention is directed to compositions of<br>
alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11 -(1 -methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1 -<br>
b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid, as well as methods for using such<br>
compositions for the treatment or prevention of ocular inflammation and<br>
allergies.<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of a non-provisional filing U.S.<br>
App. Pat. Ser. No. 11/688,016, which claims priority from a provisional filing,<br>
U.S. App. Pat. Ser. No. 60/788185, entitled "Ocular Allergy Treatments," which<br>
was filed on, March 31, 2006.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Allergic disorders of the ocular surface include a wide variety of<br>
pathological conditions including Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis ("SAC"),<br>
Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis ("PAC"), Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis and Atopic<br>
Keratoconjunctivitis. It is estimated that over 20% of the general population<br>
suffer from some form of ocular allergy. Of those, approximately 90% suffer<br>
from either SAC, PAC or both.<br>
The ocular allergic reaction is an IgE-dependent (Type I) hypersensitivity<br>
inflammatory response that most commonly affects adults between 20 and 40<br>
years of age. In susceptible individuals, initial exposure of allergen to the<br>
ocular surface stimulates the production of allergen specific immunologic<br>
antibodies (IgE). IgE then binds to the membrane bound FceR-1 receptor of<br>
naive mast cells in the ocular mucosa. The mast cell is a granulocyte,<br>
containing a number of preformed mediators, including histamine and<br>
proteoglycans. Once the mast cell is activated, newly formed chemical<br>
mediators are formed, which include prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, and<br>
platelet aggregating factor. Subsequent exposure of allergen to the IgE coated<br>
mast cells leads to the release of preformed, as well as newly formed,<br>
mediators contained within the granules of the mast cell.<br><br><br>
The clinical symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include itching, redness,<br>
swelling of the eyelid, chemosis and tearing. Histamine is the primary mediator<br>
in the allergic response. After mast cell degranulation, histamine binds to<br>
receptors located in the conjunctiva. The binding of histamine to H1 receptors<br>
on nerve cells induces itching. Activation of H1 and H2 receptors on the vaso-<br>
endothelium induces vasodilatation and increases vascular permeability<br>
facilitating the migration of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-1α and IL-1 β,<br>
into the blood vessel and the subsequent recruitment of leukocytes into the<br>
conjunctival tissue. Activation of the histamine receptors leads to ocular<br>
hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling and exudation of fluid from blood vessels into<br>
the surrounding tissue, which in turn causes inflammation. The chemotaxis of<br>
leukocytes such as eosinophils and neutrophils into the conjunctival tissue in<br>
turn leads to further tissue damage.<br>
Historically, antihistamines have been the mainstay for treatment of<br>
ocular allergic disease. These therapies vary in potency, specificity and<br>
duration of action. First generation anti-histamines such as pheniramine and<br>
antazoline are known for their rapid onset of action. Unfortunately, these<br>
compounds also cause ocular discomfort and their efficacy diminishes after<br>
only a few hours. Second-generation H1 antagonists such as levocabastine<br>
and emadastine present less ocular discomfort and have a somewhat longer<br>
duration of action. However, these compounds have limited anti-inflammatory<br>
effects, and do little to inhibit the late-phase components of the inflammatory<br>
response.<br>
Currently, the most effective therapies for the management of ocular<br>
allergy are drugs such as olopatadine, ketotifen and azelastine, which have<br>
both anti-histaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties. These therapies are<br>
generally well tolerated and their effects can last up to 8 to 12 hours. Although<br>
reported to be superior to compounds that effect only a single component of the<br>
allergic response, these compounds often fail to provide relief more than one<br>
ocular allergy symptoms.<br>
A drug's affect on ocular redness, chemosis and eyelid swelling offers a<br>
significant improvement over existing therapies. Additionally, since the majority<br>
of newer ophthalmic anti-allergic agents have limited durations of action, twice<br><br><br>
daily dosing is required. A topical preparation with a longer duration of action<br>
will be advantageous because it may be instilled once daily. Thus, new<br>
therapies that can offer advantages in areas such as efficacy and duration of<br>
action, while offering similar safety profiles, are needed. The instant invention<br>
is directed to these and other objectives.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention includes methods of treating or preventing ocular allergy<br>
by administering alcaftadine to the eye of a patient. The inventions described<br>
herein are based at least in part on the surprising discovery that alcaftadine<br>
treats or prevents a number of different symptoms of ocular allergy that make it<br>
especially useful for the treatment or prevention of ocular allergy. The<br>
methods, ophthalmic compositions, and kits of the present invention alleviate<br>
clinical symptoms of ocular allergy and ocular inflammation with minimal<br>
systemic absorption of the active drug. This unusual combination of properties,<br>
together with an excellent safety profile and tolerability when formulated for<br>
topical administration to the eye, makes the drug especially useful for the<br>
treatment or prevention of ocular allergy. Specifically, the invention includes a<br>
method of treating or preventing a clinical symptom of ocular allergy,<br>
comprising administering to the eye of a patient an effective amount of<br>
alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Alcaftadine, also known by the chemical name 6,11 -dihydro-11 -(1 -<br>
methyl-4-piperidinylidene)-5H-imidazo [2,1 -b] [3] benzazepine-3-<br>
carboxaldehyde, has the following chemical formula:<br><br><br>
The compound and methods for its preparation are disclosed in United States.<br>
Patent No. 5,468,743, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
for all purposes. The preferred methods and ophthalmic compositions of the<br>
invention contain the alcaftadine compound of Formula I, but may alternatively<br>
be present as an alcaftadine salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
alcaftadine can be formed from organic and inorganic acids. Suitable acids<br>
include, but are not limited to, acetic, 4-acetamido benzoic acid,<br>
benzenesulfonic, camphorsulfonic, citric, 2,3:4,6-di-0-isopropylidene-2-<br>
keto-L-gulonic acid monohydrate, formic, fumaric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic,<br>
lactic, maleic, L-(-)malic, malic, malonic, mandelic, methanesulfonic,<br>
naphthalenesulfonic, nitric, oxalic, phthalic, phosphoric, propionic,<br>
DL-pyroglutamic, saccharin, salicyclic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, trifluoro acetic,<br>
L-(+)tartaric, and toluenesulfonic acids.<br>
As used herein the terms "ocular allergy" refers to an allergic disorder of<br>
the ocular surface caused by pathogenic allergens. Allergic conjunctivitis is the<br>
preferred ocular allergy and includes a wide variety of pathological conditions<br>
including Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis ("SAC"), Perennial Allergic<br>
Conjunctivitis ("PAC"), Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis and Atopic<br>
Keratoconjunctivitis.<br>
"Clinical symptoms" of ocular allergy include but are not limited to ocular<br>
itching, ocular redness, swelling of the eyelids, chemosis, tearing, and nasal<br>
inflammation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritis and ear/palate<br>
pruritis, and sneezing. It is preferred that the methods of the invention treat or<br>
prevent at least two clinical symptoms, more preferably at least three, even<br>
more preferably more that four. For example, the methods of the invention<br>
treat or prevent at least one of the following clinical symptoms associated with<br>
allergic conjunctivitis ocular itching, ocular redness, chemosis, tearing, swelling<br>
of lid nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. Preferably the methods of the invention<br>
treat or prevent, ocular itching and ocular redness; treat or prevent ocular<br>
itching, ocular redness, and chemosis; treat or prevent ocular itching, ocular<br>
redness, chemosis, and tearing; treat or prevent ocular itching, ocular redness,<br>
chemosis, tearing, and swelling of the lid; treat or prevent ocular itching, ocular<br>
redness, chemosis, tearing, swelling of the lid, and nasal congestion; treat or<br><br>
prevent ocular itching, ocular redness, chemosis, tearing, swelling of the lid,<br>
nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea; treat or prevent nasal congestion and<br>
rhinorrhea.<br>
The term "patient," as used herein, refers to animals, including<br>
mammals, preferably humans. The "effective amount" of alcaftadine, its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates,<br>
polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, is the amount the substance<br>
required to treat or prevent the symptoms of ocular allergy. The effective<br>
amount may vary from patient to patient depending upon the ability of<br>
alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, alone or in combination<br>
with one or more combination drugs to elicit a desired response in the patient.<br>
Other factors determining the effective amount will include, but are not limited<br>
to the disease state or severity of the condition to be alleviated, hormone<br>
levels, age, sex, weight of the patient, the state of being of the patient, and the<br>
severity of the pathological condition being treated, concurrent medication or<br>
special diets then being followed by the particular patient, and other factors<br>
which those ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize, with the appropriate<br>
dosage ultimately being at the discretion of the attending physician. Dosage<br>
regimens may be adjusted to provide the improved therapeutic response. An<br>
effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the<br>
components are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. It is<br>
preferred that for most patients a 50 uL drop of a 0.25% ocular solution<br>
contains 0.125 mg of alcaftadine. Assuming that 100% of drug is systemically<br>
absorbed, a 70 kg person, using the eye drops bilaterally, meaning in each eye,<br>
once daily, would be exposed to a dose of 0.25 mg/d, or 3.57pg/kg per day. It<br>
is reasonable to assume that the actual systemic exposure will be lower, since<br>
it is likely that not all of the amount will be absorbed. It is preferred that the<br>
effective amount of alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-<br>
oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, is<br>
between less than about 0.25 mg and greater than or equal to about 0.015 mg,<br>
more preferably, between about 0.030 mg and about 0.14 mg, more preferably<br>
between about 0.075 mg and about 0.125 mg.<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein refers to<br>
materials that are generally not toxic or injurious to a patient when used with<br>
alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, the present invention,<br>
including when the alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-<br>
oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof,, is<br>
formulated as ophthalmic compositions, as defined herein.<br>
Alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, may be administered to<br>
the patient by any route of administration capable of delivering the drug to the<br>
eye of the patient, in any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. Thus, the<br>
drug may be administered to the patient in the form of an ophthalmic<br>
composition, as defined herein, or any other formulation, device or mechanism<br>
suitable for the short term or long term delivery of an effective amount of the<br>
drug to the patient's eye. The drug may be administered to the patient in an<br>
ophthalmic inserts containing or coated with alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or<br>
mixtures thereof, including but not limited to contact lenses, punctal plugs, or,<br>
ocular inserts. In preferred methods of the present invention, the drug is<br>
administered topically in the form of an ophthalmic composition selected from<br>
the group consisting of ophthalmic solutions or suspensions (i.e., eye drops),<br>
ophthalmic ointments, or ophthalmic gels.<br>
Further, the invention includes a method of treating or preventing a<br>
clinical symptom of ocular inflammation, comprising administering to the eye of<br>
a patient an effective amount of alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures<br>
thereof. The terms alcaftadine, clinical symptom, patient, pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and effective amount all have<br>
their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. The term ocular<br>
inflammation refers to inflammation of any part of the anterior portion of the<br>
eye. Such ocular inflammation may be caused by any of the following or any<br>
combination of the following dry eye, contact lens wear, bacterial infections,<br><br>
fungal infections, or viral infections. The preferred causes of ocular<br>
inflammation are bacterial infections or viral infections.<br>
In addition the invention includes a method of treating or preventing a<br>
mechanistic symptom associated with ocular allergy or ocular inflammation<br>
comprising administering to the eye of a patient an effective amount of<br>
alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof. The terms alcaftadine,<br>
patient pharmaceutically acceptable, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
effective amount, ocular allergy, and ocular inflammation all have their<br>
aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. "Mechanistic symptoms" are<br>
cellular reactions that either elicit or suppress symptoms of a disease state<br>
such as ocular allergy or ocular inflammation. Mechanistic symptoms include<br>
but are not limited to vascular leakage, a reduction in the integrity of the<br>
conjunctival epithelial tight junctions, modulation of them receptor, and mast<br>
cell degradation. The preferred methods of the invention treat or prevent at<br>
least two mechanistic symptoms, more preferably treat or prevent at least three<br>
mechanistic symptoms, even more preferably treat or prevent at least four<br>
mechanistic symptoms. For example the preferred methods treat or prevent<br>
vascular leakage, and a reduction in the integrity of the conjunctival epithelial<br>
tight; treat or prevent vascular leakage, a reduction in the integrity of the<br>
conjunctival epithelial tight junctions, and modulation of theH4 receptor; treat or<br>
prevent vascular leakage, a reduction in the integrity of the conjunctival<br>
epithelial tight junctions, modulation of theH4 receptor, and mast cell<br>
degradation.<br>
Further still, the invention includes a method of treating or preventing a<br>
nasal symptom of ocular allergy, comprising administering to the nose of a<br>
patient an effective amount of alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures<br>
thereof. The terms alcaftadine, patient, pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, ocular allergy, and effective amount all have<br>
their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges. "Nasal symptoms" of<br>
allergy are a subset of clinical symptoms as defined above and include nasal<br><br>
inflammation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritis, and sneezing. The<br>
preferred nasal symptoms are rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.<br>
Alfcaftadine may be administered to the patient in the form of an<br>
ophthalmic composition, as defined herein, or any other formulation, device or<br>
mechanism suitable for the short term or long term delivery of an effective<br>
amount of the drug to the patient's nose, preferably the patient's nostrils. In the<br>
preferred methods of the present invention, alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or<br>
mixtures thereof, is administered to the patient's nostrils topically in the form of<br>
an ophthalmic composition selected from the group consisting of ophthalmic<br>
solutions or suspensions (i.e., nasal drops and spray), ophthalmic ointments, or<br>
ophthalmic gels (as defined herein).<br>
Further the invention includes a method of treating or preventing a<br>
clinical symptom of ocular allergy, comprising administering to the eye of a<br>
patient an ophthalmic composition comprising alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or<br>
mixtures thereof. The terms alcaftadine, clinical symptom, ocular allergy,<br>
patient, pharmaceutically acceptable, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, all<br>
have their aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges.<br>
As used herein the term "ophthalmic composition" refers to any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable formulation, delivery device, mechanism or<br>
system suitable for administration to the eye. The term "ophthalmic<br>
compositions" includes but are not limited to solutions, suspensions, gels,<br>
ointments, contact lenses, implants, sprays, depots or any other type of<br>
formulation, device or mechanism suitable for short term or long term delivery<br>
of alcaftadine, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates,<br>
solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or mixtures thereof, to the eye. In contrast to<br>
oral or injectable formulations, ophthalmic compositions exhibit specific<br>
technical characteristics associated with their application to the eyes, including<br>
the use of pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicles that avoid inducing<br>
various reactions such as, for example, irritation of the conjunctiva and cornea,<br>
closure of the eyelids, secretion of tears and painful reactions. Preferred<br>
ophthalmic compositions according to the invention are advantageously in the<br><br>
form of ophthalmic solutions or suspensions (i.e., eye drops), ophthalmic<br>
ointments, or ophthalmic gels containing alcaftadine, its pharmaceutical<br>
acceptable salts, its N-oxides, hydrates, solvates, polymorphs, pro-drugs, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Depending upon the particular form selected, the<br>
compositions may contain various additives such as buffering agents,<br>
isotonizing agents, solubilizers, preservatives, viscosity-increasing agents,<br>
chelating agents, antioxidizing agents, and pH regulators.<br>
Examples of suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to<br>
chlorobutanol, sodium dehydroacetate, benzalkonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium<br>
chloride, phenethyl alcohol, parahydroxybenzoic acid esters, and<br>
benzethonium chloride. The viscosity-increasing agents may be selected, for<br>
example, from methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
chondroitin sulfate, and salts thereof. Suitable solubilizers include, but are not<br>
limited to, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polysorbate 80, and polyoxyethylene monostearate. Typical<br>
chelating agents include, but are not limited to, sodium edetate citric acid,<br>
stabilizing agents as defined in U.S. App. Pat. No. 60/783,557 filed on, March<br>
17,2006, entitled "Methods for Stabilizing Oxidatively Unstable Pharmaceutical<br>
Compositions" and its corresponding non-provisional filing which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entirety. The stabilizers include, but are not<br>
limited to for example, sodium edetate and sodium hydrogen sulfite.<br>
Useful pH regulators are commonly selected, for example, from sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, citric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
acetic acid, and hydrochloric acid. The pH of the ophthalmic compositions may<br>
range from about 5 to about 8, more preferably from about 6.5 to about 7.5.<br>
Even more preferably, the pH of the ophthalmic compositions is about 7.0.<br>
Useful buffers include, but are not limited to borate buffers, phosphate buffers,<br>
carbonate buffers, and acetate buffers. The concentration of buffer in the<br>
ophthalmic compositions may vary from about 1 mM to about 150 mM or more,<br>
depending on the particular buffer chosen. Preferably, the concentration of<br>
buffer is less than 100, more preferably from about 1 mM to about 25 mM, with<br>
a concentration of about 1 mM to about 20 mM more preferred.<br>
o<br><br>
As used herein, the term "vehicle" is intended to include any carrier,<br>
diluent or excipient suitable for ophthalmic use. "Excipient" refers to an<br>
ingredient that provides one or more of bulk, imparts satisfactory processing<br>
characteristics, helps control the dissolution rate, and otherwise gives<br>
additional desirable characteristics to the compositions. Included within this<br>
term, inter alia, are compounds well known to those of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
as described, for example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients,<br>
(American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C. and Pharmaceutical<br>
Press, London, England, 4th ed. 2003), incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety. In particular, the excipients are selected such that the ophthalmic<br>
composition does not trigger a secretion of tears that will entrain the active<br>
ingredient. Acceptable excipients are well known to a person skilled in the art,<br>
who will know how to select them depending on the desired formulation.<br>
When concentrations, amounts, percentages, and other numerical data<br>
are expressed or presented herein in a range format, it is to be understood that<br>
such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus are to<br>
be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited<br>
as the limits of the range, but also to include each of the individual numerical<br>
values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical<br>
value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a concentration<br>
range of "about 1 weight % to about 10 weight %" is to be interpreted to include<br>
not only the explicitly recited concentration of about 1 weight % to about 10<br>
weight %, but also individual concentrations and the sub-ranges within the<br>
indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual<br>
concentrations such as 2 weight %, 5 weight %, and 8 weight %, and sub-<br>
ranges such as from 1 weight % to 3 weight %, from 5 weight % to 9 weight %<br>
and so forth. As used herein, the term "about" means plus or minus<br>
approximately ten percent of the indicated value, such that "about 50% by<br>
weight" indicates approximately 45% to 55% by weight.<br>
Typically, the concentration of alcaftadine in the ophthalmic<br>
compositions of the present invention will be from about 0.005% by weight to<br>
about 10.0% by weight, with concentrations of from about 0.005 to about 0.4 %<br>
being preferred, and concentrations of about 0.1% to about 0.35% being<br><br>
particularly preferred. A 50 uL drop of a 0.25% ocular solution contains 0.125<br>
mg of alcaftadine. Assuming that 100% of drug is systemically absorbed, a 70<br>
kg person, using the eye drops bilaterally, meaning in each eye, once daily,<br>
would be exposed to a dose of 0.25 mg/d, or 3.57pg/kg per day. It is<br>
reasonable to assume that the actual systemic exposure will be lower, since it<br>
is likely that not all of the amount will be absorbed.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The invention is further demonstrated in the following examples. The examples<br>
are for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example 1: Alcaftadine ophthalmic solutions<br>
Ophthalmic solutions containing alcaftadine were prepared in<br>
accordance with Table I. To assure sterility, the solutions were passed through<br>
0.22 micron sterilizing filter prior to being filled into LDPE bottles that had<br>
previously undergone ethylene oxide sterilization.<br><br><br>
Example 2: Anti-allergic activity<br>
The effect of alcaftadine against acute-phase reactions of allergic<br>
conjunctivitis (edema and erythema) was compared to the effect of other known<br>
anti-allergens in guinea pigs that were systemically sensitized to rabbit skin<br>
squames and topically challenged 17 days later with rabbit allergens.<br>
Anesthetized male albino guinea pigs (Dunkin-Hartley) weighing about<br>
230 to 250 g were injected intramuscularly at the left quadriceps with 50 ul of<br>
purified rabbit allergens. The rabbit allergens consisted of AI(OH)3-adsorbed<br>
rabbit squames (Halab, Brussels, Belgium), which had been homogenized and<br>
washed clean of preservative (0.5% (V7V) phenol) with sterile physiologic<br>
saline.<br>
Alcaftadine was orally administered to each eye in dosages ranging from<br>
0.005 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg at 24 hours and 1 hour before challenge. Other test<br>
compounds included oxatomide, ketotifen, astemizole, cetirizine, loratadine and<br>
terfenadine, administered at dosages of 0.1 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg.<br>
At day 17 post sensitization the left eye was challenged by instilling 25 ul<br>
of 100% normal rabbit serum. At the same time as the allergen challenge, the<br>
right eye was instilled with 25 ul of 1.5 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride (98%,<br>
Sigma) dissolved in deionised, Millipore-filtered water.<br>
Thirty minutes after challenge, edema and erythema were assessed in<br>
the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva of both eyes and scored as absent (0), weak<br><br><br>
(1), moderate (2), severe (3), or very severe (4) by a trained technician.<br>
Alcaftadine significantly alleviated the acute allergic symptoms beginning at<br>
doses of 0.1 mg/kg. In this test, alcaftadine was found to be more potent (on<br>
an equivalent mg/kg basis) than oxatomide, ketotifen and terfenadine and<br>
significantly more potent than astemizole, cetirizine and loratadine.<br>
Example 3: Activity of topical alcaftadine in allergic conjunctivitis<br>
Alcaftadine has been shown to prevent signs and symptoms of allergic<br>
conjunctivitis in a murine model of active anaphylaxis.<br>
Male SWR/J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine), aged<br>
5-7 weeks and weighing between 12.55 and 17.73 grams, were sensitized with<br>
a 100 μl dose of a suspension of 50 ug short ragweed allergen (Greer Labs,<br>
Inc., Lenoir, NC) and 1 mg of aluminum hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,<br>
PA) by intraperitoneal injection at two weeks and prior to treatment and<br>
challenge.<br>
On Day 14, the mice were first given baseline exams to ensure that they<br>
did not present with significant irritation prior to treatment administration and<br>
challenge. The mice were then dosed topically in the eye with an alcaftadine<br>
0.0625% ophthalmic solution, positive control (ophthalmic solution comprising<br>
combination of ketotifen 0.05% and pheniramine 0.5%), or placebo prior to an<br>
ocular challenge with 1.5 mg short ragweed allergen in phosphate buffered<br>
saline.<br>
Fifteen (15) minutes after allergen challenge, mice were evaluated for<br>
clinical signs of allergic conjunctivitis by scoring for conjunctival redness,<br>
chemosis, tearing, and lid edema. Severity of clinical signs was scored by a<br>
trained technician using a standardized 0-2 scale. Alcaftadine was more<br>
effective than the positive control in preventing itching, redness, chemosis and<br>
lid edema, alcaftadine was as effective as the positive control and more<br>
effective than placebo in preventing tearing.<br>
Example 4: Effects of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution in humans-<br>
The anti-allergic effect of a single dose of each of the three concentrations of<br>
alcaftadine ophthalmic solutions from Example 1 was assessed in a<br>
Conjunctival Allergen Challenge ("CAC") performed on adult volunteers with a<br><br>
history of allergic conjunctivitis. Subjects were selected after two visits to<br>
confirm reactivity to the allergen challenge. Subjects qualified for the study if<br>
they had a positive skin test and ocular reaction to at least one of several<br>
common allergens such as cat hair, cat dander, tree pollen, grass pollen, and<br>
the like. Subjects were then challenged with allergen by instilling reconstituted<br>
commercially available allergen into each eye on two separate visits 16 hours<br>
and 15 minutes after the bilateral instillation of alcaftadine, PATANOL®<br>
olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.1% (Alcon, Inc., Forth Worth,<br>
TX) or vehicle, and the clinical response assessed.<br>
Prevention of Ocular Itching<br>
Patients administered alcaftadine 16 hours prior to challenge exhibited a dose-<br>
related inhibition of ocular itching. All concentrations of alcaftadine showed<br>
lower mean itching scores based on subject evaluation using a 5 point scale<br>
(i.e., less itching) than vehicle or PATANOL at 3, 5 and 7 minutes post-<br>
challenge. When challenged 15 minutes post-treatment, the alcaftadine-<br>
treated subjects exhibited a dose-related inhibition of ocular itching as<br>
compared to placebo, and the 0.25% treatment group had lower itching scores<br>
than vehicle or PATANOL.<br>
Prevention of Conjunctival Redness<br>
Patients administered alcaftadine 16 hours prior to challenge also exhibited a<br>
dose-related inhibition of conjunctival redness. Assessments were made at 7,<br>
15 and 20 minutes post challenge based on investigator evaluations of redness<br>
using a 5 point scale. All concentrations of alcaftadine showed various degrees<br>
of reduction in mean conjunctival redness scores at most assessment times.<br>
When challenged at 15 minutes post-treatment, the 0.25% treatment group had<br>
lower scores than vehicle or PATANOL.<br>
Prevention of Nasal Symptoms<br>
Similar results were observed for the prevention of nasal symptoms induced by<br>
CAC. Nasal symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, pruritis (nasal and ear/palate)<br>
and nasal congestion were assessed by subjects using standardized scales.<br><br><br>
All concentrations of alcaftadine showed some degree of relief of nasal<br>
congestion and rhinorrhea at various time points. These numbers often<br>
reached statistical significance versus either placebo and in some instances<br>
active control (p≤ 0.05). Similar results were demonstrated for the parameters<br>
of itching in the nose, palate and ear. No effect on sneezing was demonstrated<br>
in this study; however, baseline sneezing incidence (pre-treatment) was likely<br>
too low to detect a therapeutic effect if one existed. In summary, significant<br>
reduction of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and pruritis of the palate/ear were<br>
seen at majority of timepoints at both onset and duration visits.<br>
Example 5: Effect of Sterilization with Gamma Irradiation<br>
Alcaftadine is susceptible to oxidation and the primary degradation<br>
product has been identified as the N-oxide structure below. The existence of<br>
the N-oxide structures as the primary oxidative degradation peak was<br>
confirmed as having the same HPLC relative retention time as a synthetically<br>
produced N-oxide structures and also confirmed using mass spectroscopy.<br><br>
To investigate the effects of the gamma irradiation process used to sterilize the<br>
LDPE bottles, the chemical stability of alcaftadine was studied using different<br>
lots of bottles, either gamma irradiated or non-sterilized.<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
The following materials were used in this study.<br>
2.5 mg/ml alfactadine solution<br>
Non-sterilized 5 ml LDPE bottles (DUPONT 20-6064) from Bunder Glas<br>
GmbH (Germany)<br>
Non-sterilized 5 ml LDPE bottles (DUPONT 20-6064) from Rexam (France)<br><br>
Sterilized (gamma irradiated at 25 kGy) LDPE bottles (DUPONT 20-6064)<br>
from Bunder Glas GmbH<br>
Scintillation vials - 20 ml clear glass with Teflon coated cap<br>
Millex GV syringe filter unit<br>
Results:<br>
Chemical stability results for alcaftadine solution stored in either non-<br>
sterilized bottles (Rexam or Bunder Glas) or gamma-irradiated bottles (Bunder<br>
Glas) are summarized in Table 2. All samples were assayed by HPLC after 6<br>
and 14 days of storage at 50°C. Light exposure was not controlled during<br>
storage. The solution was stored in either Rexam bottles (without sterilization),<br>
Bunder Glas bottles (sterilized with γ Irradiation or without sterilization) and in<br>
glass vials.<br><br>
"Sample showed significant evaporation, consistent with the higher assay value<br>
observed<br>
Conclusions:<br>
Alcaftadine stored in gamma irradiated Bunder Glas bottles showed<br>
significantly increased levels of N-oxide formation compared with glass vials<br>
and non-sterilized Rexam and Bunder Glas bottles. This data suggests that the<br><br>
gamma irradiation sterilization process may be the primary cause of oxidation<br>
by inducing chemical or physical changes in the polyethylene bottle.<br>
Example 6: Effect of Sterilization with Ethylene Oxide<br>
Both non-sterilized Rexam and Bunder Glas bottles were sterilized using<br>
ethylene oxide. Stability studies were initiated and ethylene oxide levels<br>
determined to be 
test method (ANSI/AAMI/ISO: 10993-7) by AppTec (Marietta, Georgia).<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
The 2.5 mg/ml alcaftadine solution was used in this study. Bottles were<br>
sterilized using ethylene oxide in accordance with the protocol set forth in Table<br>
3:<br><br><br>
Results:<br>
The chemical stability results for alcaftadine stored in ethylene oxide<br>
sterilized Rexam and Bunder Glas bottles are summarized in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Conclusions: Based on 14 days of storage at 50°C under ambient light<br>
conditions, alfactadine has significantly lower N-oxide levels in ethylene oxide<br>
sterilized Bunder Glas bottles than gamma irradiated bottles. In this study, the<br>
amount of N-oxide formation in Rexam bottles is similar to that observed in the<br>
glass vials (0.025% and 0.028%, respectively) and slightly higher in the Bunder<br>
Glas bottles (0.074%) after 14 days of storage at 50°C.<br>
Example 7: Effect of alcaftadine on mast cell degranulation<br>
The cell stabilization potential of alcaftadine was evaluated using the<br>
RBL-CCR1 (Rat Basophil Leukemia- Chemokine Receptor-1) cell line as a way<br>
of investigating its ability to effect mast cell stabilization. The use of basophil<br>
cell lines to assess anti-allergic drugs for cell stabilization potential is well<br>
established. Physiologically, basophils are similar to mast cells, containing<br>
pre-formed inflammatory mediators that are released through a similar<br>
degranulation process involving IgE cross-linking. Because these cell lines are<br>
readily available, they present efficiencies over conducting stabilization assays<br>
in mast cell lines.<br>
Cultured RBL-CCR1 cells were sensitized to anti-DNP IgE. Following<br>
sensitization, cells were treated with various concentrations of alcaftadine or its<br>
major active metabolite (0.083%, 0.0083% and 0.00083%) or ophthalmic<br><br>
vehicle (placebo), and stimulated with DNP and/or MIP-1α( Macrophage<br>
Inflammatory Protein-1 alpha, a degranulation enhancer) to induce<br>
degranulation. A 10x and 100x placebo control solution (ophthalmic vehicle<br>
solution) in D-DEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) was also employed.<br>
Stimulation with DNP-HSA (2,4-Dinitrophenyl hapten conjugated to<br>
Human Serum Albumin) alone and MIP-1α alone did not induce significant<br>
levels of degranulation. However, co-stimulation induced a robust<br>
degranulation response. With all three degranulation stimuli, (DNP-HAS alone,<br>
MIP-1αalone, and co-stimulation) the highest concentration of parent drug,<br>
metabolite, and placebo caused unanticipated and significant degranulation,<br>
In the co-stimulation assay, alcaftadine concentrations of 0.0083% and<br>
0.00083% were superior at cell stabilization compared to co-stimulation control<br>
and negative controls (placebo 10x [vehicle 3.3% in D-MEM] and placebo 100x<br>
[vehicle 0.33% in D-MEM] respectively). This superiority was statistically<br>
significant (p
(1 -methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1 -b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid<br>
(CAS # 147083-93-0) at concentrations of 0.0083% and 0.00083% was also<br>
superior at cell stabilization compared to co-stimulation control and negative<br>
controls (placebo 10x and placebo 100x, respectively). Again, statistical<br>
significance was achieved (p
placebo 10x alone also indicated some stabilization compared to the co-<br>
stimulation control and the effect was statistically significant (p
The addition of the alcaftadine or 6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) enhanced the stabilization effect at the 10x dose level,<br>
demonstrating the positive effect of the test agents at membrane stabilization.<br>
Stabilization was not observed at the 100x dilution level. Overall, the results of<br>
this study suggest the alcaftadine and 6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) are effective membrane stabilizing agents.<br><br>
Example 8: Effect of alcaftadine on human H4 receptor<br>
The pharmacological activity of alcaftadine or 6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-<br>
4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) on the human histamine H4 receptor (H4R) was investigated. The<br>
H4R is the fourth histamine receptor that has been identified and it appears to<br>
be primarily expressed on eosinophils, T cells, dendritic cells, basophils and<br>
mast cells, cell types intimately involved with development and perpetuation of<br>
allergic responses. H4R has been shown to mediate mast cell, eosinophil and<br>
dendritic cell chemotaxis and can effect cytokine production from dendritic cells<br>
and T cells. Antagonists for the receptor are clearly anti-inflammatory in vivo<br>
and are efficacious in animal models of asthma and colitis. Alcaftadine and<br>
6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-<br>
3-carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) were tested using cells transfected with<br>
the receptor for binding to the H4R and for an indication as to whether they<br>
were agonists or antagonists of the receptor.<br>
Alcaftadine and 6,11 -dihydro-11-(1 -methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-<br>
imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) were<br>
prepared at 10 mM in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) for the binding assays<br>
and at 10 mM in Na/K phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for the cellular assays. Cell<br>
pellets from SK-N-MC cells transfected with human H4 receptor were<br>
homogenized in 20 mM Tris-HCI/0.5 mM ethylendediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA) pH 8.0 (TE buffer). Supematants collected after centrifugation at 800 g<br>
were recentrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min. Pellets were re-homogenized in TE<br>
buffer. For competition binding studies, membranes were incubated with 10<br>
nM [3H]histamine with or without test compounds for 45 min at 25 °C. Non-<br>
specific binding was defined with 100 uM cold histamine. Ki values were<br>
calculated based on an experimentally determined Kd value of 5 nM for<br>
[3H]histamine and a ligand concentration of 10 nM according to Cheng and<br>
Prusoff. Seven concentrations of compound were tested spanning 10-11 to 10-5<br>
M with each concentration being run in triplicate. The triplicates were averaged<br>
and an IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) curve was generated. This assay<br>
was run twice and the results are reported as the average of the two runs.SK-<br>
N-MC cell lines were created that express a reporter gene construct and the<br><br>
human H4 receptor full-coding region. The reporter gene was β -galactosidase<br>
under the control of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responsive<br>
elements. Cells were plated in 96-well plates the night before the assay.<br>
Antagonists were added 10 min prior to the addition of histamine, which was<br>
added directly to the cell medium. Forskolin (5 μM final concentration) was<br>
added 10 min after the addition of histamine. Cells were returned to the<br>
incubator for 6 h at 37 °C. The medium was then aspirated and cells were lysed<br>
with 25 μL of 0.1 x assay buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8, 0.2 mM<br>
MgSO4, 0.01 mM MnCl2) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cells<br>
were then incubated for 10 min with 100 μL of 1x assay buffer containing 0.5%<br>
Triton and 40 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Color was developed using 25 μL of 1<br>
mg/mL substrate solution (chlorophenol red β-D-galactopyranoside; Roche<br>
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Color was quantitated on a<br>
microplate reader at absorbance 570 nm. For agonist determination a titration<br>
of compounds from 10-11 to 10-4 M in duplicate were added in the absence of<br>
histamine. The values for the duplicates were averaged and used to calculate<br>
the EC50 (effective concentration 50) for the inhibition of cyclic AMP<br>
production by forskolin. This assay was repeated three times. For antagonist<br>
determination a titration of histamine from 10-10 to 10-3 M was run in duplicate in<br>
the presence of 1.2, 3.7,11, 33, and 100 μM compound. The duplicates were<br>
averaged and the EC50 for histamine at each of the different concentrations of<br>
compound were used for a Schild plot to derived the pA2 values, which are the<br>
negative log of the concentration of compound needed to shift the histamine<br>
EC50 by 2-fold.<br>
The alcaftadine and 6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-<br>
imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) were<br>
tested for their ability to displace [3H]-histamine binding to membranes from SK-<br>
N-MC cells stablely transfected with histamine H4 receptor. Competition with<br>
[3H]-histamine indicates that the compounds can bind to the receptor. The<br>
binding curves showed that alcaftadine binds to the receptor with an average Ki<br>
value of 2.9 μM, whereas 6,11-dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-<br>
imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) does not<br>
bind to the receptor at concentrations up to 10 μM.<br><br>
To test whether alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11 -(1 -methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) were H4 receptor agonists, functional assays were carried out in<br>
SK-N-MC cells transfected with thehuman histamine H4 receptor. The ability of<br>
the compounds to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP increases was assessed. The<br>
results showed that histamine is an agonist of the receptor and causes a dose-<br>
dependent inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP levels. However, neither<br>
alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11-(1 -methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1 -<br>
b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) showed any inhibition<br>
of cAMP levels and therefore neither is an agonist of the H4 receptor at<br>
concentrations up to 100 μM.<br>
To test whether alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11 -(1 -methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) were antagonists of the H4 receptor, the ability of the compounds<br>
shift the EC50 of the histamine inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP increases<br>
was assessed in SK-N-MC cells transfected with the human histamine H4<br>
receptor. The results showed that increasing concentrations of alcaftadine<br>
caused parallel and rightward shifts in the histamine (HA) dose response<br>
curves leading to an increase in the EC50 for histamine modulation of theH4<br>
receptor. This effect indicates that alcaftadine is a competitive antagonist of the<br>
receptor. The x-intercept of the Schild plot gives a pA2 value of 5.6, which<br>
represents the negative log of the concentration of antagonist need to induce a<br>
2-fold shift in the histamine EC50. Theoretically the pA2 value should be equal<br>
to the pKi, which is indeed observed (5.6 versus 5.5). Alcaftadine or 6,11-<br>
dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-<br>
carboxylic acid (CAS # 147083-93-0) did not cause any shift at concentrations<br>
up to 100 μM, which is consistent with its inability to bind to the receptor.<br>
These results indicate that alcaftadine binds to the H4 receptor with an<br>
average Ki value of 2.9 μM. Neither alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11-(1-methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br>
147083-93-0) is an agonist of the H4 receptor at concentrations up to 100 μM.<br>
However, alcaftadine, but not alcaftadine or 6,11 -dihydro-11-(1 -methyl-4-<br>
piperdinylidene)-5H-imidazo[2,1-b][3]benazepine-3-carboxylic acid (CAS #<br><br>
147083-93-0) (up to 100 μM), is an antagonist of the human histamine H4<br>
receptor with a Ki value of 2.9 pM and pA2 value of 5.6.<br>
Example 9: Effects of alcaftadine on the integrity of conjunctival<br>
epithelium<br>
To investigate the ability of alcaftadine to maintain the integrity of<br>
conjunctival epithelium, changes in the expression of the tight junction proteins<br>
ZO-1 and E-cadherin (an induction for E-cadherin and qualitative change-from<br>
focal to diffuse for ZO-1) were evaluated following specific conjunctival allergen<br>
challenge. These changes are associated with an increased permeability of the<br>
conjunctival and other epithelial tissues. This in vivo experiment examined what<br>
effect alcaftadine (topical administration 1 and 2 hours pre-challenge) had on<br>
the modulation of these proteins.<br>
Mice were sensitized with short ragweed (SRW) in aluminum hydroxide<br>
via intraperitoneal administration (Day 0, 7, and 15) and eye drop instillation<br>
(Day 8 and 15). On Day 20, mice were further sensitized with eye drops<br>
containing only SRW. On Day 27, the mice were treated topically with either<br>
5uL alcaftadine or vehicle at 1 and 2 hours prior to challenge. SRW was<br>
instilled topically to both eyes. The expression of these proteins in naive eyes<br>
were also monitored. Changes in the expression of the tight junction proteins<br>
ZO-1 and E-cadherin were observed 1-hour post conjunctival allergen<br>
challenge with SRW. The proteins were detected using FITC-conjugated<br>
monoclonal antibodies specific for ZO-1 and E-cadherin and were visualized by<br>
confocal microscopy (Ziess). Naive eyes were from mice that had not been<br>
sensitized or challenged.<br>
The naive (no challenge and no treatment) ZO-1 and E-cadherin<br>
proteins showed focal qualitative properties. However, comparing this to<br>
vehicle treated proteins, the vehicle treated proteins showed diffuse qualitative<br>
changes. The transition from focal to diffuse staining is associated with<br>
increased permeability of the epithelium. Comparing naive ZO-1 and E-<br>
cadherin proteins with alcaftadine-treated proteins, the results show minimal<br>
difference in qualitative properties. Images of ZO-1 and E-cadherin proteins<br>
showed no or minimal difference between naïve (negative control) and<br><br>
alcaftadine treatment, while there was a clear and distinct difference with<br>
vehicle treatment.<br>
These results suggest alcaftadine maintains the integrity of conjunctival<br>
epithelial tight junctions (typified by focal ZO-1 expression) and inhibits the<br>
induction of E-cadherin expression normally observed following specific<br>
conjunctival allergen challenge.<br>
Example 10: Effect of alcaftadine on vascular leakage and cellular<br>
infiltrates<br>
Allergic inflammation can be separated into two distinct phases, the<br>
early phase and the late phase. The early phase inflammatory response occurs<br>
rapidly following mast cell degranulation and is characterized by vascular<br>
endothelial cell gaping and leakage (i.e. swelling) and itching. The late phase<br>
inflammatory response peaks approximately 24 hours after mast cell<br>
degranulation and is characterized by the appearance of cellular infiltrates<br>
(eosinophils and neutrophils). Both eosinophils and neutrophils are known to<br>
have a profound effect on exponentiating the late phase of the inflammatory<br>
response. Upon arriving at the site of inflammation, these cells release various<br>
peroxidases and other antimicrobial factors that function to kill off invading<br>
pathogens but, in the case of severe or chronic inflammation, damage<br>
surrounding tissues and cause further release of pro-inflammatory mediators.<br>
Alcaftadine ophthalmic solution was evaluated to determine if topical<br>
treatment could reduce early phase and late phase allergic inflammation in a<br>
murine model of allergic conjunctivitis. Evans Blue Dye Leakage was used to<br>
assess the impact on vascular permeability during the early phase<br>
inflammatory response. Conjunctiva was taken at 24 hours, stained, and<br>
assessed for presence of neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration to evaluate late<br>
phase anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
All mice were sensitized with short ragweed (SRW) in aluminum<br>
hydroxide via intraperitoneal administration (Day 0, 7, and 14) and eye drop<br>
instillation (Day 8 and 15). On Day 20, mice were again sensitized with eye<br>
drops of SRW.<br>
On Day 27, two topical administrations of the clinical dose of alcaftadine<br>
2.5 mg/ml or vehicle were instilled at 1 and 2 hours pre-challenge. Alcaftadine<br><br>
and vehicle were administered topically at a 5μL saturating dose as treatment<br>
arms based on a randomization code. The treatment arms were as follows:<br>
1.	Negative Control. Sensitized, No challenge, no treatment (negative<br>
control) (N=12)<br>
2.	Sensitized, Challenge, no treatment (positive control) (N=12)<br>
3.	Sensitized, Challenge, alcaftadine 2.5 mg/ml treatment (N=10)<br>
4.	Sensitized, Challenge, vehicle treatment (N=12)<br>
Vascular leak was determined by means of Evans Blue Dye Extravasation<br>
following allergen challenge for N=6 animals except the alcaftadine treatment<br>
arm, where N=4 animals were sacrificed and tested (two animals died during<br>
the procedure). The treatment groups were compared using T-test and p
was considered to be statistically significant. Dissection was performed on the<br>
remaining animals, N=6 per treatment arm, 24 hours post-conjunctival allergen<br>
challenge (CAC) to assess eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment in the<br>
forniceal area. The tissues were processed either as frozen or plastic blocks<br>
prior to sectioning on a microtome. The numbers of eosinophils and neutrophils<br>
were determined both by light microscopy of Giemsa or H&amp;E stained sections<br>
or by immunohistochemistry using cell specific monoclonal antibodies. The<br>
treatment groups were compared using T-test and p
be statistically significant.<br>
There was no significant difference between the Negative Control (no<br>
challenge group- Group 1) and Challenged but untreated (Group 2) group<br>
However, as expected, there was a numerical difference with Group 2 having<br>
higher scores of vascular leak. There was a significant difference between the<br>
vehicle treatment (Group 4) and alcaftadine treatment (Group 3) (p 
groups with alcaftadine successfully preventing vascular leakage compared to<br>
vehicle. As expected, there was a significant difference between the negative<br>
control (no challenge group-Group 1) and untreated but challenged group<br>
(Group 2). Alcaftadine (Group 3) did not prevent eosinophil or neutrophil<br>
recruitment compared to controls.<br><br>
Regarding vascular leakage, the typical induction of vascular leak was<br>
not observed in Group 2 (Challenged and untreated). However, alcaftadine did<br>
significantly inhibit vascular leak following CAC as compared to mice treated<br>
with vehicle alone. Based on observations from previous studies, the low level<br>
of vascular leak in Group 2 is atypical and is most likely due to experimental<br>
error associated with in vivo experiments. The decreased vascular leak in the<br>
alcaftadine treated animals is supportive of a therapeutic role for alcaftadine in<br>
this conjunctival allergen challenge model.<br>
In the evaluation of eosinophil or neutrophil recruitment, the significant<br>
difference between the negative and positive controls suggests the model<br>
worked as expected. However, at the dose used, alcaftadine does not inhibit<br>
eosinophil or neutrophil recruitment in the late phase response, in the murine<br>
model of allergic conjunctivitis following allergen challenge in sensitized mice.<br>
The results of this study indicate that alcaftadine did significantly inhibit<br>
vascular leak following conjunctival allergen challenge. However, it does not<br>
appear to inhibit eosinophil or neutrophil recruitment in the late phase<br>
response, in the murine model of allergic conjunctivitis following allergen<br>
challenge in sensitized mice.<br>
Example 11: Systemic Levels of Alcaftadine in Patients<br>
Patients were bilaterally dosed with 0.25% ophthalmic solutions of<br>
alcaftadine for seven days. The plasma levels of those patients was assessed<br>
pre-dose, and 0.25, 0.5,1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,12, and 18 hour post medication<br>
instillation on days one and seven. Plasma concentrations of Alcaftadine<br>
reached Cmax rapidly and declined to below the lower limit of quantification<br>
(0.01 ng/mL ) by 3 hours post dosing. Mean Cmax values (highest value<br>
measured at any time point) were quite low, mean of 0.051 ng/mL on Day 1<br>
and 0.060 ng/mL on Day 7; the maximum plasma concentrations were less<br>
than 0.12 ng/mL for all subjects.<br>
