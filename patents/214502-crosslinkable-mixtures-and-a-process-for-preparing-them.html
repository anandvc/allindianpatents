				<td>The present invention relates to crosslinkable mixtures and a process for preparing them.<br>
When using addition crosslinking silicone rubber systems, the problem generally arises that the reactive mixture, once prepared, has a finite rate of curing even at room temperature. This can be a nuisance, in particular when the machines have to be shut down for a relatively long time due to technical difficulties or for other reasons. In this case, reactive silicone rubber mixtures left in the machines crosslink even at room temperature which means that very costly cleansing procedures have to be performed before the process can be started up again.<br>
For this reason, there has long been a market need for addition crosslinking silicone rubber systems which ideally do not cure at room temperature at all and have the highest possible rate of reaction under the processing conditions.<br>
In order to achieve this objective, so-called inhibitors are normally added to the rubber systems. One group of inhibitors comprises organophosphorus compounds. Thus, for example, in DE-A-3 635 236, the use of cyclometallised platinum phosphite complexes for increasing the storage-stability at room temperature is described. The catalyst inhibitor complexes mentioned there do increase the pot life at room temperature, but they have the disadvantage that they are complicated to prepare, which is associated with additional production costs. EP-A-662 490 describes general organophosphorus compounds as inhibitors in addition crosslinking silicone systems. The aliphatic and aromatic phosphines mentioned there, however, have the disadvantage that they cause a clear reduction in the rate of reaction under the processing conditions (T = 120 to  170Â°C). DE-P 19532316.5 describes crosslinkabls addition crosslinking mixtures which contain, in addition to a hydrosilylation catalyst, an organophosphorus compound and an inhibitor. The adjustment described there, using a 2-component system, however, is complicated. Mixtures which are fully inhibited at room temperature and in which there is no effect on the rate of reaction under the conditions of curing with an additive, have not hitherto been disclosed.<br>
There is therefore the object of providing suitable mixtures for lowering the activity of the catalyst at room temperature, even in rapid, addition crosslinking silicone systems, without extending the curing times under the reaction conditions.<br>
In addition, the mixture should be as simple as possible, i.e. it should comprise the smallest possible number of components.<br>
It has now been found, that the problems in addition crosslinking polysiloxane mixtures can be solved if these contain Pt compounds or elemental Pt or any other hydrosilylation catalysing substance and at least one sterically complicated substituted triaryl phosphite of the type described in more detail below. The mode of action of the organophosphorus compound as inhibitor becomes closer to that of an ideal inhibitor (switch function, threshold characteristic) the more sterically complicated is the aromatic group R.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a crosslinkable mixture comprising as components<br>
a)	at   least   one   polysiloxane   which   contains   at   least   two<br>
olefmically or acerylenically unsaturated multiple bonds,<br>
