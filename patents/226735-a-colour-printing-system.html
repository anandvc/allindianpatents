				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a colour printing system as<br>
well as devices and elements useful in that system.<br>
Currently, colour printing is based on the so called<br>
'subtractive primaries' of red, blue and yellow. They are<br>
known as the 'subtractive primaries' because when they are<br>
mixed, in whatever proportion they become darker, light being<br>
absorbed or subtracted.<br>
J. C. Le Blon was among the first to apply the red, yellow,<br>
blue theory to colour printing. In fact he invented the<br>
'Three Primary System', which is still widely in use. He<br>
applied his red, yellow blue theory to printing, producing<br>
fine colour prints in the early part of the 18th century.<br>
Most of the detail was printed first from a blue plate,<br>
followed by a yellow, red and finally a black plate.<br>
The first edition of his work 'Coloritto' published in 1723<br>
described the production and use of multi coloured mezzotint<br>
prints from basic printing inks and registered plates.<br>
The approach developed by Le Blon is still followed today,<br>
vith only minor adaptations. The 'Three Primary' colours in<br>
use are Magenta (red), Cyan (blue) and a mid Yellow. Black is<br>
alSO employed to add detail and delineate form. The use of<br>
these four colours (black is a colour), is known as 'Four<br>
Colour Process Printing'.<br>
The use of the 'Three Primary System' plus black is the<br>
standard in use throughout the printing industry, from desktop<br>
computers to large commercial presses.<br>
However severe limitations are encountered when a wide range<br>
of colours is to be reproduced.<br><br>
According to Mr. A. Porni, founder of Design Art Limited, a<br>
New York based sheeted and web printer specialising in fine<br>
art reproduction. 'Many light, bright and rich colours are<br>
not accurately produced in the four colour process. The pale,<br>
clean lime greens, oranges, pinks and lavenders tend to<br>
reproduce slightly degraded or 'dirty'. Rich, deep<br>
Ultramarine blues and maroon red and purples lack the clear<br>
translucence and richness when made from tint combinations of<br>
process inks'.<br>
Many graphic artists and fine artists wonder why their work<br>
cannot be reproduced satisfactorily by any of the forms of<br>
conventional printing.<br>
Ever since the publication of the work of Le Blon in the 18th<br>
century, it has been generally accepted that 'new' colours are<br>
created when the primaries (red, yellow and blue) are mixed.<br>
That blue and yellow 'make' green, red and yellow 'make'<br>
orange and that blue and red 'make' violet. This belief is<br>
universal and is followed by printers, artists, craft-workers<br>
and all who mix colours for interest or livelihood.<br>
It has led to a search for "purer" primary colours, on the<br>
basis that the 'purer' the primary colour the greater the<br>
range of possible mixes, so that absolutely pure versions of<br>
red, yellow and blue would allow full colour mixing and<br>
printing. Magenta, Cyan and a mid intensity Yellow are felt<br>
to be as close to the 'pure' primaries as possible.<br>
Additional inks can be added to the four process colours in<br>
particalar for certain specialist operations. Pre-mixed<br>
colours produced by companies such as 'Pantone Inc' can be<br>
added to the four process colours to reproduce particular hues<br>
during offset printing for example. This process is however,<br>
expensive, does not add much in the way of luminosity,<br>
additional value or intensity. The inclusion of such colours<br>
can also lead to registration problems.<br><br>
Certain digital printers, such as desktop printers, also now<br>
operate on six colours, they are; magenta, a light magenta,<br>
cyan, a light cyan, yellow and black. Extra finesse is<br>
available in the violet-red and green- blue ranges and<br>
intermixes but the limitations already referred to remain.<br>
In fact, the facility to deliver six differently coloured inks<br>
is widely available in all forms of printing. In the case of<br>
offset printing, this facility has been 'built in' to allow<br>
for additional specialist colours (which are constantly varied<br>
depending on the job) or varnishes etc. to be applied.<br>
Where such additional colours or a varnish are applied, a<br>
common situation is that the four colours used in four colour<br>
process printing, magenta, cyan, yellow and black are applied<br>
with one or two pre-mixed colours supplied by companies such<br>
as Pantone Inc. Alternatively one pre mixed colour and a<br>
varnish might be applied.<br>
However, such machines are typically used only to apply the<br>
magenta, cyan, yellow and black of the four colour printing<br>
process with the other two printing heads inoperative, until<br>
specifically required.<br>
In the case of digital printers, the ability to print six<br>
different colours is fairly common, but the colours selected<br>
are based upon the existing understanding of the colour mixing<br>
process, and therefore, the range of colours achievable is<br>
limitec.<br>
The present, 'Four Colour Process Printing' system together<br>
with its variations, has almost certainly gone as far as is<br>
can go.<br>
In fact, 'primaries' do not exist as far as common<br>
understanding is concerned. All colours-reflect elements of<br>
the entire spectrum. Every red, for example, reflects a<br>
certain amount of red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet<br><br>
in varying degrees . (For the sake of clarity the spectrum is<br>
described here in its simplest form, as the six main colours<br>
normally associated with it, red. orange, green, blue, yellow and<br>
violet.<br>
It pure 'primary' colours did exist they would be of little use<br>
in colour mixing as they would only ever produce a range of dull<br>
neutralised colours, greys and black. A pure red and a pure<br>
blue, for example would simply absorb each other's light when<br>
mixed, leading towards a black.<br>
The applicants have formulated a printing system which extends<br>
the gamut of colours achievable.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a six- or<br>
seven-colour printing system in that a six colour system<br>
comprises a combination of colouring materials, each of a<br>
different colour, which are an orange-red; a violet-red; a<br>
violet blue a green-blue; a green-yellow; and an orange-yellow;<br>
and wherin one of said colours is optonally replaced by black or<br>
white, or wherein any colour other than is optionally replaced by<br><br>
The six colours listed above have been selected for their<br>
'leaning' or 'bias' in order to give a widened range of mixes.<br>
The six colour-types are defined by their bias toward or away<br>
from the 'secondary' colours of orange, green and violet.<br>
As used herein the expression "orange-red" refers to a colour<br>
which when analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of<br>
'quantity' or intensity, red followed by orange and then<br>
violet. The relative quantities or intensities of each colour<br>
can be determined by comparing the areas under the graphs of<br>
reflectance (percent) versus wavelength occupied by the<br>
specified colour.<br>
Similarly the expression "violet-red" refers to a colour which<br>
when analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of<br>
'quantity' or intensity, red followed by violet and then<br>
orange.<br>
The expression "violet-blue" refers to a colour which when<br>
analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of 'quantity' or<br>
intensity, blue followed by violet and then green.<br>
The expression "green-blue" refers to a colour which when<br>
analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of 'quantity' or<br>
intensity, blue followed by green and then violet.<br>
The expression "green-yellow" refers to a colour which when<br>
analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of 'quantity' or<br>
intensity, yellow followed by green and then orange.<br>
The expression "orange-yellow" refers to a colour which when<br>
analysed spectroscopically, reflects in order of 'quantity' or<br>
intensity, yellow followed by orange and then green.<br>
Examples of the spectra from each of the colours 1-6 above are<br>
shown hereinafter in Figure 1. Figure 1A represents an<br>
orange- red, Figure 1B represents a violet-red, Figure 1C<br>
represents a green-blue, Figure 1D represents a violet-blue,<br>
Figure 1E represents an orange-yellow and Figure 1F represents<br><br>
The system of the invention is applicable in all forms of<br>
colour printing including digital, conventional offset or<br>
screen printing or any other conventional form of colour<br>
printing, as well as in colour photocopiers.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the invention provides a method of<br>
producing a colour print, said method comprising printing onto<br>
a substrate, colouring materials of a colour printing system<br>
as described above, in a manner and in a mixture so as to<br>
produce the desired design and colour thereon. Suitable<br>
substrates include paper, fabric such as canvass, plastics,<br>
wood, metal etc. as is conventional in the printing art.<br>
Generally the substrates will comprise paper or fabric.<br>
For high quality results, the full colour system of the<br>
invention is employed. However, this may not be convenient if<br>
only a four or even a two colour press is available.<br>
In this case, it would be possible to produce enhanced<br>
printing by utilising the invention in a four or even a two<br>
colour printing press or system, if this was the only system<br>
available. In this case, it is necessary to select from<br>
amongst the six colours, those most appropriate to a<br>
particular print job.<br>
These could be selected on the basis of an initial scan of the<br>
document to be printed. For some jobs the present arrangement<br>
using Cyan (a green-blue), magenta (a violet-red), a yellow<br>
and black might be the most appropriate. However, in the<br>
majority of cases, alternative arrangements would produce<br>
better quality results, and in this, the selection would be of<br>
at least three of the colours of the system of the invention,<br>
and preferably four of said colours, although in some cases,<br>
black or even white may be the best option for the fourth<br>
colour.<br>
As example, in a job that also required bright violets the<br>
cyan of a conventional system would be changed to a violet-<br><br>
blue. Where bright oranges are required the orange-red would<br>
be used in place of the magenta (violet-red) and the yellow<br>
used would be the orange-yellow.<br>
Interchanging amongst the six hues would be straightforward<br>
and the current time consuming colour management element would<br>
be dramatically reduced. Unless the machine was used to go<br>
onto a different job (requiring another arrangement), without<br>
delay, there would be no additional time spent on wash up etc.<br>
If it was used for another job straight away perhaps only one<br>
or two of the six units would have to be cleaned and the<br>
colour changed.<br>
Where only a two colour press is available, this form of the<br>
invention could be used by applying the documents in two<br>
passes through the press, the first time with two of the<br>
selected colours, and the second with the other two, or with<br>
the third and black or white.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the invention provides a method for<br>
producing a print using a combination of four different inks,<br>
which method comprises scanning a document to be printed,<br>
determining the optimum selection of four colours from amongst<br>
the colours listed as (1)-(6) above as well as black or white<br>
for carrying out the job, and using those four colours in a<br>
conventional two or four colour printing press.<br>
Generally the selection will involve at least three of the<br>
colours listed as (1)-(6) above, together with white or black,<br>
and may preferably include a combination of four of the<br>
colours listed as (1)-(6) above.<br><br>
The six colour types used in the system of the invention are<br>
illustrated in Figure 2 hereinafter, which is known as the<br>
'Colour Bias Wheel'. The six 'colour types' are shown in<br>
arrow form to indicate their various biases.<br>
Where a colour-type points towards a 'secondary' colour it<br>
indicates that it is an efficient reflector of that secondary<br>
colour. In general terms, it will 'leave behind' a high<br>
'quantity' or intensity of the particular secondary colour<br>
when appropriately mixed.<br>
Conversely, where a 'colour type' points away from a secondary<br>
colour it indicates that it is an inefficient 'reflector' of<br>
that secondary colour. Consequently it will 'leave behind' a<br>
small 'quantity' or low intensity of the particular secondary<br>
colour when appropriately mixed. Thus consideration of the<br>
Colour Bias Wheel will allow colours to be mixed appropriately<br>
to achieve the target colour.<br>
For example, referring to the Colour Bias Wheel, a 'violet-<br>
red' is the ideal red to employ when mixing a bright violer<br>
as, after the red, yellow, green, blue and orange content has<br>
been absorbed during the mixing process a strong violet<br>
content will remain.<br>
The same 'violet-red' is also the colour-type to employ when<br>
mixing a dull, greyed orange. The reason for this is that,<br>
whan appropriately mixed it will 'leave behind' its weak<br>
orange 'content'.<br>
To indicate the results that can be predicted when the six<br>
colour types are appropriately mixed, the following will<br>
describe their functions:<br>
1. Violet-red<br>
This reflects red, followed by violet and then orange. It is<br>
therefore particularly useful for producing bright violets and<br>
dull oranges, as well as reds.<br><br>
Typical examples of pigments or dyes which may be used to<br>
produce the violet-red colouring material for use in the<br>
system of the invention include Pigment Violet 19<br>
(Quinacridone Violet), magenta as well as pigments designated<br>
PR2 CIN12310, PR5 CIN12490, PR7 CIN12420, PR23 CIN12355,<br>
PR48.-4 CIN15865:4, and PR122 CIN12370. Pigment Violet 19 is a<br>
transparent, intense pigment, possessing a high violet<br>
content. Magenta, although it carries less violet than<br>
Pigment Violet 19, is already fully established, and would be<br>
suitable for all work which did not require very bright<br>
violets.<br>
The abbreviation "CIN" refers to the colour index number, as<br>
is recognised in the art.<br>
2.	Orange-red<br>
This reflects red followed by orange and then violet. It is<br>
therefore useful in producing bright oranges and dull violets.<br>
Orange-red colouring materials, such as inks, for use in the<br>
system of the invention may be produced for example using<br>
pigment Red 108 (Cadmium Red Light) . This is not transparent<br>
but is able to be thinned to simulate transparency. It is<br>
lightfast with a high orange content. Other possible pigments<br>
include PR4 CIN12085-PR6 CIN12090, PR9 CIN12460-PR48:1<br>
CIN158S5:1, and PR112 CIN12370-PR 188 CIN12467.<br>
3.	Violet-blue<br>
As this reflects blue followed by violet and then green, it is<br>
useful in producing bright violets and dull greens. A typical<br>
violet-blue colouring material for use in the invention are<br>
Pigment Blue 29 (Ultramarine Blue), which is transparent,<br>
intense and possesses a high violet content, as well as PB1<br>
CTN42595:2.<br>
4. Green-blue<br>
As this reflects blue followed by green and then violet, it<br>
will be important in mixing bright greens and dull violets.<br><br>
Pigment Blue 15 (Phthalocyanine Blue), which is transparent,<br>
intense and possesses a high green content, is an example of a<br>
pigment which may be used to colour the green-blue colouring<br>
material of the printing system of the invention. The<br>
standard cyan is an alternative that could be used,<br>
particularly where the greens did not have to be very bright.<br>
Other possible pigments include PB16 CIN74100, PB27 CIN77510<br>
and PB33 CIN77112.<br>
5.	Green-yellow<br>
As a reflector of yellow followed by green and then orange,<br>
this colour will be an important element when mixing bright<br>
greens and dull oranges. An example of a pigment for<br>
producing the green-yellow colouring material of the system of<br>
the invention is Pigment Yellow 3 (Hansa Yellow), a semi<br>
transparent pigment which is lightfast and has a high green<br>
content. Other examples of possible pigments include PY4<br>
CIN11665, PY14 CIN21095, PY31 CIN77103 and PY 53 CIN77788.<br>
6.	Orange-yellow<br>
As a reflector of yellow followed by orange and then green,<br>
this colour will be useful in producing bright oranges and<br>
dull greens. Examples of orange-yellow pigments include<br>
Pigment Yellow 35 (Cadmium Yellow Light), which is not<br>
transparent but, again, is able to be thinned to simulate<br>
transparency. It is lightfast with a high orange content.<br>
Other examples of possible pigments include PY1:1 CIN11680,<br>
PY55 CIN21096, PY83 CIN21108 and PY 95 CIN20034.<br>
Generally speaking, individual colours reflect light in a<br>
particular wavelength range, which is summarised in the<br>
following Table:<br><br>
Colour	Wavelength of light:<br>
Violet	400-440nm<br>
Blue	420-490nm<br>
Green	490-550nm<br><br>
Colour	Wavelength of light<br>
Yellow	550-590nm<br>
Orange	590-620nm<br>
Red	610-630nm<br>
Many factors will influence the actual colouring material that<br>
are employed in any particular instance and the particular<br>
examples listed above are given by way of illustration only.<br>
However, in all cases the 'colour-type' will be the Most<br>
important element in determining the particular pigment or dye<br>
selection.<br>
Using the printing system of the invention, every possible<br>
colour available from conventional 'Four Colour Process'<br>
printing is achievable. In addition however, a number of<br>
improvements are possible. In particular, a wide range of<br>
brighter, 'cleaner' oranges, can be obtained, as well as a<br>
wide range of brighter 'cleaner' violets (including various<br>
pinks, lavenders and purples), a wide range of brighter<br>
'cleaner' greens and a wide range of 'coloured greys'.<br>
In adcition, the system of the invention provides a<br>
particularly good predictability of final mixed colours.<br>
The principal reasons for the widened colour gamut of the<br>
system of the invention is believed to arise for the following<br>
reasons.<br>
In conventional 'Four Colour Process' printing, oranges are<br>
produced from a combination of Magenta and Yellow. Magenta<br>
'leans' or is 'biased' towards violet (a violet-red). The<br>
yellow employed varies between a yellow which is slightly<br>
'biased' towards orange (an orange-yellow) and a yellow which<br>
is slightly 'biased' towards green, a (green-yellow).<br>
If the yellow used is a 'green-yellow' as described above, the<br>
mixed orange will be dull and greyed, because both the violet-<br>
red and the green-yellow are poor 'carriers' of orange. In<br><br>
brighter than the blue violets as they are influenced by the<br>
'extra' violet in the red, but the blue violets do not have<br>
this benefit.<br>
Using the printing system of the invention however, the same<br>
range of mid-intensity violets outlined above will still be<br>
available as the same colour types, (the violet-red and the<br>
green-blue) are still available. However, a range of bright<br>
violets will also be available. They will be bright because<br>
the two colours which are vital for their production, a<br>
violet-red and a violet-blue will now be present. Violet-red<br>
and violet-blue both reflect a 'lot' of violet. The two<br>
'large amounts' of violet left behind after the subtractive<br>
process will ensure the required brightness.<br>
Similar considerations allow a wide range of brighter<br>
'cleaner' greens to be produced using the system of the<br>
invention.<br>
The range of greens available from Four Colour Process varies<br>
depending on the type of yellow in use. A 'mid' yellow,<br>
without a strong bias in either direction (either towards<br>
green or orange) is typical. Such a yellow will only ever<br>
prodace mid-intensity greens as it carries only a moderate<br>
'amount' of green.<br>
If a yellow with a leaning, towards orange is used the greens<br>
cannot be brighter than low-intensity (dull and greyed), as<br>
the yellow will leave very little green 'behind' after the<br>
subtractive process.<br>
In addition to these factors, cyan is not the ideal green-blue<br>
when it comes to the production of bright greens. It is more<br>
of a compromise chosen to give 'reasonably' bright violets and<br>
greens.<br>
In the system of the invention, a green-blue ink, preferably<br>
with a strong leaning towards green is used. A green-blue<br><br>
based on Pigment Blue 15 (Phthalocyanine) would be one option.<br>
As both yellow types, (green-yellow and orange-yellow) would<br>
be in use, the selection of the rich, green bearing yellow<br>
would be automatic. When both the blue and the yellow are<br>
strongly biased towards green, very bright, intense greens<br>
become available.<br>
The traditional printing primaries, magenta, cyan and yellow<br>
can be combined to give reasonable darks but it means printing<br>
all three colours, one onto the other. Because the results<br>
are less than satisfactory, a black ink is also used. The<br>
three primary colours plus black make up the four colours in<br>
conventional Four Colour Process printing.<br>
Black is used to darken colours and to add detail. It is used<br>
to define shadow, middle tone and outline. Too little black<br>
results in a lack of contrast. In essence, when reproducing<br>
an artwork, it is usual to put a black vignette around every<br>
object in an artwork, thus inhibiting or stopping the colour<br>
progression required for the illusion of depth.<br>
However, the use of black 'dirties' colours, limits luminosity<br>
and the gradation of value required to add realistic depth.<br>
Obtaining the correct balance of black to the other three<br>
colours can be very difficult. The printing press operator<br>
usually makes the final decision by eye based on the colour<br>
proofs that have been supplied. The black content is<br>
generally adjusted at the final print stage by controlling the<br>
black ink flow at the print head. Too much black results in<br>
very dull, 'heavy' colours overall, a loss of detail in<br>
shadows or other dark areas and pale greys disappear.<br>
Reproductions of photographs lose dimension and luminosity.<br>
Artwork, paintings etc. lose -depth' through the limited range<br>
of values available.<br>
Generally speaking the system of the invention does not use<br>
black in colour printing. However, colours can be darkened by<br>
adding the complementary colour. For example, yellow would<br><br>
darken violet (and vice versa), green would darken red (and<br>
vice versa) and blue would darken orange (and vice versa) .<br>
The system of the invention suitably uses this approach to<br>
achieve dark colours or near blacks, in a particularly refined<br>
way. For instance, a green-yellow can be used to darken a<br>
red-violet (and vice versa) and an orange-yellow used to<br>
darken blue violet (and vice versa) . A blue-green would<br>
darken an orange-red (and vice versa) and a yellow-green, a<br>
violet-red (and vice versa). Green-blue would be used to<br>
darken a red-orange (and vice versa) and a violet-blue to<br>
deepen a yellow-orange (and vice versa).<br>
As each colour pair approached equal intensity so the<br>
resulting hue would become darker.<br>
A vast range of coloured greys can be automatically obtained<br>
through the efficient mixing of the complementary colours.<br>
Neutrals can also be produced automatically. Colours obtained<br>
without using black will appear to be more luminous and a vast<br>
range of values will be available. The availability of<br>
'luminous', 'clean' colours which can be made to recede in<br>
depth over a wide range of shifting values will enhance the<br>
accuracy of reproduction of all forms of artwork, including<br>
fine art.<br>
In addition, by removing black from the process it will be far<br>
easier to predict the final results. The use of two types of<br>
blue, two types of red and two types of yellow will also aid<br>
predictability to a considerable extent.<br>
Using all six colours of the system of the invention will<br>
therefore be particularly useful in a wide variety of<br>
situations. Black or near black may be mixed from<br>
complementary colours in many situations, for example to<br>
produce say a limited amount of text which accompanies many<br>
pieces of artwork, such as the title of a painting.<br><br>
One of the most important areas as far as accurate colour<br>
reproduction is concerned lies in the reproduction of artwork,<br>
paintings etc. Known as 'Giclee' the practice is becoming<br>
widespread with many companies and individuals reproducing<br>
artwork on specialised papers. The amount of black text<br>
required with this type of work is usually limited to the name<br>
of the painting and the artist. In such cases the black can<br>
be produced using complementary colours of the six colours of<br>
the system of the invention as discussed above.<br>
There may be some occasions however, where the inclusion of<br>
black in the system becomes highly desirable, for example<br>
where large quantities of text are present, for example in the<br>
printing of a colour illustrated book.<br>
The system of the invention may be adapted to take account of<br>
this requirement in one of two ways. First of all, where a<br>
colour work does not require all the six colours of the<br>
system, one of the six colours, which is not required, can be<br>
replaced with black to print the text. Whether or not a<br>
particular colour is going to be required in any particular<br>
case can be determined using a colour scan. If this scan did<br>
not show the need for the use of say the orange-yellow ink,<br>
because the colour work did not require the depiction of<br>
bright oranges, the orange-yellow ink could be replaced with<br>
black ink.<br>
Alternatively, where all six colours are needed for accurate<br>
colour reproduction of a particular work, the black ink can be<br>
added as a further element to the system. In most six colour<br>
printer arrangements, for example in offset printing or in<br>
digital printers, this may not be possible at a single pass,<br>
as the six colours making up the system of the invention will<br>
occupy all available print heads, offset printing plates or<br>
ink containers in the case of digital printers. In such<br>
cases, the colour work could be printed in an initial print<br>
run with the black text applied on a separate printer. This<br><br>
could be a simple one-colour printer. Absolute accuracy of<br>
regxstration is not normally critical where text is concerned.<br>
Similar considerations apply with regard to the use of white<br>
colouring material such as printing ink. when white is added<br>
for example as an ink or pigment, to any hue, it dulls the<br>
colour and makes otherwise transparent inks or paints more<br>
opaque. These qualities lead to tints (lighter versions of a<br>
colour), which are different to an ink or paint made lighter<br>
by allowing the background white to show through thinly<br>
applied or transparent inks or paints. White colouring<br>
material therefore, might be included in a system of the<br>
invention to produce lighter versions of any printable colour.<br>
Modification of a printer to allow it to deliver seven colours<br>
is also possible. In this case, the six colours of the system<br>
of the invention may be supplemented with black to provide<br>
maximal flexibility. Such printers may be novel and form a<br>
further aspect of the invention.<br>
A two or more colour printer would be required where the<br>
finished product (book or similar) required all the six<br>
colours of the system of the invention as well as black text<br>
and a varnish or other specialised finish such as an<br>
application of metallic or fluorescent ink.<br>
Where printing systems used provide for the use of inks which<br>
are individual and interchangeable, one of the colours, if not<br>
required, could be changed for black ink, on a case-by-case<br>
basis.<br>
There may be occasions however, where black is needed in the<br>
reproduction of colour artwork. Again the system of the<br>
invention may be readily modified to accommodate this. As<br>
discussed above, 'soft' blacks are available using the range<br>
of complementary colours present within the system. Where a<br>
particularly dense black is required, over large areas, one of<br>
the six colour types least required may be replaced with a<br><br>
dark, neutralised orange such as Pigment Brown 7, Burnt<br>
Sienna. This is correctly biased to produce a dense 'velvety'<br>
black when mixed with violet-blue, as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
The wavelengths reflected by a dark orange such as Burnt<br>
Sienna are illustrated in Figure 3a, and the wavelengths<br>
reflected violet-blue such as Ultramarine Blue, are<br>
illustrated in Figure 3b. On mixing (Figure 3c), the<br>
subtractive process occurs (Figure 3d) resulting in very<br>
little light being reflected, and so giving the appearance of<br>
a deep black.<br>
Alternatively, for the fullest possible gamut from this<br>
approach, the dark orange could be printed separately, for<br>
example on a seventh printing plate of an offset printing<br>
process. However, the occasions when such very dark blacks<br>
are required will probably be relatively few.<br>
The software required to instruct the printing press can be<br>
developed without difficulty using the conventional methods,<br>
and based upon the consideration of the Bias Wheel as set out<br>
above. Similarly the software required when an original work<br>
is scanned in preparation for digital printing, printing film<br>
or when printing direct from plate, can be readily devised.<br>
Printing devices incorporating the colour system described<br>
above forms a further embodiment of the invention.<br>
With the advent of the computer printer and advances made in<br>
colour copiers, companies operating offset presses have lost a<br>
share of their previous market. In an effort to compensate<br>
for this shortfall many have offered additional facilities<br>
such as the printing of varnishes, metallic inks and<br>
fluorescent inks. These additional facilities have meant that<br>
many pperators have installed printing presses with six print<br>
heads. Such machines are suitable for use in with the system<br>
of the invention. All that will be required for their<br>
conversion will be new software and a different range of<br><br>
printing inks. The combination of an offset printing press<br>
with six printing heads, a combination of printing inks<br>
following the system described above, wherein the press is<br>
programmed to mix said inks to produce a range of target<br>
colours, forms a further aspect of the invention.<br>
In the case of digital printing (desktop printers etc.),<br>
machines already exist which can apply six colours. They also<br>
may be programmed to utilise the system of the invention,<br>
provided only that an appropriate range of inks is included in<br>
the ink cartridges. Such printers, together with the<br>
cartridges for use in the printers form yet further aspects of<br>
the invention. New machines fully adapted to this system may<br>
be developed as the need for improvement in colour<br>
reproduction leads to greater competition.<br>
The system may also be adapted for use in colour photocopiers.<br>
A toner system for a colour photocopier incorporating the<br>
printing system of the invention, together with a colour<br>
photocopier incorporating said toner system forms yet a<br>
further aspect of the invention.<br>
When reproducing works such as artworks in prints, the<br>
existing technology involved in the preparation of printing<br>
film, orinting plates and similar for example for offset<br>
printers may be readily adapted for use with the system of the<br>
invention.<br>
For example, one method of recording the initial image is to<br>
record the image using a digital camera. This is currently<br>
one of the most accurate ways to record colours and these may<br>
be converted into the six subtractive hues of the system of<br>
the invention.<br>
In addition, there are several ways to separate 'warm' and<br>
'cool' dots from a continuous tone photograph.<br><br>
Firstly, the continuous tone photograph can be shot through<br>
filters and a halftone screen or stochastic halftone screen to<br>
separate the halftone dots of red, yellow and blue of the<br>
artwork. The use of a stochastic screen has quality<br>
advantages over a regular halftone screen. The detail<br>
rendition is clean and clear and there is no interference or<br>
moire. The contrast is well defined because the halftones<br>
dots do not overlap and touch. This produces greater detail,<br>
smoother gradation, more values and patterns are not created<br>
by converging screen angles or dot groups. With a stochastic<br>
screen, light and dark areas are achieved by varying the<br>
distance between dots. With either screen the value range of<br>
shadows could be extended to 49% into the middle tone by using<br>
a main exposure and then a flash exposure or a no screen<br>
(bump) light to extend the highlight dots down to 50% middle<br>
tone. Two negatives in register can be used for 'warm' and<br>
'cool' versions of the same basic colour (red, yellow or<br>
blue).<br>
An alternative method is to scan the image into a computer<br>
using a flatbed scanner, drum scanner or similar. A program<br>
such as Adobe Photoshop can be employed for this process.<br>
Adobe Photoshop converts images (or sample points) in the form<br>
of pixels into electronically digitized information. On each<br>
sample point, all six colours are picked up and assigned one<br>
of 256 grey levels. If necessary it is possible to make<br>
adjustments to a single pixel.<br>
The computer takes data in pixel form and converts pixels to<br>
halftone dots using a 150 line (halftone screen). There are<br>
four times more pixels than dots. The pixel information will<br>
determine the size and shape of the dots. The program will<br>
allow the separation of 'warm' and 'cool' colours via the<br>
layers palette, then the curves dialogue box or variations<br>
command box. The dot percentages for each of the six<br>
neqatives can then be defined. After the selection of the dot<br><br>
percentages for each 'warm' and 'cool' colour the negatives<br>
can be burnt onto the six printing plates.<br>
The process of producing printing plates using the system of<br>
the invention can be commenced by using a halftone screen and<br>
filter to separate a picture into six negatives. One negative<br>
is created for each of the six colour types, the two reds, two<br>
blues and two yellows. A process camera, scanner and/or<br>
computer separates the six colour types. A halftone screen is<br>
the photomechanical reproduction of continuous-tone copy in<br>
which gradations of tone are obtained by the relative size and<br>
density of tiny dots produced by photographing through a cross<br>
lined screen. The 'warm' colours, orange-yellow, orange-red<br>
and violet-blue would have reproduction dots of 50% to 99% and<br>
the 'cool' colours, green-yellow, violet-red and green-blue<br>
would have dots of 1% to 49%. The lightest 'cool' colour is<br>
not as light as the darkest 'warm' colour.<br>
The dot percentages are different for each colour reflected by<br>
the picture photographed or scanned. The screen is then<br>
rotated 45 degrees for both blues, 75 degrees for both reds<br>
and 105 degrees for both yellows. This will ensure that there<br>
will be no overlapping at the dot top that could cause a mcire<br>
effect. Using the halftone screen, dot images are burnt for<br>
each colour onto six printing plates.<br>
In Summary, the system of the invention provides a widely<br>
applicable printing system, which allows for much better<br>
colour reproduction over a wider gamut of colours than are<br>
available in conventional colour printing. It does not<br>
require the occasional use of specially mixed, single purpose<br>
hues.<br>
Although it requires the use of specialised software both for<br>
printing, and where appropriate in scanning, and the selection<br>
of suitable inks, printers of all types including pre-existing<br>
printers, may be utilised.<br><br>
