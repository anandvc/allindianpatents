TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A METHOD OF TREATMENT OF FABRICS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br>
563/MUMNP/2003<br>
         30/05/03<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention is concerned with improvements relating to fabric care and in particular to means by which the apparent ageing of clothes can be reduced or retarded.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known that clothes, particularly lower cost and quality clothes, lose dye when washed. Almost everyone who washes a mix of clothes has at some time experienced the detrimental effects of washing a new dyed article with white articles. In simple terms, the dye is transferred from the dyed article to the white articles causing a significant change in their colour. The commonplace solution to this problem is to wash new clothes separately.<br>
Articles which are not new also release dye, but at a reduced rate. For this reason it has been proposed to incorporate various 'dye fixatives', 'dye scavengers' or 'colour-safe' bleaches for dyestuffs in laundry compositions. These have been the subject of intensive and extensive research and variously fix the dye in place, prevent it re-depositing or chemically bleach it so as to overcome the problem of dye transfer in mixed washes.<br>
It is well established that relatively small amounts of dye are released from older garments and that the bulk of dye release occurs in the first wash of a new garment. As will be explained in further detail below, this initial dye loss is seldom noted by users except in incidents of dye transfer.<br>
WO 01/53600 (P&amp;G: 2000) relates to fabric dye protection which is specific to denim. As noted in that specification and otherwise known, denim is a rather unique cloth. First, it is woven from two forms of yarn, one of which is dyed and the other is not. Second, the dyed yarn is typically dyed with indigo and has most of the dye located in the outer fibres of the yarn. This form of dyeing is known as Ying-dyeing' and results in a fabric where the dye is easily removed by abrasion during wear: a process known in the art as 'crocking'. Thus, during wear, the dye<br><br>
becomes detached from the fabric, particularly on the seat, knees and thighs and is then easily extracted during washing.<br>
The characteristic colour loss from denim is thought by some to be a desirable feature. Some may even go so far as to deliberately augment damage to denim goods to make the goods appear 'older'. Others, (according to the applicants of WO 01/53600) see such colour loss as a problem.<br>
WO 01/53600 suggests that this rather specific problem can be overcome by the combined uses of a cationic polymer, a low molecular weight polyamine, crystal growth inhibitor and dye fixing agent to provide protection to denim fabric from dye loss which is primarily due to mechanical loss. This mechanical loss occurs through the normal abrasive destruction of the fabric during wear. The agents proposed to overcome this, apparently bind to the cloth and fix the colour in place and thereby prevent or reduce the appearance of ageing.<br>
The characteristic colour loss of denim, which arises due to its peculiar structure, is somewhat unique. Very few other garments are purposefully ring-dyed so as to encourage colour loss.<br>
Ageing in garments which have not been ring-dyed still presents problems.<br>
As noted above, a large part if not the bulk of, colour loss occurs in the first wash. Despite this, clothes are not generally perceived as 'old' after the first wash. Indeed, the first wash of an article generally produces no appreciable change in appearance to the normal observer. While there may have been a significant change in hue or colour depth, this is simply not perceived without a suitable comparison. Thus, prevention of actual colour loss (by the use of dye transfer inhibitors, dye fixatives etc) is not in itself sufficient to prevent apparent ageing of garments.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
We have determined that the most significant cue for ageing in clothes and other articles is colour loss which is localised rather than general. While an article may lose a significant proportion of its colour overall, this loss is not perceived by the casual spectator unless it is extreme. Whereas any localised colour loss, for example on seams, acts as a strong indication that the article is 'faded'.<br><br>
In addition, we have determined that actual removal of dyestuff is not required for an apparent colour loss to be perceived. On seams and the like, abrasion of the surface is sufficient to produce a modified scattering of light which gives the appearance of loss of dyestuff. In reality, the dyestuff may still be present.<br>
Moreover, we have determined that colour loss during laundering, as opposed to during wear, is a significant source of colour loss.<br>
We have determined that this problem may be overcome by use of an anionic or nonionic lubricant which does not adsorb onto textiles during the washing step of a laundering process comprising both a washing and a rinsing step, to prevent the visible appearance of local colour loss through mechanical damage by the laundering process.<br>
By use of a lubricant in this manner, it is believed that localised abrasion of the articles being washed may be reduced or retarded.<br>
Without wishing to be limited by reference to any theory of operation, it is believed that, when dyed textiles fade, this is, almost without exception, characterised by an increase in the luminance component of the colour. It is known that human ability to perceive small differences in lightness is spatially dependent [M.D. Fairchild, 'Colour Appearance models', Addison Wesley Longman Publishing Co, New York (1998)]. The maximum in sensitivity corresponds to a spatial frequency in the range 2-15 cycles per degree. It just so happens that when a garment (such as a pair of jeans) is viewed at a typical viewing distance, then the laundry-induced faded features tend to fall within this range of spatial frequencies. Thus, relatively small changes in colour can strongly influence the perception of the garment provided that they are localised.<br>
While generalised colour loss may still occur to a significant and easily measurable extent, the perceived effect of this colour loss is greatly reduced when the colour loss is even. The effect of preventing local colour loss is to significantly reduce the degree to which the articles being washed appear visibly aged.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The extent of mechanical damage to articles being laundered will vary with the machine type, conditions and the stage of the wash being considered. Use of low water levels and violent<br><br>
agitation are envisaged to promote damage whereas higher water levels and less violent agitation will reduce damage. Unfortunately, mechanised washing machines and environmental concerns have led to increased agitation and lower water levels.<br>
The degree of agitation and the level of water present vary during the laundry cycle and it is preferable that the lubricant is present in those parts of the cycle which involve low water and/or high agitation.<br>
The lubricants which are especially preferred are polymeric materials,<br>
The in-wash protection is achieved by the use of a material which does not adsorb onto the fabrics being washed. It is believed that this avoids adverse effects on the desirable properties of the fabric once it is in the post-wash dry state. For example there is preferably no stiffening of the fabric, no increased tendency for the fabric to attract and retain soils or stains, no reduction in the breathability or water absorbency characteristics of the fabric.<br>
The lubricants are species which do not carry a cationic charge. It is believed that anionic materials exhibit better performance due to their tendency to form an extended structure.<br>
In order that the invention may be further understood it will be described hereinafter with reference to various preferred features.<br>
Lubricants:<br>
It is possible to define suitable lubricants in several ways.<br>
Preferred lubricants show a reduction of friction on wet cotton. Preferred lubricants in the context of this invention are materials which, when measured using the frictional technique described below and with a solution containing 1 g dm'3 of the material, give an Iwd (index of wet cotton lubrication) greater than 15. Preferably this index is greater than 50 more preferably greater than 75.<br>
Preferred lubricants exhibit particular viscosity properties. A preferred lubricant in the context of this invention is a material which when dissolved at a concentration of 1 g dm3 in water at 25°C<br><br>
gives a solution that has a viscosity greater than 0.05 Pa s when measured at a shear rate of 100 s1.<br>
Suitable lubricants include:<br>
polyacrylate salts with mol wt greater than 100 000 Dalton, preferably greater than 500,000 Dalton;<br>
polyacrylic acids with mol wt greater than 100,000 Dalton, preferably greater than 500,000 Dalton;<br>
polyacrylamides with mol wt greater than 100,000 Dalton preferably greater than 500,000 Dalton; or,<br>
co-polymers of these various acrylic materials.<br>
Also suitable are dextrans, preferably with mol wt greater than 50,000 Dalton and preferably greater than 200,000 Dalton.<br>
Other suitable materials are poly vinyl pyrrolidones with mol wt greater than 100,000 Dalton; polydimethyl siloxanes emulsified in nonionic surfactant; and, dispersions of lightly oxidise polyethylene wax e.g. (Imacol C™ ex Clariant).<br>
It is preferable that the lubricant material is presented together with a textile-compatible carrier. In general, it is preferred that the carrier makes up the bulk of a product for use according to the present invention.<br>
Levels for the polymeric lubricants in compositions for use according to the invention fall in the range 0.05%wt-20%wt, with levels of 0.5-5%wt being preferred. Unless otherwise stated all % values given in this specification are %wt and all ratios are weight ratios.<br>
As these levels of lubricants are relatively low, powders, granules, tablets, liquids and other forms of detergent product can be manufactured by conventional means and the lubricants included in the formulations as appropriate.<br><br>
Surfactants.<br>
If the composition of the present invention is in the form of a typical detergent composition (such as a main wash composition), the textile-compatible carrier may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred textile-compatible carriers that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and nonionic surfactant compounds.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art. Commonly employed materials include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of C8-Ci5; primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly C8-Ci5 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
Nonionic surfactants that may be used include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C8-C2o aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more especially the Q0-C15 primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Non-ethoxylated nonionic surfactants include alkylpolyglycosides, glycerol monoethers, and polyhydroxyamides (glucamide).<br>
Cationic surfactants that may be used include quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula RiR2R3R4N+ X' wherein the R groups are independently hydrocarbyl chains of Ci-C22 length, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a solubilising anion (for example, compounds in which Rx is a C8-C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-Ci0 or C12-Ci4 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters) and pyridinium salts.<br><br>
The total quantity of detergent surfactant in the composition is suitably from 0.1 to 60 wt%, preferably 0.5-55 wt%, more preferably 5-50 wt%.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant (when present) is in the range of from 1 to 50% by weight of the total composition. More preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant is in the range of from 3 to 55% by weight, e.g. 5 to 30% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of nonionic surfactant when present is in the range of from 2 to 25% by weight, more preferably from 5 to 20% by weight.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants may also be used, for example amine oxides or betaines.<br>
Detergency Builders:<br>
The compositions may suitably contain from 10 to 70%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder. Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 50% by weight.<br>
The detergent composition may contain as builder a crystalline aluminosilicate, preferably an alkali metal alumino-silicate, more preferably a sodium alumino-silicate.<br>
The alumino-silicate may generally be incorporated in amounts of from 10 to 70% by weight (anhydrous basis), preferably from 25 to 50%. Alumino-silicates are materials having the general formula:<br><br>
where M is a monovalent cation, preferably sodium. These materials contain some bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g. The preferred sodium alumino-silicates contain 1.5-3.5 Si02 units in the formula above. They can be prepared readily by reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aluminate, as amply described in the literature.<br>
Minor and other components:<br><br>
Other optional and minor ingredients include emulsifiers, electrolytes (for example, sodium chloride or calcium chloride) preferably in the range from 0.01 to 5% by weight, pH buffering agents, and perfumes (preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight).<br>
Further optional ingredients include one or more of non-aqueous solvent, perfume carriers, fluorescers, colourants, hydrotropes, antifoaming agents, enzymes, optical brightening agents, opacifiers, anti-shrinking agents, anti-wrinkle agents, anti-spotting agents, germicides, fungicides, anti-oxidants, UV absorbers (sunscreens), heavy metal sequestrants, chlorine scavengers, dye fixatives, anti-corrosion agents, drape imparting agents, antistatic agents and ironing aids. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>
Product Form and Presentation:<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in the form of a liquid, solid (e.g. powder or tablet), a gel or paste, spray, stick or a foam or mousse. The composition may also be applied to a substrate (e.g. a flexible sheet) or used in a dispenser which can be used in the wash cycle.<br>
Embodiments of the invention which take the form of incorporation and use of lubricants in main wash products are preferred. In such compositions the product form is generally a powder or other particulate form ranging in size from a granulate to a tablet, or a liquid. Liquids according to the present invention may be structured or isotropic.<br>
The fabrics which treated according to the present invention are generally in the form of garments and preferably comprise cellulosic fibres, preferably from 1% to 100% cellulosic fibres (more preferably 5% to 100% cellulosic fibres, most preferably 40% to 100% such as 75% to 100%). When the fabric contains less than 100% cellulosic fibres, the balance comprises other fibres or blends of fibres suitable for use in garments such as polyester or polyamide, for example. Preferably, the cellulosic fibres are of cotton or regenerated cellulose such as viscose.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the composition will be packaged together with instructions for use in a main wash, in an automatic washing machine.<br>
In order that the invention may be further understood it will be described hereinafter with reference to the following non-limiting examples.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 - Eye-Tracking studies:<br>
A pair of black cotton jeans were subjected to 10 repeat wash and dry cycles using the 40'C cotton cycle in a Miele™ front loading automatic washing machine and a 1 hour dry cycle in a Miele™ tumble drier. The jeans were not worn between washes.<br>
These conditions generated a typical pattern of in-wash induced uneven colour fading: specifically a periodic light dark pattern along the double seam of the leg and increased colour fading at the seams of the pocket, fly and waistband. Colour matched digital images were produced of the front and back of the jeans. These images were used as stimulus material in the following experiment to determine how a human observer perceives that a garment has faded.<br>
The subject was seated in front of a computer monitor screen. Below the screen was position a small device which uses an infra red tracking system that, once calibrated, is able to determine in which direction the subject is looking. This can then be transformed to calculate which part of the on-screen image the subject is fixating. This information is recorded for the duration of the experiment so that it is possible to reconstruct the subject's eye movements and, in particular, determine the sequence, location and duration of their fixation at different parts of the on-screen image.<br>
After initial calibration, the subject was informed of their task. This was to look at the on screen image and determine which of the two garments shown had been washed the greater number of times. Initially, they were presented with a blank screen apart from a coloured circle, the fixation point, which they were told to look at. This was then replaced with the image of the front and back of the same pair of jeans. From this point, the subject's eye movements were recorded until they voiced their decision. Two images of the same garment were used to ensure that differences were not sufficiently large that the observers could decide instantly using peripheral vision alone. The experiment was repeated using six different subjects.<br>
The recorded eye-tracks showed that without exception, the great majority of fixations and fixation time was associated with the features of the garment showing uneven rather than even colour fading namely: the seams, fly, pockets and waistband.<br>
Example 2 - Human Sensitivity to Colour Changes:<br><br>
The following experiment was performed to quantify the enhanced sensitivity of human colour change perception to uneven colour change compared to uniform colour change at a spatial frequency corresponding to abrasion induced faded features on washed garments.<br>
Two sets of calibrated colour chips were produced using Adobe Photoshop™ in a calibrated printing set-up. One set of chips consisted of a number of pairs of chips of uniform colour where the colour differed only in its lightness value. The differences covered a range of values. Six series of chips of different hue were used. The second set of chips consisted of the same series except that this time the lighter of the two chips had the light colour superimposed as a band down the centre of the chip on top of the original colour. The width of the band was such that, at the viewing distance, the spatial frequency was 2 cycles per degree. 24 panelists were asked to put each of the series in the two sets into order of increased fading. Their performance was analysed using a Probit™ Statistical Analysis which then gave the 'just noticeable difference' (JND) value for colour fading perception.<br>
The results are tabulated below (Table 1) in terms of CIELAB Delta-E values. (Delta-E represents the magnitude of colour difference). It is clear that while the absolute magnitudes vary with hue, there is a consistent ability of the panelist to discriminate lower levels of colour fading when presented with an unevenly faded sample compared to a uniformly faded sample.<br>
Table 1: 'Just noticeable difference' values for even and uneven fading<br><br>
Example 3 - Correlation Studies:<br><br>
A number of black cotton 'combat' style trousers were washed and dried for various numbers of cycles (between 1 and 10) using a number of different wash protocols (different detergent, drying method, ironing or not). The result of these various processes was to arrive at a wardrobe of clothes all showing different amounts of fading.<br>
An area 10cm x 10cm on the leg of the garments was identified which contained a double stitched seam showing enhanced colour fading and an area of uniform 'background' colour fading. The reflectance spectrum of the background and the seam areas was measured using a Datacolor Spectraflash™ 500 spectrometer.<br>
From these spectra, the CIELAB L* values were calculated for the seam and background areas of each garment. The garments were then presented, one at a time to each of 20 different panellists. The garments were presented in such a way that only the 10x10cm area was visible. The panellists were asked to score the level of fading on a 0 to 100 scale. The average score was calculated for each garment. From the data, two graphs were constructed: a plot of the L* value for the background area of the garment against the panel score; and a plot of the L* value of the seam against the panel score. The correlation coefficient was calculated for each plot.<br>
These are tabulated below in Table 2. It is clear from these values that the lightness of the unevenly faded seam correlates more closely to the panellists' visual assessment of fading than does the lightness value of the evenly faded background fabric.<br>
Table 2:<br>
Correlation between measured lightness and visual assessment<br><br>
Example 4 - Friction Measurements:<br><br>
The coefficient of friction between two pieces of white cotton fabric immersed in a solution of the lubricant material was measured using an Eldredge™ tribometer that had been modified to permit the study of submerged materials,<br>
In summary, the set up consisted of a cylindrical watertight trough, to the bottom of which was affixed a 30 x 8 cm strip of plain, woven, white, non-mercerised 100% cotton sheeting. Above this was located a piece of similar fabric mounted a round a cylindrical holder 1 cm in diameter and 6 cm in length. This was attached to a pivoted arm which could be driven in such a way that the fabric cylinder was placed in contact with the stationery strip with defined normal load and then driven at a controlled velocity along a 6.5 cm length of the strip. Stain gauges on the arm permitted measurement of the frictional force opposing this motion. From the frictional force and the normal load it is possible to calculate the coefficient of friction (u). This measurement can be made for a range of velocities; but for present purposes it is appropriate to choose a sliding velocity of 6 cm s-1.<br>
For the purposes of assessing efficacy of potential lubricant systems, the index of wet cotton lubrication (Iwci) is defined as:<br><br>
where u0 is the coefficient of friction measured by the above method using a solution containing none of the lubrication.<br><br>
