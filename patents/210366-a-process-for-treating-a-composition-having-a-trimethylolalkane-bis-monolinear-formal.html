				<td>TREATMENT OF A COMPOSITION CQMPRISING A TRIMETHYLOLAKANE<br>
BIS-MONOLINEARFORMAL<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 09/324,435 filed June 1,<br>
1999.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a novel process for treating a composition comprising a<br>
trimethylolalkane bis-monolinear formal such as that obtained as a heavy ends residue from<br>
the purification of a crude trimethylolalkane product, to obtain useful compounds.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Trimethylolpropane (TMP) and trimethylolethane (TME) are well-known chemical<br>
commodities used as intermediates in the production of a wide variety of products, e.g.,<br>
varnishes, alkyd and polyester resins, synthetic drying oils, urethane foams and coatings,<br>
silicone lube oils, lactone plasticizers, textile finishes, surfactants, epoxidation products, etc.<br>
TMP and TME are made by reacting one mole of n-butyraldehyde or propionaldehyde<br>
respectively with an amount in excess of 3 moles of formaldehyde in an aqueous medium and<br>
in the presence of an alkaline condensation agent. However, these conditions result in the<br>
formation of not only TMP or TME, but also various higher boiling impurities. Thus it is<br>
necessary to subject the crude TMP or TME product obtained from the reaction to a<br>
purification process including distillation and solvent extraction steps, not only to separate<br>
relatively pure TMP or TME from excess formaldehyde, water, and basic condensation agent,<br>
but also from the higher boiling impurities.<br>
A critical step in the purification process for obtaining relatively pure TMP or TME<br>
from the crude product of the reaction is a vacuum distillation or "flashing" of the bulk of the<br>
TMP or TME produced in the reaction, which is thus removed as a vapor from the higher<br>
boiling impurities remaining behind as a liquid heavy ends residue. While the residue may<br>
still contain some TMP or TME, the percentage of such desirable compound is fairly low and<br>
is difficult to recover economically. Furthermore, several of the high boiling impurities<br>
produced by the reaction in fairly large amounts have only limited commercial value. Thus,<br>
any expedient for treating the heavy ends residue, or any compound present in such residue in<br>
large amount, so as to convert at least a portion of such compound to TMP or TME and/or<br>
other more valuable compounds, would be very desirable.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,076,854 issued February 5,1963 to Klein, discloses the purification<br>
of crude TMP product by a process comprising extracting the reaction liquor with a water<br>
immiscible solvent for TMP, e.g., n-butanol or amyl alcohol, subjecting the extract to further<br>
extraction with water to obtain a re-extract containing TMP contaminated with metal formate<br>
and polyhydric by-products; separating the aqueous re-extract from the stripped solvent,<br>
heating the contaminated TMP with methanol or other lower alkanol and a mineral acid to<br>
convert the metal formate to a salt of the added acid, and further treating the aqueous TMP<br>
re-extract with an acidic cation-exchange resin to remove metal ions from the solution.<br>
British Patent No 1,290,036 discloses a process for removing trimethylpropane<br>
monomethyl formal from a crude TMP product by treating the product with a sulfonic acid<br>
cation exchange resin. The trimethylolpropane monomethyl formal decomposes to form<br>
trimethylolpropane monocyclic formal and methanol.<br>
German Democratic Republic Patent No. 142184 discloses a process for the recovery<br>
of TMP from higher boiling residues comprising adding water and methanol to the residues<br>
such that they contain at least 15 wt.% of water or 10-40 wt.% of methanol, pretreating the<br>
residues with a cation exchange resin to remove traces of condensation agent contained in the<br>
residues, treating the residues under distillation conditions with a highly acidic, highly<br>
crosslinked cation-exchange resin with a polystyrene base, and recovering the TMP formed<br>
by conventional separation means.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As part of the invention disclosed herein, it has been discovered that a major<br>
proportion of the heavy ends residue obtained after removing the bulk of the TMP or TME,<br>
excess formaldehyde, water, and basic condensation agent, is a trimethylolalkane<br>
bis-monolinear formal having the formula,                                                              <br>
where R is ethyl in the case of trimethylolpropane bis-monolinear formal (TMP-BMLF) CA<br>
Index Namel,3-Propanediol, 2,2"-[methylenebis(oxymethylene)]bis[2-ethyl-], CAS No.<br>
[93983-16-5] or methyl in the case of trimethylolethane bis-monolinear formal (TME-BMLF)<br>
CA Index Name 1,3-Propanediol, 2,2"-[methylenebis(oxymethylene)]bis[2-methyl-], CAS<br>
No. [636073-72-5]. Thus, in accordance with the broadest aspect of the invention, a<br>
composition comprising a substantial percentage, e.g., at least about 40 wt.%, of TMP-BMLF<br>
or TME-BMLF, no more than about 5 wt.% of water, and no more than about 0.5 wt.% of<br>
methanol, all percentages based on the total weight of the composition, is contacted with a<br>
strong acid catalyst at an elevated temperature and a sufficient period of time to convert a<br>
significant amount of said TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF to TMP or TME and the<br>
corresponding trimethylolalkane monocyclic formal having the following formula,<br>
where R is ethyl in the case of trimethylolpropane monocyclic formal (TMP-MCF) CA Index<br>
Name l,3-Dioxane-5-methanol, 5-ethyl, CAS No. [5187-23-5] or methyl in the case of<br>
trimethylolethane monocyclic formal (TME-MCF) CA Index Name l,3-Dioxane-5-methanol,<br>
5-methyl, CAS No. [1121-97-7]. The additional TMP and TMP-MCF or TME and<br>
TME-MCF produced by the process have considerably greater value than the TMP-BMLF or<br>
TME-BMLF consumed. In many instances the composition treated is a heavy ends residue<br>
obtained from a crude TMP or TME product in the course of a purification treatment after the<br>
bulk of water, excess formaldehyde, basic condensation agent, and purified TMP or TME<br>
have been separated.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The composition subjected to the acid treatment of this convention will in many<br>
instances contain, for example, at least about 10 wt.%, preferably at least about 20-30 wt.% of<br>
TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF, generally anhydrous to no more than about 5 wt.%, preferably<br>
no more than about 1.0 wt.% of water, and no more than about 0.5 wt.%, preferably no more<br>
than about 0.1 wt.% of methanol. In addition, the composition being treated will usually<br>
contain no more than about 5 wt.%, preferably no more than about 0.6 wt.% of any<br>
compound in free form having an atmospheric boiling below that of water, such as<br>
formaldehyde. The composition is contacted at an elevated temperature, e.g., about 30°C to<br>
about 300°C preferably about 90°C to about 220°C, with a strong acid catalyst, for a period<br>
of time, e.g., of about 2 to about 8 hours, preferably about 1 to about 6 hours, sufficient to<br>
convert a significant amount of the TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF to TMP and TMP-MCF or<br>
TME and TME-MCF respectively.<br>
Any strong acid can be used as a catalyst for the process of the invention. While such<br>
acid may be an inorganic acid such as sulfuric or phosphoric, it is preferred in most instances<br>
to employ an alkanesulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid, an arylsulfonic acid such as<br>
toluenesulfonic acid, or a sulfonated cation-exchange resin in acid form, e.g., a sulfonated<br>
polystyrene-based cation exchange" resin. The amount of acid may vary widely, but is often<br>
in an amount such that the acidity of conversion reaction is in the range, for example,<br>
equivalent to the acidity contributed by the strong acid, less than about 15 wt.% , preferably<br>
about 0.3 to about 1.3 wt.%.<br>
Generally a strong acid is added in sufficient amount to result in a pH range of the<br>
reaction of less than about 4, and preferably between about 2 and 3, purified BMLF has been<br>
found to optimally convert to TMP at about 102°C, pH of about 2.35 in about 4 hours:<br>
As suggested previously, a small amount of water under 5 wt.% may be present in the<br>
composition subjected to the acid treatment of this invention. Furthermore, an additional<br>
amount of water is produced by the conversion of TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF to TMP-MCF<br>
or TME-MCF respectively. Although not necessary to obtain the advantages of the process,<br>
it may be desirable in some instances to keep the amount of water at a lower level than would<br>
ordinarily occur. For this purpose a minor amount, e.g. less than about 15 wt.% preferably<br>
less than about 10 wt% based on the weight of the composition, of a compound which forms<br>
a low boiling azeotrope with water and is substantially immiscible with any of the<br>
components of the composition, may be added prior to the initiation of the reaction. Such<br>
compound is preferably a hydrocarbon, e.g., cyclohexane, toluene or benzene.<br>
As stated, the process of the invention results in the conversion of a significant<br>
amount of the TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF in the initial composition to TMP and TMP-MCF<br>
or TME and TME-MCF respectively. For example, in the case ofTMP, it has been found<br>
that the product resulting from the acid treatment of the process of the invention may contain<br>
at least about 5 wt.%, more TMP-MCF than was present in the initial composition subjected<br>
to such acid treatment, based on the weight of the total composition.<br>
Conversely, for example, the amount of TMP-BMLF in the product was found to be<br>
reduced by at least about 70 wt.%, of that in the initial composition based on the weight of<br>
TMP-BMLF before the acid treatment.<br>
As described previously, the composition subjected to the acid treatment of this<br>
invention will in many instances be obtained as a heavy ends residue from a process for<br>
producing TMP or TME by reaction of n-butyraldehyde or propionaldehyde with<br>
formaldehyde in an aqueous system in the presence of a basic condensation agent such as<br>
sodium hydroxide. Such a residue is obtained from the purification of the product of the<br>
reaction including the following steps: 1) removal of excess formaldehyde; 2) removal of<br>
water; 3) separation of TMP or TME and higher boiling impurities from the liquid being<br>
purified, and the basic condensation agent and, 4) heating the crude TMP under vacuum to<br>
flash off and recover the TMP or TME having a high degree of purity. The remaining residue<br>
is the heavy ends residue containing high boiling impurities contemplated for acid treatment<br>
under this invention.<br>
When the composition being treated is the heavy ends residue from a TMP process as<br>
described previously, such composition usually contains, in addition to TMP-BMLF, TMP in<br>
an amount, e.g. less than about 60 wt.%, typically often about 8 to about 20 wt.%; less than<br>
about 15 wt.%, typically about 7 to about 10 wt.% of di-trimethylpropane (Di-TMP). The<br>
amount of TMP-MCF present in said heavy ends residue is generally lower than the latter<br>
compounds, usually less than about 0.1 wt.% and often non-detectable.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, TMP-MCF or TME-MCF in the<br>
composition resulting from the process of the invention is subjected to a transalcoholysis<br>
reaction with an excess of a monohydric or dihydric alcohol, e.g., containing 1 to about 6<br>
carbon atoms, at an elevated temperature, e.g., about 30°C to about 300°C, in the presence of<br>
an acid catalyst, e.g., any of the same acids disclosed previously in connection with the acid<br>
treatment of TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF, to produce additional TMP or TME and an acetal<br>
by-product which is often commercially desirable. Thus, for example, the TMP-MCF or<br>
TME-MCF in the composition resulting from the acid treatment of the invention may be<br>
reacted with excess methanol to produce additional TMP or TME and methylal, useful as a<br>
solvent, in organic synthesis, in perfumes, in adhesives, etc., while TMP-MCF or TME-MCF<br>
may be reacted with excess ethylene glycol to produce additional TMP or TME and 1,3-<br>
dioxolane, useful as low-boiling solvent and extractant for oils, fats, waxes, dyes and<br>
cellulose derivatives.<br>
In addition to their use an intermediate in transalcoholysis reactions to produce<br>
additional TMP or TME and other useful compounds, TMP-MCF and TME-MCF may be<br>
used to produce useful products by other reactions. Thus, as disclosed in U.S. Patents<br>
4,076,727; 4,207,155 and 4,876,368, acrylate and methacrylate esters of TMP-MCF and<br>
TME-MCF may be prepared which are useful as reactive monomers in the preparation of<br>
coating compositions, plastic films, fibers, plastic coatings and, in particular, as diluents in<br>
various unsaturated systems, especially ultraviolet curable coating compositions.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention. Small amounts of water were<br>
removed from the system utilizing cyclohexane as an azeotroping agent.<br>
Examples 1 and 1A<br>
In Example 1, a round-bottom flask, equipped with an overhead stirrer, Dean Stark<br>
trap with condenser, and a heating system, was charged at ambient temperature with 91.30<br>
grams of a previously analyzed, heavy ends residue obtained from the purification of a crude<br>
TMP product as described hereinbefore, 12.53 grams of cyclohexane, and 0.25 grams of<br>
methanesulfonic acid as a catalyst. The charge was heated to 98°C over a period of 90 min.,<br>
and a sample of product withdrawn and analyzed.<br>
In Example 1 A, the procedure of Example 1 was repeated, except that the charge was<br>
heated to 110°C over a period of 275 min.<br>
The compositions of the initial heavy ends residue feed and the treated compositions<br>
of Examples 1 and 1A in terms of weight percentages of the most significant components<br>
based on the weight of the total composition are shown in Table I.<br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure of Example 1 and 1A was followed, except that the initial charge was<br>
462.00 g of heavy ends residue, 69.19 g of cyclohexane and as catalyst, 69.19 g of sulfonated<br>
acrylic-polystyrene based cation exchange resin in acid form sold as "Amberlyst 36 (dry)" by<br>
Rohm and Haas Co. In employing the solid resin catalyst of this example, the experimental<br>
apparatus was modified as follows: The resin was weighed and poured into a "mesh-wire<br>
stainless steel basket" which was attached to the stirring shaft. This basket was shaped like<br>
an "X" and had four components which were filled with resin. Once filled, the basket was<br>
connected to the overhead stirrer motor. Each side of the "basket" had a length of-7.5 cm, a<br>
width of 4 cm and a depth of 1.5 cm and was made using wire with ~42 mesh size. The<br>
design and use of the basket allowed heavy ends residue to have intimate contact with the<br>
solid acid resin as well as preventing degradation of the solid catalysts due to "grinding" from<br>
the stirrer blade.<br>
The charge was heated from 25 to 99.6°C in 190 min. and kept between 99.5 °C and<br>
99.8"C for an additional period of 180 min. (total heating time 370 min.). The composition of<br>
withdrawn samples at various time intervals and temperatures are shown in Table II. "N/D"<br>
means non-detectable.<br>
Example 3<br>
The procedure of Example 2 was followed, except that the initial charge consisted of<br>
709.43g of heavy ends residue, 96.00g of cyclohexane and as catalyst, 67.35g of sulfonated<br>
acrylic-polystyrene based cation exchange resin in acid form sold as "Amberlyst 35 (dry)" by<br>
Rohm and Haas Co.<br>
The charge was heated from 25°C to 95.7°C in 295 min. and the composition of<br>
withdrawn samples at various time intervals and temperatures are shown in Table III.<br>
Example 4<br>
The procedure of Example 1 was followed, except that the initial charge consisted of<br>
157.85 grams of heavy ends residue, 24.58 grams of cyclohexane, and, as catalyst, 0.86 gram<br>
of a modified toluenesulfonic acid sold as "Witco TX Acid" by Witco Chemical Corp.,<br>
containing 1.0 wt.% of moisture and 2.0 wt.% of sulfuric acid, and having a melting point<br>
under 15°C, a specific gravity at 254"C of 1.30 and an acid number of 330. The charge was<br>
heated from 25 °C to 200°C in 182 min. and the compositions of withdrawn samples at<br>
various time intervals and temperatures are shown in Table IV.<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was followed, except that the initial charge consisted of<br>
186.54 grams of heavy ends residue, 24.82 grams of cyclohexane and 0.92 grams of modified<br>
toluenesulfonic acid catalyst. The charge was heated to 1210C in 138 minutes and kept<br>
between 12TC and 133°C for an additional 265 min. for a total heating time of 403 min. The<br>
composition of withdrawn samples at various time intervals and temperatures are shown in<br>
Table V.<br>
As indicated in the data shown in the foregoing tables of Examples 1-5, an acid<br>
treatment under the conditions of the invention of a heavy ends residue obtained from the<br>
purification of a crude TMP product containing a substantial percentage of TMP-BMLF<br>
results in the conversion of the bulk of the TMP-BMLF to TMP and TMP-MCF. A<br>
corresponding acid treatment of the heavy ends residue obtained from the purification of a<br>
crude TME product results in a similar transformation of the TME-BMLF in such residue to<br>
TME and TME-MCF.<br>
As stated previously, TMP-MCF or TME-MCF in a composition.resulting from the<br>
process of the invention may be subjected to a transalcoholysis reaction wjth an excess of a<br>
monohydric or dihydric alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce additional TMP<br>
or TME and a valuable acetal by-product. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature,<br>
for example, of about 20"C to about 400°C, preferably about 25°C to about 300"C and more<br>
preferably about 35°C to 210°C, and may be carried out for a period, for example, of about 0<br>
to about 300 minutes, preferably about 60 to about 240 minutes.<br>
The monohydric or dihydric alcohol reacted with TMP-MCF or TME-MCF may<br>
contain, for example, 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, such as methanol to produce methylal,<br>
ethylene glycol to produce 1,3-dioxolane, 1-propanol to produce di-1-propoxymethane,<br>
2-propanol to produce di-2-propoxymethane, or 2-bromopropanol to produce<br>
di-2-bromopropoxymethane, each in addition to TMP or TME. As also mentioned<br>
previously, the acid catalyst for this reaction may be any of the strong liquid or solid acid<br>
catalysts disclosed as suitable for catalyzing the reaction between TMP-BMLF or<br>
TME-BMLF to form TMP-MCF or TME-MCF and additional TMP or TME respectively.<br>
The reaction of TMP-MCF with ethylene glycol (EG) to produce 1,3-dioxolane and<br>
additional TMP, for example, proceeds in accordance with the following equation:<br>
The amount of monohydric or dihydric alcohol may be in the range, for example, of<br>
slightly above the stoichiometric amount necessary to react with TMP-MCF or TME-MCF to<br>
produce additional TMP or TME and an acetal by-product, i.e. two moles of a monohydric<br>
alcohol or one mole of a dihydric alcohol per mole of TMP-MCF or TME-MCF, or up to<br>
about 5-20 fold excess above such stoichiometric amount. The actual amount utilized<br>
depends on various factors known to those of skill in the art, for example, the alcohol used,<br>
and concentration of reactants in the process stream, among other factors.<br>
The TMP-MCF or TME-MCF reacted with the monohydric or dihydric alcohol may<br>
be relatively pure material, such as that obtained by further distilling the TMP-MCF or the<br>
TME-MCF containing material obtained by the acid treatment under this invention of the<br>
TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF containing heavy ends residue remaining after the separation of<br>
the bulk of the TMP or TME, excess formaldehyde, water and b"asic condensation agent from<br>
the reaction product of n-butyraldehyde or propionaldehyde with formaldehyde. Such a<br>
conversion of relatively pure TMP-MCF with ethylene glycol (EG) is illustrated in Example<br>
Example 6<br>
To apparatus as described in Examples I and IA was first charged EG (50.5 grams,<br>
0.82 moles), then TMP-MCF (30.25 grams, 0.21 mole) and finally methanesulfonic acid<br>
(MSA) as a 70 wt.% solution (0.13 gram, 0.001 mole). Then the reaction was slowly heated<br>
to about 205°C.<br>
The composition of the initial charge at room temperature (25.5°C) before the addition<br>
of MSA was found by gas chromatography (GC) to be 1.39 wt.% of H2O, 63.59 wt.% of EG<br>
and 36.95 wt.% of TMP-MCF with no detectable quantity of 1,3-dioxolane, TMP or di-TMP.<br>
The temperature and composition of withdrawn samples after the addition of MSA at various<br>
time intervals, in terms of weight percents of the most significant components determined by<br>
GC, are shown in Table VI where "ND" means "not detected."<br>
The reaction solution right after the addition of MSA was colorless. At 150 min. of<br>
reaction time the color of the reaction solution was pale yellow. After 180 min. of reaction,<br>
the Dean Stark Trap (DST) commenced filling up. At 360 min. the reaction solution was<br>
brown.<br>
The Dean Stark Trap (DST) was emptied after 480 min. and the liquid collecting in<br>
the DST formed two phases after 510 min. After completion of the reaction, the reaction<br>
solution was found by GC to contain 0.92 wt.% of H2O, 9.03 wt.% of EG, 3.34 wt.% of<br>
TMP-MCF, 10.59 wt.% of TMP and 0.97 wt.% of di-TMP.<br>
At conclusion, the DST bottom phase weighed 6.72 grams and contained by GC 56.24<br>
wt.% of H2O and 24.56 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane; and the DST top phase weighed 4.28 grams<br>
and contained 3.97 wt.% of H2O and 27.2 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane, while the DST contents<br>
removed after 480 min. reaction time weighed 10.55 grams and contained 13.16 wt.% of H2O<br>
and 78.75 wt.% of 1.3-dioxolane.<br>
Based on the GC analysis the total amount of the 1,3-dioxolane collected was 11.12<br>
grams, (0.15 mole). However, based on the water analysis, the amount of 1,3-dioxolane<br>
produced was 16.21 grams (0.21 mole). This discrepancy can be in part attributed to the<br>
factors used in the GC method. Since there were no other components observed in the gas<br>
chromatogram method, the accountability based on the water analysis is believed to be more<br>
accurate. The amount of TMP left in the reaction mixture at the end of the experiment was<br>
determined to be 2.46 grams, (0.018 mole). However, during the course of producing the<br>
1,3-dioxolane, the amount of TMP was found to be 7.42 grams (0.53 mole). The high<br>
reaction temperatures readily explain the low amount of TMP formed.<br>
Although the TMP-MCF or the TME-MCF for the foregoing transalcoholysis reaction<br>
with a rhonohydric or dihydric alcohol to produce TMP or TME and an acetal by-product, has<br>
been described as obtained by treating the TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF resulting from the<br>
reaction of n-butyraldehyde or propionaldehyde with formaldehyde, to produce TMP or<br>
TME, such TMP-MCF or TME-MCF for the transalcoholysis may in fact be obtained from<br>
any source.<br>
In the course of purifying the TMP or TME containing TMP-MCF or TME-MCF<br>
respectively, obtained as a result of the acid treatment of a TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF<br>
containing residue, a light ends overhead stream is obtained from a distillation finishing<br>
treatment of a crude TMP or TME, such light ends containing some TMP or TME as well as<br>
a minor amount of TMP-MCF or TME-MCF respectively. However, the latter compounds<br>
have been found to be acid washed color forming bodies, i.e., they color the TMP or TME<br>
when the latter are subject to contact with an acid in certain applications. While it is<br>
relatively easy to separate the TMP-MCF or TME-MCF from the TMP or TME by<br>
distillation, this results in some loss of TMP or TME recycled to the system. Thus, in<br>
accordance with another aspect of the invention, the light ends overhead stream is subjected<br>
to a treatment with an excess of monohydric or dihydric alcohol in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst to transalcoholyze at least some of the TMP-MCF or TME-MCF present in the<br>
stream resulting in the formation of additional TMP or TME and a valuable acetal<br>
by-product.<br>
The light ends overhead fraction subjected to the transalcoholysis treatment generally<br>
contains an amount of TMP or TME, for example, about 70 wt.%, preferably about 50 to<br>
about 60 wt.%, and TMP-MCF or TME-MCF in an amount, for example, of about 1-15<br>
wt.% preferably about 2 to about 10 wt.%. The conditions of time and temperature and<br>
examples of suitable acid catalysts are the same as those set out previously for the<br>
transalcoholysis of relatively pure TMP-MCF or TME-MCF. The transalcoholysis of<br>
TMP-MCF in a light ends overhead TMP stream using MSA as catalyst and ethylene glycol<br>
(EG) as reacting alcohol is illustrated in Examples 7 and 8.<br>
Example 7<br>
Apparatus as described in Examples 1 and 1A was charged with 121.9 grams of a<br>
TMP light ends overhead fraction, including 4.15 wt.% of TMP-MCF (5.06 grams, 0.035<br>
mole), 36.55 wt.% of TMP and 0.12 wt.% of H2O, determined by GC, then EG (8.31 grams,<br>
0.13 mole) and finally MSA as a 70% solution (0.201 gram, 0.0002 mole)!<br>
Then, the reaction was slowly heated to about 190"C. The temperature and<br>
composition in terms of weight percents determined by GC of significant components of<br>
samples withdrawn after various time intervals following the addition of MSA, are shown in<br>
Table VII where "ND" means "not detected".<br>
Essentially no 1,3-dioxolane was detected in any of the withdrawn samples. The DS<br>
trap started filling with liquid after 120 min., and the liquid collected after reaction<br>
completion contained 2.55 wt.% of H2O, 5.74 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane which was substantially<br>
all the 1,3-dioxolane produced in the reaction, and less than 0.21 wt.% of EG, as determined<br>
by GC.<br>
At the end of the reaction, based on the water analysis, the amount of 1,3-dioxolane<br>
collected in the DS trap was 1.30 grams (0.018 mole). As in Example 6, the discrepancy<br>
between the GC and water analysis can be in part attributed to the factors used in the GC<br>
method and for similar reasons, the accountability based on the water analysis is believed to<br>
be more accurate. The amount of TMP left in the reaction mixture at the end of the<br>
experiment increased by 1.03 grams.<br>
Example 8<br>
In an attempt to verify and optimize the reaction of the TMP light ends overhead<br>
described in the previous example, with EG, the overhead material was spiked with a<br>
relatively pure TMP-MCF. Apparatus as described in Examples 1 and 1A was charged with<br>
250.0 grams of TMP light ends overhead containing TMP-MCF (10.38 grams, 0.07 mole),<br>
followed by EG (18.10 grams, 0.29 mole) and finally MSA as a 70% solution (0.59 gram,<br>
0.004 mole) and the mixture was slowly heated. When the temperature reached about 150°C<br>
an additional 10.91 grams (0.18 mole) of EG was added and the mixture was then heated to<br>
about 207°C. Results obtained in the manner described in Examples 6 and 7 are shown in<br>
Table VIII.<br>
The DS trap began filling with liquid after about 60 min. of reaction time and the<br>
liquid in the DS trap separated into two phases after about 270 min. Additional EG was<br>
added after about 90 min. of reaction time.<br>
The liquid in the bottom or top phase in the DS trap was withdrawn at various<br>
temperatures between 203 °C and 207°C and its weight and weight percent of 1,3-dioxolane<br>
and H2O determined by GC. Results are shown in Table IX.<br>
Based on the GC analysis, about 3.1 grams (0.04 mole) of 1,3-dioxolane was formed<br>
in this example. The results of Examples 7 and 8 indicate that the process of this invention<br>
for treating light ends overhead is effective in the production of 1,3-dioxolane by-product and<br>
additional TMP indicating a reduction of total TMP-MCF in the system.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of the invention, the previously described acid<br>
treatment of a composition containing a substantial percentage of TMP-BMLF or<br>
TME-BMLF, e.g. heavy ends residue containing TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF, obtained in<br>
the course of producing and purifying TMP or TME by reacting n-butyraldehyde or<br>
propionaldehyde with formaldehyde, is carried out in the presence of a monohydric or<br>
dihydric alcohol to produce a greater amount of additional TMP or TME than would be<br>
obtained by the acid treatment in the absence of the monohydric or dihydric alcohol, and, in<br>
addition, an acetal by-product. In some instances, this process can be substituted for, or used<br>
in conjunction with the previous described and separately carried out acid treatment of the<br>
TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF containing heavy residue in the absence of monohydric or<br>
dihydric alcohol, and the subsequent treatment of a resulting TMP-MCF or the TME-MCF<br>
containing stream with the monohydric or dihydric alcohol.<br>
The TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF containing heavy ends residue and the conditions of<br>
the acid treatment, e.g. time, temperature and nature of the acid catalyst are the same as<br>
described previously for the acid treatment in the absence of a monohydric or dihydric<br>
alcohol, and the nature and amount of excess of the latter alcohol which is added to the heavy<br>
ends residue are the same as described previously as suitable for reaction with TMP-MCF or<br>
the TME-MCF; note that the stoichiometric amounts of alcohol necessary for complete<br>
reaction are at least two moles of a monohydric alcohol or one mole of a dihydric alcohol per<br>
mole of TMP-BMLF or TME-BMLF in the residue.<br>
Examples 9 and 10 illustrate the treatment with ethylene glycol (EG) of a<br>
TMP-BMLF containing heavy ends residue having the composition shown in Table I as<br>
"Initial Feed".<br>
Example 9<br>
Apparatus as described in Examples 1 and 1A was charged first with 404.28 grams of<br>
heavy ends residue, followed by excess EG (48.0 grams, 0.77 mole), and finally by MSA<br>
catalyst as a 70% solution (1.48 gram, 1.08x10-2 mole). Conditions and results obtained in a<br>
manner similar to those given in the previous examples, including weight percents<br>
determined by GC of various components in withdrawn samples, are shown in Table X where<br>
"NR" means "GC analyses not run".<br>
Condensation of liquid in the DST commenced at 237 min. and the total liquid in the<br>
DST at the end of the experiment separated into two phases, no H2O or 1,3-dioxolane was<br>
detected in any of the withdrawn samples and the entire amounts of these compounds are<br>
assumed to have been collected in the DST, the bottom phase of which weighed 12.41 grams<br>
and contained by GC determination 73.59 wt.% of H2O, 9.28 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane, and 2.93<br>
wt.% of TMP-MCF, and the top phase of which weighed 8.69 grams and contained 2.37 wt.%<br>
of H2O, 19.64 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane, and 4.41 wt.% of TMP-MCF.<br>
Example 10<br>
The procedure of Example 9 was generally followed except that the charge was<br>
202.14 grams of heavy residue, followed by excess EG (24 grams, 0.39 moles) and finally<br>
MSA catalyst as a 70% solution (0.74 grams, 5.38X10-3 moles). Prior to the addition of<br>
MSA, at a temperature of 26.7°C, the reaction solution contained, as determined by GC,<br>
22.93 wt.% of EG, 25.71 wt.% of TMP, 4.42 wt.% of di-TMP and 17.75 wt.% of<br>
TMP-BMLF. No TMP-MCF was detected. Conditions and result of the reaction are shown<br>
in Table XI where "ND" means "not detected by GC".<br>
Condensation in the DST commenced at 65 min. and liquid was collecting and<br>
separating into two phases at 185 min. At the conclusion of the reaction, the DST bottom<br>
phase weighed 23.31 grams and contained 10.74 wt.% of 1,3-dioxolane and 3.14 wt.% of<br>
TMP-MCF, while the DST top phase weighed 38.73 grams and contained 25.04 wt.% of<br>
1,3-dioxolane and 2.51 wt.% of TMP-MCF. The results of Examples 9 and 10 show that the<br>
acid-catalyzed treatment of a TMP heavy ends residue containing TMP-BMLF in the<br>
presence of ethylene glycol is effective in producing 1,3-dioxolane by-product and additional<br>
TMP and reducing or eliminating the TMP-BMLF in the residue.<br>
