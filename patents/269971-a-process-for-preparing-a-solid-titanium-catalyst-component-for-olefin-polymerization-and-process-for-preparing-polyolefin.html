In the examples, the composition of titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid "was determined by measuring the hydrocarbon separated by using a device shown in Fig. 2<br>
by gas chromatography.  To calculate the purity of the titanium tetrachloride, the weight of the titanium tetrachloride was found by decreasing the weight of hydrocarbor ~rom the weight of the titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid. is a schematic view showing a device used for measuring the composition of titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid, wherein I represents a condenser, 2 represents a round flask,- 3 represents ice water, 4 represents a coolant circulating pump, 5 represents Peristar pump, and 6 represents a stirrer.<br>

the round flask.<br>
(3)	As shown in Fig. 2, the flask was joined with a<br>
condenser, and cooled by ice water.<br>
(4)	A coolant circulating pump was turned on to circulate<br>
the ice water inside the condenser.<br>

turned on to commence the dropping of a pure water at the<br>
rate of 2 ml/min.  (SPEED = x 15, CONTROL = 3-5, POWER = R)<br>
(6)	During the dropping of water, a yellowish brown solid<br>
was produced.  In such a situation, a stirring operation<br>
 condenser held by.hand.  (The stirring operation may be<br>
carried out by a stirrer set to the device.)<br>
(7)	While the dropping of water was continued, the solid<br>
was dissolved to be a clouded liquid.  When the cloud of<br>
the liquid was disappeared, the reaction was completed.<br>
(8)	After   content of the round flask was introduced to<br>
a 100-ml separatoi ;f funnel A, 10 ml of toluene used for<br>
washing the inside of the round flask was also introduced<br>
to the separatory funnel A.<br>
(9)	The separatory funnel A was shaken and allowed to<br>
stand for separation, and then an aqueous phase was<br>
introduced to another separatory funnel B and a toluene<br>
phase was introduced to a 50-ml measuring flask.<br>
(10)	10 ml of toluene was charged into the separatory<br>
funnel A to wash the inside thereof, and then introduced to<br>
the separatory funnel B to be shaken.<br>
(11)	After the separatory funnel B was allowed to stand for<br>
separation, a toluene phase was introduced to the 50-ml<br>
measuring flask formerly charged with toluene.<br>
(12)	About 0.5 ml of p-xylene was added to the 50-ml<br>
measuring flask charged with toluene, and measurement by<br>
gas chromatography was conducted under the following<br>
conditions.<br>

To a 0.5-m3 reactor were charged 98.5 kg of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, 78.3 kg of decane and 24 kg of magnesium chloride to give a homogeneous solution at 140°C. Then, 5.6 kg of phthalic anhydride was introduced thereto, and followed by cooling to room temperature to obtain a liquid magnesium compound (m-1).<br>
To a 1-m3 reactor was charged 0.3 m3 of a titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid (1) having the composition shown in Table 1. After lowering the temperature to -20°C,<br>
103.2 kg of the magnesium compound (m-1) was introduced thereto.  This titanium tetrachloride mixture liquid (1) was obtained by distilling the hydrocarbon containing the titanium tetrachlor;id.e stored in a storage tank (D) which<br>
will be described below(    the condition that the bottom temperature was 67.5°C, the top temperature was 52.0°C, the top pressure was 50 Torr, and the reflux rate was 500.1 kg/hour<br>
When the introduction was completed, the temperature of the mixture was raised to 110°C, 8.8 kg of diisobutylphthalate was introduced thereto, and the mixture was kept for 2 hours for reaction.  When the reaction was completed, a liquid phase was extracted and stored in the storage tank (D) , and a solid phase was transferred to the filter by pressure of nitrogen gas and filtered.<br>
To the solid obtained by the filtration, a small quantity of titanium tetrachloride was added, and the mixture was fed into a 1-m3 reactor by pressure to obtain 0.4 m3 of the titanium tetrachroride mixture liquid (1) having the composition shown in Table 1 .<br>
In the above, the filer was kept at 100°C, and the pressure-feeding line which connects the filter with the 1-m3 reactor was kept at 90°C.<br>
- The inside temperature of the 1-m3 reactor was raised -to 110°C, and kept for 20 minutes.  A liquid phase was fed to the filter by pressure in the same manner as described above, and filtered.  The solid 'obtained by the filtration<br>
was fed into the 1-m3 reactor by pressure, washed three times with 0.4 m3 of hexane of 60°C, and then washed thoroughly with hexane of room temperature until no titanium was detected in the si .-fnitant liquid.<br>
The thus obtained solid was drifJ with a paddle dryer to obtain a solid titanium catalyst component (A-l) having the composition shown in Table 2.<br>
