COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[Section 10]<br><br>

'OIL-GAS SEPARATING DEVICE FOR BLOW-BY GAS'<br>
(a)	SANYANG INDUSTRY CO., LTD.<br>
(b)	184 Keng Tzu Kou, Shang Keng Village, Hsin Fong Shiang, Hsinchu County, Taiwan R. O. C.<br>
(c)	Taiwan R. O. C.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
4-9-2006<br><br>
The present invention relates to an oil-gas separating device, and in particular to an oil-gas separating device used in an engine for blow-by gas.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The blow-by gas comes from three sources as follows.<br>
The fuel gas leaking into the crank case through the clearance between the piston ring and cylinder wall during the compression and combustion strokes, Gas leaking from the inlet manifold and exhaust manifold during the exhaust stroke, or<br>
Oil vapor created in the crank case due to high speed spray for lubrication or heating by engine.<br>
According to environment protection laws, blow-by gas cannot exhaust directly to atmosphere, therefore, a device is required for dealing with the blow-by gas.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of an engine assembly. A piston 110 is mounted inside a cylinder 111 and is movable therein; a spark plug 109 and a cylinder head 101 are mounted on the top of the cylinder 111; the piston 110 is connected to a crank shaft 108 mounted in the left and<br>
2<br><br>
right crank case 105 - 104. The power output from crank shaft 108 is transmitted to a rear wheel 112 through a transmission mechanism. Moreover, a Positive Crank case Ventilation (PCV) valve assembly 103 is mounted on the top of the cylinder head 101.<br>
Referring to Fig.2, a cam shaft 113 extends over the spark plug 109. A cam timing sprocket 114 is mounted on the left portion of the cam shaft 113 and connects to the crank shaft 108 (shown in fig.l) with a chain (not shown in the figure). A centrifugal disk 115 is secured on the left end of the cam shaft 113. An oil-gas separating device for blow-by gas 102(oil-gas separating device hereinafter) mounted on the left side of the cylinder head 101 comprises an oil-gas separating cover 1021, an oil-gas collecting plate 1022, a screw 1023, an O-ring 1027 and a front oil-gas collecting plate 1028.<br>
As shown in Fig.3, oil drops condense on the oil-gas collecting plate 1022 and the front oil-gas collecting plate 1028, and then drain into the crank case directly or through a drain hole (not shown in the figure). The uncondensed oil-gas discharges into the inlet portion of the fuel supply system, and then flows into the engine for re-ignition.<br>
3<br><br>
In spite of the conventional oil-gas separating device's performance, however, it comprises 5 components as described above, resulting in higher costs and more assemble time. Moreover, the more components a device comprises, more possibly shortening the life of components and making more noise during operation the vibration occurs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide an oil-gas separating device for blow-by gas (oil-gas separating device hereafter) comprising fewer components and easier assembly.<br>
The oil-gas separating device in the invention mainly comprises an oil-gas separating cover without the oil-gas collecting plate and the screw adapted in the prior art. A plurality of annular oil baffles extend from the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover different length, and are integrated therewith. A drain notch is formed on the oil baffles in such a manner that the condensed liquid oil may drain into the crank case through the drain notch. A discharge hole is formed on the inner side of the oil-gas separating device and connects with a discharge pipe. The uncondensed blow-by gas flows from the discharge hole<br>
4<br><br>
and through the discharge pipe and then into the fuel supply system for re-ignition.<br>
A centrifugal disk is secured in a position corresponding to the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover with a clearance therebetween and a shape similar to that of the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover so that a twisted space is formed therebetween.<br>
During engine operation, gas and oil vapor are heated and expand to increase gas pressure. Blow-by gas is then forced to flow into the twisted space between the centrifugal disk and the oil-gas separating cover. Due to the lower gas velocity in the twisted space, the oil drops condense on the oil baffles, and then the liquid oil drains into the crank case by gravity. The uncondensed blow-by gas discharges through the discharge hole.<br>
The invention utilizes a plurality of oil baffles integrally formed with the oil-gas separating cover for the condensation of oil drops. This minimizes the number of components required but performs the same effect. Only one component is required in the present invention rather than 5 components in the prior art. Therefore, this saves costs and shortens assembly time as well as preventing the noise and vibration. Moreover, the twisted space increases<br>
5<br><br>
the surface area on which the oil drops condense so as to enhance condensation efficiency.<br>
A detailed description is given in the following embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention can be more fully understood by reading the subsequent detailed description and examples with references made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a conventional engine assembly as referenced in the Prior Art;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view of a conventional cylinder head assembly as referenced in the Prior Art;<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective exploded view of an oil-gas separating device for blow-by gas as referenced in the Prior Art;<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic view of a cylinder head assembly in the invention;<br>
Fig. 5 is a perspective view of an oil-gas separating device for blow-by gas in the invention.<br>
6<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment is shown in Figs.4, 5. The centrifugal disk 115 is secured on the left end of the cam shaft 113 by a screw 116. A plurality of annular oil baffles 1024 extends from the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover 1021 with different lengths. A drain notch 1029 is formed on the oil baffles 1024 in such manner that the condensed liquid oil drains into the crank case through the drain notch 1029 by gravity. A discharge hole 1025 is formed on the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover 1021. The uncondensed oil-gas flows through the discharge hole 1025 and a discharge pipe 1026 and discharges into a fuel supply system and flows into an engine with fuel gas for re-ignition.<br>
A centrifugal disk 115 is secured in a position corresponding to the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover 1021 with a clearance therebetween and has a shape similar to that of the inner side of the oil-gas separating cover 1021 so that a twisted space is formed therebetween. A space is formed between the oil baffle 115 and the screw 116 for oil-gas pass through. This increases surface area on which the oil-gas condenses and hence promotes the condensation efficiency.<br>
7<br><br>
During engine operation, the gas and oil vapor inside the engine are heated and expand to cause gas pressure increase. Then the blow-by gas is forced into the twisted space between the centrifugal disk 115 and the oil-gas separating cover 1021. Due to the lower gas velocity in the twisted space, the oil drops condense on the oil baffles 115, and the liquid oil drains into the crank case by gravity. The uncondensed blow-by gas flows through the discharge hole 1025 and the discharge pipe 1026 and then discharges into the fuel supply system.<br>
The oil-gas separating cover 1021 and the oil baffles 1024 can be made of industrial plastic and formed integrally by molding injection.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, only one component is required rather than 5 components in the prior art. This saves cost and shortens assembly time as well as preventing the noise and vibration. Moreover, the twisted space increases the surface area on which the oil drops condense so as to enhance the condensation efficiency.<br>
While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments.  To the contrary, it is intended to<br>
8<br><br>
cover various modifications and similar arrangements (as would be apparent to those skilled in the art). Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements.<br>
9<br><br>
