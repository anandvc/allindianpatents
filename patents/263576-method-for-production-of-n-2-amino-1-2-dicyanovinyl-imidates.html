TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The first mode of the present invention relates to a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates.    More particularly, it relates to a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates (hereinafter, referred to as RMD in some cases) represented by the following formula (1-III) under low temperature conditions within a short period of time in high yield.<br>
[0002]<br><br>
In formula (1-III), R1 is a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group; and R2 is an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group.<br>
[0003]<br>
The second mode of the present invention relates to a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidine (hereinafter, referred to as AMD-H in some cases).    More particularly, it relates to a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidine represented by the following formula (2-1!) which enhances yield of a cyclization reaction for producing \\ I 4(G) aminoimidagolc 0(1) carboxamide (hereinafter, referred to as AlCAin some cases), 4(G)-aiiruiu-1IH&gt; 5'-<w>-i"-imidoEolo 6(
[0004]<br><br><br>
The third mode of the present invention relates to a method for producing aminoimidazole derivatives.    More particularly, it relates to a method for producing aminoimldazole derivatives represented by the following formula (3-V) in high yield by using diaminomaleonitrile as a starting substance.<br>
[0006]<br><br>
In formula (3-V), each of R1 and R3  is independently a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group; and R4 is -CN or-CONH2.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0007]<br>
Methyl N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanoviny()formimidate, which is one type of the RMDs according to the first mode of the present invention, is a useful material of an intermediate for producing AICN which is a precursor of urazamide of a hepatoprotective drug, dacarbazine and temozoromide of antineoplastic drugs, or producing 4,5-dicyanoimidazole (hereinafter, referred to as DCI in some cases).<br>
[0008]<br>
As a method for synthesizing RMD, Non-Patent Document 1 describes a method for synthesizing ethyl N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formimidate (hereinafter, referred to as EMD in some cases) by reacting diaminomaleonitrile (hereinafter, referred to as DAMN in some cases) and triethyl orthoformate in dioxane at a high temperature.<br>
[0009]<br><br>
In addition, Patent Document 1 discloses a method for producing an alkyl N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyi)formimidate characierized by reacting diaminomaleonilrile and a trialkyl orthoformate in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms by means of heating and refluxing.<br>
[0010]<br>
It is known that under high temperature conditions, DAMN is decomposed or a polymerization reaction occurs.   Even in the aforementioned production methods, by-products are produced by side reactions of the aforementioned DAMN.    In addition, RMDs are easily decomposed under high temperature conditions.   For this reason, even if an RMD is produced in accordance with the aforementioned production method, a part of the RMD is decomposed.   Therefore, development of a method in which RMD can be synthesized within a short period of time under low temperature conditions is desirable.<br>
[0011]<br>
On the other hand, it is known that AICN or AICA which is an intermediate of medicine can be obtained by amidinating an RMD to form an N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidine (hereinafter, referred to as AMD in some cases), subsequently carrying out a cyclization reaction and a hydrolysis reaction in a basic aqueous solution (for example, see Patent Document 2).    Increasing the efficiencies of the aforementioned cyclization reaction and hydrolysis reaction and enhancing yield of AICN and AICA are desirable.    A method for producing an RMD which is a raw material of AMD used in the aforementioned cyclization reaction may effect efficiency of the cyclization reaction or the like.   For this reason, it is important that the method for producing the RMD complies with the cyclization reaction.<br><br><br>
[0013]<br>
N-(2-amino-'i,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidin8 of the second mode of the present invention is a useful raw material of an intermediate for producing DCI, AICN or AICA which is a precursor of urazamide of a hepatoprotective drug, or dacarbazine and temozoromide of antineoplastic drugs.<br>
[0014]<br>
Examples of synthesis methods for AMD-H Include a method in which AMD-H is obtained by a one-step reaction from diaminomaleonitrile and a method in which AMD-H is obtained by a two-step reaction from diaminomaleonitrile.<br>
As the one-step synthesis method, for example, Non-Patent Document 1 discloses a method in which DAMN and formamidine acetate are heated to refluxing temperature in ethanol.    However, the yield thereof is only 2%.<br>
[0015]<br>
Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3 disclose a method in which diaminomaleonitrile, hydrogen chloride, and isobutyronitrile or hydrogen cyanide are reacted in an organic solvent.<br>
In addition, Patent Document 4 discloses a method in which diaminomaleonitrile, formamide and phosphorous oxychloride are reacted in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
[0016]<br>
On the other hand, as the two-step synthesis method, for example, Non-Patent Document 2 discloses a method in which diaminomaleonitrile and triethyl orthoformate are reacted in dioxane at a high temperature to synthesize EMD, and EMD and ammonia are reacted in chloroform with aniline hydrochloride as a catalyst at a temperature of not more than -20°C.<br>
[0017]<br>
In addition, Patent Document 1 discloses a method in which diaminomaleonitrile and a trialkyl orthoformate are heated and refluxed in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms to synthesize an alkyl N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formimidate, and the alkyl N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formimidate is reacted with ammonia in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.<br>
[0018]<br><br>
In addition, Patent Document 5 discloses, as examples of a method of producing AMD-H by reacting an RMD represented by a compound shown by the foliowing formula (2-1) and ammonia, (1) a method in which an ammonia gas is blown into a solution or suspension of RMD in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, (2) a method in which an ammonia gas is blown into an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms to dissolve ammonia therein, followed by directly adding RMD thereto or adding a solution or suspension of RMD in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms thereto, (3) a method in which a solution or suspension of RMD in an alcohol having 1 to 5 carbon atoms is added to ammonia condensed at a low temperature, (4) a method in which an aqueous ammonia is used instead of using the ammonia gas in the aforementioned method (1) or (2), and the like.<br><br>
In formula (2-1), R11 is an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryi group.<br>
[0020]<br>
On the other hand, it is known that AICN or AICA which is an intermediate of medicine can be obtained by amidinating RMD to obtain N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidine, followed by subjecting to a cyclization reaction and a hydrolysis reaction in a basic aqueous solution (for example, see Patent Document 2).    Increasing the efficiencies of the aforementioned cyclization reaction and hydrolysis reaction and enhancing the yields of AICN and AICA are desirable.   A method for producing AMD-H used in the aforementioned cyclization reaction may effect efficiency of the cyclization reaction or the like.   For this reason, it is important that the method for producing AMD-H complies with the cyclization reaction.<br>
[0021]<br><br><br>
[0022]<br>
AICA or AICN which is one type of aminoimidazole derivatives represented by formula (3-V) according to the third mode of the present invention is a useful raw material of an intermediate for producing urazamide of a hepatoprotective drug, and dacarbazine and temozoromide of antineoplastic drugs.<br>
[0023]<br>
As a synthesis method for the aminoimidazole derivatives represented by formula {3-V), for example, a method in which 4-nitroimidazole-5-carboxamide is subjected to a catalytic reduction, a method in which phenylazomalonamidine is subjected to a reductive ring closure, a method in which a-amino-a-cyanoacetamide is used as a raw material, a method in which a compound having a purine nucleus is decomposed, and the like are known.    However, the aforementioned methods have drawbacks for industrial use in view of easy availability or easiness of operation.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0028]<br>
An objective of the first mode of the present invention is to provide a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates under low temperature conditions within a short period of time in high yield.<br>
[0029]<br>
An objective of the second mode of the present invention is to provide a method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamidine which well complies with a cyclization reaction for producing AICN, AICA and the like, and enhances the yields thereof.<br>
[0030]<br>
An objective of the third mode of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing aminoimidazole derivatives represented by formula (3-V) by cyclizing a<br>
compound represented by the following formula (3-IV) and/or a salt thereof, in high<br>
yield.	•<br><br>
In formula (S-IV), each of R1 and R3 is independently a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group.<br>
Another objective of the third mode of the present invention is to provide a method for producing aminoimidazole derivatives represented by formula (3-V) in high yield using diaminomaleonitrile as a starting substance.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems [0031]<br><br>
As a result of diligent studies in order to achieve the objective of the first mode of the present invention, the present inventors discovered that an N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanoviny)imidate can be obtained under low temperature conditions within a short period of time by reacting diaminomaleonitrile and a triester orthoformate or the like in the presence of a strong acid such as sulfuric acid.   The first modes of the present invention were completed as a result of further diligent studies on the basis of the aforementioned finding.<br>
[0032]<br>
The first modes of the present invention further include the following modes.<br>
(1)	A method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates comprising<br>
the step of reacting diaminomaleonitrile with a compound represented by the<br>
following formula (1-11):<br>
CR1   (OR2)   3	(1 - I   I)<br>
wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group; and each R2 is independently an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group, in the presence of a strong acid. [0033]<br>
(2)	The aforementioned method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates wherein the strong acid is trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or concentrated sulfuric acid.<br>
(3)	The aforementioned method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates wherein the compound represented by formula (1-11) is a triester orthoformate or a triester orthoacetate.<br>
(4)	The aforementioned method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates wherein the aforementioned reaction is carried out in an aprotic organic solvent.<br>
(5)	The aforementioned method for producing N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)imidates wherein the aforementioned aprotic organic solvent is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
[0034]<br>
As a result of further studies in order to achieve the objective of the second<br><br>
mode of the present invention, the present inventors discovered that when AMD-H obtained by reacting RMD and ammonia in an alcohol as described in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 5 is used in a cyclization reaction for producing AICN, AICA and the like, by-products are produced due to non-preferable reactions or the like, and the production of AICN, AICA and the like in high purity is inhibited.<br>
The present inventors further discovered that when AMD-H obtained by reacting RMD and ammonia in ether is used, side reactions can be controlled during the cyclization reaction.    However, an ammonia gas has poor solubility in ether represented by tetrahydrofuran, and for this reason, lines of a reactor are easily blocked, and use of an ammonia gas is disadvantageous in industrial production. Therefore, the present inventors discovered that by means of adding aqueous ammonia to a solution or suspension of RMD in ether, or alternatively adding RMD per se or a solution or suspension of RMD in ether to a liquid containing aqueous ammonia and ether to react RMD and ammonia, AMD-H which is accompanied with a cyclization reaction for producing AICN, AICA and the like and enhances the yields thereof can be produced.   The second modes of the present invention were completed as a result of further studies on the basis of the aforementioned finding.<br>
[0035]<br>
The second modes of the present invention further contain the following modes.<br>
(1)	A method for producing N-(2-amlno-1,2-dlcyanovlnyl)formamidine, comprising the steps of adding aqueous ammonia to a solution or suspension of an N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovlnyl)formlmidate In ether, or alternatively directly adding an N-(2-amino-1,2-dlcyanovinyl)formlmidate or adding a solution or suspension of an N-(2-amino-1,2-dlcyanovlnyl)formlmidate in ether to a liquid containing ether and aqueous ammonia, to react an N-(2-amlno-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formlmidate and ammonia.<br>
(2)	The aforementioned method for producing N-(2-amlno-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formamldlne, wherein the aforementioned ether is tetrahydrofuran.<br>
[0036]<br>
As a result of diligent studies in order to achieve the aforementioned objective of the third mode of the present invention, the present inventors discovered that in step (C) of cyclizing a compound represented by formula (3-IV) and/or a salt thereof in the<br><br>
presence of a basic aqueous solution, when a large amount of an aprotic organic solvent such as alcohol or the like is used, by-products are easily produced and increasing the yield is linnited.   Therefore, the present inventors discovered that in step (C) of cyclizing a compound represented by formula {3-lV) and/or a salt thereof in the presence of a basic aqueous solution, when an aprotic organic solvent is used, production of by-products is greatly reduced, and an aminoimidazole derivative represented by formula (3-V) can be obtained in high yield.<br>
In addition, the present inventors discovered that in all of step (A) of reacting diaminomaleonitrile and a compound represented by formula (3-1) in the presence of a strong acid to obtain a compound represented by formula (3-11), step (B) of reacting a compound represented by formula (3-11) and a compound represented by formula (3-III) to obtain a compound represented by formula (3-VI) and/or a salt thereof, and step (C) of cyclizing a compound represented by formula (3-VI) and/or a salt thereof in the presence of a basic aqueous solution, by means of using an aprotic organic solvent, an aminoimidazole derivative can be synthesized from diaminomaleonitrile in one pot within a short period of time in high yield.   The third mode of the present invention was completed as a result of further studies on the basis of the aforementioned finding.<br>
[0037]<br>
The third modes of the present invention further contain the following modes.<br>
(1) A method for producing aminoimidazole derivatives represented by the following formula (3-V), comprising carrying out step (C) of cyclizing a compound represented by the following formula (3-IV) and/or a salt thereof in the presence of a basic aqueous solution, in the presence of an aprotic organic solvent.<br>
[0038]<br><br>
In formula (3-IV), each of R1 and R3 is independently a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group.<br><br><br>

Among these, R1 is preferably a hydrogen atom in view of efficiency of the amidination reaction.   When R1 is a methyl group or a phenyl group, production of dicyanoimidazole derivatives preferentially occurs at the time of the cyclization reaction.<br>
[0050]<br>
Each R2 in formula (1-11) is independently an optionally substituted alkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group.    As examples of an optionally substituted alkyl group or examples of an optionally substituted aryl group in R2, mention may be made of the same examples as described in the aforementioned R1   All R2s in formula (1-11) may be the same or different.   In accordance with the production method of the first mode of the present invention, an alcohol (R2OH) derived from R2 in formula (1-11) is by-produced.   As R2, an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms is preferable, and a methyl group or an ethyl group is most preferable, since the alcohol as a by-product is easily removed efficiently.<br>
[0051]<br>
The reaction is carried out using the compound represented by formula (1-11) in an amount usually ranging from 1 to 2 equivalents, and preferably ranging from 1.05 to 1.3 equivalents with respect to DAMN.   With the usage amount within the aforementioned range, the side reaction is reduced and production cost can be<br><br>
reduced.<br>
[0052]<br>
The strong acid used in the production method of the first mode of the present invention is an acid almost completely ionized in an aqueous solution.   As examples thereof, mention may be made of sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid, methanesuifonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and the like.   A weak acid such as carbonic acid, acetic acid, boric acid, hydrogen sulfide or the like is not suitable for the production method of the first mode of the present invention.    The usage amount of the strong acid preferably ranges from 0.2 to 0.5% by mol with respect to DAMN.    If the amount of the strong acid is increased much, the amount of by-products tends to be increased.<br>
[0053]<br>
In the production method of the first mode of the present invention, a solvent can be suitably used.   The amount of the solvent usually ranges from 0 to 1 L and preferably ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 L with respect to one moi of DAMN.   As examples of the solvent, mention may be made of an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether or the like; 'an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol. isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol or the like; and other organic solvents.   Among these, an aprotic organic solvent is preferable and an ether is more preferable, and in particular, tetrahydrofuran is preferable, in view of increased efficiency of the amidination reaction, cydization reaction and hydrolysis reaction using the obtained RMD liquid.<br>
[0054]<br>
In the production method of the first mode of the present invention, the strong acid may be present in the reaction between DAMN and the compound represented by formula (1-H), and addition order of the synthesis raw materials, addition rate and the like are not particularly limited.    In the production method of the first mode of the present invention, usually, the solvent, DAMN and the compound represented by formula (1-11) in specified amounts are first placed in a reactor once or separately, and subsequently, the strong acid is added thereto.   After the strong acid is added, the reaction system is maintained at a specified temperature, and the reaction is<br><br>
carried out.<br>
The reaction temperature is not particularly limited.    If the reaction temperature is remarkably reduced, the reaction slowly proceeds, and a long period of time is needed for production.   In contrast, if the reaction temperature is remarkably increased, an amount of by-products such as 4,5-dicyanoimidazole and the like is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.   Therefore, the reaction temperature usually ranges from room temperature (around 20°C) to the reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably ranges from 30 to 50°C.   In addition, the reaction period is preferably within one hour.    If the reaction period is remarkably long, the amount of by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.'<br>
[0056]<br>
After the reaction is completed, the RMD can be isolated.   The isolation of the RMD is usually carried out by means of filtration.    In order to reduce the RMD dissolved in the solvent and improve yield, the RMD is preferably precipitated sufficiently by cooling to a temperature ranging from 0°C to room temperature.   In accordance with the aforementioned method, the RMD in high purity can be obtained. In the case in which purity must be further enhanced, purification can be carried out by means of recrystallization.<br>
[0057]<br>
An RMD is easily decomposed under high temperatures.    For this reason, the RMD liquid obtained in accordance with the production method of the first mode of the present invention is provided without isolation to the next step (such as amidization step), and is preferably utilized as it is.<br>
As examples of RMD obtained in the production method of the first mode of the present invention, mention may be made of the compounds represented by formula<br><br><br>

In the production method of the second mode of the present invention, an ether is used as the solvent.   As examples of the ether, mention may be made of tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and the like. Among these, tetrahydrofuran is preferable.<br><br>
[0062]<br>
The reaction between the RMD and ammonia is carried out bv adding aqueous ammonia to a solution or suspension of the RMD in ether, or alternatively directly adding the RMD or adding a solution or suspension of the RMD in ether to a liquid containing ether and aqueous ammonia.<br>
Aqueous ammonia is added so that the amount of ammonia preferably ranges from one equivalent to 10 equivalents, and more preferably ranges from 3 to 6 equivalents with respect to the RMD.<br>
[0063]<br>
The reaction temperature is not particularly limited.    If the reaction temperature is remarkably reduced, the reaction slov\/ly proceeds, and a long period of time is needed for production.    In contrast, if the reaction temperature is remarkably increased, the amount of the by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.   Therefore, the reaction temperature usually ranges from 0 to 50°C and preferably ranges from 10 to 30°C.    In addition, the reaction period is preferably within one hour.    If the reaction period is remarkably long, the amount of by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.<br>

In accordance with the aforementioned method, AMD-H in high purity can be obtained.    In the case in which purity must be further enhanced, purification can be carried out by means of recrystallization.<br>
In the case of providing AMD-H to a cyclization reaction or the like, the AMD-H liquid obtained in accordance with the production method of the second mode of the present invention is provided without isolation to the next step (such as cyclization step), and is preferably utilized as it is.<br>

In step (A), a strong acid may be present in the reaction betweeen DAMN and the<br><br>
compound represented by formula (3-1), and the addition order, addition rate and the like of the synthesis raw materials are not particularly limited.    In step (A), usually, a solvent is first placed in a reactor, and DAMN and the compound represented by formula (3-1) in specified amounts are together or independently added thereto, followed by adding a strong acid thereto.   After the strong acid is added, the reaction system is maintained at a specified temperature, and the reaction proceeds.<br>
[0071]<br>
The reaction temperature in step (A) is not particularly limited.    If the reaction temperature is remarkably reduced, the reaction slowly proceeds, and a long period of time is needed for production.    In contrast, if the reaction temperature is remarkably increased, a by-product such as 4,5-dicyanoimidazole or the like is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.   Therefore, the reaction temperature usually ranges from room temperature (around 20°C) to the reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably ranges from 30 to 50°C.    In addition, the reaction period is preferably within one hour.    If the reaction period is remarkably long, the amount of by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.

If the reaction temperature is remarkably reduced, the reaction slowly proceeds, and a long period of time is needed for production.    In contrast, if the reaction temperature is remarkably increased, the amount of the by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.   Therefore, the reaction temperature usually ranges from 0 to 50°C and preferably ranges from 10 to 30°C.    In addition, the reaction period is preferably within one hour.    If the reaction period is remarkably long, the amount of by-products is increased, and purity tends to be reduced.

A 35% aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, in an amount of 20.8 g (0.20 mol), was added to the obtained reaction liquid.   As a result of quantitative analysis of AlCN in the solution, AlCN was contained in an amount of 9.43 g (0.0872 mol).<br>
[0092]<br>
Comparative Example 2-1<br><br>
AMD-H was tried to be obtained in the same manner as described in Example 2-1, with the  exception of blowing an ammonia gas instead of addition of aqueous ammonia.    However, AMD-H was precipitated at a blowing inlet for ammonia gas, and the blowing inlet was closed.   Thereby, the reaction could not be continued.<br>
[0093]<br>
Comparative Example 2-2<br>
MMD, in an amount of 3.00 g (20 mmol), and 10 mL of methanol were placed In a four-necked flask with a volume of 100 mL.   Thereby, a slurry of MMD was obtained.<br>
A methanol solution in which 1.77 g (100 mmol) of ammonia was dissolved In 10 mL of methanol was added to the aforementioned slurry of MMD.   The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature.   Thereby, a slurry of AMD-H was obtained. As a result of HPLC analysis of the aforementioned slurry of AMD-H, purity of AMD-H in view of area ratio was 92%.<br>
A 25% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, in an amount of 3.20 g (20 mmol) was added to the slurry of AMD-H.   The mixture was stirred for 20 hours at room temperature.   Thereby, a reaction liquid of AICN was obtained.   As a result of HPLC analysis of the reaction liquid, in view of area ratio, 46% of AICN, 14% of DC, and 35% of AlC-imidate represented by the following formula (2-V) were obtained.<br><br>
From the aforementioned results, it can be seen that when AMD-H obtained by the reaction with aqueous ammonia in ether is used in accordance with the second mode and the third mode of the present invention, yield of the cyclization reaction is enhanced, and AICN with high purity can be obtained.   In contrast, it can be seen that when AMD-H obtained by the reaction with ammonia in an alcohol, side reactions during the cyclization reaction are increased, and yield of AICN is poor.<br><br>
[0096]<br>
Example 3-1<br>
A slurry of MMD was obtained in the same manner as described in Example 2-1. (R)-2-amino-1-methylethanol, in an amount of 4,89 g (0.066 mol), was added to the aforementioned slurry of MMD (MMD = 9.0 g (0.06 mol), THF = 60 mL) at 5°C.   The mixture was stirred for 4 hours at 5 to 10°C.   Thereby, a liquid of a compound represented by the following formula (3-IVa) was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, 14.4 g (90 mmol) of a 25% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added dropwise thereto over 10 minutes at 10°C.   After completion of the addition, the mixture was stirred for 18 hours at 10°C.   A 35% aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, in an amount of 11.8 g (0.11 mol), was added to the obtained reaction liquid, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes.   As a result of HPLC analysis of the reaction liquid, AICN-(R)HP represented by the following formula (3-Va) was contained in 82% in view of area ratio.<br><br>
Example 3-2<br>
A compound represented by the following formula (3-IVb) and AICN-(S)HP represented by the following formula (3-Vb) were obtained in the same manner as described in Example 3-1 with the exception of replacing (R)-2-amino-1-methylethanol with (S)-2-amino-1-methylethanol.   As a result of an HPLC analysis, AICN-(S)HP represented by the following formula (3-Vb) was contained in 90.2% in view of area ratio.<br><br>
