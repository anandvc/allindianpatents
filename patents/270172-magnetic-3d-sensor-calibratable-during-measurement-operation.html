OPERATION<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to Hall sensors for detecting<br>
spatial components of a magnetic field at a reference<br>
point, as well as to calibration and measurement methods<br>
used therein.<br>
Apart from measuring magnetic fields with regard to amount<br>
and direction, Hall sensor elements based on the Hall-<br>
Effect are frequently used in the art, for contactless<br>
touchless signal generators for wearless detection of the<br>
position of switches or actuators. A further possible field<br>
of application is current measurement, wherein a Hall<br>
sensor element is positioned close to a conductive trace<br>
and measures the current in the conductive trace in a<br>
contactless manner by detecting the magnetic field<br>
generated by the current in the conductive trace. In<br>
practical application, Hall sensor elements have<br>
particularly shown to be useful due to their relatively<br>
strong insensitivity against outside influences, such as<br>
contamination, etc.<br>
In the art, both the so-called horizontal or lateral Hall<br>
sensor elements and vertical sensor elements are known,<br>
wherein Fig. 9a exemplarily shows a horizontal Hall sensor<br>
element and Fig. 9b a vertical Hall sensor element<br>
according to the prior art.<br>
Generally, a Hall sensor element consists of a<br>
semiconductor die having four contact terminals provided<br>
for electrical connection to an external control circuit.<br>
Of the four contact terminals of a Hall sensor element, two<br>
contact terminals are provided for operating current<br>
impression by an active semiconductor region, while the<br>
other two contact terminals are provided for detecting the<br><br>
Hall voltage. If the operating current-carrying<br>
semiconductor die is exposed to a magnetic field having the<br>
induction/?, a deviation of the current paths results,<br>
which is caused by the "Lorentz force" acting on the moving<br>
charge carriers in the magnetic field. The Hall voltage<br>
results perpendicular to the direction of the current flow<br>
and perpendicular to the applied magnetic field in the<br>
active semiconductor region.<br>
As basically shown in Fig. 9a, a horizontal Hall sensor<br>
element 900 according to the prior art generally consists<br>
of an n-doped semiconductor region 902 on a p-doped<br>
semiconductor substrate 904. A Hall sensor element arranged<br>
in parallel to a chip surface (x-y-Level) is referred to as<br>
horizontal.<br>
The n-doped active region 902 is normally connected to an<br>
external control or evaluation logic, respectively, via<br>
four contact electrodes 906a-d arranged in the active<br>
region 902 in opposing pairs. For reasons of clarity, the<br>
control or evaluation logic, respectively, is not<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9. The four contact electrodes 906a-d<br>
are subdivided into two opposing control current contact<br>
electrodes 906a and 906c, which are provided for generating<br>
a current flow IH through the active region 902, and<br>
further into two opposing voltage tapping contact<br>
electrodes 906b and 906d, which are provided for tapping a<br>
Hall voltage UH, which occurs with an applied magnetic<br>
field B perpendicular to the current flow in the active<br>
region 910 and the applied magnetic field, as a sensor<br>
signal. By impressing the current flow IH between different<br>
contact electrodes and correspondingly tapping the Hall<br>
voltage UH at the other contact electrodes perpendicular to<br>
the current flow, compensation methods can be implemented,<br>
which allow the compensation of tolerances occurring in the<br>
Hall sensors, for example, due to production tolerances,<br>
etc, across several measurement cycles.<br><br>
As can be seen from the horizontal Hall sensor element 900<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9a, the active region is defined<br>
between the contact terminals 906a-d, such that the active<br>
region has an effective length L and an effective width W.<br>
The horizontal Hall sensor 900 illustrated in Fig. 9a can<br>
be produced relatively easily with conventional CMOS-<br>
processes (CMOS = Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor)<br>
for producing semiconductor structures.<br>
Further, apart from the horizontal Hall sensor elements,<br>
implementations of the so-called vertical Hall sensor<br>
arrangements are known in the prior art, which also allow<br>
the usage of the standard semiconductor production<br>
technologies, for example, CMOS-processes. One example of a<br>
vertical Hall sensor element 920 is basically illustrated<br>
in Fig. 9b, wherein vertical means a level perpendicular to<br>
the level of the chip surface (X-Y-level). In the vertical<br>
Hall sensor element 920 illustrated in Fig. 9b, the<br>
preferably n-doped active semiconductor region 922 extends<br>
in the form of a well in a p-doped semiconductor substrate<br>
924, wherein the active semiconductor region 922 has a<br>
depth T. As illustrated in Fig. 9b, the vertical Hall<br>
sensor element has three contact regions 926a-c, which are<br>
bordering on the main surface of the semiconductor<br>
substrate 924, wherein the contact terminals 926a-c are all<br>
within the active semiconductor region 922. Due to the<br>
three contact regions, this variation of vertical Hall<br>
sensor elements is also called 3-pin sensor.<br>
Thus, the vertical Hall sensor element 920 illustrated in<br>
Fig. 9b has three contact regions 926a-c along the main<br>
surface of the active semiconductor region 922, wherein the<br>
contact region 926a is connected to contact terminal A, the<br>
contact region 926b is connected to contact terminal B, and<br>
wherein the contact region 926c is connected to a contact<br>
terminal C. If a voltage is applied between the two contact<br>
terminals A and C, a current flow IH through the active<br>
semiconductor region 922 results, and a Hall voltage UH,<br><br>
which is perpendicular to the current flow IH and the<br>
magnetic field B, can be measured at the contact terminal<br>
B. The effective regions of the active semiconductor<br>
regions 922 are predetermined by the depth T of the active<br>
semiconductor region 922 and the length L according to the<br>
distance between the current feeding contact electrodes<br>
926a and 926c.<br>
Horizontal and vertical Hall sensors, as well as the<br>
methods for reducing offsets resulting from device<br>
tolerances, such as contaminations, asymmetries,<br>
piezoelectric effects, aging effects, etc, for example the<br>
spinning current method, are already known in literature,<br>
e.g. R. S. Popovic, „Hall Effect Devices, Magnetic Sensors<br>
and Characterization of Semiconductors", Adam Hilger, 1991,<br>
ISBN 0-7503-0096-5. Vertical sensors operated by spinning-<br>
current frequently consist of two or four individual<br>
sensors, as it is for example described in DE 101 50 955<br>
and DE 101 50 950.<br>
Further, apart from the variation of the 3-pin vertical<br>
Hall sensor elements, there are so-called 5-pin vertical<br>
Hall sensor elements, which are also described in DE 101 50<br>
955 and De 101 50 950. In the 5-pin Hall sensor elements<br>
there is also the possibility of performing a measurement<br>
compensated by tolerances of the individual devices with a<br>
compensation method extending across several measurement<br>
phases, for example, a spinning current method could be<br>
used here as well.<br>
The spinning current technique consists of continuously<br>
cyclically rotating the measurement direction for detecting<br>
the Hall voltage at the Hall sensor element with a certain<br>
clock frequency, for example by 90°, and to sum it across<br>
all measurement signals of a full rotation by 360°. Thus,<br>
in a Hall sensor element having four contact regions, two<br>
of which are arranged in pairs, each of the contact pairs<br>
is used both as control current contact regions for current<br><br>
feeding and as measurement contact regions for tapping the<br>
Hall signal depending on the spinning current phase. Thus,<br>
in a spinning current phase or in a spinning current cycle,<br>
respectively, the operating current (control current IH)<br>
flows between two associated contact regions, wherein the<br>
Hall voltage is tapped at the two other contact regions<br>
associated to each other.<br>
In the next cycle, the measurement direction is rotated<br>
further by 90°, so that the contact regions used for<br>
tapping the Hall voltage in the previous cycle are now used<br>
for feeding the control current. By summation across all<br>
four cycles or phases, respectively, offset voltages caused<br>
by production or material approximately cancel each other<br>
out, such that only the actually magnetic field dependent<br>
portions of the signals remain. This process can also be<br>
applied to a larger number of contact pairs, wherein, for<br>
example, with four contact pairs (having eight contact<br>
regions) the spinning current phases are cyclically rotated<br>
by 45°, in order to sum up all measurement signals across a<br>
full rotation by 360°.<br>
In horizontal Hall sensors, four sensors are also<br>
frequently used, wherein, with an appropriate arrangement,<br>
the offset can additionally be heavily reduced by spatial<br>
spinning current operation, see e.g. DE 199 43 128.<br>
If a magnetic field is to be measured for several spatial<br>
directions, mostly separate Hall sensor elements are used.<br>
The usage of separate sensors, for example for detecting<br>
the three spatial directions of a magnetic field, generally<br>
causes the problem that the magnetic field to be measured<br>
is not measured at one point, but at three different<br>
points. Fig. 10 illustrates this aspect, wherein Fig. 10<br>
shows three Hall sensors 1002, 1004, and 1006. The first<br>
Hall sensor 1002 is provided for detecting a y-spatial<br>
component, the second Hall sensor 1004 for detecting a z-<br>
spatial component, and the third Hall sensor 1006 for<br><br>
detecting an x-spatial component. The individual sensors<br>
1002, 1004, and 1006 measure the corresponding spatial<br>
components of a magnetic field approximately at the<br>
respective centers of the individual sensors.<br>
An individual sensor can again consist of several Hall<br>
sensor elements. Fig. 10 shows exemplarily three individual<br>
sensors having four Hall sensor elements each, wherein in<br>
Fig. 10 exemplarily a horizontal Hall sensor 1004 is<br>
assumed, which detects a z-component of the magnetic field<br>
to be measured, and a vertical Hall sensor 1002 and 1006<br>
each for the y- or x-component of the magnetic field to be<br>
measured. The arrangement for detecting the spatial<br>
magnetic field components, exemplarily illustrated in Fig.<br>
10, has the problem that the magnetic field cannot be<br>
measured at one point, but at the respective centers of the<br>
individual sensors. This inevitably causes a corruption,<br>
since no exact evaluation of the magnetic field is possible<br>
based on the magnetic field components of the magnetic<br>
field sensors detected at different positions.<br>
A further aspect of the detection and evaluation of the<br>
magnetic fields by Hall sensor elements is the calibration<br>
of the individual elements. According to the prior art,<br>
Hall sensor elements are mostly provided with so-called<br>
excitation lines, which allow the generation of a defined<br>
magnetic field at the measurement point of an individual<br>
sensor, for subsequently obtaining calibration of the<br>
sensor by comparing or associating the measured Hall<br>
voltage to the defined magnetic field.<br>
Excitation conductors allow the generation of an artificial<br>
magnetic field at a Hall sensor, which allows a simple<br>
wafer test, i.e. a test directly on the substrate as well<br>
as a self-test and a sensitivity calibration during<br>
operation, see Janez Trontelj, 'Optimization of Integrated<br>
Magnetic Sensor by Mixed Signal Processing, Proceedings of<br>
the 16th IEEE Vol. 1. This is particularly interesting in<br><br>
detecting an x-spatial component. The individual sensors<br>
1002, 1004, and 1006 measure the corresponding spatial<br>
components of a magnetic field approximately at the<br>
respective centers of the individual sensors.<br>
An individual sensor can again consist of several Hall<br>
sensor elements. Fig. 10 shows exemplarily three individual<br>
sensors having four Hall sensor elements each, wherein in<br>
Fig. 10 exemplarily a horizontal Hall sensor 1004 is<br>
assumed, which detects a z-component of the magnetic field<br>
to be measured, and a vertical Hall sensor 1002 and 1006<br>
each for the y- or x-component of the magnetic field to be<br>
measured. The arrangement for detecting the spatial<br>
magnetic field components, exemplarily illustrated in Fig.<br>
10, has the problem that the magnetic field cannot be<br>
measured at one point, but at the respective centers of the<br>
individual sensors. This inevitably causes a corruption,<br>
since no exact evaluation of the magnetic field is possible<br>
based on the magnetic field components of the magnetic<br>
field sensors detected at different positions.<br>
A further aspect of the detection and evaluation of the<br>
magnetic fields by Hall sensor elements is the calibration<br>
of the individual elements. According to the prior art,<br>
Hall sensor elements are mostly provided with so-called<br>
excitation lines, which allow the generation of a defined<br>
magnetic field at the measurement point of an individual<br>
sensor, for subsequently obtaining calibration of the<br>
sensor by comparing or associating the measured Hall<br>

as a self-test and a sensitivity calibration during<br>
operation, see Janez Trontelj, "Optimization of Integrated<br>
Magnetic Sensor by Mixed Signal Processing, Proceedings of<br>
the 16th IEEE Vol. 1. This is particularly interesting in<br><br>
security critical areas, e.g. in the automobile industry or<br>
also in medical technology, since self-monitoring of the<br>
sensors is possible during operation.<br>
If, for example, several individual sensors are used for<br>
detecting the spatial components of a magnetic field, as<br>
exemplarily shown in Fig. 10, every individual sensor<br>
requires a respective excitation line for calibration, and<br>
the individual sensors are further calibrated individually.<br>
It follows that the calibration effort scales with the<br>
number of individual sensor elements, and, in the case of<br>
spatially detecting three magnetic field components, the<br>
same is increased three times compared to the calibration<br>
effort of an individual sensor.<br>
One approach for allowing an evaluation of a magnetic<br>
field, i.e. a measurement at one point, is a 3D sensor of<br>
the Ecole Polytechnique Federal Lausanne EPFL, cf. C.<br>
Schott, R. S. Popovic, „Integrated 3D Hall Magnetic Field<br>
Sensor", Transducers '99, June 7-10, Sensai, Japan, VOL. 1,<br>
PP. 168-171, 1999. Fig. 11 schematically shows such a Hall<br>
sensor 1100, which is implemented on a semiconductor<br>
substrate 1102. First, the 3D sensor has four contact areas<br>
1104a-d, across which currents can be impressed in the<br>
semiconductor substrate 1102. Further, the 3D sensor has<br>
four measurement contact areas 106a-d, via which the<br>
different magnetic components can be detected. A wiring<br>
1110 is illustrated on the right-hand side of Fig. 11. The<br>
shown wiring composed of four operational amplifiers 1112a-<br>
d evaluates the Hall voltages proportional to the<br>
individual magnetic field components and outputs the<br>
respective components at the terminals 1114a-c in the form<br>
of signals Vx, Vy, and Vz.<br>
The illustrated sensor has the problem that the same can<br>
only be calibrated by a defined externally generated<br>
magnetic field and has no individual excitation line.<br>
Further, due to its structure and its mode of operation,<br><br>
this sensor cannot be operated with the compensation<br>
method, e.g. spinning current method. Further, another<br>
problem of the structure shown in Fig. 11 is that such a<br>
semiconductor device has offset voltages due to<br>
contamination of the semiconductor material, asymmetries in<br>
contacting, variances in the crystal structure, etc., which<br>
cannot be suppressed by a respective spinning-current<br>
suitable compensation wiring. Thus, the sensor does measure<br>
magnetic field components at the focused point, but has a<br>
high offset and is thus only suitable for precise<br>
measurements in a limited manner. Fig. 12 shows a 3D sensor<br>
suitable for compensation (spinning-current), which detects<br>
spatial magnetic field components at a measurement point,<br>
and which is discussed by Enrico Schurig in ,,Highly<br>
Sensitive Vertical Hall Sensors in CMOS Technology",<br>

WW 185 ff. The top part of Fig. 12 shows the 3D sensor of<br>
Fig. 10 consisting of three individual sensors. The upper<br>
part of Fig. 12 shows the three separate individual sensors<br>
1002, 1004, and 1006 for detecting the spatial magnetic<br>
field components. The bottom part of Fig. 12 shows an<br>
alternative arrangement of the individual sensors.<br><br>
In this arrangement, the sensor 1004 remains unaltered,<br>
since the measurement point of the sensor 1004 is in the<br>
center of the arrangement 1200 in Fig. 12, further, the two<br>
individual sensors 1002 and 1006 consist of individual<br>
elements that can be separated. The sensor 1002 is now<br>
subdivided into two sensor parts 1202a and 1202b and<br>
arranged symmetrically around the center of the sensor<br>
element 1004. An analog method is performed with the sensor<br>
1006, such that the same is also divided into two sensor<br>
parts 1206a and 1206b that are arranged symmetrically<br>
around the center of the sensor elements 1004, along the<br>
respective spatial axis. Due to the symmetrical arrangement<br>
of the individual sensor elements, the magnetic field is<br>
detected at one point, which lies in the geometrical center<br>
of the arrangement. One disadvantage of this arrangement is<br>
that the sensor can only be calibrated across several<br>
excitation lines. In the following, the arrangement 1200 in<br>
the bottom part of Fig. 12 will be referred to as pixel<br>
cell without calibration.<br>
Dragana R. Popvic et al. describes in "Three-Axis<br>
Teslameter with Integrated Hall Probe Free from the Planar<br>
Hall Effect" a three-dimensional Hall Sensor integrated in<br>
a semiconductor chip. Further, a wiring of the magnetic<br>
field sensor is described, which allows to compensate<br>
measurement tolerances caused, for example, by temperature<br>
drift.<br>
EP 1 637 898 Al discloses a one-dimensional magnetic field<br>
sensor calibratable via a reference field. Thereby, a<br>
reference field generator generates a magnetic alternating<br>
field differing significantly in frequency from a<br>
measurement field. A downstream signal processing allows a<br>
calibration of the sensor or a compensation of temperature<br>
effects, respectively, by separating the measurement or<br>
reference field components, respectively, in the frequency<br>
domain. A horizontal magnetic field sensor, a so-called<br>
Hall die, is used as magnetic field sensor.<br><br>
This object is solved by a magnetic field sensor<br>
calibratable during measurement operation according to<br>
claim 1 and a method for calibrating a magnetic field<br>
sensor during a measurement operation according to claim<br>
11.<br>
The present invention provides a magnetic field sensor<br>
calibratable during a measurement operation for detecting<br>
first, second, and third spatial components Bz, By, and Bx<br>
of a magnetic field at a reference point, wherein the<br>
magnetic field has first, second, and third measurement<br>
field components BM2, BMy, BMx and first, second and third<br>
calibration field components BKz, BKy, and BKx, comprising a<br>
first sensor element arrangement for detecting the first<br>
magnetic field component Bz having a first measurement<br>
field component BMz and a first calibration field component<br>
BKz with respect to a first spatial axis z at the reference<br>
point. Further, the magnetic field sensor comprises a<br>
second sensor element arrangement for detecting the second<br>
magnetic field component By having a second measurement<br>
field component BMy and a second calibration field<br>
component BKy, with respect to a second spatial axis y at<br><br>
reference point, and a third sensor element arrangement for<br>
detecting the third magnetic field component Bx, having a<br>
third measurement field component BMx and a third<br>
calibration field component BKx, with respect to a third<br>
spatial axis x at the reference point. Further, the<br>
magnetic field sensor has an excitation line, which is<br>
arranged such with respect to the first, second and third<br>
sensor element arrangements, that when impressing a<br>
predetermined current into the excitation line, a first<br>
predetermined calibration field component BKz with respect<br>
to the first spatial axis z in the first sensor element<br>
arrangement is generated, a second predetermined<br>
calibration field component BKy with respect to the second<br>
spatial axis y in the second sensor element arrangement is<br>
generated, and a third predetermined calibration field<br>
component BKx with respect to the third spatial axis x in<br>
the third sensor element arrangement is generated, wherein<br>
the three spatial axes z, y, x run along linearly<br>
independent position vectors.<br>
The object is further solved by a method for calibrating a<br>
magnetic field sensor during measurement operation by<br>
detecting first, second, and third spatial components Bz,<br>
By, and Bx of a magnetic field at a reference point,<br>
wherein the magnetic field has first, second, and third<br>
measurement field components BMz, BMy, and BMx and a first,<br>
second, and a third calibration field component BKz, BKy,<br>
and BKx, comprising a step of detecting the first magnetic<br>
field component Bx having a first measurement field<br>
component BMz and a first calibration field component BKz,<br>
with respect to the first spatial axis z at the reference<br>
point, and of detecting the second magnetic field component<br>
By, having a second measurement field component BMy and a<br>
second calibration field component BKy, with respect to the<br>
second spatial axis y at the reference point. The method<br>
further comprises a step of detecting the third magnetic<br>
field component Bx, having a third measurement field<br>
component BMx and a third calibration field component BKx,<br><br>
with respect to the third spatial axis x at the referent<br>
point, and a step of generating the first, second, and<br>
third calibration field components Bkz, BKy, and BKx with<br>
respect to the first, second and third spatial axes z, y,<br>
and x, wherein the first, second and third spatial axes<br>
runs along linearly independent position vectors.<br>
The present invention is based on the knowledge that a<br>
spatial arrangement of different magnetic field sensors,<br>
preferably symmetrically in pairs, which detect the<br>
components of a magnetic field at one point, and which can<br>
be operated with a compensation method, such as the<br>
spinning-current-method, offers the possibility to<br>
calibrate the same during operation by applying a<br>
calibration field caused by a single excitation line. The<br>
inventive magnetic field sensor can be simultaneously in a<br>
measurement field and a calibration field, and can be<br>
operated in a measurement method consisting of several<br>
measurement phases, preferably spinning-current.<br>
A first combination of the measurement results of the<br>
individual phases allows the extraction of a measurement<br>
component originating from the magnetic field to be<br>
measured, and in which both components originating from the<br>
calibration field and components originating from device<br>
tolerances are substantially eliminated. Further, a second<br>
combination of the measurement results of the individual<br>
measurement phases allows the extraction of a measurement<br>
component originating from the calibration field and in<br>
which components of the magnetic field to be measured are<br>
substantially eliminated.<br>
The inventive magnetic field sensor and the inventive<br>
method have the advantage that no additional measurement<br>
phases are required for calibration when using conventional<br>
compensation methods, such as the spinning current method.<br><br>
An excitation line, which generates calibration field<br>
components in all spatial directions due to its geometry is<br>
powered, i.e. the calibration field is directed such that<br>
the two combinations of the measurement results from the<br>
individual measurement phases are enabled in the described<br>
way. Thus, generation and direction of the calibration<br>
field is adapted to the measurement phases of the<br>
compensation method or integrated in the same,<br>
respectively. This has the advantage that the arrangement<br>
needs only a single excitation line, which results in the<br>
inventive magnetic field sensor providing simple and<br>
uncomplicated test options. The excitation lines of several<br>
inventive magnetic field sensors can, for example, be<br>
cascaded and thus be tested together in an on-wafer-test.<br>
It is a further advantage of the inventive magnetic field<br>
sensor and method that the magnetic field sensor can be<br>
calibrated during operation and that no additional hardware<br>
or time effort is required. For example, the measurement<br>
results of the individual measurement phases can be<br>
combined or evaluated, respectively, by a micro-controller<br>
or a processor, so that the additional effort is limited to<br>
one additional computation operation. The measurement field<br>
components and the calibration field components can each be<br>
provided simultaneously and in a compensated manner. This<br>
is particularly advantageous in security critical<br>
applications, for example, such as in the automobile<br>
industry or medical technology, since the magnetic field<br>
sensor can be continuously calibrated or adjusted,<br>
respectively, and its functionality can simultaneously be<br>
monitored without having to make compromises with regard to<br>
the quality or quantity of a measurement.<br>

With regard to the following discussion, it should be<br>

different embodiments have the same reference numbers and<br>
are thus interchangeable in the different embodiments<br>
illustrated below.<br>
The inventive structure of a magnetic field sensor 100<br>
calibratable during operation according to a first<br>
embodiment will be discussed with reference to Fig. 1. Fig.<br>
1 shows an embodiment of an inventive magnetic field sensor<br>
100 for detecting a magnetic field at a reference point<br>
101. Further, Fig. 1 shows a first sensor element<br>
arrangement 102, a second sensor element arrangement 104,<br>
and a third sensor element arrangement 106. Further, an<br>
excitation line 108 is illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
The magnetic field sensor can, for example, be implemented<br>
on a substrate whose main surface runs parallel to the x-y-<br>
level of the arrangement, wherein the z-component runs<br>
perpendicular thereto. Correspondingly, the magnetic field<br>
is divided into three components Bz, By and Bx, each<br>
composed of a measurement field component BMz, BMy and BMk,<br>
and a calibration field component BKz, BKy and BKx.<br><br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, for detecting the first, second,<br>
and third spatial components Bz, By and Bx of a magnetic<br>
field with the flow density B at a reference point 101,<br>
the magnetic field sensor 100 comprises the first sensor<br>
element arrangement 102 for detecting the first magnetic<br>
field component Bz having the first measurement field<br>
component BMz and a first calibration field component BKz<br>
with respect to a first spatial axis z at the reference<br>
point 101. In one embodiment, the sensor element<br>
arrangement 102 is preferably realized by a horizontal Hall<br>
sensor element whose measurement point is at the reference<br>
point 101.<br>
Further, the magnetic field sensor 100 comprises the second<br>
sensor element arrangement 104 for detecting the second<br>
magnetic field component By having the second measurement<br>
field component BMy and the second calibration field<br>
component BKy with respect to the second spatial axis y at<br>
the reference point 101. In one embodiment, the sensor<br>
element arrangement 104 is preferably realized by an<br>
arrangement of several vertical Hall sensor elements that<br>
are arranged in pairs symmetrical to the reference point<br>
101. Further, the magnetic field sensor 100 comprises the<br>
third sensor element arrangement 106 for detecting the<br>
third magnetic field component Bx having the third<br>
measurement field component BMx and the third calibration<br>
field component BKx with respect to the third spatial axis<br>
x at the reference point 101. In one embodiment, the sensor<br>
element arrangement 106 is preferably realized by an<br>
arrangement of several vertical Hall sensor elements that<br>
are arranged in pairs symmetrical to the reference point<br>
101.<br>
The excitation line 108 of the magnetic field sensor 100 is<br>
preferably arranged with respect to the first 102, second<br>
104, and third 106 sensor arrangements such that when<br>
impressing a predetermined current into the excitation line<br>
108, the first predetermined calibration field component<br><br>
BKz with respect to the first spatial axis z in the first<br>
sensor element arrangement 102 is generated, the second<br>
predetermined calibration field component BKy with respect<br>
to the second spatial axis y in the second sensor element<br>
arrangement 104 is generated, and the third predetermined<br>
calibration field component BKx with respect to the third<br>
spatial axis x in the third sensor element arrangement 106<br>
is generated, wherein the three spatial axes z, y, and x<br>
run along linearly independent position vectors.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 1, the position vectors of the<br>
three spatial axes z, y, and x run orthogonally, and the<br>
three sensor element arrangements detect the magnetic field<br>
according to its orthogonal components Bz=BMz + BKz, By=BMy+BKy<br>
und Bx=BMx+BKx. For simplicity reasons, it is assumed here<br>
and in the following description that the magnetic field is<br>
detected by orthogonally arranged sensor element<br>
arrangements according to its components Bz, By, and Bx. In<br>
other embodiments of the present invention, the sensor<br>
elements can be basically arranged in any direction, as<br>
long as they can fully detect the spatial components of the<br>
measurement field.<br>
For illustrating the generation of the calibration field<br>
components BKz, BKy, and BKx, Fig. 2 shows a cross-section of<br>
the magnetic field sensor 100. In the cross-section<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2, the first sensor element arrangement<br>
102 can be seen in the center, as well as a cross-section<br>
through the second sensor element arrangement 106, the<br>
cross-sections of which can each be seen to the left and<br>
right of the first sensor element arrangement 102. Above<br>
the second sensor element arrangement 106, with respect to<br>
the main surface (x-y-level) of the substrate, runs the<br>
excitation line 108. The geometry of the excitation line<br>
108, i.e. its length and dimensions, are selected such that<br>
due to a known impressed current, a predetermined magnetic<br>
calibration flow density BKz, BKy, and BKx is present that<br>
can be attributed to the excitation line 108. The<br><br>
calibration flow density can be adjusted in a defined<br>
manner by the current IE and the geometry or the<br>
properties, respectively, of the excitation line 108, i.e.<br>
its height, width, thickness, material, relative position,<br>
etc., and the sensor element arrangement can be calibrated<br>
by determining and associating the associated Hall voltage.<br>
With the known magnetic calibration flow densities, the<br>
Hall voltages generated thereby can be associated and thus<br>
the magnetic field sensor can become calibratable.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, it is assumed that a current<br>
It flows through the excitation line, wherein in the cross-<br>
section illustrated in Fig. 2, the current is to flow into<br>
the arrangement through the right excitation line 108, and<br>
is to flow out again on the left side through the<br>
excitation line 108. The current flowing through the<br>
excitation line 108 generates a magnetic field, whose field<br>
lines are indicated by concentric circles 200 around the<br>
excitation line 108 in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the<br>
sensor element arrangement 102 is interspersed by all<br>
magnetic field lines 200 in the same direction. Further, it<br>
can be seen that the cross-sections of the sensor element<br>
arrangement illustrated in Fig. 2 are interspersed in the<br>
opposite sense by the magnetic field lines 200.<br>
Analogously, this applies for the third sensor element<br>
arrangement 104, which is not shown in Fig. 2 for clarity<br>
reasons, whose constellation is equivalent to the sensor<br>
element arrangement 106. The pattern of the field lines<br>
200, as well as the orientation of the field lines 200 by<br>
which they intersperse the individual sensor element<br>
arrangements, illustrates that a calibration of the sensor<br>
element arrangement 102 is possible with the magnetic field<br>
generated by the excitation line 108, while the calibration<br>
of the second and third sensor element arrangements 104 and<br>
106 requires compensation of the oppositely acting field<br>
lines.<br><br>
It can be seen from Fig. 2 that calibration of the magnetic<br>
field sensor and detection of the measurement field can<br>
take place in different operating phases, during which the<br>
excitation current can assume different polarities<br>
(directions) and the sensor element arrangements<br>
alternately provide Hall voltages. The first 102, second<br>
104, and third sensor element arrangements 106 can be<br>
operated in different operating phases, wherein in every<br>
operating phase each of the first 102, second 104, and<br>
third sensor element arrangements 106 provides a<br>
measurement signal attributed to the operating phase,<br>
wherein the measurement signals attributed to the operating<br>
phases can be combined to a first total measurement value<br>
by a first linear combination, such that the influence of<br>
the measurement field components is reduced in the first<br>
total measurement value, or the measurement signals<br>
attributed to the operating phase can be combined to a<br>
second total measurement value by a second linear<br>
combination, such that the influence of the calibration<br>
field component is reduced in the second total measurement<br>
value. The influence of the measurement field component or<br>
the calibration field component, respectively, in the first<br>
or second total measurement value, respectively, can be<br>
less than 10%, 1%, or 0.1% of the first or second total<br>
measurement value. The operating phases and the detection<br>
of the different calibration field or measurement field<br>
components, respectively, will be discussed below with<br>
reference to a further preferred embodiment and with<br>
reference to Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
For this reason, a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention is illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 shows a<br>
preferred embodiment of the inventive magnetic field sensor<br>
100. Analogously, the magnetic field sensor 100 comprises a<br>
first sensor element arrangement 102 around a reference<br>
point 101, a second sensor element arrangement 104, and a<br>
third sensor element arrangement 106. Further, the magnetic<br>
field sensor 100 comprises an excitation line 108. In the<br><br>
arrangement shown in Fig. 3, the sensor element<br>
arrangements 104 and 106 each have four individual sensor<br>
elements that are each arranged in pairs 104ab and 104cd,<br>
or 106ab and 106cd, respectively, symmetrical with respect<br>
to the reference point 101.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3, the sensor element<br>
arrangements 104 and 106 can be realized, for example, by<br>
an arrangement of vertical Hall sensor elements. The second<br>
sensor element arrangement 104 in the embodiment in Fig. 3<br>
is composed of four individual sensor elements 104a-d. In<br>
the same manner, the third sensor element arrangement 106<br>
is composed of four preferably equal sensor elements 106a-<br>
d. The usage of individual sensor elements, such as 104a-d<br>
and 106a-d allows wiring the individual elements in a<br>
compensation wiring.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates an inventive wiring of the vertical<br>
individual elements and discusses the principle of a<br>
compensation concept. Fig. 4aI shows the wiring of four<br>
vertical Hall sensor elements, for example, in the second<br>
sensor element arrangement 104 with elements 104a-d. In the<br>
arrangement shown in Fig. 4aI, vertical 3-pin hole sensor<br>
elements are used, which are preferably wired on one axis<br>
according to Fig. 3. Fig. 4aI shows two vertical Hall<br>
sensors element pairs 104ab and 104cd, wherein the two<br>
sensor elements 104a and 104b form the sensor element pair<br>
104ab, and the two sensor elements 104c and 104d form the<br>
sensor element pair 104cd. In the considered embodiment,<br>
one vertical Hall sensor element pair each forms a sensor<br>
for detecting a magnetic field component that is arranged<br>
symmetrically around the reference point 101 according to<br>
Fig. 3. The sensor element pair 104ab and 104cd detects,<br>
for example, the By component of the magnetic field.<br>
The two vertical Hall sensor element pairs 104ab and 104cd<br>
are identically structured such that that the structure can<br>
be discussed below based on the vertical Hall sensor<br><br>
element pair 104ab. The same applies for the Hall sensor<br>
element pairs 106ab and 106cd that then detect, for<br>
example, the Bx component of the magnetic field. The<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab consists of two<br>
vertical Hall sensor elements 104a and 104b. Preferably,<br>
every vertical Hall sensor element has three contact areas,<br>
wherein in the arrangement of the embodiment considered<br>
here, the external contacts 115 and 116, as well as the<br>
internal contacts 117 and 118 are electrically coupled to<br>
each other, and the contacts 19 and 120 are implemented for<br>
detecting the Hall voltage. Overall, as shown in Fig. 4aI,<br>
four contact terminals T0-T3 result, by which the two<br>
sensor element arrangements 104ab and 104cd are connected<br>
in parallel. If a current IH is impressed between the<br>
contact terminals TO and T2, a Hall voltage UH can be<br>
measured between the contact terminals T1 and T3 when a<br>
magnetic field with the respective components is present,<br>
as illustrated in Fig. 4aI.<br>
The structure of the second vertical Hall sensor element<br>
pair 104cd is identical. Only the contact terminals T0-T3<br>
are shifted by one position with respect to the vertical<br>
Hall sensor element pair 104ab, i.e. contacts 115 and 116<br>
are coupled to the terminal T1, contacts 117 and 118 are<br>
coupled to terminal T3, contact 119 is coupled to terminal<br>
T2, and contact 120 is coupled to terminal T4.<br>
If a current is impressed between the contact terminals TO<br>
and T2 in the vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd, the<br>
arrangement functions as voltage divider and no Hall<br>
voltage can be measured between the terminals T1 and T3. A<br>
bridge voltage is only measureable between T1 and T3 when<br>
device tolerances or inhomogenities, etc. occur. The same<br>
applies for the sensor element pair 106ab and 106cd.<br>
Fig. 4aII shows an electrical equivalent diagram of the<br>
Hall sensor element pair arrangement of Fig. 4aI. In Fig.<br>
4aI, for illustrative purposes, the respective ohmic<br><br>
resistances between the individual contact terminals TO and<br>
T3 are shown by dotted lines. With regard to the first<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab, a resistance of<br>
R11 results between the contact area 115 and the contact<br>
area 119 connected to the contact terminal T1, a resistance<br>
of R12 between the contact terminal Tl and the contact area<br>
117, a resistance of R13 between the contact area 118 and<br>
the contact area connected to the contact terminal T3, and<br>
a resistance of R14 between the contact area connected to<br>
the contact area T3 and the contact area 116. Analogously,<br>
the equivalent resistors for the vertical Hall sensor<br>
element pair 104cd are designated by R2i, R22, R23, and R24.<br>
Fig. 4aII shows the electric equivalent diagram with a<br>
parallel connection of the respective terminals T0-T3 of<br>
the sensor element pairs 104ab and 104cd, which corresponds<br>
to a Wheatstone-bridge. According to the wiring illustrated<br>
in Fig. 4aI and with the assumption that no magnetic field<br>
is present and a voltage U is applied between the contact<br>
terminals TO and T2, so that a current I is impressed, a<br>
voltage of<br><br>
results between the contact terminals Tl and T3 during a<br>
first measurement phase, the measurement phase 0.<br>
Fig. 4bI shows the wiring of the two vertical Hall sensor<br>
element pairs 104ab and 104cd during measurement phase 1. A<br>
current is impressed between the contact terminals Tl and<br>
T3 across the voltage U, such that the vertical Hall sensor<br>
element pair 104ab now functions as a voltage divider,<br>
while the vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd provides<br>
a Hall voltage at the terminals t0, T2.<br><br>
Fig. 4bII shows the electrical equivalent diagram of the<br>
sensor element arrangement during the measurement phase 1<br>
assuming that no magnetic field is present. For the<br>
measurement phase 1, the following results between the<br>
terminals TO and T2<br><br>
Analogously, Fig. 4cI shows the arrangement during the<br>
measurement phase 2. A current I is impressed across the<br>
voltage U between the terminals T2 and TO, such that the<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd functions as<br>
voltage divider during measurement phase 2, and the<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab is operated in<br>
reverse polarity direction with respect to the measurement<br>
phase 0.<br>
Fig. 4cII shows the electrical equivalent diagram, again<br>
assuming that no magnetic field exists. The following<br>
results for this case between the terminals T1 and T3<br><br>
Fig. 4d1 shows the arrangement of the two vertical Hall<br>
sensor element pairs 104ab and 104a during the measurement<br>
phase 3. During the measurement phase 3, a current I is<br>
impressed between the contact terminals T3 and Tl, such<br>
that the vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab functions<br>
as voltage divider. Compared to the measurement phase 1,<br>
the vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd is operated in<br>
reverse polarity direction. Fig. 4dII shows the electrical<br>
equivalent diagram wherein the following results between<br>
the terminals T0 and T2<br><br><br>
this means that by adding the measured voltages from the<br>
individual mass measurement phases possible offset voltages<br>
can be compensated. This is also referred to as spinning<br>
current, since the current feeding rotates across the<br>
contact terminals. Thus, with the described method,<br>
deviations resulting from device tolerances, such as<br>
contaminations, asymmetries, piezoelectric effects, aging,<br>
etc. can be compensated. The equations 1 to 6 show that<br>
this is possible for any resistance values, since no<br>
assumptions have been made about specific resistance values<br>
in the sensor elements.<br>
Further, Fig. 4a-d are to illustrate that only one vertical<br>
Hall sensor element pair each is active during one<br>
measurement phase, while the other is switched as voltage<br>
divider. With reference to Fig. 2, this means that during<br>
the individual measurement phases, only one side of the<br>
sensor element arrangement 106 reacts to the magnetic field<br>
lines 200, while the other one functions as voltage divider<br>
independent of the currently applied magnetic field.<br>
Thus, in the embodiment according to Fig. 3, preferably,<br>
vertical 3-pin-Hall sensor element pairs are used for<br>
implementing the second sensor element arrangement 104 and<br>
the third sensor element arrangement 106. The measurement<br>
phases described based on Fig. 4a-d can be performed<br>
independent of the spatial direction of a Hall sensor<br>
element. For using the spinning current method when using<br>
vertical 3-pin sensors, i.e. for operating vertical 3-pin<br><br>
sensors with a compensation method, two primitive elements<br>
have to be used during operation.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, which<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 3, two vertical 3-pin-Hall sensor<br>
element pairs can be connected in parallel. The same are<br>
always connected such that two of the same provide the Hall-<br>
voltage as a sensor, while the other two function as<br>
voltage dividers and reduce the offset. For example, a<br>
control voltage is applied between the contact terminals TO<br>
and T2 in the measurement phase 0, with reference to Fig.<br>
4aI, this causes the formation of the Hall voltage UH<br>
between the contact terminals T1 and T3 in the vertical<br>
Hall sensor element pair 104ab. The vertical Hall sensor<br>
element pair 104cd whose contacts are shifted by one phase,<br>
operates merely as voltage divider, and makes no<br>
contribution to the Hall voltage. The signal of the<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd is only used for<br>
reducing the offset.<br>
During the measurement phase 1, the control voltage is<br>
applied between the contact terminal T1 and T3. This has<br>
the effect that the Hall voltage is now formed at the<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104cd and the vertical<br>
Hall sensor element pair 104ab only function as voltage<br>
divider. The measurement phase 2 is the equivalent of<br>
measurement phase 0, wherein the control voltage is then<br>
applied between the contact terminals T2 and TO. The<br>
vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab then generates the<br>
Hall voltage, whereas the sensor 2 functions again as<br>
voltage divider. Analogously, the measurement phase 3 is<br>
the equivalent of the measurement phase 1, the control<br>
voltage is applied between the contact terminals T3 and Tl.<br>
Then, the vertical Hall sensor element pair 104ab functions<br>
as voltage divider and the vertical Hall sensor element<br>
pair 104cd generates the Hall voltage.<br><br>
Preferably, 3-pin-Hall sensors are used for sensors within<br>
the invention. Basically, any other vertical Hall sensors,<br>
e.g. 4-pin, 5-pin, 6-pin, etc. individual sensor elements<br>
implemented as vertical Hall sensors can be used within the<br>
invention. It is only critical that the same can be<br>
operated with different sensitivities in operating phases,<br>
or that the different sensitivities can be generated by<br>
respective modes of operation. Here, both symmetrically<br>
arranged individual sensor elements and symmetrically<br>
arranged wirings of individual sensor elements, as has been<br>
explained exemplarily with regard to the embodiments of:<br>
Fig. 4, are possible. For example, in one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, 5-pin sensors could be used, wherein one<br>
5-pin individual element each realizes an inventive sensor<br>
element arrangement, since 5-pin individual sensor elements<br>
can already be operated both in the spinning current mode<br>
and with different sensitivities. In this embodiment, the<br>
symmetrically arranged 5-pin individual sensor elements are<br>
operated simultaneously with different sensitivity, so that<br>
the oppositely orientated calibration field components do<br>
not fully compensate each other and a calibration field<br>
component and/or a measurement field component can be<br>
extracted. According to the invention, two symmetrically<br>
arranged sensor elements are also suitable for detecting<br>
both a measurement field component and a calibration field<br>
component in different operating phases that can then be<br>
extracted from the individual operating phases by<br>
respective combinations of the measurement amounts. Thus,<br>
such a sensor can also be calibrated during operation.<br>
For simplifying the description of the inventive concept<br>
for detecting spatial components of a magnetic field at a<br>
reference point, as well as the calibration and measurement<br>
method, the present description refers to a realization of<br>
a magnetic field sensor based on vertical 3-pin sensor<br>
elements for detecting the y- and x- components of the<br>
calibration or measurement field, respectively, and to<br>
horizontal sensor elements for detecting the respective z-<br><br>
components. Basically, the inventive magnetic field sensor<br>
and the inventive method are also possible by other<br>
combinations of different individual sensor elements.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further embodiment of a magnetic field<br>
sensor 100 according to an alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In Fig. 5, the first sensor element<br>
arrangement 102, the second sensor element arrangement 104<br>
and the third sensor element arrangement 106 are indicated<br>
as dotted lines. Further, Fig. 5 shows the excitation line<br>
108. As has already been discussed with respect to the<br>
previous embodiment, individual elements are connected for<br>
realizing the three sensor element arrangements 102, 104<br>
and 106. Thus, the second sensor element arrangement 104<br>
and the third sensor element arrangement 106 are realized,<br>
for example, by the 3-pin vertical Hall sensor elements and<br>
Hall sensor element pairs discussed with regard to Figs.<br>
4a-d. In Fig. 5, the second sensor element arrangement 104<br>
is realized by the four vertical Hall sensor elements 104a-<br>
d, the third sensor element arrangement 106 by the vertical<br>
Hall sensor elements 106a-d.<br>
The first sensor element arrangement 102, which has so far<br>
been illustrated as realized by a horizontal Hall sensor,<br>
has four individual elements 102a-d in the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 5. Thus, the magnetic field sensor 100<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 is a combination of four horizontal<br>
Hall sensors 102a-d and eight preferably vertical 3-pin<br>
Hall sensors 104a-d and 106a-d. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the measurement levels measured by the respective sensors<br>
are orthogonal to each other, wherein generally the<br>
assumption suffices that the measurement levels of the<br>
individual sensors run along linearly independent position<br>
vectors, so that all spatial magnetic field components can<br>
be detected.<br>
In one embodiment in Fig. 4, four vertical 3-pin-Hall<br>
sensor elements 104a-d and 106a-d are used for every axis<br><br>
running tangentially to the surface of Fig. 5, wherein all<br>
sensors are arranged symmetrically around a center or<br>
reference point 101. It is assumed that the vertical Hall<br>
sensor elements are connected corresponding to the above<br>
description and that the sensors are operated in a spinning<br>
current operation according to the above described<br>
measurement phases 0 to 3. For explaining the inventive<br>
calibratable magnetic field sensors and the calibration<br>
method in more detail, the excitation line 108 is also<br>
provided with current during the measurement phases.<br>
Fig. 6 again shows the embodiment of a magnetic field<br>
sensor 100 of Fig. 5, wherein, for clarity reasons, only<br>
the reference numbers relevant for discussing the mode of<br>
operation are indicated. In Fig. 6 current flows through<br>
the excitation line 108, and thus a calibration field is<br>
generated. In Fig. 6, an arrow indicating the direction of<br>
the field lines of the calibration field is next to every<br>
vertical Hall sensor element. Further, it is assumed that<br>
two of the vertical 3-pin-Hall sensors within one Hall<br>
sensor element pair, such as the Hall sensor element pair<br>
106c-d in Fig. 6, are operated in a spinning current mode.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates again the pattern of the magnetic field<br>
lines 200 with regard to the sensor elements 106b, 106d,<br>
102c, and 102d. Excitation with one excitation line does<br>
not seem possible at first, since the generated field acts<br>
on the vertical Hall sensor elements 106b and 106d in a<br>
positive direction at one time, and in a negative direction<br>
at another time. Considering the mode of operation of the<br>
vertical 3-pin Hall sensor element 106a-d and 104a-d in the<br>
spinning current operation, i.e. during the measurement<br>
phases 0 to 3, it becomes clear that during one measurement<br>
phase, one Hall sensor element pair each functions as<br>
voltage divider, and thus detects no magnetic field<br>
component.<br><br>
Since the two vertical Hall sensor element pairs operated<br>
in spinning current operation are only active alternately<br>
within one sensor element arrangement, it is possible to<br>
use a single excitation line 108. The current in the<br>
excitation line is switched between the individual<br>
measurement phases such that its excitation direction<br>
changes and thus excites the Hall sensor element pairs in<br>
the same direction in the respectively active state. For<br>
the horizontal sensors 102c and 102d, this means that they<br>
are excited in a positive direction in one measurement<br>
phase and in a negative direction in the other measurement<br>
phase. Thus, it is required to consider all four phases of<br>
the spinning current operation such that the complete<br>
sensor becomes operable.<br>
The following table illustrates the control of the<br>
inventive arrangement, wherein in the column control<br>
voltage the terminals of the control current impression are<br>
indicated, in the column Hall tapping the terminals where<br>
the Hall voltage is tapped, in the column excitation the<br>
polarity of the excitation current, in the column Hall<br>
voltage the sign of the Hall voltage, and in the last two<br>
columns the polarities of the calibration field components<br>
of the calibration field:<br><br>
The excitation line 108 is fed with a positive current in<br>
the measurement phase 0, with a negative current in the<br>
measurement phases 1 and 2 and again with a positive<br><br>
current in the measurement phase 3. This has the effect<br>
that a Hall voltage can be measured during a running<br>
calibration. For the vertical Hall sensor elements 104a-d<br>
and 106a-d, a change of sign of the excitation line 108<br>
takes place between the measurement phases 0 and 1, such<br>
that the calibration field is applied at the respectively<br>
active vertical Hall sensor elements in the same direction.<br>
Further, with regard to the vertical Hall sensor elements<br>
104a-d and 106a-d, a change of sign of the calibration<br>
field takes place from the measurement phases 0 to 1 to the<br>
measurement phases 2 and 3, which results in the<br>
calibration field components canceling each other out when<br>
adding all four spinning current phases. Since in the case<br>
of adding the four measured Hall voltages UH during the<br>
four measurement phases, the actual Hall voltages are added<br>
in a sign-correct manner, in this process only the portion<br>
that can be attributed to the measurement field remains.<br>
With regard to the horizontal Hall sensor elements 102a-d,<br>
the calibration field is applied to all horizontal Hall<br>
sensor elements in the same direction. This means that with<br>
every change of sign of the current in the excitation line<br>
1208, a change of sign of the respective calibration field<br>
components and the attributed measured voltage takes place.<br>
This again has the effect that during adding all<br>
measurement signals measured in the four spinning current<br>
phases, the portions of the calibration field just cancel<br>
each other out, whereas the portions of the measurement<br>
field overlay in a constructive manner and are thus, in the<br>
ideal case, adjusted for the calibration field. In<br>
practice, a reduction of the calibration field components<br>
to tolerance ranges in the order of less than 10%, 1%, or<br>
0.1% of the total measurement value is possible.<br>
In order to be able to perform calibration during a running<br>
measurement, i.e. when the magnetic field sensor is in a<br>
magnetic field, the same process is applied. With regard to<br>
the vertical Hall sensor elements 104a-d and 106a-d, the<br><br>
calibration field is applied in a positive direction in the<br>
measurement phases 0 and 1, whereas the calibration field<br>
is applied in a negative direction to the active vertical<br>
Hall sensor elements in the measurement phases 2 and 3. The<br>
calibration Hall voltage can now be obtained by adding the<br>
measurement signals from the first two phases and<br>
subtracting the measurement signals of the last two<br>
measurement phases. This results in the actual signals to<br>
be measured, which means measurement signals attributed to<br>
the measurement field, just canceling each other out,<br>
whereas only those measurement signals attributable to the<br>
calibration field overlap in a constructive manner. With a<br>
respective combination of the measurement signals from the<br>
individual measurement phases, a calibration field<br>
component can be extracted, even when at the same time a<br>
further magnetic field to be measured is present.<br>
With regard to the horizontal Hall sensor elements 102a-d,<br>
the calibration field is applied in a positive direction in<br>
the measurement phases 0 and 3, and in a negative direction<br>
in the measurement phases 1 and 2. The calibration Hall<br>
voltage attributable to the calibration field can now be<br>
obtained by adding the measurement signals of the<br>
measurement phases 0 and 3 and subtracting the measurement<br>
signals of the measurement phases 1 and 2. In this case, by<br>
respectively combining, a measurement signal, which is<br>
merely attributable to the calibration field, can be<br>
extracted since in the ideal case, the measurement field<br>
components cancel each other out completely. In practice, a<br>
reduction of the measurement field components to tolerance<br>
ranges in the order of less than 10%, 1%, or 0.1% of the<br>
total measurement value is possible.<br>
The measurement signal attributable to the measurement<br>
field component results in all these Hall sensors by adding<br>
measurement signals measured in the four spinning current<br>
measurement phases.<br><br>
Maximum Hall voltage = sum of the signals of the individual<br>
measurement phases 0 to 3.<br>
For extracting the calibration field component, the<br>
measurement signals from the four measurement phases or<br>
spinning current phases, respectively, are added as<br>
follows:<br>
Calibration field component of the vertical sensors<br>
measurement phase 0 + measurement phase 1 - measurement<br>
phase 2 - measurement phase 3.<br>
Calibration field component of the horizontal sensors =<br>
measurement phase 0- measurement phase 1 - measurement<br>
phase 2 + measurement phase 3.<br>
In principle, it is possible to provide other combination<br>
options by reversing the polarity of the excitation current<br>
and exchanging the measurement phases. According to the<br>
invention, it is generally possible to extract the<br>
measurement field component with reduced calibration field<br>
component, or the calibration field component with reduced<br>
measurement field component, respectively, by different<br>
combinations of the measurement signals. It can be seen<br>
that the measurement signal component attributable to the<br>
measurement field is theoretically eliminated by this<br>
linear combination, and only one calibration field<br>
component remains. In a practical application, the<br>
influence of a measurement field can be significantly<br>
reduced by a linear combination of the described type for<br>
extracting a calibration field component. By another linear<br>
combination, it is possible to mostly suppress the<br>
calibration field component for extracting an offset-<br>
compensated measurement field component. In practice, a<br>
suppression to portions in the order of less than 10%, 1%,<br>
or 0.1% of the total measurement value is possible.<br><br>
Fig. 8 shows a further embodiment of the first sensor<br>
element arrangement 102. Fig. 8 shows an alternative<br>
embodiment wherein two horizontal Hall sensor element pairs<br>
each are placed in a square, wherein the individual<br>
horizontal Hall sensor element pairs are arranged<br>
diagonally to the reference point 101. Here, the first<br>
sensor element arrangement 102 consists overall of four<br>
horizontal Hall sensor elements 102a-d. Further, every Hall<br>
sensor element 102a-d has four contact electrodes K1-K4. In<br>
the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the contact electrodes K1,<br>
the contact electrodes K2, the contact electrodes K3, and<br>
the contact electrodes K4 of the individual Hall sensor<br>
elements 102a-d are connected in parallel and hardwired to<br>
each other without interposed switches. In the present<br>
illustration, the contact electrodes K1 and the contact<br>
electrodes K3 of the Hall sensor elements 102a-d form the<br>
current impression contacts, whereas the contact electrodes<br>
K2 and the contact electrodes K4 of the Hall sensor<br>
elements 102a-d provide the measurement terminals for<br>
detecting a Hall voltage. The contact electrodes for<br>
supplying an operating current and the contact electrodes<br>
for detecting a Hall voltage are arranged in the individual<br>
Hall sensor elements, such that the current direction of<br>
the impressed operating current is respectively<br>
perpendicular to the direction of the tapped Hall voltage.<br>
In the present arrangement, the operating current<br>
directions in the two Hall sensor elements of every Hall<br>
sensor element pair, which means 102a and 102d or 102b and<br>
102c, respectively, are each rotated by 90° to each other.<br>
The current directions of the second Hall sensor element<br>
pair are offset at an angle of 45° with regard to the<br>
current directions of the first Hall sensor element pair.<br>
In the practical implementation of the inventive Halls<br>
sensor arrangement, the angle by which the operating<br>
current directions in the two Hall sensor elements of every<br>
pair are rotated to each other can deviate from the ideal<br><br>
value of 90°, and can be, for example, in a range of, e.g.,<br>
between 80° and 100°, wherein the angles in this range can<br>
be considered as angles of substantially 90°in terras of the<br>
present embodiment. The hardwired contact electrodes K1,<br>
K2, K3, and K4 of the Hall sensor elements 102a-d are<br>
connected to switches S1, S2, S3 and S4 that can each be<br>
switched between four positions, i.e. between the contact<br>
electrodes K1, K2, K3, and K4. With the switches S1 to S4,<br>
the contact electrodes Kl to K4 can be switched together as<br>
supply terminals for supplying an operating current IB, or<br>
as measurement terminals for detecting a Hall voltage UH in<br>
the individual measurement phases of the Hall sensor<br>
arrangement. Thus, switching the switches makes a spinning<br>
current method within the first sensor element arrangement<br>
102 possible.<br>
In principle, further embodiments are possible as well. A<br>
further embodiment of a Hall sensor arrangement that is not<br>
explicitly illustrated here can, for example, be that more<br>
than two pairs of Hall sensor elements are used. This<br>
applies as well with regard to the vertical Hall sensor<br>
element arrangements that are generally also not limited to<br>
the usage of two or four Hall sensor elements. Even in the<br>
case that more Hall sensors are used, the current<br>
directions in the two Hall sensor elements of every pair<br>
can each be substantially offset to each other by 90° as it<br>
is also the case in the embodiment of Fig. 8. Here, the two<br>
Hall sensor elements of one pair also have to be<br>
geometrically egual and closely adjacent with regard to the<br>
dimension of the Hall sensor elements and can be arranged<br>
below, next to, or diagonally to each other in the overall<br>
sensor arrangement. With regard to the geometry of the<br>
arrangement, a measure of symmetry around the reference<br>
point to be measured is required within certain tolerance<br>
ranges. The current directions of the at least two Hall<br>
sensor element pairs are each rotated to each other and by<br>
an angle of 90°/n, wherein n is the number of all used Hall<br>
sensor element pairs, wherein n ≥ 2. If, for example, three<br><br>
Hall sensor elements are used, the current directions in<br>
the individual Hall sensor element pairs will be offset by<br>
an angle of substantially 30°. The sensor element pairs of<br>
the sensor arrangement are arranged either next to each<br>
other, or in the secondary diagonal, wherein the Hall<br>
sensor elements are in pairs as close as possible to each<br>
other.<br>
In summary, it can be stated with regard to the inventive<br>
concept of the magnetic 3D point sensor calibratable during<br>
measurement operation that magnetic sensors according to<br>
the embodiments of the present invention also require only<br>
a single excitation conductor. They offer the advantage<br>
that all three field components can be measured in very<br>
good approximation at one point, wherein offsets are<br>
caused, for example, by device tolerances, contaminations<br>
in the semiconductor material, structure inhomogeneties in<br>
the semiconductor material, etc., can be compensated, for<br>
example, by the spinning current principle, and that the<br>
measurement values can then be provided with little offset.<br>
By using the excitation loop that can have an arbitrary<br>
number of windings, a simple wafer-test, which means an on-<br>
chip-test of all three sensors becomes possible. Further,<br>
by combining the measurement signals from the individual<br>
measurement phases, it is possible to allow a self-test<br>
during the running measurement operation, since both<br>
measurement signal portions attributable to the measurement<br>
field components and measurement signal portions<br>
attributable to calibration field components can be<br>
significantly reduced. Thus, it is possible to perform<br>
sensitivity calibration at such a magnetic field sensor<br>
during operation. The excitation loop itself can also be<br>
tested, since a failure of all three sensors with separate<br>
evaluation electronic is very unlikely.<br>
Further, it should be noted that the present invention has<br>
been explained using the example of vertical 3-pin-Hall<br>
sensors, but the same is generally not limited to these.<br><br>
For example, 5-pin-Hall sensors (see, e.g., DE 101 50 955<br>
and DE 101 50 950) or generally any sensors can be used,<br>
wherein circular or circular-segment shaped arrangements<br>
are also possible. With regard to the geometry of the<br>
magnetic field sensor, the used sensor element arrangements<br>
should each detect the magnetic field at a common reference<br>
point, which can substantially be obtained by symmetrical<br>
arrangements in pairs around the reference point<br>
analogously to the above specification. The measurement<br>
method, which means the compensation method and the<br>
calibration method is then to be adapted to the respective<br>
Hall sensors and their geometry.<br>
It should particularly be noted that depending on the<br>
circumstances, the inventive scheme can also be implemented<br>
in software. The implementation can be performed on digital<br>
memory media, particularly a disc, or a CD with<br>
electronically-readable control signals that can cooperate<br>
with a programmable computer system and/or micro-controller<br>
such that the respective method is performed. Generally,<br>
the invention also consists of a computer program product<br>
with a program code for performing the inventive method<br>
stored on a machine-readable carrier when the computer<br>
program product runs on a computer and/or micro-controller.<br>
In other words, the invention can also be realized as a<br>
computer program with a program code for performing the<br>
method, when the computer program runs on a computer and/or<br>
micro-controller.<br><br>
