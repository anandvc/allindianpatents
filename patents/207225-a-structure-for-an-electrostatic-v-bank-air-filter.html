				<td>A STRUCTURE FOR AN ELECTROSTATIC V-BANK AIR FILTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to air filters, and more particularly, to a structure useful for constructing electrostatic V-bank air filters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Public awareness of environmental issues has steadily increased over the past few decades. As a result, the general public now demands a quality environment with clean air in which to live, work and entertain. Various types of air filtering systems are used in residential and commercial buildings to improve the quality of the air. One commonly used type of air filter system is the "bag" or "pocket" filter designed to significantly increase filtering surface areas in an air flow passage. Another type designed for the same purpose is the V-bank filter which doubles the filtering surface area, compared to a planar filter in the same air flow passage.<br>
A known pocket filter uses multiple filter bags arranged in housing of a suitable shape. The manufacture of such bag filters is expensive because the disposable filter bags have to be interconnected using a sewing or gluing process.<br>
Pocket air filters are assembled in several ways. For example, they may be constructed of folded wire grids which are secured between end walls to receive filter material consisting of a glass wool, cotton wool or textile cloth supported by resilient removable frames.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
An example of a pocket filter structures is taught in United States Patent No. 3,691,736, entitled POCKET FILTER FOR AIR AND GAS PURIFICATION which issued to Neumann on September 19, 1972.<br>
Passive bag, pocket and v-bank filters are, however, not particularly efficient for removing small particulates suspended in air. This is especially true in environments contaminated with heavy smoke, such as casinos and bars, or industrial facilities used for welding, etc. In such environments, it has been demonstrated that high performance electrostatic air filters are superior to passive bag or V-bank filters for removing impurities from the air.<br>
Electrostatic air filters generally include a disposable filter cartridge of a charged media type and a filter cartridge holder which is provided with a high voltage power supply for charging the filter. Electrostatic air filters of the charged media type are well known and taught in United States Patent No. 4,886,526 entitled ELECTRONIC AIR FILTRATION SYSTEM, which issued to Joannou on December 12, 1989. Joannou teaches a disposable filter cartridge which is supported by a support frame constructed to facilitate servicing the filter without having to handle individual filter pads. The disposable filter cartridge consists of an inner screen of conductive material which is sandwiched between a pair of dielectric, fibrous pads. This inner screen is connected via an electrode to one side of a high voltage power supply to electrostatically charge the filter cartridge. An outer surface of the fibrous filter pads are in turn covered by a pair of conductive screens<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
which are connected to the other Bide of the power supply. These outer screens may be a part of the disposable filter cartridge or a part of the support frame, but both embodiments function in the same way.<br>
Electrostatic   V-bank   air   filters   are constructed from a pair of electrostatic air filters supported by V-shaped side panels which are installed in an air handling system.   The pair of filters share the air cleaning load of air drawn through an air intake end at a wide end of the V-shaped side panels.  Because of their air cleaning efficiency and ease of maintenance, there is a rapidly increasing demand for electrostatic V-bank air filters.  They have become particularly popular in public places with significant air quality problems, such as casinos and bars where cigarette smoke is a particular concern.  They are also gaining acceptance in animal  husbandry where  they are used for odour and disease control in cattle and hog barns,  and poultry houses.    They  are  also  expected  to  rapidly  gain acceptance in office and commercial buildings where they contribute to air quality.<br>
The Applicant manufactures and sells electrostatic V-bank air filters in which each v-bank unit includes two substantially triangular side panels with rectangular top and bottom electrostatic filter units transversely secured to side edges of the respective side panels. The filter units are constructed of extruded metal and plastic frame elements, such as disclosed in the Applicant's United States Patent No. 5,059,218, entitled CONSTRUCTION FOR SUPPORTING A FLEXIBLE SHEET which  issued to William E.  Pick on<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
October 22, 1991. While these V-bank filters perform well, sub-assembly of each filter unit is required before assembly of the V-bank unit. This is a time consuming and labour intensive process.<br>
Another example of a type V-bank air filter is taught in FIG. 7 of British Patent No. 764,080, which was published on December 19, 1956. The filter is constructed as an angle iron frame covered on two sides by sheet metal and open at its ends. The casing is adapted to be inserted in or form a part of an air duct (2) . A high voltage grid (6)  comprising a metal angle iron frame carrying offset vertically extending metal members (7) at suitable intervals is supported in spaced relation to the casing by suitable insulators (8) secured to a partition (4) so that the grid (6) lies in an inclined position across the middle filter chamber. Air flows downwardly and is divided by baffles (29) into streams that enter through the respective openings  (31),  flow  laterally through  respective  filter  cartridges  (22),  and  exit downwardly through openings (33) between baffles (32) . Filter cartridges may be replaced by removing end plate (3) , withdrawing a grounded grid  (116),  which pivots about pivots  (21)  to release the cartridge  (22) . The principal disadvantages of this filter construction are its complex construction and the many parts that must be assembled by skilled labour to ensure that there are no high voltage shorts in the filter unit.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for a structure for electrostatic V-bank air filters which facilitates manufacture and assembly of V-bank air filters to reduce manufacturing costs and decrease assembly time.<br><br>
- 4a -<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An obj ect of the invention is to provide a simple structure for electrostatic V-bank air filters.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a structure for an electrostatic air filter, which may be manufactured using simple mechanical processes and rapidly assembled from a few simple parts.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a structure for an electrostatic air filter which is assembled from components manufactured substantially entirely from sheet metal blanks using automated sheet metal cutting, bending and stamping processes.<br>
Yet a further object . of the invention is to provide a structure for electrostatic air filter which is easily serviced.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a structure for an electrostatic v-bank air filter that is self-supporting.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGs. 1 and 2 show a structure 10 for an electrostatic V-bank air filter in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The structure 10 includes a substantially V-shaped housing 12 having a closed narrow end 14 and an open wide end 16. The housing 12 includes a pair of substantially triangular side panels 18, each having an inner side 20 (FIG. 2) and side edges 24 (FIG. 2) disposed at a right angle with respect to the outer side. The side edges may be disposed at a right angle with respect to either one of the inner side 20 and outer side 22. A perforated electrically conductive top plate 26 and a perforated electrically conductive bottom plate 28 respectively have an inner surface 30, 32 and an outer surface 34, 36. The top plate 26 and the bottom plate 28 are respectively mounted transversely to the side edges 24 of the side panels 18 to form the housing.<br>
The substantially triangular side panels 18 are truncated at the narrow end 14 and a rear wall 38 is mounted to the respective edges of the truncated ends of the side panels 18 to form the closed narrow end 14.<br>
A pair of perforated electrically conductive enclosure plates 40 pivotally mounted to the side panels 18 in parallel relationship with the top plates 26 and bottom plates 28 form a pair of rectangular enclosures for respectively supporting an electrostatic filter pad 42 when the enclosure plates 40 are in a closed position. An upper enclosure plate 4 0 is illustrated in the closed position in FIG. 1 and a lower<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
enclosure plate 40 is illustrated in the closed position<br>
in FIG. 2.  Each enclosure plate 40 is enabled to pivot<br>
independently  to  an  open  position  in  which  the<br>
electrostatic  filter  pad 42  can  be  removed  for<br>
replacement.  The lower enclosure plate 40 is illustrated<br>
in the open position in FIG. 1.  The respective enclosure<br>
plates 40 are detachably locked in the closed position by<br>
locking mechanisms 44 which will be described below in<br>
detail.  An electrode 46 is mounted to each of the top<br>
and bottom plates 26, 28 at the open end 16 to deliver an<br>
electric charge to an electrostatic charging medium 56 in<br>
the electrostatic filter pad 42 in a manner well known in<br>
the art.  The position of the electrodes 4 6 is a matter<br>
of design choice.   A housing 50 houses a high voltage<br>
power supply  (not illustrated)  that generates a high<br>
voltage, low amperage output current, in a manner well<br>
known in the art.  Power is supplied to the high voltage<br>
power supply by a low voltage power supply cord 48, the<br>
ground conductor (not illustrated) of the power supply<br>
cord 48  being  in  electrical  connection  with  the<br>
respective  electrically  conductive  top  and  bottom<br>
plates 26, 28.  Each of the electrodes 46 is preferably<br>
and conveniently L-shaped and attached to but insulated<br>
from the housing 50, the insulation covering all but a<br>
tip  of  the  electrode  which  contacts  the  charging<br>
medium 56  when  the  electrostatic  air  filter  pad  is<br>
inserted in the enclosure.<br>
The electrostatic air filter pad 42 includes fibrous filter pads 52 and 54 which surround the charging medium 56. The charging medium 56 may be a metallic screen, an expanded metallic mesh or an electrically<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
conductive odor absorbing foam as described in Applicant's United States Patent No. 5,108,490 which issued on April 28, 1992, or other conductive materials. To prepare the V-bank filter for use, the two respective<br>
	electrostatic air filter pads 42 are placed into the<br>
structure 10.  One of the air filter pads 42 is inserted<br>
between the lower enclosure plate 40  and  the bottom<br>
plate 28,  and  a  front  edge  of  the  lower  enclosure<br>
plate 40 is lowered and secured in the closed position<br>
 using the locking mechanism 44. Lowering the enclosure plate 40 forces the electrode 4 6 upwardly through the fibrous filter pad 54 and into contact with the charging medium 56 to deliver electrostatic charge thereto. To ensure  that  the  electrode 46  does  not  contact  the<br>
	electrically  conductive  lower  enclosure  plate 40,  an<br>
insulator 57 is attached to a bottom surface thereof in<br>
alignment with the tip of electrode 46.  The insulator 57<br>
also inhibits electrical arching between the electrode 46<br>
and the grounded enclosure plate 40.  The filter pad 42<br>
) is inserted into place between the upper enclosure plate 40 and the top plate 2 6 in a similar manner.<br>
The panels and plates of the structure 10 are preferably and economically constructed from a sheet metal stock such as  a galvanized steel  sheet.   For<br>
 greater endurance in damp, corrosive environments, stainless steel or electrically conductive plastics may also be used. Each of the side panels 18, as illustrated in FIG. 3a, is made from a substantially triangular sheet metal blank 58.   The sheet metal blank 58 includes a<br>
  truncated triangular portion 60 defined by a front end<br>
 line 62, two side lines 64 and two rear end lines 66, 68,<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
The sheet metal blank 58 further includes peripheral edge portions 70a, 24a, 72a and 74a that respectively extend along the front end 1ine 62, Side 1ines 64 and rear end lines 66, 68.   Assembly bores 76 pierce the respective peripheral edge portions 24a, 72a and 74a.  Slots 77 are provided  in  the  peripheral  edge  portion 70a  for adjustably mounting the structure 10 to an air handling system (not illustrated) .  A pair of bores 79 pierce the truncated end of the sheet metal blank 58 near the rear end lines 66,  68.   The bores 79 respectively receive hinge pins 81, as shown in FIG. 1.  After the sheet metal blank 58 is cut to the shape shown in FIG. 3a, the edge portions  are  bent,  as  described  above,  using  metal bending techniques, well known in the art.  Following the bending process, the peripheral edge portions 70a, 24a, 72a and 74a form the respective front edge 70,  side edges 24 and the rear edges 72, 74.<br>
The top and bottom plates 26, 28 are formed from a single sheet metal blank 75, as illustrated in FIG. 4a. The sheet metal blank 75 includes rectangular central portion 78 which is defined by a front bend line 80, rear bend line 82 and side edges 84. The sheet metal blank 76 is perforated with apertures 86 to permit air flow therethrough. The apertures 86 are preferably formed using a metal stamping process. The sheet metal blank 75 further includes a front edge portion 88a and a rear edge portion 90a extending along the respective front bend line 80 and rear bend line 82. The front edge portion 88a is cut off at each end by a length equal to a width of the side edges 84. A plurality of assembly bores 76 pierce the rear edge portion 90a and the central<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
portion 78 adjacent the respective side edges 84. The number and position of the assembly bores 76 adjacent the respective side edges 84 correspond to the bores 76 in the peripheral edge portions 24a of the 3heet metal blank 58 (FIG. 3a) . A pair of bores 92 pierce the rectangular central portion 78 near the front bend line 80 for mounting the housing 50 for the high voltage power supply. Another pair of bores 94 also pierce the rectangular central portion 78 closer to the front bend line 80. The bores 94 are for mounting the locking mechanism 44, which is described below. The length of the rectangular central portion 78 from the front bend line 80 to the rear bend line 82 is equal to a length of the side edge 24 of the side panel 18.<br>
FIG. 4b illustrates a rectangular sheet metal blank 96 for forming the narrow end 14 of the structure 10 shown in FIG. 1, the sheet metal blank 96 is divided by a longitudinal bend line 98 into an upper portion 100 and a lower portion 102. A length of the sheet metal blank 96 is equal to a width of the sheet metal blank 75 described above with reference to FIG. 4a. Assembly bores pierce each of the upper and lower portions 100, 102. The number and position of the assembly bores 76 in each upper and lower portion correspond to the number and position of the assembly bores 76 in the rear edge portion 90a of the sheet metal blank 75 (FIG. 4a).<br>
The rear edge portion 90a of the sheet metal blank 75 is bent along the rear bend line 82 at a right angle with respect to either surface of the sheet metal blank 75 and the front edge portion 88a is bent along the<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
front bend line 80 at angle a {FIG. 4c) with respect to the opposite surface of the sheet metal blank 75 to form the top and bottom plates 26, 28 with respective front edges 88 and rear edges 90. The angle a is a supplementary angle of angle B, and angle B is less than 90*. The rectangular sheet metal blank 96 (FIG. 4b) is bent along the longitudinal center line 98 at an angle that is equal to 26 to form the end wall 38.<br>
To  assemble  the  housing 12,  the  assembly bores 76 in the side edge 84 of a top plate 26 are aligned with respective assembly bores 76 in the side edges 24 of a side panel 18 and rivets,  sheet metal screws or equivalent fasteners, are inserted to secure the  top plate 26  to  the  side  edge 24  of  the  side panel 18.   In a similar manner, a bottom plate 28 is mounted  to  the  opposite  side  edge 24  of  the  side panel 18, as illustrated in FIG. 4c.  The opposite side panel 18 is then connected to the top and bottom plates in the same way using fasteners 104.  The rear wall 38 is positioned on  the  rear  end of  the  top  and  bottom plates 26, 28.  The corresponding assembly bores 76 are aligned to receive the fasteners 104 to secure the rear wall 38 to the side panels 18 and the top and bottom plates 26, 28  to  form  the  closed  end  14  of  the housing 12.   When the structure 10 is assembled, the front edges 88 of the top and bottom plates 26, 28 extend  in a vertical plane defined by the front edges 70 of the side panels 18 to from a mounting flange surrounding the open end 16 of the housing 12.<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the enclosure plate 40 which<br>
is also preferably made from a rectangular sheet metal<br>
blank  106.    The  rectangular  sheet  metal  blank 106<br>
includes a rectangular central portion 108 defined by a<br>
front bend line 110, a rear bend line 112 and two side<br>
bend lines 114.  The sheet metal blank 106 is likewise<br>
perforated with apertures 116 to permit air to flow<br>
therethrough.  The sheet metal blank 10 6 further includes<br>
peripheral edge portions 118a, 120a and 122a that extend<br>
along the respective front bend line 110,  rear bend<br>
line 112, and the side bend lines 114.   The peripheral<br>
edge portion 118a is wider than the other edge portions<br>
and has a pair of spaced apart lip portions 124 adjacent<br>
the respective ends thereof.  A central recessed edge 128<br>
extends between the two lip portions 124 and a notch 126<br>
is cut in the recessed edge 128.  A pair of bores 130<br>
pierce a rear corner of the peripheral edge portion 122a.<br>
When the sheet metal blank 106 is used to form the<br>
enclosure plate 4 0,  the peripheral edge portions 120a<br>
and 122a are bent along the bend lines 112, 114 at a<br>
right  angle with respect  to  either  surface of  the<br>
rectangular central portion 108 and the lip portions 124<br>
are bent along an extension of the recessed edge 128 at a<br>
right angle with respect to the same surface of the<br>
rectangular central portion 108.   The peripheral edge<br>
portion 118a is bent along the front bend line 110 at a<br>
right angle with respect to the opposite surface of the<br>
sheet  metal  blank 106  so  that  the  peripheral  edge<br>
portions  118a, 120a, 122a  form  the  respective  right<br>
angled front edge 118, rear edge 120 and side edges 122<br>
/ of the enclosure plate 40 as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
2. To mount the enclosure plates to the side panels 18, the bores 130 through the respective peripheral edge portions 122a are aligned with the respective bores 79 through the side panels 18 and the hinge pin 81 {FIG. 2) is inserted through the bores 130 and the corresponding bores 79 in the respective side panels to form the hinge, permitting pivotal movement of the enclosure plates 40.<br>
The notch 126 on the recessed edge 128 of the edge portion 118a is formed to accommodate the electrode 4 6 which extends from the high voltage power supply housing 50 (FIG. 1) under recessed edge 128 of the enclosure plate 40. The insulator 57 is fastened to an inner surface of the upper or lower enclosure plates 40 in alignment with the point of the electrode 4 6 when the enclosure plate 40 is in the closed position.<br>
The lip portions 124 (FIG. 5) of the enclosure plate 40 are in a parallel relationship with the top and bottom surfaces of the enclosure plates 40 and, therefore, abut an inner surface of the respective top and bottom plates 26, 28 when the enclosure plates 40 are in the closed position. A pair of toggles 134 (FIG. 2) are pivotally mounted to an inner surface of the top and bottom plates 26, 28 using fasteners 136 which are respectively received in the bores 94, as shown in FIG. 4a. The toggles 134 pivot over the respective lip portions 124 to provide the locking mechanisms 44.<br>
FIG. 6 shows an alternate embodiment of an enclosure plate in which a welded wire structure 138 replaces the sheet metal structure shown in FIG. 5. The welded wire structure 138 has the advantages of being inexpensive to manufacture, requires minimal bending and<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
pre-assembly preparation and provides excellent air flow properties while being extremely rigid and durable. The welded wire structure 138 includes a wire rear edge 140, a wire front edge 142 and a plurality of spaced-apart parallel wires 144 that are separated by a gap 148 and respectively welded to the wire front and rear edges using methods well known in the art. The rear edge 140 is a stiff wire which extends beyond side edges of the welded wire structure 138 to provide a hinge pin that is inserted through bores 79 in side panels 20, 22 (FIG. 3) to pivotally support the enclosure plate as described above. The front edge 142 is bent downwardly at a right angle along a bend line 146 to form the enclosure plate shown in FIG. 7,<br>
FIG. 7 is a partial perspective view of the structure 10 for an electrostatic v-bank air filter with a welded wire enclosure plate shown in FIG. 6. As is apparent, the enclosure plate is substantially identical to the one described above with reference to FIG. 5. The wire front edge 142 is held in the closed position by the pair of toggles 134, as described above with respect to an enclosure plate 106 made of sheet metal. An advantage of the welded wire structure 138 is that it is inexpensive to manufacture and requires minimal pre-assembly shaping. The welded wire structure also has good air permeability since each welded wire runs parallel to an air flow drawn through the V-bank air filter 10. The welded wire structure 138 therefore provides very little resistance to air flowing through the air filter.<br>

FIG.  8  illustrates a structure  210  for an<br>
electrostatic  V-bank  air  filter  in  accordance  with<br>
another preferred embodiment of the invention.   This<br>
structure provides a reverse V-bank air filter for use in<br>
air handling equipment with inadequate space behind the<br>
filter  support  structure to accommodate  the  regular<br>
V-bank air filter shown in FIGs. 1-7.  Similarly to the<br>
structure 10 shown in FIG. 1, the structure 210 includes<br>
a  substantially V-shaped housing 212  having  a  closed<br>
narrow end 214 and an open wide end 216.  The housing 212<br>
includes  a  pair  of  substantially  triangular  side<br>
panels 218, one of the side panels 218 at the front is<br>
removed to show the internal structure of the air filter.<br>
Each side panel 218 has a flat side edge 224 and a wide<br>
end edge 270 bent outwardly at a right angle, which is<br>
more clearly shown in FIG. 9 which illustrates a sheet<br>
metal blank 218a used to form the side panels 218, as<br>
described  below  in  more  detail.     A  perforated<br>
electrically conductive top plate 226 and a perforated<br>
electrically conductive bottom plate 228  respectively<br>
have   an   inner   surface 230, 232   and   an   outer<br>
surface 234, 236.  The top plate 226 and bottom plate 228<br>
have respective side edges 237, 237a, 239 and 239a that<br>
are bent downwardly at a right angle with respect to the<br>
inner surfaces 230, 232,  as is more clearly shown in<br>
FIG. 10 which illustrates the top plate o 226.   The top<br>
plate 226 and bottom plate 228 are respectively mounted<br>
transversely to the side panels 218 to form the housing,<br>
using rivets or bolts (not shown), inserted through the<br>
bores 27 6 in the side panels 218 and the side edges 237,<br>
  237a, 239 and 239a of the top and bottom plates 226, 228.<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
The respective outer surfaces 234, 236 of the top and bottom plates 226, 228 align with respective dashed lines 234a and 236a shown on the side panels 218 (FIG. 9) when the top plate 226 and bottom plate 228 are mounted to the side panels 218. Consequently, the edges 224 of the side panels 218 respectively extend the outer surfaces of top plate 226 and bottom plate 228.<br>
The substantially triangular side panels 218 are truncated at the narrow end 214 and a front wall 238 is mounted to the respective top and bottom plates 226, 228 at the truncated ends of the side panels 218 to form the closed narrow end 214 (FIG. 9).<br>
A pair of enclosure plates 138 (FIG. 8), preferably a welded wire structure identical to the structure shown in FIG. 6, are pivotally mounted to pivot bores 279 (FIG. 9) in the side panels 218 by the wire rear edge 140 which forms a hinge pin. The enclosure plates 138 are mounted in parallel relationship with the top plate 226 and bottom plate 228 to form a pair of rectangular enclosures for respectively supporting an electrostatic filter pad (not shown). The lower enclosure plate 138 is illustrated in the closed position and the upper enclosure plate 138 is illustrated in an - open position for replacement of the electrostatic filter pad. The enclosure plates 138 may also be made from sheet metal blanks 106 using the pattern shown in FIG. 5, the side edges 122a being preferably bent downwardly with respect to an outer surface of the respective enclosure plates.<br>
The electrode 46 and the housing 50 that houses a  high voltage power supply are  identical  to  those<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2, and indicated by the same reference numerals. However, the electrodes 4 6 and the housings 50 are mounted at the closed narrow end 214 to the outer surfaces 234, 236 of the respective top and bottom plates 226, 228.<br>
At least one, preferably two clips 244 are mounted to each of the top and bottom plates 226, 228 to detachably secure the wire font edge 142 of the enclosure plates 138 in the closed position {see lower enclosure plate 138 shown in FIG. 8). Alternatively, toggles 134 (FIG. 7) can also be used to secure the upper and lower enclosure plates in the closed position.<br>
The sheet metal blank 218a (FIG. 9) includes a front edge 270a. The edge 270a is bent along dashed line 262 to form a flange 270 along the side panels for mounting the reverse V-bank air filter to air handling equipment.<br>
The perforated top plate 226 shown in FIG. 10 is made from a sheet metal blank similar to that shown in FIG. 4a, having openings 240 to permit the passage of air therethrough. The top plate 22 6 further includes a rear edge 2 88 which is bent outwardly. The bottom plate 228 has the same structure as the top plate 226, but is oppositely oriented with respect to the side panels 218. The rear edge 288 of the top and bottom plates, together with the front end edges 270 of the side panels 218, form the flange surrounding the open end of the V-shaped housing 212 for mounting the structure 210 to air handling equipment.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates the front wall 238 in  perspective view.  The front wall is also preferably made<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
from a sheet metal blank using a pressing, stamping or bending process.  Assembly bores 276 are provided in the front wall 238 correspondence with bores 27 6 in the top and bottom plates 226, 228 (FIG. 10) so that the front wall can be mounted to the respective top and bottom plates using rivets or screws to form the closed narrow end 214 (FIG. 8) of the V-shaped housing.<br>
The advantage of the structures 10 and 210 is that they are constructed entirely from sheet metal blanks or welded wire structures that may be prepared for assembly using automated machinery. Consequently, sub-assembly is eliminated and high efficiency electrostatic air filters may be rapidly and inexpensively assembled with a minimum amount of time and labour. A further advantage of the structures 10 and 210 is that the structures are more robust than prior art constructions, and are therefore better suited for commercial applications. The structures 10 and 210 also eliminate the face-loading common in dusty environments where filters with wire mesh faces are used. The structures assembled using welded wire also have a further advantage, because air pressure drop is reduced due to the open face and the fact that the welded wires run parallel, rather than perpendicular, to air flow through the filter structure. The structures 10 and 210 therefore provide superior structures for electrostatic air filters that are adapted for use in a wide range of air handling equipment.<br><br>
- 22 -<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The structures for electrostatic V-bank air filters in accordance with the invention are readily manufactured from sheet metal or welded wire blanks that are readily manufactured using sheet metal, or welded wire, cutting, scamping and bending techniques. The structures may be rapidly assembled from component parts without pre-assembly of the component parts. This permits the filters to be shipped flat and assembled on site without skilled labour.<br>
The electrostatic V-bank filters made from the structures are self-supporting and easy to install. The filters are very efficient, especially in smokey environments such as casinos, bars or industrial facilities used for welding, etc. In such environments, the V-bank electrostatic have been demonstrated to perform better than bag filters or passive V-bank filters.<br><br>
