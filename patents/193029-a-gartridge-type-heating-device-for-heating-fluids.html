this invention relates to a etrtridge type heating device for heating fluids particularly air or gases and nay hava ona or more such eartridges connaetad sarially or in parallel or both.<br>
Tha purpose of this invention is to provide effective heating of fluids electrically with nininuK heat loss during heat transfer. The heating device is ideally suited for heating air or gas flowing there through. As »ore than one cartridge ■ay be assembled, it is possible to have a continuous supply of heated air or gases. Progressive heating of the air helps to increase the temperature of the outgoing air to a higher level than possible hitherto.<br>
The cartridge type heating device of this invention has a hollow tubular body made of thermally insulated naterials such as ceramic fibres. The ceramic fibres nay be prepared under vacuus to prevent heat loss through conduction or radiation. The cartridge body has an inlet and outlet meaned for allowing the passage of air or gases there through. Conventional heating elements are housed in the body and held in position by elenent holders. The elements are constructed such that naxinun surface area is exposed to the flowing gaseous stream. Shape of the heating elements may be spiral, flower petal like, porcupine shaped, circular or a combination of any of these. Unlike in the existing<br><br>
Fluid heating systems or devices, the heating elements are in direet contact with almost all the molecules of the fluid flew. This, further enhances the efficiency of the heating device. Leads are provided to connect the heating elenenta to source of power supply. Each cartridge type unit has two coupling flanges located on either side to enable coupling with one or nore units. A cartridge assenbly of any desired shape or length nay be obtained by coupling individual units. Assenblies in the shape of L, M, T or C or long straight tube of the desired length may be forned by suitably coupling individual cartridges. Cartridges May be connected and to end or -through buffer tubes of the desired shape to forn a continuous straight or eurvileniar tubing systen.<br>
Method of operation of the device<br>
Air or gas suppliod to the device through the inlet means. An air blower or air compressor may be used for effecting continuous flow of air through the device. The heating elements on energisation through the electrical leads, heat the incoming air/gas by direct contact. For instance gas/air entering the first cartridge at room temperature absorbs heat from the heating element and proceeds to the second cartridge where it is further heated by absorption, convection and radiation. Progressive or step by step heating of the air/gas flow is continued as the flow passes<br><br>
from cartridge to cartridge till the desired temperature is reached. The air or gas flow may then be directed to the device or apparatus for effecting heat transfer.<br>
The progressive step by step heating of the gaseous stream inside the cartridge assembly increases the pressure, volume and the velocity of the gas flow thus further increasing the efficiency of the heating device.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a cartridge type heating device for heating fluids comprising at least one cartridge unit consisting of a hollow tubular, thermally insulated body having inlet and outlet means, the said body housing electrical heating elements provided with holding means to hold the said elements in position, and having leads to connect the said elements to electric power supply, the  said body having at least two coupling flanges suitable for connecting either to the adjacent cartridges or to entry point<br>
       of targeted heat requirement area to the outlet of an   air/gas<br>
        compressor, blower or buffer tubes.<br><br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the single figure in the accompanying drawings,<br><br>
      Reference letter (A) indicates the thermally insulated tubular       body while (B) represents the heating elements<br><br>
held in position by tht holder members (C). D represents tht eletrieal loads and E stands for the coupler flanges.<br>
Even though the above doscription is with reference to a specific embodiment equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope and ambit of this invention and the appended clains.<br><br>

flower petal shape.<br>
4.      The   heating   device   as   claimed   in   claims   1   and   2,<br>
	wherein the heating elements have coil shape or needle<br>
	shape.<br><br><br><br>
5.	The heating device as claimed in any one of the<br>
previous claims, wherein at least two cartridge units are<br>
connected parallely through their coupling flanges.<br>
6.	The heating device as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
individual cartridges units are connected through the<br>
coupling flanges to have a shape of T, M or L or C.<br>
7.	The heating device as claimed in claims 1, 5 and 6<br>
wherein buffer tubes are provided to interconnect the<br>
cartridge units and the cartridge units are connected<br>
serially, parallely or both to form a continuous straight<br>
and/or curvilinear tubing system.<br>
8.	The heating device as claimed in any of the above<br>
claims, wherein the inlet means is connected to a source<br>
of supply of gas such as an air blower/air compressor.<br>
	9.      A   cartridge   type   heating   device   for   heating   fluids,<br>
substantially  as  hereinabove  described  and  illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings.</td>
