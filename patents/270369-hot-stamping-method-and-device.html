Section 10<br>
TITLE<br>
HOT-STAMPING METHOD AND DEVICE<br>
APPLICANT<br>
MADAG PRINTING SYSTEMS AG<br>
Lerzenstrasse 8,<br>
8953 Dietikon ,<br>
Switzerland<br>
Nationality: Switzerland<br>
The following specification perticularly describes and ascertains<br>
the natures of this invention and the mnner in which it is to be performed<br>
DATTA &amp; ASSOCIATES<br>
Calcutta<br><br>
For advertising purposes, especially in cosmetics,<br>
containers and their closures are colored and printed.<br>
This applies, for example, to lipsticks, mascaras,<br>
tubes of cream, shampoo bottles, etc. The "hot-stamping<br>
method" is frequently used for imprints of this type<br>
and, in particular, for metal-colored imprints.<br>
For hot stamping, a hot-stamping foil is pressed for a<br>
certain time and at a predetermined pressure by a<br>
heated printing plate onto a part for stamping which is<br>
to be stamped. A color coat which is located on the<br>
foil is transferred to the part for stamping using the<br>
raised points of the printing plate that form the<br>
actual stamping mold. In a variant of the hot-stamping<br>
operation, use is made of printing plates without a<br>
stamping mold, said printing plates acting on the<br>
raised shapes of the part for stamping and transferring<br>
the color coat of the foil thereto. In principle, use<br>
is made of flat or cylindrical printing plates which<br>
are arranged in a fixed or movable manner.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is a hot-<br>
stamping method according to the features of the<br>
preamble of claim 1 and a hot-stamping device according<br>
to the features of claim 7 and printing plates<br>
according to the features of claim IS.<br>
A particular form of the hot-stamping method is rolling<br>
stamping. In this case, a cylindrical printing plate<br>
which is mounted rotatably about its axis of rotation<br>
and a part for stamping are supplied to each other. For<br>
this purpose, the part for stamping and/or the printing<br>
plate are fastened on slides which are movable in a<br>
translatory manner and can be moved relative to each<br>
other in a translatory manner on said slides. If the<br>
part for stamping and the printing plate are brought<br>
into a position with respect to each other, then the<br><br>
actual stamping operation can begin, in which the<br>
cylindrical printing plate rotates about its axis such<br>
that the predetermined transfer of the color from the<br>
foil to the part for stamping takes place by means of<br>
the stamping mold of the printing plate - or to a<br>
raised shape of the part for stamping in the case of a<br>
printing plate without a stamping mold. The rolling<br>
speed of the printing plate, the stamping pressure and<br>
the temperature of the printing plate are coordinated<br>
with the stamping foil and the part for stamping.<br>
The part for stamping here may be a body which is<br>
intended to undergo a stamping only on one side, and<br>
therefore, for the rolling stamping, either the<br>
rotational movement of the printing plate about its<br>
axis is combined with a translatory movement, or else<br>
the part for stamping, like the printing plate, is a<br>
rotationally symmetrical body and is intended to<br>
undergo stamping over its entire circumference, and<br>
therefore, for the actual stamping operation, the part<br>
for stamping is likewise set into rotation and the<br>
printing plate and part for stamping thereby roll over<br>
each other and the stamping takes place in this manner.<br>
The surface speeds of the part for stamping and of the<br>
printing plate are in each case coordinated with each<br>
other. If required, an adaptation to the external<br>
geometry of the part for stamping can take place during<br>
the stamping operation by means of a corresponding<br>
translatory movement of the slide of the part for<br>
stamping or of the slide of the printing plate, and<br>
therefore the stamping always takes place at a constant<br>
stamping pressure.<br>
Since the stamping temperature may destroy the foil if<br>
the application time is too long, after the stamping<br>
operation the printing plate has to be removed from the<br>
stamping position in the direct vicinity of the foil<br>
for the period of time during which the stamped part is<br>
removed and a next part for stamping is brought into<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
position. After the stamping operation, the advancing<br>
devices and the slides of the printing plate and of the<br>
part for stamping are therefore returned into their<br>
starting position. The next part for stamping and the<br>
stamping foil are subsequently provided for a next<br>
stamping operation and the process begins again.<br>
By means of the movement of the slide or of the slides,<br>
masses are accelerated and moved with each stamping<br>
operation. After the stamping operation, said<br>
components have to be set back again into their<br>
starting position. This operation requires driving<br>
energy, can trigger oscillations and requires time. As<br>
a result, the capacity of a stamping installation is<br>
substantially affected and limited. The service life of<br>
the device is reduced and the outlay on maintenance<br>
increased. In addition, the radial positioning of a<br>
round printing plate with respect to the part for<br>
stamping is possible only to a limited extent, which<br>
may have a negative effect on the stamping accuracy.<br>
With this type of hot-stamping devices, only parts for<br>
stamping which are intended to undergo stamping over<br>
their entire circumference or over their entire length<br>
on their side facing the printing plate can therefore<br>
be processed.<br>
It is therefore the aim of the invention presented to<br>
develop the known devices and method and to avoid the<br>
disadvantages discussed. It is a further aim to expand<br>
the possibilities of use and to make them more<br>
flexible. The throughput numbers are to be increased.<br>
It is likewise the aim of the invention to increase the<br>
service life and/or to reduce the outlay on<br>
maintenance.<br>
These aims are achieved by a method according to claim<br>
1 and a device according to claim 7. Printing plates<br>
according to claim 19 furthermore contribute to<br>
achieving the aims.<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
The hot-stamping method according to the invention<br>
which is presented here and the hot-stamping device<br>
according to the invention achieve these aims by virtue<br>
of the fact that, between the individual stamping<br>
operations, the printing plate and part for stamping do<br>
not undergo any abrupt change in direction at least in<br>
the region of a stamping axis, but rather those<br>
surfaces of the printing plate and part for stamping<br>
which are intended for the stamping move simultaneously<br>
and relative to each other into and out again from a<br>
stamping plane which is approximately perpendicular to<br>
the stamping axis on defined, uniform paths of<br>
movement, with said paths of movement intersecting the<br>
stamping axis during the stamping operation.<br>
Owing to the fact that the printing plate moves on a<br>
closed, preferably approximately ellipsoidal or<br>
circular path of movement, to be precise during the<br>
entire cycle, i.e. while it is being brought into the<br>
stamping position, during the stamping and even as it<br>
is being guided back into the starting position, it is<br>
possible for the abrupt changes in direction in the<br>
region of the stamping axis and therefore vibrations<br>
and oscillations to be avoided. So that the stamping<br>
always takes place at a constant stamping pressure, if<br>
necessary, during the stamping operation, an adaptation<br>
may take place to the external geometry of the part for<br>
stamping by combining the movement of the printing<br>
plate and/or of the part for stamping on the<br>
respective, closed, uniform path of movement with a<br>
translatory movement along the stamping axis.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the extent of the<br>
path of movement is selected to be greater than a<br>
length, which extends along the extent, of that surface<br>
of the printing plate which is intended for the<br>
stamping. In this manner, the time between the printing<br>
plate moving out of the stamping plane and the printing<br>
- B -<br><br>
plate entering the stamping plane again can be used in<br>
order to place a next part for stamping into the<br>
stamping plane and to bring the stamping foil into the<br>
required position.<br>
If, instead of a single printing plate, a number n of<br>
printing plates, where n = 1, 2, 3, ..., circulate on the<br>
path of movement, and if a section which is free from<br>
printing plates is provided between each of the<br>
printing plates, then a period of time tl, in which a<br>
section which is free from printing plates passes in<br>
each case through the stamping plane, can be selected<br>
in such a manner that the time tl corresponds to a<br>
period of time t2 in which a next part for stamping is<br>
supplied to the stamping plane.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the circulating<br>
speed and the position of the printing plate or of the<br>
printing plates can be adjusted in a specific manner at<br>
any time, since this increases the stamping accuracy.<br>
If the circulating speed, position and positioning of<br>
parts for stamping can be adjusted at any time, this<br>
also has an effect on the stamping accuracy, and the<br>
rolling hot-stamping method according to the invention<br>
can also be used to stamp parts for stamping which are<br>
intended to undergo stamping only on part of their<br>
circumference or on their side which faces the printing<br>
plate.<br>
If the length of the sections which are free from<br>
printing plates and the time t2 which is required for<br>
the supplying of a next part for stamping are<br>
coordinated well with each other, then it is possible<br>
to keep the adjustable circulating speed of the<br>
printing plates on their path of movement virtually<br>
constant. "Adaptive controls" may be particularly<br>
expediently used for this.<br>
~ 6 -<br><br>
The hot-stamping method described can very<br>
advantageously be carried out on a hot-stamping device<br>
according to the invention with a supply of parts for<br>
stamping and at least one printing plate. In the device<br>
according to the invention, the at least one printing<br>
plate is mounted movably in a printing plate holder<br>
and/or each part for stamping is mounted movably by<br>
means of its respective surface which is intended for<br>
the stamping in a receptacle of the supply of parts for<br>
stamping in such a manner that those surfaces of the<br>
part for stamping and of the printing plate which are<br>
intended for the stamping can be brought into operative<br>
connection with each other in a stamping plane. In this<br>
case, a stamping foil with material which is to be<br>
stamped on is arranged between the part for stamping<br>
and the printing plate in such a manner that, during<br>
the operative connection, the material which is to be<br>
stamped on can be stamped onto the part for stamping<br>
with the aid of the printing plate and a stamping force<br>
necessary for the stamping acts in a stamping axis<br>
approximately perpendicular to the stamping plane. For<br>
those surfaces of the printing plate and part for<br>
stamping which are intended for the stamping, the<br>
device has a respective path of movement, which paths<br>
of movement have a uniform, defined course and each<br>
intersect the stamping axis approximately in the<br>
stamping plane. With the aid of a control, the part for<br>
stamping and the printing plate are coordinated with<br>
each other on their respective paths of movement and<br>
are movable relative to each other in such a manner<br>
that they can be brought into operative connection with<br>
each other in the stamping plane.<br>
The paths of movement of the hot-stamping device<br>
according to the invention are free from abrupt changes<br>
in direction at least in the region of the stamping<br>
plane and are particularly advantageously designed as a<br>
closed, preferably ellipsoidal or circular curve. This<br>
avoids mass accelerations between the stamping<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
operations and oscillations and vibrations possibly-<br>
resulting therefrom. The path of movement of the<br>
printing plate is advantageously greater than a length,<br>
which extends along the path of movement, of that<br>
surface of the printing plate which is intended for the<br>
stamping. In this manner, the time between the printing<br>
plate being guided out of the stamping plane and the<br>
printing plate being supplied again to the stamping<br>
plane can be used in order to place a next part for<br>
stamping into the stamping position in the stamping<br>
plane, which makes a higher throughput possible.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a number n of<br>
printing plates, where n = 1, 2, 3, ..., is arranged in a<br>
circulating manner on the path of movement, with a<br>
section which is free from printing plates preferably<br>
being provided between the printing plates and the<br>
length of said section being dimensioned in such a<br>
manner that, in interaction with an adjustable<br>
circulating speed of the printing plates on their path<br>
of movement, it can be coordinated with the time which<br>
is required for the supplying of a next part for<br>
stamping. A further increase in the throughput is<br>
therefore possible.<br>
The device can be realized in a particularly simple<br>
manner if the printing plate holder is designed as a<br>
rotatably mounted cylinder and the printing plate or<br>
the printing plates is or are arranged on said<br>
cylinder. In such a refinement, either the printing<br>
plate itself or the printing plates themselves can be<br>
designed such that they are heatable, or else the<br>
cylinder is heatable and the printing plate or the<br>
printing plates are heatable via the cylinder. An<br>
indirect temperature control of the printing plate or<br>
of the printing plates is also possible, for example in<br>
a known manner by means of infrared radiators.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the printing plate<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
or the printing plates is or are provided with a drive<br>
and a control such that the circulating speed and the<br>
position of the printing plate or of the printing<br>
plates can be adjusted at any time. One or more sensors<br>
are provided along the path of movement of the printing<br>
plates for precise control and positioning. Said<br>
sensors can be designed in the form of light barriers,<br>
cameras, etc.<br>
The supply of parts for stamping is advantageously also<br>
provided with at least one drive and a control such<br>
that the circulating speed, the position and the<br>
positioning of the parts for stamping in their<br>
receptacles can be adjusted at any time. This control<br>
is also preferably supplied with information from one<br>
or more sensors installed along the path of movement of<br>
the parts for stamping which are to be moved. Said<br>
sensors can be designed in the form of light barriers,<br>
cameras, etc. However, positioning aids can also be<br>
provided which interact, for example, with notches or<br>
projections of the parts for stamping and thus permit<br>
positioning.<br>
An advantageous refinement of the supply of parts for<br>
stamping is a supply revolver in which the receptacles<br>
are configured in the form of mandrels or clamps.<br>
However, the configuration in the form of a mandrel<br>
conveyor or clamp conveyor is also advantageous. In<br>
such a conveyor, the clamps or mandrels are movable<br>
along the path of movement with the aid of a conveying<br>
member, such as, for example, a pulling belt or a<br>
chain. It is particularly advantageous if the distance<br>
between the mandrels or clamps of the conveyor can be<br>
adjusted in a flexible manner, since irregularities in<br>
the supplying of parts for stamping can thereby be<br>
compensated for very easily. If the mandrels or clamps<br>
are mounted rotatably about their axis and indeed can<br>
be driven in a rotating manner, then the precise<br>
positioning is particularly easy to realize.<br>
~ 3 -<br><br>
In order for the stamping of a part for stamping to<br>
take place at a constant stamping pressure, the closed,<br>
uniform path of movement of the printing plate arid/or<br>
of the part for stamping can be combined, if required,<br>
in the region of the stamping axis with a translatory<br>
movement. For this purpose, either the printing plate<br>
can be configured in a manner corresponding to the<br>
external geometry of the part for stamping, as a<br>
development thereof, or else the slide on which the<br>
printing plate is arranged with its printing plate<br>
holder executes a translatory movement of this type.<br>
By means of the above-described solution, shorter cycle<br>
times and higher throughput numbers and a longer<br>
service life are achieved on account of lower mass<br>
movements and largely uniform movements. The use of the<br>
device according to the invention and of the method<br>
according to the invention permits diverse stamping<br>
which is not restricted to circumferential or entire-<br>
side stampings.<br>
Further embodiments of the method and of the device are<br>
described in the further dependent claims.<br>
The invention is explained below by way of example with<br>
reference to figures. In the figures, the same objects<br>
are basically denoted by the same reference numbers.<br>

fig. 5 shows examples of printing plates with a<br>

fig. 6 shows a further hot-stamping device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Fig. la illustrates a hot-stamping device 1 according<br>
to the prior art, which has a heatable, cylindrical<br>
printing plate 10 which is mounted rotatably in a<br>
printing plate holder 12. The printing plate holder 12<br>
is connected in fig. 1 to a slide 14 which is movable<br>
in a first translatory direction Rl in a machine frame<br>
16. The printing plate holder 12 is mounted movably in<br>
the slide 14 in a second translatory direction along<br>
the stamping axis B, the stamping axis B in this<br>
example being perpendicular to the first translatory<br>
direction Rl. A part 20 which is to be stamped and, in<br>
this example, is of cuboidal design with a planar<br>
surface 3 0 facing the printing plate 10 for stamping<br>
purposes is mounted in a defined position on a support<br>
22 for the stamping operation. A stamping plane 24<br>
stretches between the part for stamping 2 0 and the<br>
printing plate 10. A stamping foil 28 is clamped by<br>
means of deflection rollers 2 6 between an unwinding<br>
device 18 and a winding-up device 19 in a manner such<br>
that it runs through the stamping plane 24 in the arrow<br>
direction A. On its side facing the part for stamping,<br>
- t! -<br><br>
the stamping foil 2 8 has a material which is to be<br>
stamped on and which is transferred during the stamping<br>
operation to the part for stamping 2 0 at an appropriate<br>
temperature of the printing plate 10 and<br>
predeterminable pressure. For the stamping operation,<br>
the part for stamping 20 is positioned with its planar<br>
surface 3 0 parallel to the stamping plane 2 4 just below<br>
the stamping foil 28 or is positioned in the stamping<br>
plane 24. Fig. lb schematically illustrates the<br>
heatable printing plate 10 and the part for stamping 2 0<br>
from fig. 1 in an operative connection to each other,<br>
with the stamping foil which is located between them<br>
not being illustrated for the sake of simplicity.<br>
For the stamping operation, the printing plate 10 has a<br>
surface 32 which is intended for the stamping and which<br>
is of raised design in comparison to a basic surface 3 4<br>
of the printing plate 10. For the stamping operation,<br>
the printing plate 10 is brought, with the aid of the<br>
slide 14, out of a starting position (not illustrated)<br>
offset laterally with respect to the part for stamping<br>
2 0 above the stamping foil 28 into a stamping position<br>
(indicated by dashed lines) in which that surface 32 of<br>
the printing plate 10 which is intended for the<br>
stamping and a surface 30 of the part for stamping 20<br>
that is intended for the stamping come into operative<br>
connection with each other in the stamping plane 24<br>
such that the material to be stamped on is stamped onto<br>
the part for stamping 20 by the stamping foil 28. For<br>
this purpose, the heated printing plate 10 is pressed<br>
at a predetermined, constant pressure P against the<br>
stamping foil 28 and the part for stamping 20 in the<br>
stamping direction B and is rolled on the stamping foil<br>
28 and the part for stamping 20 in the direction Rl.<br>
Depending on the composition of the printing plate 10,<br>
the part for stamping 20 and the stamping foil 28, the<br>
printing plate 10 is held at a certain temperature T<br>
and the speed of movement in the translatory direction<br>
Rl and the rolling speed of the cylindrical printing<br><br>
plate 10 on the part for stamping 2 0 and also the<br>
stamping pressure P are predetermined. The printing<br>
plate 10 and part for stamping 2 0 thereby come into<br>
operative connection with each other for a defined time<br>
tl at a defined, constant pressure P.<br>
After the stamping operation, the printing plate 10 is<br>
moved in a translatory manner, in a first lifting<br>
movement, in the opposite direction to the applied<br>
stamping pressure P along the stamping axis B in order<br>
to remove the printing plate 10 from the part for<br>
stamping 20 and the stamping film 28. With the aid of<br>
the slide 14, the printing plate 10 is guided back by a<br>
further translatory movement in the direction R2 into<br>
the starting position (not shown) . The part for<br>
stamping 2 0 which is now provided with the stamping is<br>
removed from the support 22 and a next part for<br>
stamping 20 is positioned on the support 22. The entire<br>
sequence now begins again, namely the bringing of the<br>
printing plate 10 from the starting position into the<br>
stamping position, the stamping, the subsequent<br>
resetting of the printing plate 10 into the starting<br>
position and the removal of the stamped part 2 0 and the<br>
supply of a next part for stamping 20. The removal and<br>
supply of the parts for stamping 2 0 takes place by<br>
means of a supply of parts for stamping, which can be<br>
embodied, for example, in the known form of a robot.<br>
Figs. 2a, 2b illustrate a further hot-stamping device 1<br>
according to the prior art. In principle, it is of<br>
identical construction as that from figs, la, lb, only<br>
in that, in this example, the parts for stamping 2 0 are<br>
rotationally symmetrical bodies which, like the<br>
printing plate 10 with which they interact, are mounted<br>
rotatably about their axis of rotation. In this<br>
embodiment, for the stamping operation, the printing<br>
plate 10 is brought from the starting position, as<br>
illustrated in fig. 2a, with a translatory movement<br>
along the stamping axis B in the direction of the<br>
- IS -<br><br>
stamping pressure P into the stamping position as<br>
illustrated in fig. 2b. For the actual stamping, the<br>
cylindrical printing plate 10 is brought into a<br>
rotational movement by means of a motor (not<br>
illustrated) , with the part for stamping 2 0 rotating<br>
about its axis at the same peripheral speed as the<br>
printing plate 10 either on account of frictional force<br>
or likewise in a motor-driven manner, by means of the<br>
same motor or its own motor. The stamping foil 2 8 is<br>
moved at the same time at a speed corresponding to the<br>
peripheral speed between the part for stamping 2 0 and<br>
the printing plate 10 in the direction A and is wound<br>
up on the winding-up device 19.<br>
Since the printing plate 10 is heated at temperatures T<br>
of up to 3 00°C, there is the risk that, at only a<br>
minimally longer application time than required for the<br>
stamping operation, the stamping foil will be damaged<br>
by the high temperatures and will even tear. In order<br>
to be able to remove the part for stamping 20, the<br>
printing plate 10 therefore has to be brought again by<br>
a translatory movement along the stamping axis B into<br>
the starting position. The distance to the printing<br>
plate 10 has to be selected here to be of a size such<br>
that the heat of the heated printing plate 10 does not<br>
put the stamping foil 28 at risk. This also applies, of<br>
course, to the hot-stamping device from figs, la, lb.<br>
The hot-stamping devices 1 according to figs, la, lb<br>
are only used nowadays for parts for stamping 2 0 which<br>
are intended to undergo stamping on their side facing<br>
the printing plate 10 in the direction Rl of their<br>
entire length or, in the hot-stamping device according<br>
to figs. 2a, 2b, over their entire circumference. As<br>
described above, it is necessary in these hot-stamping<br>
devices to move the printing plate 10 between the<br>
individual stamping operations by means of a<br>
translatory movement along the stamping axis B - and in<br>
the case of the device according to figs, la, lb also<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
along the directions Rl, R2; this requires time, as a<br>
result of which the possible throughput numbers of<br>
parts for stamping 20, i.e. the number of parts for<br>
stamping 2 0 which can be processed per unit of time, is<br>
limited. In addition, the translatory movements lead to<br>
oscillations in the device which have a negative effect<br>
on the accuracy of the stamping and on the service life<br>
of the device and/or on various components of the<br>
device, which increases the outlay on maintenance.<br>
Figs. 3a, 3b illustrate a hot-stamping device 1<br>
according to the invention for the stamping of parts<br>
for stamping 20. Fig. 3a illustrates the printing plate<br>
10 again in a non-stamping position and fig. 3b<br>
illustrates it in a stamping position. According to the<br>
invention, the printing plate 10 or that surface 32 of<br>
the printing plate 10 which is intended for the<br>
stamping moves in the hot-stamping device 1 according<br>
to the invention on a defined, uniform, first path of<br>
movement 36, and the part for stamping 2 0 or that<br>
surface 3 0 of the part for stamping 2 0 which is<br>
intended for the stamping moves, according to the<br>
invention, on a defined, uniform, second path of<br>
movement 38. The paths of movement 36, 38 intersect the<br>
stamping axis B approximately in the stamping plane 24.<br>
The printing plate 10 and part for stamping 2 0 are<br>
moved relative to each other and are coordinated with<br>
each other in their speed on the respective path of<br>
movement 36, 3 8 in such a manner that they enter into<br>
operative connection with each other in the stamping<br>
plane 24 and a stamping of the part for stamping 20<br>
takes place. For this purpose, the peripheral speeds of<br>
the part for stamping 20 and printing plate 10 and also<br>
the speed of the stamping foil, which is not<br>
illustrated here for the sake of better clarity, are<br>
synchronized. During the stamping operation, the<br>
printing plate 10 rolls by means of its surface 32<br>
which is intended for the stamping over that surface 3 0<br>
of the part for stamping 20 which is intended for the<br>
- \s -<br><br>
stamping and over the stamping foil located in between,<br>
to be precise at a predetermined rolling speed Va which<br>
is preferably constant, and at a predetermined<br>
temperature T and at a predetermined, constant stamping<br>
pressure P.<br>
The part for stamping 20 can again either be designed<br>
with a corresponding elevation, on which stamping takes<br>
place, and the printing plate 10 can correspondingly<br>
have a planar surface, or else vice versa. Printing<br>
plates 10 and parts for stamping 20 with a planar<br>
surface can likewise be used with an "image foil" then<br>
running between them. In addition to a colored writing,<br>
logo or image, the image film has a colorless surround.<br>
During the stamping operation, the entire contact<br>
region between the printing plate 10 and the part for<br>
stamping 20 is then stamped, but only the colored<br>
writing, the logo or image is visible afterward on the<br>
part for stamping 20.<br>
In the example of a hot-stamping device 1 according to<br>
the invention which is shown here, in figs. 3a, 3b, the<br>
printing plate holder 12 is designed as a cylinder 12'<br>
and the path of movement 3 6 of the printing plate 10 or<br>
its surface 32 which is intended for the stamping<br>
corresponds to a closed circular path. The printing<br>
plate 10 is heated via the heatable cylinder 12' and<br>
covers only part of the circumference of the cylinder<br>
12'. In the example shown here, only the printing plate<br>
10 is heatable. However, it is also conceivable to<br>
design the cylinder 12', as the printing plate holder<br>
12, to be heatable and to heat the printing plate 10<br>
via the cylinder. It is likewise possible to indirectly<br>
heat the printing plate 10, for example with the aid of<br>
an insulated heat chamber which is assigned to the<br>
printing plate holder and heats up the cylinder 12' and<br>
the printing plate 10, for example via infrared<br>
radiators, electric heating coils, gas burners, etc..<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
The cylinder 12' is driven by a motor 40 by means of<br>
which the rotational movement and the rotational<br>
positioning of the cylinder 12' can be precisely<br>
defined. In this example, a supply revolver is<br>
indicated as the supply of parts for stamping, said<br>
supply revolver being equipped in a known manner with<br>
mandrels as receptacles 22 for the parts for stamping<br>
20, with it also being possible, depending on the shape<br>
of the part for stamping, for clamps and/or vacuum<br>
and/or compressed-air devices to be used as receptacles<br>
22. For the precise positioning of the printing plate<br>
10 and the part for stamping 20 and for the<br>
coordination of the circulating speeds, the mandrels 22<br>
and the cylinder 12' are driven in a rotational manner<br>
by means of a respective motor 40, 40' . The<br>
coordination and precise positioning are ensured with<br>
the aid of sensors 42 along the paths of movement 36,<br>
3 8 and a preferably adaptive control 44.<br>
After the start of the cycle, the printing plate 10 is<br>
advanced with the advancing slide 14 (as an<br>
alternative, the part for stamping 20 can also be<br>
advanced) . The printing plate 10 and part for stamping<br>
20 then rotate in such a manner that the surface speed<br>
and rotational positioning are synchronized with each<br>
other. The stamping operation then takes place by<br>
transmission of pressure and temperature from the<br>
printing plate 10 to the foil 28 and the part for<br>
stamping 2 0 located therebelow. After the end of the<br>
stamping operation, the part for stamping 20 is brought<br>
to a halt. The processed part for stamping 2 0 can be<br>
removed and a new one supplied. As an alternative, a<br>
different receptacle 22 is brought into the stamping<br>
position by a suitable device. During this, the<br>
printing plate 10 continues to rotate on the side which<br>
faces away from the part for stamping 20, and the<br>
stamped part can easily be guided away and a next part<br>
for stamping supplied. At the correct time, the surface<br>
speed and rotational positioning of the part for<br>
- 17-<br><br>
stamping and the printing plate are in turn<br>
synchronized with each other and the next stamping<br>
carried out.<br>
The advancing slide 14 with the printing plate 10 is<br>
not reset between the individual stamping operations.<br>
The necessary free positioning between the printing<br>
plate 10 and the part for stamping 20 is achieved along<br>
the path of movement 3 6 by that section 45 of the<br>
cylinder 12' which is not covered by the printing plate<br>
10. Only when the installation is at a full standstill<br>
is the advancing slide 14 reset.<br>
During the continuous operation, the speed of the<br>
cylinder 12' between the end of the stamping operation<br>
and renewed beginning of the stamping operation is<br>
calculated and optimized on the basis of the average<br>
cycle time by the adaptive control 44, and therefore<br>
the rotation of the cylinder 12' which is as uniform as<br>
possible can take place.<br>
In the case of non-cylindrical parts for stamping 20',<br>
20' as illustrated in fig. 4, the adaptation to the<br>
shape or external geometry of the part for stamping<br>
20', 20' takes place by combining the movement of the<br>
printing plate 10 on its uniform path of movement 3 6<br>
and the translatory movement of the advancing side 14<br>
with the printing plate holder 12/12' and the printing<br>
plate 10. For this purpose, the part for stamping has<br>
first of all to be precisely measured and the precise<br>
movement then prescribed for the slide, for example by<br>
means of corresponding programming. Of course, a<br>
translatory movement can be combined with the part for<br>
stamping 20 instead of with the printing plate 10.<br>
A further possibility of stamping non-cylindrical parts<br>
for stamping 20', 20', as illustrated in fig. 4, is to<br>
adapt the surface topography of the printing plate 10<br>
used such that it corresponds to the external geometry<br>
~ \S -<br><br>
of the part for stamping 20, as illustrated in the<br>
printing plates 10 in fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further embodiment of the hot-stamping<br>
device 1 according to the invention which is<br>
constructed in principle in the same manner as the hot-<br>
stamping device 1 from figs. 3a, 3b. In contrast to the<br>
hot-stamping device 1 in figs. 3a, 3b, the supply of<br>
parts for stamping is designed in this example, instead<br>
of in the form of a revolver, in the form of a conveyor<br>
48 with a conveying member 46 which, in this special<br>
case, is configured as a chain. Furthermore, in this<br>
example, the printing plate holder 12 is configured as<br>
a cylinder 12' with a very large diameter and printing<br>
plates 10 which are spaced apart from one another by<br>
means of equally sized sections 45 which are free from<br>
printing plates are arranged on the circumference of<br>
the cylinder. However, it is also conceivable likewise<br>
to move the printing plates 10 by means of a conveyor<br>
instead of on a cylinder. In the example shown here,<br>
the printing plates 10 are relatively flat and can<br>
therefore be heated individually. The time tl which<br>
sections 45 which are free from printing plates require<br>
to pass through the stamping plane 24 in the<br>
intersecting region with the stamping axis B and the<br>
time t2 which is required for the supply of a next part<br>
for stamping 2 0 are again coordinated with each other<br>
by means of a control (not illustrated) in such a<br>
manner that it is possible to keep the adjustable<br>
circulating speed of the printing plates 10 on their<br>
path of movement 3 6 virtually constant.<br>
The embodiments illustrated in the figures serve to<br>
clearly explain the invention by way of examples. It is<br>
clear to a person skilled in the art that there are<br>
further possibilities of configuring the invention. It<br>
is also clear to a person skilled in the art how the<br>
elements shown in the various figures can be<br>
expediently combined, and therefore the examples shown<br>
- i9 -<br><br>
in the figures do not have any restricting effect<br>
whatsoever.<br>
