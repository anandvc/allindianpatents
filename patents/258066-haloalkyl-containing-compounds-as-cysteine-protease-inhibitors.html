				<td>HALOALKYL CONTAINING COMPOUNDS AS CYSTEINE BOTEASE 	INHIBITORS<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds that are inhibitors of cysteine proteases,<br>
in particular, cathepsins B, K, L, F, and S and are therefore useful in treating diseases mediated<br>
by these proteases. The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising these compounds and processes for preparing them.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Cysteine proteases represent a class of peptidases characterized by the presence of a<br>
cysteine residue in the catalytic site of the enzyme. Cysteine proteases are associated with the<br>
normal degradation and processing of proteins. The aberrant activity of cysteine proteases, e.g.,<br>
as a result of increased expression or enhanced activation, however, may have pathological<br>
consequences. In this regard, certain cysteine proteases are associated with a number of disease<br>
states, including arthritis, muscular dystrophy, inflammation, tumor invasion,<br>
glomerulonephritis, malaria, periodontal disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy and others. For<br>
example, increased cathepsin B levels and redistribution of the enzyme are found in tumors;<br>
thus, suggesting a role for the enzyme in tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition, aberrant<br>
cathepsin B activity is implicated in such disease states as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,<br>
Pneumocystis carinii, acute pancreatitis, inflammatory airway disease and bone and joint<br>
disorders.	*s<br>
The prominent expression of cathepsin K in osteoclasts and osteoclast-related<br>
multinucleated cells and its high collagenolytic activity suggest that the enzyme is involved in<br>
ososteoclast-mediated bone resorption and, hence, in bone abnormalities such as occurs in<br>
osteoporosis. In addition, cathepsin K expression in the lung and its elastinolytic activity<br>
suggest that the enzyme plays a role in pulmonary disorders as well.<br>
Cathepsin L is implicated in normal lysosomal proteolysis as well as several disease<br>
states, including, but not limited to, metastasis of melanomas. Cathepsin S is implicated in<br>
Alzheimer's disease and certain autoimmune disorders, including, but not limited to juvenile<br>
onset diabetes, multiple sclerosis, pemphigus vulgaris, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis,<br>
systemic lupus erythemotasus, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathic pain, and Hashimoto's<br>
thyroiditis. In addition, cathepsin S is implicated in: allergic disorders, including, but not<br>
limited to asthma; and allogeneic immune reponses, including, but not limited to, rejection of<br><br>
organ transplants or tissue grafts.<br>
In view of the number of diseases wherein it is recognized that an increase in cysteine<br>
protease activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptomatology of the disease, molecules<br>
which inhibit the activity of this class of enzymes, in particular molecules which inhibitor<br>
cathepsins B, K, L, F, and/or S, will therefore be useful as therapeutic agents.<br>

"Disease" specifically includes any unhealthy condition of an animal or part thereof and<br>
includes an unhealthy condition that may be caused by, or incident to, medical or veterinary<br>
therapy applied to that animal, i.e., the "side effects" of such therapy.<br>
"Deleterious immune response" means an immune response that prevents effective<br>
treatment of a patient or causes disease in a patient As an example, dosing a patient with a<br>
murine antibody either as a therapy or a diagnostic agent causes the production of human<br>
antimouse antibodies that prevent or interfere with subsequent treatments. The incidence of<br>
antibody formation versus pure murine monoclonals can exceed 70%. (see Khazaeli, M. B. et al.<br>
J. Immunother. 1994, 75, pp 42-52; Diliman R. O. et al. Cancer Biother. 1994,9, pp 17-28; and<br>
Reinsberg, J. Hybridoma. 1995,14, pp 205-208). Additional examples of known agents that<br>
suffer from deleterious immune responses are blood-clotting factors such as factor VIII. When<br>
administered to hemophilia A patients, factor VIII restores the ability of the blood to clot.<br>
Although factor VIII is a human protein, it still elicits an immune response in hemophiliacs as<br>
endogenous factor VIII is not present in their blood and thus it appears as a foreign antigen to<br>
the immune system. Approximately 29-33% of new patients will produce antibodies that bind<br>
and neutralize the therapeutically administered factor VIII (see Lusher J. M. Semin Thromb<br>
Hemost. 2002,28(3), pp 273-276). These neutralizing antibodies require the administration of<br>
larger amounts of factor VIII in order to maintain normal blood clotting parameters; an<br><br>
expensive regimen of treatment in order to induce immune tolerance (see Briet £ et al. Adv.<br>
Exp. Med Bio. 2001,489, pp 89-97). Another immunogenic example is adenoviral vectors.<br>
Retroviral therapy remains experimental and is of limited utility. One reason is that the<br>
application of a therapeutic virus generates an immune response capable of blocking any<br>
subsequent administration of the same or similar virus (see ylping Yang et al. J. of Virology.<br>
1995,69, pp 2004-2015). This ensures that retroviral therapies must be based on the transient<br>
expression of a protein or the direct incorporation of viral sequence into the host genome.<br>
Directed research has identified multiple viral neutralizing epitopes recognized by host<br>
antibodies (see Hanne, Gahery-Segard et al. J. of Virology 1998. 72, pp 2388-2397) suggesting<br>
that viral modifications will not be sufficient to overcome this obstacle. This invention will<br>
enable a process whereby an adenoviral therapy will have utility for repeated application.<br>
Another example of an immunogenic agent that elicits neutralizing antibodies is the well-known<br>
cosmetic agent Botox. Botulin toxin protein, is purified from the fermentation of Clostridium<br>
botulinum. As a therapeutic agent, it is used for muscle disorders such as cervical dystonia in<br>
addition to cosmetic application. After repeated exposure patients generate neutralizing<br>
antibodies to the toxin that results in reduced efficacy (see Birklein F. et al. Arm Neurol. 2002,<br>
52, pp 68-73 and Rollnik, J. D. et al. Neurol. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2001,2001(3), pp 2-4). A<br>
"deleterious immune response" also encompasses diseases caused by therapeutic agents. A<br>
specific example of this is the immune response to therapy with recombinant human<br>
erythropoietin (EPO). Erythropoeitin is used to stimulate the growth or red cells and restore red<br>
blood cell counts in patients who have undergone chemotherapy or dialysis. A small percentage<br>
of patients develop antibodies to EPO and subsequently are unresponsive to both therapeutically<br>
administered EPO and their own endogenous EPO (see Casadevall, N. et al., NEJM. 2002,346,<br>
pp 469-475). They contract a disorder, pure red cell aplasia, in which red blood cell production<br>
is severely diminished (see Gershon S. K. et. al. NEJM. 2002,346, pp 1584-1586). This<br>
complication of EPO therapy is lethal if untreated. Another specific example is the murine<br>
antibody, OKT3 (a.k.a., Orthoclone) a monoclonal antibody directed towards CD-3 domain of<br>
activated T-cells. In clinical trials 20-40% of patients administered OKT3 produce antibodies<br>
versus the therapy. These antibodies besides neutralizing the therapy also stimulate a strong<br>
host immune reaction. The immune reaction is severe enough that patients with high titers of<br>
human anti-mouse antibodies are specifically restricted from taking the drug (see Orthoclone<br>
package label). A final example is a human antibody therapeutic. Humira® is a monoclonal<br>
antibody directed against TNF and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis patients. When taken<br>
alone -12% of patients develop neutralizing antibodies. In addition, a small percentage of<br><br>
patients given the drug also contract a systemic lupus erthematosus-like condition that is an IgG-<br>
mediated immune response induced by the therapeutic agent (see Humira package label).<br>
Another example of "deleterious immune response" is a host reaction to small molecule<br>
drugs. It is known to those skilled in the art that certain chemical structures will conjugate with<br>
host proteins to stimulate immune recognition (see Ju. C. et al. 2002. Current Drug Metabolism<br>
3, pp 367-377 and Kimber I. et al. 2002, Toxicologic Pathology 30, pp 54-58.) A substantial<br>
portion of this host reactions are IgG mediated. Specific "deleterious immune responses" that<br>
are IgG mediated and include: hemolytic anemia, Steven-Johnson syndrome and drug induced<br>
Lupus.<br>

Hydrolysis of die ester group provides a compound of formula 4. The hydrolysis<br><br>
conditions depend on the nature of the protecting group. For example, when R is alkyl the<br>
hydrolysis is carried out under aqueous basic hydrolysis reaction conditions to give the<br>
corresponding acid of formula 4. The reaction is typically carried out with cesium carbonate,<br>
lithium hydroxide, and the like in an aqueous alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, and the like.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula 4 can be prepared as shown below in Method (i)<br>
below.<br>
Method (i)<br><br>
Condensation of an aldehyde of formula 6 with an aminoethanol of formula 7, utilizing<br>
Dean Stark apparatus provides a cyclic aminal of formula S which upon reaction with a Grignard<br>
reagent of formula R*MgX (where X is halo) or an organolithium reagent of formula R^Li<br>
provides a compound of formula 9. Oxidation of 9 with a suitable oxidizing agent such as<br>
Jones oxidizing reagent or HsKVCrCb, and the like, then provides a compound of formula 4.<br>
Compound 7 can be prepared by reducing a compound of formula 2 where R is hydrogen<br>
with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride, and the like under conditions<br>
well known in the art.<br>
Compound 4 is then reacted with an a-aminoacetonitrile of formula 5 to give a<br>
compound of Formula (I). The reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable<br>
coupling agent e.g., benzotriazole-1-yloxytrispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate<br>
(PyBOP®), 0-ben2»triazoI-l-yl-J\WArW'-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU),<br>
0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l -yl)-l, 1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU),<br>
l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1,3-dicyclohexyl-<br>
carbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), and a base<br>
such as iV^-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, Af-methylrnorpholine, and the like. The<br>
reaction is typically carried out at 20 to 30 °C, preferably at about 25 °C, and requires 2 to 24 h<br>
to complete. Suitable reaction solvents are inert organic solvents such as halogenated organic<br>
solvents (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, and the like), acetonitrile, A^V-<br>
dimethylformamide, ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like.<br><br>
Alternatively, the above coupling step can be carried out by first converting 4 into an<br>
active acid derivative such as succinimide ester and then reacting it with an amine of formula 5.<br>
The reaction typically requires 2 to 3 h to complete. The conditions utilized in this reaction<br>
depend on the nature of the active acid derivative. For example, if it is an acid chloride<br>
derivative of 4, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethylarnine,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, and the like). Suitable reaction solvents are polar organic<br>
solvents such as acetonitrile, JV^dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, or any suitable<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The above method can also be used to prepared compounds of Formula (I) where R8 is<br>
other than hydrogen utilizing the procedure described in method (i) above, by substituting<br>
R6COH with a ketone of formula R^'CO and then treating the resulting cyclic aminal with<br>
R8Li/R8MgX, followed by oxidation to give the free acid. The free acid is then condensed with<br>
5 under conditions described above to give compound (I).<br>
It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art, that compounds of Formula (I) can also<br>
be prepared by first condensing 5 with the TV-protected amino acid of formula 2 where R is<br>
hydrogen followed by removal of the amino protecting group and reacting the free amino<br>
compound with a compound of formula 1 as described in Scheme 1 above. Suitable amino acid<br>
protecting groups and reaction conditions for putting them on and removing them can be found<br>

formula 11. Treatment of 11 with an organic lithium compound of formula R*Li where K6 is as<br>
defined in the Summary of the Invention provides compound 12. Removal of the oxygen<br>
protecting group, followed by oxidation of the resulting alcohol 9 provides a compound of<br>

like.<br>
Treatment of 13 with a compound of formula 14 which is an aryl or heteroaryl ring under<br>
Friedel-Crafts reaction conditions provides a compound of formula 3 which is then converted to<br>
a compound of Formula (I) as described above.<br>

Scheme 4 below.<br><br><br>
Reaction of a compound of formula IS where LG is a suitable leaving group such as<br>
trifluoromethansulfonate, and the like, and R6, R7, and R8 are as defined in Summary of the<br>
Invention with a compound of formula 16 where R'-R5 are as defined in the Summary of the<br>
Invention provides a compound of Formula (T). The reaction is carried out in a suitable organic<br>
solvent, including but not limited to, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile,' benzene,<br>

collidine, diisopropylethylamine, and the like. Preferably, the inorganic base is cesium<br>
carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and the like. The reaction is optionally<br>
carried out in the presence of a drylng agent such as molecular sieves. Preferably, the reaction is<br>
carried out at room temperature.<br>
Compounds of formula 15 can be prepared by methods well known in the art. For<br>
example, a compound of formula 15 where R6 is phenyl or 4-fluorophenyl, R7 is trifluoromethyl,<br>
and R8 is hydrogen can be readily prepared from commercially available 2,2,2-<br>
trifluoroacetophenone or 2,2,2,4'-tetrafluoroacetophenone respectively, by reducing the keto<br>
group to an alcoholic group by suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, lithium<br>
aluminum hydride, and the like. The solvent used depends on the type of reducing agent. For<br>
example, when sodium borohydride is used the reaction is carried out in an alcoholic organic<br>
solvent such as methanol, ethanol, and the like. When lithium aluminum hydride is used the<br>
reaction is carried out in an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, and the like. Reaction of<br>
2,2,2-trifIuoro-l-phenylethanol or 2,2,2-frifluoro-l-(4-fluorophenyl)ethanol with triflic<br>
anhydride provides the desired compound. Optically enriched compound of formula 15 can be<br>
obtained by reduction of the corresponding halogenated acetophenone with a suitable reducing<br>

hydrogen or a suitable carboxy protecting group such as alkyl, and the like, under the reaction<br>
conditions described in Scheme 4 above, provides a compound of formula 18. Other suitable<br>
carboxy protecting and Z protecting groups and reaction conditions for putting them on and<br>
removing them can be found in Greene, T.W.; and Wuts, P. G. M.; Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
A compound of formula 18 where Rz is -(alkylene)-X'-Z can be converted to a<br>
corresponding compound of formula 18 where R4 is^alkylene^X'-R22 where R22 is as defined<br>
in the Summary of the invention by methods well known in the art. For example, a compound<br>
of formula 18 where X* is -S(O)„3- where n3 is 0-2 and Rz is trityl protecting group can be<br>
easily converted to a corresponding compound of formula 18 where Rz is R4 where R4 is<br>
-(alkylene^CO^-R22 where R22 is alkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclylalkyl, aralkyl or<br>
heteroaralkyl by removing the trityl group and reacting the resulting thiol group with suitable<br>
alkylating agent of the formula R^LG where LG is a leaving group such as halo, tosylate,<br>
mesylate, triflate, and the like, in the presence of a base and optionally oxidizing the sulfur atom<br>
to sulfoxide or sulfone with an oxidizing agent such as OXONE®, and the like.<br>

R24 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention can be prepared from commercially available<br><br>
compound of formula 17 such as lysine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, serine, and homoserine by<br>

Removal of the carboxy protecting group from a compound of formula 18 where R' is a<br>
protecting group provides a compound of formula 19. The conditions used to remove the<br>
carboxy protecting group depend on the nature of the carboxy protecting group. For example, if<br>
R' is alkyl, it is removed under basic hydrolysis reaction conditions utilizing aqueous base such<br>
as aqueous lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and the like in an alcoholic solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, and the like.<br>
Compound 19 is then converted to an activated acid derivative 20 (X is a leaving group)<br>
and which upon reaction with an aminoacetonitrile compound of formula 5 provides a<br>
compound of Formula (I). The activated acid derivative can be prepared and then reacted with<br>
compound 5 in a stepwise manner or the acid derivative can be generated in situ in the presence<br>
of compound 5. For example, if the activated acid is acid halide it is first prepared by reacting<br>
19 with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl, chloride and the like and then<br>
reacted with compound 5. Alternatively, the activated acid derivative is generated in situ by<br>
reacting compound 19 and 5 in the presence of a suitable coupling agent<br>

and in the presence of a base such as JV^V-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, N-<br>
methylmorpholine, and the like. Suitable reaction solvents are inert organic solvents such as<br>
halogenated organic solvents (e.g., methylene chloride, chloroform, and the like), acetonitrile,<br>
JV,iY*-dimethylformamide, ethereal solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like.<br><br>
Alternatively, the activated acid can be reacted with CR'^CNHyCONHa where R1 and R2 are as<br>
described in the Summary of the Invention, followed by conversion of the -CONH2 group to the<br>
cyano group by methods well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of Formula (I) can be prepared as illustrated and described<br>
in Scheme 6 below.<br><br>
Reaction of a compound of formula 15 where LG is a suitable leaving group such as<br>
trifluoromethansulfonate, and the like, and R6, R7, and R8 are as defined in Summary of the<br>
Invention with a compound of formula 21 where R3-R8 are as defined in the Summary of the<br>
Invention and R" is a suitable hydroxyl protecting group such as trialkylsilyl, and the like, under<br>
the reaction conditions described in Scheme 4 above, provides a compound of formula 22.<br>
Suitable hydroxy protecting groups and reaction conditions for putting them on and removing<br>
them can be found in Greene, T.W.; and Wuts, P. G. M.; Protecting Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999. Compounds of formula 21 can be prepared from<br>
corresponding natural and unnatural amino acids by methods well known in the art. Some such<br>
procedures are described in PCT Application Publication No. WO 03/075836, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Compound 22 where R" is a hydroxy protecting group is then converted to a<br>
corresponding compound of formula 23 where R" is hydrogen by removal of the hydroxyl<br>
protecting group. Suitable reaction conditions for removing hydroxy protecting group can be<br>
found in Greene, T.W.; and Wuts, P. G. M.; Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis; John<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999.<br>
Compounds 22 where R" is hydrogen and 23 are then converted to a compound of<br>
formula 24 utilizing a suitable oxidizing agent such as Jones oxidizing reagent, HsICVCrOa, and<br>
the like. Compound 24 is then converted to a compound of Formula (I) as described above.<br><br>
A compound of Formula (I) can be converted to other compounds of Formula (I). For<br>
example:<br>
A compound of Formula (I) where R6 is an aromatic ring substituted with halo can be<br>
reacted with appropriated boronic acid under palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling reaction<br>
conditions to provide a correspond compound of Formula (I) where R6 is further substituted with<br>
an aryl or heteroaryl ring.<br>
A compound of Formula (I) containing a hydroxy group may be prepared by de-<br>
alkylation/benzylation of an alkoxy/benzyloxy substituent; those containing an acid group, by<br>
hydrolysis of an ester group; and those containing a cyano^ by displacement of a bromine atom<br>
on the corresponding compounds of Formula (I). A compound of Formula (I) containing a halo<br>
group such as chloro can be converted to a corresponding compound of Formula (I) containing<br>
an methylthio by treating it with sodium thiomethoxide. The methylthio group can be oxidized<br>
to methylsulfonyl using a suitable oxidizing agent such as OXONE®. A compound of Formula<br>
(I) containing a cyano group can be converted to a corresponding carboxy containing compound<br>
by hydrolysis of the cyano group. The carboxy group, in turn, can be converted to an ester<br>
group.<br>
A compound of Formula (I) can be prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inorganic or organic acid. Alternatively, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of a<br>
compound of Formula (I) can be prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic base. Inorganic and organic acids and bases<br>
suitable for the preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula<br>
(I) are set forth in the definitions section of this Application. Alternatively, the salt forms of the<br>
compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared from<br>
the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt form. For example, a compound of<br>
Formula (I) in an acid addition salt form can be converted to the corresponding free base by<br>
treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, and the<br>
like). A compound of Formula (I) in a base addition salt form can be converted to the<br>
corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc).<br>
The JV-oxides of compounds of Formula (1) can be prepared by methods known to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art. For example, iV-oxides can be prepared by treating an unoxidized<br>
form of the compound of Formula (I) with an oxidizing agent (e.g., trifluoroperacetic acid,<br>
permaleic acid, perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, me/a-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, or the like) in a<br><br>
suitable inert organic solvent (e.g., a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane) at<br>
approximately 0°C. Alternatively, theiV-oxides of the compounds of Formula (I) can be<br>
prepared from the N-oxide of an appropriate starting material.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of<br>
compounds of Formula (I) by treating with a reducing agent (e.g., sulfur, sulfur dioxide,<br>
triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride,<br>
tribromide, or the like) in an suitable inert organic solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous<br>
dioxane, or the like) at 0 to 80°C.<br>
Prodrug derivatives of the compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by methods known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., for further details see Saulnier et <z bioorganic></z>
and Medicinal Chemistryletters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). For example, appropriate prodrugs can be<br>
prepared by reacting a non-derivatized compound of Formula (I) with a suitable carbamylating<br>
agent (e.g., l.l-acyloxyalkylcarbonochloridate^arfl-nitrophenyl carbonate, or the like).<br>
Protected derivatives of the compounds of Formula (I) can be made by means known to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of the techniques applicable to the<br>
creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T.W. Greene, Protecting Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be conveniently prepared or formed during the<br>
process of the invention, as solvates (e.g. hydrates). Hydrates of compounds of the present<br>
invention may be conveniently prepared by recrystallisation from an aqueous/organic solvent<br>
mixture, using organic solvents such as dioxin, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting<br>
a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of<br>
diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure<br>
enantiomer. While resolution of enantiomers can be carried out using covalent diasteromeric<br>
derivatives of compounds of Formula (I), dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline<br>
diastereoisomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points,<br>
boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and can be readily separated by taking advantage of<br>
these dissimilarities. The diastereomers can be separated by chromatography or, preferably, by<br>
separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure<br>
enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would<br>
not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the<br>
resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean<br><br>
Jacques Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions, John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons, Inc. (1981).<br>
Preparation of Biological Agents<br>
In practicing this invention several processes for the generation or purification of<br>
biological agents are used. Methods for preparing the biologies are well known in the art as<br>
discussed below.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies are prepared using standard techniques, well known in the art,<br>
such as by the method of Kohler and Milstein, Nature 1975,256:495, or a modification thereof,<br>
such as described by Buck et al 1982, In Vitro 18:377. Typically, a mouse or rat is immunized<br>
with the MenB PS derivative conjugated to a protein carrier, boosted and the spleen (and<br>
optionally several large lymph nodes) removed and dissociated into single cells. If desired, the<br>
spleen cells may be screened (after removal of non-specifically adherent cells) by applylng a cell<br>
suspension to a plate or well coated with the antigen. B-cells, expressing membrane-bound<br>
immunoglobulin specific for the antigen, will bind to the plate, and will not be rinsed away with<br>
the rest of the suspension. Resulting B-cells, or ail dissociated spleen cells, are then induced to<br>
fuse with myeloma cells to form hybridomas. Representative murine myeloma lines for use in<br>
the hybridizations include those available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).<br>
Chimeric antibodies composed of human and non-human amino acid sequences may be<br>
formed from the mouse monoclonal antibody molecules to reduce their immunogenicity in<br>
humans (Winter et al. Nature 1991 349:293; Lobuglio et al Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1989<br>

Publication No. GB 2,276,169, published Sep. 21,1994).<br>
Antibody molecule fragments, e.g., F(ab").sub.2, FV, and sFv molecules, that are capable<br>
of exhibiting immunological binding properties of the parent monoclonal antibody molecule can<br>
be produced using known techniques. Inbar et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1972 69:2659;<br>

selected front the phage displaylibrary can be isolated or synthesized, and cloned into any<br>
suitable vector or replicon for expression. Any suitable expression system can be used,<br>

Pharmacology and Utility<br>
The compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of cysteine proteases such as<br>
cathepsin S, K, B, and/or F, and in particular cathepsin S, and accordingly are useful for treating<br>
diseases in which cysteine protease activity contributes to the pathology and/or symptomatology<br>
of the disease. For example, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating autoimmune<br>
disorders, including, but not limited to, juvenile onset diabetes, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis,<br>
pemphigus vulgaris, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythemotasus,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, allergic disorders, including, but not limited to,<br>
asthma, allogeneic immune responses, including, but not limited to, organ transplants or tissue<br>
grails and endometriosis.<br>
Cathepsin S is also implicated in disorders involving excessive elastolysis, such as<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., emphysema), bronchiolitis, excessive airway<br>
elastolysis in asthma and bronchitis, pneumonities and cardiovascular disease such as plaque<br>
rupture and atheroma. Cathepsin S is implicated in fibril formation and, therefore, inhibitors of<br>
cathepsins S are of use in treatment of systemic amyloidosis.<br>
The cysteine protease inhibitory activities of the compounds of Formula (I) can be<br>
determined by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Suitable in vitro assays for<br>
measuring protease activity and the inhibition thereof by test compounds are known. Typically,<br>
the assay measures protease-induced hydrolysis of a peptide-based substrate. Details of assays<br>
for measuring protease inhibitory activity are set forth in Biological Examples 1-5, infra.<br>
Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
In general, compounds of Formula (I) will be administered in therapeutically effective<br><br>
amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in<br>
combination with one or more therapeutic agents. A therapeutically effective amount may vary<br>
widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the<br>
potency of the compound used and other factors. For example, therapeutically effective<br>
amounts of a compound of Formula (I) may range from about 10 micrograms per kilogram body<br>
weight Qig/kg) per day to about 100 milligram per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) per day,<br>
typically from about 100 p.g/kg/day to about 10 mg/kg/day. Therefore, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount for an 80 kg human patient may range from about 1 mg/day to about 8 g/day,<br>
typically from about 1 mg/day to about 800 mg/day. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
acting in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this Application, will be able<br>
to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) for treating a given<br>
disease.<br>
The compounds of Formula (1) can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by<br>
one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository) or<br>
parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous). Compositions can take the form<br>
of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions,<br>
suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate composition and are comprised of, in<br>
general, a compound of Formula (I) in combination with at least one pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not<br>
adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the active ingredient. Such excipient may be any<br>
solid, liquid, semisolid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is<br>
generally available to one of skill in the art.<br>
Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose; sucrose,<br>
gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol<br>
monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, and the like. Liquid and semisolid excipients<br>
may be selected from water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol and various oils, including those<br>
of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin (e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil,<br>
sesame oil, and the like). Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions, include<br>
water, saline, aqueous dextrose and glycols.<br>
The amount of a compound of Formula (I) in the composition may vary widely<br>
depending upon the type of formulation, size of a unit dosage, kind of excipients and other<br>
factors known to those of skill in the art of pharmaceutical sciences. In general, a composition<br>
of a compound of Formula (I) for treating a given disease will comprise from 0.01%w to 10%w,<br><br>
preferably 0.3%w to l%w, of active ingredient with the remainder being the excipient or<br>
excipients. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered in a single unit dosage<br>
form for continuous treatment or in a single unit dosage form ad libitum when relief of<br>
symptoms is specifically required. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a<br>
compound of Formula (1) are described in Example 1 below.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention is further exemplified, but not limited by, the following examples<br>
that illustrate the preparation of compounds of Formula (I) (Examples) and intermediates<br>
(References) according to the invention.<br>

To 4/-2-methoxy-oc-methylbenzyl alcohol (0.5 g, 3.29 mmol) was added 48% aq. HBr (2<br>
mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred rapidly for 1.5 h. The reaction mature was diluted<br>
with hexane (30 mL), washed with water, dried with MgSO4i filtered, and evaporated under<br>
vacuum. The crude d,I-2-methoxy-a-methylben2yl bromide was added to a solution of<br>
tributyltin hydride (0.67 mL, 2.49 mmol), Z-dehydroalanine methyl ester (0.25 g, 1.06 mmol),<br>
and 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitriIe (15 mg, 0.09 mmol) in benzene (5 mL). The reaction mixture<br>

A mixture of benzophenone imine (25 g, 0.138 mol, Aldrich) and aminoacetonitrile<br>
hydrochloride (25 g, 0270 mol, Lancaster) in dichloromethane (1000 mL) was stirred in a 2L<br>
Erlenmeyer flask under nitrogen at room temperature for 5 days. The reaction mixture was<br>
filtered to remove the precipitated ammonium chloride and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness<br>
in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in ether (400 mL) washed with water (200 mL)<br>
and brine. After drylng over magnesium sulfate the solution was evaporated to give<br>
(benzhydrylideneamino)-acetonitrile (47.89 g).<br>
Step 2<br>
A solution of sodium hydroxide (91 g, 2.275 mol) in water (91 mL) in a 2L flask was<br>
cooled on ice under nitrogen and then treated with benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride (2.0 g,<br>

1,2-Dibromoethane (23 mL, 122.4 mmol, Aldrich) was then added dropwise over 25 min, to the<br>
reaction mixture with mechanical stirring and cooling to maintain the internal temperature near<br>
+10 °C. The reaction mixture was then stirred vigorously for 24 h at room temperature and then<br>
poured into ice water and extracted with toluene. The combined extracts were washed with<br>
brine and then treated with MgSO4 and Norite. After filtering, toluene was removed by rotary<br>
evaporation to give an oil (67 g). The residue was dissolved in boiling hexane (400 mL), treated<br>
with Norite and filtered hot and allowed to cool. A dark oil separated and which was removed<br>
by pipet (~2 mL). Scratching induced crystallization in the remaining solution which was<br>
cooled on ice for 2 h. Light yellow crystals were collected by filtration and washed with cold<br>
