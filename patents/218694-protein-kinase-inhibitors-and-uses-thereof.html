				<td>PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS AND USES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry and relates to<br>
pyrimidins compounds that are protein kinase inhibitors, compositions containing such<br>
compounds and methods of use. The compounds are useful for treating cancer,<br>
neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases that are alleviated by<br>
protein kinase inhibitors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by<br>
a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with<br>
target diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive<br>
study is protein kinases.<br>
[0003] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are<br>
responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell.<br>
(See, Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. (1995) The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic<br>
Press, San Diego, CA). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common<br>
ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all<br>
kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be<br>
categorized into families by the substrates tney phospborylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine,<br>
protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally<br>
correspond to each of these kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T.,<br>
FASEB J., 9:576-596 (1995); Knighton et al., Science, 253:407-414 (1991); Hiles et al.,<br>
Cell, 70:419-429 (1992); Kunz et ai., Cell,73:585-596 (1993); Garcia-Bustos et al.,<br>
EMBO J., 13:2352-2361 (1994)).<br>
[0004] In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by effecting a<br>
phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved<br>
in a signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches<br>
that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These<br>
phosphorylation events are ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular<br>
and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress<br>
signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and<br>
H2O2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)), and<br>
growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and<br>
fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more<br>
cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of<br>
hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism,<br>
control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
[0005] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by<br>
protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases,<br>
inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma,<br>
Alzheimer"s disease and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a<br>
substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective<br>
as therapeutic agents. However, considering the lack of currently available treatment<br>
options for the majority of the conditions associated with protein kinases, there is still a<br>
great need for new therapeutic agents that inhibit these protein targets.<br>
[0006] Mammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by activating signaling<br>
cascades that are mediated by members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase<br>
family, which include the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), the p38 MAP<br>
kinases and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). MAP kinases (MAPKs) are activated<br>
by a variety of signals including growth factors, cytokines, UV radiation, and stress-<br>
inducing agents. MAPKs are serine/threonme kinases and their activation occur by dual<br>
phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine at the Thr-X-Tyr segment in the activation<br>
loop. MAPKs phosphorylate various substrates including transcription factors, which in<br>
turn regulate the expression of specific sets of genes and thus mediate a specific response<br>
to the stimulus.<br>
[0007] ERK2 is a widely distributed protein kinase that achieves maximum activity<br>
when both Thr183 and Tyr185 are phosphorylated by the upstream MAP kinase kinase,<br>
MEK1 (Anderson et al., 1990, Nature 343, 651; Crews et al., 1992, Science 258,478).<br>
Upon activation, ERK2 phosphorylates many regulatory proteins, including the protein<br>
kinases Rsk90 (Bjorbaek et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18848) and MAPKAP2 (Rouse<br>
et al., 1994, Cell 78, 1027), and transcription factors such as ATF2 (Raingeaud et al.,<br>
1996, Mol. Cell Biol. 16, 1247), Elk-1 (Raingeaud et al. 1996), c-Fos (Chen et al., 1993<br>
i?roc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90,10952), and c-Myc (Oliver et al., 1995, Proc. Soc. Exp.<br>
Biol. Med. 210,162). ERK2 is also a downstream target of the Ras/Raf dependent<br>
parnways (Moodie et al., 1993, Science 260,1658) and relays the signals from these<br>
potentially oncogenic proteins. ERK2 has been shown to play a role in the negative<br>
growth control of breast cancer cells (Frey and Mulder, 1997, Cancer Res. 57,628) and<br>
hyperexpression of ERK2 in human breast cancer has been reported (Sivaraman et al.,<br>
1997, J Clin. Invest. 99,1478). Activated ERK2 has also been implicated in the<br>
proliferation of endothelin-stimulated airway smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role for<br>
this kinase in asthma (Whelchel et al., 1997, Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 16, 589).<br>
[0008] Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and ErbB2 (Arteaga<br>
CL, 2002, Semin Oncol. 29, 3-9; Eccles SA, 2001, J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia<br>
6:393-406; Mendelsohn J &amp; Baselga J, 2000, Oncogene 19,6550-65), as well as<br>
activating mutations in the Ras GTPase proteins (Nottage M &amp; Siu LL, 2002, Curr Pharm<br>
Des 8,2231-42; Adjei AA, 2001, J Natl Cancer Inst 93, 1062-74) or B-Raf mutants<br>
(Davies H. et al., 2002, Nature 417, 949-54; Brose et al., 2002, Cancer Res 62, 6997-<br>
7000) are major contributors to human cancer. These genetic alterations are correlated<br>
with poor clinical prognosis and result in activation of the Raf-1/2/3 - MEK1/2 - ERK1/2<br>
signal transduction cascade in a broad panel of human tumors. Activated ERK (i.e.<br>
ERK1 and/or ERK2) is a central signaling molecule that has been associated with the<br>
control of proliferation, differentiation, anchorage-independent cell survival, and<br>
angiogenesis, contributing to a number of processes that are important for the formation<br>
and progression of malignant tumors. These data suggest that an ERK1/2 inhibitor will<br>
exert pleiotropic activity, including proapoptotic, anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic and<br>
anti-angiogenic effects, and offer a therapeutic opportunity against a very broad panel of<br>
human tumors.<br>
[0009] There is a growing body of evidence that implicates constitutive activation of<br>
the ERK MAPK pathway in the oncogenic behavior of select cancers. Activating<br>
mutations of Ras are found in 30% of all cancers, with some, such as pancreatic (90%)<br>
and colon (50%) cancer, harboring particularly high mutation rates (ref). Ras mutations<br>
have also been identified in 9-15% of melanomas, but B-Raf somatic missense mutations<br>
conferring constitutive activation are more frequent and found in 60-66% malignant<br>
melanomas. Activating mutations of Ras, Raf and MEK ate able to oncogenically<br>
transform fibroblasts in vitro, and Ras or Raf mutations in conjunction with the loss of a<br>
tumor suppressor gene (e.g. pl6INK4A) can cause spontaneous tumor development in<br>
vivo. Increased ERK activity has been demonstrated in these models and has also been<br>
widely reported in appropriate human tumors. In melanoma, high basal ERK activity<br>
resulting from either B-Raf or N-Ras mutations or autocrine growth factor activation is<br>
well documented and has been associated with rapid tumor growth, increased cell<br>
survival and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, ERK activation is considered a major<br>
driving force behind the highly metastatic behavior of melanoma associated with<br>
increased expression of both extracellular matrix degrading proteases and invasion-<br>
promoting integrins as well as the downregulation of E-cadherin adhesion molecules that<br>
normally mediate keratinocyte interactions to control melanocyte growth. These data<br>
taken together, indicate ERK as promising therapeutic target for the treatment of<br>
melanoma, a currently untreatable disease.<br>
[0010] One particularly interesting kinase family is the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein<br>
kinases, also known as JNKs. Three distinct genes, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3 have been<br>
identified and at least ten different splicing isoforms of JNKs exist in mammalian cells<br>
[Gupta et al., EMBOJ.. 15:2760-70 (1996)]. Members of the JNK family are activated<br>
by proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and interleukin-1<br>
ß(IL-1ß), as well as by environmental stress, including anisomycin, UV irradiation,<br>
hypoxia, and osmotic shock [Minden et al., Biochemica et Biophvsica Acta, 1333:F85-<br>
F104 (1997)].<br>
[0011] The down-stream substrates of JNKs include transcription factors c-Jun, ATF-<br>
2, Elkl, p53 and a cell death domain protein (DENN) [Zhang et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA. 95:2586-91 (1998)]. Each JNK isoform binds to these substrates with different<br>
affinities, suggesting a regulation of signaling pathways by substrate specificity of<br>
different JNKs in vivo (Gupta et al., supra).<br>
[0012] JNKs, along with other MAPKs, have been implicated in having a role in<br>
mediating cellular response to cancer, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation,<br>
immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune diseases, cell death, allergies, osteoporosis and<br>
heart disease. The therapeutic targets related to activation of the JNK pathway include<br>
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, osteoarthritis,<br>
ischemia, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
[0013] Several reports have detailed the importance of JNK activation associated with<br>
liver disease or episodes of hepatic ischemia Nat. Genet. 21:326-9 (1999); FKRS Lett.<br>
420:201-4 (1997); J. Clin. Invest. 102:1942-50 (1998V. Hepatology 28:1022-30 (1998)].<br>
Therefore, inhibitors of JNK may be useful to treat various hepatic disorders.<br>
[0014] A role for JNK in cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction or<br>
congestive heart failure has also been reported as it has been shown JNK mediates<br>
hypertrophic responses to various forms of cardiac stress fCirc. Res. 83:167-78 (1998);<br>
Circulation 97:1731-7 (1998); J. Biol. Chem. 272:28050-6 (1997); Circ. Res. 79:162-73<br>
(1996); Orc.Res, 78:947-53 (1996): J. Clin. Invest. 97:508-14 (1996)].<br>
[0015] It has been demonstrated that the JNK cascade also plays a role in T-cell<br>
activation, including activation of the IL-2 promoter. Thus, inhibitors of JNK may have<br>
therapeutic value in altering pathologic immune responses [J. Immunol. 162:3176-87<br>
(1999); Eur. J. Immunol. 28:3867-77 (1998); J. Exp. Med. 186:941-53 (1997); Eur.J.<br>
Immunol. 26:989-94 (1996)].<br>
[0016] A role for JNK activation in various cancers has also been established,<br>
suggesting the potential use of JNK inhibitors in cancer. For example, constitutively<br>
activated JNK is associated with HTLV-1 mediated tumorigenesis [Oncogene 13:135-42<br>
(1996)]. JNK may play a role in Kaposi"s sarcoma (KS) because it is thought that the<br>
proliferative effects of bFGP and OSM on KS cells are mediated by their activation of the<br>
JNK signaling pathway [J. Clin. Invest. 99:1798-804 (1997)]. Other proliferative effects<br>
of other cytokines implicated in KS proliferation, such as vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor (VEGF), IL-6 and TNFa, may also be mediated by JNK. In addition, regulation of<br>
the c-jun gene in p210 BCR-ABL transformed cells corresponds with activity of JNK,<br>
suggesting a role for JNK inhibitors in the treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia<br>
(CML) [Blood 92:2450-60 (1998)].<br>
[0017] JNK1 and JNK2 are widely expressed in a variety of tissues. In contrast,<br>
JNK3, is selectively expressed in the brain and to a lesser extent in the heart and testis<br>
[Gupta et al., supra; Mohit et al., Neuron 14:67-78 (1995); Martin et al., Brain Res. Mol.<br>
Brain Res. 35:47-57 (1996)]. JNK3 has been linked to neuronal apoptosis induced by<br>
kainic acid, indicating a role of JNK in the pathogenesis of glutamate neurotoxicity. In<br><br>
the adult human brain, JNK3 expression is localized to a subpopulation of pyramidal<br>
neurons in the CA1, CA4 and subiculum regions of the hippocampus and layers 3 and 5<br>
of the nebcortex [Mohit et al., supra]. The CA1 neurons of patients with acute hypoxia<br>
showed strong nuclear JNK3-immunoreactivity compared to minimal, diffuse<br>
cytocasmic staining of the hippocampal neurons from brain tissues of normal patients<br>
[Zhang et al., supra]. Thus, JNK3 appears to be involved involved in hypoxic and<br>
ischeraic damage of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus.<br>
[0018] In addition, JNK3 co-localizes immunochemically with neurons vulnerable in<br>
Alzheimer"s disease [Mohit et al., supra]. Disruption of the JNK3 gene caused resistance<br>
of mice to the excitotoxic glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid, including the effects on<br>
seizure activity, AP-1 transcriptional activity and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons,<br>
indicating that the JNK3 signaling pathway is a critical component in the pathogenesis of<br>
glutamate neurotoxicity (Yang et al., Nature. 389:865-870 (1997)).<br>
[0019] Based on these findings, JNK signaling, especially that of JNK3, has been<br>
implicated in the areas of apoptosis-driven neurodegenerative diseases such as<br>
Alzheimer"s Disease, Parkinson"s Disease, ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis),<br>
epilepsy and seizures, Huntington"s Disease, traumatic brain injuries, as well as ischemic<br>
and hemorrhaging stroke.<br>
[0020] AKT (also known as PKB or Rac-PK beta), a serine/threonine protein kinase,<br>
has been shown to be overexpressed in several types of cancer and is a mediator of<br>
normal cell functions [(Khwaja, A., Nature 1999,401,33-34); (Yuan, Z.Q., et al.,<br>
Oncogene 2000, 19, 2324-2330); (Namikawa, K., et al., J Neurosci. 2000,20, 2875-<br>
2886,)]. AKT comprises an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a kinase<br>
domain and a C-terminal "tail" region. Three isoforms of human AKT kinase (AKT-1, -2<br>
and -3) have been reported so far [(Cheng, J.Q., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992, 89,<br>
9267-9271); (Brodbeck, D. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999,274, 9133-9136)]. The PH<br>
domain binds 3-phosphoinositides, which are synthesized by phosphatidyl inositol 3-<br>
kinase (PDK) upon stimulation by growth factors such as platelet derived growth factor<br>
(PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) [(Kulik et al.,<br>
Mol. Cell. Biol, 1997,17,1595-1606,); (Heromings, B.A., Science, 1997,275, 628-630)].<br>
lipid binding to the PH domain promotes translocation of AKT to the plasma membrane<br>
and facilitates phosphorylation by another PH-domain-containing protein kinases, PDK1<br><br>
at Thr308, Thr309, and Thr305 for the AKT isoforms 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A second,<br>
as of yet unknown, kinase is required for the phosphorylation of Ser473, Ser474 or<br>
Ser472 in the C-terminal tails of AKT-1, -2 and -3 respectively, in order to yield a fully<br>
activated AKT enzyme.<br>
[0021] Once localized to the membrane, AKT mediates several functions within the<br>
cell including the metabolic effects of insulin (Calera, M.R. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1998,<br>
273,7201-7204) induction of differentiation and/or proliferation, protein synthesis and<br>
stress responses (Alessi, D.R. et al., Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998,8, 55-62,).<br>
[0022] Manifestations of altered AKT regulation appear in both injury and disease, the<br>
most important role being in cancer. The first account of AKT was in association with<br>
human ovarian carcinomas where expression of AKT was found to be amplified in 15%<br>
of cases (Cheng, J.Q. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Set. U.SA. 1992,89,9267-9271). It has<br>
also been found to be overexpressed in 12% of pancreatic cancers (Cheng, J. Q. et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996,93, 3636-3641). It was demonstrated that AKT-2 was<br>
over-expressed in 12% of ovarian carcinomas and that amplification of AKT was<br>
especially frequent in 50% of undifferentiated tumours, suggesting that AKT is also<br>
associated with tumour aggressiveness (Bellacosa, et al., Int. J. Cancer 1995,64, 280-<br>
285).<br>
[0023] Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
comprised of oc and ß isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes [Coghlan et al.,<br>
Chemistry &amp; Biology, 7, 793-803 (2000); Kim and Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev.,<br>
10, 508-514 (2000)]. GSK-3 has been implicated in various diseases including diabetes,<br>
Alzheimer"s disease, CNS disorders such as manic depressive disorder and<br>
neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [see, e.g., WO 99/65897;<br>
WO 00/38675; Kaytor and Orr, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 12,275-8 (2000); Haq et al., J.<br>
Cell Biol., 151,117-30 (2000); Eldar-Finkelman, Trends Mol. Med., 8,126-32 (2002)].<br>
These diseases are associated with the abnormal operation of certain cell signaling<br>
pathways in which GSK-3 plays a role.<br>
[0024] GSK-3 has been found to phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number<br>
of regulatory proteins. These include glycogen synthase, which is the rate-limiting<br>
enzyme required for glycogen synthesis, the rnicrotubule-associated protein Tau, the gene<br>
transcription factor 3-catenin, the translation initiation factor elF-2B, as well as ATP-<br><br>
citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-myc, c-myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These<br>
diverse targets implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism, proliferation,<br>
differentiation and. development.<br>
[0025] In a GSK-3 mediated pathway that is relevant for the treatment of type II<br>
dianeces, insulin-induced signaling leads to cellular glucose uptake and glycogen<br>
synthesis. GSK-3 is a negative regulator of the insulin-induced signal in this pathway.<br>
Normally, the presence of insulin causes inhibition of GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation<br>
and deactivation of glycogen synthase. The inhibition of GSK-3 leads to increased<br>
glycogen synthesis and gucose uptake (Klein et al., PNAS, 93, 8455-9 (1996); Cross et<br>
al., Biochem. J., 303,21-26 (1994); Cohen, Biochem. Soc. Trans., 21, 555-567 (1993);<br>
and Massillon et al., Biochem J. 299,123-128 (1994); Cohen and Frame, Nat. Rev. Mol.<br>
Cell. Biol., 2, 769-76 (2001)]. However, where the insulin response is impaired in a<br>
diabetic patient, glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake fail to increase despite the<br>
presence of relatively high blood levels of insulin. This leads to abnormally high blood<br>
levels of glucose with acute and chronic effects that may ultimately result in<br>
cardiovascular disease, renal failure and blindness. In such patients, the normal insulin-<br>
induced inhibition of GSK-3 fails to occur. It has also been reported that GSK-3 is<br>
overexpressed in patients with type II diabetes [WO 00/38675]. Therapeutic inhibitors of<br>
GSK-3 are therefore useful for treating diabetic patients suffering from an impaired<br>
response to insulin.<br>
[0026] Apoptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain<br>
damage (Li et al., 1997; Choi, et al., 1996; Charriaut-Marlangue et al., 1998; Grahm and<br>
Chen, 2001; Murphy et al., 1999; Nicotera et al., 1999). Recent publications indicate that<br>
activation of GSK-3ß may be involved in apoptotic mechanisms (Kaytor and Orr, 2002;<br>
Culbert et al., 2001). Studies in rat models of ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral<br>
artery occlusion (MCAO) showed increased GSK-3ß expression is following ischemia<br>
(Wang et al., Brain Res, 859,381-5, 2000; Sasaki et al., Neurol Res, 23, 588-92 ,2001).<br>
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) reduced ischemic brain injury after permanent middle<br>
cerebral artery occlusion (MCO) in rats (Fisher et al. 1995; Song et al. 2002). Indeed, the<br>
neuroprotective effects of FGF demonstrated in ischemia models in rats may be mediated<br>
by a PI-3 kinase/AKT-dependent inactivation of GSK-3ß (Hashimoto et al., 2002). Thus,<br><br>
inhibition of GSK-3ß after a cerebral ischemic event may ameliorate ischemic brain<br>
damage.<br>
[0027] GSK-3 is also implicated in mycardial infarction. See Jonassen et al., Circ Res,<br>
89:1191,2001 (The reduction in myocardial infarction by insulin administration at<br>
repofusion is mediated via Akt dependent signaling pathway); Matsui et al., Circulation,<br>
104:330,2001 (Akt activation preserves cardiac function and prevents cardiomyocyte<br>
injury after transient cardiac ischemia in vivo); Miao et al., J Mol Cell Cardiol, 32:2397,<br>
2000 (Intracoronary, adenovirus-mediated Akt gene delivery in heart reduced gross<br>
infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo); and Fujio et al., Circulation et<br>
al., 101:660, 2000 (Akt signaling inhibits cardiac myocyte apoptosis in vitro and protects<br>
against ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse heart).<br>
[0028] GSK-3 activity plays a role in head trauma. See Noshita et al., Neurobiol Dis,<br>
9:294,2002 (Upregulation of Akt/PI3-kinase pathway may be crucial for cell survival<br>
after traumatic brain injury) and Dietrich et al., J Neurotrauma, 13:309,1996<br>
(Posttraumatic administration of bFGF significantly reduced damaged cortical neurons &amp;<br>
total contusion volume in a rat model of traumatic brain injury).<br>
[0029] GSK-3 is also known to play a role in psychiatric disorders. See Eldar-<br>
Finkelman, Trends Mol Med, 8:126,2002; Li et al., Bipolar Disord, 4:137,2002 (LiCl<br>
and Valproic acid, anti-psychotic, mood stabilizing drugs, decrease GSK3 activities and<br>
increase beta-catenin) and Lijam et al., Cell, 90:895,1997 (Dishevelled KO mice showed<br>
abnormal social behavior and defective sensorimotor gating. Dishevelled, a cytoplamic<br>
protein involved in WNT pathway, inhibits GSK3beta activities).<br>
[0030] It has been shown that GSK3 inhibition by lithium and valproic acid induces<br>
axonal remodeling and change synaptic connectivity. See Kaytor &amp; Orr, Curr Opin<br>
Neurobiol, 12:275, 2002 (Downregulation of GSK3 causes changes in mirotubule-<br>
associated proteins: tau, MAPI &amp; 2) and Hall et al., Mol Cell Neurosci, 20:257, 2002<br>
(Lithium and valproic acid induces the formation of growth cone-like structures along the<br>
axons).<br>
[0031] GSK-3 activity is also associated with Alzheimer"s disease. This disease is<br>
characterized by the presence of the well-known ß-amyloid peptide and the formation of<br>
intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The neurofibrillary tangles contain<br>
hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, in which Tau is phosphorylated on abnormal sites.<br><br>
GSK-3 has been shown to phosphorylate these abnormal sites in cell and animal models.<br>
Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3 has been shown to prevent hyperphosphorylation of<br>
Tau in cells [Lovestone et al., Curr. Biol, 4, 1077-86 (1994); and Brownlees et al.,<br>
Neuroreport 8,3251-55 (1997); Kaytor and Orr, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 12, 275-8<br>
(2000)]. In transgenic mice overexpressing GSK3, significant increased Tau<br>
hyperphosphorylation and abnormal morphology of neurons were observed [Lucas et al.,<br>
EMBO J, 20:27-39 (2001)]. Active GSK3 accumulates in cytoplasm of pretangled<br>
neurons, which can lead to neurofibrillary tangles in brains of patients with AD [Pei et al.,<br>
J Neuropathol Exp Neurol, 58, 1010-19 (1999)]. Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3 slows or<br>
halts the generation of neurofibrillary tangles and thus treats or reduces the severity of<br>
Alzheimer"s disease.<br>
[0032] Evidence for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer"s disease has been shown in<br>
vitro. See Aplin et al (1996), J Neurochem 67:699; Sun et al (2002), Neurosci Lett<br>

-10-<br>
[0033] Evidence for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer"s disease has been shown in<br>
vivo. See Yamaguchi et al (1996), Acta Neuropathol 92:232; Pei et al (1999), J<br>
Neuropath Exp Neurol 58:1010 (GSK3b immunoreactivity is elevated in susceptible<br>
regions of AD brains); Hernandez et al (2002), J Neurochem 83:1529 (Transgenic mice<br>

al (2003) Nature 423:435 (GSK3 regulates amyloid-beta peptide production via direct<br>
inhibition of gamma secretase in AD tg mice).<br>
[0034] Presenilin-1 and kinesin-1 are also substrates for GSK-3 and relate to another<br>
mechanism for the role GSK-3 plays in Alzheimer"s disease, as was recently described by<br>
Pigino, G., et al., Journal of Neuroscience (23:4499,2003). It was found that GSK3beta<br>
phosphorylates ldnsesin-I light chain, which results in a release of kinesin-1 from<br>
membrane-bound organelles, leading to a reduction in fast anterograde axonal transport<br>
(Morfmi et al., 2002). The authors suggest that the mutations in PS1 may deregulate and<br>
increase GSK-3 activity, which in turn, impairs axonal transport in neurons. The<br>
consequent reductions in axonal transport in affected neurons ultimately lead to<br>
neurodegeneration.<br>
[0035] GSK-3 is also associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). See<br>
Williamson and Cleveland, 1999 (Axonal transport is retarded in a very early phase of<br>
ALS in mSOD1 mice); Morfini et al., 2002 (GSK3 phosphorylates kinesin light chains<br>
and inhibit anterograde axonal transport); Warita et al., Apoptosis, 6:345,2001 (The<br>
majority of spinal motor neurons lost the immunoreactivities for both PI3-K and Akt in<br>
the early and presymptomatic stage that preceded significant loss of the neurons in this<br>
SOD1 tg animal model of ALS); and Sanchez et al., 2001 (The inhibition of PI-3K<br>
induces neurite retraction mediated by GSK3 activation).<br>
[0036] GSK-3 activity is also linked to spinal cord and peripheral nerve injuries. It<br>
has been shown that GSK3 inhibition by lithium and valproic acid can induce axonal<br>
remodeling and change synaptic connectivity. See Kaytor &amp; Orr, Curr Opin Neurobiol,<br><br>
12:275,2002 (Downregulation of GSK3 causes changes in mirotubule-associated<br>
proteins: tau, MAP1 &amp; 2) and Hall et al., Mol Cell Neurosci, 20:257, 2002 (Lithium and<br>
valproic acid induces the formation of growth cone-like structures along the axons). See<br>
also Grothe et al., Brain Res, 885:172, 2000 (FGF2 stimulate Schwann cell proliferation<br>
an inhibit myelination during axonal growth); Grothe and Nikkhah, 2001 (FGF-2 is up<br>
regulated in the proximal and distal nerve stumps within 5 hours after nerve crush); and<br>
Sanchez et al., 2001 (The inhibition of PI-3K induces neurite retraction mediated by<br>
GSK3 activation).<br>
[0037] Another substrate of GSK-3 is p-catenin, which is degraded after<br>
phosphorylation by GSK-3. Reduced levels of P-catenin have been reported in<br>
schizophrenic patients and have also been associated with other diseases related to<br>
increase in neuronal cell death [Zhong et al., Nature, 395, 698-702 (1998); Takashima et<br>
al., PNAS, 90,7789-93 (1993); Pei et al., J. Neuropathol. Exp, 56,70-78 (1997); and<br>
Smith et al., Bio-org. Med. Chem. 11,635-639 (2001)]. Furthermore, ß-catenin and Tcf-4<br>
play a dual role in vascular remodeling by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell<br>
apoptosis and promoting proliferation (Wang et al., Circ Res, 90:340,2002).<br>
Accordingly, GSK-3 is associated with angiogenic disorders. See also Liu et al., FASEB<br>
J, 16:950,2002 (Activation of GSK3 reduces hepatocyte growth factor, leading to altered<br>
endothelial cell barrier function and diminished vascular integrity) and Kim et al. K J Biol<br>
Chem, 277:41888,2002 (GSK3beta activation inhibits angiogenesis in vivo using<br>
Matrigel plug assay: the inhibition of GSK3beta signaling enhances capillary formation).<br>
[0038] Association between GSK-3 and Huntington"s disease has been shown. See<br>
Carmichael et al., J Biol Chem., 277:33791,2002 (GSK3beta inhibition protect cells from<br>
poly-glutamine-induced neuronal and non-neuronal cell death via increases in b-catenin<br>
and its associated transcriptional pathway). Overexpression of GSK3 reduced the<br>
activation of heat shock transcription factor-1 and heat shock protein HSP70 (Bijur et al-,<br>
J Biol Chem, 275:7583, 2000) that are shown to decrease both poly-(Q) aggregates and<br>
cell death in in vitro HD model (Wyttenbach eta 1., Hum Mol Genet, 11:1137,2002).<br>
[0039] GSK-3 effects the levels of FGF-2 and their receptors are increased during<br>
remyelination of brain aggregate cultures remyelinating rat brains. See Copelman et al.,<br>
2000, Messersmith, et al., 2000; and Hinks and Franklin, 2000. It was also found that<br>
FGF-2 induces process outgrowth by oligodendrocytes implicating involvement of FGF<br>
in remyelination (Oh and Yong, 1996; Gogate et al., 1994) and that FGF-2 gene therapy<br>
has shown to improve the recovery of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)<br>
mice (Ruffini, et al., 2001).<br>
[0040] GSK-3 has also been associated with hair growth because Wnt/beta-catenin<br>
signaling is shown to play a major role in hair follicle morphogenesis and differentiation<br>
(Kishimotot et al. Genes Dev, 14:1181,2000; Millar, J Invest Dermatol, 118:216,2002).<br>
It was found that mice with constitutive overexpression of the inhibitors of Wnt signaling<br>
in skin failed to develop hair follicles. Wnt signals are required for the initial<br>
development of hair follicles and GSK3 constitutively regulates Wnt pathways by<br>
inhibiting beta-catenin. (Andl et al., Dev Cell 2:643,2002). A transient Wnt signal<br>
provides the crucial initial stimulus for the start of a new hair growth cycle, by activating<br>
beta-catenin and TCP-regulated gene transcription in epithelial hair follicle precursors<br>
(Van Mater et al., Genes Dev, 17:1219,2003)<br>
[0041] Because GSK-3 activity, is associated with sperm motility, GSK-3 inhibition is<br>
useful as a male contraceptive. It was shown that a decline in sperm GSK3 activity is<br>
associated with sperm motility development in bovine and monkey epididymis<br>
(Vijayaraghavan et al., Biol Reprod, 54: 709,1996; Smith et al., J Androl, 20:47,1999).<br>
Furthermore, tyrosine &amp; serine/threonine phosphorylation of GSK3 is high in motile<br>
compared to immotile sperm in bulls (Vijayaraghavan et al., Biol Reprod, 62:1647,<br>
2000). This effect was also demonstrated with human sperm (Luconi et al., Human<br>
Reprod, 16:1931,2001).<br>
[0042] The Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases plays a central role in<br>
signalling through antigen-receptors such as the TCR, BCR and Fee receptors (reviewed<br>
in Miller A, et al. Current Opinion in Immunology 14;331-340 (2002). Tec family<br>
kinases are essential for T cell activation. Three members of the Tec family, Itk, Rlk and<br>
Tec, are activated downstream of antigen receptor engagement in T cells and transmit<br>
signals to downstream effectors, including PLC-g. Combined deletion of Itk and Rlk in<br>
mice leads to a profound inhibition of TCR responses including proliferation, cytokine<br>
production and immune responses to an intracellular parasite (Toxoplasma gondii)<br>
(Schaeffer et al, Science 284; 638-641 (1999)). Intracellular signalling following TCR<br>
engagement is effected in Itk/Rlk deficient T cells; inositol triphosphate production,<br>
calcium mobilization and MAP kinase activation are all reduced.<br><br>
[0043] Tec family kinases are also essential for B cell development and activation.<br>
Patients with mutations in Btk have a profound block in B cell development, resulting in<br>
the almost complete absence of B lymphocytes and plasma cells, severely reduced Ig<br>
levels and a profound inhibition of humoral response to recall antigens (reviewed in<br>
Vihanan et al Frontiers in Bioscience 5:d917-928). Mice deficient in Btk also have a<br>
reduced number of peripheral B cells and greatly decreased levels of IgM and IgG3. Btk<br>
deletion in mice has a profound effect on B cell proliferation induced by anti-IgM, and<br>
inhibits immune responses to thymus-independent type II antigens (Ellmeier et al, J Exp<br>
Med 192:1611-1623 (2000)). Btk also plays a crucial role in mast cell activation through<br>
the high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI). Btk deficient murine mast cells have reduced<br>
degranulation and decreased production of proinfllammatory cytokines following FceRI<br>
cross-linking (Kawakami et al. Journal of leukocyte biology 65:286-290).<br>
[0044] The ribosomal protein kinases p70S6K-l and -2 are members of the AGC sub-<br>
family of protein kinases that consists of, amongst others, PKB and MSK. The p70S6<br>
kinases catalyze the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the ribosomal protein<br>
S6, which has been implicated in the translational up-regulation of mRNAs coding for the<br>
components of the protein synthetic apparatus.<br>
[0045] These mRNAs contain an oligopyrimidine tract at their 5" transcriptional start<br>
site, termed a 5TOP, which has been shown to be essential for their regulation at the<br>
translational level (Volarevic, S. et al., Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001,65,101-<br>
186). p70 S6K dependent S6 phosphorylation is stimulated in response to a variety of<br>
hormones and growth factors primarily via the PI3K pathway (Coffer, P.J. et al.,<br>
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun, 1994 198,780-786), which maybe under the regulation<br>
of mTOR, since rapamycin acts to inhibit p70S6K activity and blocks protein synthesis,<br>
specifically as a result of a down-regulation of translation of these mRNA"s encoding<br>
ribosomal proteins (Kuo, C.J. et al., Nature 1992,358,70-73).<br>
[0046] In vitro PDK1 catalyses the phosphorylation of Thr252 in the activation loop of<br>
the p70 catalytic domain, which is indispensable for p70 activity (Alessi, D.R., Curr.<br>
Biol., 1998, S, 69-81). The use of rapamycin and gene deletion studies,of dp70S6K from<br>
Drosophila and p70S6Kl from mouse have established the central role p70 plays in both<br>
cell growth and proliferation signaling.<br><br>
[0047] The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDKl) plays a key role in<br>
regulating the activity of a number of kinases belonging to the AGC subfamily of protein<br>
kinases (Alessi, D. et al., Biockem. Soc. Trans 2001,29,1). These include isoforms of<br>
protein kinase B (PKB, also known as AKT), p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) (Avruch, J.<br>
et al., Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol 2001,26,115), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (Frödin, M.<br>
et al., EMBO J. 2000,19, 2924-2934). PDK1 mediated signaling is activated in response<br>
to insulin and growth factors and as a consequence of attachment of the cell to the<br>
extracellular matrix (integrin signaling). Once activated these enzymes mediate many<br>
diverse cellular events by phosphorylating key regulatory proteins that play important<br>
roles controlling processes such as cell survival, growth, proliferation and glucose<br>
regulation [(Lawlor, M.A. et al., J. Cell Sci. 2001, 114,2903-2910), (Lawlor, M.A. et al.,<br>
EMBO J. 2002,21,3728-3738)]. PDK1 is a 556 amino acid protein, with an N-terminal<br>
catalytic domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which activates its<br>
substrates by phosphorylating these kinases at their activation loop (Belham, C. et al.,<br>
Curr. Biol. 1999,9, R93-R96). Many human cancers including prostate and NSCL have<br>
elevated PDK1 signaling pathway function resulting from a number of distinct genetic<br>
events such as PTEN mutations or over-expression of certain key regulatory proteins<br>
[(Graff, J.R., Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2002, 6,103-113), (Brognard, J., et al., Cancer<br>
Res. 2001, 61,3986-3997)]. Inhibition of.PDKl as a potential mechanism to treat cancer<br>
was demonstrated by transfection of a PTEN negative human cancer cell line (U87MG)<br>
with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PDK1. The resulting decrease in PDKl<br>
protein levels led to a reduction in cellular proliferation and survival (Flynn, P., et al.,<br>
Curr. Biol. 2000,10, 1439-1442). Consequently the design of ATP binding site inhibitors<br>
of PDKl offers, amongst other treatments, an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy.<br>
[0048] The diverse range of cancer cell genotypes has been attributed to the<br>
manifestation of the following six essential alterations in cell physiology: self-sufficiency<br>
in growth signaling, evasion of apoptosis, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory signaling,<br>
limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion leading to<br>
metastasis (Hanahan, D. et al., Cell 2000,100, 57-70). PDKl is a critical mediator of the<br>
PI3K signalling pathway, which regulates a multitude of cellular function including<br>
growth, proliferation and survival. Consequently, inhibition of this pathway could affect<br>
four or more of the six defining requirements for cancer progression. As such it is<br><br>
anticipated that a PDK1 inhibitor will have an effect on the growth of a very wide range<br>
of human cancers.<br>
[0049] Specifically, increased levels of PI3K pathway activity has been directly<br>
associated with the development of a number of human caners, progression to an<br>
aggressive refractory state (acquired resistance to chemotherapies) and poor prognosis.<br>
This increased activity has been attributed to a series of key events including decreased<br>
activity of negative pathway regulators such as the phosphatase PTEN, activating<br>
mutations of positive pathway regulators such as Ras, and overexpression of components<br>
of the pathway itself such as PKB, examples include: brain (gliomas), breast, colon, head<br>
and neck, kidney, lung, liver, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, sarcoma, thyroid<br>
[(Teng, D.H. et al, Cancer Res., 1997 57,5221-5225), (Brognard, J. et al., Cancer Res.,<br>
2001,61, 3986-3997), (Cheng, J.Q. et al., Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. 1996,93, 3636-3641),<br>
(Int. J. Cancer 1995, 64, 280), (Graff, 3.R., Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2002,6,103-113),<br>
(Am. J. Pathol. 2001,159,431)].<br>
[0050] Additionally, decreased pathway function through gene knockout, gene<br>
knockdown, dominant negative studies, and small molecule inhibitors of the pathway<br>
have been demonstrated to reverse many of the cancer phenotypes in vitro (some studies<br>
have also demonstrated a similar effect in vivo) such as block proliferation, reduce<br>
viability and sensitize cancer cells to known chemotherapies in a series of cell lines,<br>
representing the following cancers: pancreatic [(Cheng, J.Q. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
1996,93,3636-3641), (Neoplasia 2001,3,278)], lung [(Brognard, J. et al., Cancer Res.<br>
2001,61, 3986-3997), (Neoplasia 2001,3,278)], ovarian [(Hayakawa, J. et al, Cancer<br>
Res. 2000,60, 5988-5994), (Neoplasia 2001, 3, 278)], breast (Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002,1,<br>
707), colon [(Neoplasia 2001,3, 278), (Arico, S. etal., J. Biol. Chem. 2002,277,27613-<br>
27621)], cervical (Neoplasia 2001, 3,278), prostate [(Endocrinology 2001,142,4795),<br>
(Thakkar, H. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001,276,38361-38369), (Chen, X. et al., Oncogens<br>
2001,20, 6073-6083)] and brain (glioblastomas) [(Flynn, P. etal, Curr. Biol. 2000,10,<br>
1439-1442)].<br>
[0051] The Aurora family of serine/threonine kinases is essential for cell proliferation<br>
[Bischoff, J.R. &amp; Plowman, G.D. (The Aurora/Ip11p kinase family: regulators of<br>
chromosome segregation and cytokinesis) Trends in Cell Biology 9,454-459 (1999);<br>
Giet, R. and Prigent, C. (Aurora/Ip11p-related kinases, a new oncogenic family of mitotic<br><br>
serine-threonine kinases) Journal of Cell Science 112, 3591-3601 (1999); Nigg, E.A.<br>
(Mitotic kinases as regulators of cell division and its checkpoints) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell<br>
Biol. 2,21-32 (2001); Adams, R. R, Carmena, M., and Earnshaw, W.C. (Chromosomal<br>
passengers and the (aurora) ABCs of mitosis) Trends in Cell Biology 11,49-54 (2001)].<br>
Inhibitors of the Aurora kinase family therefore have the potential to block growth of all<br>
tumour types.<br>
[0052] The three known mammalian family members, Aurora-A ("1"). B ("2") and C<br>
("3"), are highly homologous proteins responsible for chromosome segregation, mitotic<br>
spindle function and cytokinesis. Aurora expression is low or undetectable in resting<br>
cells, with expression and activity peaking during the G2 and mitotic phases in cycling<br>
cells. In mammalian cells proposed substrates for Aurora include histone H3, a protein<br>
involved in chromosome condensation, and CENP-A, myosin II regulatory light chain,<br>
protein phosphatase 1, TPX2, all of which are required forcell division.<br>
[0053] Since its discovery in 1997 the mammalian Aurora kinase family has been<br>
closely linked to tumorigenesis. The most compelling evidence for this is that over-<br>
expression of Aurora-A transforms rodent fibroblasts (Bischoff, J. R., et al. A homologue<br>
of Drosophila aurora kinase is oncogenic and amplified in human colorectal cancers.<br>
EMBO J. 17, 3052-3065 (1998)). Cells with elevated levels of this kinase contain<br>
multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles, and rapidly become aneuploid. The<br>
oncogenic activity of Aurora kinases is likely to be linked to the generation of such<br>
genetic instability. Indeed, a correlation between amplification of the aurora-A locus and<br>
chromosomal instability in mammary and gastric tumours has been observed. (Miyoshi,<br>

in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast (Tanaka, T., et al. Centrosomal<br>
kinase AIK1 is overexpressed in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Cancer<br>
Research. 59,2041-2044 (1999)). High levels of Aurora-A have also been reported in<br>
renal, cervical, neuroblastoma, melanoma, lymphoma, pancreatic and prostate tumour cell<br>
lines. (Bischoff, J. R., et al. A homologue of Drosophila aurora kinase is oncogenic and<br>

STK15/BTAK/Aurora-A kinase in human pancreatic cancer Clin Cancer Res. 9(3):991-7<br>
(2003)). Amplification/overexpression of Aurora-A is observed in human bladder<br>
cancers and amplification of Aurora-A is associated with aneuploidy and aggressive<br>
clinical behaviour (Sen S. et al Amplification/overexpression of a mitotic kinase gene in<br>
human bladder cancer JNatl Cancer Inst. 94(17): 1320-9 (2002)). Moreover,<br>
amplification of the aurora-A locus (20q13) correlates with poor prognosis for patients<br>
with node-negative breast cancer (Isola, J. J., et al. Genetic aberrations detected by<br>
comparative genomic hybridization predict outcome in node-negative breast cancer.<br>
American Journal of Pathology 147,905-911 (1995)).. Aurora-B is highly expressed in<br>
multiple human tumour cell lines, including leukemic cells (Katayama et al. Human<br>
AIM-1: cDNA cloning and reduced expression during endomitosis in megakaryocyte-<br>
lineage cells. Gene 244:1-7)). Levels of this enzyme increase as a function of Duke"s<br>
stage in primary colorectal cancers (Katayama, H. et al. Mitotic kinase expression and<br>
colorectal cancer progression. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 91,1160-1162<br>
(1999)). Aurora-C, which is normally only found in germ cells, is also over-expressed in<br>
a high percentage of primary colorectal cancers and in a variety of tumour cell lines<br><br>
including cervical adenocarinoma and breast carcinoma cells (Kimura, M., Matsuda, Y.,<br>
Yoshioka, T., and Okano, Y. Cell cycle-dependent expression and centrosomal<br>
localization of a third human Aurora/Ip11-related protein kinase, AIK3. Journal of<br>
Biological Chemistry 21 A, 7334-7340 (1999). (Takahashi, T., et al. Centrosomal kinases,<br>
HsAIRk1 and HsAIRK3, are overexpressed in primary colorectal cancers. Jpn. J. Cancer<br>
Res. 91,1007-1014 (2000)).<br>
[0054] Based on the known function of the Aurora kinases, inhibition of their activity<br>
should disrupt mitosis leading to cell cycle arrest. In vivo, an Aurora inhibitor therefore<br>
slows tumor growth and induces regression.<br>
[0055] Elevated, levels of all Aurora family members are observed in a wide variety of<br>
tumour cell lines. Aurora kinases are over-expressed in many human tumors and this is<br>
reported to be associated with chromosomal instability in mammary tumors (Miyoshi et al<br>
2001 92,370-373).<br>
[0056] Aurora-2 is highly expressed in multiple human tumor cell lines and levels<br>
increase as a function of Duke"s stage in primary colorectal cancers [Katayama, H. et al.<br>
(Mitotic kinase expression and colorectal cancer progression) Journal of the National<br>
Cancer Institute 91, 1160-1162 (1999)]. Aurora-2 plays a role in controlling the accurate<br>
segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Misregulation of the cell cycle can lead to<br>
cellular proliferation and other abnormalities. In human colon cancer tissue, the Aurora-2<br>
protein is over expressed [Bischoff et al., EMBO J., 17, 3052-3065 (1998); Schumacher et<br>
al., J. Cell Biol., 143,1635-1646 (1998); Kimura et al., J. Biol. Chem., 272, 13766-13771<br>
(1997)]. Aurora-2 is over-expressed in the majority of transformed cells. Bischoff et al<br>
found high levels of Aurora-2 in 96% of cell lines derived from lung, colon, renal,<br>
melanoma and breast tumors (Bischoff et al EMBO J. 1998 17, 3052-3065). Two<br>
extensive studies show elevated Aurora-2 in 54% and 68% (Bishoff et al EMBO J. 1998<br>
17,3052-3065)(Takahashi et al 2000 Jpn J Cancer Res. 91, 1007-1014) of colorectal<br>
tumours and in 94% of invasive duct adenocarcinomas of the breast (Tanaka et al 1999<br>
59, 2041-2044).<br>
[0057] Aurora-1 expression is elevated in cell lines derived from tumors of the colon,<br>
breast, lung, melanoma, kidney, ovary, pancreas, CNS, gastric tract and leukemias<br>
(Tatsukaetal 1998 58,4811-4816).<br><br>
[0058] High levels of Aurora-3 have been detected in several tumour cell lines,<br>
although it is restricted to testis in normal tissues (Kimura et al 1999 274,7334-7340).<br>
Over-expression of Aurora-3 in a high percentage (c. 50%) of colorectal cancers has also<br>
been documented (Takahashi et al 2000 Jpn J Cancer Res. 91,1007-1014). In contrast,<br>
the Aurora family is expressed at a low level in the majority of normal tissues, the<br>
exceptions being tissues with a high proportion of dividing cells such as the thymus and<br>
testis (Bischoff et al EMBO J. 1998 17,3052-3065).<br>

[0060] The type III receptor tyrosine kinase, Flt3, plays an important role in the<br>
maintenance, growth and development of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells.<br>
[Scheijen, B, Griffin JD; Oncogene, 2002, 21, 3314-3333 and Reilly, JT, British Journal<br>
of Haematology, 2002,116,744-757]. FLT-3 regulates maintenance of stem cell/early<br>
progenitor pools as well the development of mature lymphoid and myeloid cells [Lyman,<br>
S, Jacobsen, S, Blood, 1998,91,1101-1134]. FLT-3 contains an intrinsic kinase domain<br>
that is activated upon ligand-mediated dimerization of the receptors. Upon activation, the<br>
kinase domain induces autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as the phosphorylation<br>
of various cytoplasmic proteins that help propogate the activation signal leading to<br>
growth, differentiation and survival. Some of the downstream regulators of FLT-3<br>
receptor signaling include, PLC?, PI3-kinase, Grb-2, SHIP and Src related kinases<br>
[Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,21,3314-3333]. FLT-3 kinase plays a role in a<br>
variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic malignancies. Mutations that induce<br>
ligand independent activation of FLT-3 have been implicated in acute-myelogenous<br>
leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), mastocytosis and gastrointestinal<br><br>
stromal tumor (GIST). These mutations include single amino acid changes in the kinase<br>
domain or internal tandem duplications, point mutations or in-frame deletions of the<br>
juxtamernbrane region of the receptors. In addition to activating mutations, Iigand<br>
dependent (autocrine or paracrine) stimulation of over-expressed wild-type FLT-3<br>
contributes to the malignant phenotype [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,21,<br>
3314-3333]. See also Sawyer, C.l. (Finding the next Gleevec: FLT3 targeted kinase<br>
inhibitor therapy for acute myeloid leukaemia) Cancer Cell.l, 413-415 (2002).<br>
[0061] Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases<br>
consisting of a b-sheet rich amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxy-terminal lobe that is<br>
largely a-helical. The CDKs display the 11 subdomains shared by all protein kinases and<br>
range in molecular mass from 33 to 44 kD. This family of kinases, which includes<br>
CDK1, CKD2, CDK4, and CDK6, requires phosphorylation at the residue corresponding<br>
to CDK2 Thrl60 in order to be fully active [Meijer, L., Drug Resistance Updates 2000,3,<br>
83-88].<br>
[0062] Each CDK complex is formed from a regulatory cyclin subunit (e.g., cyclin A,<br>
B1, B2, D1, D2, D3, and E) and a catalytic kinase subunit (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK4,<br>
CDK5, and CDK6). Each different kinase/cyclin pair functions to regulate the different<br>
and specific phases of the cell cycle known as the G1, S, G2, and M phases [Nigg, E.,<br>
Nature Reviews 2001,2,21-32; Flatt, P., Pietenpol, J., Drug Metabolism Reviews 2000,<br>
32,283-305].<br>
[0063] The CDKs have been implicated in cell proliferation disorders, particularly in<br>
cancer. Cell proliferation is a result of the direct or indirect deregulation of the cell<br>
division cycle and the CDKs play a critical role in the regulation of the various phases of<br>
this cycle. For example, the over-expression of cyclin Dl is commonly associated with<br>
numerous human cancers including breast, colon, hepatocellular carcinomas and gliomas<br>
[Flatt, P., Pietenpol, J., Drug Metabolism Reviews 2000,32,283-305]. The CDK2/cyclin<br>
E complex plays a key role in the progression from the early Gl to S phases of the cell<br>
cycle and the overexpression of cyclin E has been associated with various solid tumors.<br>
Therefore, inhibitors of cyclins Dl, E, or their associated CDKs are useful targets for<br>
cancer therapy [Kaubisch, A., Schwartz, G., The Cancer Journal 2000,6, 192-212].<br>
[0064] CDKs, especially CDK2, also play a role in apoptosis and T-cell development.<br>
CDK2 has been identified as a key regulator of thymocyte apoptosis [Williams, O., et al,<br><br>
European Journal of Immunology 2000,709-713]. Stimulation of CDK2 kinase activity<br>
is associated with the progression of apoptosis in thymocytes, in response to specific<br>
stimuli. Inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity blocks this apoptosis resulting in the<br>
protection of thymocytes.<br>
[0065] In addition to regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, the CDKs are directly<br>
involved in the process of transcription. Numerous viruses require CDKs for their<br>
replication process. Examples where CDK inhibitors restrain viral replication include<br>
human cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, and varicella-zoster virus [Meijer, L., Drug<br>
Resistance Updates 2000,3, 83-88].<br>
[0066] Inhibition of CDK is also useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative<br>
disorders such as Alzheimer"s disease. The appearance of Faired Helical Filaments<br>
(PHF), associated with Alzheimer"s disease, is caused by the hyperphosphorylation of Tau<br>
protein by CDK5/p25 [Meijer, L., Drug Resistance Updates, 2000 3, 83-88].<br>
[0067] PIM-1 is the protooncogene activated by murine leukemia virus (Provirus<br>
Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus) [Cuypers, H.T. et al. Cell 1984,37,<br>
141—150]. The expression of the protoconcogene produces a non-transmembrane<br>
serine/threonine kinase of 313 residues, including a kinase domain consisting of 253<br>
amino acid residues. Two isofonns are known through alternative initiation (p44 and<br>
p33) [Saris, C.J.M. ettd., EMBO J. 1991,10, 655-664]. Two PIM-1 homologs have been<br>
described [Baytel, D. Biochim Biophys Acta 1998,1442, 274-85; Feldman, J. etal.J<br>
Biol Chem 1998,273,16535-16543]. PIM-2 and PIM-3 are respectively 58% and 69%<br>
identical to Pim-1 at the amino acid level. PIM-1 is highly expressed in the liver and<br>
spleen during hematopoiesis, and expression is induced by cytokines such as GM-CSF,<br>
G-SCF, IL-3, IF-a, and IL-6 [Lilly, M. et al., Oncogene 1992, 7,727-732; Sato, N. et al,<br>
EMBO J. 1993,12,4181-4189; Jaster, R. et al., Cell Signal 1999,11, 331-335;<br>
Matikainen, S. et al, Blood 1999,93,1980-1991].<br>
[0068] PIM-1 has been implicated in lymphoma development. Induced expression of<br>
PIM-1 and the protooncogene c-myc synergize to increase the incidence of<br>
lymphomagenesis [Breuer, M. et al., Nature 1989, 340,61-63; van Lohuizen, M. et al.,<br>
Cell 1991, 65,737-52]. PIM-1 functions in cytokine signaling pathways and has been<br>
shown to play a role in T-cell development [Schmidt, T. et al, EMBO J. 17,1998,5349-<br>
5359; Jacobs, H. et al., JEM 1999,190,1059-1068]. Signaling through gpl30, a subunit<br><br>
common to receptors of the IL-6 cytokine family, activates the transcription factor<br>
STAT3 and can lead to the proliferation of hematopoietic cells [Hirano, T. et al,<br>
Oncogene 2000,19,2548-2556]. A kinase-active P1M-1 appears to be essential for the<br>
gpl30-mediated STAT3 proliferation signal. In cooperation with the c-myc, PIM-1 can<br>
proteste STAT3-mediated cell cycle progression and antiapoptosis [Shirogane, T. et al,<br>
Immunity 1999,11,709-719]. PIM-1 also appears to be necessary for IL-3-stimulated<br>
growth in bone marrow- derived mast cells [Domen, J. et al, Blood 1993,82,1445-52]<br>
and survival of FDCP1 cells after IL-3 withdrawal [Lilly, M. et al, Oncogene 1999,18,<br>
4022-4031].<br>
[0069] Additionally, control of cell proliferation and survival by PIM-1 may be<br>
effected by means of its phosphorylation of the well established cell cycle regulators<br>
cdc25 [Mochizuki, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999,274,18659-18666] and/or<br>
p21(Cip1/WAF1)[ Wang, Z. et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2002,1593,45-55] or<br>
phosphorylation of heterochromatin protein 1, a molecule involved in chromatin structure<br>
and transcriptional regulation [Koike, N. et al, FEBS Lett. 2000,467,17-21].<br>
[0070] A family of type m receptor tyrosine kinases including Flt3, c-Kit, PDGF-<br>
receptor and c-Fms play an important role in the maintenance, growth and development<br>
of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,<br>
21, 3314-3333 and Reilly, JT, British Journal of Haematology, 2002,116,744-757].<br>
FLT-3 and c-Kit regulate maintenance of stem cell/early progenitor pools as well the<br>
development of mature lymphoid and myeloid cells [Lyman, S, Jacobsen, S, Blood, 1998,<br>
91, 1101-1134]. Both receptors contain an intrinsic kinase domain that is activated upon<br>
ligand-mediated dimerization of the receptors. Upon activation, the kinase domain<br>
induces autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as the phosphorylation of various<br>
cytoplasmic proteins that help propogate the activation signal leading to growth,<br>
differentiation and survival. Some of the downstream regulators of FLT-3 and c-Kit<br>
receptor signaling include, PLC?, PI3-kinase, Grb-2, SHIP and Src related kinases<br>
[Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,21, 3314-3333]. Both receptor tyrosine<br>
kinases have been shown to play a role in a variety of hematopoietic and non-<br>
hematopoietic malignancies. Mutations that induce ligand independent activation of<br>
FLT-3 and c-Kit have been implicated acute-myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute<br>
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).<br><br>
These mutations include single amino acid changes in the kinase domain or internal<br>
tandem duplications, point mutations or in-frame deletions of the juxtamembrane region<br>
of the receptors. In addition to activating mutations, ligand dependent (autocrine or<br>
paracrine) stimulation of over-expressed wild-type FLT-3 or c-Kit can contribute to the<br>
mangnant phenotype [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,21,3314-3333].<br>
[0071] c-fms encodes for macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSF-1R)<br>
which is expressed predominately in the monocytes/macrophage lineage [Dai, XM et al.,<br>
Blood, 2002,99,111-120]. MCSF-1R and its ligand regulate macrophage lineage growth<br>
and differentiation. like the other family members, MCSF-1R contains an intrinsic<br>
kinase domain that is activated upon ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor. MCSF-<br>
1R is is also expressed in non- hematopoietic cells including mammary gland epithelial<br>
cells and neurons. Mutations in this receptor are potentially linked to myeloid leukemias<br>
and its expression is correlated with metastatic breast, ovarian and endometrial<br>
carcinomas [Reilly, JT, British Journal of Haematology, 2002,116,744-757 and<br>
Kacinski, BM, Mol. Reprod and Devel., 1997, 46,71-74]. Another possible indication<br>
for antagonists of MCSF-1R is osteoporosis [Teitelbaum, S, Science 2000, 289,1504-<br>
1508.<br>
[0072] PDGF-receptor (PDGFR) has two subunits- PDGFR-a and PDGRR-ß, which<br>
can form homo or heterodimers upon ligand binding. There are several PDGF ligands:<br>
AB, BB, CC and DD. PDGFR is expressed on early stem cells, mast cells, myeloid cells,<br>
mesenchymal cells and smooth muscle cells [Scheijen, B, Griffin JD, Oncogene, 2002,<br>
21,3314-3333]. Only PDGFR-ß has been implicated in myeloid leukemias- usually as a<br>
translocation partner with Tel, Huntingtin interacting protein (HIP1) or Rabaptin5.<br>
Recently it was shown that activation mutations in PDGFR-a kinase domain are in<br>
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) [Heinrich, MC et al., Sciencexpress, 2003]<br>
[0073] Another kinase family of particular interest is the Src family of kinases. These<br>
kinases are implicated in cancer, immune system dysfunction and bone remodeling<br>
diseases. For general reviews, see Thomas and Brugge, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997,<br>
13, 513; Lawrence and Niu, Pharmacol. Ther. 1998, 77, 81; Tatosyan and Mizenina,<br>
Biochemistry (Moscow) 2000, 65, 49-58; Boschelli et al., Drugs of the Future 2000,<br>
25(7), 717.<br><br>
[0074] Members of the Src family include the following eight kinases in mammals:<br>
Src, Fyn, Yes, Fgr, Lyn, Hck, Lck, and Blk. These are nonreceptor protein kinases that<br>
range in molecular mass from 52 to 62 kD. All are characterized by a common structural<br>
organization that is comprised of six distinct functional domains: Src homology domain 4<br>
(SH4), a unique domain, SH3 domain, SH2 domain, a catalytic domain (SHI), and a C-<br>
tenninal regulatory region. Tatosyan et al. Biochemistry (Moscow) 2000,65,49-58.<br>
[0075] Based on published studies, Src kinases are considered as potential therapeutic<br>
targets for various human diseases. Mice that are deficient in Src develop osteopetrosis,<br>
or bone build-up, because of depressed bone resorption by osteoclasts. This shows that<br>
osteoporosis resulting from abnormally high bone resorption is treated by inhibiting Src.<br>
Soriano et al., Cell 1992,69, 551 and Soriano et al., Cell 1991, 64,693.<br>
[0076] Suppression of arthritic bone destruction has been achieved by the<br>
overexpression of CSK in rheumatoid synoviocytes and osteoclasts. Takayanagi et al., J..<br>
Clin. Invest. 1999,104,137. CSK, or C-terminal Src kinase, phosphorylates and thereby<br>
inhibits Src catalytic activity. This implies that Src inhibition may prevent joint<br>
destruction that is characteristic in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Boschelli<br>
et al., Drugs of the Future 2000,25(7), 717.<br>
[0077] Src also plays a role in the replication of hepatitis B virus. The virally encoded<br>
transcription factor HBx activates Src in a step required for propagation of the virus.<br>
Klein et al, EMBO J. 1999, IS, 5019, and Klein et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997,17,6427.<br>
[0078] A number of studies have linked Src expression to cancers such as colon,<br>
breast, hepatic and pancreatic cancer, certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.<br>
Talamonti et al., J. Clin. Invest. 1993, 91, 53; Lutz et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. 1998<br>
243, 503; Rosen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1986, 267,13754; Bolen et al., Proc. Natl Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 1987, 84,2251; Masaki et al, Hepatology 1998, 27,1257; Biscardi et al, Adv.<br>
Cancer Res. 1999, 76,61; Lynch et al, Leukemia 1993, 7,1416. Furthermore, antisense<br>
Src expressed, in ovarian and colon tumor cells has been shown to inhibit tumor growth.<br>
Wiener et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 1999, 5, 2164; Staley et al., Cell Growth Diff. 1997,8,<br>
269.<br>
[0079] Other Src family kinases are also potential therapeutic targets. Lck plays a role<br>
in T-cell signaling. Mice that lack the Lck gene have a poor ability to develop<br>
thyrnocytes. The function of Lck as a positive activator of T-cell signaling suggests that<br><br>
Lck inhibitors may be useful for treating autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. Molina et al., Nature, 1992,357,161. Hck, Fgr and Lyn have been identified as<br>
important mediators of integrin signaling in myeloid leukocytes. Lowell et al, J. Leukoc.<br>
Biol., 1999,65, 313. Inhibition of these kinase mediators may therefore be useful for<br>
treating inflammation. Boschelli et al., Drugs of the Future 2000,25(7), 717.<br>
[0080] Syk is a tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in FceRI mediated mast cell<br>
degranulation and eosinophil activation. Accordingly, Syk kinase is implicated in various<br>
allergic disorders, in particular asthma. It has been shown that Syk binds to the<br>
phosphorylated gamma chain of the FceRI receptor via N-terminal SH2 domains and is<br>
essential for downstream signaling [Taylor et al, Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995,15,4149].<br>
[0081] Inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis has been proposed as a key mechanism for<br>
the development of blood and tissue eosinophilia in asthma. IL-5 and GM-CSF are<br>
upregulated in asthma and are proposed to cause blood and tissue eosinophilia by<br>
inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis. Inhibition of eosinophil apoptosis has been proposed<br>
as a key mechanism for the development of blood and tissue eosinophilia in asthma. It<br>
has been reported that Syk kinase is requircd foxthe prevention of eosinophil apoptosis by<br>
cytokines (using antisense)[Yousefi et al., J. Exp. Med. 1996,183,1407].<br>
[0082] The role of Syk in FcyR dependent and independent response in bone marrow<br>
derived macrophages has been determined by using irradiated mouse chimeras<br>
reconstituted with fetal liver cells from Syk -/- embryos. Syk deficient macrophages were<br>
defective in phagocytosis induced by Fc?R but showed normal phagocytosis in response<br>
to complement [Kiefer et al, Mol Cell. Biol. 1998,18,4209]. It has also been reported<br>
that aerosolized Syk antisense suppresses Syk expression and mediator release from<br>
macrophages [Stenton et al, J. Immunology 2000,164,3790].<br>
[0083] Another kinase family of interest is Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein<br>
serine/threonine kinase (ROCK), which is believed to be an effector of Ras-related small<br>
GTPase Rho. The ROCK family includes p160ROCK (ROCK-1) (Ishizaki et al, EMBO<br>
J. 1996,15,1885-1893) and ROKa/Rho-kinase/ROCK-II (Leung et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
1995,270,29051-29054; Matsui et al, EMBO J. 1996,15,2208-2216; Nakagawa et al,<br>
FEBS Lett. 1996, 392, 189-193), protein kinase PKN (Amano et al, Science 1996,271,<br>

(Madaule et al., Nature 1998,394,491-494; Madaule et al., FEBS Lett. 1995,377,243-<br>
248). The ROCK family of kinases have been shown to be involved in a variety of<br>
functions including Rho-induced formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions<br>
(Leung et al., Mot. Cell Biol. 1996,16,5313-5327; Amano et al., Science 1997,275,<br>
1308-1311; Ishizaki etal., FEBS Lett. 1997,404,118-124) and in downregulation of<br>
mynsin phosphatase (Kimura et al., Science 1996,273,245-248), platelet activation<br>
(Klages et al, J. Cell Biol. 1999,144,745-754), aortic smooth muscle contraction by<br>
various stimuli (Fu et al., FEBS Lett. 1998,440,183-187), thrombin-induced responses of<br>
aortic smooth muscle cells (Seasholtz et al., dr. Res. 1999,84,1186-1193), hypertrophy<br>
of cardiomyocytes (Kuwahara et al, FEBS Lett., 1999,452,314-318), bronchial smooth<br>
muscle contraction (Yoshii et al.. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999,20,1190-1200),<br>
smooth muscle contraction and cytoskeletal reorganization of non-muscle cells (Fukata et<br>
al. Trends in Pharm. Sci. 2001, 22, 32-39), activation of volume-regulated anion<br>
channels (Nilius et al, J. Physiol. 1999,516,67-74), neurite retraction (Hirose et al., J.<br>
Cell Biol. 1998,141, 1625-1636), neutrophil chemotaxis (Niggli, FEBS Lett. 1999,445,<br>
69-72), wound healing (Nobes and Hall, J. Cell Biol 1999,144,1235-1244), tumor<br>
invasion (Itoh et al., Nat. Med. 1999,5,221-225) and cell transformation (Sahai et al.,<br>
Curr. Biol. 1999,9, 136-145). Accordingly, the development of inhibitors of ROCK<br>
kinase would be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of disorders mediated by<br>
the ROCK kinase pathway.<br>
[0084] ZAP-70 is essential for T-cell receptor signalling. Expression of this tyrosine<br>
kinase is restricted to T-cells and natural killer cells. The importance of ZAP-70 in T-cell<br>
function has been demonstrated in human patients, human T-cell lines and mice. Human<br>
patients suffering from a rare form of severe combined deficiency syndrome (SCID)<br>
possess homozygous mutations in ZAP-70 (reviewed in Elder J. of Pedriatric<br>
Hematology/Oncology 1997, iP(6), 546-550). These patients have profound<br>
immunodeficiency, lack CD8+ T-cells and have CD4+ T-cells that are unresponsive to T-<br>
cell receptor (TCR)-mediated stimulation. Following TCR activation these CD4+ cells<br>
show severe defects in Ca2+ mobilization, tyrosine phosphorylation of down-stream<br>
substrates, proliferation and IL-2 production 70 (reviewed in Elder Pedriatric Research<br>
39,743-748). Human Jurkat cells lacking ZAP-70 also provide important insights into<br>
the critical role of ZAP-70 in T-cell receptor signalling. A Jurkat clone (p116) with no<br>
detectable ZAP-70 protein was shown to have defects in T-cell receptor signalling which<br><br>
could be corrected by re-introduction of wild type ZAP-70 (Williams et al., Molecular<br>
and Cellular Biology 1998,18 (3), 1388-1399). Studies of mice lacking ZAP-70 also<br>
demonstrate a requirement of ZAP-70 in T-cell receptor signalling. ZAP-70-deficient<br>
mice have profound defects in T-cell development and T-cell receptor signalling in<br>
thynrocytes is impaired (Negishi et al., Nature 1995 376,435-438).<br>
[0085] The importance of the kinase domain in ZAP-70 function is demonstrated by<br>
studies of human patients and mice expressing identical mutations in the DLAARN motif<br>
within the kinase domain of ZAP-70. Inactivation of kinase activity by this mutation<br>
results in defective T-cell receptor signalling (Elder et al., J. Immunology 2001, 656-661).<br>
Catalytically inactive ZAP-70 (Lys369Arg) was also defective in restoring T-cell receptor<br>
signalling in a ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat cell clone (pi 16) (Williams et al., Molecular and<br>
Cellular Biology 1998,18 (3), 1388-1399).<br>
[0086] The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine kinases consisting of JAK1,<br>
JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a critical role in cytokine signaling. The down-<br>
stream substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal transducer and activator<br>
of transcription (STAT) proteins. JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the<br>
mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune<br>
diseases such as transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis<br>
and multiple sclerosis as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias<br>
and lymphomas. The pharmaceutical intervention in the JAK/STAT pathway has been<br>
reviewed [Frank Mol. Med. 5:432-456 (1999) &amp; Seidel, et al, Oncogene 19: 2645-2656<br>
(2000)].<br>
[0087] JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, while JAK3 is<br>
predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. JAK3 binds exclusively to the common<br>
cytokine receptor gamma chain (?c) and is activated by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, EL-9, and IL-15.<br>
The proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have, in<br>
fact, been shown to be dependent on JAK3- and ?c- signaling [Suzuki et al, Blood 96:<br>
2172-2180(2000)].<br>
[0088] Cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig) E receptors of<br>
sensitized mast cells leads to a release of proinflammatory mediators, including a number<br>
of vasoactive cytokines resulting in acute allergic, or immediate (type I) hypersensitivity<br>
reactions [Gordon et al, Nature 346: 274-276 (1990) &amp; Galli, N. Engl. J. Med., 328:257-<br>
-28-<br>
265 (1993)]. A crucial role for JAK3 in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell responses in<br>
vitro and in vivo has been established [Malaviya, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.<br>
257: 807-813 (1999)]. In addition, the prevention of type I hypersensitivity reactions,<br>
including anaphylaxis, mediated by mast cell-activation through inhibition of JAK3 has<br>
also ocen reported [Malaviya et al, J. Biol. Chem. 274:27028-27038 (1999)]. Targeting<br>
mast cells with JAK3 inhibitors modulated mast cell degranulation in vitro and prevented<br>
IgE receptor/antigen-mediated anaphylactic reactions in vivo.<br>
[0089] A recent study described the successful targeting of JAK3 for immune<br>
suppression and allograft acceptance. The study demonstrated a dose-dependent survival<br>
of Buffalo heart allograft in Wistar Furth recipients upon administration of inhibitors of<br>
JAK3 indicating the possibility of regulating unwanted immune responses in graft versus<br>
host disease [Kirken, transpl. proc. 33:3268-3270 (2001)].<br>
[0090] IL-4-mediated STAT-phosphorylation has been implicated as the mechanism<br>
involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Up-regulation of<br>
proinflammatory cytokines in RA synovium and synovial fluid is a characteristic of the<br>
disease. It has been demostrated that IL-4-mediated activation of IL-4/STAT pathway is<br>
mediated through the Janus Kinases (JAK 1 &amp; 3) and that IL-4-associated JAK kinases<br>
are expressed in the RA synovium [Muller-Ladner, et al, J. Immunol. 164: 3894-3901<br>
(2000)].<br>
[0091] Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative<br>
disorder affecting about 10% of ALS patients. The survival rates of FALS mice were<br>
increased upon treatment with a JAK3 specific inhibitor. This confirmed that JAK3 plays<br>
a role in FALS [Trieu, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 267: 22-25 (2000)].<br>
[0092] Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are activated<br>
by, among others, the JAK family kinases. Results form a recent study suggested the<br>
possibility of intervention in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by targeting JAK family<br>
kinases with specific inhibitors for the treatment of leukemia [Sudbeck, et al, Clin. Cancer<br>
Res. 5:1569-1582 (1999)]. JAK3 specific compounds were shown to inhibit the<br>
clonogenic growth of JAK3-expressing cell lines DAUDI, RAMOS, LCI; 19, NALM-6,<br>
MOLT-3 and HL-60.<br>
[0093] In animal models, TEL/JAK2 fusion proteins have induced myeloproliferative<br>
disorders and in hematopoietic cell lines, introduction of TEL/JAK2 resulted in activation<br><br>
of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and cytokine-independent growth [Schwaller, et al, EMBO J.<br>
17: 5321-5333 (1998)].<br>
[0094] Inhibition of JAK 3 and TYK 2 abrogated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3,<br>
and inhibited cell growth of mycosis fungoides, a form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma.<br>
These results implicated JAK family kinases in the constitutively activated JAK/STAT<br>
pathway that is present in mycosis fungoides [Nielsen, et al, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.<br>
94: 6764-6769 (1997)]. Similarly, STAT3, STAT5, JAK1 and JAK2 were demonstrated<br>
to be constitutively activated in mouse T cell lymphoma characterized initially by LCK<br>
over-expression, thus further implicating the JAK/STAT pathway in abnormal cell<br>
growth [Yu, et al, J. Immunol. 159:5206-5210 (1997)]. In addition, IL-6 -mediated<br>
STAT3 activation was blocked by an inhibitor of JAK, leading to sensitization of<br>
myeloma cells to apoptosis [Catlett-Falcone, et al, Immunity 10:105-115 (1999)].<br>
[0095] As a result of the biological importance of protein kinases, there is current<br>
interest in therapeutically effective protein kinase inhibitors. Accordingly, there is still a<br>
great need to develop inhibitors of protein kinases that are useful in treating various<br>
diseases or conditions associated with protein kinase activation.<br>

[00100] As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise<br>
indicated. The phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the phrase<br>
"substituted or unsubstituted." Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted<br>
group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and each<br>

unsaturation, but which is not aromatic (also referred to herein as "carbocycle" or<br>
"cycloalkyl"), that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule wherein<br>
any individual ring in said bicyclic ring system has 3-7 members. For example, suitable<br>

such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Vascular stents,<br>
for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessel wall after<br>
injury). However, patients using stents or other implantable devices risk clot formation or<br>
platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be prevented or mitigated by pre-coating<br><br>
the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a kinase inhibitor.<br>
Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described<br>
in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically<br>
biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
peycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of<br>
fiuorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations<br>
thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. Implantable<br>
devices coated with a compound of this invention are another embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>

The disappearance of NADH can be conveniently followed at 340 run.<br>
[00415] The following were the final concentrations of the assay components: 0.025<br>
M HEPES, pH 7.6,10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 5 mg/ml poly Glu-Tyr, and 50 nM of<br>
recombinant human Lck kinase. Final concentrations of the components of the coupled<br>
enzyme system were 2.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 200 µM. NADH, 30 µg/ml pyruvate<br>
kinase and 10 µg/ml lactate dehydrogenase.<br>
[00416] In a typical assay, all the reaction components with the exception of ATP<br>
were pre-mixed and aliquoted into assay plate wells. Inhibitors dissolved in DMSO were<br>
added to the wells to give a final DMSO concentration of 2.5%. The assay plate was<br>
incubated at 30 °C for 10 minutes before initiating the reaction with 150 µM ATP. The<br>
absorbance change at 340 nm with time, the rate of the reaction, was monitored on a<br>
molecular devices plate reader. The data of rate as a function of the inhibitor<br>
concentration was fitted to competitive inhibition kinetics model to get the Ki for the<br>
compound.<br>
[00417] Compounds of the present invention were found to be inhibitors of LCK.<br>
