[Title of the Invention] VEHICULAR LIGHTING DEVICE<br>
STRUCTURE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicular lighting device structure suitable, for example, for a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
A vehicular lighting device structure has been in use in which bulb light can be distributed in a direction different from the direction of reflection by a main reflector (see the patent document 1, for example). [Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2007-83894 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
According to the existing technique applied to the above vehicular lighting device structure, bulb light is distributed merely through a gap or an opening provided around or in a main reflector, so that the distributed bulb light easily diffuses malcing it difficult to secure adequate brightness.<br>
Hence, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicular lighting device structure in which bulb light can be distributed also in a direction different from the direction of reflection by a main reflector accurately while securing adequate brightness of the distributed bulb<br><br>
light.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[0004]<br>
To achieve the above object, the invention according to claim 1 provides a vehicular lighting device (e.g. the front winker 52 of the following embodiment) structure being provided with a bulb (e.g. the bulb 66 of the following embodiment) and a main reflector (e.g. the main reflector 67 of the following embodiment) both disposed in a lamp body (e.g. the lamp body 63 of the following embodiment) which includes a housing (e.g. the housing 64 of the following embodiment) and a lens (e.g. the lens 65 of the following embodiment) and being capable of distributing bulb light from the bulb in a direction different from a direction of reflection by the main reflector. In the vehicular lighting device structure, the main reflector has a slit (e.g. the slit 81 of the following embodiment) through which the bulb light is led to behind the main reflector, and a sub-reflector (e.g. the sub-reflector 82 of the following embodiment) is provided behind the main reflector, the sub-reflector extending along a direction in which the bulb light led through the slit advances. Also in the vehicular lighting device structure, the bulb light led to behind the main reflector through the slit is distributed by the sub-reflector in a direction different from the direction of reflection by the main reflector. [0005]<br><br>
The'invention according to claim 2 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein the sub-reflector has a stepped reflection surface (e.g. the reflection surfaces 82a and 82b of the following embodiment). [0006]<br>
The invention according to claim 3 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein the lens has, at least on an inside surface portion thereof facing the sub-reflector, a lens-cut portion to reflect part of the bulb light toward the sub-reflector. [0007]<br>
The invention according to claim 4 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein the sub-reflector and the marn reflector are integrally formed. [0008]<br>
The invention according to claim 5 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein widths (e.g. widths h1 and h2 of the following embodiment) of the slit and sub-reflector are approximately the same. [0009]<br>
The invention according to claim 6 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein the lighting device is for installation on each of left and right sides of a front cover (e.g. the front cover 51 of the following embodiment) of a vehicle (e.g. the motorcycle 1 of the following embodiment) such that, on each of the left and right sides, the sub-reflector is disposed, behind the main<br><br>
reflector' and near a lateral edge (e.g. the laterally outer edge 51c of the following embodiment) of the front cover, to extend upwardly and rearwardly along the lateral edge. [0010]<br>
The invention according to claim 7 provides the vehicular lighting device structure, wherein, on each of the left and right sides, the lighting device is disposed upwardly continuously from a headlamp (e.g. the headlamp 61 of the following embodiment) laterally inwardly disposed on the front cover. [Effect of the Invention] [0011]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 1, when bulb light is also distributed in a direction different from the direction of reflection by the main reflector, the bulb light led to behind the main reflector is distributed in a desired direction by the sub-reflector, so that, compared with cases in which bulb light is merely leaked in the different direction, diffusion of the bulb light is reduced making it possible to accurately distribute the bulb light in the different direction while ensuring adequate brightness of the bulb light. This adds to the functions of the lighting device and enhances its merchantability.<br>
The sub-reflector extends along the direction in which the bulb light led through the slit advances, allowing the lens to have a slender light emitting portion. This improves the vehicle appearance by causing the vehicle<br><br>
to look sharp and novel. [0012]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 2, the bulb light led through the slit can be evenly and efficiently distributed along the direction in which the sub-reflector extends. [0013]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 3, the bulb light directly reaching the lens through the slit can be reflected toward the sub-reflector, so that the bulb light led through the slit can be securely distributed without being wasted. [0014]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 4, the number of parts to be assembled can be reduced to facilitate assembly work and to reduce the cost and weight of the device. [0015]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 5, a slender and sharp light emitting portion can be formed efficiently. [0016]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 6, the light emitting portion of the sub-reflector is disposed near the laterally outer edge on each of the left and right sides of the front cover of the vehicle and extends upwardly and rearwardly. This enlarges the vertical dimension of the area illuminated by the light emitting<br><br>
portion and improves the visibility of the lighting device. In addition, the distance between the lighting devices disposed on the left and right sides can be increased to make the vehicle look laterally wider and thereby improve the visibility of the vehicle. [0017]<br>
According to the invention according to claim 7, on each of the left and right sides of the front cover, the light emitting portions of the head lamp and the lighting device can be made to extend from a laterally inner portion to a laterally outer portion close to the laterally outer edge of the front cover of the vehicle. This makes it easier for people to grasp information on the condition of the vehicle, for example, assessing the speed of or the distance from the vehicle. Furthermore, the lighting device can be disposed integrally with and upwardly of the head lamp to improve the appearance of the vehicle. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0018]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to drawings. In the following description, the directions front, rear, left, and right are as seen from the vehicle unless otherwise specified. In the drawings referred to in the following, arrows FR, LH, and UP represent forward, leftward, and upward directions, respectively, based on the vehicle. [0019]<br>
In a scooter-type motorcycle (saddle-ride type<br><br>
vehicle)  shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a head pipe 3 disposed at a front end portion of a body frame 2 steerably and rotatably supports, via a steering system 5a, left and right front forks 5 to which a front wheel 4 is journaled. A steering handlebar 6 is attached to an upper portion of the steering stem 5a. In Fig. 2, line CS represents a lateral center plane of the vehicle. [0020]<br>
The body frame 2 is of an undertone type including a main frame 7 which extends downwardly and rearwardly from the head pipe 3, thereby forming a low portion between the head pipe 3 and an occupant seat 13 to allow the occupant to straddle over the seat 13 with ease. The low portion is provided with a floor step 54 on which the occupant (rider) can rest his or her feet. [0021]<br>
A rear end portion of the main frame 7 is, at a longitudinally intermediate lower portion of the vehicle body, joined to a laterally intermediate portion of a cross frame 8 extending leftwardly and rightwardly. Left and right pivot plates 9 which vertically swingably support, via a suspension link 41, a front portion of a swing unit 30 are joined to left and right end portions of the cross frame 8, respectively. [0022]<br>
Front end portions of left and right rear frames 11 are also joined to left and right end portions of the cross frame 8. The left and right rear frames 11 extend upwardly<br><br>
and rearwardly from where they are joined to the cross frame 8. The seat 13 having a front seating area for the rider and a rear seating area for a pillion passenger is disposed above the left and right rear frames 11. [0023]<br>
The swing unit 30 integrally includes an engine 31 disposed in a front portion thereof and a power transmission mechanism 35 disposed in a rear left portion thereof. The front portion of the swing unit 30 is vertically swingably supported by the left and right pivot plates 9 via the suspension link 41. The rear left portion of the swing unit 30 is supported by the left rear frame 11 via a rear cushion 42 swingably relative to the left rear frame 11. A rear end portion of the power transmission mechanism 35 rotatably supports a rear wheel 38. [0024]<br>
The body frame 2 is covered by a body cover 50 mainly made of a synthetic resin.<br>
The body cover 50 includes, as its main parts, a front cover 51 covering a front portion (including the head pipe 3 and a portion around an upper portion of the main frame 7) of the body frame 2 from the front side, an inner cover 52 covering the front portion of the body frame 2 from behind, an under cover 53 covering, to be continuous from a lower portion of the front cover 51, a lower portion (including a portion around a lower portion of the main frame 7) of the body frame 2 from below, the floor step 54 covering the lower portion of the body frame 2 from above,<br><br>
a rear center cover 55 covering a front portion of a rear portion (including a portion around a front portion of each of the left and right rear frames 11) of the body frame 2 from the front side, and left and right rear side covers 56 covering, from sides, a rear portion (including a portion around each of the left and right rear frames 11) of the body frame 2. [0025]<br>
The front cover 51 is disposed upwardly of a front wheel 4. A front fender 58 covering the front wheel 4 from above is disposed between the front cover 51 and the front wheel 4. The handlebar 6 and a portion around it are covered by a handlebar cover 57.<br>
The body cover 50 including the front cover 51 and other covers is fixedly attached to the body frame 2. The handlebar cover 57 and the front fender 58 are attached, together with the front wheel 4 and the handlebar 6, to the head pipe 3 rotatably around the head pipe 3. [0026]<br>
The front cover 51 integrally includes an inclined front wall portion 51a extending forwardly and downwardly, and left and right side wall portions 51b extending downwardly and rearwardly from lower portions on both sides, respectively, of the inclined front wall portion 51a.<br>
The inclined front wall portion 51a of the front cover 51 is attached with left and right headlamps 61 and left and right front winkers 62. [0027]<br><br>
The' left and right headlamps 61 are laterally inwardly disposed on lower left and right sides of the inclined front wall portion 51a, respectively. They have left and right lens surfaces 61a which are shaped vertically long somewhat tapering upwardly and which are arranged in a V-shape as viewed from the front. In the attached drawings, reference codes 61b and 61c represent bulbs, i.e. light sources of the headlamps 61, and reflectors, respectively. The reflectors 61c reflect the light from the bulbs 61b forwardly of the vehicle.<br>
The left and right front winkers 62 are laterally outwardly disposed on upper left and right sides of the inclined front wall portion 51a, respectively. They have slender lens surfaces 62a somewhat tapering upwardly and arranged to be upwardly continuous with the left and right lens surfaces 61a of the left and right headlamps 61. [0028]<br>
The inclined front wall portion 51a is entirely curved such that its portions closer to its laterally outer edges are curved more rearwardly. The lens surfaces 61a of the left and right headlamps 61 and the lens surfaces 62b of the left and right front winkers 62 are also curved similarly to the inclined front wall portion 51a allowing them to be arranged on the curved surface of the inclined front wall portion 51a.<br>
The following description will be made with reference to Figs. 3 to 5 showing the left front winker 62. The right front winker 62 is bilaterally symmetric to the left front<br><br>
winker 62. [0029]<br>
The front winkers 62 each have a lamp body 63 including a housing 64 and a lens 65, a light source, i.e. a bulb 66, and a main reflector 67 which reflects the light from the bulb 66 (i.e. bulb light) mostly forwardly of the vehicle, the bulb 66 and the main reflector 67 being disposed inside the lamp body 63.<br>
The lamp body 63 extends from an upper end portion of the lens surface 61a of the headlamp 61 upwardly and rearwardly until reaching a laterally outward, upper end corner portion of the inclined front wall portion 51a. The outer surface of the lamp body 63 makes up the lens surface 62a. An end portion (base end portion 68) toward the headlamp 61 of the lamp body 63 (lens surface 62a) projects toward the headlamp 61 triangularly as viewed from a side. The upper and lower sides of the base end portion 68 of the lamp body 63 (lens surface 62a) are denoted by reference codes 68a and 68b, respectively (see Fig. 3). [0030]<br>
An end portion 69 toward the upper end of the inclined front wall portion 51a of the lamp body 63 (lens surface 62a) extends, over a short length near the laterally outward upper end corner of the inclined front wall portion 51a, rearwardly and downwardly with its rear end portion linearly cut such that the linearly cut rear end portion extends relatively steeply rearwardly and upwardly thereby forming an upper side edge (rear edge) of<br><br>
the inclined front wall portion 51a. The upper side, lower side, and end edge (rear side) of the end portion 69 of the lamp body 63 (lens surface 62a) are denoted by reference codes 69a, 69b, and 69c, respectively. The upper inclined side extending from the upper side 68a of the base end portion 68 to the upper side 69a of the end portion 69 is denoted by reference code 63a; and the lower inclined side extending from the lower side 68b of the base end portion 68 to the lower side 69b of the end portion 69 is denoted by reference code 63b (see Fig. 3). [0031]<br>
A base end portion of the lamp body 63 is used as a main lamp chamber 71 accommodating the bulb 66 and the main reflector 67. A portion more toward the end portion than the main lamp chamber 71 is of the lamp body 63 is used as a subsidiary lamp chamber 72 into which the bulb light can be introduced only through a slit 81 being described later. [0032]<br>
The housing 64 is made of an opaque resin (light non-transmissive resin through which the bulb light cannot be transmitted) such as an ABS resin. In a portion toward the lamp body base end of the housing 64, a flat bottom wall portion 73 is inclinedly formed such that its rear side is positioned laterally outwardly. A wall-like main reflector 67 is erected laterally outwardly (toward the lens 65) at a rear end portion of the bottom wall portion 73. [0033]<br>
The main reflector 67 partitions the inner space of<br><br>
the lamp'body 63 into two, one on the base end side, i.e. the main lamp chamber 71, and the other on the upper end side, i.e. the subsidiary lamp chamber 72. In the following, the portion more toward the lamp body base end than the main reflector 67 is of the housing 64   will be referred to as a main housing 64a, and the portion more toward the lamp body upper end than the main reflector 67 is will be referred to as a sub-housing 64b. [0034]<br>
A hole 73a to which a bulb socket 66a to hold the bulb 66 is attached is formed in a portion near the main reflector 67 of the bottom wall portion 73. In the main lamp chamber 71, the bulb 66 held by the bulb socket 66a that is attached to the hole 73a projects perpendicularly to the bottom wall portion 73. A rearwardly convexly curved reflection surface 67a of the main reflector 67 is disposed behind the bulb 66. [0035]<br>
The lens 65 is made of a transparent or translucent resin (light transmissive resin through which the bulb light can be transmitted) such as an acrylic resin. It is formed such that its tallest portion is located toward the lamp body base end and such that it bulges, in an installed state, forwardly and laterally outwardly. The outer surface of the lens 65 makes up the outer surface of the lamp body 63, i.e. the lens surface 62a. [0036]<br>
The projecting end of the main reflector 67 is<br><br>
closely adjacent to the inner surface of the lens 65. In the following, the portion more toward the lamp body base end than the main reflector 67 is of the lens 65 will be referred to as a main lens 65a, and the portion more toward the lamp body upper end than the main reflector 67 is of the lens 65 will be referred to as a sub-lens 65b. The main lens 65a and the main housing 64a make up the main lamp chamber 71. The sub-lens 65b and the sub-housing 64b make up the subsidiary lamp chamber 72. [0037]<br>
The lens 65 has a support wall 74 projecting from an outer peripheral portion thereof toward the housing 64 (see Fig. 5). The support wall 74 is fixedly fitted, via a sealing material, into a fitting portion 75 formed in an outer peripheral portion of the housing 64. This integrates the lens 65 and the housing 64 to make up the lamp body 63. [0038]<br>
The housing 64 includes, in an upper portion thereof, an extended portion 76 making up (or being overlapped with) a portion of the inclined front wall portion 51a. The extended portion 76 has an upper inclined side 76a extending approximately in parallel with the lower inclined side 63b of the lamp body 63 (see Fig. 3). The extended portion 76 is slenderly shaped having a width increasingly larger toward one end so that, when fitted in place, it extends from the upper side 68a of the base end portion 68 of the lamp body 63 to the laterally outer side of the upper end portion of the inclined front wall portion 51a.<br><br>
[0039]<br>
The main reflector 67 disposed in the housing 64 has, at an intermediate portion in the upper-lower direction thereof, a U-shaped slit 81 having an open end toward the lens 65 (laterally outer side). A slender sub-reflector 82 is formed in an intermediate portion in the upper-lower direction of the sub-housing 64b, the sub-reflector 82 extending from the bottom (laterally inner end portion) of the slit 81 rearwardly and upwardly behind (at rear of) the main reflector 67. [0040]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the sub-reflector 82 is disposed to extend rearwardly and upwardly along the direction in which the bulb light introduced into the subsidiary lamp chamber 72 through the slit 81 advances. The sub-reflector 82 has a surface which faces laterally outwardly (toward the lens 65) and which is jaggedly formed like, as sectionally viewed, saw teeth having reflection surfaces 82a and 82b. The sub-reflector 82 and the main reflector 67 are formed integrally as a part of the housing 64. [0041]<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, a width h2 in the upper-lower direction (width in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the sub-reflector 82 extends) of the sub-reflector 82 is approximately the same as a width hi (in the upper-lower direction) of the slit 81. The sub-reflector 82 extends, in the vicinity of a laterally outer edge 51c (see Fig. 3) of an upper portion of the front<br><br>
cover 51'(inclined front wall portion 51a), upwardly and<br>
rearwardly along the laterally outer edge 51c.<br>
[0042]<br>
Referring to Fig. 5 again, in the following description, the reflection surfaces inclined to face toward the lamp body base end will be referred to as the first reflection surfaces 82a, and the reflection surfaces inclined to face toward the lamp body upper end will be referred to as the second reflection surfaces 82b. The first reflection surfaces 82a are more inclined than the second reflection surfaces 82b with respect to the direction along which the sub-reflector 82 extends. The surface on the lens 65 side, including the reflection surfaces of the reflectors 67 and 82, of the housing 64 is coated with evaporated aluminum capable of reflecting the bulb light. [0043]<br>
Most of the light from the bulb 66 reaches the main lens 65a by being reflected from the reflection surface 67a of the main reflector 67 (or directly) to be then transmitted through the main lens 65a to illuminate mostly an area forward of the vehicle. Part of the light is introduced, through the slit 81, into the subsidiary lamp chamber 72 and reaches the sub-lens 65b by being reflected from the first reflection surfaces 82a of the sub-reflector 82 (or directly) to be then transmitted through the sub-lens 65b to illuminate mostly an area sideward of the vehicle.<br><br>
[00A4]<br>
The main lens 65a is a clear lens having no lens-cut portion, so that the bulb light reaching the main lens 65a is transmitted without being diffused.<br>
The sub-lens 65b has, at least at a portion thereof facing the sub-reflector 82, a lens-cut portion 83 which has, for example, a prism-cut inside surface, so that the bulb light reaching the sub-lens 65b by being reflected from the first reflection surfaces 82a of the sub-reflector 82 (or directly) is transmitted, being appropriately distributed by the lens-cut portion 83, through the sub-lens 65b. [0045]<br>
Even though the lens-cut portion 83 transmits almost the whole bulb light received in directions approximately perpendicular thereto, it transmits only about half the bulb light received in directions inclined by a prescribed angle or more from the direction perpendicular to it, and reflects the rest of the bulb light.<br>
The bulb light (denoted by arrows LI in Fig, 5) reflected from the first reflection surfaces 82a of the sub-reflector 82 is distributed in directions approximately perpendicular to the lens-cut portion 83. Therefore, almost the whole bulb light reflected from the first reflection surfaces 82a of the sub-reflector 82 is transmitted through the lens-cut portion 83 and illuminates an area sideward of the vehicle. [0046]<br><br>
The' bulb light (denoted by arrow L2 in Fig. 5) directly reaching the lens-cut portion 83 through the slit 81 is inclined at a prescribed angle or more from the direction perpendicular to the lens-cut portion 83, so that approximately a half of the bulb light is transmitted through the lens-cut portion 83 and illuminates the area sideward of the vehicle whereas the rest of the bulb light is reflected from the lens-cut portion 83 and distributed toward the sub-reflector 82. The reflected light is re-reflected from the second reflection surfaces 82b of the sub-reflector 82 toward the lens 65 and the lamp body upper end. The bulb light thus re-reflected is inclined by more than the prescribed angle from the direction perpendicular to the lens-cut portion 83. [0047]<br>
Thus, the bulb light directly reaching the lens-cut portion 83 through the slit 81 is repeatedly reflected and attenuated between the sub-reflector 82 and the lens-cut portion 83 until reaching the upper end of the sub-reflector 82.<br>
The combination of the sub-reflector 82 and the lens-cut portion 83 allows the sub-lens 65b provided for the subsidiary lamp chamber 72 extending rearwardly and upwardly of the main lamp chamber 71 to have a slender light-emitting portion. This realizes a novel front-winker appearance which is not obtained from existing front winkers. [0048]<br><br>
As 'described above, in the vehicular lighting device structure according to the above embodiment, the front winker 62 is provided with the bulb 66 and the main reflector 67 both disposed in the lamp body 63 that includes the housing 54 and the lens 65, and the bulb light from the bulb 66 can be distributed in a direction different from the direction of reflection by the main reflector 67. In the vehicular lighting device structure: the main reflector 67 has the.slit 81 through which the bulb light is led to behind the main reflector 67, and the sub-reflector 82 is provided behind the main reflector 67, the sub-reflector 82 extending along the direction in which the bulb light led through the slit 81 advances; and the bulb light led to behind the main reflector 67 through the slit 81 is distributed by the sub-reflector 82 in a direction different from the direction of reflection by the main reflector 67. [0049]<br>
By structure, when the bulb light is distributed in a direction'different from the direction of reflection by the main reflector 67, the bulb light led to behind the main reflector 67 is distributed in a desired direction by the sub-reflector 82, so that, compared with cases in which the bulb light is merely leaked in the different direction, diffusion of the bulb light is reduced making it possible to accurately distribute the bulb light in the different direction while securing adequate brightness of the bulb light. This adds to the functions of the lighting device<br><br>
and enhahces its merchantability.<br>
The sub-reflector 82 extends along the direction in which the bulb light led through the slit 81 advances, allowing the lens 65 to have a slender light emitting portion. This improves the vehicle appearance by causing the vehicle to look sharp and novel. [0050]<br>
Also, in the vehicular lighting device structure, the sub-reflector 82 is formed with the. stepped reflection surfaces 82a and 82b. This makes it possible to evenly and efficiently distribute the bulb light led through the slit 81 along the direction in which the sub-reflector 82 extends. [0051]<br>
Furthermore, in the vehicular lighting device structure, the lens 65 has, at least on an inside surface portion thereof facing the sub-reflector 82, a lens-cut portion to reflect part of the bulb light toward the sub-reflector 82. This allows the bulb light directly reaching the lens 65 through the slit 81 to be reflected toward the sub-reflector 82, so that the bulb light led through the slit 81 can be securely distributed without being wasted. [0052]<br>
In addition, in the vehicular lighting device structure, the sub-reflector 82 and the main reflector 67 are integrally formed. This can reduce the number of parts to be assembled to facilitate assembly work. As a result, the cost and weight of the device can be reduced.<br><br>
[0053]<br>
Furthermore, in the vehicular lighting device structure, the width h1 of the slit 81 a-nd the width h2 of the sub-reflector 82 are approximately the same. This allows a slender and sharp light emitting portion to be formed efficiently. [0054]<br>
Furthermore, in the vehicular lighting device structure, the front winker 62 is for installation on each of the left and right sides of the front cover 51 of the motorcycle 1 such that, on each of the left and right sides, the sub-reflector 82 is disposed, behind the main reflector 67 and near the laterally outer edge 51c of the front cover 51, to extend upwardly and rearwardly along the laterally outer edge 51c. As a result, the light emitting portion of the sub-reflector 82 is disposed near the laterally outer edge 51c of the front cover 51 of the motorcycle 1 and extends upwardly and rearwardly. This enlarges the vertical dimension of the area illuminated by the light emitting portion and improves the visibility of the front winker 62. [0055]<br>
In addition, in the vehicular lighting device structure, on each of the left and right sides, the front winker 62 is disposed upwardly continuously from the headlamp 61 laterally inwardly disposed on the front cover 51, allowing the light emitting portions of the head lamp 61 and front winker 62 to extend from a laterally inner portion to a laterally outer portion close to the laterally<br><br>
outer edge 51c of the front cover 51 of the motorcycle 1. This makes it easier for people to grasp information on the condition of the motorcycle 1, for example, assessing the speed of or the distance from the motorcycle 1. The front winker 62 disposed integrally with and upwardly of the head lamp 61 improves the appearance of the motorcycle 1.<br>
Compared with four-wheeled vehicles, motorcycles are narrower in width, so that it is relatively difficult for people to assess the speed of or the distance from the vehicle. Disposing lighting devices in a laterally wide upper portion of the vehicle with their light emitting portions extending long in the upper-lower direction improves the visibility of the motorcycle and makes it easier for people to assess the speed of and the distance from the motorcycle. [0056]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above embodiment. It may be applied not only to front winkers but also to other types of vehicular lighting devices such as headlamps, rear winkers, and tail lamps.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an example in which left and right front position lamps 62' structured identically to the left and right front winkers 62 are adopted instead of the left and right front winkers 62. In this case, left and right front winkers 62" are disposed, for example, on left and right parts of the handlebar cover 57.<br>
The sub-lens 65b covering an area along the direction of reflection by the sub-reflector 82 may have a lens-cut<br><br>
portion 'extending over the entire inner surface thereof, or it may have no lens-cut portion. Similarly, the main lens 65a covering an area along the direction of reflection by the main reflector 67 may have a lens-cut portion on either a part of or the whole of the inner surface thereof.<br>
The structure of the above embodiment is only an example of the present invention. The present invention can also be applied to three- or four-wheeled saddle-ride type vehicles. It goes without saying that the present invention can be modified in various ways, for example, as to part configuration, structure, shape, size, quantity, and arrangement without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
