				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing coal charge blend for<br>
carbonization and, in particular, to preparation of a coal charge blend directed to<br>
obtaining proper blend homogeneity and reduced micofines generation in the coal blend<br>
for effective and productive carbonization. The invention is also directed to improve bulk<br>
density of coal ctarge blend and also increase the abrasion streingth of coke obtained on<br>
carbonization thereby enhanong blast furnace productivity. The mvention thus avoids<br>
limitations of conventional coal charge preparation and carbonization resulting from<br>
varying charastistics of input coats and is directed to improve productivity and provide<br>
for a more controlled and cost effective generation of coke.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that for carbonization of coal the coal charge bfend is prepared and<br>
subsequently subjected to the carbonization such as in slot type ovens<br>
Usually, tne conventional practice of coal preparation for carbonization comprises mixing<br>
of input coals in adequate proportion and crushing to predetermine degree of fineness<br>
(82+/-2% below 3.2mm). It is experienced that the input coal for such coaf preparation<br>
for carbonization vary widely in size, grindability as well as quality parameters. This<br>
results in improper blend homogeneity and excessive microfines (
Thus the crushed change usually contain higher coarser size fraction (+6 3mm of 8-10%)<br>
and microfines in the range of about 50-55%. Due to such varying characteristics of coal<br>
bfend the coke obtained from carbonization shows poor abrasion strength properties (M-<br>
to) resulting higher coke consumption and lower blast furnace productivity.<br>
It would be dearly apparent from the above that presently followed processes of coal<br>
preparation for carbonization does not therefore address to the need for desired<br>
homogeneity of coal blend which is usually sourced from variety of sources of varying<br>
qualities of grain size, distribution and fines content. Such improper blend of the<br>
available coal charge is found to affect productivity with higher coke consumption and<br>
less productivity, which in turn also make the process of carbonization cost extensive<br>
Moreover, the coke obtained following use of such improper coal blend also have poor<br>
abrasion strength properties, which contribute towards higher coke consumption. It is,<br>
therefore, evident from the above conventional state of the art that the presently<br>
followed method of random mixing and crushing the input coals together result in non-<br>
homogeneity and excess fines generation since softer coals get crushed to a higher<br>
2<br><br>
degree than the harder ones. This necessarily affects the carbonization and coke<br>
characteristics as well as the productivity of the blast furnace.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the baste object of the present invention to provide for a process of preparing<br>
coal blend for carbonization which would take care of the afore discussed problems and<br>
complexities of having randomly mixed coal blend of different sources of vaned qualities<br>
which lead to improper blend homogeneity and affected productivity<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a method of coal blend for<br>
carbonization, which would enable generation of coal blend with desired homogeneity<br>
and reduced miorofines generation.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a method of preparing<br>
of coal blend from different sources of vaned qualities of coal which would have optimum<br>
grain size distribution and fines content.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a methodology for coal<br>
preparation based on hard groove grindabilrty index (HGI) indlces of input coals so as to<br>
obtain proper blend homogeneity and reduced microfine generation in the preparation of<br>
coal blend.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to a methodology of coal biend<br>
preparation based on gnndability characteristic of input coal from variety of sources<br>
which is determinant of an intrinsic property and guided by nature and quality<br>
(structure, bonding etc) which can vary from coal to coal.<br>
Vet further object of the present invention is directed to a process of coal preparation for<br>
carbonization which would provide for much desired flexibility in choosing the biend,<br>
maintaining homogeneity and improvement in bulk density of coal charge blend.<br>
A further object of the present invention in directed to enhancing coal utilization and<br>
blast furnace productivity by way of providing a selective process of coal preparation<br>
having optimum gram size distribution and fines content with improved bulk density of<br>
coal charge which would favour increasing the abrasion strength of coke (M10) obtained<br>
on carbonizing the blend with enhanced blast furnace productivity.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present Invention there is provided a method of<br>
preparing a coal charge blend with desired hwnogeneity for carbontration comprising,<br>
determining the Hard Groove Grindability Index (HGI) of input coals;<br>
subjecting the input coals to differential crushing based on the said Hard Groove<br>
Grindability Index to thereby crash the input coal varieties selectively to obtain a proper<br>
coal blend homogeneity and reduced micro fines in the coal blend far carbonization<br>
Importantly, in the above process the input coals are divided into different categories for<br>
selective differential crushing based on the grindabiltty indices (HGI), content of coarse<br>
size (+ 6.3 mm) and fines (- 0 6mm) size fractions of incoming coals. The differential<br>
crushing of the input coal varieties are tarrid out such as to obtain optimum toke<br>
quality (strength).<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention the categorizing of the<br>
input coals is done into three categories comprising Category I being coal harder to<br>
crush and required to be crushed to a higher degree of fineness Category III being coals<br>
representing varieties softer to crush and required to be crushed to a lower degree of<br>
fineness and an intermediate Category II being coal varieties which can be<br>
accommodated in either Category I or Category III as per the plant logistics and end<br>
requirements.<br>
Thus to the above process of the invention the incoming coal varieties are categorized<br>
selectively based on their properties including structure, bonding, HGI, content of coarse<br>
and fine fractions, caking and coking characteristics.<br>
After the above categorization of the incoming coal varieties the same are subjected to<br>
differential crushing comprising using a set of crushers where the grouped/categorized<br>
coats are crushed differentially selected from high, medium and coarse degree<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
coal carbonization such as in slot type ovens comprising:<br>
4<br><br>
(a) Preparing a substantially homogeneous coal charges blend following<br>
determining the Hard Groove Grindability Index (HGI) of input coals and<br>
subjecting the input coals to differential cashing based on the said Hard<br>
Groove Grindability index to thereby crush the input coal varieties<br>
setectively to obtain a proper coal blend homogeneity and reduced micro<br>
fines; and<br>
(b) 	Subjecting the thus obtained proper coal blend of step (i) above to improved<br>
	and mare productive carbonization of coal.<br>
Preferably, in the above method in step (a) above, the input coals are divided into<br>
different categories for selective differential crushing based selectively on the grindability<br>
indices (HGI), content of coarse size (+ 6.3 mm) and fines (- 0 6mm) size fractions of<br>
incoming coals.<br>
Also, the said step (a) of differential crushing of input coat is carred out to Improve the<br>
bulk density of the coal charge biend and also to increase the abrasion strength of coke<br>
(M10) obtained on carbocruzation to enhance blast firnace productivity<br>
It Is thus possible by way of the above method of the invention to provide for<br>
methodology for coal preparation directed to improved productivity in carbonization<br>
process by way of crushing the available sources of input coal selectively in groups based<br>
on hard groove grindability index (HGI) of input coals to get to proper blend<br>
homogeneity and reduce microfine generation<br>
Importantly, the above method of invention takes care of the required vanation of<br>
grindability of variety of coals such grindability being an intrinsic property and guided by<br>
nature and quality such as structure, bonding etc. The invention is therefore basically<br>
directed to grouping) of input coats having similar grindability indices and crushing to the<br>
denned degree of fineness. This provides for the much required control on blend<br>
homogeneity as well as generation of fines. Such a process of invention therefore avoids<br>
the problems of conventional method of random mixing and crushing the input coals<br>
together resulting in non-homogeneity and excess fine generation since softer coals<br>
usually get crushed to a higher degree than the harder ones.<br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect the method of the invention involves dividing<br>
the input coals into different categories preferably 2-3 categories for crushing based on<br>
grindability indices (HGI), content of coarse size (+6.3mm) and fines (-0 6mm) size<br>
fraction of incoming coals. The method therefore achieves controlling the coarse size as<br>
5<br><br>
well fines content by crushing differentially based on the input quality parameters<br>
allowing optimum blend preparation towards achieving optimal coke quality (strength).<br>
Importantly, the method of the invention achieves the much desired flexibility in<br>
choosing the blend, maintaining homogeneity and improvetnent in bulk density of coal<br>
chargt btend.<br>
The details of the invention, its object and advantages are explained hereunder in<br>
greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration as per the following<br>
accompanying figure:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE<br>
Figure 1: is an illustration of differential crushing scheme of the input coals in the<br>
process of preparation of the coal blend in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Reference is invited to figure 1 which schematically illustrates the division of the input<br>
coals based on the coal characteristic of the available varieties in particular the hard<br>
groove grindability index (HGI), content of coarse and fine fraction, caking and coking<br>
etc to obtain the optimum blend homogenerty, composition and coke quality.<br>
As dlearly represented in the said figure for such purpose the input coals can preferably<br>
be divided into three categories.<br>
The above categorisation is basically in terms of two extreme varieties such as, Category<br>
Category III and I. Category I being coals, which are harder to crush and which require<br>
crushing to a hiqher degree of fineness. Category III being representative of the input<br>
coal variety, which are softer to crush and which require crushing to a lower degree of<br>
fineness. The intennediate ones can ne tategonzed as Category III which could be sent<br>
or grouped in either of Category I or Caregory III based on the plant logistics end<br>
requiremente. Preferably, the input coals can be divided into different categories for<br>
crushing based on the grindability indices, content of coarse size (+6 3mm) and fines (-<br>
0.6mrn ) size fraction of incoming coals as further detailed in Table 1 hereunder:<br>
TABlE1<br>
Category	HGI(Range)	Size Content+6mm,%	-0.6mm %<br>
I	50-60	45-65	10-25<br>
II	60-00	30-45	25-50<br>
	80-120	10-30	50-75<br>
6<br><br>
in this way the optimum blend homogeneity and fines content in the coal blend can be<br>
effectively and advantageously controlled and flexibility imparted to coal blend<br>
preparation for effective carbonization<br>
After the input coats are categorized in groups as above they are sent to set of crushers<br>
where the grouped coals are envied differentially (Crushed to high, medium and coarse<br>
degree). The prepared charge blend can be subsequently carbonized and the resultant<br>
coke obtained.<br>
A comparative study of the advantages in abrasion strength (M10) of coke obtained<br>
foltowng the above coal preparation in accordance with the invention involving<br>
differential crushing and the coal blend involving conventional random crushing was<br>
carried out and the results are further illustrated in following Table 2.<br>
TABLE 2<br>
Coal blend sizefraction	Conventional crushing	Differentialcrashing<br>
+6.3 mm	8.5	7-0<br>
-0.6 mm	53.4	46.9<br>
-3.2 mm	81.8	83.1<br>
Abrasion strength ofcoke M10	9.1	8-8<br>
It would be dearly apparent from the above that the process of the invention including<br>
the selective coal preparation for carbonization is found to improve bulk density of coal<br>
charge blend as well as increase the abrasion strength of coke (M10) obtained on<br>
carbonization of the blend to -slot oven for enhancing blast furnace productivity.<br>
It is thus possible by way of present invention to characterize the Input coals (from<br>
available sources) in terms of grmdability indices, content of coarse (+6.3mm) and fine<br>
fraction (+0.6mm) and caking and coking properties and subject the thus categorized<br>
input coals to differential crushing to reach to the proper homogeneous blend with<br>
reduced microfines for effective carbonization with improved coke quality (Abrasion<br>
Resistance).<br>
