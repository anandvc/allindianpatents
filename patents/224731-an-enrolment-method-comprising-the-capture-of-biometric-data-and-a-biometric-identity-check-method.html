				<td>An Enrolment Method Comprising The Capture,Of Biometric<br>
Data And A Biometric Identity Check Method<br>
The invention concerns the biometric identification<br>
of a user of a system. It is adapted to an identity<br>
check on a portable object of the chip card type.<br>
One method normally used for identifying a user is<br>
based on a secret identification code, also referred to<br>
as a PIN (standing for Personal Identification Number<br>
in English) . In a system using chip cards, a user<br>
enters his PIN code on a transaction terminal, which<br>
then transfers the PIN code entered to the chip card,<br>
which checks the PIN code by comparison with a<br>
reference PIN code. The security of such a system is<br>
guaranteed by the fact that the reference PIN code is<br>
stored within the chip card, by nature protected, and<br>
never leaves it during the identity check process,<br>
since the final check is made by the card. The<br>
drawbacks of such a system are the fact that the owner<br>
of the card must memorise a secret and the fact that<br>
another user can commit fraud by stealing this secret.<br>
Biometrics consists of acquiring, measuring and<br>
recognising physical characteristics of a user. It<br>
makes it possible to directly identify a user whilst<br>
the PIN code method allows indirect identification by<br>
the fact of checking that the user knows a secret.<br>
Amongst the known techniques in biometrics, there are<br>
the methods of recognising voice characteristics,<br>
characteristics peculiar to the shape of the face or to<br>
the iris of the eye or, in the most frequent case,<br>
fingerprint characteristics.<br>
All the existing biometric identity check systems<br>
are broken down into three phases:<br>
- the first phase is a phase of capturing biometric<br>
data from a sensor. These biometric data obtained are<br>
usually images, for example in the case of<br>
fingerprints, iris or face shape. However, it can also<br>
be a case of sound sequences in the case of voice<br>
recognition.<br>
- The second phase is an analysis or extraction<br>
phase for extracting a biometric signature from<br>
biometric data captured during the first phase, this<br>
signature being composed of a more restricted set of<br>
particular biometric data. This second phase is<br>
extremely complex and requires high calculation power.<br>
The third phase consists of comparing the<br>
biometric signature obtained during the second phase<br>
with a reference signature defined previously during a<br>
procedure called enrolling.<br>
Portable electronic objects of the chip card type<br>
are provided with microprocessors whose calculation<br>
power is still limited. This is why a biometric system<br>
of the prior art using chip cards functions as follows:<br>
- in the enrolling phase, a reference biometric<br>
signature of the user of the card is stored in a secure<br>
memory of the chip card.<br>
- in the identity check phase, a terminal captures<br>
the biometric data of the user and then extracts a<br>
biometric signature. Two solutions then exist:<br>
either the reference biometric<br>
signature is transferred from the card to the terminal<br>
for a check on the identity, by comparing the two<br>
signatures, on the terminal: this method has the<br>
drawback that the reference signature may be<br>
intercepted, which is a security failing. A<br>
conventional identification by PIN code does not have<br>
this drawback;<br>
- or the biometric signature extracted<br>
is transferred to the card for a check on the card.<br>
The card having only a low calculation capacity, the<br>
check is a complex operation, which requires a long<br>
processing time. This represents a drawback compared<br>
with the conventional use of a PIN code.<br>
One object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
biometric identification solution which is both secure<br>
and simple, adapted to an identity check on an object<br>
of the chip card type.<br>
The solution is based on an enrolment method<br>
comprising the capture of biometric data, the<br>
extraction of a true biometric signature composed of<br>
true particular biometric data, characterised in that<br>
it comprises the following steps:<br>
- producing false particular biometric data,<br>
- generating the obscured biometric signature<br>
by combining the false particular biometric data<br>
with the particular true biometric data,<br>
producing an authentication code which<br>
indicates which are the false and true particular<br>
biometric data of the obscured biometric signature.<br>
The false particular biometric data can be<br>
produced consistently with the true particular<br>
biometric data. For this, at least one false particular<br>
biometric data item can be produced by slightly<br>
transforming a true biometric data item;<br>
- in the case of minutiae which correspond to<br>
fingerprint data of a first finger, at least one<br>
false minutiae can be produced from minutiae of a<br>
second finger;<br>
- a false particular biometric data item can<br>
also be produced by detecting a true biometric<br>
data item having a geometry relatively close to a<br>
true particular biometric data item and<br>
transforming this true biometric data item in<br>
order to create the false particular biometric<br>
data item.<br>
The authentication code can be established<br>
according to the following steps:<br>
- the particular biometric data of the obscured<br>
biometric signature are ordered;<br>
- the authentication code is composed of a series<br>
of bits, with a length equal to the total number of<br>
true and false particular biometric data of the<br>
obscured biometric signature, each bit indicating<br>
respectively whether the corresponding particular<br>
biometric data item is true or false.<br>
The obscured biometric signature and the<br>
authentication code can be recorded in a secure memory<br>
of a personal object of the chip card type.<br>
The solution also proposes a biometric identity<br>
check method comprising the capture of biometric data<br>
and the extraction of a true biometric signature<br>
composed of true particular biometric data, and<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
- comparing the true biometric signature with<br>
an obscured biometric signature,<br>
- producing a code indicating the true and<br>
false biometric data on the basis of the previous<br>
comparison with the true biometric signature,<br>
- comparing this code with an authentication<br>
code indicating the true and false particular<br>
biometric data of the obscured biometric signature.<br>
In this method, the authentication code can be<br>
stored in a secure memory of a personal object and the<br>
comparison of the code and authentication code can take<br>
place within the personal object.<br>
The biometric identity check method for accessing<br>
a service by means of a services terminal, based on a<br>
personal object of the chip card type for storing the<br>
authentication code and the obscured biometric<br>
signature, can comprise the following steps:<br>
- transferring the obscured biometric signature<br>
from the personal object to the service terminal for<br>
the comparison of the true biometric signature with the<br>
obscured biometric signature and producing the code<br>
within the service terminal;<br>
- transferring the code from the service terminal<br>
to the personal object for comparison of the code with<br>
the authentication code on the personal object.<br>
The invention is also based on an enrolment<br>
device using biometric signature extraction software in<br>
order to obtain a true biometric signature composed of<br>
true particular biometric data from captured biometric<br>
data, using obscuring software consisting firstly of<br>
producing false particular biometric data and combining<br>
them with the true particular biometric data in order<br>
to obtain an obscured biometric signature, and secondly<br>
producing an authentication code for indicating the<br>
true and false particular biometric data of the<br>
obscured biometric signature.<br>
 The enrolment device can comprise a device for<br>
communication with a personal object of the chip card<br>
type suitable for transferring the obscured biometric<br>
signature and the authentication code to the personal<br>
object -<br>
The invention also proposes a personal object<br>
comprising a secure memory and a communication means<br>
and comprising in its secure memory an obscured<br>
biometric signature and an authentication code and<br>
comprising a means of comparing a code transferred by<br>
the communication means with the authentication code.<br>
This personal object may be a medium with a chip of the<br>
chip card type.<br>
The invention also proposes a service terminal<br>
using extraction software in order to obtain a true<br>
biometric signature composed of true particular<br>
biometric data from captured biometric data and using<br>
software for producing a code from a comparison between<br>
the true biometric signature and an obscured biometric<br>
signature, the code indicating the true and false<br><br>
biometric data on the basis of the true biometric<br>
signature calculated by the service terminal.<br>
This service terminal can comprise a<br>
communication device for communicating with a personal<br>
object of the chip card type, able to transfer the<br>
obscured biometric signature from the personal object<br>
and the code produced to the personal object.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention will emerge from a reading of the following<br>
description of particular example embodiments, given<br>
for illustrative purposes and non-limitingly, and the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
- Figure 1 depicts examples of minutiae of<br>
fingerprints;<br>
- Figure 2 depicts examples of the creation of false<br>
minutiae;<br>
- Figure 3 depicts a simplified example of the<br>
creation of an obscured signature and of the<br>
authentication code according to the invention.<br>
One embodiment of the invention will be described in<br>
the context of an identification by fingerprint in a<br>
banking application.<br>
A user is provided with a chip card possessing a secure<br>
memory and a biometric identity check function which<br>
will be detailed below.<br>
During the enrolment phase, which consists of storing<br>
the reference biometric signature on the card, the user<br>
goes to a secure place such as a bank branch for<br>
example, where his fingerprint is captured on a special<br>
terminal. An extraction algorithm of the prior art,<br>
whose principle consists of selecting particular<br>
biometric data from the captured fingerprint, referred<br>
to as minutiae, derives therefrom the biometric<br>
signature composed of these minutiae. To facilitate<br>
understanding of the remainder of the description, the<br>
terms true minutiae and true biometric signature will<br>
be used for these data obtained according to the<br>
calculation of the prior art. These true minutiae are<br>
for example identified by data indicating their<br>
position, plus a data item indicating their type.<br>
Figure 1 shows two examples of types of minutiae, a<br>
line bifurcation (Fig. la) and a line end (Fig. lb) .<br>
The number of minutiae to be selected by the extraction<br>
algorithm is predefined in order to obtain a good<br>
compromise between security and calculation complexity.<br>
According to the method of the invention, before the<br>
recording of the signature on the chip card, the<br>
enrolment terminal uses obscuring software in order to<br>
transform the previous true biometric signature. This<br>
obscuring software uses an obscuring method which<br>
consists of combining the true minutiae previously<br>
extracted and making up the true biometric signature<br>
with false data which will . be referred to as false<br>
minutiae, so as to obtain an obscured biometric<br>
signature.<br>
One characteristic of the obscuring method consists of<br>
defining false minutiae which are consistent with the<br>
true minutiae in order to make the operation consisting<br>
of finding the true biometric signature from the<br>
obscured signature difficult or impossible. For this,<br>
it is possible to use the following methods:<br>
- according to a first variant, the sensor of the bank<br>
terminal captures more minutiae than the predefined<br>
number. The additional minutiae are then slightly<br>
transformed in order to obtain false minutiae. This<br>
transformation can consist of a modification of the<br>
coordinates of the minutiae by a rotation or<br>
translation, or a modification of their type;<br>
- according to a second variant close to the previous<br>
one, it is possible to obtain the false minutiae by<br>
transforming minutiae obtained during the capture of<br>
the print from another finger. It will then be arranged<br>
to keep only false minutiae not too close to the true<br>
minutiae selected in order to preserve consistency of<br>
the whole. The advantage of this variant is that it is<br>
applicable in cases where the number of minutiae of a<br>
single print is small;<br>
- according to a third variant, amongst the capture<br>
biometric data, relatively close geometries of true<br>
minutiae are detected and are transformed in order to<br>
create false minutiae consistent with the global<br>
geometry of the fingerprint. This transformation is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2sl depicts a true<br>
geometry which is transformed into a false minutiae of<br>
the bifurcation type depicted in Figure 2a2. Figure 2bl<br>
depicts a true geometry which is transformed into a<br>
false minutiae of the line end type depicted in Figure<br>
2b2.<br>
Combining the false and true minutiae makes it possible<br>
to obtain the obscured biometric signature. At the same<br>
time, the obscuring method generates an authentication<br>
code whose content indicates the minutiae which are<br>
true and false in the obscured signature. In order to<br>
produce this authentication code, the minutiae are<br>
first of all ordered in a well defined order, by<br>
choosing for example a geometric origin and then<br>
classifying the minutiae according to their position<br>
with respect to this origin. Then the authentication<br>
code is established in the form of a list of zeros and<br>
ones, the zeros indicating that a minutiae is false and<br>
the ones that the minutiae are true, or vice-versa.<br>
This authentication code therefore has as its dimension<br>
a number of bits equal to the total number of minutiae<br>
of the obscured signature. Figure 3 illustrates a<br>
simplified example of the production of an obscured<br>
signature and of the associated authentication code.<br>
Figure 3a depicts a fingerprint, Figure 3b depicts the<br>
two true minutiae (represented by a solid circle)<br>
extracted from the fingerprint by the extraction<br>
algorithm, Figure 3c depicts the obscured signature,<br>
which was produced by adding two false minutiae<br>
(represented by an empty circle), Figure 3d depicts the<br>
same minutiae ordered and Figure 3e depicts the<br>
associated authentication code.<br>
The enrolment phase ends with the storage of the<br>
obscured "biotmetric . signature and the authentication<br>
code in the non-volatile memory (EEPROM, FLASH etc) of<br>
the chip card. These data require a relatively small<br>
amount of memory space of a few tens of bytes.<br>
After the enrolment, the bank card can be used to make<br>
payments, access banking services etc. Each operation<br>
requires a phase of checking the identity of the user,<br>
which comprises the following steps:<br>
- the service terminal, for example a cash dispenser,<br>
captures the fingerprint of the user;<br>
- the terminal calculates the true biometric signature<br>
from this fingerprint by means of the same extraction<br>
algorithm as that used during the enrolment phase;<br>
- the card transfers the obscured biometric signature<br>
to the terminal. It should be noted that this method<br>
has the advantage, unlike the prior art, of not<br>
transferring the true reference biometric signature;<br>
- the terminal compares the true biometric signature<br>
with the obscured biometric signature transferred by<br>
the card and derives therefrom a code representing the<br>
differences between the two signatures, according to a<br>
calculation similar to that of the production of the<br>
authentication code described during the enrolment<br>
phase. This code represents the true and false minutiae<br>
on the basis of the true biometric signature derived<br>
from the captured fingerprint. This code must be almost<br>
identical to the authentication code if the user is<br>
indeed the correct person;<br>
- the code obtained is transferred from the terminal to<br>
the chip card;<br>
- the chip card comprises a means, in software or<br>
hardware form, which makes it possible to compare (for<br>
example by means of an XOR function) the code received<br>
and the. authentication code, stored in the memory<br>
during the enrolment phase. If the codes are<br>
sufficiently identical with respect to the predefined<br>
tolerance, then the card returns to the terminal a<br>
positive message validating the identity of the user.<br>
A first advantage of this method is its flexibility: it<br>
is possible to choose a number of true and false<br>
minutiae according to the security requirements and<br>
processing time required. One of the most simple<br>
implementations with the use of 10 true and 10 false<br>
minutiae, and with a tolerance consisting of accepting<br>
the error of one minutiae in the checking calculation,<br>
gives rise to a rate of false acceptance of 1 in 10,000<br>
and a processing time by the card of the same order as<br>
the checking of a PIN code.<br>
This method also has the same advantages of the system<br>
of the prior art based on PIN codes since firstly there<br>
is no longer any transfer of confidential information<br>
from the card to the terminal and since moreover the<br>
checking calculation implemented within the card is<br>
very simple. It should be noted that the authentication<br>
code fulfils a role similar to the PIN code of the<br>
solutions of identification by PIN code as described<br>
previously. Moreover, this method of course includes<br>
the advantages of biometrics. The invention therefore<br>
makes it possible to combine the advantages of<br>
biometrics and PIN code.<br>
The invention, as described in this embodiment, is<br>
implemented by means of various devices comprising the<br>
following particular functionalities:<br>
- obscuring software based on a method of producing<br>
false minutiae, combining false and true minutiae in<br>
order to produce an obscured biometric signature and an<br>
authentication code, implemented 'during an enrolment<br>
phase on a secure terminal of a service provider such<br>
as a bank;<br>
software for comparing an extracted biometric<br>
signature with an obscured biometric signature,<br>
generating a code, used on a service terminal during an<br>
identity check phase;<br>
a code check means used on the card which also<br>
possesses a secure memory for containing an<br>
authentication code and a reference obscured biometric<br>
signature.<br>
The methods of the invention are of course adapted to<br>
other fields of biometrics, using similar mechanisms<br>
based on particular biometric data, fulfilling the role<br>
of fingerprint minutiae. False particular biometric<br>
data consistent with the true particular biometric data<br>
will also be added.<br>
In addition, the invention is particularly well adapted<br>
to the systems based on personal objects such as chip<br>
cards, possessing few hardware re-sources. It does<br>
however remain applicable to other systems not<br>
necessarily using such an object.<br>

preceding claim, wherein it comprises a device for<br>
communicating with a personal object of the chip card<br>
type able to transfer the obscured biometric signature<br>
and the authentication code to the personal object.<br>
14. A personal object comprising a secure memory<br>
and a communication means, characterised in that it<br>
comprises in its secure memory an obscured biometric<br>
signature and an authentication code and in that it<br>
comprises a means of comparing a code transferred by<br>
the communication means with the authentication code.<br>
15. A personal object as claimed in the<br>
preceding claim, wherein it is a medium with a chip of<br>
the chip card type.<br>
16. A service terminal using extraction software<br>
in order to obtain a true biometric signature composed<br>
of true particular biometric. data from captured<br>
biometric data and using software for producing a code<br>
from a comparison between the true biometric signature<br>
and an obscured biometric signature, the code<br>
indicating the true and false biometric data on the<br>
basis of the true biometric signature calculated by t.he<br>
service terminal.<br>
17. A service terminal as claimed in the<br>
preceding claim, wherein it comprises a communication<br>
device for communicating with a personal object of the<br>
chip card type able to transfer the obscured biometric<br>
signature from the personal object and the code<br>
produced to the personal object.<br>
An Enrolment Method Comprising The Capture Of Biometric<br>
Data And A Biometric Identity Check Method<br>
A method and associated device for checking a<br>
biometric signature by means of a very simple and<br>
secure calculation adapted to objects of the chip card<br>
type.<br>
The method is based on the storage within the<br>
object of an obscured biometric signature and an<br>
associated authentication code, a terminal capturing a<br>
fingerprint compares it with the obscured biometric<br>
signature transmitted by the card and transfers the<br>
result of this comparison to the chip card, which<br>
validates this result with the authentication code.</td>
