Method and System for network search<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to search engine technologies, and particularly, to a method and a system for network search.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In recent years, network search engine technologies have been improved increasingly, and there are three generation search engines by far. The 1st generation search engine performs search by use of the classifying directory made manually; the 2nd generation search engine performs search by machine grabbing, which is a web page search method based on hyperlink analysis; the 3rd generation search engine performs search according to interaction prompts between a computer and a user. The current search engine mainly performs web page search from web pages on the Internet and files associated with the web pages.<br>
At present, there is a p2p-based network search method in the prior art. Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the p2p-based network search technology in the prior art. In Figure 1, Client I is a search initiator and Clients 2 and 3 are the first level clients responding to the search initiated by Client 1; Clients 4 and 5 are connected to Client 2, and Clients 6 and 7 are connected to Client 3; Clients 4, 5, 6 and 7 are the second level clients responding to the search. Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating the p2p-based network search method in the prior art. As shown in Figure 2, the method includes processes as follows.<br>
201: A client initiating search sends a search request to clients connected with the client; the search request is forwarded to other clients connected with the client level by level, and the search request is not forwarded any more after reaching a certain level clients.<br>
For example, Client 1 sends a search request to Clients 2 and 3; Client 2 forwards the search request to Clients 4 and 5, and Client 3 forwards the search request to Clients 6 and 7.<br><br>
202: A client receiving the search request searches for a local resource index, and returns a search result to the client initiating the search request level by level.<br>
For example, Clients 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 respectively search for local resource indices, and respectively return the resource indices which are searched out to Client 1 level by level.<br>
203: The client initiating search collects, sorts and displays the resource indices for the user, and downloads a resource file via a p2p downloading mode.<br>
For example, after receiving the resource indices returned by clients responding to the search request, Client 1 collects, sorts and displays the resource indices, and downloads a resource file selected by the user according to the resource index via the p2p downloading mode; the resource file is downloaded from a client corresponding to the resource file.<br>
In this p2p-based network search method, since the search request sent by the client initiating search needs to be forwarded to various clients level by level, it will take a long time for the search request to reach clients in various levels; similarly, it also takes a long time for the search results of clients in various levels to be reported to the client initiating search level by level. As a result, the response speed of the p2p-based network search technology is very slow, which is unable to meet the instant requirement of network search.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a system for network search, so as to improve the response speed of network search, thereby meeting the instant requirement of network search.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In order to make the object and technical solution of the present invention clearer, a detailed description of the present invention is hereinafter given with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the structure of a network search system in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system as shown in Figure 3 includes: a search initiating client 301 is used for initiating a search request to a resource search server 302, and acquiring network resource according to a resource feature information index returned by the resource search server 302; the resource search server 302 is used for acquiring a search response client 304 corresponding to the search initiating client 301 from a corresponding relation server 303, searching a resource index server 305 according to the search request, and returning the resource feature information index which is searched out to the search initiating client 301; the search response client 304 is used for reporting the resource feature information index of local resource to the resource index server 305; the resource index server 305 is used for storing the resource feature information index reported by the search response client 304; the corresponding relation server 303 is used for providing the search response client 304 corresponding to the search initiating client 301 to the resource search server 302; the search initiating client 301 is connected to the resource search server 302; the resource search server 302 is connected to the resource index server 305 and the corresponding relation server 303 respectively; the resource index server 305 is further connected to the search response client 304.<br><br>
In general, the search initiating client 301 may be an instant messaging client in an instant messaging system or an individual network search initiator.<br>
In addition, the search response client 304 may also be an instant messaging client in an instant messaging system and may be a clients group having a certain corresponding relation with the search initiating client 301. The corresponding relation includes but is not limited to: a friend relation, a college relation, a stranger relation and a family relation. The search response client 304 may also be an individual network search response client.<br>
The search response client 304 has a corresponding relation with the search initiating client 301, which guarantees the correctness and individuation of search results. For example, if both a search initiating client 301 and a search response client 304 are teachers, the search initiating client 301 and the search response client 304 have a colleague relation; when the search initiating client 301 needs to search teaching materials, it is possible to acquire these teaching materials from the search response client 304 having a colleague relation with the search initiating client 301, so as to implement the search individuation and improve the possibility of successful search, thereby guaranteeing the correctness of search results. The matching of the corresponding relation may be implemented by an instant messaging system and the corresponding relation may be stored in an instant messaging server. The matching and storage of the corresponding relation is obvious to the skilled in the prior art.<br>
The search response client 304 needs to provide the resource feature information index of the local resource to the resource index server 305. The search response client 304 may send the feature information index of the local resource to the resource index server 305 periodically or send the resource feature information index of newly-generated local network resource to the resource index server 305 when the search response client 304 generates new local network resource. When the search initiating client 301 initiates a search request to the resource search server 302, the resource search server 302 acquires the search response client 304 corresponding to the search initiating client 301 from the corresponding relation server 303, searches for the resource feature information index of the search response client 304 corresponding to the search initiating client 301 in the resource index server 305, and returns the resource feature information index which is searched out to the search initiating client 301. In this way, the search initiating client 301<br><br>
may acquire the network resource according to the resource feature information index returned by the resource search server 302.<br>
The resource feature information index indicates the method for acquiring network resource. For example, the resource feature information index may include an IP address and port number of the network resource; therefore, the search initiating client 301 may acquire the corresponding network resource via the IP address and port number.<br>
Alternatively, when the search initiating client and the search response client are instant messaging based clients, the corresponding relation server 303 may be an instant messaging server, and the resource feature information index may include the ID number of an instant messaging client having the network resource; therefore, the search initiating client 301 may acquire, according to the ID number, the network resource via a file transmitting channel provided by the instant messaging server.<br>
When there are many search response clients, it is necessary to provide multiple resource index servers, so as to adequately store resource feature information and improve the search speed.<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating the structure of a network search system in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The system as shown in Figure 4 includes: a search initiating client 401 is used for initiating a search request to a resource search server 402, and acquiring network resource according to a resource feature information index returned by the resource search server 402; the resource search server 402 is used for acquiring a search response client 403 corresponding to the search initiating client 401 from the corresponding relation server 404, searching multiple resource index servers 405 according to the search request, and returning the resource feature information index which is searched out to the search initiating client 401; the search response client 404 is used for reporting the resource feature information index of local resource to the resource index server 405 corresponding to the search response client 404; the resource index server 405 is used for storing the resource feature information index reported by the search response client 404 corresponding to the resource index server 405; the corresponding relation server 403 is used for providing the search response client 404 corresponding to the search initiating client 401 to the resource<br><br>
search server 402. The search initiating client 401 is connected to the resource search server 402; the resource search server 402 is connected to various resource index servers 405; each resource index server is connected to the search response client 404 corresponding to resource index server; the corresponding relation server 403 is further connected to the resource search server 402.<br>
When the search initiating client 401 and the search response client 404 are instant messaging clients, the corresponding relation server 403 may be an instant messaging server; the corresponding relation may be modified in the instant messaging server. The establishment and modification of the corresponding relation is obvious to the skilled in field of the instant messaging technology.<br>
Herein, a resource index server may be allocated to a search response client according to the geographic location of the search response client. For example, the same resource index server is allocated to the search response clients with adjacent IP addresses, or the same resource index server is allocated to the search response clients with adjacent geographic locations, or the same resource index server is allocated to the search response clients with IDs in the same zone. Alternatively, a resource index server may also be allocated to a search response client according to the attribute of the search response client. For example, a resource index server may be allocated to a search response client according to an occupation relation, a friend relation, a family relation and a geographic relation. For example, a specific resource index server may be allocated to all search response clients who are teachers or workers.<br>
The above example for allocating a resource index server to a search response client is not used for limiting the present invention obviously.<br>
When there are many search initiating clients, multiple resource search servers should be provided to guarantee the search speed. A resource search server may be allocated to a search response client according to the geographic location of the search initiating client. For example, the same resource search server is allocated to the search initiating clients with adjacent IP addresses, or the same resource index server is allocated to the search response clients with adjacent geographic locations, or the same resource search server is allocated to the search initiating client with IDs in the same zone.<br><br>
Alternatively, a resource search server may also be allocated to a search initiating client according to the attribute of the search initiating client. For example, a resource search server may be allocated to the search initiating client according to an occupation relation, a friend relation, a family relation and a geographic relation. For example, a specific resource index server may be allocated to all search initiating clients who are teachers or workers.<br>
The above example for allocating a resource search server to a search initiating client is not used for limiting the present invention obviously.<br>
The search initiating client corresponds to search response clients of multiple levels and there is a corresponding relation between levels.<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating search response clients of multiple levels in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The corresponding relation between the search initiating client and the first level search response client is a friend relation; the first level search response client includes First level search response clients A and B; First level search response client A may be further connected to Second level search response clients C and D and First level search response client B may be further connected to Second level search response clients E and F. The corresponding relation between Second level search response clients C and D and First level search response client A is a colleague relation while the corresponding relation between Second level search response clients E and F and First level search response client B is a family relation.<br>
The above-mentioned search initiating client corresponds to two level search response clients; however, the level number of the search response clients is not limited in the present invention. Obviously, the bigger the level number is, the wider the network that may be searched is, and the higher the possibility of acquiring the network resource is. Likewise, the corresponding relation between search response clients of various levels is not limited in the present invention*<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart illustrating a method for network search in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this method, the corresponding relation between a search initiating client and a search response client is preset and the search<br><br>
response client sends the feature information index of local resource to the resource index server. As shown in Figure 6, the method includes the processes as follows.<br>
Block 601: A search initiating client initiates a search request to a resource search server; the resource search server acquires a search response client corresponding to the search initiating client from a corresponding relation server.<br>
For example, there are at least two resource index servers and at least two resource search servers, which may meet the search requirement in the case that there are many search initiating clients and search response clients. Moreover, a resource search server may be allocated to a search initiating client according to the geographic location or the attribute of the search initiating client. Likewise, a resource index server may be allocated a search response client according to the geographic location or the attribute of the search response client.<br>
Block 602: The resource search server searches the resource index server according to the search request, and returns the resource feature information index which is searched out to the search initiating client.<br>
For example, the resource search server searches the resource index server according to the search request to find resource feature information corresponding to the search request. In general, the keyword search method may be used. In addition, the search initiating client corresponds to search response clients of multiple levels, and there is a corresponding relation between various levels. The corresponding relation may include at least one of a friend relation, a colleague relation, a stranger relation and a family relation.<br>
Block 603: The search initiating client acquires network resource according to the resource feature information index returned by the resource search server.<br>
Herein, the resource feature information index acquired by the search initiating client indicates the method for acquiring network resource. For example, the resource feature information index may include an IP address and port number of the network resource, so that the search initiating client may directly acquire the network resource according to the IP address and port number.<br>
In addition, when the search initiating client and the search response client are<br><br>
instant messaging clients, the corresponding relation server may be an instant messaging server; the resource feature information index may further include the ID of an instant messaging client having the network resource; therefore, the search initiating client may acquire the network resource according to the ID via a file transmitting channel provided by the instant messaging server.<br>
In the above processes, the corresponding relation between the search initiating client and the search response client may include at least one of a friend relation, a colleague relation, a stranger relation and a family relation.<br>
In addition, the method for the search response client sending the feature information index of the local resource to the resource index server may include: the search response client sends the resource feature information index of local resource to the resource index server periodically; alternatively, the search response client sends the resource feature information index of newly-generated network resource to the resource index server when the search response client generates the new local network resource.<br>
The foregoing description is only preferred embodiments of the present invention and is not for use in limiting the protection scope thereof. Any modification, equivalent replacement and improvement made under the spirit and principle of the present invention should be included in the protection scope thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
