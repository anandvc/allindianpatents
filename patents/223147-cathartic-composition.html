				<td>DESCRIPTION CATHARTIC COMPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The   present   invention    relates   to   a   novel   cathartic composition   which   is   useful   for   relieving   or   preventing constipation   in   a  human  constipated   patient,   and   also  for cleansing a bowel. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prostaglandins (hereinafter referred to as PGs) is the name of the group of fatty acids which possess various physiological activities and contained in human and animal tissues and organs. PGs basically contain the prostanoic acid skeleton of the following formula:<br><br>
and some synthetic products may contain the above skeleton with some modification. PGs are classified into several types according to the structure and substituents on the five-membered ring, for example,<br><br><br>
and the like. Further, they are classified into PGiS containing a 13,14-double bond; PGjS containing, 5,6- and 13,14-double bonds; and PG3S containing 5.6-, 13, 14- and 17,18-double bonds,<br>
PGs  are  expressed  as  follows.     In   PGs,  the  carbons<br><br>
constituting an a-chain. an co-chain and a five-mem be red ring are numbered according to the basic skeleton as follows:<br><br>
That is, in the basic skeleton, the constituent carbon atoms are numbered in such a way that the carbon atom in the carboxyl group is C-1, and the a-chain contains C-2 -C-7, the number increasing toward the ring, the five-membered ring contains C-8 - C-12, and the co-chain contains C-13 - C-20. When the carbons of a-chain are fewer, the numbers of the carbon atoms ensuing C-2 should be properly shifted, and when more than 7, the compound is named provided that carbon at the C-2 position has substituent instead of carboxyl group (at the C-1 position). When the co-chain contains fewer carbon atoms they should be numbered correspondingly smaller than 20, and when more than 8, the carbon atoms at the 21 position and thereafter should be regarded as a substituent. As configuration, it is considered according to that of the above essential skeleton unless otherwise described.<br>
For example, PGD, PGE and PGF mean compounds having hydroxyl group at the C-9 and/or C-11 positions. In the present invention,  PGs also include those having other<br><br>
group instead of the hydroxyl group on the C-9 and/or C-11 positions, they being named as 9-dehydroxy-9-substituted or 11-dehydroxy-11-substituted compounds.<br>
In addition, PGs may include the isomers, such as bi-cyclic tautomers, optical isomers; geometrical isomers, or the like.<br>
PGs are known to have various pharmacological and physiological activities, for example, vasodilation, inducing of inflammation, platelet aggregation, stimulating uterine muscle, stimulating intestinal muscle, anti-ulcer effect and the like. PGEs or PGFs are found to possess contraction of intestines caused by intestinal stimulation is great, while enteropooling effect is poor. Accordingly, it is impossible to use PGEs or PGFs as cathartics because of side effects such as stomachache caused by the intestinal contraction.<br>
On the other hand, PGs having a 13,14-single bond<br>
and a C-15 constituting carbonyi group, and those having a<br>
13,14-double bond and a C-15 constituting carbonyi group<br>
are found to exist in human or animal metabolites. These<br>
13,14-dihydro-1 5-keto-prostag land ins	and	15-keto-<br>
prostaglandins (hereinafter referred to as 15-keto-PGs) are known to be naturally produced metabolites by enzymatic metabolism of the corresponding PGs in vivo. These 15-keto-PGs have been reported to hardly exhibit various physiological      activities     that      PGs      possess      and      be<br><br>
pharmacologically  and   physiologically  inactive   metabolites [see, Acta Physiologica Scandinavica, 66, p.509- (1966)].<br>
U.S.  5,317032  to  Ueno  et al.  describes  prostaglandin cathartics,   including   the  existence   of  bi-cyclic  tautomers However,    the    pronounced    activity    as    anti-constipation treatment and  prevention agents of the bi-cyclic tautomers has not been heretofore known. Disclosure of Invention<br>
While estimating the pharmacological activities of the analogues of 15-keto-PGs, however, the present inventors have found that the corresponding bi-cyclic compounds, i.e., the bi-cyclic tautomers, substituted by one or more halogen atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. At the C-16 position, especially, fluorine atoms, can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. Where desired, larger doses to cause strong cathartic effect can be employed, although the primary purpose of the present invention is to restore a normal number of bowel movements (3 to 7 per week).<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a cathartic composition, which is useful for treatment of constipation as well as cleansing a bowel, without causing substantive side effects such as stomachache.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a cathartic composition,     comprising     a     cathartic-inducing     effective<br><br>
lount of a bi-cyclic compound represented by formula (I);<br><br>
R3 and R4 are hydrogen or one of them is OH;<br>
X^ and X2 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or halogen, and at last one of them is a halogen;<br>
Z is a carbon, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen;<br>
R2 is a hydrogen or alkyl;<br>
Y is a saturated or unsaturated C2.10 hydrocarbon hain which is unsubstituted or substituted by an 0x0, alogen, alkyl, hydroxy!, aryl or heterocyclic group;<br>
A is -CH2OH, -COCH2OH. -COOH or its functional erivative; and<br>
Ri is a saturated or unsaturated, lower hydrocarbon orming a straight-chain or a branched-chain, which is nsubstituted or substituted by halogen, 0x0, hydroxy, ower alkoxy, lower alkanoyloxy, lower cycloalkyi, lower ;ycloalkyloxy,      aryl,      aryloxy,      heterocyclic     group,      or<br><br>
heterocyclic-oxy        group;	lower        cycloalkyl;	lower<br>
cycloalkyloxy;      aryl,      aryloxy,      heterocyclic      group      or heterocyclic-oxy group;<br>
a bond between C-13 and C-14 position is a double or single bond, and<br>
C-15 has a steric configuration of R, S, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The present invention also provide use of a compound of formula (I) for manufacturing a cathartic composition.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for providing a cathartic effect to a patient in need thereof which comprises administering the compound of formula (I)<br>
While the bi-cyclic halogenated compound of formula (I) provides an excellent cathartic effect, said compound does not induce substantive side effects such as stomachache caused by intestinal contraction. Accordingly, the composition of the present invention may be used not only for treatment of chronic or intermittent constipation, but also for treatment or prevention of constipation (as well as to effect loose bowels when desired) in the patients suffering from constipation associated with, for example, hernia or cardiovascular system disease, in order not to strain at stool, or suffering from proctogenic diseases Moreover, the composition may be used to produce normal bowel movements for washing out harmful substances from<br><br>
intestine in case of drug or food poisoning. Additionally, the bi"Cyclic halogen at ed compounds of the present invention may be used as a bowel cleansing agent used for preparation of the bowel prior to preventative, diagnostic or surgical procedures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a cathartic composition comprising a cathartic effective amount of a bi-cyclic compound of formula (I).<br>
Cathartics work by the combination of one or more of the four mechanisms shown below, thereby increasing water content of feces and promoting transfer of the content in the intestines:<br>
(i) Water and electrolytes may be kept in intestines owing to the hydrophilicity or osmotic pressure of the drug, thereby the intraintestinal content increased in volume which indirectly results in faster transfer thereof.<br>
(ii) The drug may work on the intestinal mucosa to reduce total amount of normal absorption of electrolytes and water and increase the amount of water, indirectly resulting in faster transfer of the intraintestinal content.<br>
(iii) The drug may work on the intestinal mucosa to increase total amount of normal secretion of electrolytes and water and increase the amount of water, directly and/or indirectly  resulting   in  faster transfer  of the   intraintestinal<br><br>
content.<br>
(iv) The drug firstly works on intestinal movement to fasten transfer, indirectly resulting in reduced net absorption of water and electrolytes because the time for them to be absorbed is reduced.<br>
The enteropooling test employed in the present<br>
invention is intended to investigate mainly on the action (ii)<br>
and/or (iii), which assesses the effect of the drug on the<br>
intraintestinal water pool by measuring the volume of the<br>
intra intestinal	content.	The	bi-cyclic-halogenated<br>
compounds of the present invention may show extremely great enteropooling effect. However, they hardly or slightly cause contraction of intestines which is one of indexes for assessment of the action (iv). Accordingly, the bi-cyclic haiogenated compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are considered to alleviate constipation by mainly acting on intestinal mucosa directly or indirectly to affect transfer of electrolytes and water from intestinal walls into blood vessels and/or from blood vessels into intestines, resulting in reduced water absorption and/or in increased water secretion through the intestines, increased intraintestinal water pool and promoted transfer of the intraintestinal content.<br>
In the definitions of formula (I), the term "unsaturated is  intended  to   include  at  least one  or  more  double  bonds<br><br>

It has been discovered that in the absence of water, compounds represented by Formula (I) exist predominantly in the form of the bi-cyclic compound. In aqueous media, it is believed that hydrogen bonding occurs between, for example, the ketone position at the C-15 position, thereby hindering bi-cyclic ring formation. In addition, it is believed that the halogen atom(s) at the C-16 position promote bi-cyclic ring formation. The mono-cyclic/bi-cyclic structures, for example, may be present in a ratio of 1 : 6 in D2O; 1  : 10 in CD3OD-D2O and 4 : 96 in CDCI3.   Accordingly,<br><br>
a preferable embodiment of the present invention is the composition in which the bi-cyclic form is present in ratio of bi -cyclic/mono-cyclic of least 1:1, and preferably 20 : 1, or even greater to substantially all bi-cyclic compound; 100 % bi-cyclic compound is within the scope of this invention.<br>
