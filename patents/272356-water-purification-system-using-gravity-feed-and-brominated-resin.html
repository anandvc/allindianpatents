COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION -10)<br>
WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM USING GRAVITY FEED AND BROMINATED RESIN<br>
BAJAJ ELECTRICALS LIMITED, a company registered in India having its registered office at 45/47, Veer Nariman Road, Mumbai - 400 001. India<br>
An Indian Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to Non powered, storage type water purifier and in particular gravity feed water purification system which uses brominated resin to purify drinking water by removing there from physical, organic chemical and microbiological contaminants.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Gravity filtration is an age old method for water purification which is known to effectively remove physical impurities from water. However filtration is known to be very slow. Under the prior art, ceramic filters are also very effectively used in a filtration system for getting water free from physical impurities. However one of the major drawbacks found while using ceramic filters in a purification system is that impurities like organic chemical contaminants and other microorganisms are not effectively removed using this method.<br>
Activated carbon has been used for water purification for it removes organic chemicals, colour, smell, dissolved gases from water and amongst other things chlorine. Most municipal organizations including in India use chlorine for purification of large volume of water before distribution. Iodine was also experimented with; however it failed owing to its residual effect<br>
 <br>
which imparts colour, taste and fishy smell in water after purification. However both chlorine and iodine based water purification systems need contact time so as to deactivate microorganisms. The released chlorine or iodine remains in the purified water and thus needs to be removed in order to avoid the purified water from emanating a smell, taste and colour.<br>
Object of invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to obviate the aforesaid drawbacks in the prior art.<br>
It is one of the main objects of the invention to reduce the remains of halogen from the purified water m order to avoid the purified water from emanating a smell, taste and colour.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a gravity feed water purification system comprising of a top filtration unit having (i) a sediment filter at its top, (ii) inner cage sediment filter and (iii) dome-shaped carbon filter and a bottom purification unit having (i) a resin chamber housed in a chamber defined by a porous barrier mesh at its top and bottom; with the carbon filter in direct fluid contact with the resin chamber which enables a controlled flow rate of water for purification into the resin chamber. The filtered water which leaves    the    resin    chamber,    housed    within    the    bottom<br>
 <br>
purification unit, has no chemical concentration and is purified water of a superior quality free from harmful pathogenic water borne bacteria and virus.<br>
The object of this invention is to effectively combine a top chamber filtration unit with a bottom chamber purification unit through the use of a sediment filter at the top housing an inner cage sediment filter and a dome-shaped carbon block filter in direct fluid contact with the resin chamber. Water flowing in from the lid of the top container into first the sediment filter gets rid of the sediments in the water, then flows into the inner cage sediment filter where physical impurities get removed, then flows into the carbon block filter where it is bereft of organic impurities and then this water, free from physical and organic impurities, flows into the brominated resin chamber which rids it of bacteria and virus and the water which ultimately flows out of the bottom chamber through the spout is pure, odourless superior quality water.<br>
The present invention will be more readily appreciated in a reading of the "Detailed Description of the Invention" with reference to the drawings.<br>
Brief description of drawings:<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the non limiting figure in the accompanying drawing, in which<br>
 <br>
FIG.     A     shows     perspective     view     of    the     invention<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
This gravity feed water purification system under the present invention typically consists of a top chamber called its filtration unit which is covered with a top lid, middle ring separating the top chamber from the bottom purification unit housing bromine resin in a chamber defined at its top and bottom by a porous barrier mesh, with the bottom purification unit resting on firm flat surface leading to a spout through which purified water from the bottom chamber is ultimately dispensed for the purposes of drinking.<br>
This invention consists of a carbon block filter placed at the bottom of the top filtration unit whereby filtered water directly passes through the base of the carbon block and into the resin chamber through an annular passage.<br>
The process of water purification under by the present invention is illustrated in figure A.<br>
As illustrated in fig. A, the embodiment of this inventive system typically comprises of a top filtration unit (1) and a bottom purification unit (2) interconnected by an annular passage through the middle ring (3), with the bottom purification unit resting on a firm flat surface leading to a spout (4) through<br>
 <br>
which purified water from the bottom chamber is ultimately dispensed for drinking. The top filtration unit (1) comprises of a sediment filter (1A) placed at the top of the filtration unit. Just beneath this sediment filter (1A) is placed an inner cage sediment filter (IB) made up of synthetic woven cloth which acts as a pre-filter, is placed as an inverted hat-shaped structure and it surrounds the innermost carbon block filter (ID) without touching it. This inner cage sediment filter (IB) has an outer cover (1C) with deep holes which make the inner cage sediment filter to be visible.<br>
The bottom purification unit consists of a resin chamber (2A) consisting of halogenated bromine resin located in a chamber defined at its top and bottom with a porous barrier mesh. The upper filtration unit (1) leads into and is connected to the bottom purification unit (2) through an annular passage of a specified diaphragm which allows water to flow in a controlled manner. Both the top filtration system (1) and the bottom purification system (&amp;) are air tight and are separated by a middle ring (3).<br>
The sediment filter (1A) present at the top of the filtration unit (1) of the system is used to remove the sediments in the water. The inverted hat-shaped inner cage sediment filter (IB) is used to remove the physical impurities like dust, dirt, mud, silt etc. in the water. This inner cage sediment filter (IB) is washable. The carbon block filter (ID) which consists of active carbon removes the organic impurities like free chlorine, foul smell,<br>
 <br>
bad colour, dissolved gases etc. in the water by adsorption mechanism and finally the brominated resin chamber (2A) which consists of specially designed brominated resin beads which rids the water of any harmful chemicals, bacteria and virus.<br>
The operation and working principle of the system according to the invention is as follows :<br>
Water is poured from the lid into the top filtration unit of the system where it passes through the sediment filter (1A) present at the top of the filtration unit, it then passes through the inverted hat-shaped inner cage sediment filter (IB) into first the space which divides the inner cage from the carbon block filter and then into the carbon block filter (ID), from the carbon block filter water then flows into the annular passage located in the centre of the middle ring (3) which has a specified diaphragm for water to flow there from and into the brominated resin chamber (SA) from where the filtered and purified water flows to the bottom of the bottom purification unit (2) and into the spout (4) through which purified water from the bottom chamber is ultimately dispensed for drinking.<br>
When water flows through the annular passage into the brominated resin chamber with an average flow rate of 4 litres per hour or less, the water borne disease causing bacteria and viruses get in contact with this special bromine based contact biocide   and   this   bromine   get   released   in   the   water   and<br>
 <br>
inactivates the water borne disease causing bacteria and viruses thus purifying the water and making it safe for human consumption. A small amount of bromine remains in the water after inactivating water borne disease causing bacteria and viruses. This residual bromine will control external microbial contamination during storage thus increasing the shelf life of purified water.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A)	In the case of this Brominated resin system, as explained<br>
these binding sites are chemicalry modified to COVELENTLY bind bromine to the bead, and the bromine leaves      once      it      contacts      a      virus      or      bacteria.<br>
This also engineers a small residual amount of bromine to allow for a trace residual of bromine in the water, which is very important to allow for additional killing power in the storage vessel.<br>
Temperature or ph conditions do not affect the amount of bromine released by the beads.<br>
B)	In the case of iodine/chlorine leaching technologies, the<br>
iodine is bound to the surface with a relatively weak ionic bond.<br>
Vast quantities of iodine can be leached, and temperature and<br>
 <br>
pH of the water can greatly influence the rate of leaching. This<br>
has	serious	taste,	odor	and<br>
health repercussions.<br>
C) Also, the taste/odour of Iodine and Chlorine can be detected in water much faster/easier than Bromine because of much lower threshold limits of taste for these halogens.<br>
When we have described and illustrated particular embodiment of our present invention we do not wish to limit ourselves to the exact form shown which is indeed to illustrate our invention rather than to limit to it.<br>
It is to be expressly understood that the invention is susceptible to such improvements and modifications, which may be made by any person skilled in the art to suit individual job requirement and any such improvements and modifications so made in the seal here in before described and illustrated shall be considered to be falling within the ambit and scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br>
