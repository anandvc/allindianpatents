 The   present   invention   relates    to    substituted    1 -piperazinylacylpipendine derivatives, their preparation and their therapeutic application.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention exhibit affinity for the neurotropbin receptor p75NTR.<br>
Neurotrophins belong to a family of proteins which possess a similar structure and similar functions and include nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) and neurotrophin-6 (NT-6). The biological effects of these proteins (survival and differentiation) are exerted through interaction with membrane receptors having tyrosine kinase activity (trk-A, trk-B and trk-C) (H. THOENEN, Science, 1995, 270, 593-598; G.R. LEWIN and Y.A. BARDE, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 1996, 19, 289-317; M.V. CHAO, J., Neurobiol., 1994, 25, 1373-1385; M. BOTHWELL, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 1995, 18, 223-253; G. DECHANT and Y.A. BARDE, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 1997, 7, 413-418). However, many studies show the preponderant role of the p75NTR receptor in the activity of neurotrophins.<br>
The p75NTR receptor, the receptor for all neurotrophins. is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family (WJ. FRIEDMAN and L.A. GREENE, Exp. Cell. Res., 1999, 253, 131-142; J. MELDOSIS et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 2000, 21, 242-243). A number of biological functions are attributed to the p75NTR receptor: on the one hand, the modulation of the affinity of neurotrophins for trk receptors; on the other hand, in the absence of trk, induction of a signal for cell death by apoptosis which occurs through homodimerization of the receptor and activation of the ceramide pathway.<br>
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiological mechanism for elimination of cells in numerous tissues. In particular, apoptosis plays a preponderant role in embryogenesis, morphogenesis and cell renewal. Apoptosis is a genetically controlled phenomenon which only occurs at an advanced and irreversible stage of cell lesion.<br>
Many studies show that apoptosis occurs in several pathologies of the central nervous system such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and prion diseases. Furthermore, neuronal death through apoptosis also occurs very early after cerebral and cardiac ischaemia.<br><br>
2<br>
Cell death is also a preponderant phenomenon in atherosclerosis; indeed, the necrosis zones in primary atherosclerotic lesions in humans are evaluated at 80% (ML. BOCHATON-PIALAT et al., Am. J. Pathol., 1995, 146, 1-6; H. PERLMAN, Circulation, 1997, 95, 981-987). Apoptosis is also involved in mechanisms leading to cell death following cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion (H. YAOITA et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 2000,45, 630-641).<br>
Several studies show that the p75NTR-dependent pro-apoptotic signal is observed in various cell types including neuronal cells, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells and also hepatic, cardiac and smooth muscle cells (J.M. FRADE et al,, Nature, 1996, 383, 166-168; P. LASACCIA-BONNEFIL et al., Nature, 1996, 383, 716-719; M. SOILU-HANNINEN et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 4828-4838; N. TRIM et al., Am. J. Pathol., 2000, 156, 1235-1243; S.Y. WANG et al., Am. J. Pathol., 2000, 157, 1247-1258). Moreover, a number of experiments carried out in vivo show an increase in the expression of p75NTR following ischaemia in regions of the brain and of the heart in which massive apoptosis is recorded. These results therefore suggest that p75NTR may play a preponderant role in the mechanisms leading to neuronal death through apoptosis post ischaemia (P.P. ROUX et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 6887-6896; J.A. PARK et al., J. Neurosci., 2000, 20, 9096-9103).<br>
The p75 receptor is described as a cellular target for the prion peptide (V. DELLA-BIANCA et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, in press) and for the p-amyloid peptide (S. RABIZADEH et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1994, 91 10703-10706) and would thus be involved in apoptotic phenomena induced by these compounds. These results support the hypothesis according to which p75NTR would play an important role in neuronal death induced by the infectious prion protein (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) or by the beta-amyloid protein (Alzheimer's disease).<br>
Recent studies suggest that the p75NTR receptor might also play an important role in axonal regeneration, via its function as co-receptor for the Nogo receptor (WONG et al., Nature Neurosci., 2002, 5, 1302-1308; Kerracher and Winton, Neuron, 2002, 36, 345-348). Indeed, several myelin-associated proteins (myelin-associated glycoprotein, MAG, Nogo-A and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein OMgp) inhibit nerve regeneration at the central level during medullary or cranial trauma. These proteins are located in the membrane of the oligodendrocytes directly adjacent to the axon and inhibit neuritic growth by binding with a high affinity to the Nogo receptor located on the axonal membrane. The p75NTR receptor is associated with the Nogo receptor and is involved in the signalling of the inhibitory effects of these myelin proteins in relation to axonal growth. As a result, the p75NTR receptor plays a major<br><br>
3<br>
role in the regulation of neuronal plasticity and in neuron-glia interactions and represents a therapeutic target of choice for promoting nerve regeneration.<br>
At the peripheral level, recent studies show an increase in the expression of p75 and of neurotrophins and a massive apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, a pro-angiogenic and vasodilative effect of NGF is also recorded. Finally, a novel form of p75 which is truncated in the extracellular part has been identified as well as its major role in established vasculogenesis (D. VON SHACK et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2001, 4, 977-978). All these recent data suggest that p75NTR in its whole or truncated form could also play a preponderant role in vascular pathologies.<br>
A number of compounds are known to interact with the trkA/NGF/p75NTR system or to possess an NGF-type activity. Thus, patent application WO 00/59893 describes substituted pyrimidine derivatives which demonstrate an NGF-type activity and/or which increase the activity of NGF on PC 12 cells. Patent applications WO 00/69828 and WO 00/69829 describe polycyclic compounds which inhibit the binding of NGF to the p75 receptor in cells which do not express the trkA receptor. Application WO 94/11373 describes pyridazinoquinazolone derivatives which bind to the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Application WO 94/22866 describes pyrazoloquinazolone derivatives which specifically bind to NGF so as to avoid its attachment to the p75NTR receptor but allowing it to interact with the trk receptor. Application WO 01/49684 describes substituted tetrahydropyridine derivatives which possess activity vis-a-vis the modulation of TNF-alpha.<br>

The compounds according to the invention were subjected to biochemical studies.<br>
Cell culture:<br>
The SH-SY-5Y strain (human neuroblastoma) is cultured conventionally in a DMEM culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) (Gibco BRL, France) containing FCS (5%) (foetal calf serum) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), anti-PPLO (5 ml) (antimycoplasma agent: Tylocine® prepared in a normal saline solution, 6 000 ug/ml), gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) and glutamine (4 mM) in collagen-coated culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, France).<br>
The stock strain SK-N-BE (human neuroblastoma) and the clone Bep 75 expressing the human p75NTR receptor (SK-N-BE Bep 75) are conventionally cultured in a DMEM culture medium containing FCS (5%), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), anti-PPLO (5 ml), gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) and glutamine (4 mM).<br>
Study of the binding of 125I-NGF to the pl5mR receptor<br>
The study of the binding of 125I-NGF (neuronal growth factor radiolabelled with iodine-125) is carried out on a cellular suspension of the two strains SH-SY-5Y and SK-N-BE Bep 75 in accordance with the method described by Weskarnp (Neuron, 1991, 6, 649-663). Nonspecific binding is determined by measuring the total binding after one hour of preincubation with the cells at 37°C in the presence of nonradiolabelled NGF (1 uM). The specific binding is calculated by the difference<br><br>
67<br>
between the measurement of total binding and the measurement of nonspecific binding. The competition experiments are carried out using a 125I-NGF concentration of 0.3 nM. The concentrations inhibiting by 50% (IC50) the binding of 125I-NGF to the p75NTR receptor of the compounds according to the invention are low and vary from 10"6tol0"nM.<br>
Measurement of apoptosis:<br>
The cells (human neuroblastoma strains SH-SY-5Y and SK-N-BE Bep 75) are established in Petri dishes 35 mm in diameter (Biocoat collagen I) (105 cells/well) in a DMEM culture medium containing 5% FCS for 24 h. The culture medium is then removed, the cells are rinsed with PBS (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline) and either fresh medium containing 5% FCS or medium containing NGF at the concentration of lOng/ml is added in the presence or absence of the compounds according to the invention. The levels of apoptosis are measured 48 hours after the treatments in the case of the strain SH-SY-5Y and 24 hours later in the case of the strain SK-N-BE Bep 75 by quantifying the cytoplasmic histones associated with the DNA fragments (cell death detection ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). The levels of apoptosis are expressed as quantity of oligonucleosomes/105 cells ± SD. Each value corresponds to the mean of 9 experimental points distributed over 3 independent experiments. The compounds of formula (I) exhibit NGF-induced apoptosis inhibitory activity with IC50 values varying from 10"6 to 10*11 M.<br>
Thus the binding of the compounds according to the invention to the p75 receptor results, on the one hand, at the biochemical level, in the inhibition of the dimerization of the receptor induced by neurotrophins, and, on the other hand, at the cellular level, in the inhibition of the proapoptotic effect mediated by the p75NTR receptor.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can therefore be used for the preparation of medicaments, in particular of medicaments intended for the prevention or treatment of any pathology where the p75      receptor is involved.<br>
Thus, in another of its aspects, the invention provides medicaments comprising a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, or alternatively a solvate or a hydrate of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Thus the compounds according to the invention may be used, in humans or in animals, in the treatment or prevention of various p75NTR-dependent conditions such as central and peripheral neurodegenerative diseases such as senile dementia, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntingdon's chorea, Down's syndrome, prion  diseases,   amnesia,   schizophrenia;   amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis,  multiple<br><br>
