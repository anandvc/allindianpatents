				<td>The present invention relates to a method for<br>
evaluating the filling ratio of a tubular rotary mill<br>
comprising a cylindrical barrel rotating around its<br>
longitudinal axis, the contents of which consist of a load<br>
of grinding medium made of metallic alloy and of material<br>
to be crushed which forms the pulp inside the mill as and<br>
when it is crushed, and essentially occupies, during the<br>
rotation of the mill and viewed in the rotation direction,<br>
the fourth trigonometric quarter of the section of the<br>
mill, while the bottom of the contents extends into the<br>
third trigonometric quarter and the top is raised into the<br>
first trigonometric quarter. The invention also relates to<br>
a device to be advantageously used for the implementation<br>
of this method.<br>
The invention essentially aims at mills of the ball<br>
or rod mill type, in particular used for crushing clinker<br>
or for crushing coal and minerals.<br>
To know the filling ratio of a mill is especially<br>
important for optimum operation of mining mills working in<br>
a wet process since the wear on the grinding medium is very<br>
heavy there and grinding medium has to be almost constantly<br>
supplied. This entails that the quantity of the medium<br>
still present in the mill should be known at any moment and<br>
that, consequently, a means for separately measuring the<br>
quantity of grinding medium and the quantity of pulp<br>
contained in the mill should be available.<br>
It has been noted that optimum crushing conditions<br>
are obtained when the volume of the pulp approximately<br>
corresponds to the volume of the spaces between the pieces<br>
of grinding medium or slightly higher than this volume,<br>
without however exceeding it by more than 20%. When the<br>
volume of the pulp is too low, the crushing output is<br>
reduced and, in particular, the pieces of grinding medium<br>
that are in contact with each other mutually wear down.<br>
When the volume of pulp is too high, the crushing output is<br>
also reduced. To know the quantity of pulp in the mill<br>
therefore allows to adjust the supply of the mill in the<br>
most appropriate manner that corresponds to the optimum<br>
operation of the mill.<br>
Among the many techniques currently known for<br>
determining the filling ratio of a mill in operation, none<br>
of them is completely satisfactory since they are generally<br>
either too imprecise or incomplete.<br>
A first method consists in measuring the evolution<br>
in the power absorbed by the mill. This power absorbed by<br>
the mill increases with the filling ratio and reaches a<br>
maximum after which it starts to decrease, in particular<br>
because of the reduced effect of unbalance. The power curve<br>
shows a very flat maximum, which considerably reduces the<br>
sensitivity of measurement as soon as the maximum is<br>
approached. Such a method is described in "Canadian Mineral<br>
Processors" Proceedings 1998, paper no. 24, Ottawa,<br>
Ontario.<br>
A second method consists in measuring the forces<br>
exerted on the plating. An instrumented plate is placed<br>
within the plating and when it enters the load, the force<br>
exerted on the plate suddenly rises and decreases when the<br>
plate comes out of the load. This measurement is only<br>
applicable to mills provided with rubber plating and is<br>
very sensitive to the wear of the instrumented plate. Such<br>
a method is described in patent WO 93/00996.<br>
Another method consists in measuring the<br>
deformation of the barrel of the mill given that it is<br>
subjected to radial and transverse deformations that<br>
increase as the mill is filled. The sensitivity of this<br>
measurement is reduced in the case of a low L/D ratio<br>
(length of the mill relative to its diameter) and by any<br>
rigidifying element such as an intermediate partition or<br>
great thickness of the barrel or of the plating. The<br>
principle of this measurement is described in the article<br>
"Measurement System of the Mill Charge in Grinding Ball<br>
Mill Circuits" by J. Kolacz-Mineral Engineering, Vol 10,<br>
No. 12, 1997 pp 1329-1338.<br>
The installation of balances has also been<br>
considered in order to be able to take a direct measurement<br>
of the weight of the mill. However, this installation is<br>
quite difficult with existing mills.<br>
Another method consists in measuring the noise<br>
generated by the impacts between the grinding medium and<br>
the plating of the mill. This noise increases with the<br>
filling ratio of grinding medium but, because the material<br>
to be crushed deadens the impacts, the noise decreases when<br>
the filling with material increases, hence the inaccuracy<br>
of measurement. In order to take these measurements,<br>
microphones have been used and placed near the barrel of<br>
the mill in order to detect the noises. This method is<br>
however affected by external noises (neighbouring mills in<br>
the crushing room) as well as by other factors such as the<br>
nature of the crushed material, the form of the grinding<br>
medium and the wear of the plating. Such a method is<br>
described in the article "New acoustic method for measuring<br>
the filling ratio of mill feed in tube mills" by F. Godler<br>
and J. Hagenbach, Zement-Kalk-Gyps No. 4/1994, pp E 114-<br>
E 119.<br>
The German patent DE19933995A1 attempts to remedy<br>
the interference of the various noises by replacing the<br>
microphones with ultrasound sensors fixed to the barrel.<br>
These sensors measure the oscillations of the barrel where<br>
they are attached and not the noises transmitted through<br>
the air, which solves the problem of interfering noises.<br>
Moreover, all the above-described methods have the<br>
drawback that they do not allow the separate evaluation of<br>
the filling ratio in grinding medium and the filling ratio<br>
of pulp or material to be crushed.<br>
Measurement by wave absorption does in fact allow<br>
to distinguish the material to be crushed from the balls<br>
but it is not applicable to all types of material and<br>
presents a health risk because of X or gamma rays.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a<br>
new method and device allowing a reliable evaluation of the<br>
filling ratio that can easily be implemented on an existing<br>
mill and which can separately provide information on the<br>
grinding medium and on the pulp.<br>
In order to achieve this objective, the present<br>
invention proposes a method of the kind described in the<br>
preamble, which is characterised in that an algorithm is<br>
established by means of a model and defines a relationship<br>
between the filling ratio of a mill on the one hand, and<br>
the angular positions of the bottom and top of the mill<br>
contents, as well as of its power absorbed on the other<br>
hand, in that the angular positions of the bottom and top<br>
of the contents are measured in the mill for which the<br>
filling ratio is to be determined, as well as its power<br>
absorbed, and in that the filling ratio of the mill is<br>
determined by means of these measurements and of the<br>
algorithm.<br>
These measurements may be taken separately in order<br>
to determine the filling ratio of grinding medium and that<br>
of the pulp.<br>
The angular positions of the bottom and top of the<br>
grinding load are determined by induction, whereas the<br>
angular positions of the bottom and top of the pulp are<br>
determined by conduction.<br>
The device for implementing this method for<br>
evaluating the filling ratio of a mill comprising a barrel<br>
with inner plating is characterised in that the plating<br>
comprises at least one plate made of resin or elastomer,<br>
into which a detection system is integrated in order to<br>
detect the angular position at which the system enters the<br>
mill contents and the angular position at which the system<br>
comes out of the mill contents, in that the barrel<br>
comprises a sensor intended to generate a synchronisation<br>
signal with each turn of the mill, in that the signals<br>
generated by the detection system and the sensor are<br>
handled in an integrated processing device and sent by<br>
radio waves to a processing centre.<br>
The detection device preferably comprises an<br>
inductive sensor for determining the angular positions of<br>
the bottom and top of the grinding load and a conductive<br>
sensor for determining the angular positions of the bottom<br>
and top of the pulp.<br>
All the sensors are preferably duplicated and<br>
buried at different depths in the plates containing them so<br>
as to come into operation successively as and when the<br>
plates wear out.<br>
Other features and characteristics of the invention<br>
will emerge from the detailed description of a preferred<br>
embodiment, presented below by way of illustration with<br>
reference to the attached figures in which:<br>
- Fig. I diagrammatically shows a diametric section through<br>
a mill;<br>
- Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view of a longitudinal section<br>
through a mill provided with the equipment proposed by<br>
the present invention;<br>
- Fig. 3 diagrammatically shows a diametric section through<br>
the mill of Fig. 2;<br>
- Figs. 4 and 5 show an enlarged view in section of the<br>
plates with the sensors;<br>
- Fig. 6 is a view equivalent to that of Fig. 1 showing the<br>
details of the angular positions; and<br>
- Fig. 7 shows a graph representing the correlation between<br>
the calculation according to the present invention and<br>
the actual weight of the grinding medium.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a mill with a grinding load 1 composed<br>
of balls and comprising a certain quantity of material to<br>
be crushed 2, which forms the pulp. The filling of grinding<br>
balls generally corresponds to 20 to 40% of the total<br>
volume of the mill, depending on the operating conditions.<br>
The volume of the pulp for optimum operation of the mill,<br>
as defined in the introduction, approximately corresponds<br>
to the volume of the spaces between the balls or is<br>
slightly higher, without exceeding it by more than 20%.<br>
During the rotation of the mill in the direction of<br>
the arrow on Figure 1, the contents of the mill have the<br>
global shape in cross-section of a "pea pod" and is mainly<br>
concentrated in the fourth trigonometric quarter. The<br>
bottom 3 of the pulp and the bottom 5 of the balls,<br>
however, extend into the third trigonometric quarter,<br>
whereas the top 4 of the pulp and the top 6 of the balls<br>
are raised into the first trigonometric quarter.<br>
Because of the different structures of the load 1<br>
and of the pulp 2, their respective bottoms 5 and 3 and<br>
their respective tops 6 and 4 have different angular<br>
positions. Hence, the grinding load 1 is more raised than<br>
the pulp 2. The present invention, as seen below, takes<br>
advantage of these differences to separately determine the<br>
volume of the load and that of the pulp.<br>
To this end, the invention provides sensors that<br>
release an electric signal at the moment when they enter<br>
the pulp 2 and the load 1 respectively, and another signal<br>
at the moment when they come out of them.<br>
For the pulp, the invention has provided conductive<br>
sensors 7 and 8 by which one measures the current created<br>
by a chemical battery consisting of two masses of steel<br>
with a different composition forming electrodes which,<br>
connected to each other by a conductive medium consisting<br>
of the pulp, are the source of an electric current.<br>
These masses of steel are integrated into a plate 9<br>
of resin or elastomer which, for the ease of access, may be<br>
placed on the mill door.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, a pair of sensors 7<br>
and 8 is provided, shown on Figures 4 and 5 respectively.<br>
As can be seen, these sensors are buried at different<br>
depths in the elastomer plate 9. Hence, when the sensor 7,<br>
8 at the surface on Figure 4 is damaged by wear, the sensor<br>
7, 8 on Figure 5 buried in the plate 9 can take over.<br>
When the mill is rotating, at the moment when the<br>
electrodes 7 and 8 of the sensor enter the pulp, the latter<br>
allows a current to pass between these electrodes, thereby<br>
releasing a signal, the detection of which allows to<br>
determine the angular position of the bottom 3 of the pulp.<br>
In the same way, when the electrodes 7, 8 come out of the<br>
pulp, the current is interrupted and the moment of this<br>
interruption provides information on the angular position<br>
of the top of the pulp 4.<br>
This type of measurement may not be used for the<br>
grinding load 1 because of the discontinuous nature of this<br>
medium. In order to take this measurement, an inductive<br>
sensor 10 known per se will be used and placed in the plate<br>
9 of the door, buried in the mass of the resin. As shown on<br>
Figures 2, 4 and 5, two sensors 10 will also be used here,<br>
buried at different depths in order to be able to continue<br>
with measurements when the sensor at the surface is damaged<br>
by wear.<br>
The operation works in the same way as described<br>
above. When the mill rotates, at the moment when the<br>
inductive sensors 10 enter the load of grinding medium 1,<br>
they detect a modification of the electric field, which in<br>
turn generates a signal, the timing of which allows the<br>
bottom 5 of the load to be located. When the inductive<br>
sensors 10 come out of the load, they detect a new<br>
variation in the electric field, which allows the top 6 of<br>
the load to be located.<br>
In order to be able to determine these angular<br>
positions, a point of reference is required. This is why a<br>
synchronisation signal is generated with every turn of the<br>
mill by a device with cells, for instance photoelectric<br>
cells, provided on the barrel and on a fixed chassis<br>
respectively and allowing to provide a reference for<br>
determining the angular positions. If this signal is the<br>
starting point and if the rotation speed of the barrel is<br>
known, the timings of the generation and end of the<br>
measurement signals provide an indication of the angular<br>
positions of the bottoms 3 and 5 and of the tops 4 and 6<br>
relative to a reference point which may be that of the<br>
position of the synchronisation device.<br>
The signals provided by the sensors are recorded,<br>
filtered and processed by an integrated system 12 fixed to<br>
the barrel which sends them by radio waves to a processing<br>
centre which is not shown. All of these integrated devices<br>
may be supplied by an electric generator 13 fixed to the<br>
barrel or by transmission of energy by induction.<br>
Figure 6 diagrammatically shows the measurements<br>
provided by the sensors 7, 8 and 10. These are the angles<br>
ai of the bottom 3 and 0.2 of the top 4 of the pulp<br>
respectively, as well as the angles pi of the bottom 5 and<br>
P2 of the top 6 respectively of the grinding load. These<br>
angles are measured relative to a reference axis determined<br>
in this case by the synchronisation device.<br>
In order to be able to evaluate the filling ratios<br>
of grinding load and of pulp, mathematical models are<br>
established with the following formulae:<br>
Ji = ai«i + bids + GI k.W. + di<br>
J2 = a2pi + b2p2 + c2 k.W. + d2<br>
where:<br>
- Ji is the volume of the pulp / volume of the mill;<br>
- J2 is the volume of the load / volume of the mill;<br>
- a, b, c, d are parameter coefficients;<br>
- kW is the power absorbed measured by means known per se.<br>
These models, in particular the parameter<br>
coefficients, may be determined by empirical means by<br>
introducing into a model of a mill different known<br>
quantities of grinding load and of pulp and by measuring<br>
each time the angles «i, a2, Pi and p2 as well as the power<br>
absorbed.<br>
Trial runs have shown that the evaluation method<br>
proposed by the invention allows to work with great<br>
accuracy. Figure 7 summarises the results of such trials<br>
for the evaluation of the filling ratio of grinding medium<br>
for crushing minerals.<br>
The load for these trials was composed of balls of<br>
40mm and 25mm diameter. The relative percentage of minerals<br>
to water was maintained constant and the speed of the mill<br>
was 34 revolutions per minute. The filling of balls in the<br>
mill was progressively increased from 700kg to 900kg by<br>
supplies of between 8 and 20kg. The filling of the pulp was<br>
not controlled but it was the result of the changes in the<br>
process and varied between 289 and 443kg.<br>
The straight line on Figure 7 represents the<br>
actual quantities of balls in the mill. The dots represent<br>
the evaluated quantities of balls obtained by means of the<br>
above-mentioned mathematical model and based on the<br>
measurement of the angles aj. and 0.2 as well as on the power<br>
absorbed. These trials have shown that the invention allows<br>
to evaluate the filling ratio in balls with an accuracy of<br>
the order of 98%.<br>
In addition, the measurement of the angular<br>
positions ai and c
on the fluidity of the pulp, i.e. its water content.<br>
Indeed, the higher the fluidity of the pulp, the lower the<br>
pulp is raised, hence the smaller the angle 0(2- This<br>
knowledge also contributes to optimising the operation of<br>
the mill. <br><br>
