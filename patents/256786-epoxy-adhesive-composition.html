Epoxy Adhesive Composition<br>
The present invention relates to an epoxy adhesive composition according to claim 1, the use of an epoxy adhesive composition for bonding parts of a vehicle according to claim 15 and a vehicle according to claim 16.<br>
Epoxy adhesive compositions are reaction adhesive compositions comprising an epoxy resin, a curing agent and usually an accelerator. Upon heat-activation, the epoxy groups of the epoxy resin react with the curing agent linking the epoxy resin compounds by a polyaddition reaction to obtain a cured product.<br>
Such a cured product is known to have good mechanical properties and a corrosion resistance superior to the cured product of other reaction adhesives. These characteristics make epoxy adhesive compositions particularly useful for demanding applications where stringent mechanical requirements must be satisfied, for example in the automotive industry. Adhesives for bonding parts of the body structure of a vehicle, for example a car, a lorry, a bus or a train, are called structural adhesives.<br>
Structural epoxy adhesives based on the technology described in EP-A-0 308 664 and in EP-A-0 353 190 are highly suitable for bonding parts of a vehicle due to the excellent static and dynamic strength of their cured products.<br>
In the manufacturing process of a vehicle, the body-in-white structure to which the structural adhesive has been<br><br>
applied is subjected to spray wash or other cleaning followed by phosphatizing and e-coating prior to the final curing of the structural adhesive in the e-coat oven. In order to prevent the structural adhesive from being washed off, it is conventionally prehardened by thermal methods such as inductive precuring or by using a body-in-white oven.<br>
However, such an additional precuring step makes the manufacturing process laborious. Additionally, body-in-white ovens are very expensive„<br>
To circumvent the prehardening in a body-in-white oven or by induction, one option is to add solid epoxy resins to the structural adhesive composition, thereby providing a structural adhesive having a high basic viscosity. Although such a structural adhesive has a certain wash-off resistance, it is difficult to apply. For its application, a fully heated application equipment is necessary. In particular, its use in high volume applications, which require high application speeds, is limited.<br>
Several structural epoxy adhesives and other curable epoxy resin based compositions are known in the art:<br>
EP-A-0 270 914 relates to a structural adhesive comprising an epoxy-group containing material, a thermoplastic polyester and a curing agent. The problem described in this application is to reduce shrinkage during curing of the structural adhesive.<br>
WO 03/054069 relates to a thermosettable composition comprising a liquid epoxy resin, a thermoplastic polymer powder,  a blowing agent, a curative and a filler. This<br><br>
thermosettable composition foams and cures at a relatively low temperature.<br>
US-A-5,194 ,502 describes a structural epoxy adhesive which comprises a polyester resin having carboxyl groups at its termini. Although the structural adhesive of US-A-■ 5,194,502 has a relatively good wash-off resistance, the dynamic strength after' curing is relatively poor. It does therefore not fully comply with the safety requirements in terms of the crash resistance of a vehicle.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an epoxy adhesive composition, which has a rather low basic viscosity at application temperature and, without being precured, a high wash-off resistance. Said epoxy adhesive composition results in a cured product having a high static and dynamic strength and a good corrosion 'resistance.<br>
The epoxy adhesive composition of the present invention comprises<br>
a)	a first epoxy resin,<br>
b)	a second epoxy resin modified with a copolymer<br>
based on a 1,3-diene and a polar, ethylenically<br>
unsaturated comonoruer,<br>
c)	a toughener selected from the group consisting of<br>
compounds of formula I<br><br><br>
wherein m is 1 or 2, n is 2 to 6, R1 is an n-valent radical of an elastomeric prepolymer after the removal of the terminal isocyanate, amino or hydroxyl group, the elastomeric prepolymer being soluble or dispersible in epoxy resin, W and X are independently -0- or -NR3-, at least one of W and X being -NR3-, R2 is an m+1-valent radical of a polyphenol or aminophenol after the removal of the phenolic hydroxyl group and optionally of the amino group, and R3 is hydrogen, a Ci to Ce  alkyl or phenol,<br>
and compounds of formula II<br><br>
wherein p is 1 or 2, q is 2 to 6, Y is -0-, -S- or -NR6-, Z is a radical selected from the group consisting of -OH, -NHR6, -OCN,<br><br><br>
RA is a residue of a hydroxyl-, mercapto- or amino -terminated polyether prepolymer or of a hydroxyl-, mercapto- or amino-terminated prepolymeric, segmented polyester, polythioester or polyamid, R5 is a carbocyclic aromatic or araiiphatic p+1-valent radical with groups Z bonded directly to the aromatic ring, R6 is hydrogen, Ca to Cg alkyl or phenyl, and R7 is methyl or hydrogen,<br>
and mixtures thereof and<br>
d) a polymer comprising a polyester segment, said polymer being at least partially crystalline at room temperature and having a softening temperature in the range of 40° to 125°C.<br>
The epoxy adhesive composition of the present invention is heated at a temperature of 40° to 65°C before application. Due to its low viscosity under application conditions, the epoxy adhesive composition can even be used in high volume applications, which require high application speeds.<br>
At application temperatures, compound d) softens and re-thickens by partial crystallization when cooled down after the application, leading to a structural adhesive having a high viscosity at low shear strains and a higher thixotropy compared to structural adhesives known in the art. At a low shear strain of about 0.001, the solidified epoxy adhesive composition has a high viscosity of more than 19000 Pas. Due to this high viscosity at low shear strains, the epoxy adhesive composition has a high wash-off resistance without being prehardened.<br><br>
The epoxy adhesive composition of the present invention shows ail the requested properties of excellent structural adhesives such as a good corrosion resistance, high mechanical strength and a high crash resistance. Thus, an epoxy adhesive composition has a lap shear strength of 20 to 30 MPa, an impact peel value of more than 35 N/ram at room temperature, a tensile strength of about 30 MPa, a young modulus of about 1500 and a tensile elongation at break of more than 10%.<br>
Generally, the cured epoxy adhesive composition tends to a more obvious cohesive bonding failure mode in mechanical testing than the structural adhesives based on the technology described in EP-A-0 308 664 and in EP-A-0 353 190. Additionally, the oil absorption is improved over that referenced state of the art.<br>
Component d) can be a polyester or a copolymer comprising a polyester segment, such as a polyurethane polyester copolymer or an epoxy resin comprising a polyester segment.

In such an embodiment, component d) does not interfere with the rheological and mechanical mproperties of the other components of the composition or their mixture. The viscosity increase, i.e. the re-thickening by partial crystallization of the adhesive composition of the present invention is almost fully reversible by heating.<br>

Generally, at least one epoxy resin is a liquid epoxy resin. If desired for a specific field of application, the basic viscosity of the epoxy adhesive composition can be increased by adding at least one epoxy resin which is solid at room temperature, such as D.E.R. 671 (The Dow Chemical Company).<br><br>
