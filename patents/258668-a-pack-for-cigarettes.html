Cigarette Pack<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a pack for cigarettes or the like, composed of two partial packs, which are pivotably connected to one another and are formed as a hard pack, for in each case one cigarette group, with front sides of the partial packs facing one another in the closed position.<br>
Double packs of said type for cigarettes are also referred to as Etui packs. The two partial packs are independent from one another with regard to the withdrawal of cigarettes, that is to say are provided with separate closure elements (DE-U-79 01 873).<br>
The invention is based on the object of designing cigarette packs of the type specified in the introduction, that is to say in particular Etui packs, in such a way that industrial high-capacity production is possible, and on the other hand that the handling for the consumer is improved.<br>
To achieve said obj ect, the pack according to the invention is characterized by the following features:<br>
a)	each partial pack is a complete, discrete pack,<br>
b)	the partial packs are connected to one another in the region of two side walls, which are adj acent to one another, by a joint strip whose one limb is connected to the one partial pack and whose other limb is connected to the other partial pack,<br>
c)	the joint strip is connected to the two side walls, in particular over the full area, by means of adhesive or thermal sealing.<br><br>
Accordingly, the partial packs are, according to the invention, complete, in particular in each case individually produced cigarette packs, preferably of known design. The two partial packs are in particular embodied as shell &amp; slide packs or as hinge-lid packs. In the case of the first mentioned pack type, only the shells of the two partial packs are pivotably connected to one another, so that the slides can be actuated independently and individually for the withdrawal of cigarettes.<br>
In the case of partial packs of shell &amp; slide design, the connecting or joint strip preferably extends over the entire height of the shells. In the case of partial packs of hinge-lid box design, the joint strip is arranged only in the region of a (lower) box part, so that the hinge lid which is conventional in said pack type can be freely actuated.<br>
A further peculiarity of the invention is the method for producing the Etui packs, specifically the placement of the partial packs together and the attachment of the j oint strip, with integration into a continuous production process.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the packs according to the invention, and a schematic diagram of the production method, are explained below on the basis of the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1  shows,  in  a  perspective  illustration,  a<br>
cigarette pack composed of two partial packs, with the partial packs in a spread position,<br>
Figure 2  shows the pack as per figure 1 with the slide<br>
of the partial packs open,<br>

enlarged scale, Figure 7  shows a (relatively large) shell for the pack<br>
as  per  figure   5,   in  a  perspective<br>
illustration, Figure 8  shows a second, relatively small shell for<br>
the pack as per figure 5,  likewise in a<br>
perspective illustration, Figure 9  shows an unfolded blank for a slide of the<br>
one or other partial pack, Figure 10 shows a double pack or Etui pack of another<br>
embodiment, in a perspective illustration, Figure 11 shows the pack as per figure 10 in the open<br>
position, and Figure 12 shows,  in a perspective view,  a schematic<br>
movement diagram during the production of<br>
packs having two partial packs.<br>
The cigarette pack is composed of two partial packs 10, 11. Said partial packs 10, 11 are connected to one another to form a pack unit, in such a way that the two partial packs 10, 11 are pivotable relative to one another, specifically in the region of an upright linear joint 12 which is formed in the region of two pack edges 13, 14, which face one another, of the partial packs 10, 11. The two partial packs 10, 11 are discrete, complete (cigarette) packs which are joined together to form a unit by a connecting element, specifically by a connecting strip or joint strip 15 which forms the linear j oint 12 in the region of a parting plane between the two partial packs 10, 11. In<br><br>
the closed position (figure 5) , the two partial packs 10, 11 bear against one another with their front sides.<br>
The two partial packs 10, 11 are cuboidal hard packs for in each case one group of cigarettes 16, that is to say a cigarette group 17. Each cigarette group 17 is expediently surrounded by an inner envelope 18 made from paper or tin foil in order to form a cigarette block. The inner envelope 18 forms a conventional upper flap 19 which can be detached by means of a perforation line before the first withdrawal of cigarettes.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments as per figures 1 to 9, the two partial packs 10, 11 are shell &amp; slide packs of fundamentally known design. Each partial pack 10, 11 is composed of an outer shell 20, 21 and a slide 22, 23 which can be moved within the shell 20, 21. The shell 20, 21 is composed of a blank which is folded into a cuboid shape so as to form four pack edges which are rectangular in cross section. Situated in the region of a side wall 24, 25 are two rim lobes or tube lobes 26, 27 and 28, 29 which overlap one another. In the region of said tube lobes 26, 27 on the one hand and 28, 2 9 on the other hand, the joint strip 15 is preferably fastened by means of adhesive over the full area and over the entire height of the shell 20, 21, and specifically is connected to the outer tube lobes 26, 28. The tube fold is designed such that free edges of the outer tube lobes 26, 28 face one another, so that a gap generated here is covered by the joint strip 15. The two partial packs 10, 11 are accordingly arranged in offset relative positions with respect to one another. Stepless pack edges 30, 31 are thus formed adjacent to the edges of the connecting strip 15.<br>
Each slide 22, 23 is composed of a slide wall 32 having side lobes 33 which are attached to both longitudinal<br><br>
sides and are folded into a transversely-aligned position, and having closure tongues 34, 35 on opposite sides of the slide wall 32. The closure tongues 34, 3 5 are folded so as to form a (lower) base wall 36 and an upper end wall 37 of the slide 22, 23. The base wall 36 and end wall 37 are adjoined by in each case one plug-in lug 38, 39. The latter bears in each case against the front side of the slide 22, 23, specifically against a front wall 40, 41 of the shell 20, 21.<br>
The pack content, specifically cigarettes 16, can be withdrawn from one or the other partial pack 10, 11. Here, the respective slide 22, 23 is moved into a withdrawal position (figure 2). In the open position of the closure tongue 34, the flap 19 can be removed and a cigarette 16 can be withdrawn.<br>
The actuation, specifically the movement of the slide 22, 23 within the shell 20, 21, is facilitated by means of recesses which are formed in the region of the front wall 40, 41 of the shell 20, 21 and/or in the region of a rear wall 42, 43. In the exemplary embodiment as per figure 1, figure 2, a curved depression 44, 45 is formed in the region of an upper transverse edge of the front wall 40, 41. Said depression 44, 45 interacts with a (relatively small) depression 46, 47 situated opposite in the region of the rear wall 42, 43. In order to partially pull out the slide 22, 23, the latter is gripped in the upper region, specifically at opposite sides in the region of the depressions 44, 46 or 45, 47.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment as per figure 3, figure 4, a recess 48, 49 is formed only at the front wall 40, 41 in the lower region of the shell 20, 21. Said recess 48, 49 facilitates the sliding out of the slide 22, 23 into a position as per figure 4. The recesses 48, 4 9<br><br>
expediently have a depth which corresponds to the upper end position of the slide 22, 23 for the withdrawal of the pack content.<br>
In the closed position of the pack (figure 5, figure 6) , the partial packs 10, 11 bear against one another with their front walls 40, 41. Said position is secured by easily detachable connecting means, in the present case by a detachable glue connection. The latter is composed here of a spot of glue 50 which is applied originally only to one of the partial packs 10, 11. The glue here is of the stick/stick type, that is to say is a permanent adhesive. During the first connection of the partial packs 10, 11 by means of the spot of glue 50, a mating spot 51 is formed on the opposite pack wall, that is to say front wall 41, which mating spot 51 interacts with the spot of glue 50 during further closing processes.<br>
The two partial packs 10, 11 can be of the same size. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the partial packs<br>
10,	11 are designed to be of different depths, that is<br>
to say with side walls 24, 25 of different widths. The<br>
relatively large partial pack 11 is dimensioned to hold<br>
two rows of cigarettes in the saddle position. The<br>
dimensions of the relatively small partial pack 10 are<br>
determined for a single row of cigarettes. The total<br>
content of the pack in the exemplary embodiment is 20<br>
cigarettes.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment as per figure 10 and figure<br>
11,	the partial packs 10, 11 are embodied as hinge-lid<br>
packs. Said pack type is as standard composed of a<br>
lower box part 52, 53 and a cover 54, 55. The latter is<br>
connected by means of a linear joint to the box part<br>
52, 53 in the region of a box rear wall 56 or cover<br>
rear wall 57. The two hinge-lid boxes are arranged to<br><br>
form a double pack in such a way that front sides face one another, that is to say box front walls 58, 59 and cover front walls 60, 61. Each hinge-lid box is also provided with a conventional collar-62.<br>
One peculiarity is the arrangement of the joint strip 15. The latter extends only over a partial height of the pack, specifically in the region of the box parts 52, 53 . In this way, the covers 54, 55 can be opened and closed again unhindered in the spread position of the partial packs 10, 11.<br>
One peculiarity is the production method schematically illustrated in figure 12. The two partial packs 10, 11 are produced separately, if appropriate in separate packers (not shown) . The two partial packs 10, 11 are supplied on separate pack conveyer paths 63, 64 to a grouping station 65. In the latter, the two (different) partial packs 10, 11 are placed one on top of the other to form the double pack.<br>
On account of the described relative position, one of the partial packs 10, 11 is rotated by 180° while being transported, so that in the region of the grouping station 65, the partial packs 10, 11 bear with the front sides against one another, specifically one above the other. The partial pack 11 - which is relatively large in the present example - is supplied to the grouping station 65 along a pack conveyer path 64 with an upwardly-directed conveyer section, an upper, horizontal conveyer section and a downwardly-directed conveyer section. The downwardly-directed conveyer section causes a rotating movement of the partial packs 11 while the latter are being transported, in each case in the region of a deflection of 90°. In the region of the grouping station 65, the packs 11 are placed on the<br><br>
partial packs 10 which are supplied along the pack conveyer path 63.<br>
The partial packs 10, 11 (not yet connected to one another) are conveyed as a unit along a horizontal conveyer path 66, for example by means of a plunger, into the region of a connecting station 67. An element for attaching the joint strip 15 to the partial packs 10, 11 which are situated on above the other acts in said region. Here, said element is a transfer roller 68 which is rotatable about a vertical axis. The j oint strips 15 are transported, and are for example held by means of vacuum air, at the outer periphery of said transfer roller 68. In each case one joint strip 15 is transferred to the partial packs 10, 11, which move past the transfer roller 68, in the region of the side walls.<br>
The double packs which are produced in this way are then supplied to a packing machine for the application of an outer film envelope.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
