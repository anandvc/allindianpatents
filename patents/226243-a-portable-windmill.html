				<td>Field of the invention:-<br>
The present invention relates to a portable windmill operable by artificial wind energy, produced in the opposite direction, when a vehicle or a person is moving with some speed or with the artificial wind produced by fan or blower.<br>
Large differences in the incident solar flux on the earth's upper surface lead to different air temperatures all over the globe, hi regions with strong solar radiation, the atmospheric air gets heated, and it expands giving rise to a high-pressure region. At places where radiation is less, air gets cooler giving rise to a low-pressure region. These air pressure differences in the atmosphere cause an acceleration of air particles as a result of which air movement begins. This air movement is termed as wind. The winds, which originate due to pressure gradients, are called as gradient winds."<br>
In other words, wind in general means which comes naturally, as explained above, and more particularly, in the present context, using wind by the windmills, as a source, which are attached to the earth or a permanent structure and converting it into electrical energy.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
It is known to the art that the energy of wind can be utilized to turn turbines of the electric generators. The capacity of electricity generated is also to be dependent on the wind speed. It is well known that hundreds of wind mills in different parts of the country and abroad are being successfully operated utilizing wind power for the generation of electricity and /or for running pumps for irrigation purpose and the like. Significantly enough, the wind power is found to have an advantageous overall efficiency as compared to other non-conventional energy source such as the solar energy, in particular the average efficiency of windmills is found to be 35% as compared to 5-15% available in solar units.<br>
The use of wind power to generate electricity is thus common and the methodology involved comprises of conveying the motion of wind to the dynamo to generate electricity. The electricity thus generated can be utilized immediately or stored in batteries or can also be possibly fed into the regional power grid.<br>
The conventional wind power for the generation of electricity as discussed above, are large in dimensions and are required to be installed on the ground. Such wind mills are essentially of huge dimensions with the blade assembly area covering approximately a circular part of about 5 meters diameter. Accordingly for installation of such windmills having (Swept Area) a blade configuration of the dimensions as noted above, the support system for the wind mill also requires a corresponding huge and stable base structure. Importantly, such conventional wind mills have specific constructional requirements including the very high height (approx 30 meters) of the installation tower, large dimensional area of coverage for the blades, the orientation of the blade with respect to wind as also the ground for installation of the turbine tower. In view of the above said, the utility of wind energy was restricted over the years to only large-scale generation of electricity. It was thus known the volume of space and area of operation was required for installation of wind mills for generation of large scale electricity and no small scale utility based application of wind power is known to (he art.<br>
Disadvantages of conventional windmills;<br>
-	Large areas are needed, typically, propellers 1 to 3 meters in diameter,<br>
deliver power in the 30 to 300 W range.<br>
-	Present indications are that the optimum economic diameter of a wind<br>
turbine with a two-bladed-propeller type blade assembly is about 110<br>
meters; the electric power output would range from 2000 to 5000 kW or<br>
2 to 5 megawatts (MW), where 1 MW is 1000 kW or 1 million watts.<br>
-	Towers: Four types of supporting towers deserve consideration, these are:<br>
(a) the reinforced concrete tower (b) the pole tower (c) the built up shell-tube tower (d) the truss tower.<br>
-	The minimum tower height for a small WECS is about 10 meters, and the<br>
maximum practical height is estimated to be roughly 60 meters.<br>
"Importantly, it was further experienced that a mere proportionate reduction in the dimension of the wind mill and its installation structure from those conventionally used for generation of large scale electrical energy was not sufficient to provide utility based small scale application of wind power". It is thus evident that although knowledge is available in the field to convert wind power into electrical energy by way of the conventional wind mills, such useful characteristics of a non-conventional energy source such as wind power could not be extended to use for generating required small scale out<br>
put Power (electricity) for portable and handy utilization of the wind power as a source of non-conventional energy for operating appliances/instruments requiring small scale input power.<br>
A moving person who requires electricity in order to operate portable devices is not in a position to get electricity produced by the conventional windmills, taking into consideration the disadvantages, as explained above.<br>
Since the person on the move cannot utilize or get the electricity from the convention windmills, the present "new product", is projected to serve the need of the person on the move without using any kind of man power or muscle power or physical energy to generate the required electricity to utilize the same for operating portable devices.<br>
The present invention is a new product and is an independent device which is handy and can be carried along with the end user, using the artificial wind, as the source for generating electricity, available in the opposite direction of a person who is on the move or utilizing the wind generated by fans, blowers etc., for generating electricity to operate portable devices or recharge batteries of portable devices.<br>
The existing and the conventional windmills are stationary and are fixed and/or planted to the ground or any permanent fixtures and are not movable and they cannot be carried along with an individual person, to generate electricity.<br>
The electricity generated by the conventional and existing wind mills, cannot be easily transmitted to the persons on the move who requires electricity to operate portable devices or recharge batteries of portable devices.<br>
