TO TRANSMIT POWER TO A DRIVELINE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,257 filed on 11/04/2007 which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure is related to controlling an engine within a hybrid<br>
vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005] An internal combustion engine is mechanically coupled to an electro-<br>
mechanical transmission to transmit power to a driveline in response to an<br>
operator torque request. A method for operating the engine includes defining<br>
a two-dimensional search region based upon an input power transmittable<br>
between the internal combustion engine and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission. The method further includes iteratively dividing the two-<br>
dimensional search region into a plurality of subregions based upon one of the<br>
input power and the input speed, iteratively determining an engine operating<br>
point within each of the subregions, iteratively calculating an operating cost to<br>
operate the internal combustion engine and the electro-mechanical<br>
transmission to meet the operator torque request for each engine operating<br>
point within each of the subregions, and iteratively identifying the subregion<br>
having a minimum operating cost to meet the operator torque request. A<br>
preferred engine operating point is determined based upon the engine<br>
operating point within the identified subregion having the minimum operating<br>
cost to meet the operator torque request.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict an exemplary electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain in accordance with the present disclosure is depicted in Fig. 1,<br>
comprising a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14 and first and second<br>
electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can be<br>
transferred to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14 and<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transferred to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input and motor torques, referred to<br>
herein as T1, TA, and Tb respectively, and speed, referred to herein as N1, Na,<br>
and Nb, respectively.<br>
[0012] The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transfer torque to<br>
the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can be either a spark-ignition or<br>
a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14 includes a crankshaft (not<br>
shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of the transmission 10. A<br>
rotational speed sensor 11 monitors rotational speed of the input shaft 12.<br>
Power output from the engine 14, comprising rotational speed and engine<br>
torque, can differ from the input speed N1 and the input torque T1 to the<br>
transmission 10 due to placement of torque-consuming components on the<br>
input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a hydraulic<br>
pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0013] The exemplary transmission 10 comprises three planetary-gear sets<br>
24, 26 and 28, and four selectively engageable torque-transferring devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used herein, clutches refer to<br>
any type of friction torque transfer device including single or compound plate<br>
clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for example. A hydraulic control<br>
circuit 42, preferably controlled by a transmission control module (hereafter<br>
'TCM') 17, is operative to control clutch states. Clutches C2 62 and C4 75<br>
preferably comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. Clutches<br>
C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled stationary<br>
devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68. Each of<br>
the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 is preferably hydraulically<br>
applied, selectively receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42.<br>
[0014] The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 preferably comprise<br>
three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not shown) and a rotor (not<br>
shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The motor stator for each<br>
machine is grounded to an outer portion of the transmission case 68, and<br>
includes a stator core with coiled electrical windings extending therefrom.<br>
The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported on a hub plate gear that<br>
is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second planetary gear set 26. The<br>
rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly attached to a sleeve shaft<br>
hub 66.<br>
[0015] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., Na and Nb, respectively.<br>
[0016] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power to the driveline 90 that is transferred to vehicle wheels<br>
93, one of which is shown in Fig. 1. The output power at the output member<br>
64 is characterized in terms of an output rotational speed No and an output<br>
torque To. A transmission output speed sensor 84 monitors rotational speed<br>
and rotational direction of the output member 64. Each of the vehicle wheels<br>
93 is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted to monitor wheel speed,<br>
Vss-whl, the output of which is monitored by a control module of a distributed<br>
control module system described with respect to Fig. 2, to determine vehicle<br>
speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking control, traction<br>
control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0017] The input torque from the engine 14 and the motor torques from the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and Tb respectively) are<br>
generated as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. The ESD<br>
74 is high voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27.<br>
The transfer conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor<br>
switch 38 is closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between<br>
the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric<br>
current flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM<br>
19 transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by<br>
transfer conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power<br>
to and from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31 to meet<br>
the torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in<br>
response to the motor torques Ta and Tb. Electrical current is transmitted to<br>
and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged<br>
or discharged.<br>
[0018] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to meet the commanded motor torques TA and TB.<br>
The power inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors (not shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC<br>
power for powering respective ones of the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72, by switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors form a switch mode power supply configured to receive control<br>
commands. There is typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for<br>
each phase of each of the three-phase electric machines. States of the<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors are controlled to provide motor drive<br>
mechanical power generation or electric power regeneration functionality.<br>
The three-phase inverters receive or supply DC electric power via DC transfer<br>
conductors 27 and transform it to or from three-phase AC power, which is<br>
conducted to or from the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 for<br>
operation as motors or generators via transfer conductors 29 and 31<br>
respectively.<br>
[0019] Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain described in Fig. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to meet control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UP) 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator controls or directs operation of the electro-mechanical hybrid<br>
powertrain. The devices include an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP'), an operator<br>
brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector 114 ('PRNDL'), and a<br>
vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The transmission gear selector 114<br>
may have a discrete number of operator-selectable positions, including the<br>
rotational direction of the output member 64 to enable one of a forward and a<br>
reverse direction.<br>
[0020] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality including e.g.,<br>
antilock braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple<br>
communications buses may be used to improve communications speed and<br>
provide some level of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication<br>
between individual control modules can also be effected using a direct link,<br>
e.g., a serial peripheral interface ('SPI') bus (not shown).<br>
[0021] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the hybrid powertrain,<br>
serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and<br>
BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 determines an<br>
operator torque request, an output torque command, an engine input torque<br>
command, clutch torque(s) for the applied torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2<br>
62, C3 73, C4 75 of the transmission 10, and the motor torques TA and TB for<br>
the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The TCM 17 is operatively<br>
connected to the hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions<br>
including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and<br>
generating and communicating control signals to various solenoids (not<br>
shown) thereby controlling pressure switches and control valves contained<br>
within the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0022] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T1,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br>
speed, N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters including, e.g., a<br>
manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, ambient air temperature, and<br>
ambient pressure. The engine load can be determined, for example, from the<br>
manifold pressure, or alternatively, from monitoring operator input to the<br>
accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control engine actuators, including, e.g., fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0023] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, No, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0024] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range Pbat_min to Pbat_max.<br>
[0025] A brake control module (hereafter 'BrCM') 22 is operatively<br>
connected to friction brakes (not shown) on each of the vehicle wheels 93.<br>
The BrCM 22 monitors the operator input to the brake pedal 112 and<br>
generates control signals to control the friction brakes and sends a control<br>
signal to the HCP 5 to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based thereon.<br>
[0626] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, BPCM 21,<br>
and BrCM 22 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing operation of the<br>
hybrid powertrain. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
the occurrence of an event.<br>
[0027] The exemplary hybrid powertrain selectively operates in one of<br>
several operating range states that can be described in terms of an engine state<br>
comprising one of an engine-on state ('ON') and an engine-off state ('OFF'),<br>
and a transmission state comprising a plurality of fixed gears and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Table 1, below.<br>
[0028] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. A first continuously<br>
variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying clutch C1 70<br>
only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. The engine state can be one of ON ('M1_Eng_On') or OFF<br>
('M1_Eng_Off'). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 2, or<br>
M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to the<br>
carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON<br>
('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off'). For purposes of this description,<br>
when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to zero<br>
revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating. A<br>
fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed<br>
of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO A first fixed gear operation ('G1') is<br>
selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75. A second fixed gear operation<br>
('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C2 62. A third fixed gear<br>
operation ('G3') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth<br>
fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73.<br>
The fixed ratio operation of input-to-output speed increases with increased<br>
fixed gear operation due to decreased gear ratios in the planetary gears 24, 26,<br>
and 28. The rotational speeds of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72, NAand Nb respectively, are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and are proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0029] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque<br>
generative devices comprising the engine 14 and first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output member<br>
64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from the user<br>
interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP 5<br>
determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque from the<br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, an input torque from the engine 14, clutch<br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0030] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors including,<br>
e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The operating range state is<br>
determined for the transmission 10 based upon a variety of operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powerrrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The operating range state<br>
may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain torque demand caused by a<br>
command to operate the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 in an<br>
electrical energy generating mode or in a torque generating mode. The<br>
operating range state can be determined by an optimization algorithm or<br>
routine which determines optimum system efficiency based upon operator<br>
demand for power, battery state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the<br>
engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The control<br>
system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 based upon an outcome of the executed<br>
optimization routine, and system efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage<br>
fuel economy and battery charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined<br>
based upon a fault in a component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the power output from the transmission 10<br>
required in response to the desired output torque at output member 64 to meet<br>
the operator torque request. As should be apparent from the description<br>
above, the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 are<br>
electrically-operatively coupled for power flow therebetween. Furthermore,<br>
the engine 14, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, and the<br>
electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively coupled to<br>
transfer power therebetween to generate a power flow to the output member<br>
64.<br>
[0031] Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show a method 200 for determining a preferred<br>
operating point for operating the engine 14 and the transmission 10 to transmit<br>
power to the driveline 90 in response to an operator torque request ('TO_req'),<br>
and a graph 300 of an iterative search performed using the method 200. The<br>
method 200 is preferably utilized during operation in the first and second<br>
continuously variable modes. During the first and second continuously<br>
variable modes, the transmission 10 transmits mechanical power using one<br>
clutch, i.e., either clutch C1 62 or C2 70 from the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machine 56 and 72, and the engine 14 operates at an operating<br>
point described in terms of power to the transmission 10 at an operating point<br>
described in terms of the input speed N, and the input torque TV The method<br>
200 controls the engine 14 at the operating point by preferably executing<br>
algorithms and calibrations in the HCP 5 that includes conducting a two-<br>
dimensional search to determine the preferred engine operating point. The<br>
preferred engine operating point can include an input power Pengj from the<br>
engine that comprises the input speed H multiplied by the input torque T1.<br>
[0032] Boundary conditions of the engine operating points are defined (248).<br>
In one embodiment, the boundary conditions define a two-dimensional search<br>
area 303 from which a plurality of engine operating points 302 can be<br>
provided within the two-dimensional search area 303. The two-dimensional<br>
search area 303 is determined based upon the input power Peng_1 transmitted<br>
from the engine 14 to the transmission 10. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
two-dimensional search area 303 comprises a range of permissible input<br>
power values from -1 kW to 40 kW and a range of permissible input speed<br>
values from 600 RPM to 2000 RPM. In alternate embodiments, the two-<br>
dimensional search area 303 comprises a range of permissible input speed<br>
values and a range of permissible input torque values or a range of permissible<br>
input power values and the range of permissible input torque values.<br>
[0033] The range of permissible input power values associated with engine<br>
input power include input power values ['Y'] from a minimum permissible<br>
input power ['Ymin'] to a maximum permissible input power ['Ymax']. The<br>
range of permissible input speed values from the engine 14 include input<br>
speed values ['X'] from a minimum permissible input speed ['Xmin'] to a<br>
maximum permissible input speed ['Xmax']. The HCP 5 utilizes the output<br>
speed No of the transmission 10 and the operator torque request TO_req in a<br>
lookup table (not shown) to obtain the minimum permissible input power<br>
Ymin, the maximum permissible input power Ymax, the minimum permissible<br>
input speed XMin, and the maximum permissible input speed XMax. In<br>
alternative embodiments, the minimum permissible input power Ymin, the<br>
maximum permissible input power YMax, the minimum permissible input<br>
speed Xmin, and the maximum permissible input speed XMax can be based on<br>
measurements of other operating properties of the powertrain.<br>
[0034] The maximum permissible input power Ymax and the minimum<br>
permissible input power Ymin are normalized such that the maximum<br>
permissible input power YMax corresponds to a normalized maximum input<br>
power ['Ymax'] which has a value of one, and the minimum permissible input<br>
power Ymin corresponds to a normalized minimum permissible input power<br>
['Ymin'], which has a value of zero. The maximum permissible input speed<br>
Xmax and the minimum permissible input speed Xmin are normalized such that<br>
the maximum permissible input speed Xmax corresponds to a normalized<br>
maximum permissible input speed ['Xmax'] which has a value of one, and the<br>
minimum permissible input speed Xmin corresponds to a normalized minimum<br>
permissible input speed ['Xmin'], which has a value of zero.<br>
[0035] In one embodiment each of the engine operating points 302 is a<br>
predetermined engine operating point associated with a predetermined<br>
coordinate (that is, a predetermined normalized input speed value x and a<br>
predetermined normalized input power value y) of the two-dimensional search<br>
area 303. The engine operating points 302 are stored in one of the memory<br>
devices accessible by the HCP 5. In one embodiment, a distance between<br>
each of the engine operating points 302 is spaced at equal increments of<br>
normalized input speed x and normalized input power y throughout the two-<br>
dimensional search area 303.<br>
[0036] The HCP 5 defines search regions within the two-dimensional search<br>
area 303. In one embodiment, a single search region comprises the entire area<br>
of the two-dimensional search area 303. In one embodiment, more search<br>
regions are provided by dividing the two-dimensional search area 303 at<br>
normalized input speed values x, at normalized input power values y, or at<br>
both normalized input speed values x and normalized input power values y. In<br>
one embodiment, the HCP 5 defines search regions by segmenting the two-<br>
dimensional search area 303 into three search regions by providing lines at<br>
two normalized input speed values. In one embodiment, the HCP 5 defines<br>
the search regions by providing a plurality of search regions such that each<br>
search region is a rectangle. In one embodiment, the HCP 5 defines search<br>
regions such that each search region has an equal area.<br>
[0037] The HCP 5 defines the search regions by segmenting the two-<br>
dimensional search area 303 into a plurality of search regions comprising<br>
search regions 310, 312, 314, 316, 318, 320, 322, 324, and 326.<br>
[0038] The HCP 5 determines an engine operating point within each search<br>
region 310, 312, 314, 316, 318, 320, 322, 324, and 326. In one embodiment,<br>
the HCP 5 determines an engine operating point located at a center of each<br>
search region 310, 312, 314, 316, 318, 320, 322, 324, and 326. Each search<br>
region includes one of a corresponding first plurality of engine operating point<br>
350, 352, 354, 356, 358, 360 and 362. In one embodiment, each engine<br>
operating point is precalibrated and is preassociated with one of the search<br>
regions in the memory device. The search region 310 includes the engine<br>
operating point 350, the search region 312 includes the engine operating point<br>
352, the search region 314 includes the engine operating point 354, a search<br>
region 316 includes the engine operating point 356, a search region 318<br>
includes the engine operating point 358, a search region 320 includes the<br>
engine operating point 360, a search region 322 includes the engine operating<br>
point 362, a search region 324 includes an engine operating point 364, and a<br>
search region 326 includes the engine operating point 366.<br>
[0039] The HCP 5 calculates an operating cost Pcost to operate the engine<br>
14 associated with each engine operating point 350, 352, 354, 356, 358, 360,<br>
362, 364, 366 and associated with the operator torque request To_req and the<br>
output speed No of the transmission 10 by executing a cost function f(X,Y,<br>
No, To_req) (252). The HCP 5 calculates an operating cost to operate the<br>
internal combustion engine and the electro-mechanical transmission to meet<br>
the operator torque request To_req for each engine operating point within each<br>
of the subregions. The HCP 5 determines the speed relationship as defined<br>
shown in Eq. 1, below:<br>
wherein, NO is the output speed, NAis the operating speed for the first electric<br>
machine 56, NB is the operating speed for the second electric machine 72, and<br>
b11, b12, b21, D22, are known scalar values determined for the specific<br>
application in the specific operating range state. Therefore, the determined<br>
scalar values for b11, b12, b21, b22 are specific to each of EVT Mode 1 and EVT<br>
Mode 2. In this application, when the transmission output speed, NO is known,<br>
there is one degree of freedom in input speed N1, by which NA and NB can be<br>
determined.<br>
[0040] The HCP 5 determines the torque the relationship as shown in Eq. 2,<br>
below:<br>
[0041] wherein the To is the transmission output torque at which is set to the<br>
operator torque request TO_req, Ta and TB are the operating torques for MG-A<br>
56 and MG-B 72, N1 and No represent time-rate changes in input speed from<br>
the engine 14 and output speed of the transmission 10, and d11, d12, d13, d14,<br>
d21, d22, d23, d24 are known scalar values determined for each operating range<br>
state, i.e., either one of EVT Mode 1 and EVT Mode 2, of the application. In<br>
this application, when the transmission output torque To is known, there is one<br>
degree of torque freedom for input torque T1, by which TAand TB can be<br>
determined.<br>
[0042] The HCP 5 denormalizes each engine operating point of the first<br>
plurality of engine operating points to their corresponding input speed and<br>
input power values (X,Y) using scaling based on normalization. The HCP 5<br>
inputs the operator torque request To_req , the output speed No and the input<br>
speed and input power values (X,Y) of each engine operating point of the first<br>
plurality of engine operating points into the cost function f(X,Y, No, To_req)<br>
252 to determine the overall cost Pcost. The cost function f(X,Y, No, To_req)<br>
252 comprises operating costs which are generally determined based upon<br>
factors that include vehicle driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and battery<br>
usage. Furthermore, costs are assigned and associated with fuel and electrical<br>
power consumption and are further associated with a specific engine operating<br>
points of the powertrain. Lower operating costs are generally associated with<br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for an engine operating point, and take into<br>
account a current operating state of the powertrain system. The overall system<br>
power loss comprises a term based upon engine power loss driven by fuel<br>
economy and exhaust emissions, plus losses in the mechanical system (e.g.,<br>
gears, pumps, belts, pulleys, valves, chains), losses in the electrical system<br>
(e.g. wire impedances and switching and solenoid losses), and heat losses.<br>
Other losses include electrical machine power losses and internal battery<br>
power losses. Other factors may also be considered, including factors related<br>
to battery life due to depth of discharge of the ESD 74, current ambient<br>
temperatures and their effect on state of charge of the battery.<br>
[0043] The HCP 5 calculates a cost PCost352, a cost PCOst354, a cost PCost356, a<br>
COSt PC0ST358, a COSt PC0ST360, a COSt PCoST362, a COSt PCost364, and a COSt PCost366<br>
for the corresponding engine operating points 352, 354, 356, 358, 360, 362,<br>
364, respectively. The HCP 5 performs a base point determination by<br>
determining which of the cost PCost352, the cost PCost354, the cost PCOst356, or the<br>
cost PCost358, the cost Pcost360, the cost PCost362, the cost Pcost364, and the cost<br>
Pcost366 has the lowest value, and determines the engine operating point<br>
associated with the lowest value as a base point of the first plurality of engine<br>
operating points. FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary embodiment in which the HCP<br>
5 identifies a lowest cost of the first plurality of cost values to be the cost<br>
Pcost350 and therefore, identifies the engine operating point 350 as the base<br>
point of the first plurality of engine operating points and the search region 310<br>
as the base search region of the first plurality of search regions.<br>
[0044] The HCP 5 segments the search region 310 into a first plurality of<br>
subregions utilizing the search engine 250 based on normalized input speeds x.<br>
In one embodiment, the HCP 5 divides the search region 310, into a first<br>
plurality of subregions comprising a subregion 328, a subregion 330, and a<br>
subregion 332. The HCP 5 determines an engine operating point within each<br>
of the subregions of the first plurality of subregions. In one embodiment, the<br>
HCP 5 determines an engine operating point located at a geometric center of<br>
each of the subregions. In one embodiment, each of the subregions of the first<br>
plurality of subregions includes one of a second plurality of engine operating<br>
points comprising engine operating points 350, 368, and 370. In one<br>
embodiment, the subregion 328, the subregion 330 and the subregion 332 have<br>
a rectangular shape. In one embodiment, the subregion 328 includes the<br>
engine operating point 368, the subregion 330 includes the engine operating<br>
point 350, and the subregion 332 includes the engine operating point 370.<br>
[0045] The HCP 5 executes the cost function 252 to calculate a cost PCOst<br>
associated with each engine operating point of the second plurality of engine<br>
operating points. The HCP 5 calculates a third plurality of cost values<br>
comprising a cost PCost368 and a cost PCosT37o for the engine operating point 368,<br>
and the engine operating point 370, respectively. The HCP 5 performs the<br>
base point determination by determining which of the cost PCost368, the cost<br>
Pcost370, or the cost PCost350 has the lowest value, and determines the engine<br>
operating point associated with the lowest value as the base point of the<br>
second plurality of engine operating points. FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary<br>
embodiment in which the HCP 5 identifies a lowest cost of the second<br>
plurality of cost values to be the cost PCost350 and therefore, identifies the<br>
engine operating point 350 as the base point of the second plurality of engine<br>
operating points and the subregion 330 as the base subregion of the first<br>
plurality of subregions.<br>
[0046] The HCP 5 segments the subregion 330 into a second plurality of<br>
subregions based on the normalized input power y. In one embodiment, the<br>
HCP 5 divides the subregion 330 into subregions 334, 336, and 338. In one<br>
embodiment, subregions 334, 336 and 338 have a rectangular shape. In one<br>
embodiment, the subregions 334, 336, and 338 are orthogonal to the first<br>
plurality of subregions. In one embodiment, the subregion 334 includes the<br>
engine operating point 372, the subregion 336 includes the engine operating<br>
point 350, and the subregion 338 includes the engine operating point 374. A<br>
third plurality of engine operating points includes engine operating points 350,<br>
372, and 374.<br>
[0047] The HCP 5 executes the cost function 252 to calculate a cost PCoSt<br>
associated with each engine operating point of the third plurality of engine<br>
operating points. The HCP 5 calculates a cost PCost372 and a cost PCOst374 for<br>
the engine operating point 372, and the engine operating point 374,<br>
respectively. The HCP 5 performs the base point determination by<br>
determining which of the cost PCost372, the cost PCOst350, or the cost PCOst374 has<br>
the lowest value, and determines the engine operating point associated with<br>
the lowest value as the base point of the third plurality of engine operating<br>
points. FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary embodiment in which the HCP 5<br>
identifies a lowest cost of the third plurality of cost values to be the cost<br>
Pcost374 and therefore, identifies the engine operating point 374 as the base<br>
point of the third plurality of engine operating points and the subregion 338 as<br>
the base subregion for the second plurality of subregions.<br>
[0048] The HCP 5 determines a third plurality of subregions comprising<br>
subregions 340, 342, and 344 based on the engine operating point 350. The<br>
HCP 5 determines a cost PCost376 for an engine operating point 376 in<br>
subregion 340, a cost PCost378 for an engine operating point 378 for engine<br>
operating point 378 in subregion 344. The HCP 5 performs the base point<br>
determination by determining which of the cost PCost372, the cost PCost374, or<br>
the cost PCost378 has the lowest value, and determines the engine operating<br>
point associated with the lowest value as the base point for the fourth plurality<br>
of engine operating points. FIG. 4 depicts an exemplary embodiment in which<br>
the HCP 5 identifies a lowest cost of the fourth plurality of engine operating<br>
points to be cost PCost376 and therefore, determines the engine operating point<br>
376 as the base point and the subregion 340 as the base subregion.<br>
[0049] The HCP 5 determines a fourth plurality of subregions comprising a<br>
subregion 346, a subregion 348, and a subregion 349 based on the engine<br>
operating point 376. The HCP 5 determines a cost PCost380 for an engine<br>
operating point 380 in subregion 346, and a cost PCost382 for an engine<br>
operating point 382in subregion 340. The HCP 5 performs the base point<br>
determination by determining which of the cost PCost380, the cost PCost376, or<br>
the cost PCost382 has the lowest value, and determines the engine operating<br>
point associated with the lowest value as the base point for the fifth plurality<br>
of engine operating points.<br>
[0050] The HCP 5 continues to utilize the search engine 250 and the cost<br>
function 252 until a selected number of costs are calculated, or a<br>
predetermined number of iterations are executed. Although, the<br>
predetermined number iterations can be determined based on a desired search<br>
resolution or a desired search speed, in one embodiment, ten iterations are<br>
performed. In one embodiment, eleven iterations are performed. In one<br>
embodiment, the HCP 5 calculates 100 cost values. In one embodiment, the<br>
HCP 5 calculates 30 cost values. The HCP 5 determines a preferred engine<br>
operating point within the iteratively identified subregion (that is, the<br>
subregion identified as having a engine operating point with a lowest cost<br>
Pcost after a predetermined number iterations) having the minimum operating<br>
cost to meet the operator torque request. The preferred engine operating<br>
points associated with an optimal speed value Xopt and an optimal input<br>
power value Yopt.<br>
[0051] The HCP 5 utilizing the method 200 to calculate cost values Pcost<br>
rapidly due to the separation of the search engine 250 and the cost function<br>
252. In particular, the search engine 250 determines pluralities of engine<br>
operating points and provides each plurality of engine operating points to the<br>
cost function 252 such that the cost function 252 of cost only has to solve for<br>
one unknown variable per engine operating point. The HCP 5 utilizing the<br>
method 200 to calculate twenty-eight cost values in less than twenty-five<br>
milliseconds.<br>
[0052] In alternative embodiments, the HCP 5 performs other amounts of<br>
cost calculations. Further, in other alternative embodiments, the HCP 5<br>
performs cost calculations until a selected amount of time elapses or until a<br>
selected search tolerance level is reached.<br>
[0053J The powertrain is controlled based on the optimal engine operating<br>
point as determined by the search engine 250 and the cost function 252. The<br>
values for Xopt, Yopt are translated to an optimal input speed N1_opt and an<br>
input power P1_opt from the engine 14. Optimal input torque T1_opt is<br>
determined by dividing optimal input speed N1_opt by the optimal input power<br>
P1_opt. The HCP 5 commands operation of the engine 14 at optimal input<br>
torque T1_opt and optimal input speed N1_opt (254).<br>
[0054] As mentioned above, the HCP 5 utilizes the method 200 to control<br>
the transmission 10 in the first or second continuously variable modes. The<br>
HCP 5 controls the input speed and input torque of the engine utilizing Eqs. 1<br>
and 2 as described wherein the input speed N1 is set to the optimal input speed<br>
N1_opt, and wherein the input torque T, and is set to the optimal input torque<br>
T1_opt.<br>
[0055] The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment(s)<br>
disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure, but<br>

A method for operating an engine includes defining a two-dimensional<br>
search region based upon an input power transmittable between the internal<br>
combustion engine and an electro-mechanical transmission. The method<br>
further includes iteratively dividing the two-dimensional search region into a<br>
plurality of subregions based upon one of the input power and the input speed,<br>
iteratively determining an engine operating point within each of the<br>
subregions, iteratively calculating an operating cost to operate the internal<br>
combustion engine and the electro-mechanical transmission to meet the<br>
operator torque request for each engine operating point within each of the<br>
subregions, and iteratively identifying the subregion having a minimum<br>
operating cost to meet the operator torque request. A preferred engine<br>
operating point is determined based upon the engine operating point within the<br>
identified subregion having the minimum operating cost to meet the operator<br>
torque request.</td>
