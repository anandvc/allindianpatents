DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention, accordina to the parent application, relates to a steam conversion proce.ss and catalyst for use in upgrading a heavy, hydrocarbon feedstock such as an extra heavy crude or feedstock including a residue fraction having a boiling point greater than 500° C, and to a process for preparing the catalyst.<br>
In the invention according to the parent application, a steam conversion process and catalyst are provided which advantageously enhance     conversion     of      such      heavy     hydrocarbon      feedstock      as<br>
5<br><br>
compared to conversion obtained using conventional visbreaking or thermal cracking procedures, and further which provide a lower production rate of undesirable solid by-products such as coke.<br>
The feedstock }o be treated in accordance rwith the r invention of the parent application may be any suitable heavy hydrocarbon feedstock wherein    conversion   to    lighter   more   valuable    products    is   desired.    The<br>
feedstock   may,   for   example,   be   a   feedstock   including   a   residue   fra'ction<br>
'	..it<br>
having a boiling point greater than 500°C or having a significant portion having a boiling point greater than 500°C and an additional portion having a boiling point in the 350°C-500°C range, or may be substantially the residue fraction itself, for [example after fractionating of a particular initial feedstock, or could be a vacuum residue or any other suitable feed. Table 1 set forth below contains characteristics of a typical example of a suitable feedstock for treatment in accordance with the invention^of the parent application.<br>

A vacuum residue as characterized in Table 1 is an example of a suitable feedstock which can advantageously be treated in accordance with the invention of the parent application. Of course, numerous other feeds could be treated as well.<br>
In accordance with the invention of the parent application, a steam conversion process is provided for upgrading a heavy hydrocarbon feedstock such as that of Table 1 so as to upgrade the hydrocarbon feedstock to provide liahter. more valuable products. According to the invention of the parent application, the feedstock is contacted, under steam conversion conditions, with a catalyst according to the invention of the parent application in the form of a catalytic water in oil emulsion containing a first alkali metal and a second metal selected from Group-VIII non-noble metals, alkaline earth metals, and mixtures thereof, whereby the heavy hydrocarbon feedstock is upgraded.<br>
Steam conversion conditions according to the invention, of the parent application   include   a temperature of   between about 360°C to about 520°C,<br>
7<br><br>
preferably between 410°C to 470°C ; a pressure of less than or equal to about 600 psi, and preferable between about 5 psi to about 600 psi, ideally less than or equal to about 300 psi and preferable between about 10 osi to about 300 osi : a liquid hourly space velocity of between about 0.001 h"1 to about 3.5 rr1 depending upon the desired severity of treatment ; and steam in an amount between 1% to about 15% wt, preferably between about 3% to about 12% wt. based upon the feed.<br>
Depending upon the feedstock to be treated, process pressure may suitably be substantially atmospheric, or may be- somewhat higher, for example between 50 psi to about 600 psi, preferably between about 100 psi to about 300 psi.<br>
Steam conversion conditions are advantageous as compared to conventional conversion with hydrogen because lower pressures can be used than would be needed to maintain hydrogen. Tftus, the steam conversion process of the invention according to the parent application allows, for reduction in cost of equipment and the like for operating at elevated pressures.<br>
The catalyst or catalytic emulsion prepared according to the process of the present invention is preferably'provided in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion, preferably having an average droplet size of less than or equal to about 10 microns, more preferably less than or equal to about 5 microns, and having<br>
8<br><br>
a ratio of water 'ito oil by volume of between about 0.1 to about 0.4, more preferably between about 0.15 to about 0.3. According to the [invention, the catalytic emulsion is provided so as to include a first alkali metal, preferably potassium, sodiuiii or mixtures thereof, and a r second metal which may preferably be a Group VIII non-noble metal, preferably nickel or ^cobalt, or an alkaline earth metal, preferably calcium or-magnesium, or mixtures thereof.  The catalytic emulsion^may suitably contain various combinations of the above first and second metals, and particularly preferred combinations include potassium and nickel; sodium and nickel; sodium and calcium; and sodium, calcium and nickel.  The catalytic emtflsion preferably contains the first alkali metal at a concentration of at least about 10,000 ppm basedj!upon the catalytic emulsion, and also preferably contains first alkali metal and second metal at a ratio by weight of between about 0.5:1 to about 20:1, more preferably between about 1:1 to about 10:1.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the catalytic , emulsion is preferably prepared by providing an acidic hydrocarbon stream, preferably having an acid number of at least about 0.5 mg KOH/g of hydrocarbon, wherein the acid number is defined by ASTMD 664-89.  The acid number, as set forth in,ASTMD 664-89, is the quantity of'base, expressed in milligrams of potassium hydroxide per gram of sample,<br>
9<br><br>
required to titrate a sample in the solvent from its initial' meter reading to a meter reading corresponding to a freshly prepared non-aqueous basic buffer solution.  In the present invention, this number is used to refer to the quantity of base required to neutralize the acidity of the acidic hydrocarbon stream being used to prepare the catalytic emulsion of the present invention.<br>
To the acidic hydrocarbon stream, water solutions of the desired catalyst metals are added as follows to prepare the desired datalytic emulsion.<br>
A solution of the first alkali metal in water is provided for mixing with the acidic hydrocarbon stream. According to the invention, the solution of alkali metal in water is preferably a saturated solution containing alkali metal within about 5% of the saturation point of the solution at ambient temperature, wherein the saturation point is the point beyond which additional alkali metal would not dissolve in solxition and would, instead, precipitate from the solution.  More dilute solutions could be used, however, the volume of water added ends up as part ©f the catalytic emulsion and eventually must be vaporized during treatment of the feedstock,  it is^ therefore preferred to provide the solution as indicated above within about 5% of the saturation point so as to avoid unnecessary heating demands.<br>
10<br><br>
According to the invention, the acidic hydrocarbon stream and solution of alkali metal in water are combined and mixed so as to at least partially neutralize the hydrocarbon stream and form a substantially homogeneous mixture wherein the alkali metal reacts with the hydrocarbon stream to provide an alkali organic salt, and preferably reacts with naphthenic acid contained in the hydrocarbon stream to provide an alkali naphthenic salt.  This step can be carried out entirely within a mixer, if desired, or the streams may be combined upstream of a mixer and fed to the mixer for suitable mixing to provide the desired substantially homogeneous mixture, which may at this point be an emulsion.  The hydrocarbon stream and amount of alkali metal are preferably selected such that substantially all alkali metal reacts to form alkali organic salt, preferably alkali naphthenic salt, while at least partially and preferably substantially neutralizing acidity of the hydrocarbon stream.  This helps to insure the substantially homogeneous incorporation of the alkali metal into the end catalyst emulsion.<br>
Conversion of alkali metal to alkali organic salt is desirable because alkali still in hydroxide form in the mixture could react with second metal salts during later mixing to provide undesirable second metal oxides such as nickel oxideiwhich adversely affect the overall process.<br>
11<br><br>
Further,   remaining   high   acidity   is, in most cases,   undesirable as corrosive to mixing equipment and the like.<br>
A second solution is provided of the second metal, Group VIII non-nobie metal, alkaline earth metal or a mixtu.ce of both in water. The second solution is also preferably a saturated solution, most preferably containing suitable second metal in an amount within 5%, more preferably within 2% of the saturation point of the second solution. The second metal is preferably provided in the second solution in the form of an acetate, such as nickel acetate, for example.<br>
The second solution is then combined and mixed by methods known per se with the substantially homogeneous mixture of the first solution and acidic stream as described above. The second solution and substantially homogeneous mixture may be combined in a mixing apparatus for carrying out the mixing step, or upstream of the mixing apparatus, as desired in accordance with the parameters of a specific process.<br>
This second mixing step wherein the second solution is mixed with the substantially homogeneous mixture provides the catalytic emulsion as described above, wherein the first alkali metal in the form of alkali naphthenic salt is located in the interface between water droplets and   the   continuous   oil   phase   and   acts   as   a   s urfactant,    and    wherein<br>
12<br><br>
the second metal remains dissolved in the water droplets of the emulsion.<br>
It should be noted that the mixing steps as set forth above are carried out using equipment which is.well known in the art and which forms no part of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the acidic hydrocarbon stream from which the catalytic emulsion is prepared preferably has an acid number of between, about 0.4 ing KOH/g to about 300 mg KOH/g,  inis stream can oe obtained from the heavy hydrocarbon feedstock to be treated, if the feedstock is suitably acidic.  Alternatively, the acidic hydrocarbon stream can be provided from any other suitable source.  It is preferred "that the acidic hydrocarbon stream contain anr organi<p acid preferably naphthenic apid which has been found to advantageously react with alkali metal during preparation of the catalytic emulsion so as provide desired salt acts a surfactant additional stability and droplet size for present invention.></p>
During the mixing steps, the alkali naphthenic salt migrates to the interface between water droplets and the oil continuous ph|se of the catalytic emulsion and acts as a surfactant to-assist in maintaining the stability of the emulsion, and helps to insure a sufficiently small droplet<br>
13<br><br>
size   which    provides    or   good    dispersion    of   the    second    metal    in    the feedstock.<br>
Use of the catalytic emulsion containing the catalytic^first and second metals advantagepusly serves to enhance the rapid distribution of the catalytic metals throughout a feedstock being upgraded according Jo the .process of the present invention so as to greatly improve conversion of the heavy residue fraction or other feedstock. When the catalytic emulsion and feedstock are rmixed, the catalytic metals are substantially dispersed throughout the feedstock and it is believed that steam conversion conditions then serve to vaporize water from the emulsion to provide at least some of the steam requirements for the process and also to result in a very fine particulate, partly solid and partly melted, of the first and second catalytic metals in close contact with the feedstock thereby enhancing the desired conversion to lighter products.<br>
Furthermore, the steam conversion process according to the invention of tltie parent application, results, under; conditions ,of increased severity, in provision of an upgraded hydrocarbon product, and also a residue or coke by-product which, while being of a greatly reduced amount as compared to conventional processes, has also been found to contain the spent first and second catalytic metals. The by-product, is    either    residue    or    coke    or    both    depending    upon   severity    of    the<br>
14<br><br>
process. In accordance with the process of the invention of the parent application, the coke or residue by-product is preferably further treated, for example through desalinization for residue or gasification for coke, to recover the catalytic metals for subsequent use in preparing catalytic emulsion for continuing steam conversion processes. Such procedures have been found to recover a large amount of the alkali metal when residue is desalted and, in some cases, to provide a recovery of greater than 100% of the second metal, especially Group VIII non-noble metal, when gasification of the carbonaceous solid (coke) by-product is performed along with a high yield of recovery of alkali metal. When the by-product is mainly residue, it can be desalted ,!for metal recovery by dilution for example up to about 14° API and then transported for conventional desalinization.<br>
In a typical process in accordance with the invention of-the parent application, a heavy hydrocarbon feed is passed through a furnace for providing a desired temperature, and then to a fractionator for separating out various fractions to provide the heavy hydrocarbon residue feedstock which is to be treated in accordance with the invention of the parent application.<br>
r<br>
If the by-product of the process is rich in solid (i.e., coke greater than or equal to about 5%), the residue-can be gasified or controlled combusted, and the resulting ash can be washed to recover alkali metal by water<br>
15<br><br>
dissolution while any remaining solid can be treated in the presence of CO2 and ammonia to produce NiCO3i which can be converted into nickel acetate using acetic acid at room temperature. This of course is for the cas.e where tbe second metal is nickel. Further, recovery of higher than 100% of the spent nickel,.can be obtained using this method since some nickel indigenous to the feed is recovered above and beyond the process nickel used in forming the catalytic emulsion.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 schematically illustrates an example of a system for carrying out the steam conversion process of the invention according to the parent application.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, heavy hydrocarbon feedstock to be treated is fed to a furnace 10 for heating to a suitable temperature, and then to an atmospheric or vacuum fractionator 12 for separating off light components. Heavier components from fractionator 12 are fed toward another furnace 14 for further heating, and subsequently to a soaker/reactor 16 for carrying out the conversion process. As shown in Figure 1, a catalyst preparation unit or station 18 is proviided wherein the catalytic emulsion of the present invention is prepared. This catalytic emulsion can be mixed with the feedstock to be converted at a number of different locations. Fiaure 1 shows the catalytic emulsion being injected   to   the   feedstock   after   fractionator   12   and   before<br>
16<br><br>
furnace 14.  Alternatively, catalytic emulsion could be mixed with the hydrocarbon feedstock after furnace 10 and before fractionator 12, as indicated by point 20, or could be introduced after furnace 14 and before soaker/reactor 16 as shown at point 22.<br>
Still referring to Figure 1, the product of soaker/reactor 16 is recombined with light products from fractionator^ 12, and fed to cyclone stripper 24 wherein upgraded hydrocarbon products are separated from byproducts.  The upgraded product is fed to fractionator 26 where the upgraded product is separated into various fractions including a gas topping, naphtha, gasoil and bottoms, whil-e by-product is fed through a heat exchanger 28 to a desalting unit 30 for additional processing as desired. Diluent may be added to this fraction, as shown in the drawing, as desired.<br>
At desalting unit 30, catalytic metals are recovered from" the by-products, and are preferably returned to catalyst preparation unit 18 for use in preparing additional catalytic emulsion for use in the process of the present invention, with additional or make-up metals being added as needed.  Further, and also shown in Figure 1, a. portion of feedstock from furnace 10 may be diverted to catalyst preparation unit 18, if desired for use as the acidic hydrocarbon stream from which the catalytic emulsion is<br>
17<br><br>
prepared. This is particularly preferable if the hydrocarbon feedstock to be treated has sufficient acidity or other surfactant content.<br>
It should of course be noted that although a schematic representation of a system for carrying out the conversion process of the invention according to the parent application is shown in Figure 1, the process could of course be carried out using different steps and different equipment, and no limitation upon the scope of the invention according to the parent application is intended.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, an alternate schematic representation of a process in accordance with the invention of the parent application is illustrated in connection with a process for producing synthetic crude oil from extra heavy crude oil.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, an extra heavy crude feedstock typically having a low API gravity, for example less than or equal to about 10°, may suitably be mixed with a diluent to increase the API gravity, for example to about 14°, so as to allow treatment of the feedstock at a conventional desalting unit 32. From desalting unit 32, the desalted feed mav suitably be fed to an atmospheric distillation unit 34, wherein diluent for subsequent feedstock dilution is separated, as are other lighter products and an atmospheric residue. The atmospheric residue is preferably mixed with catalytic emulsion according to the present invention from a catalyst preparation station 36, and fed to soaker/reactor<br>
18<br><br>
3 8 for carrying out the conversion of the present invention. As shown, the mixture of feedstock and catalytic emulsion is exposed in soaker/reactor 38 to steam conversion conditions, for example a pressure of 10 barg and temperature of 440°C. From soaker/reactor 38 is provided an upgraded hydrocarbon product and a by-product containing residue and/or coke as well as catalytic metal from the catalytic emulsion.  This by-product mixture is fed to a heat exchanger 4 0 and then to a desalting unit 42 where catalytic metal salts are removed through gasification and/or desalinization and returned to catalyst preparation station 36, while a transportable synthetic crude oil product of the present process is provided typically having an improved API gravity, for example greater than or equal to 13°.<br>
It should of course be appreciated that although Figure 2 constitutes a schematic representation of ,a preferred embodiment of the process; of the present .invention, no limitation upon the scope of the present invention is intended.<br>
Referring now to Ficjure 3, a further schematic representation^ of a process for preparing a catalytic emulsion in accordance with the present invention is provided.  Figure.3 shows an inlet of an acidic hydrocarbon stream such as a naphthenic acid rich hydrocarbon stream which is fed to a heat exchanger 44, and then mixed with a<br>
19<br><br>
saturated   solution   of  alkali   hydroxide   in   water.    The   naphthenic   acid   rich stream   and   saturated   alkali     solution   are     preferably     mixed     such   that acidity   . of     the   hydrocarbon  stream   is  at  least  partially     neutralized,   and substantially alhalkali hydroxide in the saturated solution is reacted to form alkali naphthenic salt. This reaction is enhanced, and an emulsion may be formed, in a mixer 46 to which the hydrocarbon   stream/alkali saturated   solution   mixture is fed.   After this step, the mixture is passed from mixer 46 to a finishing station 48 for  neutralization of any remaining acidity of the hydrocarbon   stream, if needed. Following finishing^station 48, a second saturated solution of the second catalytic metaf,   in this example a solution of nickel acetate in water, is mixed with   the mixture from finishing station 48   and passed to an additional mixer 50   wherein sufficient mixing energy is imparted to provide the desired catalytic water-in-oil emulsion    having the first  alkali  metal in the form of an  alkali  naphthenic  salt located at the   interface between water droplets and the continuous oil phase and   also  acting  as a  surfactant,    and   having the second   metal,   in this case nickel   acetate,   dissolved in the   water   droplets of the^ emulsion.   The alkali naphthenic   salt   surfactant serves to   provide   the   desired small   droplet size which   advantageously   results   in   good   dispersion of  the    catalytic    metal,<br>
20<br><br>
especially the  sefeond   catalytic  metal,   through  a  feedstock  to. be   upgraded according to the invention.<br>
The emulsion may then be passed to a buffer tank 52, if needed, and subsequently to a treatment system for steam conversion of a heavy hydrocarbon feed in accordance with the present invention. The catalytic emulsion so formed preferably has a droplet size of less than or equal to about 10 microns, more preferably less than or equal to about 5 microns and ideally about 1 micron.<br>
It should of course be realized that although Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of a system for preparing a catalytic emulsion in accordance with the presenf invention, this schematic representation is not intended as a limitation upon the scope of the present invention.<br>
The following examples demonstrate the advantages of the process according to the parent application and catalytic emulsion of the present invention.<br>

The feedstock of Table 1 (acid number 25 mg KOH/g) was used to prepare a catalytic emulsion according to the invention using potassium and nickel. The catalyst emulsion was prepared by first mixing a stream of feedstock   and   a   40% wt.   solution   of<br>
21<br><br>
KOH, and then mixing a solution of nickel acetate at a ratio (wt) of K:Ni of 4:1.  The catalytic emulsion was mixed with the feedstock so as to provide 1000 ppm of potassium and 250 ppm nickel acetate with respect to the feedstock, and the reaction mixture was subjected to steam conversion conditions including a temperature of 430°C and LHSV^h'1, 8% wt. steam based on feed (Process 1).  The emulsion and feedstock were treated in a soaker having a volume of 1.2 liters.  Feed flow was 2400 g/h, while catalytic emulsion flow was 113 g/h.<br>
The same feedstock was subjected to visbreaking under the same conditions, without using a catalyst and using a small amount of steam (Process 2).  The conversion and other process completion parameters are set forth in Table 2 below.<br><br>

Further,    the    final    product    of    Process    1    according    to    the invention    includes    an    upgraded    hydrocarbon    as   well    as    a    long    and short    residue    which    has    been    found    according    to    the    invention    to contain   most   if   not   all   of   the   catalytic   metal   of   the   catalyst   emulsion. This   catalytic   metal   can   be   recovered   according   to   the   invention   through desalination   or   gasification   for   use   in   preparation   of   additional   catalytic emulsion    for   subsequent   processing    according    to   the    invention.    In    this case,    the    residue    fraction    product    of    Process    1    was    desalted    and potassium    was     recovered    up    to    94% . (wt)    of    the    original    starting potassium.<br>

The feedstock was treated with a catalytic emulsion as prepared in Example 1, in the same proportions as set forth above.<br>
As shown, the process according to the invention of the parent application provided excellent conversion of the residue fraction 500°O, and provided a high yield of lighter hydrocarbon fractions as well. Also the coke production was substantially less than 9% as compared to the more than 30% coke which is typically obtained using conventional delayed coking procedures. This reduction in coke   is   particularly<br>
24<br><br>
useful   in   reducing   solids   which   must   be   transported   or   disposed   of.<br>
Further, the process of the invention according to the parent application provided a by-product of carbonaceous solids that contained almost all of the catalyst metals. By gasification of the coke, 95% (wt) of the starting alkali metal (potassium) yvas recovered for use in preparing additional catalytic emulsion, and through simple dissolution with acetic acid, 110% of the transition metal (nickel) was recovered.<br>

Yields Based on Feed.<br>
From    Table    6,    several,   observations    can    be    made. .   It    is clear     that     the     syncrude      obtained     from     delayed     coking     has     in<br>
29<br><br>
principal better quality as compared to that provided according to the process of the invention of the parent application. However, the proportion of solids produced conventionally is much higher than that produced according to the invention of the parent application. Further, the process of the invention according to the parent application produced an increased proportion of middle distillates, and the residue from this process can' of course be further refined, even using delayed coking, if desired, to produce overall higher yields of lower boiling point fractions.<br>
The reduced coke production of the process according to the invention of the parent application is advantageous for example when syncrude is produced in remote zones, where major investments in facilities for solid transportation would be needed to transport the coke and thereby avoid environmental impact in the remote area. Further, the coke produced according to the invention of the parent application can be completely burned using, the heat released for other internal process needs while simultaneously recovering from resulting ash the catalytic metals as discussed above for re-use in additional catalytic emulsion preparation.<br>
30<br><br>
Example 5<br>
This example illustrates the effective conversion of hydrocarbon feed following the process of the invention according to the parent application using catalytic emulsion having different combinations of catalytic metals. The conversions were carried out using the fraction 500°C+ obtained from vacuum distillation of the crude of Table 4. The examples were carried out at a temperature of 440°C, pressure of 1 barg, and ratio of feed/steam of 7. A continuous operation was implemented with constant flow of feedstock (60 ml/h) and steam, for 4 hours for example. A stirred tank reactor was used having a volume of 100 ml. The results are set forth below in   Table   7.<br>
