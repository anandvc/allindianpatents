				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An arrangement in a spinning machine for condensing a fibre strand<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement in a spinning machine for condensing a fibre<br>
strand, comprising a condensing zone arranged downstream of a front roller pair of a drafting<br>
unit, also comprising an air-permeable transport belt which transports the fibre strand<br>
through the condensing zone, also comprising a suction channel arranged to the condensing<br>
zone, also comprising a sliding surface arranged to the suction channel which guides the<br>
transport belt, and also comprising a suction slit, bordered by two lateral edges one of which<br>
edges is designed as a slanted fibre guiding edge which positions the fibre strand<br>
transversely to the direction of motion of the transport belt arranged.<br>
When a drafted fibre strand is imparted its spinning twist directly downstream of the front<br>
roller pair, then a so-called spinning triangle occurs at the nipping line of the front roller pair.<br>
This happens because the drafted fibre strand leaves the drafting unit having a certain width<br>
and is then twisted to a thread having a relatively small diameter. The spinning triangle<br>
comprises lateral fibres, which are not properly bound into the twisted thread and thus<br>
contribute little or nothing to the tensile strength of the spun thread. As a solution to this<br>
problem, a so-called condensing zone has, in recent times, been arranged directly<br>
downstream of the drafting zone of a drafting unit, said condensing zone being in turn<br>
bordered by a nipping line. The thread is imparted its twist only after leaving the condensing<br>
zone. The fibres are bundled or condensed in the condensing zone, whereby the fibre strand<br>
is so narrow when it leaves the last nipping line that the feared spinning triangle does not<br>
occur. The spun thread is stronger, more even, and less hairy.<br>
An arrangement of the above mentioned type is prior art in US patent 6,223,514. In this<br>
publication it is stated that between the stationary sliding surface of the suction channel and<br>
the underside of the transport belt which runs over the sliding surface, fibre fly and trash can<br>
settle, whereby the prior art discloses that the trash occurs, for example, in that single fibres<br>
of the fibre strand to be condensed, in particular the short fibres, reach inwards through the<br>
perforation of the transport belt with their front ends into the area of the suction slit.<br>
Experience has shown that single fibres can also reach the underside of the transport belt<br>
laterally.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to prevent to a large extend the accumulation of fibre<br>
fly at the end of the suction slit in an arrangement of the above mentioned type.<br>
This object has been achieved according to the present invention in that the suction slit is<br>
provided in its end area with an area wider than that of a middle area arranged upstream<br>
thereof, while maintaining the fibre guiding edge.<br>
Due to the embodiment of the present invention, there is an increased volume of throughput<br>
air at the end area of the suction slit, so that at this point fibre accumulations do not occur at<br>
all, or at least do not occur so easily. Maintaining the fibre guiding edge extending<br>
transversely to the direction of motion of the transport belt prevents the fibre strand losing the<br>
desired condensing effect. This is already achieved when the fibre guiding edge extends in<br>
the end area of the suction slit exactly in the direction of motion of the transport belt. In<br>
principal it is, however, correcter when the fibre guiding edge retains its transverse position<br>
to the end of the suction slit, with the widened area being provided exclusively on the side of<br>
the suction slit facing away from the fibre guiding edge.<br>
In order to prevent any fibres which may separate from the fibre strand from getting caught<br>
on the outer edge of the suction slit, an unbroken graduation for the widened area from the<br>
middle area of the suction slit to its end area is advantageoully provided. It is further possible<br>
that the widened area has an essentially circular design.<br>
As a starting point for a practical rule of calculation, it can be given that the widened area<br>
should measure approximately double the width of the middle area. of the suction slit. If a<br>
suction slit measures 1.5 to 2 mm in its middle area, then the widened area in the end area<br>
of the suction slit should measure between 2.5 and 3.5 mm.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a partly intersectional side view of an arrangement for condensing a fibre strand,<br>
Figure 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow II of Figure 1 of the actual condensing zone,<br>
having a suction slit according to the present invention,<br>
Figures 3 to 6 are, in enlarged form, several embodiments for a suction slit according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Of a spinning machine, in particular a ring spinning machine, only the area of an<br>
arrangement 1 for condensing a drafted, still twist-free fibre strand 2 is shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2. The arrangement 1 is located directly downstream of a drafting unit 3, of which only<br>
the front roller pair 4 as well as an apron roller pair 5 arranged in transport direction A<br>
upstream of the front roller pair 4 are shown. The apron roller pair 5 guides a lower apron 6<br>
and an upper apron 7. The front roller pair 4 comprises a driven front bottom cylinder 8 as<br>
well as a front pressure roller 9 pressed flexibly thereagainst. The front roller pair 4 defines a<br>
front nipping line 10, which forms the end of the drafting zone of the drafting unit 3.<br>
In the drafting unit 3, a sliver or a roving 11 is drafted in the known way to the desired degree<br>
of fineness in transport direction A. This drafting process ends at the front nipping line 10,<br>
and from this line on a drafted, but still twist-free fibre strand 2 is present. In order to avoid<br>
the known and disadvantageous spinning triangle when the spinning twist is being imparted,<br>
the fibre strand 2 is condensed directly downstream of the front nipping line 10 in a<br>
condensing zone 12.<br>
The arrangement 1 provided for condensing comprises an air-permeable transport belt 13,<br>
which can, for example, be designed as a closed-meshed, thin woven belt made of synthetic<br>
fibres and which transports the fibre strand 2 to be condensed through the condensing zone<br>
12. The arrangement 1 also comprises a suction channel 14, which is designed as a hollow<br>
profile with prevailing low pressure and which extends over a plurality of spinning stations.<br>
The suction channel 14, for the purpose of guiding the transport belt 13 is, on its outer<br>
contour facing the condensing zone 12, designed as a sliding surface 15.<br>
A suction slit 16 is located in the sliding surface 15, which suction slit 16 is arranged slightly<br>
transversely to the direction of motion B of the transport belt 13, so that in relation to the fibre<br>
strand 2 to be condensed, the suction slit 16 comprises a fibre guiding edge 17. The fibre<br>
strand 2 travels along this fibre guiding edge 17 during condensing, whereby the fibres<br>
located in the fibre strand 2 are bundled or condensed transversely to the direction of motion<br>
B of the transport belt 13, whereby the fibre strand 2 is rolled in somewhat.<br>
The suction channel 14 is connected via a vacuum connection 18, which is located at a<br>
distance to the suction slit 16, to a vacuum source (not shown). If the suction channel 14<br>
extends over a plurality of spinning stations, only one vacuum connection 18 need be<br>
provided per machine section.<br>
The condensing zone 12 is limited on its outer side by a nipping roller 19, which presses the<br>
fibre strand 2 and the transport belt 13 to the sliding surface 15 while defining a delivery<br>
nipping line 20, which acts as a twist block in relation to the spinning twist to be imparted.<br>
The nipping roller 19 drives the transport belt 13 and is in turn driven via a transfer wheel 21<br>
by the front pressure roller 9.<br>
Downstream of the delivery nipping line 20, the produced thread 22 receives a spinning twist,<br>
as the thread 22 is fed in delivery direction C to a twist element (not shown), for example a<br>
ring spindle. The delivery nipping line 20 serves as a twist block to the spinning twist, so that<br>
the spinning twist cannot retroact back into the condensing zone 12.<br>
The transport belt 13 is tensioned by means of a tensioning element 23 on the side facing<br>
away from the suction slit 16, which tensioning element 23 can, for example be designed as<br>
a stationary rod or also as a guiding roller. The tensioning element 23 is arranged hereby in<br>
such a way that the transport belt 13 is disposed with a slight pressure on the front bottom<br>
cylinder 8. Because the transport belt 13 and the front bottom cylinder 8 rotate in opposite<br>
directions at the line of contact, the transport belt 13 is hereby cleaned of any fibre fly which<br>
has adhered thereto.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the starting area 24 of the suction slit 16 is provided with a<br>
widened area 25, which serves the purpose of reliably seizing the fibre strand 2, which<br>
traverses slightly tranversely to the direction of transport A, despite the narrow suction slit 16.<br>
In the middle area 26, the suction slit 16 has a relatively narrow width of, for example,<br>
between 1.5 to 2 mm.<br>
It has been shown that in the condensing zone 12, single fibres from the fibre strand 2 get in<br>
sideways under the transport belt 13 and become caught between the underside of the<br>
transport belt 13 and the sliding surface 15, in particular in the end area 27 of the suction slit<br>
16. On the other hand, other fibres can penetrate into the perforations of the transport belt<br>
13. These fibres, which are not bound into the thread 22, can, in time, block the perforations<br>
of the transport belt 13, thus causing a reduction in the condensing effect at some spinning<br>
stations, which in turn results in a thread 22 having a different hairiness at some spinning<br>
stations.<br>
In order to avoid fibre fly accumulations at the end area 27 of the suction slit 16, this end<br>
area 27 is provided with a widened area 28 which is wider than the preceeding middle area<br>
26 of the suction slit, and which is located solely on the side of the suction slit 16 facing away<br>
from the fibre guiding edge 17, as shown in the embodiment in Figure 2. This widened area<br>
28 measures approximately twice the width of the middle section 26.<br>
Due to this widened area 28, there is a significantly greater volume of through air in the end<br>
area 27 of the suction 16, so that here any occuring fibre fly accumulations most probably<br>
reach the inside of the suction channel 14 and thus subsequently also the suction removal.<br>
As the fibre guiding edge 17 extends slightly slanted in relation to the direction of motion B of<br>
the transport belt 13 up to the end of the suction slit 16, there is no risk that the condensing<br>
effect already in the fibre strand 2 is lost due to the widened area 28.<br>
In the following greatly enlarged embodiments of suctions slits 16, the fibre guiding edge 17,<br>
as well as the starting area 24, the middle section 26 and the end area 27 can be identified.<br>
In the embodiment according to Figure 3, the widened area 328 is so designed that it<br>
extends from the middle section 26 in a smooth, unbroken graduation 329. Thus fibres do not<br>
tend to settle on the side edges of the suction channel 16.<br>
In the end area 27 of the suction slit 16 according to Figure 4, the widened area 428 is<br>
circular in shape. Thus any small deflecting radii in the end area 27 of the suction slit 16 are<br>
avoided, so that the risk of fibre fly settling is reduced from a geometric point of view.<br>
The widened area 528 in the end area 27 of the suction slit 16 as shown in Figure 5 deviates<br>
from the embodiments described up to now in that here the fibre guiding edge 17 comprises<br>
an end piece 530 in the end area 27, which extends in exactly the same direction of motion B<br>
as the transport belt 13. In this embodiment also, there is not yet the tendency for the<br>
condensed fibre strand 2 to widen again at the end area 27 of the suction slit 16. More<br>
practical are embodiments in which the fibre guiding edge 17 extends slanted to the end of<br>
the suction slit 16, whereby the this slant must not extend in a constant angle.<br>
The embodiment according to Figure 6 corresponds to a large extent to that in Figure 2, that<br>
is, the suction slit 16 also comprises a widened area 625 at its starting area 24, which serves<br>
to seize the traversing fibre strand 2 at this point. Such a widened area 625 at the starting<br>
area 24 can be provided at any of the shown suction slits 16.<br>
