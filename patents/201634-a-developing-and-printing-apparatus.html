				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a developing and printing apparatus developing and printing an image onto a photographic paper using light exposure.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIGS. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional developing and printing apparatus, and FIG. 2 illustrates an internal configuration thereof. As shown therein, the conventional developing and printing apparatus 10 comprises a main body 11 in which photographic paper 13, a developer, etc. are accommodated, and an analog printing unit 41 creating a latent image from a negative of a film onto the photographic paper by emitting light toward the film and instantaneously exposing the photographic paper to the light passing through the film.<br>
Inside the main body 11 are provided the photographic paper 13 onto<br>
which the latent image is focused by the analog printing unit 41, and a paper<br>
developing part 15 developing the photographic paper 13 having the latent<br>
image. The paper developing part 15 comprises a developer tank, a bleaching<br>
tank, a washing tank, etc. The latent image obtained from the negative of the<br>
film onto the photographic paper 13 by the analog	<br><br>
printing unit 41 is developed into a positive picture after passing the photographic paper 13 through the paper developing part 15.<br>
Further, inside the main body 11 are provided a photographic paper dispenser 21 dispensing the photographic paper, a first cutter 23 cutting the photographic paper after obtaining the latent image onto the photographic paper, and a second cutter 25 cutting the photographic paper after developing and drying the photographic paper through the paper developing part 15.<br>
On the upper surface of the main body 11 is formed an opening 31 being rectangular and facing toward the photographic paper 13.<br>
Further, on the upper surface of the main body 11 is provided a supporting part 33 protruding upward and having a holding groove 35 formed along the circumference of the opening 31. To the supporting part 33 is detachably combined a negative carrier 3? on which the film to be printed and developed is placed.<br>
The negative carrier 37 is a plate having size and shape corresponding to the internal circumference of the supporting part 33 so as to be held by the holding groove 35. The negative carrier 37 is detachably combined to the supporting part 33, i.e., the negative carrier 37 is fitted in the internal circumference of the supporting<br><br>
part 33, with its lower part being held by the holding groove 35 of the supporting part 33. Further, the negative carrier 37 is formed with a light transparent hole 39 through which light passing through a diffusing pipe 47 (to be described late) passes.<br>
As the analog printing unit 41, on the upper surface of the main body ii, adjacent to the supporting part 33, are provided a first light source 43 emitting light toward the negative carrier 37, a CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) filter 45 filtering only C (cyan), M (magenta) and y (yellow) components of the light emitted from the first light source 43, and the diffusing pipe 47 provided between the CMY filter 45 and the negative carrier 37 and diffusing the filtered light to be projected on the film of the negative carrier 37. The diffusing pipe 47 is detachably combined to the CMY filter 45.<br>
As the analog printing unit 41, inside the main body 11, i.e., under the supporting part 33 are provided R (red), G (green) and B (blue) sensors 49 respectively sensing R, G and B components of the light passing through the film so as to control an exposure time according to the intensity of the R, G and B components, and a diffusing lens 51 diffusing the light which passed the R, G and B sensors 49.<br>
Under the diffusing lens 51 is provided an analog<br><br>
shutter 53 controlling the exposure time during which the photographic paper 13 is exposed to the light diffused by the diffusing lens 51.<br>
On the other hand, a discharge slot 27 discharges the photographic paper 13 cut by the second cutter 25 to the outside of the main body 11, and a sorter 29 sorts the photographic paper 13 discharged through the discharge slot 27 in good order.<br>
With this configuration, the first light source 43 emits light, and the light is filtered by the CMY filter 45, so that only C, M and Y components of the light enters the main body 11 via the diffusing pipe 47 and the film put on the negative carrier 37 in sequence.<br>
Then, the light passing through the film is sensed by the R, G and B sensors 49, so that the exposure time is determined according to the intensity of the R, G and B components of the light. Then, the diffusing lens 51 diffuses the light which passed the R, G and B sensors 49. The diffused light is projected on the photographic paper 13 instantaneously by the analog shutter 53 disposed under the diffusing lens 51, thereby obtaining the latent image onto the photographic paper 13.<br>
Thereafter, the photographic paper 13 having the latent image is cut by the first cutter 23, and then transferred to the paper developing part 15. In the paper<br><br>
developing part 15, the photographic paper 13 is placed into various solutions and the latent image thereof is developed into the positive image. The developed photographic paper 13 is dried and then cut by the second cutter 25. Finally, the cut photographic paper 13 is discharged through the discharge slot 27.<br>
Such a conventional developing and printing apparatus can develop and print only an analog image recorded on the film. By the way, it is difficult to edit and modify the analog image recorded on the film. Further, if the film is damaged, it is impossible to restore the analog image recorded on the film. Therefore, the film must be carefully kept.<br>
On the other hand, there is a digital device which captures an image electrically without the film having the above shortcomings. Further, the digital image electrically captured by the digital device can be developed and printed on the photographic paper.<br>
However, the conventional developing and printing apparatus cannot develop and print the digital image electrically captured by the digital device, but can develop and print the analog image recorded on the film not. Hence, in order to develop and print the digital image, there is separately needed a developing and printing apparatus for the digital image because the<br><br>
conventional developing and printing apparatus is useless, thereby causing a waste of material.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present invention by referring to the figures.<br>
FIG. 3 is a partial perspective view of a developing and printing apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 4 illustrates an optical system for a digital printing unit according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 5 illustrates an internal configuration of the developing and printing apparatus of FIG. 3 to which the digital printing device of FIG. 4 is attached. As shown therein, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a digital printing unit is detachably combined to the conventional developing and printing apparatus having an analog printing unit, and the digital and analog printing<br><br>
units are alternately operated, thereby developing and printing both an analog image recorded on a film and a digital image transmitted from a digital device such as a computer, etc.<br>
A developing and printing apparatus 10' according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises a main body 11 in which a photographic paper 13, a developer, etc. are accommodated, an analog printing unit 41 creating a latent image from a negative of a film onto the photographic paper 13 by emitting light toward the film and instantaneously exposing the photographic paper 13 to the light passing through the film, a digital printing unit 61 including an optical system to receive a digital signal from a computer (not shown) and to form a digital image due to the digital signal onto the photographic paper 13, a digital carrier 97 attached to the digital printing unit 61 and allowing the digital printing unit 61 to be detachably combined to a supporting part 33, and a digital shutter 99 provided under the digital carrier 97 and controlling an exposure time of the photographic paper 13.<br>
The main body 11 and the analog printing unit 41 are the same as those di sclosed in "BACKGROUND ART", and descriptions thereof will be omitted.<br>
The digital printing unit 61 includes a case 63<br><br>
having a box shape. On lateral surfaces of the case 63 are formed a handle 65 allowing a user to easily lift the digital printing unit 61 to be placed on the supporting part 33, a plurality of air vents 67 for air-cooling the inside of the case 63, and terminals 59 through which electric power is supplied to a second light source 71 (to be described later).<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the digital printing unit 61 according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes the second light source 71, an infrared filter 73 intercepting infrared rays of light emitted from the second light source 71, a RGBW (red, green, blue and white) filter wheel 77 rotating at high speed and mixing colors of the light passing through the infrared filter 73, a concave lens 79 converting the light whose colors are mixed through the RGBW filter wheel 77 into a straight ray having uniform intensity, a diffusing plate 81 diffusing the light passing through the concave lens 79, a color filter 83 filtering the light combing through the diffusing plate 81 according to color reproduction, a digital image creating part 91 on which the digital image is created in response to the digital signal transmitted from the computer, a reflecting part reflecting the light passing through the color filter 83 to the digital image creating part 91,<br><br>
and a magnifying lens 95 magnifying the digital image outputted from the digital image creating part 91 and projecting the magnified digital image toward the digital shutter 99.<br>
The second light source 71 is a halogen lati^, a light-emitting diode, or etc. Particularly, the light-emitting diode emits heat smaller than the halogen lamp emits, so that it is effective in preventing the digital printing unit 61 from being overheated. Further, the light-emitting diode can be selectively designed to emit light according to a transmittable wavelength of the RGBW filter wheel 77, so that the light-emitting diode is more effective than the halogen lamp.<br>
The RGBW filter wheel 77 is rotated by an attached motor 78 at high speed (about 7200 rpm), thereby mixing colors of the light transmitted from the infrared filter 73 to the concave lens 79.<br>
The reflecting part includes a first reflex mirror 85 and a second reflex mirror 8 7, which are arranged across the digital image creating part 91 from each other.<br>
The digital image creating part 91 is electrically connected to the cotr^uter, and includes a DMD (digital micromirror device) chip 93 to which a digital signal for editing and modifying the digital image is transmitted from the computer.<br><br>
On the other hand, the respect ive component s are arranged in the case 63 as follows. The second light source 71 the infrared filter 73, the RGBW filter wheel 77, the concave lens 79, the diffusing plate 81, the color filter 83, and the first reflex mirror 85 are aligned. Herein, Che first reflex mirror 85 is diagonally disposed at a predetermined angle relative to the axis of alignment. The second reflex mirror 87 is opposite to the first reflex mirror 85 across the digital image creating part 91. The digital image creating part 91 is perpendicular to the axis of the second light source 71. The magnifying lens 95 is aligned with the digital image creating part 91. Hence, the light emitted from the second light source 71 passes through the infrared filter 73, the RGBW filter wheel 77, the concave lens 79, the diffusing plate 81, and the color filter 83 in sequence, and is then reflected by the first reflex mirror 85. The light reflected from the first reflex mirror 85 is reflected again by the second reflex mirror 87, and projected onto the DMD chip 93, thereby allowing the DMD chip 93 of the digital image creating part 91 to create the digital image. With this arrangement, the digital printing unit 61 employed in obtaining the digital image can be designed to have a compact size, so that the digital printing unit 61 does not interrupt the CMY<br><br>
filter 45.<br>
The digital carrier 97 allowing the digital printing unit 61 to be detachably combined to the supporting part 33 is a plate having size and shape corresponding to the internal circumference of the supporting part 33 so as to be held by the holding groove 35. The digital carrier 97 is attached to a lower part of the digital printing unit 61 and allows the digital printing unit 61 to be detachably combined to the supporting part 33. The digital carrier 97 is detachably combined to the supporting part 33, i.e., the digital carrier 97 is fitted in the internal circumference of the supporting part 33, with its lower part being held by the holding groove 35 of the supporting part 33. Further, the digital carrier 97 is formed with an image transparent hole 9B through which the digital image created from the digital image creating part 91 passes.<br>
The digital shutter 99 is attached to the lower part of the digital carrier 97 and controls the exposure time of the photographic paper 13.<br>
With this configuration, operation of the developing and printing apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinbelow, wherein the operation of developing and printing the image recorded on the film has the identical process mentioned<br><br>
in "BACKGROUND ART", and it will be omitted. Further, the operation after obtaining the digital image onto the photographic paper 13 is identical with the process after obtaining the analog image onto the photographic paper 13, and it will be omitted.<br>
To develop and print the digital image, f irst, the dif fusing pipe 4 7, the R,G and B sensors 4 9, the diffusing lens 51, and the analog shutter 53 are detached from the analog printing unit 41 of the main body 11. Further, the negative carrier 37 is detached from the supporting part 33. At this time, the first light source 43 and the CMY filter 43 of the analog printing unit 41 are left as it is on the upper surface the main body 11.<br>
Thereafter, the digital printing unit 61 is fitted in the internal circumference of the supporting part 33, with its lower part being held by the holding groove 35 of the supporting part 33, thereby attaching the digital printing unit 61 to the main body 11.<br>
Thereafter, when the second light source 71 of the digital printing unit 61 is turned on, the second light source 71 emits light. The light emitted from the second light source 71 passes through the infrared filter 73, with its infrared rays being filtered out. Then, the light passing through the infrared filter 73 passes through the RGBW filter wheel 77, with its colors being<br><br>
mixed.<br>
The color mixed light is converted into a straight ray having uniform intensity by the concave lens 79, and then diffused by the diffusing plate Bi, The diffused light is filtered by the color filter 83 according to the color reproduction, and then projected onto the first reflex mirror 85.<br>
The light passing through the color filter 83 is reflected by the first reflex mirror 85 and the second reflex mirror 87, and then projected onto the DMD chip 93, thereby allowing the DMD chip 93 of the digital image creating part 91 to create the digital image.<br>
The digital image created by the digital image creating part 91 is magnified by the magnifying lens 95, and then the magnified digital image is focused onto the photographic paper 13 instantaneously by the digital shutter 99 provided under the digital carrier 97, thereby obtaining the latent image onto the photographic paper 13.<br>
Thereafter, the photographic paper 13 having the latent image is developed through the paper developing part 15. Thus, the digital image is developed and printed.<br>
As described above^ the digital printing unit is detachably combined to the conventional developing and printing apparatus having the analog printing unit, and the digital and analog printing units are alternately<br><br>
operated, thereby developing and printing both an analog image recorded on a film and a digital image transmitted from a digital device. Hence, a waste of material is prevented. Further, according as the optical system employed in obtaining the digital image is efficiently arranged, the digital printing unit can be designed to have a compact size, so that the digital printing unit does not interrupt neighboring devices.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates an optical system for the digital printing unit according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Unlike the digital printing unit 61 according to the first embodiment, a digital printing unit 61' according to the second embodiment comprises an optical cable 75 placed between the infrared filter 73 and the RGBW filter wheel 77.<br>
The optical cable 75 includes a plurality of optical fibers, and transmits light passing through the infrared filter 73 to the RGBW filter wheel 77. in this embodiment, the infrared filter 73 is incorporated with the optical cable 75 at one end of the optical cable 75 adjacent to the second light source 71.<br>
As described above, the optical cable 75 provided between the infrared filter 73 and the RGBW filter wheel 77 transmits light uniformly to the digital image creating part 91 and intercepts heat generated from the<br><br>
second light source 71, thereby reproducing a picture in vivid and natural color and preventing the digital printing unit 61' from being overheated.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates an optical system for the digital printing unit according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Unlike the digital printing unit 61 according to the first embodiment, a digital printing unit 61" according to the third embodiment comprises a digital image creating part 91 having an LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon) 94, and a reflecting part having a PBS (polarized beam splitter) 89.<br>
The PBS 89 reflects the light passing through the color filter 83 toward the LCOS 94 of the digital image creating part 91, thereby allowing the digital image creating part 91 to create the digital image.<br>
The PBS 89 is superior in low-loss light to the reflex mirror, and the LCOS 94 has higher resolution (e.g., 1365X1024} than the DMD chip. Therefore, a high-resolution digital image is created on the photographic paper 13 with small light and short time.<br>
Additionally, an optical cable may be provided between the infrared filter 73 and the RCBW filter wheel 77, so that the light passing through the infrared filter 73 is transmitted to the RGBW filter wheel 77 through the optical cable, thereby transmitting light uniformly to<br><br>
the LCOS 94 of the digital image creating part 91.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an internal configuration of a developing and printing apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. Unlike the developing and printing apparatus 10' according to one embodiment of the present invention, a developing and printing apparatus 10" can develop and print only a digital image.<br>
The developing and printing apparatus 10" shown in FIG. 8 comprises a main body 11 in which photographic paper 13, a developer, etc. are accommodated, a digital printing unit 61 with an optical system receiving a digital signal from a computer 101 and focusing a digital image on the photographic paper 13, and a digital shutter 99 provided in the digital printing unit 61 and controlling an exposure time of the photographic paper 13.<br>
Inside the main body 11 are provided the photographic paper 13 onto which the latent image is focused by the digital printing unit 61, and the paper developing part 15 developing the photographic paper 13 having the latent image. The paper developing part 15 comprises a developer tank, a bleaching tank, a washing tank, etc. The latent image obtained onto the photographic paper 13 is developed into a positive picture through the paper developing part 15.<br><br>
Further, inside the main body 11 are provided the digital printing unit 61 according to the first embodiment and the digital shutter 99, wherein the digital printing unit 61 is electrically connected to the computer 101.<br>
The computer 101 is electrically connected with a scanner 105 scanning a film, a photograph, a picture, etc. and a display 103 displaying the image scanned by the scanner 105. Thus, the computer 101 stores the film, the photograph, the picture, etc. scanned by the scanner 105 therein, and allows a user to edit and modify the stored images through the display 103.<br>
However, the digital printing unit 61' or 61" according to the second or third embodiment may be employed instead of the digital printing unit 61 according to the first embodiment.<br>
As described above, the developing and printing apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention not only develops and prints the image but also allows a user to edit and modify the stored or scanned image.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a developing and printing apparatus which can develop and print a digital image. Further, the present invention provides a developing and printing apparatus which has a<br><br>
smallest digital printing unit for obtaining a digital image. Further, the present invention provides a developing and printing apparatus which can develop and print both an analog image recorded on a film and a digital image, thereby preventing a waste of material.<br>
Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br>
