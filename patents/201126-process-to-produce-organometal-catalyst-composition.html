                            process to produce<br>
                     This invention related to field of organometal catalyst<br>
compositions.<br>
The production of polymers is a multi-billion dollar business. This business produces billions of pounds of polymers each year. Millions of dollars have been spent on developing technologies that can add value to this business.<br>
One of these technologies is called metalloceae catalyst technology. Metallocene catalysts have been known since about 1958. However, their low productivity did not allow them to be commercialized. About 1974, it was discovered that contacting one part water with one part trimethylaluminum to form methyl aluminoxane, and then contacting such methyl aluminoxane with a metallocene compound, formed a metallocene catalyst that had greater activity. However, it was soon realized that large amounts of expensive methyl aluminoxane were needed to form an active metallocene catalyst. This has been a significant impediment to the commercialization of metallocene catalysts.<br>
Fluoro organic borate compounds have been used in place of largs amounts of methyl aluminoxane. However, this is not satisfactory since these borate<br>
compounds are very sensitive to poisons and decomposition, and can also be very expensive.<br>
It should also be noted that having a heterogeneous catarys is important. This is because heterogeneous catalysts are required for most modem commercial polymerization processes. Furthermore, heterogeneous catalysts can lead to the formation of substantially uniform polymer particles that have a high bulk density. These types of substantially uniform particles are desirable because they improve the efficiency of polymer production and transportation. Efforts have been made to produce heterogeneous metallocene catalysts; however, these catalysts have not been entirely satisfactory.<br>

The solid used in this invention is selected from the group consisting of titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4), zirconium tetrafluoride (ZrF4), and a treated solid oxide compound. The treated solid oxide compound comprises a solid oxide compound having titanium tetrafluoride or zirconium tetrafluoride deposited on the surface of the solid oxide compound. Generally, any high surface area, high porosity, solid oxide compound can be used. The solid oxide compound comprises oxygen and at least one element selected from the group consisting of groups IIA-VIIIA and IB-VIIB of the Periodic Table of Elements, including lanthanides and actinides. However, it is preferred when the element is selected from the group consisting of Al, B, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, la, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Si, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, V, W, P, Y, Zn and Zr. Preferably, the solid oxide compound is selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, silica-alumina, aluminophosphate, aluminoborate, silica-zirconia, silica-titania, thoria, and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the solid oxide compound is alumina, silica, or silica-alumina. The solid oxide compound canbe produced by any method known in the art, such as, for example, by gelling, co-gelling, impregnation of one compound onto another, and flame hydrolysis.<br>
Generally, the specific surface area of the solid oxide compound is from about 100 to about 1000 m2/g, preferably, from about 200 to about S00 m2/g, and most preferably, from 250 to 600 m2/g after calcining at 500oC.<br>
The specific pore volume of the solid oxide compound is typically greater than about 0.5 cm3/g, preferably, greater than about 0.S cmVg, and most preferably, greater than 1.0 cm3/Vg.<br>
Calcining is conducted at various steps in the production of the treated<br><br>
-15-<br>
solid oxide compound. Generally, calcining of the solid oxide compound conducted at a temperature in the range of about 200° C to about 900oC, preferably in a range of about 300o to about 700°C, and most preferably in a range of 350°C to 600°C. Typically, cleaning is conducted for about 1 minute to about 100 hours, preferably for about 1 bow to about 50 hours, and most preferably, for 3 hours to 20 hours. Calcining is performed typically in an inert atmosphere. Alternatively, an oxidizing atmosphere, such as, for example, oxygen or air, or a reducing atmosphere, such as, for example, hydrogen or carbon monoxide, can be utilized.<br>
When the treated solid oxide compound is utilized to produce the catalyst composition, the TiF4 or ZrF4 can be deposited on the solid oxide compound by any means known in the art. Generally, the TiF4 or ZrF4 can be deposited on the solid oxide compound by a process of impregnation, sublimation, or decomposition of a salt For best results, the solid oxide compound contains between about 0.01 and about 10 millimoles of TiF4 or ZrF4per gram of solid oxide compound before calcining or contained on a precalcined solid oxide compound, preferably between about 0.1 and about 5 millimoles, and most preferably between 0.5 and 3.0 millimoles,<br>
When an impregnation process is utilized, the process comprises nrst calcining the solid oxide compound to remove moisture to produce a calcined solid oxide compound. Calcining was discussed previously in this disclosure. Secondly, TiF4 or ZrF4 is dissolved in any aprotic polar solvent, such as, for example, acetonitrile, carbon tetrachloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol alkoxidcs, -glymes,-and mixtures thereof, to produce a metal fluoride solution. The metal fluoride solution then is contacted with the calcined solid oxide compound to produce a metal fluoride/solid oxide compound mixture. Then, the aprotic polar solvent is evaporated from the metal fluoride/solid oxide compound mixture leaving the TiF4 or ZrF4 deposited on the solid oxide compound, thereby, producing the treated solid oxide compound. Optionally, for best results, the treated solid oxide compound can be dried thoroughly, even calcined up to a temperature in a range of about 300°C to about 500oC, to remove traces of the aprotic polar solvent.<br>
When a sublimation process is utilized to produce the treated solid oxide compound, the process comprises depositing TiF4 onto the solid oxide<br><br>
-16-<br>
campound by gas phase deposition. ZtF4 cannot be deposited by sublimation onto the solid oxide compound. In this process, TiF4 which sublimes at about 284°C at ambient pressure, is evaporated in the presence of the solid oxide compound and then condensed onto the solid oxide compound either through adsorption, or in some cases, through reaction with the solid oxide compound. Typically, the solid oxide compound is calcined to produce a calcined solid oxide compound. The calcined solid oxide compound is dry mixed with TiF4 to produce a TiF4/solid oxide compound mixture. The calcining of the solid oxide compound is conducted as discussed previously in this disclosure. This TiF4/soIid oxide compound mixture then is calcined at a temperature in a range of about 250 °C to about 600oC, preferably 300 °C to 500 °C. Generally, calcining time is in the range of about 1 minute to about 10 hours, preferably, 1 hour to 5 hours.<br>
The process of depositing TiF4 or ZrF4 by decomposition of a salt comprises impregnating the solid oxide compound with a solution comprising ammonium hexafluorotitanate ((NH4)2TLF6) or ammonium hexafluorozirconate ((NH4)ZrF6) and a solvent to produce an ammonium metal fluoride-containing solid oxide compound. The solvent is evaporated, and the ammonium metal fluoride-containing solid oxide compound is calcined at sufficiently high temperature to decompose the ammonium salt to TiF4 or ZrF4, thereby, releasing ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in the process to produce the treated solid oxide compound. In this embodiment, the solid oxide compound can be virgin or previously calcined as discussed previously in this disclosure. The solvent can be water or a polar organic solvent, such as, for example alcohol or acetone, The calcining of the ammonium metal fluoride-containing solid oxide compound is in a range of about 250° to 600o preferably 300 to 550oC,and over a time of one minute to 10 hours, preferably one to five hours.<br>
The catalyst compositions of this invention can be produced by contacting the organometal compound, the organoaluminum compound, and the solid, together. This contacting can occur in a variety of ways, such as, for example, blending. Furthermore, each of these compounds can be fed into a reactor separately, or various combinations of these compounds can be contacted together before being<br><br>
further contacted in the reactor, or all three compounds can be contacted together before being introduced into the reactor.<br>
Currently, one method is to first contact the organometal compound and the solid together, for about 1 minute to about 24 hours, preferably, 1 minute to I hour, at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C, preferably 15°C to S0°C, to form a first mixture, and then contact this first mixture with an organoaluminum compound to form the catalyst composition.<br>
Another method is to precontact the organometal compound, the organoaluminum compound, and the solid before injection into a polymerization reactor for about l minute to about 24 hours, preferably, 1 minute to 1 hour, at a temperature from about 10°C to about 200°C, preferably 20°C to 80°C.<br>
A weight ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the solid in the catalyst composition ranges from about 5: 1 to about 1:1000, preferably, from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and most preferably, from 1:1 to 1:50.<br>
A weight ratio of the solid to the organometal compound in the catalyst composition ranges from about 10,000:1 to about 1:1, preferably, from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and most preferably, from 250:1 to 20:1. These ratios are based on the amount of the components combined to give the catalyst composition.<br>
After contacting, the catalyst composition comprises a post-contacted organometal compound, a post-contacted organoaluminum compound, and a post-contacted solid. Preferably, the post-contacted solid is the majority, by weight, of the catalyst composition. Often times, specific components of a catalyst are not known, therefore, for this invention, the catalyst composition is described as comprising post-contacted compounds.<br>
A weight ratio of the post-contacted organoaluminum compound to the post-contacted solid in the catalyst composition ranges from about 5:1 to about 1:1000, preferably, from about 3:1 to about 1:100, and most preferably, from 1:1 to 1:50.<br>
A weight ratio of the post-contacted treated solid to the post-contacted organometal compound in the catalyst composition ranges from about 10,000:1 to about 1:1, preferably, from about 1000:1 to about 10:1, and most preferably, from 250:1 to 20:1. These ratios are based on the amount of the components combined to<br><br>

The activity of the catalyst composition of this invention is greater than about 50 grams of polymer per gram of solid per how, more preferably greater than about 75, and most preferably greater than 100. This activity is measured under slurry polymerization conditions, using isobutane as the diluent, and with a polymerization temperature of 90°C, and an ethylene pressure of 550 psig. The reactor should have substantially no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling.<br>
One of the important aspects of this invention is that no aluminoxane needs to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. Aluminoxane is an expensive compound that greatly increases polymer production costs, This also means that no water is needed to help form such aluminoxanes. This is beneficial because water can sometimes kill a polymerization process. Additionally, it should be noted that no fluoro organic borate compounds need to be used in order to form the catalyst composition. In summary, this means that the catalyst composition, which is heterogenous, and which can be used for polymerizing monomers, can be easily and inexpensively produced because of the substantial absence of any aluminoxane compounds or fluoro organic borate compounds. It should be noted that organo-chromium compounds and MgCl2 are not needed in order to form the catalyst composition. Although aluminoxane, fluoro organic borate compounds, organo-chromiun compounds, or MgCl2 are not needed in the preferred embodiments, these compounds can be used in other embodiments of this invention.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, a process comprising contacting at least one monomer and the catalyst composition to produce a polymer is provided. The term "polymer" as used in this disclosure includes homopolymers and copolymers. The catalyst composition can be used to polymerize at least one monomer to produce a homopolymer or a copolymer. Usually, homopolymers are comprised of monomer residues, having 2 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule, preferably 2 to about 10 carbon atoms per molecule. Currently, it is preferred when at least one monomer is selected from the group consisting of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butcne, 1-pentcne, 3 -methyl- 1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hcxene, 1-heptene, loctene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
-19-<br>
When a homopolymer is desired, it is most preferred to polymerize ethylene or propylene. When a copolymer is desired, the copolymer comprises monomer residues and one or more comonomer residues, each having from about 2 to about 20 carbon atoms per molecule. Suitable comonomers include, but are not limited to, aliphatic 1-olefins having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms per molecule, such as, for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyI-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene. and other olefins and conjugated or nonconjugated diolefins such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, piperylene, 2,3-dimeihyl-l,3-butadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,7-hexadiene, and other such diolefins and mixtures thereof. When a copolymer is desired, it is preferred to polymerize ethylene and at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexeno, 1-octene, and 1-decene. The amount of comonomer introduced into a reactor zone to produce ,a copolymer is generally from about 0.01 to about 10 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer, preferably, about 0.01 to about 5, and most preferably, 0.1 to 4. Alternatively, an amount sufficient to give the above described concentrations, by weight, in the copolymer produced can be used.<br>
Processes that can polymerize at least one monomer to produce a polymer are known in the art, such as, for example, slurry polymerization, gas phase polymerization, and solution polymerization. It is preferred to perform a slurry polymerization in a loop reaction zone. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization are well known in the art and include hydrocarbons which are liquid under reaction conditions. The term ."diluent" as used in this disclosure does not necessarily mean an inert material; it is possible that a diluent can contribute to polymerization. Suitable hydrocarbons include, but are not limited to, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, propane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Furthermore, it is most preferred to use isobutane as the diluent in a slurry polymerization. Examples of such technology can be found in U.S. Patents 4,424,341; 4,501,885; 4,613,484; 4,737,280; and 5,597,892.<br>
The catalyst compositions used in this process produce good quality polymer particles without substantially fouling the reactor. When the catalyst composition is to be used in a loop reactor zone under slurry polymerization<br><br>
-20-conditions, it is preferred when the particle size of the solid oxide compound is in the range of about 10 to about 1000 micrometers, preferably about 25 to about 500 micrometers, and most preferably, 50 to 200 micrometers, for best control during polymerization.<br>

Hydrogen can oe used with this invention in a polymerization process to control polymer molecular weight<br>
One of the features of this invention is that the T1F4, ZrF4, or treated solid oxide compound 19 itself an active catalyst for polymerization without the organometal compound, and it tends to produce very high molecular weight polymer relative to polymer produced by an organometal compound. Thus, when the TiF4 ZrF4, or the treated solid oxide compound is utilized with an organometal compound, it tends to produce bimodal polymers.<br>
After the polymers are produced, they can be formed into various articles, such as, for example, household containers and utensils, film products, drums, fuel tanks, pipes, geomembranes, and liners. Various processes can form these articles. Usually, additives and modifiers are added to the polymer in order to provide desired effects. It is believed that by using the invention described herein, articles can be produced ar a lower cost, while maintaining most, if not all, of the unique properties<br><br>

Test Methods A "Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Nitrogen Pore Size Distribution Instrument" was used to determined me specific surface area ("surface area") and specific pore volume ("pore volume") of the solid oxide compounds. This instrument was acquired from the Quantachrome Corporation, Syosset, N.Y.<br>
Melt Index (MI) in grams of polymer per ten minutes was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238, condition 190/2, at 190oC with a 2,160 gram weight. High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D123S, Condition 190/2.16, at 190°C with a 21,600 gram weight.<br>
Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions wore obtained using a Waters 150 CV gel permeation chromatograph with trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the solvent, with a flow rate of 1 milliliter/minute at a temperature of 140 °C. BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpheno!) at a concentration of 1.0 gram/liter was used as a stabilizer in the TCB. An injection volume of 220 microliters was used with a nominal polymer concentration of 0.3 gram/liter (at room temperature). Dissolution of the sample in stabilized TCB was carried out by heating at 160-170 ° C for 20 hours with occasional, gentle agitation. The column was two Waters HT-6E columns (7.8mm x 300mm). The columns were calibrated with a broad linear polyethylene standard (Phillips Marlex® BHB 5003) for which the molecular weight had been determined.<br>
Solid Oxids Compounds Silica was obtained from W.R.Grace, grade 952, having a pore volume of about 1.6 cc/g and a surface area of about 300 m2/g.<br>
Alumina sold as Ketjen grade B alumina was obtained from Akzo Nobel Chemical having a pore volume of about 1.78 cc/g and a surface area of about 350 m2/g.<br>
Silica-alumina was obtained from W.R. Grace as MS 13-110 containing 13% by weight alumina and 87% by weight silica. The silica-alumina had a pore volume of about 1.2 cc/g and a surface area of about 450 m4/g.<br><br>

Calcininc To calcine the solid oxide compound, about 10 grams were placed in a 1.75 inch quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the solid oxide compound was supported on the disk, air or nitrogen that had been dried by passing through a 13X molecular sieve column was blown up through the disk at a rate of about 1,6 to about 1,8 standard cubic feet per hour. An electric furnace around the quartz tube was then turned on, and the temperature was raised at the rate of 400°C per hour to the indicated temperature, typically 600 °C. At that temperature, the solid oxide compound was allowed to fluidize for three hours in the dry air. Afterward, the solid oxide compound was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, where it was protected from the atmosphere until ready for testing. It was never allowed to experience any exposure to the atmosphere.<br>
Polymerization Procedure Polymerization runs were made in a 2.2 liter steel reactor equipped with a marine stirrer running at 400 revolutions per minute (rpro). The reactor was surrounded by a steel jacket containing boiling methanol with a connection to a steel condenser. The boiling point of the methanol was controlled by varying nitrogen pressure applied to the condenser and jacket, which permitted precise temperature control to within half a degree celsius, with the help of electronic control instruments. Unless otherwise stated, a small amount (0.01 to 0.10 grams normally) of a test compound (TiF4, a solid oxide compound, or a treated solid oxide compound) was first charged under nitrogen to the dry reactor. Next, 2.0 milliliters of a toluene solution containing 0.5 percent by weight of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride was added, followed by 0.6 liter of isobutane liquid. Then, 1.0 milliliter of a 1.0 molar solution of triethyl aluminum in heptane (TEA) was added, followed by another 0.6 liter of isobutane liquid Then, the reactor was heated up to the specified temperature, typically 90°C, and finally ethylene was added to the reactor to equal a fixed pressure, generally 5S0 psig to produce a reaction mixture, The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for usually around one hour. As ethylene was consumed, more ethylene flowed in to maintain the pressure. The activity was noted by recording the flow of ethylene into the reactor to maintain the set pressure.<br><br>
-23-<br>
After the allotted time, the ethylene flow was stopped, and the reactor slowly depressurized and opened to recover s granular polymer. In all cases, the reactor was clean with no indication of any wall scale, coating or other forms of fouling. The polymer then was removed and weighed. Activity was specified as grams of polymer produced per gram of test compound charged per hour.<br>
Description of Results Specific, examples of this invention are described subsequently. The results of these polymerization tests are listed in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
INVENTIVE EXAMPLE1 Titanium Tetrafluoride In Example 1,0,1397 gram of anhydrous TiF4 obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company was charged to the reactor under nitrogen. Then, 2 milliliters of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride solution in heptane (0.5 wt%) was added to the reactor followed by 1 milliliter of 1 molar triemylaluminum solution in heptane. One liter of isobutane diluent was added. The temperature was heated up to 90°C, and ethylene was supplied on demand at 550 psig for 110 minutes. Afterward the reactor was depressurized, opened, and 16 grams of white polymer powder were recovered which yielded an activity of 62 grams of polymer per gram of TiF4 per hour. The polymer was found to have a melt index and a high load melt index of zero. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of thepolymer was found to be very high at 2,866,000 g/mol The number average molecular weight (Mn) was found to be 243,000, and the polydispersity (Mw/Mn) was found to be very broad at 15.9. The molecular weight distribution was distinctly bimodal, probably due to the two different active components in the catalyst composition, the organometal compound and TiF4. The GPC distribution is shown in Figure 1.<br>
CONTROL EXAMPLE 2 No titaninum tetrafluoride In Example 2, the same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated except mat the T1F4 was omitted. No polymer was produced.<br><br>
-24-<br>
INVENTIVE EXAMPLE 3 Sublimation of TiF4 onto Silica In Example 3,10 grams of silica described, previously were calcined in dry nitrogen at 400 °C for three hours to remove moisture to produce a calcined silica. Then, the calcined silica was cooled to room temperature and physically mixed, by vigorous stirring in the dry state, with 0.10 gram of TiF4 to produce a TiE4/solid oxide compound mixture. This TiF4/solid oxide compound mixture was then calcined again under nitrogen at 400 °C for another hour to redistribute the titanium tetrafluoride through sublimation to produce a treated solid oxide compound. Then, 0.2531 gram of the treated solid oxide compound was charged to the reactor along with the organometal compound and the triethylaluminum solution as in Example 1. In 91.5 minutes of polymerization, it produced 14 grams of polymer powder.<br>
CONTROL EXAMPLE 4 Silica In Example 4, the same silica used in Example 3, calcined at 60CoC, was charged to the reactor along with the organometal compound and diethyl-aluminum. It produced essentially no polymer.<br>
INVENTIVE EXAMPLES 5-6 Impregnation of TiF4 onto Alumina In Example 5,1,64 grams of TiF4 were dissolved in 50 milliliters of dry acetoflitrile (CH3CN) to produce a metal fluoride solution. Tins metal fluoride solution was then impregnated onto 9.6 grams of the alumina described previously, which had been calcined in dry nitrogen at 600°C for three hours. The metal fluoride solution was evaporated to dryness under flowing dry nitrogen with gentle warming to produce a dry powder. Then, the dry powder was dried further under flowing niu-ogen at 200 °C for one hour to produce a treated solid oxide compound. When tested for polymerization activity with the organometal compound and triemylaluminum as in the polymerization procedure discussed previously, the treated solid oxide compound produced 78 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. In Example 6, the treated solid oxide compound of Example 5 was further dried at 300°C for one hour to help further distribute the TiF4. When tested for<br><br>
-25-<br>
polymerization activity, it yielded an activity of 68 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour.<br>
CONTROL EXAMPLES 7-9 Alumina In  Examples 7-9, only the alumina, devoid of TiF4, was charged to the reactor with the orgauometat compound and triethylaluminum. The alumina had been calcined at 400oC, 600°C, and 800oC respectively, but as can be seen in Table I, activities derived from the alumina without TiF4 were slight to none.<br>
INVENTIVE EXAMPLES 10-16 Decomposition of Ammonium Hexafluorotitanate onto Silica In Example 10, silica was impregnated with an aqueous solution of ammonium hexafluorotitanate, (XH4TiF6, to incipient wetness to produce an ammonium titanium fluoride-containing silica. That is, each 10 grams of silica received 20 grams of an aqueous solution coutaining 5 millimoles of (NH4)2TiF6. The ammonium titanium fluoride-containing silica was then dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 100oC. A ten gram sample of the ammonium titanium fluoride-containing silica was then calcined under Cowing dry nitrogen at 250°C for three hours to evaporate ammonia to produce a treated solid oxide compound. When tested following the polymerization procedure used in Example 1, an activity of 156 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour was observed.<br>
In Examples 11 and 12, the treated solid oxide compound of Example 10 was calcined further under flowing nitrogen for three hours at 350°C and 4006-C respectively. Polymerization activity was found to be 79 and 155 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour, respectively.<br>
In Example 13, the same procedure of Example 10 was repeated, except that 2.0 millimoles of ammonium hexafluorotitanate per gram of silica were impregnated onto the silica to produce a treated solid oxide compound. After calcining at 250°C, it yielded an activity of 107 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. In Examples 14, 15, and 16, the treated solid oxide compound was calcined at higher temperatures, 350°C, 450oC, and 550oC respectively, yielding activities of 5, 94, and 140 grams of polymer per gram of treated<br><br>
-26-solid oxide compound per hour.<br>
INVENTIVE EXAMPLES 17-23 Decomposition of Ammonium Hexafluorozirconate onto gilica<br>
In Example 17, the same procedure of Example 10 was repeated, except that ammonium hexafluorozirconate ((NH4)2ZrF6)was used instead of ammonium hexafluorotitanate to produce an ammonium zirconium fluoride-containing silica. 0.4 millimole of (NH4)2ZrF6) was impregnated per gram of silica. The ammonium zirconium fluoride-containing silica then was calcined in dry nitrogen at 250° for one hour to produce a treated solid oxide compound. The treated solid oxide compound was tested for polymerization activity and yielded 666 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. In Eamples 18 and 19, the treated solid oxide compound was calcined at 350° and 400°. Activities of 168 and 77 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound were obtained respectively.<br>
In Eample 20, the amount of ammonium hexafluorozirconate was increased to 1.9 millimoles impregnated per gram of silica, After being calcined at 250° for one hour, the treated solid oxide compound yielded an activity of 236 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. In Examples 21,22, and 23, the treated solid oxide compound in Example 20 was calcined at 350o, 450% and 550 °, and activities of 105,217, and 193 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour respectively were observed.<br>
INVENTTVE EXAMPLES 24-25 AND CONTROL EXAMPLE 26 Sublimation of TiF4 onto Silica-Alumina In Example 24, the sublimation procedure of Example 3 was repeated except that a sibca-alumina was used instead of silica. The silica-alumina had been previously calcined in dry nitrogen for three hours at 500 oC to remove moisture to produce a calcined silica-alumina. The calcined silica-alumina was then cooled and dry mixed with 11% of its own weight of tiumium tetrafluoride and calcined again at 500oC for one hour to produce a treated solid oxide compound. When tested for polymerization activity per the polymerization procedure discussed previously, the treated soUd oxide compound material yielded an activity of 8148 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. In Example 25, the treated solid<br><br>
-27-<br>
oxide compound was tested again and yielded sn activity of 8202 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound per hour. These results are shown in Table 2.<br>
The polymer of Example 24 was found to have a melt index of 0.116 grams/10 minutes and a high load melt index of 2.80 grams/10 minutes giving a shear ratio (HLMI/MI) of 24,2. This is considerably broader (higher) than usually obtained from polymer produced by this organometal compound when activated by other compounds, such as MAO, which generally yields a shear ratio of 16. The higher shear ratio is probably the result of a contribution to the activity from two sources of polymerization sites. The main contribution comes from the organometal compound, but another, higher molecular weight source of activity comes from the TiF4 itself. To demonstrate this, the treated solid oxide compound was tested again in Example 26 except that the organometal compound was omitted. The treated solid oxide compound still yielded an activity of 67 grams of polymer per gram of treated solid oxide compound, indicating an inherent activity of its own. The polymer produced by the treated solid oxide compound was found to have zero melt index and zero high load melt index.<br>
CONTROL EXAMPLES 27 AND 2S Silica-Alumina In Examples 27 and 28, the procedure of Example 24 was repeated with the same silica-alumina, except containing no TiF4 After being calcined at 350° C and 600°C respectively, it yielded an activity of only 3 and 32 grams of polymer per gram of silica-alumina per hour activity indicating that the TiF4 is necessary for higher activity.<br>
Control Examples 29-31 Ftuorided Silica-Alumina Finally in Examples 29, 30, and 31, other fluoriding agents were also impregnated onto the silica-alumina for comparison. In Example 29, 1-75 millimoies of ammonium bifluoride were impregnated per gram of silica-alumina, followed by calcining at 500°C. In Example 30,1.0 millimole of ammonium hexafluorosilicate per gram of silica-alumina was impregnated followed by calcining at 480°C. In Example<br><br>
-28-<br>
31, 1.60 millimoles of ammonium fluoroborate per gram of silica-alumina were impregnated followed by calcining at 480°C. Although these three treatments succeeded in producing good activity, the shear ratio was unfortunately narrow (lower) in each case, as shown in Table 2.<br><br>
