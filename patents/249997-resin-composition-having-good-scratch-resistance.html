THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a scratch resistant resin composition. More par¬ticularly, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition having good scratch resistance, colorability, gloss, weatherability and impact resistance by blending a graft resin having a double shell structure and a resin containing (meth) acrylic acid alkyl esters.<br>
Background Art<br>
In general, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene graft copolymer resin (hereinafter, ABS resin) has good impact resistance, processability, mechanical strength, heat distortion temperature and gloss. Therefore, the resin has been widely used in the manufacture of electric or electronic goods, office automation (OA) instruments, and so forth. However, the ABS resins used in the housings of electronic products such as.LCD, PDP TV, Audio, etc., tend to show scratches as a result of injection molding or during normal usage. Further, it is difficult to impart an elegant color to the ABS resin, which decreases its commercial value.<br>
To avoid this problem, the surface of the molded ABS resin article is coated with urethane or UV or scratch-resistant acryl. However, these coating methods require post-processing treatments, and hence complicate the operation and incur a high defect rate, making productivity low. Further, these coating methods give rise to a problem of environmental contamination. Therefore there remains a need for a scratch resistant resin having improved gloss and impact resistance and which can be easily injection molded.<br>
It is necessary for a scratch resistant resin to have colorability and high gloss, because this resin unlike conventional ABS resin does not proceed with a urethane coating on the molded article. Conventional ABS resin does not have sufficient scratch resistance even though it is coated with urethane.<br>
Acryl resin, PMMA resin, etc., having good colorability and gloss are typically employed as a scratch resistant material which does not require a urethane coating. However, PMMA resin has the disadvantages of poor impact resistance and in¬sufficient moldability, thereby causing difficulty in injection molding. Therefore, this material is generally molded as an extrusion sheet, and attached to a molded article. However, this method incurs high costs and high defect rates due to post-processing.<br>
2<br><br>
Besides PMMA resin, methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin (g-MABS or so-called "transparent ABS resin") can be used as a scratch resistant material. Although the transparent ABS resin has good colorability, gloss, and impact resistance, it does not have sufficient scratch properties such as R-hardness and flexural modulus. Accordingly, warping or bending may occur during molding processes due to insufficient strength.<br>
Further, an ABS/PMMA alloy has poor colorability and does not exhibit sufficient scratch resistance, although it has good impact resistance.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have developed a resin composition having good scratch resistance as well as a good balance of physical properties by blending a graft resin having a double shell structure and a resin containing (meth) acrylic acid alkyl esters.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a resin composition having good scratch resistance.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a resin composition having a good balance of colorability, weatherability, gloss, and impact resistance physical properties.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a resin composition having a good balance of physical properties without requiring a post-processing treatment such as a UV coating, an acryl resin film coating, etc.<br>
Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the ensuing disclosure and appended claims.<br>

After 10 minutes from the time of reaching 60°C, a redox catalyst comprising 0.005 parts by weight of ferrous sulfate and 0.3 parts by weight of sodium pyrophosphate dissolved in water is added thereto to initiate graft polymerization. The temperature of the reactor is maintained at 70°C for 60 minutes. The polymerization is carried out at 70°C for an additional 30 minutes to give an inner shell layer. After completion of the polymerization of the inner shell layer, 0.6 parts by weight of potassium persulfate is added. Then, a mixture comprising 33.23 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 0.3 parts by weight of t-dodecyl mercaptane is added to the reactor continuously over a period of 3 hours to conduct the poly¬merization reaction. After completion of the addition, the polymerization reaction is continued for an additional 60 minutes. The reaction is cooled to 60°C and 1 part by weight of M497 (manufactured by CHUKYO YUSHI CO., LTD) as an antioxidant is added to obtain a graft copolymer (g-MABS) latex having a double shell structure in which an inner shell is surrounded by methyl methacrylate. The graft ratio of the graft copolymer (g-MABS) latex is 58 %. The graft latex is coagulated with an aqueous solution comprising 1 % magnesium sulfate and 1 % sulfuric acid, washed, dehydrated and dried to yield a graft copolymer in the form of white powder containing less than 1 % water.<br>

13<br><br>
Comparative Examples are measured as follows and the results are shown in Table 1<br>
and 2:<br>
(1)	Light Transmissivity of g-MABS: The light transmissivity of the g-MABS prepared from Examples 1~5 is evaluated as total light transmittance using a color computer manufactured by SUGA INSTRUMENT Co., Ltd. of Japan. The total light transmittance (%) is calculated from the following formula: total light transmittance (%) = (light transmitted at all forward angles/ incident light) x 100.<br>
(2)	Pencil Hardness: The pencil hardness was measured by applying 500 g load 5 times to a surface of a test sample having a size of 3 mm (thickness) x 10 mm (length) x 6 mm (width) according to JIS (lapanese Industry Standard) K5401 at 23°C. The surface of the sample is visually checked for scratches. If scratches are observed in two or more, the test is repeated with a pencil of one grade lower hardness. The results were classified into 4B-7H.<br>
(3)	R- Hardness: The Rockwell Hardness is measured in accordance with ASTM D785.<br>
(4)	Gloss: The gloss is measured in accordance with ASTM D523 (%).<br>
(5)	Flexural modulus and Tensile strength: The flexural modulus is measured in accordance with ASTM D790 (kgf/cm ), and the tensile strength is measured in accordance with ASTM D638 (kgf/cm ).<br>
(6)	Notch Izod Impact Strength: The notch Izod impact strength is measured in accordance with ASTM D256 (1/8 inch, kgf-m/cm).<br>
(7)	Colorability: The values of AL and Ab are measured by means of a spec¬trophotometer. The standard is the ABS resin obtained from Comparative Example 4. If AL is negative, this means that the sample is lighter than the standard. Ab defines the difference as a blue/yellow value. If Ab is negative, the sample is more blue, which means good colorability.<br>
(8)	Weatherability: The weatherability is measured in accordance with ASTM D4329 and evaluated by Delta E after UV radiation for 100 hours.<br>
(9)	Flowability: The melt flow index is measured in accordance with ISO 1103 under conditions of 220°C and an applied mass of 10 kg (g/10min).<br>

As shown in Table 2, Comparative Example 1 using only PMMA resin exhibits poor impact resistance and injection moldability, although it has good scratch properties such as pencil hardness and R-hardness, gloss, colorability, and weatherability. Comparative Examples 2 and 3 in which MS resin contains methyl-methacrylate in an amount of less than 40 % exhibit insufficient R-hardness and pencil hardness, and colorability. Further, the weatherability and the colorability are de¬teriorated. Comparative Example 4 in which ABS resin is used alone exhibits poor pencil hardness, colorability and weatherability. Comparative Example 5 in which an ABS / PMMA alloy is used exhibits deteriorated impact resistance and colorability. On<br>
15<br><br>
the other hand, Examples 6-14 in which g-MABS and acryl resin alloy are used exhibit an excellent balance of pencil hardness, R-hardness, colorability, weatherability, impact strength, flowability, tensile strength and flexural modulus physical properties.<br>
