[Title  of  the  Invention]     AIR  CLEANER  STRUCTURE OF MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement of an air cleaner structure of a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
An air cleaner structure of a motorcycle which is disposed between left and right leg shields have been known in the related art {e.g. see Patent Document 1)<br>
[Patent Document 1]  JP-A No. 2003-320977 [00031<br>
Figs. 4 to 6 and 8 of Patent Document 1 are described hereafter.<br>
An air cleaner 18 (see paragraph [0014] in the specification) is disposed between left and right leg shields 33, 33, and each inner shield 40 is attached to inner side of each of the leg shields 33, 33. Further, the inner shield 40 is attached to the main body frame by each main pipe side cover 32 and inner shields 40, 4 0 at the left and right are disposed around an opening at the front of the main body. [0004]<br>
The inner shields 40, 4 0 reduce the open area of the upper portion of the opening at the front of the main body. Therefore, the flow velocity of the running wind flowing inside through the opening is decreased and the amount of air sucked by the air cleaner 18 is increased by attaching the inner shields 40, 40.<br><br>
[Disclosure of  the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the  Invention]<br>
[0005]<br>
However, installing the leg shields 33, 33, the main pipe side covers 32, 32, and the inner shields 40, 40 to form a cover at the front of the main body increases the number of parts and mal<:es the attachm.ent difficult thereby increasing cost.></:es>
An object of the invention is to provide an air cleaner structure of a motorcycle that is easy to be attached and reduces the cost while ensuring the amount of intake air of an air cleaner without increasing the number of parts of a motorcycle.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
[oooe]<br>
According to the invention in claim 1, there is provided an air cleaner structure of a motorcycle including a pair of left and right leg shields disposed in front of each rider's leg and an air cleaner disposed between the leg shields, characterized in that an opening part through which a running wind is taken inside the left and right leg shields is formed at the front ends of the left and right leg shields, and the air cleaner has a baffle plate reducing the flow velocity of the running wind at both left and right sidewalls, and the baffle plate extends outside in a width direction of the motorcycle further than the opening part.<br>
[0007]<br>
In the operation, since the baffle plate disposed at both left and right sidewalls of the air cleaner extends outside in the width direction of the motorcycle further than the opening part of the leg shields, gaps between the baffle plate and the<br><br>
leg shields are decreased and the channel for the running wind is bent, such that the flow direction of the running wind changes and the flow velocity of the running wind taken inside the leg shield is reduced. Accordingly, air can be easily sucked into the air cleaner.<br>
Further, by the baffle plate of the air cleaner, an inner shield as in the related art is not needed. [0008]<br>
The invention in claim 2 is characterized in that each engagement hole is formed in the baffle plate and each engagement pawl that is engaged with the engagement hole is formed on each of the leg shields.<br>
In the operation, the baffle plate supports the leg shields by engaging the engagement pawls of the leg shields with the engagement holes of the baffle plate. Therefore, it is possible to remove a specific supporting member for supporting the leg shields or a fastener member for fastening the supporting member to the leg shields.<br>
Further, the engagement pawls of the leg shields can be easily engaged with the engagement holes of the baffle plate. [0009]<br>
The invention in claim 3 is characterized in that the baffle plate has a stepped portion formed by bending a portion of the baffle plate.<br>
In the operation, rigidity of the baffle plate is increased by the stepped portion and the leg shields are strongly supported by the high-rigidity baffle plate. [Effects of the Invention]<br><br>
[0010]<br>
In the invention according to claim 1, the opening part through which a running wind is taken inside the left and right leg shields is formed at the front ends of the left and right leg shields, the baffle plate reducing the flow velocity of the running wind is formed at both left and right sidewalls of the air cleaner, and the baffle plate extends outside in the width direction of the motorcycle further than the opening part. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the flow velocity of the running wind taken inside the leg shields through the opening part and ensure the amount of intake air of the air cleaner. Accordingly, it is possible to remove an inner shield disposed inside of the leg shield in the related art and reduce the number of parts. Therefore, it is possible to reduce cost of the motorcycle. [0011]<br>
In the invention according to claim 2, since the engagement holes are formed in the baffle plate and the engagement pawls that are engaged with the engagement holes are formed in the leg shields, it is possible to support the leg shields with the baffle plate by engaging the engagement pawls of the leg shields with the engagement holes of the baffle plate. It is possible to reduce the number of parts, cost, and weight as compared with particularly providing supporting members supporting the leg shields or providing fastener members fastening the supporting members to the leg shields.<br>
Further, since the engagement pawls are just engaged with the engagement holes, it is possible to improve assemblability.<br><br>
[0012]<br>
In the invention according to claim 3, since the baffle plate has a stepped portion formed by bending a portion of the baffle plate, it is possible to increase rigidity of the baffle plate of the air cleaner, strongly support the leg shields, and prevent resonance of the leg shields.<br>

Further, reference numeral ^112a' represents a ring-shaped groove formed, around the opening of the cover main chamber 131, in the abutting face 112b with the air cleaner case body 111 (see Fig. 3). [0028]<br>
The cover main chamber 131 has main chamber-bulged portions 131A, 131B that are bulged upward and positioned outside the cover sub-chambers 132, 13 3 at the upper left and right sides.<br>
The imaginary lines in the drawing represent the left and right upper edges lllx. Illy of the air cleaner case  body 111 and the body sub-chambers 127, 128. [0029]<br>
The upper portions of the upper edges lllz, Illy of the cover sub-frame 132, 133 form the intalte ports 64A, 64b of the air cleaner 64, which are exposed to the outside in the rear direction of the motorcycle. Since the body sub-chamber 127 is disposed across the cover sub-chamber 132 and the main chamber-bulged portion 131A, such that the cover sub-chamber 132 are communicated with the main chamber-bulged portion 131A. Further, since the body sub-chamber 128 is disposed across the cover sub-<br><br>
chamber 133 and the main chamber-bulged portion 131B, the cover sub-chamber 133 is communicated with the main chaitiber-bulged portion 131B.<br>
That is, intake channels 64C, 64D from the intake ports 64A, 64B to the cover main chamber 131 are formed by the cover sub-chambers 132, 133 and the body sub-chambers 127, 128. [0030]<br>
Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view showing the air cleaner case cover according to the invention. The air cleaner case cover 112 has the intake ports 64A, 64B at the upper portion on the rear surface (the rear one ^64B' only shown) . Further, reference numeral ^112d' represents a drain hole for discharging oil and water remaining inside the cover main chamber 131. [0031]<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 8-8 shown in Fig. 2, in which the air cleaner 64 is disposed between the left and right main frame side covers 37, 38, and the baffle plate llld mounted to the air cleaner 64, in detail, the left protrusion lllr and the right protrusion Ills, which protrude to the left and right, protrude outside in the width direction of the motorcycle further than the front ends 37a, 38a forming the opening part 106 of the main frame side covers 37, 38. Rererence numerals ^141, 142' in the drawing represent straight lines extending in the back and forth direction of the motorcycle through the front ends 3 7a, 3 8a. [0032]<br>
As described above, by extending the baffle plate llld of the air cleaner 64 further than the width of the opening part 106<br><br>
to the outside in the width direction of the motorcycle, it is possible to reduce the gaps 144, 145 in the width direction of the motorcycle between the baffle plate llld and the inner surfaces of the main frame side covers 37, 38 and bend the left and right air channel 146, 147 from the opening part 106 to the rear portion of the air cleaner 64.  Further, it is possible to change the flow direction of the running wind taken from the opening part 106 and decrease the flow velocity of the running wind. [0033]<br>
As shown in Figs. 6 to 8, since the intake ports 64A, 64B of the air cleaner 64 are formed in the upper portion on the rear surface of the air cleaner 64, it is possible to reduce pressure drop at the rear portion of the air cleaner 64 by decreasing the flow velocity of the running wind taken from the opening part 106 as described above. Accordingly, air can be easily sucked into the intake ports 64A, 64B from the rear portion of the air cleaner 64, such that it is possible to increase the amount of intake air to the air cleaner 64 and ensure the necessary amount of intake air. [0034]<br>
Fig. 9 is a cross-sectional view showing the air cleaner and the periphery thereof according to the invention, which shows a cross section cut along a vertical plan extending in the width direction of the motorcycle, and seen from the front of the motorcycle (cross-sectional view taken along the line 9-9 shown in Fig. 1). [0035]<br><br>
The stepped portion lllh formed on the baffle plate llld extending left and right from the air cleaner 64, in detail, the left stepped portion lllp and the right stepped portion lllq each formed with an engagement hole lllv longitudinally opened and the lower ends of the left and right main frame side covers 37, 38 have engagement protrusions 37c, 38c extending downward, such that the engagement protrusions 3 7c, 3Be are inserted in and engaged with the engagement holes lllv, lllv. [0036]<br>
As described above, since the engagement protrusions 37c, 3 8c are engaged with the engagement holes lllv, lllv, it is possible to support the lower ends of the main frame side covers 37, 38 by using the air cleaner 64, such that a supporting member for supporting the lower ends of the main frame side covers 37, 3 8 is not particularly needed. Further, the engagement prevents resonance of the main frame side covers 37, 38. Furthermore, since the engagement holes lllv, lllv are formed in the left stepped portion lllp and the right stepped portion lllq of the high-rigidity stepped portion lllh, it is possible to strongly support the lower ends of the main frame side covers 37, 38 and further prevent resonance of the main frame side covers 37, 38.<br>
Further, it is possible to improve the aesthetic appearance of the sides of the main body by covering the engagement portion of the engagement protrusions 3 7c, 38c with the engagement holes lllv, lllv with the lower covers 43, 44. [0037]<br>

Further, reference numeral 3 6q represents a switch insertion hole in which a main switch is inserted, reference numeral '36r' represents a slit-shaped opening, and reference numeral ^36s' represents a main body attachment hole for attaching the rear center of the main frame cover 3 6 to the main body frame 11 (see Fig. 1).<br><br>
[0042]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 8,   in a motorcycle 10 including the main frame side covers 37, 38, the lower covers 43, 44, which function as a pair of left and right leg shields disposed in front of the rider's legs, and the air cleaner £4 disposed between the leg shields, that is, between the left and right main frame side covers 37, 38 and the left and right lower covers 43, 44, the opening part 106 through which a running wind is taken into the left and right leg shields is disposed at the front of the left and right leg shields, the baffle plate llld reducing the flow velocity of the running wind is disposed at the left and right side walls Ilia, 111b of the air cleaner 64, and the baffle plate llld extends outside in the width direction of the motorcycle further than the opening part 106. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the flow velocity of the running wind taken into the leg shields from the opening part 106 and ensure the amount of intake air of the air cleaner 64. Further, it is possible to remove an inner shield disposed in the leg shield in the related art and reduce the number of parts. Therefore, it is possible to reduce cost of the motorcycle 10. [0043]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 9,   since the engagement holes lllv, lllv are formed in the baffle plate llld and the engagement pawls 37c, 38c that are engaged with the engagement holes lllv, lllv are formed on the leg shields, it is possible to support the leg shields to the baffle plate llld by engaging the engagement pawls 3 7c, 38c of the leg shields with the engagement holes lllv, lllv of the baffle plate llld. It is possible to reduce the<br><br>
number of parts, cost, and weight as compared with particularly providing supporting members supporting the leg shields or providing fastener members fastening the supporting members to the leg shields.<br>
Further, since the engagement pawls 37c, 38c are just engaged with the engagement holes lllv, lllv, it is possible to improve assemblability. [0044]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 4, since the baffle plate llld is formed with the stepped portion lllh by bending a portion of the baffle plate, it is possible to increase rigidity of the baffle plate llld of the air cleaner 64, strongly support the leg shields, and prevent resonance of the leg shields. [0045]<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 8, although the baffle plate llld extends outside in the width direction of the motorcycle from the air cleaner 64, the baffle plate may extend inside from the inner surfaces of the left and right main frame side covers 37, 38 in the width direction of the motorcycle.
