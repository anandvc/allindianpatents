Improvements in or related to organic compounds<br>
This invention relates to alkylsulfanyl-benzenes, and in particular those having spicy and anisic odour notes, a method of producing the same and to flavour and fragrance compositions containing one or more of these compounds.<br>
Compounds having spicy and anisic odour notes are of interest in the flavour and fragrance industry.<br>
However, certain molecules, e.g. eugenol and anethole, despite having these interesting odour notes have the disadvantage that they discolour on storage, and therefore their use is usually limited to certain applications where discoloration is not a problem or can be masked.<br>
Structural modification of these molecules, however, either results in a failure to retain the spicy and anisic odourant properties or the odourant properties are retained but they are far less intense and rich.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need to provide molecules that do not possess the disadvantages of the prior art molecules but which retain their spicy and anisic odour notes and are diffusive and substantive.<br>
It has now be found that certain compounds can be developed that are stable to discolouration and yet are substantive, diffusive and possess the desirable spicy and anisic odour notes.<br><br><br>
i)  the bond between C1and C2 is a single bond; R1 is methyl, ethyl,i-propyl, n-propyl; R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen or methyl; or<br>
R2 and R3 taken together is a divalent radical (CH2)n, C(CH3)2, or CH(CH3) which forms a cycloalkane ring together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached; R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen or methyl; or R4 and R5 taken together is a divalent radical (CH2)n, (CH2)n.1CH(CH3)2, or (CH2)n.1CH(CH3) which forms a cycloalkane ring together with the carbon atoms to which it is attached; n is an integer of 1, 2, 3, or 4; and wherein at least one cycloalkane ring is present; or<br>
ii) the bond between C1 and C2 together with the dotted line represents a double bond; R1 is methyl, ethyl,i-propyl, n-propyl; R2 is hydrogen or methyl; R3 and R4 together is hydrogen or methyl; and R5 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl,i-propyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, ferf-butyl or sec-butyl.<br>
The compounds of formula I may comprise one or more a chiral centres and as such may exist as a mixture of stereoisomers, or they may be resolved as isomerically pure forms. Resolving stereoisomers adds to the complexity of manufacture and purification of these compounds, and so it is preferred to use the compounds as mixtures of their stereoisomers simply for economic reasons. However, if it is desired to prepare individual stereoisomers, this may be achieved according to methodology known in the art, e.g. preparative HPLC and GC or by stereoselective syntheses.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C1 and C2 is a single bond are 1-cyclopropylmethyl-4-methylsulfanyl-benzene, 1-cyclobutylmethyl-4-methylsulfanyl-benzene, 1-cyclopentylmethyl-4-methylsulfanyl-benzene and 1-cyclohexylmethyl-4methylsulfanyl-benzene.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of formula I wherein the bond between C1 and C2 together with the dotted line is a double bond are 1-prop-1-enyl-4-methylsulfanyl-benzene and 1-hex-1-enyl-4-methylsulfanyl-benzene.<br>
30062 PCT/04.05.05<br><br>
Compounds of formula I may be used alone or as a mixture to form a fragrance composition, which composition forms another aspect of the present invention. In addition, the compounds may be used in combination with other known flavourant or odourant molecules selected from the extensive range of natural and synthetic molecules currently available and/or in admixture with one or more ingredients or excipients conventionally used in conjugation with odourants or flavourants in fragrance or flavour compositions.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be combined with a wide range of known odorants to create interesting odor notes. The following non-limiting list comprises examples of known odourant molecules which may be combined with the compounds of the present<br>
invention:<br>
natural products: tree moss absolute, basil oil, tropical fruit oils (such as bergamot oil, mandarin oil, etc.), mastix absolute, myrtle oil, palmarosa oil, patchouli oil, petitgrain oil, wormwood oil, lavender oil, rose oil, jasmin oil, ylang-ylang oil.<br>
alcohols: farnesol, geraniol, linalool, nerol, phenylethyl alcohol, rhodinol, cinnamic alcohol, (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol, menthol, a-terpineol.<br>
aldehydes: citral, α-hexyl cinnamaldehyde, Lilial, methylionone, verbenone, nootkatone, geranylacetone.<br>
esters: allyl phenoxyacetate, benzyl salicylate, cinnamyl propionate, citronellyl acetate, decyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl acetate, dimethylbenzylcarbinyl butyrate, ethyl acetoacetate, cis-3-hexenyl isobutyrate, cis-3-hexenyl salicylate, linalyl acetate, methyl dihydrojasmonate, styralyl propionate, vetineryl acetate, benzyl acetate, geranyl acetate.<br><br><br>
other components often used in perfumery: indole, p-mentha-8-thiol-3-one, methyleugenol, eugenol, anethol.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used neat and simply admixed to form compositions. Alternatively or additionally however, they may be entrapped with entrapment materials, for example, polymers, capsules, microcapsules and nanocapsules. liposomes, film formers, absorbents such as carbon or zeolites, cyclic oligosaccharides and mixtures thereof, or they may be chemically bound to substrates which are adapted to release the compound of formula I upon application of an exogenous stimulus such as light, enzyme, or the like, and these entrapped forms may be used in compositions of the present invention.<br>
The compositions may optionally comprise other excipients well known in the art, including anti-foaming agents, anti-oxidant agents, binders, colourants, diluents,  disintegrants, emulsifiers, enzymes, fats, flavour-enhancers, flavouring agents, gums, lubricants, polysaccharides, preservatives, proteins, solubilisers, solvents, stabilisers, sugar-derivatives, surfactants, sweetening agents, vitamins, waxes, and the like. Solvents which may be used are known to those skilfed in the art and include e.g. ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, triacetin, diethyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate.<br>
Examples of absorbents, entrapment materials, excipients, diluents or solvents for flavour or fragrance applications may be found e.g. in ..Perfume and Flavor Materials of Natural Origin,,, S. Arctander, Ed., Elizabeth, N.J., 1960; in "Perfume and Flavor Chemicals", S. Arctander, Ed., Vol. I &amp; II, Allured Publishing Corporation, Carol Stream, USA, 1994; in "Flavourings", E. Ziegler and H. Ziegler (ed.), Wiley-VCH Weinheim, 1998, and "CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook", J.M. Nikitakis (ed.), 1st ed., The Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, Inc., Washington, 1988.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be used in fragrance applications, e.g. in any field of fine and functional perfumery, such as perfumes, household products, laundry products, body care products and cosmetics. The high diffusion and substantivity of compounds according to the present invention are well perceived on fabrics washed with detergent or treated with a softener comprising them. The typical<br><br>
spicy anisic odour is already perceived on wet fabric and lingers for long periods, e.g. 2 -4 days on dry fabric.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be used in flavour applications and are useful in modifying for example, spicy flavours and seasonings for condiments and meats. They may be used in aromatic, herbal and spicy flavourings, heavy fruit flavours (e.g. raisin, prune) and in flavours for root beer. The compounds are also well suited for mouthwash applications.<br>
In flavourant applications, the compounds of the formula I may be present in compositions in amounts ranging from 0.001 to 1000 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.05 to 500 mg/kg.<br>
When used in fragrance applications, compounds of the formula I can be employed in widely ranging amounts depending upon the specific application, for example, from about 0.001 to about 10 weight percent. One application may be a fabric softener comprising about 0.001 to 0.05 weight percent. Another application may be an alcoholic solution comprising about 0.1 to 10 weight percent. The preferred concentrations vary between about 0.1 and 5 weight percent. However, the values are not limiting on the present invention, since the experienced perfumer may also achieve effects with even lower concentrations or may create novel accords with even higher amounts.<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I may be synthesised from commonly-available starting materials and reagents according to synthetic protocols known in the art. Benzene-(4-alkylsulfanyl-cycloalkyl) compounds of formula I (i.e. R2 and R3 forms a cycloalkane ring together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached) may be synthesised from the corresponding 4-alkylsulfanyl-phenyl carbonyl compound, e.g. 4-methylsulfanyl-benzaldehyde, under Wittig reaction conditions, followed by cycloalkylation of the intermediate alkylsulfanyl alkenyl benzene, e.g. 1-methylsulfanyl-4-propenyl-benzene, under Simmons-Smith reaction conditions, well known in the art.<br>
Benzene-(4-alkylsulfanyl-cycloalkyl-methyl) compounds of formula I (i.e. R4and R5 forms a cycloalkane ring together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached) may be synthesised from the corresponding 4-alkylsulfanyl-benzene, e.g. thioanisol (C5H5SCH3), and the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride, e.g. cyclopropanecarboxylic acid chloride, followed by reduction of the intermediate ketone, e.g. cyclopropyl-(4-methylsulfanyl-phenyl)-methanone, under Wolff-Kishner reaction conditions well known in the art.<br><br>
