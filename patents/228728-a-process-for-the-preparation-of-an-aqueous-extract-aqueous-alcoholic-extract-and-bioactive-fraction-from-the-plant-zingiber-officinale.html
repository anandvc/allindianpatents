Background and prior art references<br>
Ginger of commerce or 'Adrak' is the dried underground stem or rhizome of the zingiberous, herbaceous plant Zingiber officinale Linn, which constitutes one of the five most important major spices of India, standing 3rd or 4th, competing with chillies, depending upon fluctuations in world market prices and world demand and supply positions. Ginger ranks third in value among all the spices exported from India, being next to pepper and cardamom. Indian ginger is further classified as (i) Malabar ginger (Kerala), (ii) Cochin ginger or Wyanad ginger (iii) Himachal ginger, and   (iv) Sikkim/N.E. region ginger.<br>
Ginger is valued in medicine as a carminative and stimulant to the gastro-intestinal tract. It is much in vogue as a household remedy for flatulence and colic. Externally, ginger is used as a local stimulant and rubefacient. It is included among anti-depressants and it forms an ingredient of some anti-narcotic preparations. Besides its stimulant and carminative properties, it is used in toothaches, gout and rheumatism. The essence of ginger is used to promote digestion. Ginger is reported to act powerfully on the mucous membrane. Beneficial results have been obtained when it has been administered in pulmonary and catarrhal affections. Externally, ginger has been used as curative for headaches, paralysis and rheumatism and internally with other ingredients in intermittent fevers (Wealth of India, Raw Material vol XI (1976), 89, PID, CSIR, New Delhi).<br>
Based on our past experience with the development of piperine as bioavailability enhancer from plants which are part of human diet as well as being medicinal, we took up this plant to evaluate its bioavailability enhancing effect, if any, based on its attributes bearing some similarities to the plant sources of piperine.<br><br>
Several approaches have been adopted in the past to maximize oral<br>
bioavailability, such as (a) particle size reduction (micronization, nanonization, etc.,)<br>
(b) polymorphic or crystal size and form selection, (c) solubilization of lesser soluble<br>
drugs by way of chemical modifications, complexation and use of co-solvents/<br>
surfactants, (d) targeted delivery of drug at the site of action, (e) controlled drug<br>
delivery by film coating or use of polymeric matrices for sustained release of drugs,<br>
(f) prodrug approach, and (g) microencapsulation using liposomes.<br>
However, based on information from Ayurvedic literatures, a new approach of<br>
increasing the bioavailability of drugs including poorly bioavailable drugs had been<br>
conceptualized at RRL. Jammu. One of the groups of herbals which has been<br>
documented very frequently as essential part of about 70 % of Ayurvedic<br>
prescriptions, was noted to be Trikatu', that comprises three acrids viz. long pepper,<br>
black pepper and dry ginger in equal proportions. A single major alkaloidal<br>
constituent from peppers (piperine) was found to be responsible for bioavailability<br>
enhancing effect. The role of ginger is to regulate intestinal function to facilitate<br>
absorption. Influence of piperine was extensively studied on anti-TB drugs. It was<br>
determined that in combination with piperine the dose of rifampicin can be reduced<br>
by about 50% while retaining the therapeutic efficacy of this anti-TB drug at par with<br>
the standard dose (450 mg). Based on these findings several other reputed plants were<br>
evaluated for bioavailability/ bioefficacy enhancing activity. Polar and non-polar<br>
extracts of parts of a few plants viz., Cuminum cyminum and Carum carvi increased<br>
significantly (25 - 435 %), the bioavailability of a number of classes of drugs, for<br>
example, but not limited to, antibiotics, antifungals, anti-virals, anticancer,<br>
cardiovascular, CNS, anti-inflammatory/anti-arthritic, anti-TB/ antileprosy, antihistaminic/<br>
respiratory disorders, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-ulcer.<br>
Such extracts either in presence or absence of piperine have been found to be highly<br>
selective in their bioavailability/ bioefficacy enhancing action.<br>

Chemistry of Zingiber officinale<br>
On steam distillation, dried, cracked and comminuted ginger yields 1-3%<br>
(average 2%) of pale yellow, viscid oil. The oil possesses the aromatic odor but not<br>
the pungent flavor (bite) of the spice. Of course, the odor of the oil is quite lasting.<br>
The physico- chemical characteristics of the oil vary depending upon the variety,<br>
period of storage and method of extraction etc (E. Guenther, The Essential Oils vol v<br>
V.D. Van Nostrand Co., Inc, NY (1952), 116). It is more economical and convenient<br>
to recover oil or oleoresin from dried ginger than from fresh ones. However, fresh<br>
scrapings of ginger are quite rich in oil and should be immediately used for steam<br>
distillation, otherwise 60-80% of volatile oil is lost. Ginger oleoresin is obtained by<br>
extraction of powdered dried ginger with suitable solvents like alcohol, acetone or any<br>
other efficient solvent. Unlike volatile oil, it contains both the volatile oil and nonvolatile<br>
pungent principles for which ginger is so highly valued. Concentration of the<br>
solvent extracts under vacuum and on complete removal of even trace of solvent used<br>
yields the oleoresin of ginger. The quantitative composition of the oleoresin depends<br>
upon the solvent used. Ginger oleoresin (Gingerin) generally contains following types<br>
of compounds: Gingerols, Zingerones, Shogaols, volatile oil, resins, phenols etc.<br>
Ginger oleoresin is manufactured in India and abroad and is in great demand by the<br>
various food industries.<br>
Chemical composition of ginger oil and oleoresin<br>
The oil contains sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (50% or more), sesquiterpene<br>
alcohols, monoterpenoids and associated compounds, esters of acetic acid and<br>
caprylic acid and a trace of chavicol. The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons present are<br>
Zingiberene (a and p, -35.6%), ar-curcumene (17.7%), farnesene (9.8%) and<br>
relatively smaller amounts of p-bisabolene, y-selinene, p-elemene and Psesquiphellandrene.<br>
Oxygenated sesquiterpene constituents include zingiberol and<br>
two other isomeric alcohols. Monoterpene hydrocarbons present in the oil include<br>
camphene, a and P -pinene, cumene, myrcene, limonene, p-cymene and Pphellandrene.<br>
The oxygenated monoterpenes and associated compounds present are 2-<br>
heptanol, 2-nonanal, n-nonanal, n-decanal, methyl heptenone and 1,8-cineole. (M.C.<br>
Nigam, I.C.Nigam, L. Lev! &amp; K.L.Handa Can J. Chem 42 (1964), 2610)<br>
Studies on the oils derived from ginger from Jamaica, Nigeria, Sierraleone,<br>
China, India and Australia have shown that the composition of the oils have similar<br>
patterns, although quantitative differences do exist. The content of zingiberenes lies in<br>
the range of 20-30%; the ranges of values for a few other constituents are: Pbisabolene,<br>
5-12%; ar-curcumene, 6-19% and p-sesquiphellandrene, 7-12%. The<br>
citral (geranial and neral) content is highly variable; the Australian oils are rich in<br>
citral (8-27% av. 19.8%; a sample prepared from fresh rhizomes by extraction at r.t.<br>
contained 8.8% geranial and 1.5% neral).<br>
The pungent principles of ginger are non-volatile. These can be extracted from<br>
coarsely ground-dried spice by using some suitable solvent. They mainly consist of<br>
oxymethyl phenols, the major components being gingerol, shogaol, zingerone and<br>
paradol. (D.W.Connell and M.D. Sutherland, Aust. J. Chem. Soc. 22 (1969), 1033;<br>
E.K.Nelson, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 39 (1917), 1466)<br>
The present invention is directed to preparation of active extracts/bioactive<br>
fraction/ isolate from the plant Zinziber officinale which include their chemical<br>
characterization, fingerprint profiling and methods of using such products to<br>
enhance bioavailability and/ or bioefficacy of drugs, natural products and essential<br>
nutraceuticals. The present invention is directed to preparation of composite<br>
bioenhancers comprising polar and non-polar extracts of parts of Zingiber officinale<br>
and/ or piperine (E\: Piper nigrum and Piper longum) which increased significantly<br>
(25- 435 %), the bioavailability of a number of classes of drugs, for example, but not<br>
limited to antibiotics, antifungals, anti-virals, anticancer, cardiovascular, CNS, antiinflammatory/<br>
anti-arthritic, anti-TB/ antileprosy, anti-histaminic/respiratory disorders,<br>
corticosteroids, immunosppressants, anti-ulcer. Such extracts/bioactive fractions of<br>
Zinziber officinale either in presence or absence of piperine (Ex: Piper nigrum and<br>
Piper longum) have been found to be highly selective in their bioavailability/<br>
bioefficacy enhancing action.<br>
There is a great interest and medical need for the improvement of<br>
bioavailability of a large number of drugs which are (a) poorly bioavailable, (b) given<br>
for long periods, and are (c) toxic and expensive. Maximizing oral bioavailability is<br>
therapeutically important because the extent of bioavailability directly influences<br>
plasma concentrations and consequently therapeutic efficacy and dose related toxic<br>
effects resulting after oral drug administration. Poorly bioavailable drugs remain subtherapeutic<br>
because a major portion of a dose never reaches the plasma or exerts its<br>
pharmacological effect unless and until very large doses are given which may lead to<br>
serious side effects. Any significant improvement in bioavailability will result in<br>
lowering the dose or the dose frequency of that particular drug. Besides, inter-subject<br>
variability is inversely correlated with the extent of bioavailability. Therefore, low<br>
oral bioavailability leads to high variability and poor control of plasma concentration<br>
and pharmacodynamic effects. Inter-subject variability is particularly of concern for a<br>
drug with a narrow safety margin.<br>
Incomplete oral bioavailability has various causes. These include poor<br>
dissolution or low aqueous solubility, poor intestinal membrane permeation,<br>
degradation of the drug in gastric or intestinal fluids and pre-systemic intestinal or<br>
hepatic metabolism. The normal practice to offset some of these problems has been<br>
to increase the dosage as stated earlier which has the concern toxicity of patients' noncompliance.<br>
Many therapeutic treatments are also accompanied by loss of essential<br>
nutraceuticals in the course of therapy. The present invention improves nutritional status<br>
by increasing bioavailability/ bioefficacy of various nutraceuticals also, which include<br>
metals and vitamins. The bioenhancers of the invention also have the potential to enhance<br>
the bioefficacy of a drug without influencing its plasma concentrations for various<br>
reasons, some of which, but not limited to, are described later in this invention under<br>

Bioavailability / bioefficacy enhancing activity<br>
The aqueous, aqueous - alcoholic, ketonic, ethereal, halogenated solvents<br>
extracts of the plant parts were evaluated with different therapeutic categories of<br>
drugs and nutrients (vital amino acids, metals, antioxidants, vitamins) and herbal<br>
drugs. The bioavailability / bioefficacy enhancing (BE) activity of the extracts was<br>
found to be consistent from 10 mg to 150 mg irrespective of the amount of the drug(s)<br>
present in the formulation. Sub-bioactive fractions of the active extracts were also<br>
evaluated, with the same categories of drugs. The BE activity of the bioactive<br>
fraction (s) increased corresponding to their proportions in the parent extract. The<br>
doses of the fraction (s) responsible for the BE activity ranged from 0.5 to 45 mg.<br>
The parent extract as well as the active fraction (s) were found to be active<br>
individually as well as in combination with each other with different categories of<br>
drugs. The bioenhancer activity of the fraction (s) was found to be consistent from<br>
2.0 mg to 30.0 mg irrespective of the amount of the drug (s) present in the<br>
formulation. The BE activity of the fraction (s) was more enhanced as compared to<br>
that of the parent extracts.<br>
The extracts or its bioactive fractions were found to be 25- 80 % more active<br>
when used individually in combination with piperine (1- piperoyl piperidine). Besides<br>
both the parent extracts as wells as their bioactive fractions in different combinations<br>
showed pronounced activity ranging from 20-70 % in presence of piperine. The<br>
amount of piperine in these formulations ranging from 03- 15 mg.<br>
The extracts or its fractions either in presence or absence of piperine have<br>
been found to be highly selective in their bioavailability enhancing activity. This is<br>
apparent from the degree of bioavailibility enhancement caused by these extracts/<br>
bioactive fractions. It varies from nil to nearly significant (15 %) to highly<br>
significant ( 120 %). The reasons for this rather selective pattern as applicable to<br>
t<br>
formulations with or without piperine may be as follows:<br>
The extract or its bioactive fraction (s) have been found to be highly selective<br>
in their bioavailability enhancing activity. This is more than apparent from the<br>
degree of bioavailability enhancement caused by these extract/ fraction (s). It varies<br>
from almost nearly significant (20%) to highly significant (200%). The reasons for<br>
this non-uniform or rather selective pattern as applicable to formulations with or<br>
without piperine may be as follows:<br>
1. The extracts/fractions may be enhancing the absorption / transport of certain<br>
drugs/nutrients from the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
2. They may be inhibiting partially the specific drug metabolising enzymes,<br>
responsible for selective biotransformation of molecules, thus prolonging the<br>
elimination or biological half- life of the drug.<br>
3. An increased penetration of therapeutic drugs into their cellular/molecular targets<br>
could also be one of the reasons.<br>
4. The formulations may also affect the protein/tissue binding of active drugs, which<br>
may be responsible for enhanced bioenhancing effect.<br>
5. Direct potentiation of mechanism of action of a drug may be an important factor<br>
contributing to enhanced bioavailability.<br>
6. An enhanced immune response of the host by the incorporation of bioenhancer<br>
may cause increase in therapeutic response of the active drugs.<br>
7. A combination of either two or more than two factors as enumerated above [Serial<br>
No. 1-6] may be prevalent in the overall bioenhancing effect.<br>
8. The reasons for this selective pattern may be attributable to one or more than one<br>
of the following factors: (a) promoting the absorption of drugs from GIT (b)<br>
inhibiting / reducing the rate of biotransformation of drugs in the liver or<br>
intestines (c) modifying the immune system in a way that the overall requirement<br>
of the drug is reduced substantially (d) increasing the penetration or the entry into<br>
the pathogens even where they become persistors within the macrophages such as<br>
for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and such others. This eventually ensures the<br>
enhanced killing of these organisms well secured within the places otherwise<br>
inaccessible to the active drug, (e) Inhibiting the capability of pathogens or<br>
abnormal tissue to reject the drug e.g., efflux mechanisms frequently encountered<br>
with anti-malarial, anti-cancer and anti-microbial drugs (f) modifying the<br>
signaling process between host and pathogens ensuring increased accessibility of<br>
the drugsto the pathogens (g) Enhancing the binding of the drug with the target<br>
sites such as receptors, proteins, DNA, RNA and the like in the pathogen, thus<br>
potentiating and prolonging its effect leading to enhanced antibiotic activity<br>
against pathogens (h) Besides above plausible modes of action the bioenhancer<br>
agents may also be useful for promoting the transport of nutrients and the drugs<br>
across the blood- brain barrier which could be of immense help in the control of<br>
diseases like cerebral infections, epilepsy and other CNS problems.<br>
Primarily, but not exclusively, the invention enhances the carrier-mediated<br>
entry of the drug and also thepassive diffusion and the active transport pathways in<br>
the tissue which are responsible for transporting physiological substances such as<br>
nutraceutical to their target sites. As applicable to any mechanism of action the<br>
products of this invention contribute in a synergistic and/ or additive manner so that<br>
most drugs and nutraceuticals in presence of the products described in the present art<br>
are more bioavailable or bioefflcaceous as a result of one or more of the mechanisms.<br>
The bioavailability and the bioefficacy of drugs and nutraceuticals is also relevant to<br>
animal health besides being important for humans. The invention therefore is also<br>
intended to be used in veterinary preparations.<br>
The invention further relates to the isolation of an extract and/or its fraction<br>
from the plant Zingiber officinale, its standardization with its intended use as drug<br>
bioavailability enhancer for the drugs belonging to therapeutic categories such as<br>
antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-viral, antitubercular, antileprosy, antiinflammatory,<br>
antiarthritic, cardiovascular, antihistaminics, respiratory distree relieving drugs,<br>
immunosuppressants, nutraceuticals in compositions to be administered<br>
orally/parenterally, topically, inhalations (including nebulizers), rectally, vaginally in<br>
human beings and/or veterinary conditions.<br>
In addition, the invention relates to the preparation of a formulation containing<br>
extract and/or its fraction/ isolate from the plant Zingiber officinale, and piperine, its<br>
standardization with its intended use as drug bioavailability enhancer for the drugs<br>
belonging to therapeutic categories such as antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-viral,<br>
antitubercular, antileprosy, antiinflammatory, antiarthritic, cardiovascular,<br>
antihistaminics, respiratory distress relieving drugs, immunosuppressants,<br>
nutraceuticals in compositions to be administered orally/ parenterally, topically,<br>
inhalations (including nebulizers), rectally, vaginally in human beings and /or<br>
veterinary conditions<br>
The bioavailability enhancer principle may be any extract, its bioactive<br>
fraction and/or a pure isolate from the plant.<br>
The bioavailability enhancer principle may be any extract, its bioactive<br>
fraction and/or a pure isolate of the plant in combination with piperine<br>
A process for the preparation of extract (s)/ bioactive fractions(s)/ pure isolate<br>
(s) which may involve the use of water, alcohol, combinations of water and alcohol,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones, ethers as solvents.<br>

piperine making use of physical techniques like dialysis/ molecular<br>
sieves/membranes, variety of chromatographic techniques and/or liquid-liquid or solid<br>
phase extractions, followed by their complete finger print profiles (HPLC/ HPTLC/<br>
LC-MS-MS)<br>
The formulation of a drug selected from any of the therapeutic categories of<br>
the drugs, nutraceuticals, herbal drugs/formulations in combination with the<br>
bioenhancer may be intended for routes of administration viz., oral, parenteral, nasal,<br>
inhalation including nebulisers, rectal, vaginal, transdermal and others.<br>
The bioenhancing effect of the extracts/ bioactive fractions/pure isolates of<br>
Zingiber officinale either alone or in combination with piperine is selective and does<br>
not enhance the bioavailability/ bioefficacy of each and every drug, nutraceutical,<br>
herbal drug/ formulation.<br>
The amount of the extracts in the bioavailablity/bioefficacy enhanced<br>
formulation (s) may range from 05 to 75 mg irrespective of the amount of drugs in the<br>
formulation (s).<br>
The amount of the fraction/ pure isolate in the bioavailability/ bioefficacy<br>
enhanced formulation (s) may range from 1.0 to 30 .0 mg irrespective of the amount<br>
of drug (s) incorporated in the formulation (s).<br>
That the extracts/ fractions/ pure isolates or piperine express no biological or<br>
toxicological effect of their own at the doses at which they are intended<br>
The following examples are intended to demonstrate some of the preferred<br>
embodiments and in no way should be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Any person skilled in the art can design more formulations, which may be considered<br>
as part of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of colourless, non-pungent piperine by a novel process. Commercially<br>
available Piper nigrum or Piper longum or their oleoresins have been used as the<br>
source material. 20 kg long pepper oleoresin is extracted with chlorinated solvents<br>
like CHC13, CH2C12, C2H4C12 (25 litre) for six hours or 20 kg black pepper powder is<br>
soxhletted with toluene for 8 hours. The extracts are concentrated to dryness under<br>
reduced pressure and dissolved in ethanol at 78° C. The ethanolic solution is adsorbed<br>
over neutral Al^Cb and packed in a glass column. Elution is carried out with CHCb:<br>
EtOH (9:1) and the eluate is concentrated to dryness and dissolved in minimum<br>
quantity of ethanol. The solution is treated with activated charcoal and filtered<br>
through a celite bed. The filtrate is concentrated to saturation point, cooled when<br>
colorless crystalline precipitate is obtained. The precipitate is separated by suction<br>
filtration and dried.<br>
The specifications of the preferred materials are as under:<br>
Colour: Colourless monoclinic prismatic crystals; Melting point: 131° C;<br>
Assay: Minimum (99.1 % (by LC/MS)<br>
Example 2<br>
The extract and the active fractions are prepared from the plant material Z officint<br>
as per the flow chart accompanying the specification.<br>
Preparation and fully finger printed (HPLC) profile of the products is apper<br>
separately.<br>
Example 3<br>
Doses, models/design of experiment and estimation methodology in a tyf<br>
experiment<br>
Note<br>
1. Bioenhancers ( BE ) from Zingiber officinalis means either<br>
aqueous, or 50% alcoholic extract or fraction No<br>
2. In case of Zingiber officinale, not withstanding the difference in i<br>
of extract or its fraction, the enhancement caused in the bioavailah<br>
of the drug with which they are combined remains the same, bee<br>
the dose of the fraction used is proportionate to its concentration it<br>
extract.<br>
3. The doses remained unchanged even when the bioenhancers (1<br>
were used in combination with each other.<br>
Example 4: Doses:<br>
(i) Bioenhancer (BE) from Zingiber officinale<br>
Extract: 30 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
Fraction No 1: 15 mg/ kg body weight (Rats)<br>
(ii) Piperine: 8 mg/kg body weight (Rats)<br>
(iii) Bioenhancer from Zingiber officinale: 35 mg/ kg body weight (Rat<br>
As an example of an experiment in Rat (fasted):<br>
Drug: Rifampicin ,40 mg/kg<br>
BE (Zingiber officinale &amp; others): Doses as in Example No. 4<br>
Experimental procedure: Drug alone/ or in combination with BE was administer<br>
rats as per the following design:<br>
Group 1: Control<br>
Group 2: Rifampictn alone<br>
Group 3: BE alone<br>
Group 4: Rifampicin + BE (Zingiber officinale)<br>
Blood from control/ treated animals at predetermined intervals (0- 24 hrs) (Total 14<br>
timings) Rifampicin was extracted from the blood (plasma) using dichloromethane.<br>
The concentration of rifampicin in the samples was determined using HPLC (Model:<br>
Shimadzu 1080 BP) ; PDA detector; Mobile phase : phosphate buffer: acetonitile<br>
(40:60); Flow rate 1.0 ml/min. Column RP 18.<br>
Control and BE only groups were employed to study the interference of plasma<br>
component and the bioenhancer used.<br>
Example 5<br>
The above methodology was adapted for evaluating the bio-enhancing activity of<br>
other drugs, micro nutrients, nutracuticals, nutrients and other herbal products and the<br>
enhancing effects are tabulated under each heading.<br>
