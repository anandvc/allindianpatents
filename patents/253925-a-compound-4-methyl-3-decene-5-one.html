				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to new chemical entities and the incorporation and use of the new chemical entities as fragrance materials.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There is an ongoing need in the fragrance industry to provide new chemicals to give perfumers and other persons ability to create new fragrances for perfumes, colognes and personal care products. Those with skill in the art appreciate how differences in the chemical structure of the molecule can result in significant differences in the odor, notes and characteristics of a molecule. These variations and the ongoing need to discover and use the new chemicals in the development of new fragrances allows perfumers to apply the new compounds in creating new fragrances.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides novel chemicals, and the use of the chemicals to enhance the fragrances of perfumes, toilet waters, colognes, personal products and the like. In addition, the present invention is directed to the use of the novel chemicals to enhance fragrance in perfumes, toilet waters, colognes, personal products and the like.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is directed to the novel compounds, represented by the general structures of Formula I and Formula II set forth below:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is a hydrocarbon moiety consisting of 2 to 10 carbon atoms, including cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, benzyl, or phenylethyl. Rl is either methyl or ethyl.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method for enhancing a perfume by incorporating an olfactory acceptable amount of the compounds provided above.<br>
These and other embodiments of the present invention will be apparent by reading the following specification.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In Formula I and Formula II above, R represents a hydrocarbon, a cyclic, or an aromatic group consisting of 2 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably, R is a pentyl group. Hydrocarbon, cyclic or aromatic R groups include, but are not limited to the straight alkyl, cyclic, and aromatic chains. Suitable straight hydrocarbon moieties include ethyl, propyl, butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. Suitable branched hydrocarbon moieties include isopropyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, 2-ethyl-propyl, and the like. Suitable hydrocarbon moieties containing double and triple bonds include ethene, propene, 1-butene, 2-butene, penta-l-3-deine, hepta-l,3,5-triene, butyne, hex-1-yne and the like. Suitable aromatic moieties include phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl and the like. In Formula II above, Rl represents a methyl or an ethyl group. Those with skill in the art will recognize that the compound of Formula I of the present invention has a chiral center, thereby providing several isomers of the claimed compound. As used herein the compounds described herein include the isomeric mixtures of the compounds as well as those isomers that may be separated using techniques known to those with skill in the art. Suitable separation techniques include chromatography, particularly gel chromatography.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared from the following compound of Formula III:<br>
The preparation and use of the compound of Formula III is discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,585,662, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the Formula III, R has the same definition as set forth above.<br>
The compound of Formula I may be prepared from the compound of Formula III by following the Oppenauer oxidation reaction procedure (see Example A). The amount of ketone recovered after the reaction is completed is from about 70% to about 95% by weight of the product mixture. We have discovered that the compounds of Formula I have green, pleasant notes that are well suited for use as a fragrance ingredeint.<br>
The compound of Formula II may be prepared by nucleophilic addition of an appropriately substituted alkyl, cyclic or aromatic Grignard reagent or alkyl lithilum to the compound of Formula I (see Example C). We have discovered that the compounds of Formula II<br>
have a banana fruity note with violet, soft green tones that are well suited for use as a fragrance ingredient.<br>
The use of the compound of the present invention is widely applicable in current perfumery products, including the preparation of perfumes and colognes, the perfuming of personal care products such as soaps, shower gels, and hair care products as well as air fresheners and cosmetic preparations. The present invention can also be used to perfume cleaning agents, such as, but not limited to detergents, dishwashing materials, scrubbing compositions, window cleaners and the like.<br>
In these preparations, the compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other perfuming compositions, solvents, adjuvants and the like. The nature and variety of the other ingredients that can also be employed are known to those with skill in the art.<br>
Many types of fragrances can be employed in the present invention, the only limitation being the compatibility with the other components being employed. Suitable fragrances include but are not limited to fruits such as almond, apple, cherry, grape, pear, pineapple, orange, strawberry, raspberry; musk, flower scents such as lavender-like, rose-like, iris-like, carnation-like. Other pleasant scents include herbal and woodland scents derived from pine, spruce and other forest smells. Fragrances may also be derived from various oils, such as essential oils, or from plant materials such as peppermint, spearmint and the like.<br>
A list of suitable fragrances is provided in US Pat. No. 4,534,891, the contents of which are incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. Another source of suitable fragrances is found in Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps, Second Edition, edited by W. A. Poucher, 1959. Among the fragrances provided in this treatise are acacia, cassie, chypre, cyclamen, fern, gardenia, hawthorn, heliotrope, honeysuckle, hyacinth, jasmine, lilac, lily, magnolia, mimosa, narcissus, freshly-cut hay, orange blossom, orchid, reseda, sweet pea, trefle, tuberose, vanilla, violet, wallflower, and the like.<br>
Olfactory effective amount is understood to mean the amount of compound in perfume compositions the individual component will contribute to its particular olfactory characteristics, but the olfactory effect of the perfume composition will be the sum of the effects of each of the perfumes or fragrance ingredients. Thus the compounds of the invention can be used to alter the aroma characteristics of the perfume composition, or by modifying the olfactory reaction contributed by another ingredient in the composition. The amount will vary depending on many factors including other ingredients, their relative amounts and the effect that is desired.<br>
The level of compound of the invention employed in the perfumed article varies from about 0.005 to about 10 weight percent, preferably from about 0.5 to about 8 and most preferably from about 1 to about 7 weight percent. In addition to the compounds other agents can be used<br>
in conjunction with the fragrance. Well known materials such as surfactants, emulsifiers, polymers to encapsulate the fragrance can also be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Another method of reporting the level of the compounds of the invention in the perfumed composition, i.e., the compounds as a weight percentage of the materials added to impart the desired fragrance. The compounds of the invention can range widely from 0.005 to about 70 weight percent of the perfumed composition, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 and most preferably from about 0.2 to about 25 weight percent. Those with skill in the art will be able to employ the desired level of the compounds of the invention to provide the desired fragrance and intensity.<br>
The following are provided as specific embodiments of the present invention. Other modifications of this invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such modifications are understood to be within the scope of this invention. As used herein all percentages are weight percent unless otherwise noted, ppm is understood to stand for parts per million and g is understood to be grams. IFF as used in the examples is understood to mean International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc.<br>
