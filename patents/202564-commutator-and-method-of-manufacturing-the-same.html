				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a commutator and a method of manufacturing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a commutator having a brush contact surface that is a plane perpendicular relative to the rotary shaft thereof and adapted to be effectively used for a starter motor of an engine.<br>
2.	Related Art Statement<br>
Starter motors of engines having a commutator with the brush contact surface directed perpendicularly relative to the rotary shaft are known to reduce the radial dimension.<br>
In the commutator of this known type, a plurality of sector-like segments are arranged annularly and insulated from each other. The segments are integrally held by a molded base that is made of resin.<br><br>
A riser is formed along the outer peripheral edge of each segment. Then, the riser is electrically connected to a coiled wire.<br>
Such a commutator is generally manufactured in a manner as described below. Firstly, the base is molded on a disk-shaped blank having a half diameter equal to the radial dimension of each segment plus that of its riser. Then, the blank is cut along radial lines to produce a plurality of segments having respective risers arranged along the outer periphery by means of a slit cutter.<br>
However, with the above described known method of manufacturing a commutator, both the risers and the segments have to be cut.  Then,<br>
1A<br><br>
the cutting distance of each stroke of the slit cutter is rather long and hence the method requires a long total cutting time.<br>
On the other hand, the risers are not molded from resin along the opposite axial edges so that the corresponding coiled wire may be axially inserted and fused. As any two adjacently located segments are cut along the slit separating them, their risers are normally more affected by the fusing operation because they are not reinforced by the resin of the base and hence mechanically not very strong This problem is avoided only by giving rise to another problem of preparing thick segments and thick risers to make them mechanically sufficiently strong.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a commutator that can  reduce the cutting-distance of each stroke of the slit cutter and nevertheless shows an enhanced mechanical strength, as well as a method of manufacturing such a commutator.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a commutator comprising a plurality of segments arranged annularly and insulated from each other, said segments being integrally held on a base formed by molding a synthetic resin material, and risers arranged along the outer peripheral edges of the respective segments and connected to respective coiled wires, characterized in that <br>
the brush contact surface of said group of segments projects axially from the pane including said risers ;<br>
2<br><br>
the outer peripheral edge of each of the risers is provided with a radial groove into which said coiled wire is inserted ; and<br>
a reinforcement is formed between any two adjacently located ones of said risers by filling the gap therebetween with the resin material of the base.<br>
Additionally, an anchor may be formed on the inner surface of the step-shaped section between the plane of each segment including its riser and the brush contact surface and buried in the base.<br>
The present invention, also provides a method of manufacturing a commutator, characterized by comprising steps of<br>
preparing a blank made of an electrical conductive material for concentrically forming a segment section of a plurality of segments arranged in a predetermined manner and a riser section of a plurality of risers also arranged in a predetermined manner with a step-shaped section arranged along the boundary of said segment section and said riser section, wherein a groove for receiving a coiled wire is formed in each of the risers from the outer periphery thereof, and<br>
forming a plurality of slits in said segment section by cutting the blank, the number of the slits being same as that of the segments.<br>
In this case, a preliminary slit may be formed on the linear extension of each of the slits of the risers A radial groove may be formed from the outer periphery between any two adjacently located risers for allowing the corresponding coiled wire to be inserted therein<br>
3<br><br>
With the above manufacturing method, the blank is cut along slits formed in the segment area that is the upper portion of the step-shaped section formed between the segments and the risers to separate the segments apart from each other so that the cutting distance of each stroke of the slit cutter can be reduced to consequently reduce the total cutting time and the cost of manufacturing a commutator<br>
Additionally, the inner space of the step-shaped section of segment is filled with the resin of the base to reinforce the segment and enhance the mechanical strength of the segment.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIGS. 1A and 1B show a principal portion of the rotor of a starter motor to which an embodiment of commutator according to the invention is applied, FIG. 1A being a schematic plan view, FIG. 1B being a schematic cross sectional front view taken along line b-b in FIG. 1A. FIGS 2A through FIG 7 illustrate a method of manufacturing a commutator according to the invention<br>
The commutator of this embodiment is used for the rotor of the starter motor of an engine. The commutator has a flat profile formed on a plane and its brush contact surface is perpendicular relative to the rotary shaft thereof.<br>
5<br><br>
The commutator 1 of this embodiment comprises a base (base section) 41 showing a profile of a combination of two cylindrical columns having different diameters and made of resin that is an electric insulator, a plurality of sector-like segments 10 formed and arranged radially an the base 41 and a riser section 21 having risers 20 formed integrally with the respective segments 10 along the outer peripheral edges of the latter. The base has a shaft hole 42 bored through the center thereof, in which a rotary shaft 50 is placed by press-fitting<br>
As described in greater detail hereinafter, the segments 10 are produced by cutting a blank 2 sectorally along radial slits 15. The blank 2 is a disk-shaped copper plate produced by means of a press The risers 20 are integrally formed with the respective segments 10 along the outer peripheral edges of the latter. A step-shaped or stepped section 30 is defined by the plane surface of the risers 20 and that of the segments 10 As a result, the plane surface of the risers 20 is recessed along the rotary shaft from the brush contact surface 12 formed by the plane surface of the segments 10. The segments 10 are arranged an the base 41 to show an annular contour Then, the segments 10 are rigidly secured relative to each other to became integral with the base 41.<br>
6<br><br>
The risers 20 arranged along the outer peripheral edge of the respective segments 10 are radially and outwardly projecting from the outer periphery of the base 41. A groove 24 is cut into each of the risers 20 from the outer peripheral edge thereof. The ends 52 of a coiled wire are inserted into the groove 24, and they are electrically<br>
connected to the riser 20.  The ends 52 of the coiled wire,<br>
.-        -         <br>
electrically connected to the groove 24 of the riser 20 projected from the base 41, is extended to the axis of the rotary shaft and wound around armature 51.<br>
Now, a method of manufacturing a commutator according to the invention and having a configuration as  described above will be described below.  Thus, the commutator will be described in greater detail in the following description.<br>
Firstly, in a blank preparing step, a blank as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B is prepared. FIGS. 2A and 2B show a blank that can be used for manufacturing a commutator as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, FIG. 2A being a schematic plan view, FIG. 2B being a schematic cross sectional front view taken along line b-b in FIG. 2A.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the blank 2 is flat and disk-shaped. The blank 2 is arranged coaxially on a flat and square outer frame<br>
3	.  Then, the blank 2 is suspended by means of three suspension bridges<br>
4	arranged angularly at regular intervals along the outer periphery<br>
thereof.  The blank 2, the outer frame 3 and the suspension bridges<br>
4 are made of copper and produced integrally by means of a press machine .<br>
The bridges 4 are projected from the periphery of a circular hole 5<br>
of the outer frame 3 and three aligning semicircular holes 6 are<br>
arranged angularly at regular intervals along the inner periphery of<br>
7<br><br>
the hole 5. Arcuate slots 7 are cut through the outer frame 3 at  positions outside the respective bridges 4.  Three aligning<br>
semicircular holes 8 are arranged along the outer peripheries of the respective slots 7. Four circular aligning holes 9 are bored through the outer frame 3 respectively at the four corners thereof. Note that the bridges 4, the hole 5 and the slots 7 take the role of preventing the blank 2 from being deformed by stress in the course of press machining process.<br>
The blank 2 comprises a segment section 11 and a riser section 21. The segment section 11 is used to form a plurality of segments 10 (a total of 21 in this embodiment) . The riser section 21 includes the same number of risers 20, each of which is integrally connected to the outer peripheral edge of the corresponding one of the segments 10. The segment section 11 and the riser section 21 are arranged annually and concentrically. More specifically, the riser section 21 is concentrically arranged outside the segment section 11.<br>
A stepped section 30 is formed at the boundary of the segment section 11 and the riser section 21.  The stepped section 30 is ring-shaped and concentric relative to the segment section 11 and the riser section 21.  It is formed by means of a press machine (reducing mill) .  The end face (hereinafter referred to as riser upper surface) of the riser section 21 at the brush contact surface side (to be referred to as upper side) of the commutator is axially recessed from the brush contact surface 12 defined by the segments 10 of the segment section 11 at the stepped section 30.  The recessed distance from the brush contact surface 12 to the riser upper surface 22, or the height H of the brush contact surface 12 from the riser upper surface 22,<br>
8<br><br>
is made greater than the thickness t of the blank 2 by a predetermined value of S.  In other words, the stepped section 30 is designed to<br>
 satisfy a relationship of H=t+S .  The value S corresponds to the escape<br><br>
 margin of the slit cutter required to cut only the segments 10 without<br>
cutting the riser upper surface 22 in the slit forming step as will<br><br>
  be described hereinafter.<br>
   A plurality of inner anchors 13 are formed along the inner periphery of the segment section 11, the number of which is same as that of the segments 10.  The anchor 13 of each of the segments 10 is bent substantially rectangularly from the inner peripheral edge of the segment 10 to move away from the brush contact surface 12. The anchor 13 is held to the base 41 and serves as claw for placing the corresponding segment 10 in position.  Therefore, the anchor 13 is desirably mechanically strong. Additionally, the anchor 13 preferably forms an acute angle with the brush contact surface 12.<br>
An outer anchor 33 is formed for each of the segments 10 along the inner peripheral surface of the stepped section 30. The anchor 33 projects radially inwardly from a position corresponding to the outer peripheral edge of the corresponding segment 10. The anchor 33 is formed by grinding a ground recession 32 at the inner peripheral surface of the stepped section 30. Thus, the anchor 33 is held by the base 41 to prevent the corresponding segment 10 from axially coming off.<br>
The riser section 21 is provided with radially oblong preliminary slits 23 that are formed along imaginary lines 14 for slits for producing segments 10. Each of the slits 23 starts at a point located slightly inwardly from the outer periphery of the riser section 21<br>
9<br><br>
and extends to a point located slightly inwardly from the inner periphery of the riser section 21. Thus, the slit is formed by partly cutting the stepped section 30. Each of the risers 20 is provided with a groove 24 having a contour of a half of an ellipse and extending from the outer peripheral edge thereof. The groove 24 is located at the middle of the span separating two adjacent preliminary slits 23 and produced by means of punching press. The groove 24 has a width slightly greater than the diameter of the coiled wire to be inserted into it. The groove 24 has a length well for receiving two coiled wires 52, 52.<br>
After press machining the blank 2 in a manner as described above, a base 41 made of synthetic resin is fitted to it by molding as shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. More specifically, the base 41 is formed in a base molding step using an insulating synthetic resin material. FIGS . 3A and 3B show the state after the base molding process, FIG. 3A being a schematic plan view, FIG. 3B being a schematic cross sectional front view taking along line b-b in FIG. 3A.<br>
In the case of the molded product 40 of FIGS. 3A and 3B, a base 41 having the form of a combination of two cylindrical columns with different diameters are arranged on the lower surface of the blank 2 opposite to the brush contact surface 12 thereof. The base 41 is made of resin that is an electric insulator and press molding produces it. An axial hole 42 is bored through the base 41 along the center line thereof so that the rotary shaft 50 can be placed therein by press-fitting. The upper surface of the small diameter section 43 of the base 41 is flush with the brush contact surface 12 of the segment section 11.  The lower surface of the small diameter section 43 of<br>
10<br><br>
the base 41 projects downward from the lower surface of the large diameter section 44 of the base 41. The outer periphery of the large diameter section 44 is formed within the outer periphery of the blank 2. The outer periphery of the riser section 21 protrudes from the outer periphery of the base 41.<br>
The slits 23 of the blank 2 are filled with the resin of the base 41. Thus, a reinforcement section 46 is formed in each of the slits 23 by the resin filled therein. Note that, while the slits 23 are filled with the resin of the base 41, the grooves 24 formed along the outer periphery of the blank 2 are not filled with resin.<br>
The anchor 13 of each of the segments 10 is rigidly held to the boundary area of the small diameter section 43 and the large diameter section 44 of the base 41. The anchor 13 is used to align the inner peripheral edge of the corresponding segment 10 relative to the base 41 and hold the segment 10 in position. The anchor 33 of each of the segments 10 is rigidly held to the outer periphery of the large diameter section 44 of the base 41. The anchor 33 is used to align the outer peripheral edge of the corresponding segment 10 relative to the base 41 and hold the segment 10 in position. Thus, the segment 10 is rigidly held to the base 41.<br>
Subsequently, the outer frame 3 of the molded product 40 is moved away as the three suspension bridges 4 are cut. After separating the outer frame 3, the resin of the slits 23 is cut along the outer peripheral edge of the riser section 21 to produce a ring shaped assembly as shown in FIG. 4. As a result, the risers 20 of the riser section 21 are integrally linked to the respective segments 10.  Note that each of the risers 20 is electrically insulated from each other<br>
11<br><br>
by the reinforcements formed in the slits 23.<br>
In the molding step of producing the base, the molded product 40 having a configuration as described above is moved away from the outer frame 3 by cutting the three suspension bridges 4.  Then, in the subsequent slit forming step, slits 15 are radially cut along the respective imaginary radial slit lines 14 by means of a slit cutter 16 as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B.  FIGS. 4A and 4B schematically illustrate the slit forming step of cutting a slit on the blank, FIG. 4A being a schematic plan view, FIG. 4B being a schematic cross sectional front view taken along line b-b in FIG. 4A.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the slit cutter 16 is typically a thin disk-shaped grinder and applied to the slits 23 on a one by one basis. Then, it is driven radially and inwardly from the slit 23 toward the center of the segment section 11 to actually produce a slit 15 on the imaginary slit line 14. Note that the outer peripheral edge of the slit cutter 16 is held away from the upper surface 22 of the riser section 21 so that only the segment section 11 is cut. Note that the segment section 11 is cut into segments 10 by the slits 15, however, the segments 10 are held together in position because the segments 10 are held to the base 41 respectively by means of the anchors 13 and 33.<br>
Then, in the subsequent fusing step, two opposite ends 52 (to be referred to as terminals hereinafter) of a coiled wire of the armature 51 are put into the groove of each of the risers 20. Then, they are fused as shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B to electrically connect the risers 20. FIGS. 6A and 6B schematically illustrate the fusing step, FIG. 6A being a schematic plan view, FIG. 6B being a schematic<br>
12<br><br>
cross sectional front view taken along line b-b in FIG. 6A.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 6A and 6B, the two terminals 52 are inserted into a specified groove 24 in advance.  Then, they are fused together by applying a high frequency voltage by means of the fusing tool 61 of a fusing apparatus 60 while they are pressed against the walls of the groove 24. More specifically, a pair of electrodes 63, 64 connected to the power source 62 of the fusing apparatus 60 are electrically connected to the fusing tool 61 and the riser 20 having the groove 24 and a voltage applied thereto.  The fusing tool 61 is inserted into the groove 24 and pushed radially and inwardly.<br>
As the terminals 52 are pushed into the groove 24 by the fusing tool 61, the lateral walls of the groove 24 are subjected to a force trying to move them apart peripherally and broaden the groove 24. If the slits 23 at the lateral ends of the riser 20 were not filled with resin, the slits 23 on the lateral sides of the riser 20 would be narrowed and eventually reduced to nil by the force at the lateral sides of the groove 24 to short circuit the riser 20 and the adjacently located risers 20, 20.<br>
However, since reinforcements 46 are formed in the respective the slits 23 by filling the latter with resin in this embodiment, the slits 23 on the lateral sides of the riser 20 are not narrowed to become nil by the force trying to broaden the groove 24 so that the riser 20 and the adjacently located risers 20, 20 would not become short circuited. Thus, the riser 20 that is electrically connected to the thermals 52 in the groove 24 by fusing remains electrically isolated from the adjacent risers.<br>
Then, in the subsequent coating step, the entire surface of the<br>
13<br><br>
embodiment is coated with a resin material 47 that is an electric insulator except the brush contact surface 12. FIG. 7 is a partly cut out schematic front view of a commutator during the coating step.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, when the embodiment is coated with a resin material 47, the brush contact surface 12 is masked by a masking jig 70 in order to prevent the resin material 47 from adhering, if partly, to the brush contact surface 12.<br>
If the upper surface 22 of the riser section 21 is flush with the brush contact surface 12 and the fused terminals 52 in the grooves 2 4 of the risers 20 are projecting upward from the brush contact surface 12, the upper ends of the terminals 52 projecting from the brush contact surface 12 can interfere with the masking jig 70 masking the brush contact surface 12. Then, as a result of such interference, a gap may be formed between the masking jig 70 and the brush contact surface 12. Then, the resin material 47 for forming a protection film can flow into the gap and adhere to the brush contact surface 12. This means that isolation material adhere to the brush contact surface 12.<br>
This problem may be avoided by cutting the upper end portions of the terminals 52 projecting from the upper surface 22 before masking the brush contact surface 12 by means of a masking jig 70. However, the terminals 52 have been mollified by the fusing operation so that fins can be produced there when the upper end portions of the terminals are cut. Additionally, if a gap is produced between the masking jig 70 and the brush contact surface 12 by such fins, the resin material 47 can flow into the gap during the coating step and the isolation material adhere to the brush contact surface 12. All in all, a step of removing the fins that might have been produced by the terminals<br>
14<br><br>
52 is required to completely mask the brush contact surface 12 to consequently increase the total number of steps for manufacturing a commutator.<br>
The upper surface 23 of the riser 20 is recessed from the brush contact surface 12 as shown in FIG. 7. Thus, if the terminals 52 of the coiled wires are projecting from the upper surface 22 of the riser 20, they do not interfere with the operation of putting the masking jig 70 tightly in contact with the brush contact surface 12. Then, any adhesion of the isolation material onto the brush contact surface 12 by infiltration of the coating resin material 47 can reliably be prevented from taking place.<br>
Additionally, with the above embodiment,, the terminals 52 of the coiled wire may be projecting from the upper surface of the riser 20 so that a step of cutting the projecting upper end portions of the terminals 52 can be omitted. As a result, the cost of manufacturing a commutator can be reduced and any possible appearance of fins that may otherwise occur as a result of cutting the upper end portions of the terminals 52 that have been mollified by the fusing step can be effectively avoided.<br>
The above described embodiment provides the following advantages.<br>
Firstly, as a result of forming a stepped section between the segment section of the blank and the riser section, segments can be produced with ease by forming slits only in the segment section that is the upper portion of the stepped section. Then, the length of cutting the slits can be reduced to by turn reduce the cutting time required for cutting the slits.  Thus, the cost of manufacturing the<br>

commutator can be reduced.<br>
Secondly, as a result of filling the inner space of the stepped section separating the segment section and the riser section with the resin material of the base, the segments can be reinforced by the resin material.  Thus, a small thickness can be selected for the segments.<br>
Thirdly, as a result of selecting a small thickness for the segments, the centrifugal force of the commutator that appears when the latter is driven to rotate can be reduced.  Then, the outer diameter of the commutator can be increased as a function of the reduction of the centrifugal force. When the commutator is allowed to have a large outer diameter, the risers fitted to the outer peripheral edges of the respective segments shows a large peripheral width so that the grooves of the risers are allowed to have a large width. Accordingly, coiled wires having a large diameter can be used for the commutator to consequently enhance the power output of the motor incorporating the commutator. Additionally, with the brush contact surface of the segment section is made to have a large radial dimension, a large brush can be used with the commutator to improve the durability of the brush.<br>
Additionally, as a result of forming a base by molding a resin material before cutting slits into the blank, an adjacently located segments can be reliably insulated from each other by the slit located between them.<br>
Still additionally, as a result of forming reinforcements by filling the preliminary slits with resin, the risers can be prevented from being deformed during the operation of fusing the terminals of coiled wires to the lateral walls of the grooves of the risers.  Thus,<br>
16<br><br>
any possible short circuiting of adjacently located risers due to the fusing operation can be effectively eliminated.<br>
Still additionally, as a result of recessing the upper surface of the riser section from the brush contact surface, a coating jig can be reliably and tightly brought into contact with the brush contact surface to form a protection film on the latter without interference of the terminals of coiled wires even if the terminals of coiled wires are projecting upwardly from the upper surface of the riser. Thus, any possible infiltration and adhesion of the coating material' that is an electric insulator onto the brush contact surface can be reliably eliminated.<br>
Furthermore, as the terminals of coiled wired are allowed to be projecting from the upper surface of the riser, the upper end portions thereof are not required to be cut. As a result, the cost of manufacturing a commutator can be reduced and any possible appearance of fins that may otherwise occur as a result of cutting the upper end portions of the terminals that have been mollified by the fusing step can be effectively avoided.<br>
Finally, as a result of arranging outer anchors that are projecting inwardly to the stepped section, the outer anchors and hence the segments can be rigidly held to the base.<br>
Detailed description has hereinabove been given of the invention achieved by the present inventor with reference to the embodiment. However, the present invention should not be limited to the embodiment described above, and may be variously modified within the scope not departing from the gist.<br>
For example, not a single blank but a plurality of blanks may<br>
17<br><br>
be arranged continuously on an outer frame.<br>
Additionally, in place of forming outer anchors on the stepped section by cutting, an annular groove may be formed in the inner peripheral surface of the stepped section by cutting or stamping press.<br>
Still additionally, in place of forming inner anchors on the inner peripheral edge of the segment section by cutting, an annular groove may be formed in the inner peripheral surface of the segment section by cutting.<br>
A commutator according to the invention can be used not only for a stator motor but also for a motor of some other type.<br>

provided  with  an  anchor on  the  inner surface  of a  step-shaped  section<br>
separating the plane including the risers and the brush contact surface of the<br>
group of segments and said anchor is rigidly secured to the base<br>
3.	A  method   of  manufacturing  a  commutator as  claimed   in  claim   1,<br>
characterized by comprising steps of:<br>
preparing a blank made of an electrical conductive material for concentrically forming a segment section of a plurality of segments arranged in a<br>
19<br><br>
predetermined manner and a riser section of a plurality of risers also arranged in a predetermined manner with a step-shaped section arranged along the boundary of said segment section and said riser section, wherein a groove for receiving a coiled wire is formed in each of the risers from the outer periphery thereof; and<br>
forming a plurality of slits in said segment section by cutting the blank, the number of the slits being same as that of the segments<br><br>
20<br>
4.	The method of manufacturing  a commutator as claimed  in claim  3,<br>
wherein in said step of preparing the blank, an opening portion is formed on<br>
each of extensions of locations corresponding to said slits in said risers.<br>
5.	A   commutator,   substantially   as   herein   described,   particularly   with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
6.	A  method   of  manufacturing   a   commutator,   substantially   as   herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A commutator comprises a plurality of segments 10 arranged annularly and insulated from each other, the segments 10 being integrally held on a base 41 formed by molding a synthetic resin material, and risers 20 arranged along the outer peripheral edges of the respective segments 10 and connected to the terminals 52 of respective coiled wires, a stepped section 30 being formed at the boundary of the segments 10 and the risers 20, so that the upper surfaces 22 of the risers is axially recessed from the brush contact surface 12 of the segment 10.  With a commutator having the above described configuration, the segments can be separated from each other by forming slits only in the segment section that is the upper portion of the stepped section formed between the segment section and the riser section of a blank.  Thus, the length of each slit that has to be cut is reduced to by turn reduce the time required for the cutting. Bosses are formed in the inner space of the stepped section to reinforce the segments and enhance the mechanical strength of the segments.</td>
