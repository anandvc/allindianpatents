				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to transdermal delivery devices for the<br>
transdermal administration of active substances, such as pharmacologically active<br>
substances, and to the manufacture of such devices.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
The advantages of the transdermal administration of drugs over other<br>
routes are well known. Nevertheless, the skin permeation of the majority of the drugs<br>
is not enough to provide suitable therapeutic levels. The skin, particularly the stratum<br>
comeum, provides a barrier for the permeation of many substances. Several<br>
alternatives have been proposed to solve this problem, most of them based on the use<br>
of a suitable permeation enhancer.<br>
In comparison with the conventional administration routes of potent drugs,<br>
the transdermal administration offers important advantages. The main reasons are its<br>
simplicity and that the administration is not invasive. Moreover, those devices have<br>
more bioavailability than the oral route because the drug avoids the first pass through<br>
the digestive system where it is sometimes metabolised or inactivated in significant<br>
proportions. Besides, its administration can be immediately interrupted if side effects<br>
are detected.<br>
Generally, the transdermal route of administration offers the potential<br>
benefits of simplicity, efficacy and acceptability by the patient. This acceptance is<br>
essential for any treatment with this type of devices and so they must be substantially<br>
comfortable: they should not be bulky, they should be aesthetically pleasant to sight<br>
and touch, should be maintained correctly affixed to the patient"s skin during the<br>
period of use and should be easily detached when required.<br>
Theoretically, transdermal administration devices should provide a steady<br>
plasmatic concentration during an extensive period of time, with an acceptable<br>
variability between patents. The physicochemical and physiological principles that<br>
governs the absorption of drugs through the transdermal route are well known.<br>
In the literature several devices have been described for the transdermal<br>
administration of drugs.<br>
The skin is, generally, an effective barrier for the permeation of drugs and<br>
the diffusion of them is slower than through other membranes of the organism. The<br>
simple occlusion of the skin by means of non-permeable barriers increases the<br>
hydration of the stratum corneum, increasing markedly the permeation of drugs<br>
compared to the skin without occlusion.<br>
Further the vehicle in which the drug is dissolved can also contribute to<br>
determine the extent of absorption. The addition permeation enhancers can increase<br>
several fold the absorption of some drugs. The term "penetration" is used for the<br>
income of the drug to the skin and "permeation" for the process of crossing the skin<br>
and arrival to the circulation, even though there is not an absolute demarcation<br>
between both processes.<br>
The transdermal delivery devices should be formulated so that the<br>
contained drugs have a penetration and a permeation according to the propose of the<br>
product<br>
Nowadays there are different types of transdermal devices. Nevertheless,<br>
these devices could be grouped in two main categories: reservoir-type devices and<br>
matrix-type devices. In the literature other types of device have been described, but<br>
all of them could be considered as extensions of one of these groups or as<br>
combinations of them.<br>
The transdermal devices of reservoir-type contain a reservoir that contains<br>
the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). From that reservoir, the API diffuses<br>
through the controlling membrane to the site of absorption. The controlling<br>
membrane could be microporous or continuous. These devices usually have a<br>
backing layer, a reservoir that contains the drug, a controlling membrane, an adhesive<br>
layer and a release or protective layer. The main advantage of this type of device is<br>
mat the rate of drug delivery is maintained practically constant for long periods of<br>
time. Nevertheless, these devices are usually bulky (voluminous), they have a total<br>
surface that is bigger than the active surface and, besides, they have the disadvantage<br>
that the rupture of the controlling membrane could produce a higher release than<br>
desired.<br>
There are several transdermal devices of this type in the market, which<br>
differ from each other in the reservoir of the drug. The reservoir can be a polymer, a<br>
liquid, a gel or a cream, in which the drug is dissolved or dispersed.<br>
Within the group of patches with reservoir, the transdermal devices with<br>
multireservoirs with controlling membrane as well as the devices with reservoir and<br>
without controlling membrane can be included. The main characteristic of the first<br>
type is that the permeation enhancer agent is stored in a compartment separated from<br>
the drug reservoir and that of the second type is that an adhesive layer not loaded with<br>
drug functions as the control of the permeation.<br>
On the other hand, matrix-type transdermal devices comprise, generally, a<br>
nonpermeable backing liner, a polymeric adhesive matrix in which the active drug or<br>
drugs are dissolved or dispersed and a release liner. They have a total surface area that<br>
is the same as mat of the active surface. Generally, this type of device has had greater<br>
acceptance by patients than the reservoir-type patches.<br>
The current trend in the design of transdermal delivery devices is directed<br>
to matrix-type devices. This is not only because the production costs are lower, but<br>
because it is possible to obtain devices with greater versatility than the reservoir-type<br>
ones.<br>
One disadvantage of the matrix-type devices is that, for some active<br>
substances, it is difficult to maintain a constant dose for extended periods of time.<br>
Generally, in this type of device, the delivery rate diminishes with the time as a<br>
consequence of the decrease of the concentration of the API in the matrix.<br>
The addition of polymeric layers acting as controlling membranes for the<br>
drugs has not been completely successful because they are usually less comfortable to<br>
use by the patient, mainly because their mechanical properties became worse with the<br>
mentioned addition. Another problem to be solved in this type of device is the one<br>
related to physical stability because, generally, to assure a constant delivery, the<br>
active substance needs to be present in a saturation or supersaturated concentration.<br>
Besides, it is important for the comfort of the user that the size of the device should be<br>
as small as possible.<br>
Finally, it is very important that the transdermal device has enough<br>
adhesiveness to be able to remain on the application site assuring suitable drug<br>
delivery during the necessary period of time, while having, at the same time, a<br>
painless removal, which is not easy to obtain.<br>
In literature several documents that disclose devices for transdermal<br>
administration comprising two or more adhesive layers can be found.<br>
As examples, US 4,031,894, US 4,060,084, US 4,262,003, US 4,436,741<br>
and US 4,201,211 (Alza Corporation) disclose devices with reservoir and rate<br>
controlling membrane for the transdermal administration of drugs that deliver an<br>
initial pulse followed by a substantially constant dosage. According to those<br>
documents, the preferred embodiment consists in a therapeutic system in the form of a<br>
bandage with four layers that comprise: a) a protective backing layer, b) a reservoir<br>
layer that comprises the a pharmaceutical active drug (for example scopolamine,<br>
clonidine, etc.) dispersed in a mixture of a mineral oil gel and polyisobutylene, c) a<br>
microporous membrane mat control the rate at which the drug is released and d) an<br>
adhesive layer.<br>
US 5,310,559 (Hercon Laboratories Corporation) disclose devices with<br>
reservoir and controlling rate membrane with a structure similar to the ones already<br>
mentioned that include the use of the copolymers of acrylate-olefin as control rate<br>
membrane of the active substances.<br>
US 5,004,610 (Alza Corporation) discloses a device with reservoir and<br>
controlling rate membrane, for the administration of nicotine. According to the<br>
disclosure, nicotine is dissolved within said reservoir in a solvent (preferably a<br>
copolymer of ethylene-vinyl acetate) with a concentration below its saturation.<br>
All the devices in the documents above mentioned belong to the type "with<br>
reservoir and controlling rate membrane" and present the disadvantages and<br>
objections previously mentioned. It is important to note that for the controlled drug<br>
flux, these devices need the addition of a controlling membrane and cannot perform<br>
adequately without it. The membrane is located between the drug and the adhesive<br>
layer and it is a fundamental element of the device.<br>
The use of adhesive polymers acting as controlling rate membranes or a<br>
control of the final flux of the drug to the skin has been described.<br>
On the other hand, US 4,769,028 (Lohmann GmbH &amp; Co.) disclose a<br>
device that comprises a reservoir containing several layers, in which the concentration<br>
of the drug is supersaturated and increases layer to layer, as the distance to the<br>
adhesive layer increases. According to the disclosure, the layers of said reservoir can<br>
have the same polymeric composition.<br>
US 4,938,759 (Alza Corporation) discloses a device for the transdermal<br>
administration of drugs moderately soluble in mineral oil and that have a melting<br>
point higher than S0°C, comprising a reservoir layer that consists of a dispersion of<br>
the drug in a ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer in a concentration higher than<br>
saturation. In the same way, US 6,174,545 (Alza Corporation) and US 6,074,665<br>
(LTS Lohmann Therapie-Systeme GMBH) require that the drug should be dispersed<br>
under supersaturated concentrations.<br>
The main disadvantage of this type of device is the use of high amounts of<br>
drug to supersaturate all the layers. As a consequence, the supersaturation can make<br>
the device unstable, producing the crystallisation of the drug and making the device<br>
physically unstable. Moreover, the necessity of using many layers, as for example the<br>
ones required for the device disclosed in US 4,769,028, produce an increase of the<br>
final thickness of the device that impairs its mechanical properties. Finally, this type<br>
of device needs also a complex and extensive manufacture process that can raise the<br>
production costs and consequently the price of the final product<br>
On the other hand, US 4,906,463 and US 5,006,342 disclose the use of a<br>
multiplicity of spaced structural layers, to provide better mechanical properties in a<br>
device for transdermal administration. The main disadvantage of mis type of device<br>
is that it often presents a high inter-patient variability for the delivery of the drug,<br>
which makes it unsuitable for treatments with drugs whose application window<br>
should be strictly fixed (see for example Anesthesiology, 83,459-469 (1995)).<br>
WO 0126705 (Samyang Corporation) disclose a device for the transdermal<br>
administration of drugs that comprises two layers of adhesive, wherein each layer is<br>
positioned adjacent to the other, containing each one the same drug and being both<br>
laminated over the same backing layer.<br>
Additionally, WO 0139754 (Pierre Fabre Medicament) disclose adhesive<br>
patches comprising two chambers such that the first chamber is a reservoir-type<br>
transdermal device and the second chamber is matrix-type transdermal device located<br>
at the periphery of the first chamber. Said two chambers contain the same active<br>
substance.<br>
Both aforementioned WO applications describe products that are difficult<br>
to manufacture. Besides, as each layer functions independently, both of them should<br>
be in contact with the skin, increasing the surface of the device.<br>
Additionally, it has been described that, in order to achieve optimal<br>
adhesive or retention properties, it possible to combine commercial adhesives to<br>
obtain better formulations. In those prior art documents, it has been stated that using<br>
certain mixtures it is possible to modulate the amount of drug to be used or to increase<br>
or diminish the drug flux of the active drug (see for example US 5,474,783, US<br>
5,656,286, US 5,958,446, US 6,024,976, US 6,221,383, US 6,235,306, WO 0041538).<br>
WO 02/26217 describes, but does not exemplify, a transdermal drug<br>
delivery device having two layers of different composition and a backing layer, called<br>
an adhesive rate controlled system. The layer adhered to the backing is a drug<br>
reservoir and the other layer is a rate controlling layer which in use contacts the skin.<br>
The two layers have different affinity for the drug, the skin-contacting layer having a<br>
lower affinity. The difference of affinity allows the delivery rate to be controlled.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one of the objects of the present invention is to provide an<br>
adhesive matrix- type device for the transdermal administration of an API, which is<br>
physically and chemically stable and provides delivery of a suitable amount of drug<br>
for an extended period of time.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an adhesive matrix-type<br>
device for the transdermal administration of an API that provides a suitable delivery<br>
for therapy without using a rate controlling membrane for the delivery of the API.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an adhesive matrix type<br>
device for the transdermal administration of an API with good mechanical properties<br>
and a suitable surface for the tolerance of the patient<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an adhesive matrix-type<br>
device for the transdermal administration of an API that gives within acceptable limits<br>
a constant and predictable flux.<br>
Finally, another object of the invention is to provide a simple procedure<br>
for manufacture of an adhesive matrix-type device, for the transdermal administration<br>
of active substances.<br>
The present invention solves the problems described above by means of a<br>
transdermal delivery device that comprises two superimposed adhesive layers.<br>
Devices of the invention can show a suitable and stable permeation over a long period<br>
of time without requiring high concentrations of drugs that would imply wasting<br>
(misspending) of the active substance and possible physical instability. This is<br>
especially useful for drugs of high cost.<br>
Without intending to be restricted to any particular theoretical explanation,<br>
we understand that, where a functional polymer is employed in the layer that acts as<br>
reservoir in the present invention, a chemical interaction of an energy higher than the<br>
attractive intermolecular forces required for a simple solubility interaction, between<br>
the functional group of the polymer and the active drug, may exist.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that by the use of two adhesive layers of<br>
selected thickness and affinity for the delivered active substance, both adhesive layers<br>
containing an initial amount of active drug in a particular concentration, it is possible<br>
to obtain a matrix type device with desirable characteristics.<br>
The superposition of the two adhesive layers of different thickness,<br>
composition and interaction with the drug gives as a result a device of particular<br>
useful characteristics, which may not be predictable from the individual behaviour<br>
(performance) of each layer and are not predictable from the resulting behaviour of<br>
the combination of these adhesives in a single layer. The devices of the present<br>
invention can obtain a constant and controlled delivery over the time.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a transdermal delivery device<br>
for the transdermal delivery of an active substance, for example a pharmacologically<br>
active substance, the device having first and second superimposed mutually<br>
contacting adhesive layers, of which the first layer is pressure sensitive adhesive and<br>
is in use brought into contact with the skin, the active substance being dissolved in<br>
both layers, wherein the affinity of the first layer for the active substance is between<br>
about 1.15 and about 10 times lowsr than that of the second layer, the percent<br>
saturation of the active substance in both layers being the same and being less than<br>
100%, the first layer having a greater thickness than the second layer.<br>
The device thus has a first layer made of a pressure sensitive adhesive and<br>
a second layer made of a pressure sensitive adhesive or a mixture of pressure sensitive<br>
adhesives, in which one or more active substances are dissolved, where each layer<br>
presents a different adhesive composition and a different affinity for the active<br>
substance or substances and where each adhesive layer has a similar saturation level<br>
of less than 100%. The term "percent saturation" expresses the concentration of the<br>
active substance in the adhesive matrix layer as a percentage of the maximum<br>
concentration (saturation) at a given temperature, e.g. room temperature.<br>
In this way, in the two-layered device of the present invention, the first<br>
layer is designed to be in close contact with the skin of the patient and is the one that<br>
delivers the necessary dose of active substance to obtain the desired pharmacological<br>
action, while the second layer is effective to replenish the loss of active substance<br>
from the first layer when the device is in contact with the skin. We have found that<br>
the use of a first layer which is thicker man the second one enables us to obtain a<br>
suitable drug delivery profile with a low or minimum total drug load, thus optimising<br>
product cost. The role of the second layer is to replenish the first layer with drug, as it<br>
is lost from the first layer to the patient, thus achieving a highly constant efflux rate<br>
during the period of use. With its higher drug load, the second layer is thinner.<br>
Although it is preferred that the present invention relates to devices for the<br>
transdermal administration of active substances during continuous long periods of<br>
time, in which the limitation to the passage of the drug is the skin of the patient, the<br>
device can also control by itself the delivery of the drug.<br>
The device of the invention can be used for the administration of active<br>
substances selected from the group of the opioid analgesics and their pharmaceutical<br>
active derivatives and analogues (fentanyl, alfentanyl, sufentanyl, arfentanyl,<br>
lofentanyl, buprenorpbine, nalbuphine, butorphanol and oxicodone). The device of<br>
the invention is especially useful for the transdermal administration of fentanyl.<br>
The device of the present invention can be used for the transdermal<br>
administration of a combination of analgesics, particularly of the ones that belong to<br>
the group mat consists on fentanyl and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or<br>
derivatives. Fentanyl is a well known substance and its pharmacological activity, side<br>
effects and recommended administration dose can be found in specialised literature.<br>
See for example Physician "s Desk Reference, The Merck Index and The Martindale<br>
Extra Pharmacopoeia. The term fentanyl, as well as the designation of each other<br>
active compound mentioned in the present application, include also all of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, including its salts and enantiomers.<br>
Other active substances that can be administered effectively by the device<br>
of the present invention are for example an agent for the treatment of the tobacco<br>
abstinence as for example nicotine, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents,<br>
anaesthetics as for example xylocaine, agonists as for example salbutamol, procaterol<br>
and anticolinergics as for example scopolamine.<br>
The device according to the present invention can be particularly useful to<br>
administer therapeutic drug combinations of two or more active compounds as for<br>
example nalbuphine/fentanyl, butorphanol/sufentanyl, buprenorphine/fentanyl,<br>
oxicodone/ketorolac trometamol and buprenorphine/ ketorolac trometamol.<br>
The mentioned combinations present advantages principally because the<br>
difference between the pharmacokinetics of each drug of the combination may allow a<br>
faster beginning of the action and, at the same time, a longer lasting effect than that<br>
obtained by a device with a single substance.<br>
The active agents are not limited to the aforementioned examples and the<br>
device can be used for the administration of cosmetically active substances. The<br>
amount of active substance is not limited to any specific range, but varies according to<br>
the active substance to be used and can be determined by those skilled in the art<br>
depending on the purpose of the use of the device, for example the amount of active<br>
drug can vary between 0.1 and 40% of weight based on the total weight of the<br>
adhesive layers.<br>
Preferably, a device for the transdermal administration of fentanyl<br>
according to the invention; initially comprises between about 2 and about 4% of<br>
fentanyl in the layer to be in contact with the skin and between about 4 and about 10%<br>
of fentanyl in the second layer, expressed as percentages of the dry weight of each of<br>
the adhesive layers.<br>
The initial concentration given here refers to the state when the device is<br>
ready for use.<br>
Also preferably, a device for the transdermal administration of nicotine<br>
according to the present invention initially comprises between about 2 and about 12%<br>
of nicotine in the layer to be in contact with the skin and between about 5% to about<br>
25% of nicotine in the second layer, expressed as percentages of the dry weight of<br>
each of the adhesive layers.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, a device for the<br>
transdermal administration of sufentanyl initially comprises between about 0.2 and<br>
about 2% of sufentanyl in the layer to be in contact with the skin and between about<br>
5% to about 25% of sufentanyl in the second layer, expressed as percentages of the<br>
dry weight of each of the adhesive layers.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention, a device for the<br>
transdermal administration of alfentanyl initially comprises between about 1 and<br>
about 9% of alfentanyl in the layer to be in contact with the skin and between about<br>
2% to about 12% of alfentanyl in the second layer, expressed as percentages of the<br>
dry weight of each of the adhesive layers.<br>
In the particular case of the drug buprenorphine, a device for the<br>
transdermal administration according to the present invention initially comprises<br>
between about 1 and about 6% of buprenorphine in the layer to be in contact with the<br>
skin and between about 5% to about 12% of buprenorphine in the second layer,<br>
expressed as percentages of the dry weight of each of the adhesive layers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the device<br>
comprises a first adhesive layer made of a non-functional pressure sensitive adhesive<br>
with a low affinity for the active substance and a second layer made of a functional<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive or a mixture of a functional and non-functional pressure<br>
sensitive adhesives with a higher affinity and higher power of retention of the active<br>
substance. Thus in this embodiment, the adhesive of the first layer is substantially-<br>
free of functional groups, but the presence of a small amount of monomeric units<br>
carrying functional groups can be tolerated if it does not significantly affect the<br>
properties of the layer.<br>
By non-functional pressure sensitive adhesives are meant those polymeric<br>
adhesives that do not have reactive functional groups in the polymeric chain and<br>
particularly those not having carboxylic (-COOH) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. It is<br>
preferable also to exclude amine (primary, secondary and tertiary), keto and silanol<br>
groups, as they may interact with the active substance. Non-limiting examples of this<br>
type of adhesives are the following: Acrylics (for example Duro Tak 87-4098 from<br>
National Starch), polyisobutylenes of low and high molecular weight (for example<br>
Opanol from BASF), polyisobutylenes (for example L-100 sold by Exxon, 4H, 5H<br>
and 6H, sold by Rit-Chem), rubbers of copolymers of styrene, butadiene, isoprene and<br>
silicone elastomers (for example SSAs 7-9800 from Dow Coming).<br>
By acrylics, we mean polyacrylate adhesives which are polymers or<br>
copolymers of acrylic acid esters or methacrylic acid esters as monomers. Other<br>
monomers such as vinyl acetate may be present.<br>

and particularly those that have carboxylic and hydroxyl groups in said chain. Non-<br>
limiting examples of this type of adhesives are the following: i) with -OH groups:<br>

The device of the invention comprises a first adhesive layer that has an<br>
affinity for the active substance or substances between about 1.15 to 10 times lower<br>
than that of the second layer, preferably 1.15 to 1.75 times lower. The term "affinity"<br>
should be understood as-the inverse of-the efflux drug rate, from the matrix to a<br>
suitable aqueous medium, in sink conditions. Those skilled in the art will know, by<br>
means of the suitable measurements, how to select the adhesives or mixtures of them<br>
that will be suitable to fulfil this requirement, for any particular application of the<br>
invention.<br>
Preferably the affinity of said first layer for the active substance is 1.15 to<br>
1.75 times lower than that of the second layer.<br>
The affinity ratio can also be expressed as the solubility ratio.<br>
The thickness of the first layer that will be in contact with the skin should<br>
be thicker than the second layer. Generally, the thickness of each dry adhesive layer<br>
is in the range between about 5 to about 150 µm. Thus for example the thickness of<br>
the first layer when dry is in the range 5 to 125 µm and the thickness of the second<br>
layer when dry is in the range 5 to 75 µm. Preferably, the thickness of each dry layer<br>
will be between about 10 to about 75 µm.<br>
Preferably the ratio of the thickness of the first layer to the thickness of the<br>
second layer is in the range 1.2 to 7.<br>
Preferably the composition of the mixture of pressure sensitive adhesives<br>
of the device comprises around 10 and around 90 % of the functional adhesive and<br>
between around 90 and around 10 % of the non-functional adhesive, said percentages<br>
based on the total weight of the dry adhesive layer. More preferably, it comprises<br>
between around 50 and around 80% of the functional adhesive and between around 50<br>
and around 20 % of the non-functional adhesive, said percentages based on the total<br>
weight of the dry adhesive layer.<br>
An important optional component of the present invention is the<br>
permeation enhancer. Those skilled in the art will know what type of enhancer is<br>
suitable to be used and in what amount. Preferably, the enhancers to use in the<br>
present invention are selected between the following: i) fatty acids: e.g. stearic, oleic,<br>
 lauric, myristic, palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, caproic, caprylic, neodecanoic, ii) fatty<br>
alcohols: e.g. octanol, decanol, lauryl, myristyl, oleyl, palmityl, iii) lower alcohols:<br>
e.g. ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, iv) fatty acid esters: e.g. isopropyl myristate,<br>
isopropyl palmitate, ethyl oleate, glyceryl monooleate, propylene glycol monolaurate,<br>
v) glycols: e.g. propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, butylene glycol, vi) terpenes:<br>
e.g. D-limonene, menthol, eucalyptol,-camphor and vii) others: e.g. azone, water,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, 2-metb.ylpyrrolidine.<br>
By fatty acids and fatty alcohols we mean compounds having preferably 8<br>
to 20 carbon atoms in the chain.<br>
The amount of permeation enhancer that is present in the device of the<br>
invention will vary according to the active substance used and according to the<br>
desired delivery. Preferably, this amount is in the range comprised between around<br>
3.5 and 22%.<br>
One skilled in the art will be able to select the material for the backing<br>
layer to be used in the present invention. Examples not limiting of commercial<br>
backing layers are the following: Polyethylene layer with a thickness between 25 to<br>
100 µm (for example CoTran 9720 and CoTran 9711 from 3M), polyolefin layer with<br>
a thickness between 25 to 100 µm (for example CoTran 9722 from 3M), ethyl-vinyl<br>
acetate layer with a thickness between 25 to 100 µm (for example CoTran 9726 from<br>
3M), pigmented polyester layer with a thickness between 25 to 100 urn (for example<br>
Scotchpack 9723 from 3M), ethyl-vinyl acetate layer with a thickness between 25 to<br>
100 µm (for example CoTran 9702 and CoTran 9728 from 3M), polyolefine foam<br>

thickness between 250 to 2000 µm (for example Foam Tape 9772L), polyurethane<br>
layer with a thickness between 25 to 100 µm (for example Scotchpack 9701 from<br>
3M), multilaminated of aluminised and pigmented polyester, polyethylene and ethyl-<br>

acetate with a thickness between 25 to 100 µm (for example Scotchpack 9732 from<br>
3M), cotton, polyester, rayon, nylon and polyurethane, woven and non-woven fabrics.<br>
Likewise, as release liner can be used, among others, the following:<br>
siliconised polyester liner with a thickness between 25 to 250 µm (for example 1-5<br>
PESTR 6200 P2, DCP-Lohja and Scotchpack 9742 from 3M), teflonated polyester<br>
liner with a thickness between 50 to 250 µm (for example Scotchpack 1022 from 3M)<br>
and a siliconised and aluminised polyester with a thickness between 50 to 250 µm (for<br>

To give some examples of sizes of devices of the invention, the total<br>
surface of the device is the same of the active area, this surface being smaller than 15<br>
cm2 when the dose of the pharmacological active substance released is 25 µg/h,<br>
smaller than 27 cm2 when the dose of the pharmacological active substance released<br>
is 50 µg/h, smaller than 36 cm2 when the dose of the pharmacological active<br>
substance released is 75 µg/h and smaller than 45 cm2 when the dose of the<br>
pharmacological active substance released is 100 µg/h.<br>
Basically, the manufacture of the devices for transdermal administration,<br>
also known as matrix adhesive type medically adhesive patches involves, in summary,<br>
the following steps:<br>
a) Preparation of the adhesive mixture: In this step, the components of the<br>
formulation are mixed between them in order to obtain a solution or an<br>
homogeneous suspension.<br>
b) Spreading-Drying-Laminating: In these steps, the adhesive mixture is<br>
homogeneously spread on a liner with suitable characteristics. This liner,<br>
generally, has one treated surface. It can consist of a fine silicone or other<br>
material layer that will allow it to detach easily from the adhesive layer in<br>
order to expose the adhesive surface of the patch that is fixed to the skin of<br>
the user. The obtained spread layer, that generally is not thicker than 1<br>
mm, is then conducted to an area, oven or drying tunnel where the solvents<br>
of the adhesive polymer are eliminated, obtaining in this way an adhesive<br>
matrix deposited on a liner. Then this is laminated in a process<br>
characterised by the deposit of a second layer on the exposed face of the<br>
adhesive matrix.<br>
c) Cutting: In this step the laminate obtained in the previous step is cut in<br>
patches with suitable shape and surface.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention particularly provides a process for the<br>
manufacture of a device as described above for the transdermal administration of an<br>
active substance, which comprises the following steps:<br>
a. coating and drying a first precursor adhesive layer that will be the second<br>
layer of said device onto a temporary release liner;<br>
b. laminating said first precursor adhesive layer together with the temporary<br>
release film onto a backing layer;<br>
c. coating and laminating onto a final release liner a second precursor<br>
adhesive layer that will be the first layer of said device; and<br>
d. detaching the temporary release film and laminating said second precursor<br>
adhesive layer adhered to the final release liner obtained in (c) to said first<br>
precursor adhesive layer obtained in (b) that is adhered to the backing<br>
layer.<br>
Suitably the respective amounts of said active substance in said first and<br>
second precursor adhesive layers differ from the amounts in said device when ready<br>
for use, and after step (d) the active substance is allowed to equilibrate between the<br>
respective layers.<br>
Although due to internal migration of the pharmacologically active<br>
substance, equilibrium is reached during storage or aging of the device, it is most<br>
preferable that the initial load in each layer of the device is such that the equilibrium<br>
is established from the beginning, in order to avoid the uncertainty of a lag time<br>
between manufacturing and readiness to be used.<br>
BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
As the present invention is susceptible of being performed in several<br>
different ways, some preferred embodiments of the invention are described below.<br>
Nevertheless, it should be understood that the present disclosure should considered as<br>
an exemplification of the principles of the invention but it is not directed to limit the<br>
invention to the examples specifically illustrated.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a conventional matrix-type<br>
transdermal delivery device.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic sectional view of a transdermal delivery device of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figs. 3-to 8 are graphs showing release profiles of drugs from devices<br>
described in the Examples.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIENTS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a typical conventional matrix-type<br>
transdermal delivery device of an active substance that contains a single adhesive<br>
layer. The device comprises a backing layer 1 that acts as a protective layer. It<br>
comprises also a pressure sensitive adhesive layer 2 that contains the dissolved active<br>
drug or drugs and a release liner 3 that is detached before the application of the device<br>
onto the skin.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic view of a device for the transdermal delivery of<br>
drugs, according to the present invention, that comprises two superimposed adhesive<br>
layers. The device has a backing layer 1 that is useful as a protective layer for the<br>
central portion or matrix of the system. The matrix is composed of two different<br>
layers of adhesive matrix: one layer 2 of pressure sensitive adhesive made of for<br>
example a functional adhesive, or a blend of a functional and a non- functional<br>
adhesive, that contains the active drug or drugs dissolved with or without a<br>
permeation enhancer, this layer being superimposed to another adhesive layer 3, made<br>
of for example a pressure sensitive non-functional adhesive that has a lower affinity<br>
for the drug than the layer 2 and that also contains the active drug or drugs with or<br>
without permeation enhancer. The saturation level of the active drug or drugs is<br>
similar in both matrix layers. Typically, the device also comprises a release liner 4<br>
that is detached before the application of the device onto the skin.<br>
In these examples, percentages of components are by weight of dry<br>
components. Details of the adhesive<br>
components employed are given above.<br>
In each example, the concentration of the active substance in the adhesive<br>
layers changes as necessary after manufacture due to migration, so that equilibrium is<br>
established. In the state of equilibrium the percent saturation in each layer is the same<br>
and is less than 100%. We have found that equilibrium is established sufficiently<br>
quickly, e.g. in 4 te 5 days.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of a device with two superimposed layers for the<br>
administration of fentanyl.<br>
i) 0.75 g of fentanyl base (USP), 13.6 g of adhesive polymer solution<br>
Duro Tak 87-4098 (equivalent to 5.25 g of dry polymer), 14.2 g of adhesive polymer<br>
solution Duro Tak 87-2353 (equivalent to 5.25 g of dry polymer) and 1.25 g of lauryl<br>
alcohol are placed in a suitable container. Then, the ingredients are stirred with a<br>
mechanical stirrer to form a homogeneous and limpid solution.<br>
The coating mixture thus obtained is spread in a continuous way on the<br>
siliconised face of a siliconised polyester liner (1-5 PESTR 6200-P2) using a knife<br>
over roll type coater (the gap between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain<br>
a thickness of dry adhesive matrix of about 20 µm).<br>
Then, the coated liner is conducted through a drying tunnel to eliminate<br>
the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5 to 10<br>
minutes at a temperature of about 75°C. Finally the liner coated with the adhesive<br>
layer is laminated with an ethyl-vinyl acetate and polyester liner (Scotchpack 9732).<br>
The obtained laminate is picked up on a roll. It will be the second layer of the bilayer<br>
device.<br>
ii) Separately, 8 g of fentanyl base (USP), 446.7 g of adhesive polymer<br>
solution Duro Tak 87-4098 (equivalent to 172 g of dry polymer) and 20 g of lauryl<br>
alcohol are placed in a suitable container. Then the ingredients are stirred with a<br>
mechanical stirrer until a homogeneous and limpid solution is obtained. The mixture<br>
obtained is spread in a continuous way on the siliconised face of a siliconised <br>
polyester liner (1-5 PESTR 6200-P2) using a knife over roll type coater (the gap<br>
between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain a thickness of dry adhesive<br>
matrix of about 50 µm). Then, the wet material is conducted through a drying tunnel<br>
to eliminate the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5<br>
to 10 mmutes-at a temperature of about 75°C. The obtained laminate will be the first<br>
layer of the bilayer device.<br>
iii) The first layer is laminated on the second one (after the detachment of<br>
the release liner 1-5 PESTR 6200-P2 from the second layer). The resultant laminate,<br>
that contains now the two adhesive matrix layers is rewound onto a carton core and<br><br>
then the bulk material is die cut to obtain patches with the shape and surface needed.<br>
The patches obtained are packed in polyester-aluminium-polyethylene envelopes and<br>
stored up to the moment of use.<br>
The device as manufactured thus has the following two layers:-<br>
Adhesive composition of the reservoir layer; 50% FA, 50% N-FA<br>
Adhesive composition of the skin contact layer: 100% N-FA<br>
(Taking into account the thickness of each layer, calculation of the total adhesive<br>
composition gives: 14% FA, 86% N-FA)<br>

4098 (equivalent to 12.25 g of dry polymer), 33.1 g of adhesive polymer solution<br>
Duro Tak 87-2353 (equivalent to 12.25 g of dry polymer) are placed in a suitable<br>
container. Then, the ingredients are stirred with a mechanical stirrer to form a<br>
homogeneous and limpid solution.<br>
The coating mixture obtained is spread in a continuous way on the<br>
siliconised face of a siliconised polyester liner (1-5 PESTR 6200-P2) using a knife<br>
over roll type coater (the gap between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain<br>
a thickness of dry adhesive matrix of about 20 µm).<br>
Then, the coated liner is conducted through a drying tunnel to eliminate<br>
the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5 to 10<br>
minutes at a temperature of about 75°C. Finally the liner coated with the adhesive<br>
layer is laminated with an ethyl-vinyl acetate and polyester liner (Scotchpack 9732).<br>
The obtained laminate is picked up on a roll. It will be the second layer of the bilayer<br>
device.<br>
ii) Separately, 0.15 g of sufentanyl, 38.1 g of adhesive polymer solution<br>
Duro Tak 87-4098 (equivalent to 14.7 g of dry polymer) and 0.15 g of glyceryl<br>
monooleate are placed in a suitable container. Then the ingredients are stirred with a<br>
mechanical starrer until a homogeneous and limpid solution is obtained. The mixture<br>
obtained is spread in a continuous way on the siliconised face of a siliconised<br>
polyester liner (1-5 PBSTR 6200-P2) using a knife over roll type coater (the gap<br>
between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain a thickness of dry adhesive<br>
matrix of about 60 urn). Then, the coated liner is conducted through a drying tunnel<br>
to eliminate the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5<br>
to 10 minutes at a temperature of about 75°C. The obtained laminate is the first layer<br>
of the bilayer.<br>
iii) The first layer is laminated on the second one (after the detachment of<br>
the release liner 1-5 PESTR 6200-P2 from the second layer). The resultant laminate,<br>
that contains now the two adhesive matrix layers is rewound onto a carton core and<br>
then the bulk material is die cut to obtain patches with the shape and surface needed.<br>
The patches obtained are packed in polyester-aluminium-polyethylene envelopes and<br>
stored up to the moment of use.<br>
Example 10: Preparation of a device with two superimposed layers for the<br>
administration of nicotine.<br>
i) 6.0 g of nicotine, 56.8 g of adhesive polymer solution Duro Tak 87-4098<br>
(equivalent to 21.0 g of dry polymer), 17.6 g of adhesive polymer solution Duro Tak<br>
87-2287 (equivalent to 9.0 g of dry polymer) are placed in a suitable container. Then,<br>
the ingredients are stirred with a mechanical stirrer to form a homogeneous and<br>
limpid solution.<br>
The coating mixture obtained is spread in a continuous way on the<br>
siliconised face of a siliconised polyester liner (1-5 PESTR 6200-P2) using a knife<br>
over roll type coater (the gap between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain<br>
a thickness of dry adhesive matrix of about 50 µm).<br>
Then, the coated liner is conducted through a drying tunnel to eliminate<br>
the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5 to 10<br>
minutes at a temperature of about 75°C. Finally the liner coated with the adhesive<br>
layer is laminated with an ethyl-vinyl acetate and polyester liner (Scotchpack 1109).<br>
The obtained laminate is picked up on a roll. It will be the second layer of the bilayer<br>
device.<br>
ii) Separately, 3.0 g of nicotine, 64.7 g of adhesive polymer solution Duro<br>
Tak 87-2287 (equivalent to 33.0 g of dry polymer) and 4.0 g of polyethylene glycol<br>
400 are placed in a suitable container. Then the ingredients are stirred with a<br>
mechanical stirrer until a homogeneous and limpid solution is obtained. The mixture<br>
obtained is spread in a continuous way on the siliconised face of a siliconised<br>
polyester liner (1-5 PESTR 6200-P2) using a knife over roll type coater (the gap<br>
between the knife and the roller is set in order to obtain a thickness of dry adhesive<br>
matrix of about 50 µm). Then, the coated liner is conducted through a drying tunnel<br>
to eliminate the solvents of the polymeric solution, being inside the tunnel between 5<br>
to 10 minutes at a temperature of about 75°C. The obtained laminate is the first layer<br>
of the bilayer device.<br>
iii) The first layer is laminated on the second one (after the detachment of<br>
the release liner 1-5 PESTR 6200-P2 from the second layer). The resultant laminate,<br>
that contains now the two adhesive matrix layers is rewound onto a carton core and<br>
then the bulk material is die cut to obtain patches with the shape and surface needed.<br>
The patches obtained are packed in polyester-aluminium-polyethylene envelopes and<br>
stored up to the moment of use.<br>
Example 11: Dissolution profile of a device according to the present invention.<br>
The dissolution profile of a bilayered device manufactured according to<br>
example 1 was performed. For this assay, a dissolution test apparatus (US<br>
Pharmacopoeia) was used. Samples were collected at 1,4,8,12 and 24 hours after<br>
the start of the experiment and fentanyl content was analysed by HPLC using a<br>
suitable technique. The corresponding profile is in Fig. 3.<br>
The drug delivery from a transdermal matrix device is governed by the<br>
diffusion of the solute within the matrix. According to the accepted Higuchi"s kinetic<br>
model (Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, edited by T.K. Ghosh, W.R.<br>
Pfister and S.I. Yum, Interpharm Press Inc., USA, 1997, pp.159-166), the delivery<br>
rate equation is based on Fick"s diffusion laws and predicts a linear relationship<br>
between the amount of drug delivered by area unit and the square root of the time.<br>
From the obtained results, it is seen that the superimposition of layers with different<br>
affinity for the active drug provides a transdermal system that behaves according to<br>
Higuchi"s kinetic model.<br>
Example 12: Comparison of the dissolution profile between a device according to the<br>
present invention and a device with the same polymeric composition coated as a<br>
single layer.<br>
The dissolution profiles of two devices were compared: one was a bilayer<br>
device manufactured according to example 1 and the other a monolayer device<br>
manufactured according to example 6. In particular, the device according to example<br>
6 contains the same total composition of each ingredient as the bilayer device<br>
according to the present invention, with the difference that they are distributed in a<br>
single layer. The compared devices have the same total thickness and surface. The<br>
compositions of the used devices are summarised in the following table:<br>
For the present assay a dissolution test apparatus n°5 (US Pharmacopoeia)<br>
was used Samples were collected at 1,4,8,12 and 24 hours after the start of the<br>
experiment and fentanyl content was analysed by HPLC using a suitable technique.<br>
The corresponding delivery profiles are in Fig. 4.<br>
As was demonstrated in the previous example, the superimposition of<br>
layers with different affinity for the active drug allows to obtain a transdermal system<br>
mat behaves according to Higuchi"s kinetic model, while the monolayer matrix device<br>
does not fulfil that model in the period of time considered.<br>
Besides, for the same total composition, the presence of the components<br>
distributed in a bilayer arrangement allow a control of the delivery of the active drug<br>
that is not obtained by the mixture of the same component arranged in a single layer.<br>
Example 13: Permeation profile of a device according to the present invention.<br>
Permeation was performed using a device manufactured according to<br>
example 1.<br>
Measurements were performed by triplicate using Valia Chien type cells,<br>
with constant stirring in a water bath with a fixed temperature (34°C). Circular pieces<br>
of human female intact skin (stratum comeum, epidermis and dermis) with 2 cm<br>
diameter and 300 µm thickness were used. The solution used consisted of 5.5 ml of a<br>
phosphate buffer isotonic solution adjusted to pH = 6.0. Samples were collected at 24,<br>
32, 48, 56 and 72 hours after the start of the experiment and fentanyl content was<br>
analysed by HPLC using a suitable technique.<br>
The results obtained are shown in Fig. 5.<br>
It is observed mat the device according to the present invention shows a<br>
permeation rate that remains constant up to 72 hours.<br>
Example 14: Comparison of the dissolution profile of a commercial reservoir-type<br>
device (Duragesic®) and devices of different sizes according to Examples 1 and 3 of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The sizes and contents of the devices used are shown in the following<br>
table:<br>
For the present assay a dissolution test apparatus N°5 (US Pharmacopeia)<br>
was used. Samples were collected at 1, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the start of the<br>
experiment and fentanyl content was analysed by HPLC using a suitable technique.<br>
The obtained results, expressed as percentages of drug delivery vs. square root of<br>
time, are shown in Fig. 6 for the devices of Example 1 compared with Duragesic and<br>
Fig. 7 for the devices of Example 3 compared with Duragesic:<br>
From these obtained results, it is shown that by means of the devices of the<br>
present invention, a useful transdermal patch for the administration of drugs can be<br>
obtained. The mentioned device does not require a rate controlling membrane, and it<br>
has a suitable performance with a lower load of drug and a smaller surface than a<br>
commercial fentanyl patch reservoir-type device with rate controlling membrane<br>
(Duragesic®), while it also provides a delivery profile that is equivalent to the<br>
mentioned commercial device. Particularly, from the data of this example, it is shown<br>
that, according to the present invention, it is possible to obtain a patch for the<br>
transdermal administration of fentanyl that has an active area of approximately half<br>
and a total area smaller than a third, compared to a commercial fentanyl device<br>
(Duragesic®), containing approximately 30% less active substance and providing an<br>
equivalent delivery.<br>
Example 15: Comparison of the dissolution profiles of different devices according the<br>
present invention.<br>
The dissolution profiles of different bilayered devices according to the<br>
present invention was performed. They all have the same adhesive composition,<br>
thickness and size, while their initial fentanyl concentration in the second layer is<br>
different.<br>
For the present assay a dissolution test apparatus N°5 (US Pharmacopeia)<br>
was used. Samples were collected at 1,4,8 and 12 hours after the start of the<br>
experiment and fentanyl content was analysed by HPLC using a suitable technique.<br>
The initial active substance composition (expressed as weight percentages of each<br>
layer) of the used devices are detailed in the following table:<br>
The profiles are shown in Fig. 8:<br>
By the results obtained it is shown that when the loading of drug is<br>
increased in the second layer, the behaviour of the devices still fulfil Higuchi"s<br>
kinetics model.<br>
Example 16: Adhesive properties of different devices according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
In vitro adhesive properties of devices according to examples 1 to 4 were<br>
studied. The studied properties were measured through the assays of "tack",<br>
"adhesiveness" and "shear adhesion". "Tack" is expressed as the distance a stainless<br>
steel roller rolls on the adhesive surface, when it is rolled down in an inclined ramp at<br>
standard height and inclination. Both "adhesiveness" and "shear adhesion" of the<br>
adhesive matrix are determined using a test bank that consists of a holding for ten<br>
stainless steel plates whose angle from vertical can vary (for the "adhesiveness" assay<br>
a 90° angle was used, while for the "shear adhesion" a 2° one was used). The patches<br>
to be tested are applied to the plated places in the holding, a weight is fixed to the free<br>
side of the patch and the time needed to detach the patch from the plate is measured.<br>
The assay is performed in triplicate and the average of the measured values is<br>
informed. The obtained results are grouped in the following table:<br>
From these results a suitable in vivo adhesive performance can be<br>
predicted and, in consequence, the behaviour that the device will show during its<br>
application in human beings.<br>
