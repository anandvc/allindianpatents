Triazole compounds and their use<br>
The invention relates to triazole compounds and to the use of these compounds. These compounds possess valuable therapeutic properties and can be used for treating diseases which respond to the influence of dopamine D3 receptor ligands.<br>
Compounds of the type which is under discussion here and which possess physiological activity are already known. Thus, WO 94/25013; 96/02520; 97/43262; 97/47602; 98/06699; 98/49145; 98/50363; 98/50364 and 98/51671 describe compounds which act on the dopamine receptors. DE 44 25 144 A, WO 96/30333, WO 97/25324, WO 97/40015, WO 97/47602, WO 97/17326, EP 887 350, EP 779 284 A and Bioorg. &amp; Med, Chem. Letters 9 (1999) 2059-2064 disclose further compounds which possess activity as dopamine D3 receptor ligands. US 4,338,453; 4,408,049 and 4,577,020 disclose triazole compounds which possess antiallergic or antipsychotic activity. WO 93/08799 and WO 94/25013 describe compounds of the type which is under discussion here and which constitute endothelin receptor antagonists. Additional triazole compounds, which inhibit blood platelet aggregation and which have a hypotensive effect are described in Pharmazie  16, (1991), 109-112. Further triazole compounds which possess physiological activity are disclosed in EP 691 342, EP 556 119, WO 97/10210, WO 98/24791, WO 96/31512 and WO 92/20655.<br>
Neurons obtain their information by way of G protein-coupled receptors, inter alia. There are a large number of substances which exert their effect by way of these receptors. One of them is dopamine.<br>
A number of facts about the presence of dopamine, and its physiological function as a neuron transmitter, are known with certainty. Disturbances of the dopaminergic transmitter system result in diseases such as schizophrenia, depression and Parkinson's disease. These, and other, diseases are treated with drugs which interact with the dopamine receptors.<br>
By 199 0, two subtypes of dopamine receptor had been clearly defined pharmacologically, namely the Di and D2 receptors.<br>
More recently, a third subtype has been found, namely the D3 receptor, which appears to mediate some of the effects of the antipsychotic and anti-Parkinson agents (J.C. Schwartz et al., The Dopamine D3 Receptor as a Target for Antipsychotics, in Novel Antipsychotic Drugs, H.Y. Meltzer, Ed. Raven Press, New York<br><br>
1992, pages 135-144; M. Dooley et al,. Drugs and Aging 1998, 12, 495-514) .<br>
Since D3 receptors are chiefly expressed in the limbic system, it is assumed that while a selective D3 ligand would probably have the properties of known antipsychotic agents, it would not have their dopamine D3 receptor-mediated neurological side-effects (P. Sokoloff et al,. Localization and Function of the D3 Dopamine Receptor, Arzneim. Forsch./Drug Res. 42(1), 224 (1992); P. Sokoloff et al. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel Dopamine Receptor (D3) as a Target for Neuroleptics, Nature, 347, 146 (1990)).<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain triazole compounds exhibit a high affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor and a low affinity for the D2 receptor. These compounds are consequently selective D3 ligands.<br>
The present invention relates, therefore, to the compounds of the formula I:<br><br>
R1  is H, C1-C6-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH,<br>
OC1-C6-alkyl, halogen or phenyl, C6-C6-cycloalkyl or phenyl;<br>
R2  is H, C1-C6-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH, OC1-C6-alkyl, halogen or phenyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-alkylthio, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, C3_C6-cycloalkyl, halogen, CN, C00R3, C0NR3R4, NR3R4, SO2R3, S02NR3R4,or an aromatic radical which is selected from phenyl, naphthyl and a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic radical having 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms which are selected, independently of each other, from O, N and S, with it being possible for the aromatic radical to have one or two substituents which are selected, independently of each other, from C1-C6-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH, OC1-C6-alkyl, halogen or phenyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, C6-C6-cycloalkyl, halogen, CN, COR2, NR2R2, NO2, SO2R3, S02NR3R'1 and phenyl which may be substituted by one or two radicals which are selected, independently of each other, from C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, NR3R4, CN, CF3, CHF2 or halogen;<br><br>
R3 and R4 are, independently of each other, H, C1-C6-alkyl, which<br>
may be substituted by OH, OC1-C6-alkyl, halogen or phenyl, or<br>
phenyl; A   is C4-C10-alkylene or Ca-Cio-alkylene which comprises at least<br>
one group Z which is selected from 0, S, C0NR3, COO, CO,<br>

R6, R7 and R2 are, independently of each other, selected from H, C1-C6-alkyl, which may be substituted by OH, OC1-C6-alkyl, which may be substituted by amino, mono- or<br>
di-C1-C4-alkylamino; C1-C6-alkylthio, halogen or phenyl; OH, C1-C6-alkoxy, OCF3, OSO2CF3, SH, C1-C6-alkylthio, C2-C6-alkenyl, C2-C6-alkynyl, halogen, CN, NO2, C02R2, SO2R3, S02NR3R4, where R2 and R' have the abovementioned meanings and may also form together with the N atom to which they are bonded a saturated or unsaturated heterocycle with 5 to 7 ring atoms and 1 or 2 N and/or O heteroatoms, CONR2R2, NHS02R2, NR3R4, a 5- or 6-membered carbocyclic, aromatic or nonaromatic ring and a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic, aromatic or nonaromatic ring with 1 or 2 heteroatoms which are selected, independently of each other, from O, N and S, with the carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring being able to have one or two substituents which are selected, independently of each other, from C1-C6-alkyl, phenyl, phenoxy, halogen, C1-C6-alkoxy, OH, NO2, CF3 and CHF2, and with two of the substituents R2, R2 and R2 being able to form, together with the carbon atoms of the phenyl ring to which they are bonded, a phenyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring which is fused to the phenyl ring with the possibility for one or two of the CH or CH2 groups in the fused ring being replaced by a nitrogen atom, a NH or a N-(C1-C6-alkyl) group;<br>
and the salts thereof with physiologically tolerated acids.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are selective dopamine D3 receptor ligands which act in the limbic system in a regioselective manner and which, as a result of their low affinity for the D2 receptor, have fewer side-effects than do the classic neuroleptic agents, which are D2 receptor antagonists. The<br><br>
compounds can therefore be used for treating diseases which respond to dopamine D3 ligands, i.e. they are effective for treating those diseases in which affecting (modulating) the dopamine D3 receptors leads to an improvement in the clinical picture or to the disease being cured. Examples of such diseases are diseases of the cardiovascular system and the kidneys, diseases of the central nervous system, in particular schizophrenia, affective disorders, neurotic stress and somatoform disorders, psychoses. Parkinsonism, attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity in children, epilepsy, amnesic and cognitive disorders such as learning and memory impairment (impaired cognitive function), anxiety states, dementia, delirium, personality disorders, sleep disturbances (for example restless legs syndrome), disorders of the sex life (male impotence), eating disorders and addictive disorders. Moreover they are useful in the treatment of stroke.<br>
Addictive disorders include the psychological disorders and behavioral disturbances caused by the abuse of psychotropic substances such as pharmaceuticals or drugs, and other addictive disorders such as, for example, compulsive gambling (impulse control disorders not elsewhere classified). Addictive substances are, for example: opioids (for example morphine, heroin, codeine); cocaine; nicotine; alcohol; substances which interact with the GABA chloride channel complex, sedatives, hypnotics or tranquilizers, for example benzodiazepines; LSD; cannabinoids; psychomotor stimulants such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methyl-amphetamine (ecstasy); amphetamine and amphetamine-like substances such as methylphenidate or other stimultants including caffeine.

In the above formulae, Ri, R2, R6, R7, R8  g d X have the meanings given in connection with formula I.<br>
The compounds according to the invention, and the starting materials and the intermediates, can also be prepared in analogy with the methods which are described in the patent publications which were mentioned at the outset.<br>
The above-described reactions are generally effected in a solvent at temperatures of between room temperature and the boiling temperature of the solvent employed. Examples of solvents which can be used are esters, such as ethyl acetate, ethers, such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethoxyethane, toluene, xylene, acetonitrile, ketones, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol.<br>
If desired, the reactions can be carried out in the presence of an acid-binding agent. Suitable acid-binding agents are inorganic bases, such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, or sodium hydrogencarbonate or potassium hydrogencarbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium hydride, or organometallic compounds, such as butyl lithium or alkyl magnesium compounds, or organic bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The latter can also simultaneously serve as the solvent.<br>
Process (f) is effected under reducing conditions, e.g. using sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or triacetoxy borohydride, where appropriate in an acid medium or in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as zinc chloride, or by way of catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
The crude product is isolated in a customary manner, for example by means of filtering, distilling off the solvent or extracting from the reaction mixture, etc. The resulting compounds can be purified in a customary manner, for example by recrystallization from a solvent, by chromatography or by converting into an acid addition compound.<br><br>
The acid addition salts are prepared in a customary manner by-mixing the free base with the corresponding acid, where appropriate in solution in an organic solvent, for example a lower alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, an ether, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, a ketone, such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or an ester, such as ethyl acetate.<br>
For treating the abovementioned diseases, the compounds according to the invention are administered orally or parenterally (subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly or intraperitoneally) in a customary manner. The administration can also be effected through the nasopharyngeal space using vapors or sprays.<br>
The dosage depends on the age, condition and weight of the patient and on the type of administration. As a rule, the daily dose of active compound is from about 10 to 1000 mg per patient and day when administered orally and from about 1 to above 50 0 mg per patient and day when administered parenterally.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which comprise the compounds according to the invention. In the customary pharmacological administration forms, these pharmaceuticals are present in solid or liquid form, for example as tablets, film tablets, capsules, powders, granules, sugar-coated tablets, suppositories, solutions or sprays. In this context, the active compounds can be worked up together with the customary pharmacological auxiliary substances, such as tablet binders, fillers, preservatives, tablet disintegrants, flow-regulating agents,  plasticizers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solvents, retarding agents, antioxidants and/or propellent gases (cf. H. Sucker et al., Pharmazeutische Technologie, Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978). The resulting administration forms normally comprise the active compound in a quantity of from 1 to 99% by weight.<br>
The following examples serve to explain the invention without limiting it.<br>

Biological investigations - receptor binding studies<br>
1)  D3 binding test<br>
Cloned human Da-receptor-expressing CCL 1,3 mouse fibro¬blasts, obtainable from Res. Biochemicals Internat. One Strathmore Rd,, Natick, MA 01760-2418 USA, were used for the binding studies.<br>
Cell preparation<br>
The D3-expressing cells were multiplied in RPMI-1640 contai¬ning 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO No. 041-32400 N); 100 U of penicillin/ml and 0.2% streptomycin (GIBO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS and in¬cubated for 5 min with 0.05% trypsin-containing PBS. After that, the solution was neutralized with medium and the cells were collected by centrifuging at 3 00 g. In order to lyse the<br><br>
cells, the pellet was washed briefly with lysis buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol) and after that in¬cubated, at 40c for 30 min, at a concentration of lO' cells/ml of lysis buffer. The cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 10 min and the pellet was stored in liquid nitrogen.<br>
Binding tests<br>
.For the D3-receptor binding test, the membranes were suspen¬ded in incubation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 \m  quinoli-nol, 0.1% ascorbic acid and 0.1% BSA), at a concentration of approx. 10 cells/250 [il of test mixture, and incubated at 30°C with 0.1 nM i25iodosulpiride in the presence and absence of the test substance. The nonspecific binding was determined using 10- M spiperone.<br>
After 60 min, the free radioligand and the bound radioligand were separated by filtering through GF/B glass fiber filters (Whatman, England) on a Skatron cell harvester (Skatron, Lier, Norway), and the filters were washed with iC6-cold Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4- The radioactivity which had collec¬ted on the filters was quantified using a Packard 2200 CA li¬quid scintillation counter.<br>
The Ki values were determined by means of nonlinear regres¬sion analysis using the LIGAND program.<br>
2)  D2 binding test<br>
Cell culture<br>
HEK-2 93 cells possessing stably expressed human dopamine D2A receptors were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing Glutamix I' and 25 mM HEPES containing 10% fetal calf serum albumin. All the media contained 100 units of penicillin per mol and 100 ng/ml of streptomycin/ml. The cells were maintained at 370c in a moist atmosphere containing 5% CO2.<br>
The cells were prepared for the binding studies by trypsini-zing them (0.05% solution of trypsin) at room temperature for 3-5 minutes. After that, the cells were centrifuged at 2 50 g for 10 minutes and treated with lysis buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) at 4°C for 30 minutes. After centrifu-ging at 250 g for 10 minutes, the residue was stored at -20oc until used.<br><br>
Receptor binding tests<br>
Low affinity state dopamine D2 receptor using isj.gpipej-one (81 TBq/irunol, Du Pont de Nemours, Dreieich)<br>
The test mixtures (1 ml) consisted of 1 x 10 cells in incubation buffer (50 mM Tris, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgClj and 2 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4 with HCl) and 0.1 mM i25i_spiperone (total binding) or additionally 1 |J,M haloperidol (nonspecific binding) or test substance.<br>
After the test mixtures had been incubated at 25°C for 60 minutes, they were filtered through GM/B glass filters (Whatman, England) on a Skatron cell harvester (from Zinsser, Frankfurt), and the filters were washed with iC6-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The radioactivity which had collected on the filters was quanti¬fied using a Packard 2200 CA liquid scintillation counter.<br>
The results were evaluated as described in a).<br>
The Ki values were determined by way of nonlinear regression ana¬lysis using the LIGAND program or by converting the IC50 values using the Cheng and Prusoff formula.<br>
In these tests, the compounds according to the invention exhibit very good affinities for the D3 receptor (
