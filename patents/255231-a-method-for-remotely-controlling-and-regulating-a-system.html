				<td>Method for remotely controlling and/or regulating a system<br>
DESCRIPTION Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to the field of controlling and/or regulating remotely located systems. It relates to a method for remotely controlling and/or regulating a system, in particular an industrial system, in accordance with the preamble of the independent patent claim.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Possible ways of remotely monitoring, controlling and/or regulating are an increasingly important factor in the design in all types of systems, in particular in industrial systems and supply systems, for example in the areas of electricity, water and heat. Such possible ways permit increases in efficiency and flexibility when operating and maintaining the systems, in particular with respect to customer service performances and servicing performances, but also when complex systems are operated normally, if a frequent intervention of operator personnel for fault-free operation of the systems is required. One aspect of the<br>
JU remote monitoring and control relates here to the transmission of information relating to the system, for example in the form of a warning or of an alarm, and subsequent return transmission of instruction information as a reaction of the operator personnel.<br>
EP 617350 discloses methods for remotely controlling heating or air-conditioning systems and for the performance of self-diagnostics with remote <br>
transmission of diagnostic results. During the self-diagnostics, data of the heating or air-conditioning system relating to the diagnostics are sensed, processed and encoded by a communications device and transmitted after a data link has been set up as diagnostic information to an external receiver device, at which they are received, decoded and ultimately processed, displayed, printed out and/or stored. During the remote control, a data link is firstly set up from an external instruction device to the communications device and instruction information is subsequently encoded in the instruction device, transmitted to the communications device, received there and decoded and ultimately processed and/or executed in the communications device and/or a controller and/or regulator of the heating or air-conditioning system. Diagnostic information and/or instruction information can be transmitted here via a direct line, but it is also possible to use existing conventional information transmission systems, for example telecommunications systems of the Deutsche Bundespost such as telephone, fax, Cityruf or the like for the transmission. <br>
A problem with systems which can be remotely controlled and/or regulated is the risk of intervention in the system by unauthorized persons. If the communications device has a link to a public network, for example a telecommunications system of the Deutsche Bundespost, a link can be set up to the communications device by unauthorized persons without relatively great difficulties. If a protocol for encoding/decoding the instruction information is known, unauthorized persons can very easily transmit instruction information to the communications device. If this information is correspondingly executed by the controller and/or regulator, failures or even damage to the system may occur, and also, depending on the system, the surroundings and the environment may, under certain circumstances, also be put at risk or damaged. EP 617350 therefore proposes to carry out user authentication in the communications device before instruction information is actually input. For this purpose, a password or a code number containing the authorization for access to the communications device and thus to the system must be input.<br>
While the risk of access by unauthorized persons can largely be prevented by user authentication, there is nevertheless a certain residual risk. This is in particular the case if the password or the code number is, or becomes known, to unauthorized persons.<br>
One particular risk is also constituted by what are referred to as hacker attacks. These are attacks by unauthorized persons who aim to guess the password and/or code number through repeated attempts. In particular, systems of this kind whose communications devices have links to computer networks are particularly at risk here as the hacker attacks can be automated using computer programs and/or scripts so that a very large number of attempts at guessing a password and/or code number can be carried out within a short time.<br>
The invention relates to a method for remotely controlling and/or regulating devices according to WO 01/72012. In the disclosed method, a communication with a validation code is transmitted by the system to a receiver by means of a communication device. The validation code can be used by the receiver to provide a message to the system with a check code. In the system, the check code can be extracted from the message and the authenticity of the message checked by means of the validation code and check code. Since the validation code and check code are used to authenticate messages and are independent of addresses of the receiving devices, when necessary the same validation code and check code can be used for different devices.<br>
WO 01/48722 discloses a remotely controlled telemetry module which is configured as a sensor and control device. If a message is received by the device, control instructions contained in it are to be carried out only if the message has been dispatched by an authorized person. For this purpose, it is checked whether at least part of the call number of the dispatcher corresponds to a stored authorization call number. This requires the communications network to support the transmission of the dispatcher call number. The identification of the dispatcher takes places independently of the message to be transmitted and also cannot be encrypted together with said message or independently of it. This type of dispatcher identification and authorization therefore provides only a certain degree of security.<br>
US Pat. No. 6'201'996 B1 discloses a method and a device for remotely controlling an industrial system by means of the Internet. For the sake of user security, a password-protected access to the web page of the communication device, an encryption of data to be transmitted via the network and a suitable user authentication process, with which the user obtains access to a regulated web page by means of which he can control the system, are disclosed. The identification of the dispatcher is not an integral component of the message to be transmitted to the web page. Instead, the user authentication is again carried out before granting access to the data to be protected or to the check mechanisms and is carried out independently of the data or instruction information to be protected.<br>
EP 0 930 792 discloses a system and a method for the wireless transmission of status data to a device interface. In order to prevent misuse, identification data of the dispatcher can be transmitted with the message. For this purpose, for example the telephone number of the dispatcher of the message is transmitted.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
For this reason, the object of the invention is to specify a method for remotely controlling and regulating systems which effectively minimizes the risk of manipulation by unauthorized persons and in particular protects against hacker attacks.<br>
The object of the invention is also to specify a reliable method for remotely controlling and/or regulating a system which does not require a user authentication to take place before actual transmission of instruction information, so that said method is simple and efficient.<br>
These objects are achieved by means of a method as claimed in claim 1. A communication which comprises information relating to the system and a validation code is dispatched here by a communication device assigned to the system, preferably to a receiver device which is determined in advance. As soon as the communication device receives a message at a time after the communication has been dispatched, a check code is extracted from this message according to a predefined rule. The origin of the message is checked by means of the validation code and check code taking into account the predefined rule, i.e. it is checked whether the message originates from a receiver of the <br>
- 4b -<br>
communication. It is thus possible to use the validation code and check code to verify whether the received message constitutes a response to the dispatched communication.<br>
In this context, the validation code has a chronologically limited validity and a validity information is added to the validation code.<br>
Only in cases in which it has been successively checked whether the message originates from a receiver of the communication, an instruction information is both extracted from the received message in addition to the check code according to the predefined rule and processed and/or executed by the system.<br>
If, on the other hand, it was not possible to use the validation code and check code to verify that the received message constitutes a response to the dispatched communication, either the instruction information is not extracted at all from the message or the extracted instruction information is ignored. <br>
This object and further objects, advantages and features of the invention become clear from the following detailed description of a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
Brief explanation of the drawing<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a block circuit diagram of a system which can be remotely controlled and/or regulated by means of the method according to the invention.<br>
The reference numerals used in the drawing and their significance are summarized in the list of reference numerals.<br>
Ways of implementing the invention<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of a block circuit diagram of a system 1 which can be remotely controlled and/or regulated in accordance with the inventive method by means of a communications device 2, which has a system interface 21 and a network interface 22, and a receiver device 3. The network interface 22 has in each case at least one means for transmitting and receiving communications and/or messages.<br>
Data relating to the system is collected and, if appropriate, conditioned in the communications device 2, a connected data processing system and/or a subunit of the system 1. The data may relate directly or indirectly to the system 1. Said data may comprise, on the one hand, operating parameters such as, for example, temperatures, pressures, flow rates of substances, configuration parameters such as switch settings or valve settings and, on the other hand, also ambient parameters such as, for example, ambient temperatures or the like. Said data may be, as in the abovementioned examples, individual data items which can be expressed by a single numerical value, but may advantageously also comprise complex data records which are preprocessed by a subunit of the system. Finally, the data is combined to form an information item. Here, the information item may be composed of only a single data item, but it can also be composed of a multiplicity of data items or else be the result of an analysis of data which has been carried out in the communications device 2, the connected data processing system or the system 1 itself.<br>
A communication which contains the information is transmitted to a receiver device 3 by the communications device 2 via the network interface 21 when certain conditions are fulfilled. A condition for the transmission of a communication is preferably an error in the system 1 which is diagnosed when the data is evaluated. However, it is also conceivable that a communication is transmitted independently of a state of the system 1, for example if a parameter which indirectly relates to the system 1, such as the ambient temperature, exceeds or drops below a certain limiting value. In the aforesaid situations, the transmission of the communication constitutes, as it were, an alarm. The communication can, however, also be advantageously transmitted at a fixed time, on a fixed day or on previously determined dates.<br>
A validation code is added to the communication by the communications device 2. For this purpose, the information and validation code are combined in accordance with a first combination rule. This is advantageously carried out by appending information and validation code. If the information and validation code are composed of sequences of characters, predefined control or special characters are advantageously- interposed as a separator during the appending process.<br>
Preferably, the validation code is valid only once and has a limited period of validity. The validation code is generated in a suitable way, for example by means of a random number generator so that it cannot be predicted by unauthorized persons. The limited period of validity and the fact that the validation code is valid only once make the system 1 more difficult to manipulate by unauthorized persons in cases in which the validation code becomes known.<br>
The method according to the invention is continued as soon as a message is received by the communications device 2 via the network interface 21. The communications device 2 then extracts a check code from the message according to a first extraction rule. The origin of the received message is then checked by means of the validation code and the check code. A check code which is identical to the validation code is advantageously used for this purpose. The checking of the origin is then carried out by comparing validation code and check code. To do this, when the communication is dispatched, a copy of the validation code must be stored so that it is available for the comparison when a message is received later. A limited period of validity of the validation code is advantageously made possible in this case by virtue of the fact that a validity information is stored together with the validation code. However, a checking procedure can also be advantageously be used without explicit knowledge of the validation code. Thus, inter alia, specific properties of the validation code can be used for checking, for example its checksum. The check code then only has to be checked for these properties, in the example the checksum.<br>
In addition to the check code, instruction information<br>
is also extracted from the message in accordance with<br>
the first extraction rule. Only when there is<br>
successful checking by means of the validation code and<br>
check code is the instruction information passed on by<br>
the communications device 2 to the system 1 via the<br>
system interface 22 in order to be executed, if<br>
appropriate after previous processing. Here, a control . . - - - - ——« device is preferably provided between the communication<br>
device 2 and system 1, the instruction information<br>
being transmitted to said control device and passed on<br>
from it to the system 1. If the checking was not<br>
successful, the instruction information is ignored.<br>
The first extraction rule is preferably configured in such a way that the check code and instruction information is extracted by cutting out parts of the message.<br>
As is apparent from the previous explanations, one application of the method according to the invention ensures that only a receiver of the communication, and thus of the validation code, is capable of issuing instructions for remotely controlling and/or regulating the system 1. In order to do this, the receiver must firstly extract the validation code from the communication in accordance with a second extraction rule which constitutes a reversal of the first combination rule. From the instructions which it attempts to issue, it can generate a message together with the validation code given knowledge of the first extraction rule and the communication device 2 extracts a check code from this message after it has received it, which check code leads to successful checking of the message and thus to the extraction and implementation of the instruction information. To do this, it must use a second combination rule which ensures this.<br>
In a further preferred configuration of the method according to the invention, dispatcher information is extracted from the message in accordance with a third extraction rule. In the communication device 2, the dispatcher information is checked and the instruction information is passed on from the communication device 2 to the system 1 and/or processed only in the case of successful	dispatcher	identification,	i.e.<br>
correspondence between the dispatcher information and stored dispatcher data of authorized users. The dispatcher information preferably contains here a secret password or a secret code number. In this case, the operation is what is referred to as a strong user authentication, i.e. the dispatcher is authenticated as an authorized user by virtue of the fact that, on the one hand, he knows something - namely the password or code number - and, on the other hand, he possesses something - in the present case the receiver device 3 to which the communication was transmitted, or alternatively the communication which he has received with the receiver device 3. Here, the receiver of the communication must add, in accordance with a third combination rule, the dispatcher information to a message which he generates.<br>
In one preferred refinement of the method according to the invention, the validation code, check code and/or dispatcher information are transmitted in encrypted form. To do this, the validation code and/or dispatcher information itself is preferably encrypted before it is added to the communication or message in accordance with a first or third combination rule, respectively. <br>
However, the entire communication and/or message can<br>
also advantageously be encrypted. If the communication<br>
device 2 receives an encrypted message, it must firstly<br>
be decrypted. If the check code or dispatcher<br>
information is present in an encrypted form after<br>
extraction from the message, it is to be decrypted. If<br>
the message contains dispatcher information, the risk<br>
of manipulation by unauthorized persons is reduced<br>
further by encrypted transmission because the<br>
dispatcher information cannot readily be acquired from<br>
illegitimately monitored or intercepted messages. Even<br>
if the validity of the validation code is to be subject<br>
to a chronological limitation, encrypted transmission<br>
is advantageous. In this case, validity information can<br>
be added directly to the validation code, for example<br>
by appending. Manipulation of the validity information<br>
by the receiver is ruled out. After decryption of the<br>
message or check code in the communication device 2,<br>
the validity information is available again plain text. It is thus not necessary to store the validity information.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the communication or the message is transmitted or received by means of the short message service (SMS) over a GSM or ISDN network.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the message is received via a public computer network, preferably the Internet.<br>
The means such as communications device 2, network interface 21, system interface 22, receiver device 3 and control device which are used for carrying out the method according to the invention in accordance with the description above are to be understood as functional elements and do not necessarily need to be<br>
embodied as stand-alone physical units. Thus, the method can advantageously also be used to remotely control and/or regulate a system 1 in which the communications device and/or the control device is integrated into the system 1. The communications device 2 can advantageously be integrated into an electronic computing system in which the control device is advantageously also implemented. The electronic computing system is advantageously also used as a data processing system when data relating to the system is acquired and analysed.<br>
The method according to the invention can advantageously also be used in the remote control and/or regulation of computer-based systems such ,as, for example, data processing systems, financial transaction systems or trading systems.<br>
The receiver of the communication will generally be a person. The communication can in this case advantageously also be present in an audible form and comprise, for example, a chronological sequence of information and the validation code. However, it is also conceivable for the receiver to be an electronic device which automatically generates a message with suitable instruction information in response to the communication and transmits it back to the communications device 2.<br>
