				<td>Redispersible Poly er Powder From Polvolefin Dis ersions And The Use Thereof In<br>
Construction Applications<br>
The present invention relates to redispersible polymer powders from polyolefins. More<br>
specifically, it relates to redispersible polymer powders comprising one or more polyolefin,<br>
5 one or more carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer and one or more vinyl ester<br>
copolymer as well as to dry mix compositions containing the same for construction<br>
applications, such as cement tile adhesives, self levelling flooring compositions (SLFC),<br>
sealant slurries, grouts, and repair mortars.<br>
Redispersible polymer powders containing vinyl acetate-ethylene (VAE) polymers,<br>
to acrylics, styrene-butadiene (SB) polymers, vinyl acetate-vinyl versatate (Veova) copolymers<br>
are used in cement containing tile adhesives (CTA) to improve the strength properties of<br>
those CTA compositions. One disadvantage of existing products is that the latex film in the<br>
cement matrix does not contribute to the adhesion strength in the wet stage, such as after<br>
water immersion. In such applications, polymer films with improved hydrolytic stability<br>
15 would be desirable to give enhanced film strength in the wet stage because unlike existing<br>
redispersible polymer powders they would not lose their strength on water aging.<br>
Another way of improving strength properties of tile adhesives in wet conditions is to add<br>
liquid latex to the cement/sand mix. This technology (i.e. for swimming pools) has some<br>
disadvantages over one component drymix formulations which contain a redispersible<br>
20 polymer powder, including uncontrolled dosage, additional mixing step, transport of water<br>
with product, inconvenience of a 2-component system and the aging and biostability of the<br>
liquid latex component.<br>
- US patent publication 2003/0164478 to Fiedler et al. discloses vinyl ester copolymer<br>
redispersible polymer powders that may comprise copolymers of the vinyl esters with olefins<br>
25 and/or alley] acrylates and the modification of the redispersible polymer powder with<br>
carboxylic esters of polyalcohols to of improve the water resistance and hydrophobicity of<br>
polymer powder. The stability of the polymer phase of the redispersible polymer powder in<br>
wet conditions, i.e. in the presence of water, however still needs improvement.<br>
The present inventors have endeavored to solve the problem of providing a redispersible<br>
30 polymer powder for use in construction applications wherein the product polymer powder<br>
provides water resistance and hydrophobicity and, in addition, is stable in the presence of<br>
water and exhibits improved strength after aging in wet conditions.<br>

In accordance with the present invention, redispersible polymer powder compositions<br>
comprise powder particles having one or more polyolefin, from 5 to 50 wt.% of one or more<br>
carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer, based on the total amount of polyolefin and<br>
5 dispersant polymer solids, one or more vinyl ester copolymer and one or more colloidal<br>
stabilizer, such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol. The weight ratio of polyolefin to vinyl<br>
ester copolymer in the redispersible polymer powder may range from 10:90 to 90:10.<br>
Preferably, the redispersible polymer powder further comprises an anti -caking agent, such as,<br>
for example, kaolin.<br>
10 The redispersible polymer powder compositions of the present invention may comprise a<br>
dry mix of the redispersible polymer powders with cement, such as, for example , portland<br>
cement. The amount of the redispersible polymer powder in the dry mix may range from 0.5<br>
to 20 wt.% or, preferably , from I to 10 wt.% or, more preferably , from 1.5 to 5 wt.%, based<br>
on the total weight of the dry mix..<br>
15 The carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer may comprise the copolymerization<br>
product of one or more olefin monomer with from S to 50 wt .%, or, preferably , 10 wt.% or<br>
more, or, more preferably , up to 40 wt.%, based on the total weight of monomers used to<br>
make the copolymer of a carboxylic acid, anhydride or salt monomer in copolymerized form.<br>
Preferably, the carboxylic acid, anhydride or salt monomer is acrylic or methacrylic acid.<br>
20 More preferably, the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer is a copolymer of<br>
ethylene with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.<br>
The present invention further provides methods for making the redispersible polymer<br>
powder particles and compositions thereof comprising forming an aqueous polyolefin<br>
dispersion containing a polyolefin and a carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer,<br>
25 blending theaqueous polyolefin dispersion with a vinyl ester copolymer to form an aqueous<br>
polymer dispersion and drying the resulting aqueous polymer dispersion to form a<br>
redispersible polymer powder . Forming the aqueous polyolefin dispersion comprises<br>
mechanical dispersion, preferably, by extrusion . Mechanical dispersion may comprise<br>
shearing and, if desired, heating a polyolefin and the dispersing agent(s), with or without<br>
30 water, to above its melting temperature (Tm) to make a liquid polyolefin and, if needed,<br>
diluting the liquid polyolefin with water while shearing the resulting mixture to form an<br>
aqueous dispersion, having a volume average particle size of less than 100 μm, for example,<br>
0.3 μm or more , or, 50 μm or less, and from 20 to 75 wt.% of solids.<br>
2<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, as used herein, the term "volume average particle size" of a<br>
polymer dispersion means the volume average particle size distribution as determined in a<br>
known manner by Laser Diffraction, for example, by using a Beckman Coulter LS 230<br>
Particle Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA or a Grimm Microtrac particle size<br>
5 analyzer (Grimm Technologies, Inc., Douglasville, GA). As used herein, the term "average<br>
particle size of a redispersible polymer powder" means the X50 size of the particle size<br>
distribution and represents the median diameter in micrometers, which means that 50% by<br>
weight of the particles are smaller than this diameter. The particle size distribution of the<br>
redispersible polymer powder was measured by laser diffraction using a particle size analyzer<br>
10 "Sympatec Helos" (Sympatee GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, DE) at a measuring range of 1.8 -<br>
350 μm and dispersing the powder by compressed air<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, the measured glass transition temperature<br>
(measured Tg) is used. As used herein, the term "measured Tg" means a T. that is measured<br>
using differential scanning calorimetry or DSC (rate of heating 10°C per minute, T. taken at<br>
15 the midpoint of the inflection). As used herein the term "calculated Tg" refers to the Tg of a<br>
polymer calculated by using the Fox equation (T. G. Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc., Volume 1,<br>
Issue No. 3, page 123 (1956).<br>
As used herein, the term "redispersible polymer powder" refers to any powder made from<br>
a polymer dispersion which when dispersed in water has an average particle size of less than<br>
20 the upper particle size limit in the original dispersion. The term "redispersibility" is defined<br>
as the volume fraction of particles that are less than the upper particle size limit in the<br>
original dispersion.<br>
The present invention provides redispersible powders from a combination of polyolefin<br>
and vinyl ester copolymer for construction applications. Such redispersible polymer powders<br>
25 when used in cement containing tile adhesives (CTAs) have helped to improve the bonding<br>
strength of the CTAs after wet ageing compared to redispersible polymer powders made<br>
solely from the same vinyl ester copolymer in the same proportion of polymer solids. Such<br>
redispersible polymer powders enjoy good hydrolytic stability, especially in the latex film<br>
they form within the cement structure. Moreover, the spray-dried powder was easily<br>
30 redispersed in water.<br>
The redispersible polymer powders of the present invention comprise a carboxyl group<br>
containing dispersant polymer which enables both the formation of a stable polyolefin<br>
dispersion in water and an effective drying step that forms a redispersible polymer powder.<br>
3<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
The carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer may comprise the polymerization product<br>
of any olefin used to make the polyolefin and any ethylenically unsaturated or addition<br>
polymerizable carboxyl group, anhydride or salt containing monomer. Suitable carboxyl<br>
group, anhydride or salt containing monomers may include, for example, acrylic acid,<br>
5 methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid or their anhydrides, preferably acrylic acid.<br>
Examples of suitable carboxyl group containing dispersant polymers are polyolefins having<br>
maleic anhydride grafted thereon. A preferred carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer<br>
is ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer (EAA), such as, for example a copolymer having 80 wt.%<br>
ethylene and 20 wt.% acrylic acid, based on the total weight of the copolymer. More<br>
to preferably, the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer and the polyolefin comprise the<br>
polymerization residue of the same olefin as at least 10 wt.%, preferably, 30 wt.% or more,<br>
based on the total weight of the dispersant polymer. and the polyolefin, respectively.<br>
The carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer may comprise from 5 to 50 wt.%,<br>
based on the total weight of the polymer, of a carboxylic acid, anhydride or salt monomer,<br>
15 preferably, 10 wt.% or more, or, preferably, up to 40 wt.%. An excessive amount of the<br>
carboxylic acid, anhydride or salt monomer would cause the dispersant polymer to lack<br>
sufficient polarity so that it will not interact or absorb onto a polyolefin particle and form a<br>
dispersion. Too little of the carboxylic acid, anhydride or salt monomer would prevent the<br>
resulting dispersant polymer from effectively dispersing a polyolefin in water.<br>
20 Suitable carboxyl group containing dispersant polymers of the present invention may<br>
comprise olefin carboxylic acid polymers, or their salts, such as ethylene carboxylic acid<br>
copolymers such as, preferably, ethylene acrylic acid copolymers or ethylene methacrylic<br>
acid copolymers; copolymers of olefins with alkyl ether carboxylates; or sulfonated<br>
polyolefins. Suitable amounts of the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer may range<br>
25 from 5 to 50_wt.%, based on the total amount of polyolefin and dispersant polymer solids,<br>
preferably, 10 to 40 wt.%, or, more preferably, 30 wt.% or less. For stability, an aqueous<br>
polyolefin dispersion should have at least 5 wt.% of a carboxyl group containing dispersant<br>
polymer, based on the total amount of polyolefin and dispersant polymer solids. Below 10<br>
wt.%, the phase inversion into water of a polyolefin melt or solvent solution may be<br>
30 compromised, fines may settle out from the dispersion, or a less uniform particle size<br>
distribution may result. Suitable polyolefins for use in the present invention may include<br>
polymers and copolymers of C2 to C20 a-olefins, including elastomers. Suitable a-olefins for<br>
making the polyolefins may be such as, for example, ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 3-<br>

decene, 1-dodecene and 1-octadecene such as, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
poly-l-butene, poly-3-methyl-l-butene, poly-3-methyl-l-pentene, poly-4-methyl-l-pentene;<br>
copolymers, including elastomers, of ethylene and at least one C3 to C20 alpha-olefin, C2 to<br>
5 C20 acetylenically unsaturated monomer, and/or a C4 to CIg diolefin such as, for example<br>
ethylene-propylene copolymer, ethylene- l-butane copolymer, and propylene-l-butene<br>
copolymer, copolymers of an alpha-olefin with a conjugated or non-conjugated diene such as,<br>
for example, ethylene-butadiene copolymer and ethylene-ethylidene norbornene copolymer,<br>
ethylene-propylene-butadiene copolymer, ethylene-propylene-dicyclopentadiene copolymer,<br>
10 ethylene-propylene-1,5-hexadiene copolymer, and ethylene-propylene ethylidene norbornene<br>
copolymer. Preferred polyolefins are homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene,<br>
isobutylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. More preferred<br>
polyolefins are polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene-co-octene.<br>
The vinyl ester copolymers suitable for use in the present invention may comprise any<br>
15 copolymer of any vinyl ester, such as a vinyl ester of a 1 to18C, optionally branched, alkanecarboxylic<br>
acid with any of (meth)acrylate ester of a 1 to 1 SC, optionally branched, alcohol,<br>
dienes, olefins, vinyl-aromatics and vinyl halides. The T. of the vinyl ester copolymer may<br>
range from 50°C or below and -20 °C or more. Preferred vinyl ester copolymers comprise<br>
from 2 to 30 wt.%, based on the total weight of the copolymer of the polymerization residue<br>
20 of one or more olefin, such as ethylene or propylene. Preferably, at least one of the olefin<br>
monomers used to make the vinyl ester copolymer is the same as at least one of the olefin<br>
monomers used to make the polyolefin polymer in the present invention. One preferred vinyl<br>
ester copolymer is vinyl acetate ethylene copolymer.<br>
To achieve improved wet ageing, suitable ratios of vinyl ester copolymers to polyolefins<br>
25 in the present invention may range, based on solids, from 10:90 to 90:10, or, preferably, from<br>
30:70 to 70:30, or, more preferably, from 45:55 to 55:45.<br>
Preferably, the redispersible polymer powders of the present invention comprise an anticaking<br>
agent. Examples of anticaking agents include but are not limited to kaolin, calcium<br>
carbonate, magnesium carbonate, talc, gypsum, silica and silicates, and mixtures thereof. The<br>
30 particle sizes of the anticaking agents are preferably in the range of from 100nm to 10μm.<br>
The anticaking agent is preferably of mineral origin. A preferred anticaking agent is kaolin. It<br>
is preferably added in an amount of from 0.5 wt.% up to 40 wt.%, based on the total weight<br>
of polymeric constituents present in the drying step, more preferably, 5 wt.% or more.<br>
5<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
Methods to form the redispersible polymer powders of the present invention comprise<br>
forming an aqueous polyolefin dispersion having the carboxyl group containing dispersant<br>
polymer and the polyolefin in the proportions of the present invention, preferably, without the<br>
use of solvents, combining the polyolefin dispersion with the vinyl ester copolymer and a<br>
5 colloidal stabilizer, and drying to form the redispersible polymer powder.<br>
Suitable polyolefin dispersions may comprise the polyolefin homopolymers and<br>
copolymers described above.<br>
Forming aqueous polyolefin dispersions used to make the redispersible polymer powders<br>
of the present invention may comprise conventional mechanical dispersion of the polyolefin<br>
to in the presence of a carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer and, if desired, a base,<br>
such as an alkali metal hydroxide either in solid or aqueous solution form. Suitable<br>
mechanical dispersion methods may include shearing and, if desired, heating a polyolefin and<br>
the dispersing agent(s), with or without water, above the melting temperature (Tm) of the<br>
polyolefin or at a temperature that with shearing will heat the polyolefin to melt it, to make a<br>
15 liquid polyolefin and, if needed, diluting the liquid polyolefin with water while shearing the<br>
resulting mixture to form an aqueous dispersion, having a weight average particle size of less<br>
than 100 μm, for example, 0.3 am or more, or from 0.5 to 5 μm.<br>
Suitable shearing methods include extrusion and melt kneading in a known manner<br>
including, for example, in a kneader, a Banbury mixer, single-screw extruder, or a multi-<br>
20 screw. The melt kneading may be conducted under the conditions which are typically used<br>
for melt kneading a polyolefin. A preferred melt-kneading machine is, for example, a multi<br>
screw extruder having two or more screws, to which a kneading block can be added at any<br>
position of the screws. If desired, an extruder maybe provided with a first material-supplying<br>
inlet, such as for adding water or base solution, a second material-supplying inlet, such as for<br>
25 the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer and further third and forth materialsupplying<br>
inlets in this order from the upstream to the downstream along the flow direction of<br>
a material to be kneaded. Further, a vacuum vent may be added. In an example, the dispersion<br>
is first diluted to contain about 1 to about 3% by weight of water and then subsequently<br>
further diluted to comprise greater than 25% by weight of water. The further dilution may<br>
30 provide a dispersion with at least about 30% by weight of water.<br>
Exemplary methods for preparing stable aqueous polyolefin dispersions are also<br>
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,360,599, 3,503917, 4,123,403, 5,037,864,<br>
6<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
5,539,021, and WO 2005085331A. Melt kneading methods are disclosed, for example, in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,659 and 6,455,636.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous polyolefm dispersion is formed in the absence of any organic<br>
solvent.<br>
5 In diluting liquid polyolefins, one may first dilute them so as to contain 1 to 3% by weight<br>
of water and then. subsequently further dilute them to comprise greater than 25% by weight of<br>
water. Preferably, the further dilution provides a dispersion with at least about 30% by weight<br>
of water.<br>
Any high shear or melt kneading apparatus known in the art may be used under<br>
10 conditions which are typically used for melt kneading and so is not particularly limited.<br>
Suitable apparati may include a kneader, a Banbury mixer, an extruder, preferably, a twin<br>
screw extruder, or other apparati for generating high shear, such as a homogenizer, e.g.<br>
Gifford-Woods. For example, polyolefin, water and dispersant can be emulsified using a<br>
homogenizer by mixing at nominally 10,000 rpm (3,000 to 20;000 rpm) for 10 minutes (5 to<br>
15 60 minutes) in the presence of a small amount of defoamer, while flashing off any solvent<br>
(preferably not used) by rotary evaporation at 80° C.<br>
An extruder may be provided with a first material-supplying inlet and a second materialsupplying<br>
inlet, and further third and forth material-supplying inlets in this order from<br>
upstream to downstream along the flow direction of a material to be kneaded. Further, if<br>
20 desired, a vacuum vent may be added at an optional position of the extruder.<br>
In an example of extrusion to form a mechanical dispersion, an aqueous solution of<br>
carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer may be delivered to the initial water (IA)<br>
injector of an extruder, such as a Bersfff extruder. The polyolefin may be fed to the<br>
extruder using a loss-in-weight feeder. The melt zone of the extruder may be maintained<br>
25 below the softening temperature of the polyolefin to prevent it from caking at the bottom of<br>
the feed throat and the melt seal from rupturing. The barrel temperatures may be set<br>
substantially above the T. of the polyolefin, e.g. they may be all initially set to 100 °C, or up<br>
to 200°C, and subsequently reduced. For example, a melt zone temperature of 60 °C, an<br>
emulsification zone of 90 °C and a dilution zone of 80 °C may be employed to produce the<br>
30 smallest amount of grit.<br>
Preferably, the mechanical dispersion equipment may comprise a pressurized high shear<br>
device such as a PARR reactor (manufactured by The Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL)<br>
with high shear mixing blades e.g. Cowles blades, a modified extruder system, or rotor stator<br>
7<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
device. For example, a PARR stainless steel pressure reactor with a Cowles blade, or stirrer<br>
blade with serrated teeth, equipped with an optional pulley system to allow mixer speeds of<br>
up to 1830 rpm, or more; heating and cooling devices may also be employed to make the<br>
aqueous polyolefin dispersions. In a preferred mechanical dispersion process, the reactor<br>
5 may be sealed and heated to heat the polyolefin above its Tm and produce a liquid; it may be<br>
heated, for example to 60°C or more, and up to 200°C, so as to induce shear and bring the<br>
temperature of the polyolefin above its Tin. After reaching the temperature the mixture may<br>
be stirred for a sufficient amount of time, e.g. 2 to 30 minutes, to allow sufficient mixing of<br>
the polyolefin and the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer. To this mixture water<br>
10 may be added using a HPLC pump, to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture. Water<br>
addition may be continued while cooling the reactor by air and water, down to a temperature<br>
of, for example 50 °C, with stirring being maintained during the cooling process, to obtain a<br>
substantially homogeneous dispersion. The resultant aqueous dispersion may be collected by<br>
filtration through a 190 pm filter.<br>
15 Suitable polyolefin dispersions for forming the redispersible polymer powders of the<br>
present invention may have a percent solids of from 5% to 75% by volume and a pH of less<br>
than 12, such as, for example 5 or more. The pH can be adjusted either in-situ by adding<br>
alkali to a mixture of polyolefin and the dispersant polymer, or by converting the carboxyl<br>
group containing dispersant polymer to its salt form before adding it to the polyolefin and<br>
20 forming the dispersion.<br>
Vinyl ester copolymers are combined with the polyolefin dispersion of the present<br>
invention in any known manner, such as simple mixing or combining in with the polyolefin<br>
dispersion after it is formed in the apparatus used to make the polyolefin dispersion<br>
Drying the aqueous dispersion to prepare the redispersible polymer powder of the present<br>
25 invention may comprise, for example, spray drying, freeze drying or fluidized-bed drying.<br>
Preferably the aqueous dispersion is spray dried. The solids content of the dispersion to be<br>
spray-dried may generally be from 25 to 65 wt.%, for example, from 35 to 55wt.%,<br>
preferably from 40 to 50wt.%, based on the total weight of the dispersion.<br>
Spray drying can take place in conventional spray drying systems, for example a<br>
30 dispersion may be atomized by using single, two-fluid or multi-fluid nozzles or via a rotating<br>
disk in a stream of drying gas which may be heated. In general, air, nitrogen or nitrogen<br>
enriched air is employed as the drying gas, the inlet temperature of the drying gas is 45°C or<br>
more and does not exceed 200°C, preferably 100°C to 180°C, more preferably from 130 to<br>
8<br>
Docket No. 65 187<br>
170°C. The product outlet temperature may generally be from 30°C to 90° C, preferably<br>
from 40°C to 70°C, depending on the plant, the Tg of the polymeric composition, and the<br>
desired degree of drying.<br>
As a carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer is already included during the<br>
5 dispersion process, for example during the mechanical dispersion, it may not be necessary to<br>
add additional colloidal stabilizer to the dispersion for spray drying. However, to prevent<br>
blocking of the redispersible polymer powder on storage, spray drying is preferably<br>
performed after addition of one or more additional colloidal stabilizers during the dispersion<br>
process as a spraying aid to the dispersion. Any additional colloidal stabilizer added to the<br>
to dispersion for spray drying is preferably added in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
Suitable spraying aids or colloidal stabilizers may include polyinyl alcohols, such as, for<br>
example, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates; polyvinylpyrrolidones; polysaccharides in<br>
water-soluble form, e.g., starches (amylose and amylopectin), celluloses and their<br>
carboxymethyl, methyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl derivatives; proteins such as casein or<br>
15 casemate, soy protein, gelatin; ligninsulfonates; synthetic polymers such as poly(meth)acrylic<br>
acid, copolymers of (meth)acrylates with carboxyl-functional comonomer units,<br>
poly(meth)acrylamide, polyvinylsulfonic acids and their water-soluble copolymers;<br>
melamine-formaldehyde sulfonates, naphthalene-formaldehyde sulfonates, styrene-maleic<br>
acid and vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymers. Polyvinyl alcohols are the preferred colloidal<br>
20 stabilizers and spraying aids.<br>
In general, the total amount of spraying aid or colloidal stabilizer in the redispersible<br>
polymer powder is from 0.01 to 30 wt.%, based on the total polymer in the dispersion<br>
including the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer. Preferably, the total amount of<br>
colloidal stabilizer prior to the drying step is 3 wt.% or more, or, 10 wt.% or more, or up to<br>
25 20 wt.%, based on the total polymer in the dispersion. The amount of colloidal stabilizer may<br>
be reduced as a lower proportion of vinyl ester copolymer and, relatively, a greater amount of<br>
polyolefin dispersion is included in the drying operation.<br>
Additives may be included before drying the polymer dispersion to form the redispersible<br>
polymer powder in any manner as long as a homogenous dispersion mixture is obtained.<br>
30 Further, additives such as surfactants and defoamers, and fillers may be employed, if desired,<br>
and, preferably added in conventional amounts to the aqueous dispersion before drying. For<br>
example, an antifoamer may be employed in an amount of up to 1.5 wt.%, based on the<br>
weight of the polyolefin and vinyl ester copolymer particles in the aqueous dispersion.<br>
9<br>
Docket No. 65187<br>
Conventional superplasticizers may be employed in an amount of at least 0.01 wt.%,<br>
preferably from 5 to 15wt.%, based upon the weight of the water redispersible polymer<br>
powder (RDP).<br>
An anticaking agent (antiblocking agent) may be added to the polymer powder during<br>
5 and/or immediately after drying to increase storage stability, for example in order to prevent<br>
caking and blocking and/or to improve the flow properties of the powder. This addition is<br>
preferably carried out as long as the powder is still finely dispersed, for example still<br>
suspended in the drying fluid or gas.<br>
The produced redispersible polymer powder preferably has an average (X50) particle size<br>
to diameter of from 5 to 100 micrometers, preferably from 20 to 90 micrometers, most<br>
preferably from 50 to 80 micrometers. The X50 size of the particle size distribution of the<br>
redispersible powder depends on drying conditions and drying equipment.<br>
The redispersible polymer powders (RDP) of the present invention may be used in a<br>
variety of construction applications, such as, for example cement containing tile adhesives<br>
t5 (CTA), basecoats for exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) waterproofing membranes,<br>
grouts, sealant slurries, and repair mortars. RDP products with enhanced hydrolytical stability<br>
can also be used in other construction applications where hydrolytical stability is desired, i.e.<br>
one component sealants and tile grouts, self leveling flooring compounds (SLFC).<br>

(48 L/D rotating at 500 rpm) according to the following procedure with the formulation<br>
components for each aqueous dispersion being reported in Table I, below.<br>
The pofYolefin PofYmer and the carboxyl group-containing dispersant polymer were<br>
supplied to the feed throat of the extruder via a Schenck Mechatron loss-in-weight feeder.<br>
25 The base polymer, and the carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer were melted<br>
blended, and then emulsified in the presence of water, and optionally a neutralizing agent<br>
such as KOH. The emulsion phase was then conveyed forward to the dilution and cooling<br>
zone of the extruder where additional water was added to form the aqueous dispersions<br>
having solid level contents in the range of from less than 60 weight percent. The properties<br>
30 of each of the dispersion components were measured, and are reported in Table II.<br>
Additional water was added as the emulsion phase was conveyed down the length of the<br>
extruder where it was combined with more water to dilute it down to final solid levels of less<br>
than 60 weight percent. The base (if present), initial water, and dilution water were all<br>

To make cement containing tile adhesives, the redispersible polymer powders of Table 2,<br>
above, were formulated into cements as set forth in Table 3, below, with a Hobart mixer as<br>
described in EN 196, part 1 (1999). The fresh plaster is prepared in a Hobart mixer. An<br>
amount of 2 kg of dry powder is weighed into a plastic cup. The required amount of water is<br>
1o put into the Hobart bowl. The powder is added and the material mixed at speed 1 for 30 sec.<br>
The Hobart is then stopped for 60 sec. During this time there is some manual scraping from<br>
the wall and the bottom of the bowl in order to mix dry material which was not reached by<br>
the stirrer. The mixer is then started again at speed 1 for another 60 sec. Afterwards the<br>
adhesive is allowed to mature in the mixing bowl for 10 minutes. Finally, the mortar is mixed<br>
15 for another 15 sec. at speed 1. Then the fresh adhesive is ready for testing.<br>

Docket No. 65l 87<br>
Compare Example 3 to Examples 1 and 2, Example 6 to 5, Example 8 to Example 7, and<br>
Example 10 to Example 9. The initial bonding strength of inventive Examples 6, 8 and 10<br>
was surprisingly good even with only 2 wt.% of polymer in the mortar. Inventive Example 3<br>
gave better water immersion strength in comparison to the comparative vinyl ester copolymer<br>
5 in Example 4; this was so even though less polymer was used in Example 3 than in Example<br>
4. In addition, the inventive redispersible polymer powder of Example 3 gave good initial<br>
strength and good strength after heat aging even without an anticaking agent or added<br>
carboxyl group containing dispersant polymer.<br>
