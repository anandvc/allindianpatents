COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
ODOR CONTROL IN AMINE SALT CONTAINING COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification   particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
678/MUMNP/2004<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
19-4-2007<br><br>
The invention concerns cosmetic compositions containing 5  ammonium salts, particularly those with organic acids,<br>
wherein is achieved control of odor emanating from released free amines.<br>
Amines of a sufficiently low molecular weight to be volatile leave an identifiable  odor.  As a class  of materials, 10  volatile amines smell fish-like.  This odor is usually unpleasant.<br>
Volatility and thereby smell is greatly reduced when the amines are quaternized in salt form.  Quaternized amines have found particular usefulness in cosmetic compositions. 15  They have been used as cationic counterions to alpha-<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids.  Representative disclosures include<br>
U.S. Patent 4,105,782, U.S. Patent 4,105,783, U.S. Patent<br>
4,197,316, U.S. Patent 4,234,599 and U.S. Patent 5,091,171<br>
all to Yu and Van Scott.   	  '<br>
20  WO 01/85129 A2 {Cole et al.) disclose the N,N-<br>
dimethylethanolammonium (DMAE) salts of dermatologically active acids.  The latter are identified as alpha-hydroxy acid, ascorbic acid, lipoic acid and combinations thereof. Besides use of a first neutralizing agent such as DMAE, the<br>
25  disclosure suggests use of a^'second neutralizing agent which may be an inorganic (e.g. sodium or potassium hydroxide), an amine (e.g. triethanolamine) or an amino acid (e.g. arginine, lysine or tyrosine).<br><br><br>
Organic acids other than alpha-hydroxy functionalized ones have been disclosed in the cosmetic literature.  For instance, U.S. Patent 5,641,495 (Jokura et al.) discloses in combination a ceramide or pseudoceramide with a dicarboxylic acid and a salt 5  of a dicarboxylic acid.  Malonic acid is the lowest molecular weight species of the group.  The acids can be neutralized with alkanolamines, basic amino acids and ammonia.<br>
Hitherto the art has not focused upon the latent odor problem.<br>
This may have resulted from preoccupation with identifying<br>
10  dermatologically active ingredients, rather than any concern<br>
over aesthetics.	<br>
A particular advantage of the present invention is that a solution is proposed to the problem caused by release of free amine.<br>
15  Thus, according to a first aspect there is provided a cosmetic composition which includes:<br>
(i)   a malonate salt formed from a first amine which is<br>
ammonia or dimethylaminoethanol and malonic acid;<br>
(ii)  a second amine different from the first amine and<br>
20	having a molecular weight no lower than about 100;<br>
and (iii) from about 1% to about 99.9% by weight of a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Now it has been found that formulating a second amine into a 25  cosmetic composition containing a cationic ammonium salt<br><br><br>
(formed by a first amine reacting with malonic acid) prevents release of the first amine as a smelly volatile substance. Release often happens when the cosmetic composition is rubbed into the skin. Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, 5  it is possible that the high pH of skin releases the first amine from the salt thereby giving rise to the odor.<br>
Sometimes a forraulator may desire just the slightest hint of an amine smell as product is rubbed into the skin.  By use of the second amine in measured amount, perhaps in the context of a 10  buffer, the cosmetic formulation can be tweaked to release a finite amount of amine fragrance on rub-in, yet avoid any lingering or continuous odor release.<br>
The second amine is preferred to have a molecular weight of at least 100, preferably greater than 120, more preferably at 15  least 149 and optimally at least 180.<br>
Representative of the second amine are polyethyleneimine, triethanolamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, triisopropanolamine, triethyleneglycol tetramine, tyrosine, glutamine, lysine, arginine and combinations thereof.<br>
20  Advantageously but not necessarily the second amine will have a pKa no larger than the pKa of the first amine in released form.<br>
Typical pKa values are 7.82 and 8.3 0 respectively for such preferred second amines as triethanolamine and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (alternatively known as<br>
25  tromethamine).  Typical of the first amine is dimethylamino-ethanol with pKa of 9.81,<br><br>
First amines of the present invention are ammonia and dimethylethanolamine.  Typical salts of the first amine include ammonium malonate, diammonium malonate, dimethylethanolammonium malonate and bis(dimethylethanolammonium)malonate.<br>
5  Malonate salts of this invention can either be the half or<br>
fully neutralized salts or combinations thereof as represented by general formulas (I) and (II):<br><br>
II<br>
10  wherein X is a protonated first amine.<br>
The present invention can utilize as the first amine neutralized salt, the mono-salt I, di-salt II or mixtures of<br><br>
WO  03/099238	PCT/EP03/05478<br>
these salts.  When mixtures are present the molar ratio of mono-salt I to di-salt II may range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably from about 10:1 to about 1:500, more preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:200, optimally 5  from about 1:1 to about 1:20.<br>
Amounts of the first amine neutralized carboxylic acid salt may range from about 0.0001% to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 15%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 10%, optimally from about 1% to about 8% by weight of 10  the cosmetic composition.<br>
Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of the carrier may range from 1% to 99.9%, preferably from about 70% to about 95%, optimally from about 80% to about 90%.  Among the<br>
15  useful carriers are water, emollients, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, humectants, thickeners and combinations thereof. The carrier may be aqueous, anhydrous or an emulsion. Preferably the compositions are aqueous, especially water and oil emulsions of the W/0 or O/W variety.  Water when<br>
20  present may be in amounts ranging from about 5% to about<br>
95%, preferably from about 20% to about 70%, optimally from about 35% to about 60% by weight.<br>
