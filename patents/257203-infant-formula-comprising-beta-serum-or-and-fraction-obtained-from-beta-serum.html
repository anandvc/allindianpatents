processes for their production<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides dairy products and processes for producing these products.<br>
The dairy products of the present invention include products suitable for use in infant<br>
formulas.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Commercially available infant formulas are typically produced using non-human milk.<br>
However the nutritional composition of human rnilk differs in some respects to that of<br>
non-human milk (such as cow, sheep, buffalo or goat).<br>
Non-human whole milk such as cow, goat or sheep milk, contains a higher proportion of<br>
saturated fatty acids than human milk and is deficient in linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic<br>
acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids that are essential for normal infant growth and<br>
development. Also, butyric acid which is found in milk fat may cause putrid vomit in<br>
infants.<br>
Therefore standard infant formulas are typically produced using low-fat dairy products<br>
such as skim milk. Using a reduced-fat dairy product means undesirable components in<br>
milk fat are not included in the infant formula, but it also means that phospholipid and<br>
(glyco)sphingolipid levels are significantly lower than those in human milk.<br>
Research over the last 5-10 years has shown that increasing phospholipid and<br>
(glyco)sphingolipid levels in infant formulations to levels found in human milk<br>
(particularly ganglioside GMa, ganglioside GD3, ceramides and sphingomyelin) may lead<br>
to:<br>
enhanced gut maturation, thereby reducing the risk of infection;<br>
- prevention of infections by modifying gut intestinal flora and competitively<br>
binding antigens;<br>
- prevention of the development of allergies; and<br>
- optimal neural development.<br>
It is therefore desirable to produce an infant formula containing sufficient levels of<br>
desirable lipids while minimising or eliminating undesirable ingredients.<br>
One means currently used to achieve this is to add lipid-containing extracts and other<br>
individual ingredients to a base formulation thereby producing an infant formula with the<br>
desired nutritional profile. The lipid extracts may be produced using conventional<br>
extraction solvents (for example WO 94/18289 describes a method for extracting<br>
sphingomyelin from a phospholipid-containing fat concentrate using solvent extraction<br>
techniques). Such lipid extracts are expensive to produce. Furthermore, extensive<br>
toxicity and safety studies are required before regulatory approval in some jurisdictions<br>
can be obtained for their use.<br>
Another means used to achieve this goal is to include buttermilk in infant formulas.<br>
Buttermilk is the aqueous by-product stream produced during one of three processes:<br>
(1) Traditional butter manufacture using either the Fritz buttermaking or batch<br>
buttermaking process;<br>
(2) Traditional production of butter-oil (also known as anhydrous milk fat or AMF)<br>
from cream as shown in Figure 1;<br>
(3) Production of butter-oil from cream using a two-sera process as shown in Figure 2,<br>
where the buttermilk is produced by blending the secondary skim and beta-serum<br>
streams together.<br>
Infant formulas containing buttermilk contain lesser amounts of undesirable components<br>
of milk fat than non-human milk, but higher levels of phospholipids and<br>
(glyco)sphingolipids than reduced-fat dairy products. However, the levels of these<br>
desirable lipids are not high enough for buttermilk to be used in a whey-dominant infant<br>
formula in order to achieve phospholipid and (glyco)sphingolipid levels similar to those<br>
in human milk.<br>
Supercritical extraction using carbon dioxide as the solvent is known to extract neutral<br>
lipids from buttermilk powders. Astaire J. C., Ward R., German J. B., and Jimenez-<br>
Flores R. (2003) Concentration of Polar MFGM Lipids from Buttermilk by<br>
Microflltration and Supercritical Fluid Extraction J. Dairy Sci. 86, 2297-2307 describes<br>
the supercritical extraction of buttermilk using carbon dioxide as the solvent to produce a<br>
product rich in protein, and enhanced in levels of polar lipids. However, the buttermilk<br>
powder so produced still has low levels of polar lipids, at a maximum of 2% of the dry<br>
powder mass, and is thus unsuitable for infant formula.<br>
One possible way to provide a suitable product would be to separate the protein<br>
components from the lipid components in a dairy product.<br>
Dimethyl ether (DME) has previously been used in the extraction of lipids from raw egg<br>
yolk (Yano et al US 4,157,404) and dried egg powder (Yano et al US 4,234,619). The<br>
process causes the fractionation of the lipid and protein components into separate streams.<br>
In US 4,157,404, Yano states that while lipids can be extracted from raw egg yolks (75%<br>
moisture content), the proteins are denatured. In US 4,234,619, Yano states that proteins<br>
are not denatured if the egg yolk is dry, but the phospholipids can only be partially<br>
extracted.<br>
WO 2004/066744 describes the extraction of lipids from an aqueous dairy stream using<br>
near critical extraction where dimethyl ether is the solvent. WO 2004/066744 also<br>
discloses that neither supercritical COz or subcritical dimethyl ether can extract lipids in<br>
useful yields from whey protein concentrate (WPC) dairy powders. However, this<br>
document does not disclose the extraction of lipids from powders rich in milk fat globule<br>
membrane material.<br>
Attempts to extract lipids from dairy powder streams with high lactose contents (where<br>
high is at least 30% by mass of the total powder) by extraction using liquefied dimethyl<br>
ether have been unsuccessful.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved or alternative dairy<br>
products that can be used in infant formulations, and/or to at least provide the public with<br>
a useful choice.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to processes for producing dairy products that have lower<br>
levels of neutral lipids, or higher levels of polar lipids, or both. These products may be<br>
used as ingredients in infant formulas.<br>
Thus the invention provides a process for producing a neutral lipid-depleted beta-serum<br>
dairy product comprising the following steps:<br>
(1) providing dried beta-serum; and<br>
(2) subjecting the beta-serum to a near critical carbon dioxide extraction process.<br>
The term "beta-serum" -as used herein means an aqueous dairy ingredient separated from<br>
dairy streams containing greater than 60% fat which have been through phase inversion<br>
from an oil-in-water to a water-in-oil emulsion. Cream is the preferred starting material<br>
for the production of beta-serum. For example beta-serum is produced during the<br>
production of butter-oil (also known as anhydrous milk fat or AMF) from cream as<br>
shown in Figure 2.<br>
Preferably the dried beta-serum is a powder.<br>
Preferably the near critical carbon dioxide pressure is at least 73.2 bar and the<br>
temperature is in the range 304.2 to 373 K (supercritical region); or the carbon dioxide<br>
pressure is greater than or equal to the vapour pressure, and the temperature is in the<br>
range 273 to 304.1 K (subcritical region). More preferably, the carbon dioxide pressure is<br>
at least 250 bar, and the temperature in the range 313 to 353 K.<br>
Preferably the lactose content of beta-serum is reduced before the extraction process.<br>
Preferably the lactose content is reduced by ultrafiltration. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the lactose content is further reduced by diafiltration during<br>
ultrafiltration.<br>

preferably, the lactose content is reduced to less than or equal to 10% (on a dry weight<br>
basis) before the near critical carbon dioxide step.<br>
Preferably the neutral lipid-depleted beta-serum dairy product is enriched in<br>
phospholipids, sphingolipids and glycolipids. Preferably the dairy product comprises<br>
approximately 50-70% protein (TN x 6.38), preferably at least 60% protein (TN x 6.38);<br>
5-25% phospholipids and glycolipid, preferably 15-25% phospholipids and glycolipid;<br>
and 0-10% neutral lipid, preferably approximately 5% neutral lipid. Most preferably the<br>
dairy product comprises less than about 5% neutral lipids.<br>
The invention also provides a process for producing a neutral lipid-depleted dairy product<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
(1) providing a dried high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material;<br>
(2) subjecting the starting material to a near critical carbon dioxide extraction process,<br>
and<br>
subsequently fractionating the dairy product to produce a lipid enriched fraction and a<br>
lipid depleted fraction comprising the step of:<br>
(3) subjecting this lipid-depleted dairy product to a liquid dimethyl ether extraction<br>
process.<br>
Preferably the near critical carbon dioxide pressure is at least 73.2 bar and the<br>
temperature is in the range 304.2 to 373 K (supercritical region); or the carbon dioxide<br>
pressure is greater than or equal to the vapour pressure, and the temperature is hi the<br>
range 273 to 304.1 K (subcritical region). More preferably, the carbon dioxide pressure is<br>
at least 250 bar, and the temperature in the range 313 to 353 K.<br>
Preferably, the dimethyl ether is liquefied and pressurised to a pressure at least equal to<br>
the vapour pressure at the temperature of the extraction, and more preferably is at least 10<br>
bar greater than the vapour pressure. Preferably the temperature is in the range 273 - 373<br>
K, and more preferably in the range 293 - 353 K.<br>
The term "high fat" means containing greater than 10% fat w/w of solids, preferably<br>
greater than 15% fat w/w of solids and most preferably greater than 20% fat w/w of<br>
solids.<br>
The term "low-lactose" means that the lactose content is less than or equal to 30% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). More preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 25% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). More preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 20% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). Most preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 10% (on a<br>
dry weight basis).<br>
Preferably the lactose content of beta-serum is reduced before the extraction process.<br>
Preferably the lactose content is reduced by ultrafiltration. In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the lactose content is further reduced by diafiltration during<br>
ultrafiltration.<br>
Preferably the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is lactose-reduced beta-serum.<br>
Alternatively the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is lactose-reduced buttermilk.<br>
Preferably the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is spray dried before the near<br>
critical carbon dioxide step. Alternatively high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is<br>
freeze-dried or vacuum dried before the near critical carbon dioxide step.<br>
The lipid enriched fraction preferably contains at least 50% phospholipids and glycolipids<br>
and is substantially reduced in neutral lipids. More preferably, the lipid enriched fraction<br>
contains at least 80% phospholipids and glycolipids, and is substantially free of neutral<br>
lipids.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the lipid depleted fraction is enriched in milk fat globule<br>
membrane proteins and contains, on a powder basis 65-79% (TN x 6.38) protein, 8-12%<br>
lactose, 5-11% fat including phospholipids (4-9% of fraction), more preferably about<br>
72% protein (TN x 638), 9% lactose, 8% fat including phospholipids (6% of fraction),<br>
5% ash and 4% moisture.<br>
The invention also provides a process for producing a lipid enriched fraction and a lipid<br>
depleted fraction comprising the following steps:<br>
(1) providing a high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material; and<br>
(2) subjecting the starting material to a liquid dimethyl ether extraction process.<br>
The lipid depleted fraction contains all of the milk fat globule membrane proteins and<br>
therefore could be used in infant formulas to deliver health benefits that are more strongly<br>
associated with milk fat globule membrane protein components.<br>
Preferably, the dimethyl ether is liquefied and pressurised to a pressure at least equal to<br>
the vapour pressure at the temperature of the extraction, and more preferably is at least 10<br>
bar greater than the vapour pressure. Preferably the temperature is in the range 273 - 373<br>
K, and more preferably in the range 293 - 353 K.<br>
The term "high fat" means containing greater than 10% fat w/w of solids, preferably<br>
greater than 15% fat w/w of solids and most preferably greater than 20% fat w/w of<br>
solids.<br>
The term "low-lactose" means that the lactose content is less than or equal to 30% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). More preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 25% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). More preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 20% (on a<br>
dry weight basis). Most preferably, the lactose content is less than or equal to 10% (on a<br>
dry weight basis).<br>
Preferably the lactose content of beta-serum is reduced before the extraction process.<br>
Preferably the lactose content is reduced in beta-serum or the starting material by<br>
ultrafiltration. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the lactose<br>
content is further reduced by diafiltration during ultrafiltration.<br>
Preferably the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is lactose-reduced beta-serum.<br>
Alternatively the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is lactose-reduced buttermilk.<br>
Preferably the high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material is spray dried before the liquid<br>
dimethyl ether extraction step. Alternatively high-fat low-lactose dairy starting material<br>
is freeze-dried or vacuum dried before the liquid dimethyl ether extraction step.<br>
In one embodiment, the lipid enriched fraction contains at least 40% phospholipids and<br>
glycolipids. This process does not take out the neutral lipids first with COj, and because<br>
DME extracts both polar and neutral lipids, the DME lipid extract will contain about the<br>
same ratio of neutral lipid-to-phospholipid as in the feed. For example, for a feed<br>
containing a neutral lipid to phospholipid ratio of about 1.2, the composition of the DME<br>
lipid extract on a 3% moisture basis is 80-90% fat including phospholipids (35-45% of<br>
fraction), 5-9% ash, 2-5% lactose and 2-3% moisture.<br>
The lipid depleted fraction is enriched in milk fat globule membrane proteins and<br>
contains, on a powder basis, about 60-80% protein (TN x 6.38), 6-12% lactose, 5-11% fat<br>
including phospholipids (5-9% of fraction), preferably 73% protein (TN x 6.38), 9%<br>
lactose, 8% fat including phospholipids (7% of fraction), 5% ash and 3% moisture.<br>
The level of protein in the products described in this specification is calculated from the<br>
total nitrogen (TN) in a sample multiplied by a factor of 6.38.<br>
The invention also provides products produced by the processes of the present invention,<br>
and compositions and infant formulas containing such products.<br>
The term "infant formula" as used herein includes formulas designed for infants 0-12<br>
months old, formulas designed for infants 6-12 months old (follow-on-formula) and<br>
formulas designed for toddlers and young children (1-7 years, growing-up milks / milk<br>

The products, compositions and infant formulas of the present invention may be<br>
administered to provide health benefits.<br>
For example, the following health benefits are contemplated:<br>
- enhancing gut maturation<br>
reducing the risk of infection<br>
- modifying gut intestinal flora and competitively binding antigens<br>
preventing infections<br>
- preventing the development of allergies<br>
optimizing neural development<br>
- treating a dermatological condition<br>
- optimizing immune system development<br>
- maintaining optimal immune function<br>
- preventing or treating colon cancer.<br>
The inventors have discovered that the levels of phospholipids and gangliosides in betaserum<br>
make it suitable to be used in the fortification of infant formulas. The inventors<br>
have also discovered that dairy products which are high in fat but low in lactose<br>
(including low-lactose beta-serum) may be processed to reduce the levels of neutral lipids,<br>
or increase the levels of polar lipids, or both, thus creating products which are even more<br>
suitable in the fortification of infant formulas.<br>
The processes described hi the invention utilise processing and extraction techniques<br>
which do not leave toxic residues, therefore further processing of the final dairy product<br>
is not required.<br>
Additionally, the use of ultrafiltration and near critical extraction with carbon dioxide as<br>
the solvent means it should be easier to obtain regulatory approval for the use of this<br>
product as there is minimal or no solvent residue in the product compared with the use of<br>
conventional solvents such as acetone and ethanol. Additionally conventional solvents<br>
extensively denature proteins, making the use of these solvents unsuitable for producing<br>
dairy products for infant formula applications.<br>
The term "dairy" as used herein means of, containing, or concerning milk and its<br>
products. It includes milk produced by humans, cows, buffalo and goats but is not<br>
limited to these animals.<br>
Every substance has its own "critical" point at which the liquid and vapour state of the<br>
substance become identical. Above but close to the critical point of a substance, the<br>
substance is in a fluid state that has properties of both liquids and gases. The fluid has a<br>
density similar to a liquid, and viscosity and diffusivity similar to a gas. The term<br>
"supercritical" as used herein refers to the pressure-temperature region above the critical<br>
point of a substance. The term "subcritical" as used herein refers to the pressuretemperature<br>
region equal to or above the vapour pressure for the liquid, but below the<br>
critical temperature. The term "near critical" as used herein encompasses both<br>
"supercritical" and "subcritical" regions, and refers to pressures and temperatures near<br>
the critical point.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples further illustrate practice of the invention.<br>
Example 1: Extraction of whey protein concentrate powder<br>
This example shows that the extraction of lipids from powder with high concentrations of<br>
whey proteins results in very low yields of lipid. Whey protein concentrate powders<br>
containing 80.26 % by mass protein, 6.83 % by mass lipid, and 3.57% moisture were<br>
extracted with the near critical solvents carbon dioxide, propane, and dimethyl ether<br>
(DME). The solvent, pressure, temperature, mass of solids used, mass of solvent used,<br>
and extract solids and lipid yields are given in table 1.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The lipid yields are very low and an increase in extraction temperature does not increase<br>
the extraction yield to desired levels.<br>
Example 2: Extraction of standard lactose beta serum powders with supercritical<br>
C02<br>
This example shows that extraction of neutral lipids is possible from beta serum powder<br>
with standard lactose content, but that the yield is significantly less than with powders<br>
where the lactose content has been reduced. The protein and total phospholipid content of<br>
the final powder are low. Beta serum powders with the following compositions were<br>
extracted with supercritical C02 at 300 bar and 313 K: batch 1 total protein 29.4 %,<br>
lactose 42.5 %, total fat 19.7 %, moisture 3.1 % and ash 6 %; batch 2 total protein 31.7 %,<br>
lactose 44.6 %, total fat 20.6 %, moisture 2.3 % and ash 6.1 %. The total fat is made up of<br>
neutral lipids, phospholipids, gangliosides, ceramides and cerebrosides, such as<br>
lactosylceramide. The fat extraction results, and mass of phospholipids in the extract are<br>
shown in table 2. Only neutral lipids are extracted by supercritical COa as the other types<br>
of fat, and especially phospholipids, are not soluble in this solvent.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The powder compositions after extraction were: batch 1 total protein 32.0 %, lactose<br>
47.9 %, total fat 13.6 %, moisture 3.8 % and ash 3 %; batch 2 total protein 34.2 %,<br>
lactose 44.2 %, total fat 11.3 %, moisture 3.5 %, and ash 6.3 %.<br>
The powder from batch 2 was tested for whey protein denaturation. It was assumed that<br>
the casein proteins were not denatured. A representative sample of powder was taken, and<br>
mixed with water to give approximately 3 % whey proteins in solution. The caseins were<br>
precipitated at pH 4.6 with hydrochloric acid, and removed from solution by centrifuging.<br>
The composition of the remaining soluble whey proteins was determined by reverse<br>
phase chromatography. The soluble whey proteins decreased from 13.43 g/100 g of<br>
protein in the feed to 8.39 g/100 g of protein hi the extracted powder. There was a very<br>
large decrease in native (undenarured) beta-lactoglobulin. Denaturation of the protein<br>
makes the powder less suitable for infant formula than those products described hi<br>
Example 3.<br>

Example 3: Extraction of low lactose beta serum powders with supercritical CO2<br>
This example shows that extraction of neutral lipids with greater than 90 % yield is<br>
possible from low lactose beta serum powders. The reduction in lactose content of the<br>
beta serum was carried out by ultrafiltration to a volume concentration factor of 8. The<br>
protein and total phospholipid contents of the final powder are high. Low lactose beta<br>
serum powders with the following compositions were extracted with supercritical CO2 at<br>
300 bar and 313 K: batch 3 low lactose total protein 48.3 %, lactose 14.4 %, total fat<br>
30.1 %, moisture 3.0 % and ash 4.8 %; batch 4 total protein 52.0 %, lactose 7.8 %, total<br>
fat 31.9 %, moisture 2.7 % and ash 4.8 %. The fat extraction results, and mass of<br>
phospholipids in the extract are shown in table 3. Only neutral lipids are extracted by<br>
supercritical CO2 as the other types of fat, and especially phospholipids, are not soluble in<br>
this solvent.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The powder compositions after extraction were: batch 3 total protein 57.3 %, lactose<br>
15.1 %, total fat 18.7 %, total phospholipids 14.4 %, moisture 4.1 %, and ash 5.7 %;<br>
batch 4 total protein 61.6 %, lactose 10.1 %, total fat 21.9 %, total phospholipids 16.8 %,<br>
moisture 4.5 %, and ash 5.6 %. Batches 3 and 4 extracted with supercritical CO2 also had<br>
enhanced levels of gangliosides at ~ 0.7 % by mass. The remaining difference between<br>
the total fat in the residual powder, and the phospholipid and ganglioside content, is made<br>
up of mostly ceramides and cerebrosides, especially lactosylceramide.<br>
The powder from batches 3 (low lactose) and 4 (very low lactose) were tested for protein<br>
denaturation to ensure that it was suitable for use in infant formula as per example 2. The<br>

In a preferred embodiment, these infant formulas may be formulated to provide between<br>
2700 and 3000 Id/L.<br>
The invention also provides an infant formula comprising as an ingredient a fraction<br>
obtained from beta-serum enriched in polar lipids or depleted in neutral lipids or both.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The total lipid extract also contained significant levels of ganglioside, at 2.5 % by mass<br>
for batch 4 at 293 K; and 1 % by mass for batch 4 at 323 K. The protein contents of all<br>
powders increased relative to the feed after dimethyl ether extraction. The powder<br>
compositions after CC&gt;2 and dimethyl ether extractions were: batch 2 total protein 34.6 %,<br>
lactose 47.1 %, total fat 8.9 %, total phospholipids 6.3 %, moisture 2.7 %, and ash 6.7 %;<br>
batch 3 total protein 64.4 %, lactose 17.9 %, total fat 8.4 %, total phospholipids 5.7 %,<br>
moisture 3.6 %, and ash 5.4 %; batch 4 total protein 73.2 %, lactose 8.7 %, total fat 7.6 %,<br>
moisture 4.3 %, and. ash 5.1 %. Both powders had significant levels of gangliosides, at<br>
approximately 0.4 % by mass. The remaining difference between the total fat in the<br>
residual powder, and the phospholipid and ganglioside content, is made up of mostly<br>
ceramides and cerebrosides, especially lactosylceramide.<br>
The powder from batches 2 (standard lactose content), 3 (low lactose) and 4 (very low<br>
lactose) after supercritical CC&gt;2 and dimethyl ether extraction were tested for protein<br>
deuaturation as per example 2. The soluble whey proteins decreased from 13.43 g/100 g<br>
of protein for batch 2 to 8.00 g/100 g of protein in the DME extracted powder. The<br>
soluble whey proteins increased from 12.20 g/100 g of protein in the feed to 15.23 g/100<br>
g of protein in the extracted powder for batch 3; and from 12.44 g/100 g of protein in the<br>
feed to 16.98 g/100 g of protein in the extracted powder for batch 4. The lack of protein<br>
denaturation, and the high protein and phospholipid contents of the extracted low lactose<br>
powders make them very suitable for infant formula, Extraction with dimethyl ether has<br>
had the unexpected effect of increasing the apparent whey protein solubility, which is<br>
initially diminished by the removal of lactose from the feed.<br>
Example 5: Extraction of standard and low lactose powders with dimethyl ether<br>
This example shows that the extraction of both neutral lipids and phospholipids hi high<br>
yield from beta serum powder is only possible when the lactose content of the powder has<br>
been reduced when using dimethyl ether as the solvent without previously extracting the<br>
powder with supercritical CO2j and that dimethyl ether extraction temperature influences<br>
the extraction yield. The example also shows that it is possible to control the final<br>
phospholipids content in the powder after extraction by controlling the extraction<br>
temperature. Batch 2 (standard lactose content, feed mass 4245.6 g) with composition as<br>
given in example 2; and batches 3 (low lactose, feed mass 3407.5 g) and 4 (very low<br>
lactose, feed mass 3204.4 g) with compositions as given in example 3 were extracted<br>
with dimethyl ether at 40 bar and 273293 K using 13.426, 12.666 and 13.938 kg<br>
respectively; and then re-extracted with dimethyl ether at 40 bar and 323 K using 15.727,<br>
11.673 and 11.123 kg respectively. The extraction yield results are shown in table 5<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The protein contents of all powders increased relative to the feed after dimethyl ether<br>
extraction, The powder compositions after dimethyl ether extractions were: batch 2 total<br>
protein 34.8 %, lactose 44.2 %, total fat 16.3 %, phospholipids 8.3 %, moisture 2.3 %,<br>
and ash 6.2 %; batch 3 total protein 65.1 %, lactose 15.3 %, total fat 8.3 %, phospholipids<br>
6.7 %, moisture 2.2 %, and ash 5.3 %; batch 4 total protein 73.3 %, lactose 8.8 %, total<br>
fat 8.3 %, total phospholipids 6.8 %, moisture 2.6 %, and ash 5.2 %. For batches 3 and 43<br>
the difference between the total fat and phospholipids content is made up of gangliosides,<br>
ceramides and cerebrosides.<br>
The powder from batches 2 (standard lactose content), 3 (low lactose) and 4 (very low<br>
lactose) after dimethyl ether extraction were tested for protein denaturation as per<br>
example 2. The soluble whey proteins increased from 13.43 g/100 g of protein to 14.38<br>
g/100 g for batch 1; from 12,20 g/100 g of protein in the feed to 15.47 g/100 g of protein<br>
in the extracted powder for batch 3; and from 12.44 g/100 g of protein in the feed to<br>
15.55 g/100 g of protein in the extracted powder for batch 4. The lack of protein<br>
denaturation and the high protein content of the DME extracted low lactose powders<br>
make them suitable for a wide range of food applications, especially sports nutrition.<br>
Extraction with dimethyl ether has had the unexpected .effect of increasing the apparent<br>
whey protein solubility, which is initially diminished by the removal of lactose from the<br>
feed. The extraction yield of total lipids and phospholipids is very low for powder with<br>
high lactose contents (batch 2) when using dimethyl ether alone as the extraction solvent.<br>
The high content of neutral lipids makes this powder less suitable for infant formula.<br>
Example 6: Levels of phospholipids and gangliosides in selected dairy products<br>
The phospholipid content of human milk typically ranges from 200-400 rng/L (Jensen<br>
RG (1989) Textbook' of Gastroenterology and Nutrition in Infancy, 2nd Edition, E.<br>
Lebenthal (Ed), Raven Press Ltd, New York, 157-208).<br>
According to Harzer G, Haug M, Dieterich I &amp; Gentner PR (1983) Changing patterns of<br>
human milk lipids in the course of the lactation and during the day. American Journal of<br>
Clinical Nutrition, 37, 612-621, the phospholipid composition of human milk 36 days<br>
postpartum is phosphatidylcholine (PC) 24.9%, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 27.7%,<br>
phosphatidylserine (PS) 9.3%, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 5.4% and sphingomyelin (SM)<br>
32.4%.<br>
Table 6 shows the phospholipid contents of:<br>
- beta-serum powder (product A),<br>
- low lactose beta-serum powder (product B),<br>
- neutral lipid-depleted beta serum powder (product C), and<br>
- the lipid extract (product D) and residual powder (product E) of product C after<br>
DME extraction.<br>
These products are derived from bovine milk.<br>
Product A (beta-serum powder) was produced using the method illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
Product B (low lactose beta-serum powder) was produced by ultrafiltration of product A.<br>
Product C was produced using the process as described in Example 3. Products D and E<br>
were produced using the process as described for batch 4 in Example 4, except that a<br>
single stage DME extraction was carried out at 55°C.<br>
The total lipid content was measured by a modified Rose-Gottlieb method where the lipid<br>
extracts were vacuum evaporated and freeze-dried cf. oven drying (low temperature<br>
drying minimises the phospholipid hydrolysis that occurs during oven drying due to the<br>
presence of ammonia in the lipid extracts). The total phospholipid content was calculated<br>
by multiplying the phosphorus content of the modified Rose-Gottlieb fat extract by 25.5<br>
(refer McDowell AKR (1958) Phospholipids in New Zealand dairy products. Journal of<br>
Dairy Research, 25, 192-202.)<br>
Individual phospholipids were measured by 31P NMR.<br>
Pan XL &amp; Izumi T (2000) Variation of the ganglioside compositions of human milk,<br>
cow's milk and infant formulas. Early Human Development, 57, 25-31 show that<br>
ganglioside GD3 and ganglioside GM3 account for about 60% of the total gangliosides in<br>
human milk and that the total gangh'oside content of infant formula, as measured by the<br>
lipid-bound sialic acid (LBSA) content, is significantly lower than that of human milk.<br>
The content of ganglioside GD3 plus ganglioside GM3 in human milk ranges from 10-16<br>
mg/L depending on the stage of lactation (Nakano et ai, 2001 Sialic acid in human milk:<br>
Composition and functions. Acta Paediatrica Taiwanica, 42, 11-17). Table 6 shows the<br>
ganglioside GD3 and ganglioside GM3 contents of product A, product B, product C3<br>
product D and product E. The ganglioside GD3 and ganglioside GM3 levels were<br>
calculated as follows: samples were dissolved in choloroform/methanol/water<br>
6:3:0.45 and filtered. The gangliosides were then separated into GM3 and GD3 fractions<br>
by strong anion exchange solid phase extraction and sialic acid quantified by the<br>
Resorcinol method of Svennerholm (Svennerholm, L. 1957. Quantitative estimation of<br>
sialic acids. II. A colorimetric resorcinol-hydrochloric acid method. Biochim. Biophys.<br>
Acta. 24:604-611). The sialic acid levels were .then used to calculate the concentrations of<br>

Example 7: Infant formulas containing selected dairy product<br>
Table 7 shows the percentage of each product (A, B, C, D and E) that needs to be added<br>
to infant formula on a powder basis in order to increase the "total" ganglioside<br>
(ganglioside GD3 plus ganglioside GM3) content of ready-to-feed (RTF) infant formula<br>
(IF) by 16 mg/L.<br>
The assumptions are that the baseline levels of these components in standard infant<br>
formula are 0%, that the infant formula powder is reconstituted to 13% total solids, and<br>
that the density of the RTF IF is 1.0 kg/L.<br>
The beta serum product addition rates shown in Table 7 also increase the individual<br>
phospholipid contents of the infant formula to levels greater than those found in human<br>
milk, the only exception being product E, where the added PE and PS levels are slightly<br>
lower than those found in human milk (base levels of these components in standard infant<br>
formula would probably compensate for these shortfalls). Note that product D could be<br>
1 Estimated from measured values for LLBSP.<br>
2 Estimated from mean values for standard beta serum powder.<br>
3 Estimated. These are the results of another BPC60 sample.<br>
used instead of soy lecithin, which is commonly used to instantise infant formulas,<br>
thereby making them easier to reconstitute.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 8: Infant formulas<br>
Ready-to-feed total solids = 13.0%<br>
Whey-to-casein ratio = 60:40 (whey protein at least 60.0% of total protein)<br>
Protein target6 = 14 g/L<br>
Fat target6'7 = 35.4-37.6 g/L<br>
4 Mean of range reported by Jensen (1989). Individual phospholipids are calculated based on this<br>
mean value and the percentages reported by Harzer et al. (1983).<br>
6 Neutral lipid Is estimated as the difference between the total lipid and phospholipid. This is,<br>
however, an over-estimate as It includes the glycollplds (e.g. ceramldes, gangliosides). To put the<br>
added amount of neutral lipid Into perspective, the ANZFA range for fat In RTF IF is 21600-45000<br>
mg/kg i.e. the impact of added neutral lipid on the balanced fatty acid profile of IF is small,<br>
particularly with products C, D and E.<br>
Based on Similac Advance with Iron and Enfamil LIPIL with Iron levels, noting that the Enfamil<br>
LIPIL with Iron levels were reported as g per 100 cal (cf. g/100 g) so that a RTF energy content of<br>
2800 kJ/L for this product has been assumed.<br>
Estimated levels for Similac and Enfamil products respectively.<br>
Carbohydrate target6 = 72.1-72.9 g/L<br>
These target levels meet the ANZFA energy requirements of infant formula (2700-3000<br>
kJ/L). The difference between the sum of the protein, carbohydrate and fat levels and the<br>
13% total solids target was assumed to be the vitamin and mineral premixes, antioxidants,<br>
lecithin (used to instantise the final infant formula), and possibly nucleotides/nucleosides.<br>
These components typically amounted to about 3% of the powdered infant formula.<br>
The oil mix used in preparing infant formulas typically comprises a blend of vegetable<br>
oils in order to achieve a fatty acid profile close to that of human milk. Vegetable oils that<br>
are commonly used in infant formula are high oleic palm olein, high oleic sunflower oil,<br>
high oleic safflower oil, coconut oil and soy oil. Furthermore, many of the premium<br>
brands also contain fish/microalgal and fungal oils as sources of docosahexaenoic acid<br>
and arachidonic acid respectively.<br>
