In the context of the present specification, the terra "therapy" also includes "prophylaxis'1 unless there are specific indications to the contrary. The terms "therapeutic" and "therapeutically" should be construed accordingly.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
The invention further provides a method of effecting immunosuppression (e.g. in the treatment of allograft rejection) which comprises administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The invention still further provides a method of treating, or reducing the risk of, an airways disease (e.g. asthma or COPD) in a patient suffering from, or at risk of, said disease, which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (1) or a pharxnaceutically-acceptable salt thereof as hereinbefore defined.<br>
For the above-mentioned therapeutic uses the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the disorder indicated. However, in general, for effecting immunosuppression, the daily dosage pf the compound of formula (1) will be in the range from 0.1 mg/kg, preferably from 0.3 mg/kg, more preferably from 0.5 mg/kg and still more preferably from Img/kg up to and including 30 mg/kg. For the treatment of airways diseases, the daily dosage of the compound of formula (1) will typically be in the range from 0.001 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition in which the formula (1) compoundVsalt/solvate (active ingredient) is in association with apharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.

Silver cyanate (13.5 g) suspended in anhydrous toluene (90 ml) under nitrogen was treated dropwise with acetyl chloride (5.34 ml) and stirred vigorously for 30 min. The product of step a) (23 g) dissolved in anhydrous toluene (15 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred for 72 h. Ether (360 ml) was added and the insoluble material was filtered off and washed with a small volume of ether. The combined organic solutions were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried and evaporated. The residue was treated with a solution of sodium methoxide in methanol (25wt%, 64 ml) at room temperature for 72 h. The reaction was cooled in ice and treated with trimethylsilyl chloride (50.8 ml) and stirred at room temperature overnight. All volatiles were removed in vacua and the residue partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. Drying and evaporation of the organic solution left a residue, which was daromatographed (SiOa/2:l isohexane-ethyl acetate then 3:2 isohexane-ethyl acetate) to isolate the major component (12.2 g). This was taken in dry DMF (ISO ml) with potassium carbonate (6.95 g) and methyl iodide (7.1 g) for 72 h at room temperature. The mixture was poured into water (2L), acidified and extracted into ether. Washing with brine, drying and evaporation gave a solid which was boiled in isohexane (200 ml) containing ethyl acetate (3 ml). On cooling the precipitated pale yellow solid was collected and dried, to afford the sub-title compound (10.5 g).

Pharmacological Data<br>
Inhibition of PM A/ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation<br>
The assay for PMA/ionomytin-stimulated PBMC proliferation was performed in 96-wetl<br>
flat-bottomed microtitre plates. Compounds were prepared as lOmM stock solutions in dimethyl sulfbxide. A 50-fold dilution of this was prepared in RPMI and serial dilutions were prepared from this solution. 1 Oul of the 50-fold diluted stock, or dilutions of it, were added to the well to .give concentrations in the assay starting at 9.5p.M and going down. Into each well was placed 1 x 105 PBMC, prepared from human peripheral blood from a single donor, in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% human serum, 2mM glutamtne and penicillin/streptomycin. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (0.5ng/ml final concentration) and ionomycin (500ng/ml final concentration) were added to these cells in supplemented RPMI1640 medium (as above) so that the final volume of the assay was 0.2ml. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% carbon dioxide for 72 hours. 3H-Thymidine (O.SuCi) was added for the final 6 hours of the incubation. The level of radioactivity, incorporated by the cells was then determined and this is a measure of proliferation.<br>
