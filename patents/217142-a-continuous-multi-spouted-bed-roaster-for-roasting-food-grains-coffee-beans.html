				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device useful as a continuous multi spouted bed roaster for roasting food grains/coffee beans.<br>
Roasting of food grains/coffee beans was practiced to impart specific organoleptic characteristics and also for ease of grinding and coffee brew extraction. It is a time-temperature dependent process involving both physical and chemical changes. The degree of roasting plays a vital role in determining aroma and flavor characteristics of the final product.<br>
Commercial type roasting machines are usually conduction types such as, pan roaster, rotating drum type etc. The basic disadvantages of these machines are high metal temperature and long time. The consequence of these high temperature and long time (of 20 to 30 minutes) results in scorching of contents, oil and char deposits on the wall of the roaster, and invariably catching FIRE when doing dark roast. Further, the machines are difficult to clean after processing, resulting in the final product with an acrid-smoky taste. Finally the commercial conduction type roasting process is tedious, slow, and are unhygienic. They are not suitable for handling particulate solids having irregular cavities on the periphery of the grains/coffee beans and also the roasting of wet product in these machines is difficult.<br>
Reference may be made to a number of grains and coffee bean roasting machines commercially available on the market, which are used for coffee bean roasting, cereals and pulses like wheat, rice, bajra and oil seeds etc., such as a fluid bed continuous coffee roaster designed and developed by Sivetz. M, sivetz Coffee Inc., 349 S.W. 4th ST. CORVALLIS, OREGON 97333-U.S.A(ASIC, 14th International Conference on Coffee Science, held at San Francisco, 1991, ASIC proceedings, pp313-317). Wherein, the machines essentially consists of a perforated hot air plenum used to give<br>
hot air jets and either high fluid velocity or vibratory unit is used for material movement and for discharging the final product. The draw backs of these machines are, handling of small batches of material is difficult and use of vibratory unit or high fluid velocity may damage the final product and economically not viable and also no provision is provided for exhaust heat utilisation. Finally these machines capital cost is high.<br>
Reference may be made to a horizontal drum type fluid bed coffee bean roaster, developed by Johannessen. S., Intl. Patent Application , No. WO. 92/12643 Al. These machines essentially consists of a perforated horizontal drum with hot fluid jets, here the drum keeps rotating and mixes the contents of the drum for better gas-solid contact. The draw backs of the machines are occupies more space, handling of small batches of material is difficult and presence of rotating body may damage the product and wear and tear is more and economically not viable.<br>
Reference may be made to another type of fluid bed roaster developed by Koninklijke Douwe Egberts BV, Netherlands patent NL 89 02 486 A. These machines are having cylindrical horizontal trough, fluidization of the material is achieved by providing number of fluid jets on the walls and also on the bottom of the trough. The draw backs of the machine is the requirement of the high fluid velocity to achieve fluidization of the particles which is energy intensive, and the amount of hot fluid used here is more and there is heat loss in the exhaust and no provision is made for heat utilisation. And the other draw back of these machines is the temperature distribution is not desirable and capital cost of the machine is also high.<br>
Another reference may be made to a batch type single jet spouted bed drying and roasting machines developed by Nagaraju. V.D et all. (ASIC, 16th International Conference on Coffee<br>
Science, held at Kyoto city, Japan., 1995, ASIC proceedings, pp 487-491 and Nagaraju. V.D. et all, Journal of Food Engg. , 31 (1997) pp263-270). And single jet spouted bed drier and roaster by Mujumdar, A.S. (1987) Handbook of industrial drying. Marcel dekker, New York, pp 205-208. And Ochoa Martinez, L.A., et all. (1993). Drying of Liquids in a Spouted bed of inert particles, Heat transfer studies. Journal of Food Engg., 20, ppl35-148. The above mentioned type roasters comprises of a vertical cylindrical roasting chamber connected to a conical base with a spouted nozzle at its center and mixing and fluidisation of the product is achieved by a high velocity fluid passing through the central spout. The draw backs of the above machines are, of batch type machines and requires a minimum spoutable bed hight and high air velocity for processing the raw material. Another draw back of the machines is time consuming and tedious since these are batch type.<br>
Though several patents have been reported for high temperature short time (HTST) roasting such as, the fluidized bed roasting and pressure roasting, handling of small quantity material, is difficult and comparatively heat transfer efficiency is also not desirable , and these machines uses more quantity of fluid with higher velocity and vibratory unit for material movement, which is un¬economical.<br>
The necessity for a continuous high temperature short time roaster similar to a continuous multi-spouted bed roaster is very much felt in food industry especially in instant coffee industry.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a device useful as a continuous multi-spouted bed roaster for roasting food grains/coffee beans, which obviates the above noted draw backs.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device which can handle small batches of raw material and roasting process is continuous.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an economically cheaper device for roasting of food grains/coffee beans.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a device which is simple in design and simple to operate.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a system for utilizing the spend hot air for preheating the raw material before it is being roasted, which will provide energy saving on the system.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful as a continuous multi-spouted bed roaster for roasting food grains/coffee beans, comprising a roasting chamber consisting of a horizontal barrel characterized in that the said barrel having a plurality of hot air spouted nozzles on its bottom side length wise so as to feed air at a temperature in the range of 210° to 250° C, the said barrel also having inside it a lengthwise conventional screw conveyor rotatably mounted by means of bearings at the feed and discharge ends of the said barrel, the said screw conveyor being connected to a variable speed prime mover, the said barrel being provided with an inlet hopper at the top of the feeding end and out let at the bottom of the discharge end, the speed of the said screw conveyor is controlled so as to allow the feed to have residence time in the range of 6 to 9 minutes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the hot air spouted nozzles may be connected to a hot air generator.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the prime over used may such as a variable speed<br>
electric motor.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the feed hopper and the discharge outlet may<br>
be provided with controlled valves.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention a replica of the roasting chamber without the hot<br>
air nozzles may be fitted in such a manner so as to use the waste heat from the roasting chamber.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, fig 1. depicts an embodiment of the device of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a device of continuous multi-spouted bed grains/coffee roaster, which comprises of a horizontal stainless steel barrel (1) of diameter 100mm and 2000mm in long having a plurality of spouted nozzles (6) on its bottom side, which is made of roasting chamber, through which a long stainless steel screw (2) runs from one end to other end of the stainless steel barrel and which rotates with the help of variable speed motor (5) at selected speeds. The screw is mounted on roller bearings at its ends.<br>
The Nozzles are integrally connected to the main barrel (1) and with hot air supply barrel (10) which is mounted parallel to the main barrel, through which hot air is equally distributed through all the nozzles simultaneously. Hot air supply barrel is further connected to the hot air generator (8). There is a material discharging chute (11) through which the roasted product can be withdrawn. And there is feeding arrangement (4) with a star valve (3) mechanism by which a controlled quantity of raw material can be admitted in to the system. Air is supplied from a blower (7) gets heated in an electrical heater and made to pass through the supply barrel. As the air enters through<br>
the nozzles fitted at different locations on the bottom of the roasting chamber as multi air jets, material gets fluidized. As the material fluidizes, the screw conveys suspended material from feed end to discharge end. With this combined effect of the screw conveyor and the air fluidization, there will be effective gas-particle contact and which derives the uniform and cleaned roasted product. Finally the roasted product will be discharged through the discharge chute provided at the other end. There are provisions are also made for sensitive temperature probes to record temperatures at required locations on the unit. These temperature probes are fitted on to the recorder (data logger) and measured periodically the inlet temperature, outlet temperature and final product temperature, etc.<br>
Similar to the above setup another arrangement (shown in dotted lines) is mounted above the roaster (1,2,3.respectively), without the hot air nozzles as a preheating system for the raw material. Here the spent hot air from the roaster chamber is made to pass through the system. Hence the moisture level of the raw material can be bring down, before it is being fed to the roaster. Where in raw material is fed through feed hopper of the preheating system and discharged through a discharging chute, from where the pretreated material is further directly fed to the feeding hopper of the roasting chamber through a rotary star valve fitted to the feeding hopper of the roaster. The entire unit is mounted on a rigid mild steel frame (9).<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
Experimental trials has been conducted using coffee beans procured from the local market. Temperature probes are inserted at different locations on the roasting chamber to measure inlet air<br>
temperature, product temperature and spent hot air temperature etc. at different intervals of time. Heater and blower were switched on and set to a steady state conditions such as inlet air temperature and residence. Depends on the type of food grains, its moisture level, properties and behavior, the temperature and the residence time is set by altering the speed of the conveyor and amount of air to be supplied and selection of heating elements. These parameters are set by making use of control switches and variable speed arrangements. The inlet air temperature 250 C and residence time of 9 min are set for coffee beans. The cleaned raw coffee beans is treated by passing it through preheating chamber where the moisture level is reduced and further dried material is fed through rotary star valve to the roasting chamber. Roasted product is received from the discharging chute of the roaster directly and cooled in the stainless steel trays. Finally quality analyses was also made on the final product.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
The second example was exercised by using the ground nut seeds, Wherein the air temperature and residence time set are different. Adjusting air temperature and residence time is achieved as mentioned in the example one. Then , the ground nut seeds is fed to the roasting chamber through a rotary star valve, where the amount of material being admitted to the roasting chamber will be regulated. The ground nut is processed for about 6 min and processed at nearly 160 C.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
In the illustrations of the example -3 , the bengal gram was used and processed in same manner as mentioned in the example-2 and roasting is achieved at an air temperature of 210 C and residence time of 8min.<br>
Finally, it is concluded that the final product from the present device is the better quality product and organoleptic characteristics of the product is comparable to any other products of the<br>
different roasting devices. It is also concluded that, the processing cost is much cheaper than any<br>
other devices mentioned and cleaned, uniform product quality can be achieved using the present<br>
device.<br>
The specific advantages of the present Continuous Multi-spouted Bed Roaster compared to the<br>
above said fluid bed roasters are very good solids mixing, close control over the aroma and flavor<br>
and effective gas-particle contact. It provides clean uniformly roasted product.<br>
