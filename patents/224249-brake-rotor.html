				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to brake rotors, and in particular brake rotors for use on A^ehicles especially road vehicles, and in particular heavy road vehicles such as trucks and lorries.<br>
Known brake rotors include a mounting flange having a plurality of circumferentially equally spaced mounting holes. The holes are used to fix the rotor to a wheel hub of the vehicle. The mounting flange includes a circular central hole which fits over various wheel hub components.<br>
llowever in use, such known brake rotors cafTdevelop radial cracks between an inner edge of the mounting holes and the-mounting flange central hole.<br>
An object of the present invention is to produce a brake rotor which is less susceptible to developing such cracks.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a brake rotor having an annular disc connected to an annular mounting flange, the mounting flange defining a radially irmer flange wall and including a plurality of circumferentially spaced mounting holes, in which the flange wali includes a plurality of recesses, with each recess situated circumferentially bciween adjacent mounting holes in which the brake rotor includes ventilation vanes hetween opposing braking faces of the annular disc with at least some ventilation vanes including inner vane portions which extend inwardly of a radially inner edge of the annular disc.<br>
11 has been found that by providing recesses between each mounting hole, the hoop stresses which develop in use due to differential themial expansion of different parts of the brake roior are reduced. In particular the thenna! stresses in that part of the brake rotor immediately radially inside each mounting hole can be reduced to an extent whereby cracks no longer form.<br><br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:-<br>
Fjgure 1 is an isometric view of a brake rotor according to the present invention,<br>
Figure 2 is an axial view of the rotor of figure 1,<br>
Figiu'e 2A is an enlarged view of figure 2, and<br>
Figure 3 is a cross section view of the rotor of figure 2 taken along the line AA.<br>
With reference to the figures there is shown a brake rotor 10 having an annular disc 12 connected to a generally annular mounting flange 14. In particular, it should be noted that annular disc 12 is connected via annular region 36. Annular region 36 is a continuous annular region. In this case annular region 36 is connected to brake cheek 17.<br>
"Annular disc 12 has brake cheek 16 and 17 which are spaced apart by ventilation vanes 18. The brake cheeks 16 and 17 together with the ventilation vanes 18 define ventilation holes 20. Brake cheeks 16 and 17 define braking faces 16A and 17A respectively.<br>
In use, braking faces 16A and 17A rotate within a recess of a known caliper, mounted, typically on suspension components of a vehicle. Known brake pads are mounted within the caliper and are forced into frictional engagement with braking faces 16A and 17A via a known mechanical/pneumatic/liydraulic system to provide a braking force.<br>
The mounting flange 14 includes a plurality (in this case 12) of mounting holes 22. The mounting holes are circumferentially equispaced and have a pitch circle diameter of B, in this case 192 millimetres.<br>
The mounting holes have a nominal diameter of 17 millimetres and thus the inner edges of the mounting holes define a circle of diameter C in this case 175 millimetres.<br>
The mounting flange further defines a radially inner flange wall 24 in the fomi of an interrupted circle of diameter D, in this case 162 millimetres.<br><br>
The radially inner flange wall is interrupted by axial recesses in the form of grooves 26 with each groove being positioned circumferentially between adjacent mounting holes.<br>
Bach groove has a substantially semicircular radially outemiost end 28 (see figure 2A) with the centre of the semicircle being shown at 30.<br>
Centres 30 define a circle of diameter E, in this case 170 millimetres.<br>
The radius of the semicircular end of the grooves is 7'A millimetres and thus the radially outer edges of the grooves define a circle of diameter F, in this case 185 millimetres.<br>
The radially innermost-edge-of-cheek 16 is positioned at a diameter G, in this ca^^^34 millimetres.<br>
Consideration of figure 2 and the upper half of figure 3 shows that certain ventilation vanes 18A extend radially inwardly only as far as the imier edge of cheek 16.<br>
However, consideration of figure 2 and the lower part of figure 3 show that certain other vanes 18B extend radially inwardly passed the radially inner edge of cheek 16 to a diameter H. in this case approximately 192 millimetres, thus forming an inner vane portion 32. It can be seen that inner vane portion 32 projects axially from the mounting flange 14. Furthemiore, it would be appreciated that vanes 18A are circumferentially aligned with an associated groove 26.<br>
In this embodiment the ventilation vanes 18 are all radially orientated. Note however that in further embodiments the ventilation vanes could be curved.<br>
Consideration of figure 3 shows that the mounting flange 14 has axially outwardly orientated faces 14A and 14B. It would be appreciated that mounting flange 14 is offset to the left when viewing figure 3 relative to the annular disc 12.<br><br>
Furthermore a plane defined by face 14B is situated between the planes defined by brake faces I6A and 17A. Thns mounting flange 14 is offset from, but neverlheless overlaps Willi, [he annular disc 12.<br>
11 ha^ been found that by providing the grooves in the position as indicated, the material 34 (see figure 3) situated between the mounting holes and the radially inner flange wall is subject to lower thermal stresses and hence the likelihood of cracking in tliis region is significantly reduced.<br>
Certain aspects of the geometry of the mounting flange should be noted.<br>
The mounting hole pitch circle diameter B (192 millimetres) is largcLlhanJh^groove end centre pitch circle-diameter E (170 millimetres).<br>
The mounting hole pitch circle diameter B (192 millimetres) is larger than the groove radially outer edge circle diameter F (185 millimetres).<br>
The groov^e end centre pitch circle diameter E (170 millimetres) is less than the circle diameter C (175 niillimetres) defined by the radially innermost portion of the mounting holes.<br>
The diameter of the circle F (185 millimetres) defined by the groove radially outer edges is larger Ilian the diameter of the circle C (175 millimetres) defined by the radially innemiost portion of the mounting holes.<br>
The brake rotor including in particular the inner vane portions 32 is typically cast. Whilst the grooves may also be cast, when they are machined, beneficially the groove radially outer edge circle diameter F (185 millimetres) is designed to be smaller than the circle H (192 millimetres) defined by the inner edge of the inner vane portions 32. This allows for machine of the rotor flange without the requirement to machine the inner vane portions 32.<br><br><br><br><br>
