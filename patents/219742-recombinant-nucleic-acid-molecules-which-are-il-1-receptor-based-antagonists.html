IL-1 RECEPTOR BASED ANTAGONISTS AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING<br>
This application is a Continuation-in-Part of U.S. Application No. 09/787,835, filed March 22, 2001, which is a U.S. National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT/US99/22045, filed September 22, 1999, which claims priority to U.S. Application No. 09/313,942, filed May 19, 1999, now allowed, which claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/101,858 filed September 25, 1998, now abandoned.  Throughout this application various publications are referenced.  The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The CNTF family of cytokines play important roles in a wide variety of physiological processes that provide potential therapeutic applications for both antagonists and agonists.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is the production of cytokine antagonists that are useful in the treatment of cytokine-related diseases or disorders.<br>
Another object of the invention is the use of the disclosed cytokine antagonists for the treatment of cytokine-related diseases or disorders.<br>
Another object of the invention is the construction of several specific IL-1 cytokine antagonists, termed IL-1 Traps, each having different sequences but all being capable of blocking the binding of IL-1 to its receptor, thus functioning as IL-1 antagonists.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Fig. 1:  Human IL-1 Trap blocks the in vivo effects of exogenously administered huIL-1. BALB/c mice were given subcutaneous injection of huIL-1 (0.3 μ-g/kg) at time 0. Twenty-four hours prior to huIL-1 injection, the animals were pre-treated with either vehicle or 150-fold molar excess of huIL-1 Trap.  Two hours prior to sacrifice (26 hrs), the mice were re-challenged with a second injection of huIL-1 (0.3 μg/kg, s.c). Blood samples were collected at various time points and sera were assayed for IL-1 levels (expressed as mean +/- SEM; n=5 per group).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a fusion polypeptide capable of binding a cytokine to form a nonfunctional complex comprising;'(a) a nucleotide sequence encoding a first fusion polypeptide component comprising the amino acid sequence of the cytokine binding portion of the extracellular domain of the specificity determining component of a cytokine's receptor; (b) a nucleotide sequence encoding a second fusion polypeptide component comprising the amino acid sequence of the cytokine binding portion of the extracellular domain of the signal transducing component of a cytokine's receptor; and (c) a nucleotide sequence encoding a third fusion polypeptide component comprising the amino acid sequence of a multimerizing component.<br>
By "cytokine binding portion" what is meant is the minimal portion of the extracellular domain necessary to bind the cytokine.  It is accepted by those of skill in the art that a defining characteristic of a cytokine receptor is the presence of the two fibronectin-like domains that contain canonical cysteines and of the WSXWS box (SE ID NO:26) (Bazan (1990) PNAS 87: 6934-6938). Sequences encoding the extracellular domains of the binding component of the cytokine's receptor and of the signal transducing component of the cytokine's receptor may also be used to create the fusion polypeptide of the invention.   Similarly, longer sequences encoding larger portions of the components of the cytokine's receptor may be used.   However, it is contemplated that fragments smaller than the extracellular domain will function to bind the cytokine and therefore, the invention contemplates fusion polypeptides comprising the minimal portion of the extracellular domain necessary to bind the cytokine as the cytokine binding portion.<br>
The invention comprises a "specificity determining component" of a cytokine's receptor and a "signal transducing component" of the cytokine's receptor.  Regardless of the nomenclature used to designate a particular component or subunit of a cytokine receptor, one skilled in the art would recognize which component or subunit of a receptor is responsible for determining the cellular target of the cytokine, and thus would know which component constitutes the "specificity determining component." Similarly, regardless of the nomenclature used, one of skill in the art would know which component or subunit of a receptor would constitute the "signal transducing component." As used herein, the "signal transducing component" is a component of the native receptor which is not the specificity determining component and which does not bind or weakly binds the cytokine in the absence of the specificity determining component.   In the native receptor, the "signal transducing component1' may participate in signaling.<br>
In preparing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the fusion polypeptide of the invention, the first, second, and third components of the fusion polypeptide are encoded in a single strand of nucleotides which, when expressed by a host vector system, produces a monomeric species of the fusion polypeptide.  The monomers thus expressed then multimerize due to the interactions between the multimerizing components (the third fusion polypeptide components).   Producing the fusion polypeptides in this manner avoids the need for purification of heterodimeric mixtures that would result if the first and second components were produced as separate molecules and then multimerized, Plor example, U.S. Patent No. 5,470,952 issued November 28, 1995 describes the production of<br><br>
hetcrodimeric proteins that function as CNTF or IL-6 antagonists.   The heterodimers are purified from cell lines cotransfected with the appropriate alpha (a) and beta (b) components.   Heterodimers are then separated from homodimers using methods such as passive elution from preparative, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels or by using high pressure cation exchange chromatography.  The need for this purification step is avoided by the methods of the present invention.<br>
In addition, PCT International Application WO 96/11213 published 18 April 1996 entitled Dimeric IL-4 Inhibitors states that the applicant has prepared homodimers in which two IL-4 receptors are bound by a polymeric spacer and has prepared heterodimers in which an IL-4 receptor is linked by a polymeric spacer to an IL-2 receptor gamma chain.  The polymeric spacer described is polyethylene glycol (PEG).   The two receptor components, IL-4R and IL-2Rgamma are separately expressed and purified.  Pegylated homodimers and heterodimers are then produced by joining the components together using bi-functional PEG reagents.  It is an advantage of the present invention that it avoids the need for such time consuming and costly purification and pegylation steps.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first component is upstream of the nucleotide sequence encoding the second component.   In another embodiment of the invention, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first component is downstream of the nucleotide sequence encoding the second component.  Further embodiments of the invention may be prepared in which the order of the first, second and third fusion polypeptide components are rearranged.  For example, if the nucleotide sequence encoding the first component is designated 1, the nucleotide sequence encoding the second component is designated 2, and the nucleotide sequence of the third component is designated 3, then the order of the components in the isolated nucleic acid of the invention as read from 5' to 3' may be any of the following six combinations: 1,2,3; 1,3,2; 2,1,3; 2,3,1; 3,1,2; or 3,2,1.<br>
In specific embodiments of the invention, the cytokine bound by the fusion polypeptide is interleukin-1 (IL-1).<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the multimerizing component comprises an immunoglobulin derived domain. More specifically, the immunoglobulin derived domain may be selected from the group consisting of the Fc domain of IgG, the heavy chain of IgG, and the light chain of IgG.  Even more specifically, immunoglobulin domain may be selected from the group consisting of the Fc domain of IgG1 or IgG4, the heavy chain of IgG1 or IgG4, and the light chain of IgGt or IgG4.  In another embodiment, the multimerizing component may be an Fc domain from which the first five amino acids (including a cysteine) have been removed to produce a multimerizing component referred to as Fc(DCl).  Alternatively, the multimerizing component may be an Fc domain in which a cysteine within the first five amino acids has been substituted for by another amino acid such as, for example, serine or alanine.<br>
The present invention also provides for fusion polypeptides encoded by the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the invention.  Preferably, the fusion polypeptides are in multimeric form, due to the function of the third component, the multimerizing component.  In a preferred embodiment, the multimer is a dimer. Suitable multimerizing components are sequences encoding an immunoglobulin heavy chain hinge region (Takahashi et al. (1982) Cell 29:671-679); immunoglobulin gene sequences,<br><br>
and portions thereof.  In a preferred embodiment of the invention, immunoglobulin gene sequences, especially one encoding the Fc domain, are used to encode the multimerizing component.<br>
The present invention also contemplates a vector which comprises the nucleic acid molecule of the inverftion as described herein.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 encoding a fusion polypeptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ED NO:2, wherein the fusion polypeptide forms a multhner that is capable of binding a cytokine to form a nonfunctional complex; an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:3 encoding a fusion polypeptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:4, wherein the fusion polypeptide forms a multimer that is capable of binding a cytokine to form a nonfunctional complex; and an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:5 encoding a fusion polypeptide having the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:6, wherein the fusion polypeptide forms a multimer that is capable of binding a cytokine to form a nonfunctional complex; as well as fusion polypeptides encoded by the above-described nucleic acid molecules.<br>
Other preferred embodiments of the invention axe isolated nucleic acid molecules having the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO:7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23 encoding fusion polypeptides having the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO:8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22, respectively, wherein each fusion polypeptide forms a multimer that is capable of binding IL-1 to form a non-functional complex.<br>
Also provided is an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid molecule of the invention as described herein, wherein the nucleic acid molecule is operatively linked to an expression control sequence.  Also provided is a host-vector system for the production of a fusion polypeptide which comprises the expression vector of the invention which has been introduced into a host cell suitable for expression of the fusion polypeptide. The suitable host cell may be a bacterial cell such as E. coli, a yeast cell, such as Pichia pastoris^ an insect cell, such as Spodoptera frugiperda, or a mammalian<br>
cell, such as a COS, CHO, 293, BHK orNSO cell.<br>
The present invention also provides for methods of producing the fusion polypeptides of the invention by growing cells of the host-vector systems described herein, under conditions permitting production of the fusion polypeptide and recovering the fusion polypeptide so produced.<br>
The sRa:β1 heterodimers prepared according to the present invention provide effective Traps for their ligands, binding these ligands with affinities in the picomolar range without creating functional intermediates.  The technology described herein may be applied to develop a cytokine Trap for any cytokine that utilizes an α-component that confers specificity, as well as a β component which, when bound to the α-specificity component, has a higher affinity for the cytokine than either component alone.  Accordingly, antagonists according to the invention include antagonists of interleukin 1 (EL-1).<br>
The a and  β receptor extracellular domains may be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. The receptor molecules useful for practicing the present invention may be prepared by cloning and expression in a prokaxyotic or eukaryotic expression system.   The recombinant<br><br>
receptor gene may be expressed and purified utilizing any number of methods.  The gene encoding the factor may be subcloned into a bacterial expression vector, such as for example, but not by way of limitation, pC110.<br>
The recombinant factors may be purified by any technique which* allows for the subsequent formation of a stable, biologically active protein.  For example, and not by way of limitation, the factors may be recovered from cells either as soluble proteins or as inclusion bodies, from which they may be extracted quantitatively by 8M guanidinium hydrochloride and dialysis.  In order to farther purify the factors, conventional ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography,  reverse phase chromatography or gel filtration may be used.<br>
The sRcx:β heterodimeric receptors may be engineered using known fusion regions, as described in published PCT application WO 93/10151 describes production of β receptor heterodimers, or they may be prepared by crosslinking of extracellular domains by chemical means. The domains utilized may consist of the entire extracellular domain of the a and β components, or they may consist of mutants or fragments thereof that maintain the ability to form a complex with its ligand and other components in the sRα:β1 complex.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the extracellular domains are engineered using leucine zippers.   The leucine zipper domains of the human transcription factors c-jun and c-fos have been shown to form stable heterodimers (Busch et al. (1990) Trends Genetics 6:36-40; Gentz et al. (1989) Science 243:1695-1699) with a 1:1 stoichiometry.  Although jun-jun homodimers have also been shown to form, they are about 1000-fold less stable than jun-fos heterodimers.  Fos-fos homodimers have not been detected.<br>
. The leucine zipper domain of either c-jun or c-fos are fused in frame at the C-terminus of the soluble or extracellular domains of the above mentioned receptor components by genetically engineering chimeric genes.  The fusions may be direct or they may employ a flexible linker domain, such as the hinge region of human IgG, or polypeptide linkers consisting of small amino acids such as glycine, serine, threonine or alanine, at various lengths and combinations.  Additionally, the chimeric proteins may be tagged by His-His-His-His-His-His (His6) (SEQ. ID NO:25) to allow rapid purification by metal-chelate chromatography, and/or by epitopes to which antibodies are available, to allow for detection on western blots, immunoprecipitation, or activity depletion/blocking in bioassays.<br>
In another embodiment,  the sRa:pl heterodimer is prepared using the Fc-domain of human<br>
IgGl (Aruffo et al. (1991) Cell 67:35-44).   In contrast to the latter, formation of heterodimers must be biochemically achieved, as chimeric molecules carrying the Fc-domain will be expressed as disulfide-linked homodimers.  Thus, homodimers may be reduced under conditions that favor the disruption of inter-chain disulfides but do not effect intra-chain disulfides. Then monomers with different extracellular portions are mixed in equimolar amounts and oxidized to form a mixture of homo- and heterodimers.   The components of this mixture are separated by chromatographic techniques.  Alternatively, the formation of this type of heterodimers may be biased by genetically engineering and expressing molecules that consist of the soluble or extracellular portion of the<br><br>
receptor components followed by the Fc-domain of hlgG, followed by either the c-jun or the c-fos leucine zippers described above (Kostelny et al. (1992) J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553).  Since these leucine zippers form predominately heterodimers, they may be used to drive formation of the heterodimers where desired. As for the chimeric proteins described using leucine zippers, these may also be tagged with metal chelates or an epitope. This tagged domain can be used for rapid purification by metal-chelate chromatography, and/or by antibodies, to allow for detection on western blots, immunoprecipitation, or activity depletion/blocking in bioassays.<br>
In additional embodiments, heterodimers may be prepared using other immunoglobulin derived domains that drive the formation of dimers.  Such domains include, for example, the heavy chains of IgG (Cgl and Cg4), as well as the constant regions of kappa (k) and lambda (1) light chains of human inununoglobulins.  The heterodimerization of Cg with the light chain occurs between the CHI domain of Cg and the constant region of the light chain (CL), and is stabilized by covalent linking of the two domains via a single disulfide bridge. Accordingly, constructs may be prepared using these immunoglobulin domains. Alternatively, the immunoglobulin domains include domains that may be derived from T cell receptor components which drive dimerization.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the sRa:bl heterodimers are prepared by expression as chimeric molecules utilizing flexible linker loops.  A DNA construct encoding the chimeric protein is designed such that it expresses two soluble or extracellular domains fused together in tandem ("head to head") by a flexible loop.  This loop may be entirely artificial (e.g. polyglycine repeats interrupted by serine or threonine at a certain interval) or "borrowed" from naturally occurring proteins (e.g. the hinge region of hlgG).  Molecules may be engineered in which the order of the soluble or extracellular domains fused is switched (e.g. sIL6Ra/loop/sgpl30 or sgpl30/loop/sIL-6Ra) and/or in which the length and composition of the loop is varied, to allow for selection of molecules with desired characteristics.<br>
Alternatively, the heterodimers made according to the present invention may be purified from cell lines cotransfected with the appropriate a and P components.  Heterodimers may be separated from homodimers using methods available to those skilled in the art.  For example, limited quantities of heterodimers may be recovered by passive elution from preparative, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels.  Alternatively, heterodimers may be purified using high pressure cation exchange chromatography.  Excellent purification has been obtained using a Mono S cation exchange column.<br>
Effective doses useful for treating IL-1 related diseases or disorders may be determined using methods known to one skilled in the art (see, for example, Fingl, et al. (1975) The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Goodman and Gilman, eds. Macmillan Publishing Co., New York, pp. 1-46). Pharmaceutical compositions for use according to the invention include the antagonists described above in a pharmacologically acceptable liquid, solid or semi-solid carrier, linked to a carrier or targeting molecule (e.g., antibody, hormone, growth factor, etc.) and/or incorporated into liposomes, microcapsules, and controlled release preparation (including antagonist expressing cells) prior to administration in vivo.  For example, the pharmaceutical composition may comprise one or more of the antagonists in an aqueous solution, such as sterile water, saline, phosphate buffer or dextrose<br><br>
solution.  Alternatively, the active agents may be comprised in a solid (e.g. wax) or semi-solid (e.g. gelatinous) formulation that may be implanted into a patient in need of such treatment.   The administration route may be any mode of administration known in the art, including but not limited to intravenously, intrathecally, subcutaneousiy, by injection into involved tissue, intraarterially, intranasally, orally, or via an implanted device.<br>
Administration may result in the distribution of the active agent of the invention throughout the body or in a localized area.  For example, in some conditions which involve distant regions of the nervous system, intravenous or intrathecal administration of agent may be desirable.  In some situations, an implant containing active agent may be placed in or near the lesioned area.   Suitable implants include, but are not limited to, gelfoam, wax, or microparticle-based implants.<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1.   Cloning of Fusion Polypeptide Components<br>
The extracellular domains of the human cytokine receptors were obtained by standard PCR techniques using tissue cDNAs (CLONTECH), cloned into the expression vector, pMT21 (Genetics Institute, Inc.), and the sequences were sequenced by standard techniques using an ABI 373A DNA sequencer and Taq Dideoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA).  For the IL-lRAcP, nucleotides 1 through 1074 (corresponding to the amino acids 1-358) from the Genbank sequence, AB006357, were cloned.  For the IL-1RI, nucleotides 55 through 999 (corresponding to the amino acids 19-333) from the Genbank sequence, X16896, were cloned.<br>
Example 2.     Production of Fusion Polypeptides (Cytokine Traps)<br>
The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytokine Traps were constructed from the individual cloned DNAs (described supra ) by standard cloning and PCR techniques. In each case, the sequences were constructed in frame such that the sequence encoding the first fusion polypeptide component was fused to the sequence encoding the second fusion polypeptide component followed by an Fc domain (hinge, CH2 and CH3 region of human IgGl) as the multimerizing component.  In some cases extra nucleotides were inserted in frame between sequences encoding the first and second fusion polypeptide components to add a linker region between the two components<br>
Example 3. MRC5 Bioassay for IL-1 Traps<br>
MRC5 human lung fibroblast cells respond to IL-1 by secreting IL-6 and thus were utilized to assay the ability of IL-1 Traps to block the IL-1-dependent production of IL-6.   IL1 Trap 1SC569 was tested against IL-1-RLFc which is the extracellular domain of the IL-1 Type I receptor fused to an Fc domain.<br>
MRC5 cells are suspended at 1 x 105 cells per ml in medium and 0.1 ml of cells are plated (10,000 cells per well) into the wells of a 96 well tissue culture plate. Plates are incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in .a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.<br>
IL-1 Trap and recombinant human IL-1 at varying doses are pre-incubated in a 96 well tissue<br><br>
culture dish and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. 0.1 ml of this mixture is then added to the 96 well plate containing the MRC5 cells such that the final concentration of IL-1 Trap is lOnM and the final concentrations of the IL-1 ranges from 2.4 pM to 5nM.   Control wells contain Trap alone or nothing.<br>
Plates are then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Supernatant is collected and assayed for levels of IL-6 using R&amp;D Systems Quantikine Imniunoassay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Example 4.  Blocking of Injected IL-1 by IL-1 Trap In Vivo<br>
IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine.   Systemic administration of IL-1 has been shown to elicit acute responses in animals, including transient hyperglycemia, hypoinsulinemia, fever, anorexia, and increased serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Reimers, 1998).  Since mice are responsive to both murine and human IL-1, human IL-1 can be used and in vivo binding effects of human specific IL-1 antagonists can be evaluated. This acute mouse model was used to determine the ability of a human IL-1 Trap to antagonize the in vivo effects of exogenously administered human IL-1. This provides a rapid indication of in vivo efficacy of the human. IL-1 Trap and can be used as an assay to help molecule selection.<br>
Experimental Design: Male C57BL/6 mice were given a subcutaneous injection of<br>
recombinant human IL-lp (rhIL-lβ; 0.3mg/kg).  Twenty four hours prior to rhIL-1β administration, animals were treated with either vehicle, human IL-1 Trap 569 (50 or 150-fold molar excess; 0.18 or 0.54mg/kg, respectively), or recombinant murine IL-1 receptor antagonist (rmlL-lra; 150 or 750-fold molar excess; 45.8 or 229μg/kg, respectively).  Blood samples were taken 2h after administration of rhIL-1β and the sera were assayed for IL-6 levels using a mouse IL-6 ELISA. Exogenous administration of rhIL-lβ significantly increased serum IL-6 levels.   Pretreatment with either a 50 or 150-fold molar excess of hIL-1 Trap blocked the rhIL-lβ-induction of IL-6.  In contrast, injection of rmlL-lra at either  a 150 or 750-fold molar excess did not block IL-6 induction.<br>
Results.  Exogenous administration of human IL-1 resulted a dramatic induction of serum IL-6 levels.  At 150-fold molar excess, the human IL-1 Trap completely blocked the IL-6 increase (Fig. 1).   Furthermore, the effects of the human IL-1 Trap persisted for at least another 24 hours, preventing an IL-6 increase even when IL-1 was re-administered (Fig. 1).  Such long-lasting efficacy suggests that daily injection of an IL-1 Trap may not be necessary for chronic applications.<br>
In a separate experiment, IL-lra at 150-fold or 750-fold molar excess did not significantly block IL6 induction. Therefore, in this paradigm. IL-1 Trap appears to be a better blocker of IL-1 activity (Fig. 2).<br>

2027 from A to C to change the amino acid from Lys to Thr.   SG insertion:  Between nucleotides<br>

Example 6.   Human IL-1 Trap Blocks the Effedts of IL-1 in Inflammed Joints<br>
Background:  Zymosan is a yeast cell wall extract that when injected into the knee causes<br>
acute inflammation and upregulation of IL-1 p in the joint (Joosten et al. (1994) Clin Exp Immunol 97:204-211.).  Chondrocytes will respond to the inflammation and local IL-lβ by down regulating<br><br>
proteoglycan synthesis, a feature of human arthritis that contributes to the gradual destruction of cartilage in the joint (van den Berg et al. (1982) Rheum Intl 1:165-169).  Antagonists to IL-ip can be used to evaluate their ability to block the effects of zymosan-induced elevations in IL-1 p.<br>
Materials and Methods:  Anesthetized male C57BL/6 mice (Taconic) were given an intra-articular (i.a.) injection of Zymosan A (Sigma; 300(ig in 10μl) into the right knee joint through the patellar ligament.  Sterile PBS was injected i.a. (lOjil) into the left knee joint through the patellar ligament.  Twenty four hours prior to i.a. injections, animals were treated with either vehicle or hlL-1 Trap 569 (19mg/kg, s.c).  The patellae were removed 24h after injection of .zymosan in order to measure proteoglycan synthesis as described by van den Berg et al. (1982) supra. Briefly, each patella and associated ligament were incubated for 3h at 37°C, 5% CO2 in media (RPMI with HEPES, HCO3, glutamine &amp; penicillin/streptomycin) containing 10^iCi/ml 35S-sulfate (NEN DuPont). Following incubation, tissue was washed and fixed overnight in 10% formalin (VWR).  The tissue was ' then placed in Decalcifing Solution (J.T. Baker) for 4h prior to dissection of the patella from surrounding tissue.  Each patella was then incubated overnight in Solvable (Packard) at 50°C. Ultima Gold liquid scintillation fluid (Packard) was added and the samples were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Values were reported as the ratio of cpm of zymosan patella/cpm of vehicle patella for each animal.<br>
Results:   Intra-articular injection of zymosan reduces proteoglycan synthesis by<br>
approximately 50% relative to vehicle injection (Fig. 3).   Administration of hIL-1 Trap prior to zymosan injection blocked the local action of IL-ip and proteoglycan synthesis returned to approximately 90% of control.   These data demonstrate that hIL-1 Trap 569 can penetrate the joints after subcutaneous injection to effectively neutralize the biological effect of IL-1 within these joints.<br>
Example 7.   Murine IL-1 Trap Reduces the Severity of Arthritis Symptoms in a Zymosan-Accelerated Collage-Induced Arthritis (CIA) Model<br>
Background.   IL-1 has been implicated in the development of inflammation and cartilage<br>
destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (Dinarello (1996) Blood 87(6):2095-2147; Wooley et al. (1993) Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism 36(9):1305-1314).  Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely studied animal model of inflammatory polyarthritis with similarities to rheumatoid arthritis; common histopathological features include joint inflammation and erosion, synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration (Joe et al. (1999) Mol Med Today 5:367-369).   Since previous studies have shown that various anti-IL-1 treatments have a positive effect on reducing arthritis symptoms in CIA animals (van den Berg et al. (1994) Clin Exp Immunol 95:237-243; Joosten et al. (1999) J Immunol 163:5049-5055.; van de Loo et al. (1992) J Rheumatol 19:348-356.), Applicants examined the effect of a murine version of the IL-1 Trap (mIL-1 Trap) on the progression of arthritis symptoms in this animal model.   The human version of the EL-1 Trap is poorly cross-reactive with rodent IL-1.  The mIL-1 Trap consists of the extracellular domain of murine IL-lRAcP, followed by the extracellular domain of murine IL-1RI, followed by the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domain of murine<br><br>
IgG2a.<br>
' Materials and Methods.  Male DBA-1 mice (Jackson Laboratories) were immunized<br>
intfadennally at the base of the tail with 100μg/50μl bovine Type II collagen (CII; Chondrex) emulsified with complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (2:1:1 ratio; Chondrex) and boosted intradermally with CII (100μg/50μ,1) emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant on day 21. Since CIA in DBA-1 mice occurs gradually over a long time period with a low incidence (Joosten et al. (1994) Clin Exp Immunol 97:204-211.), Applicants synchronized the onset of arthritis symptoms by injecting the animals intraperitoneally on day 30 with 3mg zymosan (Sigma).  Two hours prior to zymosan injection, the mice were randomly distributed into treatment groups and were injected with either vehicle or mIL-1 Trap (31 or 10 mg/kg, 3X/week, 8 injections, s.c).  Arthritis symptoms (ASI scores, as described by Wooley et al. (1993) Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism 36(9):1305-1314) in the paws were evaluated 3X/week by individuals who were blinded to the treatment groups. Animals were sacrificed 24h after the 8th injection at which time paw width along with ASI scores were measured. Results.  Within 5 days after i.p injection of zymosan, vehicle treated animals had an<br>
significant increase in ASI score relative to those receiving mIL-1 Trap (Fig. 4) with symptoms reaching a maximum 10 to 14 days after zymosan injection.  Murine EL-1 Trap acted in a dose-dependent fashion such that animals receiving l0mg/kg Trap had more arthritis symptoms (greater ASI score) than those receiving 31 mg/kg.   However, both mIL-1 Trap-treated groups had a significantly lower degree of arthritis symptoms than vehicle. This difference in ASI score is also reflected in the paw width at the time of sacrifice (Fig.  5).  Animals receiving mIL-1 Trap had paw widths that were similar to those of naive, non-collagen immunized animals.  These data indicate that mIL-1 Trap can effectively neutralize IL-1 and block the development of arthritic joints.<br>
Example 8.   IL-1 Trap 1649 Can Block the Activity of IL-lβ<br>
Various concentrations of IL-1 Trap 1649 were incubated in the presence of 5 pM human IL-lb overnight at room temperature.  The mixtures were then added to duplicate wells of 293-NFkB cells (20,000 cells/well) for 5 hrs at 37°C, 5% CO2,.  293-NFkB cells contain a stably integrated reporter plasmid possessing a luciferase gene driven by a promoter containing 5 NFkB sites. Addition of IL-lb results in increased luciferase gene expression. Steady-Glo Reagent (Promega) was added to the cells for 15 min at room temperature and luciferase gene expression was quantitated as relative light units (RLU) by luminometry.  IL-1 Trap 1649 displays an IC50 of 32 pM which indicates a Kd of ~30 pM (Fig. 6),   These data indicate that IL-1 Trap 1649 potently blocks IL-1.<br>
