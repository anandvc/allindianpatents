ANJARA RAGHAVBHAI DEVSHI<br>
an Indian National<br>

Jacob Circle, Saatrasta, Mahalaxmi (E), Mumbai 400 011,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPEC IFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to wheels for vehicles.<br>
Background of invention:<br>
The basic principle behind this invention was arrived at by observing a man walking in a cylindrical cement pipe and further observing that the pipe started rolling. Thus by exerting radial force on the pipe, the pipe started rolling forward. The man was the driver and the pipe was the driven component. It saved the energy of the man and increased efficiency.<br>
Popular Science (USA magazine) sometime in 1932 published information of, Dr J.H Purves' "Dynasphere" which was made to roll across the sands of southern England at a reported 30mph, and was designed to replace an automobile .The driver was put inside the wheel and thereby locomotion was reduced to a simple form, with consequent economy of power .A 2.5 hp motor propelled the 1000 pound wheel which drivers steered by leaning. However due to the unfortunate phenomenon of "gerbiling" in which riders spun inside the wheel during acceleration or braking, the idea did not work. Nonetheless, the massive monowheel concept has been the inspiration for the present invention.<br>
In the prior art it is known that wheels are driven by pedals or by an engine.<br>
Typically, the back wheels are driven whereas the front wheels are steered.<br>
In some vehicles notably four wheels drives both front and rear wheels are driven.<br>
2<br><br>
Again in the prior art, all the wheels support the load of the vehicle and the passengers and or cargo on the vehicle via the chassis.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
One object of this invention is to provide a driving means which increases the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.<br>
One more object of this invention is to provide a driving means which increase generated power.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a power saving driving means which is economical and easy to manufacture.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide driving means which can be used for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four wheelers and even bicycles.<br>
Summary:<br>
This invention envisages a novel wheel set for vehicles which consists of an auxiliary wheel cooperating with the main wheel.<br>
The principle in accordance with which this invention has been conceived is that a wheel can be driven by applying angular driving force on the inner circumference of the ring. This ring should be fixed inside or alongside of the rear wheel. In the prior art this mechanism has been attempted in the case of devices such as the monocycle. However, the stability issues have not allowed the monocycle to go beyond the stage of experimentation.<br>
3<br><br>
This invention envisages a collar secured to the existing driven wheels within which a second wheel is provided. The vehicle load is divided between the main wheel and the auxiliary wheel. In the case of two-wheeled vehicle the driven wheel is the rear wheel and the auxiliary wheel is fitted to the rear wheel. Again in the case of an automobile or a rickshaw the driven wheels may be the rear wheels and each of the rear wheels are fitted with the auxiliary wheel in accordance with this invention. A typical load distribution pattern may be such that the vehicle frame load is transferred to the main driven wheel and the passenger and cargo load is transferred to the auxiliary wheel by a support frame assembly.<br>
Power is transferred to the main driven wheel conventionally either by the pedals or by the engine or by the electric motor. In the new invention, the auxiliary wheel/s is/are driven by the same engine or an auxiliary engine. This both wheels can be driven by same electric motor or by an auxiliary electric motor. This both wheels also can be driven by engine plus electric motor simultaneously in the case of hybrid vehicle. This power produced .by the engine is distributed in two parts to the main wheel and the auxiliary wheel preferably simultaneously.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the auxiliary wheel may be driven by solar energy or electric power. Thus the wheel set in accordance with this invention is very suitable for hybrid vehicles.<br>
In use therefore, the auxiliary wheel and the main wheel act together to<br>
move the vehicle. Typically the revolution of the auxiliary wheel in the<br>
.collar will empower the main driven wheel and reduce the load on the main<br>
4<br><br>
Wheel which will result in fuel saving and therefore increase the life and the performance of the main wheel. The auxiliary wheel can typically have a solid resilient tire and the collar is of metal, which has a smoothened channel to receive the auxiliary wheel. It is also envisaged that in use the wheel set of a main wheel with an auxiliary wheel secured thereto both wheel being driven wheels will be able to generate increased power at reduced fuel and power consumption.<br>
Brief description of drawing:<br>
The wheel for vehicles in accordance with this invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the figure 1 represents the "wheel-in-wheel" arrangement in accordance with this invention.<br>
Detailed description of drawing:<br>
Figure 1 show a sectional schematic view of the arrangement in accordance with this invention in which the auxiliary wheel is indicated by the reference numeral (12) which revolves within the collar (14) fitted alongside the main wheel (10). The collar (14) has a recess (16) to accommodate the auxiliary wheel (12). The collar 14 is bolted to the wheel disc (18) of the main wheel (10). Power is transmitted to both wheels (10) and (12) via power take off shafts from the same engine [not particularly shown] or different engines or even pedals in the case of a bicycle.<br>
5<br><br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the arrangement can also be used as an auxiliary braking system. Particularly, when the auxiliary wheel is connected to an independent driving source. By reducing the power from the source or by shutting off the power, the auxiliary wheel would stop .driving. The load exerted by the auxiliary wheel could bear on the collar causing the braking action. If the auxiliary wheel is made reversible, it is also possible that the auxiliary wheel will exert a positive braking force on the main wheel. Thus the arrangement could be used as an auxiliary braking system and reduce the wear and tear of the main braking system used hitherto conventionally.<br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the specific elements of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many -alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
