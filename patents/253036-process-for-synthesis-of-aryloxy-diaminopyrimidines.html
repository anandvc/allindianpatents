This invention pertains to a process for the preparation of compounds which are e.g. useful for treatment of diseases associated with P2X purinergic receptors, and more particularly to a process for the preparation of P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 antagonists for treatment of genitourinary, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and pain-related diseases, conditions and disorders.<br>
The urinary bladder is responsible for two important physiological functions: urine storage and urine emptying. This process involves two main steps: (1) the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level; and (2) a nervous reflex, called the micturition reflex, occurs that empties the bladder or, if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or mediated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain.<br>
Purines, acting via extracellular purinoreceptors, have been implicated as having a variety of physiological and pathological roles. (See, Burnstock (1993) Drug Dev. Res. 28:195-206.) ATP, and to a lesser extent, adenosine, can stimulate sensory nerve endings resulting in intense pain and a pronounced increase in sensory nerve discharge. ATP receptors have been classified into two major families, the P2Y- and P2X-purinoreceptors, on the basis of molecular structure, transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological characterization. The P2Y-purinoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors, while the P2X-purinoreceptors are a family of ATP-gated cation channels. Purinergic receptors, in particular, P2X receptors, are known to form homomultimers or heteromultimers. To date, cDNAs for several P2X receptors subtypes have been cloned, including: six homomeric receptors, P2Xi; P2X2; P2X3; P2X4; P2X5; and P2X7; and three heteromeric receptors P2X2/3, P2X4/6, P2Xj/5 (See, e.g., Chen et al. (1995) Nature 377:428-431; Lewis et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435; and Burnstock (1997) Neurophamacol. 36:1127-1139). The structure and chromosomal mapping of mouse genomic P2X? receptor subunit has also been described (Souslova et al. (1997) Gene 195:101-111). In vitro, co-expression of P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits is necessary to produce ATP-gated currents with the properties seen in some sensory neurons (Lewis et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435).<br>
P2X receptor subunits are found on afferents in rodent and human bladder urothelium. Data exists suggesting that ATP may be released from epithelial/endothelial cells of the<br><br>
urinary bladder or other hollow organs as a result of distention (Bumstock (1999) J. Anatomy 194:335-342; and Ferguson et ah (1997) J. Physiol. 505:503-511), ATP released in this manner may serve a role in conveying information to sensory neurons located in subepithelial components, e.g., suburothelial lamina propria (Namasivayam, et al. (1999) BJU Intl. 84:854-860). The P2X receptors have been studied in a number of neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, mesenteric, and central neurons (Zhong et al. (1998) Br. J. Pharmacol. 125:771-781). These studies indicate that purinergic receptors play a role in afferent neurotransmission from the bladder, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful in the treatment of bladder disorders and other genitourinary diseases or conditions.<br>
Recent evidence also suggests a role of endogenous ATP and purinergic receptors in nociceptive responses in mice (Tsuda et al. (1999) Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:1497-1504). ATP-induced activation of P2X receptors on dorsal root ganglion nerve terminals in the spinal cord has been shown to stimulate release of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in nociceptive signaling (Gu and MacDermott, Nature 389:749-753 (1997)). P2X3 receptors have been identified on nociceptive neurons in the tooth pulp (Cook et al., Nature 387:505-508 (1997)). ATP released from damaged cells may thus lead to pain by activating P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 containing receptors on nociceptive sensory nerve endings. This is consistent with the induction of pain by intradermally applied ATP in the human blister-base model (Bleehen, Br J Pharmacol 62:573-577 (1978)). P2X antagonists have been shown to be analgesic in animal models (Driessen and Starke* Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 350:618-625 (1994)). This evidence suggests that P2X2 and P2X3 are involved in nociception, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful as analgesics.<br>
Other researchers have shown that P2X3 receptors are expressed in human colon, and are expressed at higher levels in inflamed colon than in normal colon (Yiangou et al, Neuro-gastroenterol Mot (2001) 13:365-69). Other researchers have implicated the P2X3 receptor in detection of distension or intraluminal pressure in the intestine, and initiation of reflex contractions (Bian et al, J Physiol (2003) 551.1:309-22), and have linked this to colitis (Wynn et al., Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol (2004) 287:G647-57); Inge Brouns et al. (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol (2000) 23:52-61) found that P2X3 receptors are expressed in pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), implicating the receptor in pain<br><br>
transmission in the lung. More recently, others have implicated P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in p02 detection in pulmonary NEBs (Rong et al, J Neurosci (2003) 23(36);11315-21).<br>
There is accordingly a need for methods of making compounds that are effective modulators of P2X receptors, including the P2X3 and P2X2/3 Teceptors.<br><br>

Example 3:P2X3/P2X2/3 FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) Assay<br>
CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cloned rat P2X3 or human P2X2/3 receptor subunits and passaged in flasks. 18-24 hours before the FLIPR experiment, cells were released from their flasks, centrifuged, and resuspended in nutrient medium at 2.5 x 105 cells/ml. The cells were aliquoted into black-walled 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in 5% C02 at 37°C On the day of the experiment, cells were washed in FLIPR buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCh, 2.5 mM probenecid; FB). Each well received 100 nl FB and 100 |nl of the fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM [2 \xM final cone,]. After a 1 hour dye loading incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed 4 times with FB, and a final 75 ^il/well FB was left in each well.<br>
Test compounds (dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and serially diluted with FB) or vehicle were added to each well (25 \i\ of a 4X solution) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes at room temperature. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR and a baseline fluorescence measurement (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510-570 nm) was obtained for 10 seconds before a 100 jxl/well agonist or vehicle addition. The agonist was a 2X solution of a,p-meATP producing a final concentration of 1 \iM (P2X3) or 5 \xM (P2X2/3). Fluorescence was measured for an additional 2 minutes at 1 second intervals after agonist addition. A final addition of ionomycin (5 \iM, final concentration) was made to each well of the FLIPR test plate to establish cell viability and maximum fluorescence of dye-bound cytosolic calcium. Peak fluorescence in response to the addition of a,|3-meATP (in the absence and presence of test compounds) was measured and inhibition curves generated using nonlinear regression, PPADS, a standard P2X antagonist, was used as a positive control.<br>
Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention exhibited activity for the P2X3 receptor. Using the above assay, the compound 5-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phen-oxy)-pyrimidine-2?4-diamine exhibited a pICso of approximately 8,0 for the P2X3 receptor.<br>
