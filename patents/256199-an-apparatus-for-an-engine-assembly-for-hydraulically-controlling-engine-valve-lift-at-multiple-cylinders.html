SINGLE HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT MODULE FOR DUAL LIFT<br>
OF MULTIPLE ENGINE VALVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a single hydraulic circuit module<br>
attachable to a cylinder head of an engine for hydraulically controlling engine valve<br>
lift at multiple cylinders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Engine valve actuator assemblies for engines such as an internal<br>
combustion engine on a motor vehicle typically have a roller finger follower that<br>
contacts an engine valve and is pivotable in response to cam motion to lift the valve.<br>
A typical roller finger follower can be replaced by a hydraulically controlled<br>
switchable roller finger follower ("SRFF"). A hydraulically controlled SRFF, which<br>
is also referred to herein as a hydraulic lift assembly, can provide two distinct engine<br>
valve lifts. Hydraulic control of the SRFF may be designed to achieve a low lift and a<br>
high lift of the engine valve or may be designed such that a low lift is zero lift, or<br>
results in valve deactivation. An alternative hydraulic lift assembly can include<br>
hydraulically controlled switchable hydraulic lifter valves that provide two levels of<br>
engine valve lift through a push rod, as is known by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0003] . Traditionally, such variations in engine valve lift have been achieved<br>
by using a cylinder head that has a complex system of fluid supply passages that<br>
enable pressurized fluid to communicate with the hydraulic lift assemblies, which are<br>
supported in the cylinder head. Cylinder heads with such an integrated hydraulic<br>
system are necessarily specific to each engine family and entail numerous production<br>
steps such as casting, boring, and finishing the network of channels provided in the<br>
cylinder head.<br>
[0004]	U.S. Patent Number 6,584,951 issued July 1, 2003 to Patel, et. al and<br>
commonly assigned to General Motors Corporation, discloses an engine assembly that<br>
requires a separate individual hydraulic circuit module for each engine cylinder which<br>
achieves selective deactivation of each cylinder in accordance with the hydraulic<br>
controls provided within the cylinder module associated with the cylinder. The<br>
cylinder modules of the '951 patent utilize a solenoid valve to selectively block oil<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
2<br>
flow from a flow channel to an exit port of the module and thereby build oil pressure<br>
in the flow channel and in lifter openings of each collapsible hydraulic lifter valve<br>
associated with each cylinder. The oil pressure actuates the collapsible lifters to<br>
enable cylinder deactivation. The solenoid valve can also be controlled to permit the<br>
flow, thus causing the hydraulic lift assembly to cause reciprocal lifting and lowering<br>
(i.e., opening and closing) of the engine valve (i.e., actuating the cylinder). Thus,<br>
each solenoid valve acts as a two-way on/off valve.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	It is desirable to reduce hydraulic control system complexity and allow<br>
packaging flexibility while providing dual valve lift and/or engine valve deactivation<br>
capability for a specific engine. An apparatus is provided which functions as a single<br>
hydraulic circuit module that permits valve lift control of multiple engine valves in<br>
response to hydraulic controls within the hydraulic circuit module. The single<br>
hydraulic circuit module may be applied to an overhead cam-type engine or a<br>
pushrod-type valve gear train. The single hydraulic circuit module controls valve lift<br>
of multiple cylinders, and preferably of multiple sets of cylinders, thereby reducing<br>
the number of components required to enable variable valve lift and minimizing<br>
packaging concerns in comparison with systems requiring a separate hydraulic circuit<br>
module and/or separate hydraulic circuit integrated within the cylinder head for each<br>
individual cylinder.<br>
[0006]	Specifically, the single hydraulic circuit module is for an engine<br>
assembly having a cylinder head that at least partially forms a plurality of cylinders<br>
and supports at least one hydraulic lift assembly for each of the cylinders. The<br>
cylinder head is in fluid communication with a hydraulic fluid supply such as the<br>
supply gallery of an engine block attached below the cylinder head. The single<br>
hydraulic circuit module includes a solenoid valve and a housing that supports the<br>
solenoid valve. The housing at least partially forms a fluid supply passage and a<br>
control passage. The solenoid valve is positioned between the passages and is<br>
controllable to vary the volume (and therefore the pressure) of fluid flow from the<br>
fluid supply passage to the control passage. The housing is configured for attachment<br>
to the cylinder head so that the fluid supply passage is in fluid communication with<br>
the fluid supply gallery and the control passage is in fluid communication with<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
3<br>
hydraulic lift assemblies for a first set of the cylinders. Control of the solenoid valve<br>
thereby allows the hydraulic lift assemblies for the first set of cylinders to be<br>
controlled to a low lift or a high lift position, corresponding with the volume of fluid<br>
flow permitted by the solenoid valve. The low lift position may be a zero-lift position<br>
resulting in cylinder deactivation.<br>
[0007]	Preferably, the apparatus includes a second solenoid valve supported<br>
by the housing, in which case the housing at least partially forms a second control<br>
passage and the second solenoid valve is positioned between a supply passage and the<br>
second control passage. The second solenoid valve is controllable to vary fluid flow<br>
and pressure from the fluid supply passage to the second control passage. The second<br>
control passage is in fluid communication with hydraulic lift assemblies of the second<br>
set of cylinders when the housing is attached to the cylinder head. Thus, different sets<br>
of cylinders may be controlled to achieve variable lifts independently from one<br>
another. The ability to control different sets of engine valves independently solves<br>
issues caused by engine timing. The engine valves are timed such that the various<br>
cylinders are at different points in the combustion cycle. It is not advantageous to<br>
switch from a higher valve lift to a lower valve lift, or from a lower valve lift to a<br>
higher valve lift, during certain points of the combustion cycle. For instance, the<br>
switch may more highly stress the engine valve train components or cause<br>
unacceptable audible noise during some points of the cycle. The single hydraulic<br>
circuit module can control engine valve lift through hydraulic control of sets of<br>
hydraulic lift assemblies at different sets of the cylinders independently of one<br>
another, thus allowing the switch in valve lift to be accomplished at an optimal point<br>
in the combustion cycle for each cylinder set.<br>
[0008]	In one aspect of the invention, the housing of the single hydraulic<br>
circuit module forms separate chambers each configured to receive one of the<br>
solenoid valves. The supply passage and the control passages may each include a<br>
channel formed on an outer surface of the housing and an aperture extending through<br>
the channel that is in fluid communication with a fluid supply (in the case of the<br>
supply passage) and the chamber (in the case of each respective control passage).<br>
[0009]	Various features may be provided within the apparatus including a<br>
filter positioned in the supply passage upstream of the solenoid valve to filter debris<br>
that may otherwise affect valve performance. Additionally, a gasket may be provided<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
4<br>
that circumscribes the fluid supply channel and the control passage(s) for sealing the<br>
apparatus when it is attached to the cylinder head. Furthermore, a weep channel may<br>
be formed on the surface of the housing to circumscribe the fluid supply passage and<br>
the control passage(s). The weep channel is circumscribed by the gasket. Thus, any<br>
tluid seeping out of the fluid communication between the module and the cylinder<br>
head will be collected in the weep channel. Preferably, a drain passage is provided in<br>
the cylinder head opposite the weep channel to allow drain back to the fluid supply.<br>
[0010]	The single hydraulic circuit module can provide hydraulic control for<br>
dual valve lift of intake valves and/or exhaust valves associated with the respective<br>
cylinders. Separate feed passages are provided in the cylinder head that are in fluid<br>
communication with the first and second control passages when the module is<br>
attached to the cylinder head. The first feed passage provides control fluid to<br>
hydraulic lift assemblies at the first set of cylinders and the second feed passage<br>
provides control fluid to hydraulic lift assemblies at the second set of cylinders. The<br>
first and second sets of cylinders may be associated with a single overhead camshaft.<br>
For instance, the first set and the second set may all be intake valves operatively<br>
connected with an intake camshaft or may all be exhaust valves operatively connected<br>
with an exhaust camshaft. Alternatively, the first and second sets of cylinders may be<br>
associated with two overhead camshafts, such as an intake camshaft and an exhaust<br>
camshaft. In this instance, the single hydraulic circuit module may control hydraulic<br>
lift at intake and exhaust valves of the first set of cylinders, or at intake and exhaust<br>
valves at the second set of cylinders.<br>
[0011]	Flexible packaging is possible due to the minimal packaging space<br>
required by a single hydraulic circuit module. For instance, the single hydraulic<br>
circuit module may be attached to the cylinder head between adjacent ones of the<br>
cylinders, such as between adjacent spark plug towers and the intake and exhaust<br>
camshafts. For other engine families, the module may be mounted on the rear of the<br>
cylinder head, i.e., on the rear side thereof.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

a side surface of a cylinder head.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to Figure 1, a single hydraulic circuit module 10 is attached<br>
to a cylinder head 12 of a cylinder head assembly 14 which represents a portion of<br>
an engine assembly 16. The single hydraulic circuit module 10 is attached with<br>
three bolts 18 received through three respective fastener openings 20 (two shown in<br>
Figure 2) and through corresponding mating engine openings 22 to secure the<br>
module 10 to an outer surface 23 of the cylinder head 12.<br>
[0020J	The engine assembly 16 is an overhead cam-type with a separate inlet<br>
camshaft and exhaust camshaft (not shown in Figure 1 but inlet camshaft shown in<br>
Figure 3) for lifting and lowering of inlet valves and exhaust valves, respectively.<br>
The inlet camshaft rotates about inlet camshaft axis 24 and the exhaust camshaft<br>
rotates about exhaust camshaft axis 26. The single hydraulic circuit module 10 is<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
6<br>
configured to control inlet valves at multiple cylinders. As will be explained herein,<br>
module 10 controls a first set of inlet valves separately from a second set of inlet<br>
valves. Although in the embodiment shown, the module 10 controls inlet valves, it<br>
may alternatively control exhaust valves by providing a cylinder head with fastener<br>
openings 20 and mating engine openings 22 repositioned so that the module 10 is<br>
rotated 180 degrees with respect to its position in Figure 1 and can operatively<br>
connect to exhaust valves aligned with the exhaust camshaft axis 26.<br>
[0021]	Referring to Figure 3, control of an engine valve to provide dual lift<br>
will be briefly described. Figure 3 illustrates a hydraulic lift assembly 30, also<br>
referred to as an SRFF assembly supported by the cylinder head 12. The SRFF<br>
assembly 30 is pivotally mounted on a hydraulic lash adjuster 32, and contacts the<br>
valve stem 34 of an engine inlet valve 36 that selectively opens and closes an inlet<br>
passage 38 to a cylinder 40 partially formed by the cylinder head 12. The engine<br>
inlet valve 36 is selectively lifted and lowered in response to rotation of an inlet<br>
camshaft 42 on which multiple cam lobes are mounted. The inlet camshaft 42<br>
rotates about inlet camshaft axis 24.<br>
[0022]	The SRFF assembly 30 includes an inner rocker arm 44 which<br>
rotatably supports a roller element 46. The inner rocker arm 44 is positioned<br>
between outer rocker arms 48, one of which is visible. The other outer rocker arm<br>
48 is positioned on the opposite side of the inner rocker arm 44 and is configured<br>
exactly like the rocker arm 48 visible in Figure 3. A first low lift cam lobe 50<br>
rotates with the camshaft 42 and is in operative contact with the roller element 46<br>
mounted on the inner rocker arm 44. The inner rocker arm 44 is in contact with the<br>
valve stem 34. The inner and outer rocker arms 44, 48 are both pivotable about an<br>
axis through pivot point 53. The arms 44, 48 may selectively be pivotable relative<br>
to one another or connected together for common pivoting about pivot point 53.<br>
High lift is provided by selectively pinning the inner arm 44 and the outer arm 48<br>
together for common pivoting about pivot point 53. When the inner rocker arm 44<br>
pivots freely with respect to the outer rocker arm 48, action of the high lift cam lobe<br>
52 on the outer rocker arm 48 does not affect lift of the engine inlet valve 36.<br>
Instead, the high lift cam lobe 52 simply causes the outer rocker arm 48 to move<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
7<br>
relative to the inner rocker arm 44 about the pivot point 53 in "lost motion" without<br>
any impact on the lift event of the engine inlet valve 36. Rather, lift of the engine<br>
inlet valve 36 is affected only by action of the low lift cam lobe 50 on the roller<br>
element 46 as transferred to the engine inlet valve 36 via the inner rocker arm 44,<br>
which contacts the valve stem 34.<br>
[0023]	When high valve lift is desired, the outer rocker arm 48 may be<br>
connected for common pivoting with the inner rocker arm 44. When this occurs,<br>
the effect of the high lift cam lobe 52 on the outer rocker arm 48 is transferred to<br>
the inner rocker arm 44 and to the engine inlet valve 36. Switching between the low<br>
lift and high lift event is affected by controlling the hydraulic pressure fed through<br>
the hydraulic lash adjuster 32. The hydraulic lash adjuster 32 is in fluid<br>
communication with a pin 54 transversely mounted with respect to the arms 44 and<br>
46 at an axis through pivot point 53. During a low lift event, a relatively low<br>
pressure of hydraulic fluid is fed through feed passage 60 to a chamber 62 formed<br>
within the hydraulic lash adjuster 32. The feed passage 60 is formed or machined<br>
within cylinder head 12. The chamber 62 is in fluid communication with a channel<br>
64 which acts upon an inner transverse surface of the pin 54. The relatively low<br>
pressure is insufficient to actuate the pin 54 outward to be received within a pin bore<br>
56 formed in the outer rocker arm 48. When high valve lift is desired, an electronic<br>
control unit (not shown) controls the single hydraulic circuit module 10 of Figure 1<br>
and 2 to increase hydraulic fluid pressure provided in feed passage 60 thereby<br>
increasing pressure on the pin 54 sufficiently to actuate it outward to lock the inner<br>
rocker arm 44 to the outer rocker arm 48. A hydraulic lift assembly such as<br>
assembly 30 is discussed in further detail in United States Patent Number<br>
6,769,387, issued August 3, 2004 to Hayman et al., commonly assigned to General<br>
Motors Corporation, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0024]	Operation of the single hydraulic circuit module 10 to vary the<br>
hydraulic fluid pressure within the feed passage 60 is described below. It should be<br>
noted, that the lift control provided by the control module 10 as described with<br>
respect to the engine inlet valve 36 may also be applied to an exhaust valve such as<br>
the exhaust valve 66 shown in Figure 3. It should also be appreciated that the<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
8<br>
second embodiment of a single hydraulic circuit module shown and described with<br>
respect to Figures 4 through 6 herein also operates to control fluid pressure in a<br>
similar feed passage in fluid communication with engine valves as described with<br>
respect to the SRFF assembly 30, hydraulic lash adjuster 32 and engine inlet valve<br>
36 of Figure 3. Although a SRFF assembly 30 having inner and outer rocker arms<br>
44, 48 selectively connectable for common pivoting is described in Figure 3, other<br>
types of hydraulic lift assemblies which are hydraulically controlled to allow<br>
variable valve lift may also be employed within the scope of the invention. For<br>
instance, the single hydraulic circuit module described herein may also be utilized<br>
with respect to a push rod-type engine in which a pin within a hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster is selectively engaged to control valve lift. The dual valve lift, i.e., the<br>
low lift and the high lift events, may be such that the low lift event is zero lift,<br>
resulting in cylinder deactivation. For instance, a controllable hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster to provide cylinder deactivation is described with respect to a push rod-type<br>
engine in U.S. Patent Number 6,584,951, issued July 1, 2003 to Patel et. al and<br>
commonly assigned to General Motors Corporation, which is hereby incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0025]	Referring now to Figure 2, the single hydraulic circuit module 10<br>
will be described in greater detail. Module 10 includes a housing 68 which is<br>
preferably cast and includes a plurality of fluid passages described herein. The fluid<br>
passages are formed or machined in the housing 68. The housing 68 supports a first<br>
solenoid valve 70 as well as a second solenoid valve 72. The housing 68 is formed<br>
with a first chamber 74 in which a valve body 76 of the first solenoid valve 70 is<br>
selectively translatable in response to hydraulic fluid pressure within the chamber<br>
74. The housing 68 also forms a second chamber 78 which houses a second valve<br>
body 80 of the second solenoid valve 72. The second valve body 80 is translatable<br>
in response to hydraulic fluid pressure within the chamber 78.<br>
[0026]	The housing 68 is formed with flanges 82, two of which are visible in<br>
Figure 2 and all three of which are visible in Figure 1. The two flanges 82 visible<br>
in Figure 2 are formed with the fastener openings 20 that, when aligned with mating<br>
engine openings 22, will allow the single hydraulic circuit module 10 to be attached<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
9<br>
to the cylinder head 12. Two of the flanges 82 visible in Figure 2 also partially<br>
house a first control passage 84 and a second control passage 86. When the module<br>
10 is attached to the cylinder head 12, the first control passage 84 aligns with a first<br>
feed passage 60A formed in the cylinder head 12. The first feed passage 60A<br>
allows hydraulic fluid at a controlled pressure to be supplied to a first set of engine<br>
valves, as will be described herein. The second control passage 86 is in fluid<br>
communication with a second feed passage 60B also formed in the cylinder head 12<br>
which is in fluid communication with the second set of engine valves as will be<br>
described herein. An additional flange 82 (which does not house a fastener opening<br>
20), is also formed on the housing 68 and partially houses a supply passage 92<br>
which, when the module 10 is attached to the cylinder head 12, aligns with a fluid<br>
supply passage 94 formed in the cylinder head 12 which, in turn, is in fluid<br>
communication with a fluid supply gallery 96 formed in the engine, and shown in<br>
phantom in Figure 2. Those skilled in the art will readily understand the fluid<br>
supply gallery 96 formed in the engine to be a portion of the cast engine to which<br>
hydraulic fluid flows. Fluid may be supplied to the fluid supply passage 92 from<br>
the supply passage 94 and gallery 96 via a pump (not shown). A filter 93 is<br>
schematically shown positioned in the supply passage 92 to filter debris that might<br>
otherwise be carried from the supply gallery 96 downstream to the chambers 74 and<br>
78.<br>
[0027]	The fluid supply passage 92 has a worm-like configuration that is in<br>
fluid communication with a portion of the first chamber 74 beneath the valve body<br>
76. The first control passage 84 is also formed within the housing 68 and includes a<br>
transverse portion positioned opposite the first and second solenoid valves 70, 72<br>
with respect to the supply passage 92 and the second control passage 86. The<br>
transverse portion of the first control passage 84 is positioned to be in fluid<br>
communication with the chamber 74 opposite the supply passage 92. The valve<br>
body 76 is sized to selectively partially interfere with the first control passage 84.<br>
Specifically, when fluid is supplied through the supply passage 92 at a first,<br>
relatively low pressure, the valve body 76 is pushed upward to only partially<br>
obscure an opening 100 of the first control passage 84 at the chamber 74. Thus,<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
10<br>
fluid is able to flow to the first control passage 84 at a first flow volume. The fluid<br>
then flows to the first feed passage 60A in the cylinder head 12 to be directed to a<br>
first set of hydraulic lift assemblies as will be described below.<br>
[0028]	The supply passage 92 includes an intermediate portion 102 formed<br>
between the first chamber 74 and the second chamber 78 and in fluid<br>
communication therewith. Thus, fluid in the supply passage 92 is supplied to the<br>
second chamber 78 via the first chamber 74 and the intermediate portion of the<br>
supply passage 102. The fluid that collects in the second chamber 78 is of sufficient<br>
pressure to lift the second valve body 80 such that it only partially interferes with an<br>
opening 104 of second control passage at the chamber 78. Thus, a first fluid flow is<br>
provided through the second control passage 86 to the second feed passage 60B of<br>
the cylinder head 12 to be directed to a second set of hydraulic lift assemblies as<br>
will be described below.<br>
[0029]	The solenoids 70, 72 are preferably electronically controlled by an<br>
electronic control unit (not shown) to translate the valve bodies 76, 80 within the<br>
respective chambers 74, 78.<br>
[0030]	First supply passage opening 106, second supply passage opening 108<br>
and opening 115 of first control passage 84 are plugged after the supply passages<br>
92, 102 are drilled in the module 10. Exhaust passages (not shown) are also<br>
provided in fluid communication with each of the chambers 74, 78 to drain excess<br>
fluid back to the engine fluid supply.<br>
[0031]	When the solenoid valves 70, 72 are controlled to position the valve<br>
bodies 76, 80 such that the control passages 84, 86 are accessible to provide a first<br>
amount of fluid flow, the first and second sets of hydraulic lift assemblies<br>
respectively controlled via passages 84 and 86 and feed passages 60A and 60B lift<br>
engine valves a first predetermined amount, that is a relatively low lift level. When<br>
a higher level of valve lift is desired, the first and second solenoid valves 70, 72 are<br>
controlled by the electronic control unit (not shown) to lift respective valve bodies<br>
76, 80 to allow unobstructed flow through the openings 100, 104 of the respective<br>
control passages 84, 86. Thus, fluid is provided at a second, higher pressure level<br>
through the first and second control passages 84, 86 and respective feed channels<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
11<br>
60A, 60B to the first and second sets of hydraulic lift assemblies to cause a second,<br>
higher predetermined amount of engine valve lift.<br>
[0032]	Referring again to Figure 1, the single hydraulic circuit module 10 is<br>
attached between spark plug towers 110 of adjacent engine cylinders. Specifically,<br>
the cylinder head 12 partially forms six separate cylinders 112A, 112B, 112C,<br>
112D, 112E and 112F, which may be referred to as the first through sixth cylinders,<br>
or cylinders 1-6 respectively. The single hydraulic circuit module 10 is positioned<br>
between the spark plug towers 110 of the third and fourth cylinders, 112C and<br>
112D. When the intake and exhaust camshafts are installed to rotate about the axes<br>
24 and 26, respectively, the module 10 is positioned below the camshafts.<br>
Electrical connector portions of the solenoid valves 70, 72 are positioned near the<br>
upper ends of the valves 70, 72 to be easily accessible for connection to a wiring<br>
harness and/or electronic control unit. When the module 10 is attached to the<br>
cylinder head 12, the supply passage 92 is aligned with a fluid supply gallery<br>
positioned therebelow, as shown by gallery 96 in Figure 2. The first control<br>
passage 84 aligns with the first feed passage 60A. The first feed passage 60A is in<br>
fluid communication with a hydraulic lash adjuster identical to hydraulic lash<br>
adjuster 32 of Figure 3 at each of the first, second and third cylinders, 112A, 112B<br>
and 112(1 Similarly, the second control passage 86 is aligned with a second feed<br>
passage 60B which is placed in fluid communication with hydraulic lash adjusters<br>
such as those described with respect to Figure 3 for cylinders 4, 5 and 6 (112D,<br>
112E and 112F), with the second feed passage 60B being operatively connected with<br>
respect to the hydraulic lash adjuster similar to the operative connection of hydraulic<br>
lash adjuster 32 with feed passage 60A as shown in Figure 3.<br>
[0033]	Thus, the single hydraulic circuit module 10 allows lift control of<br>
multiple engine valves. In fact two sets of multiple engine valves are controlled by<br>
module 10, the first set being engine valves located at cylinders 1 through 3 (112A,<br>
112B and 112C), and the second set being engine valves located at cylinders 4<br>
through 6 (112D, 112E and 112F). By removing the supply passage 92 and control<br>
passages 84 and 86 from the cylinder head 12 and instead packaging them in control<br>
module 10, control of multiple valves is afforded while reducing the complexity of<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
12<br>
the cylinder head 12. Additionally, the module 10 may be preassembled and tested<br>
prior to attachment to the cylinder head.<br>
[0034]	Referring to Figure 4, a second embodiment of a single hydraulic<br>
circuit module 210 will now be described. The module 210 includes a housing 268<br>
which supports first and second solenoid valves 270, 272, respectively. As shown<br>
in Figure 5, the solenoid valves 270, 272 are supported on first and second flanges<br>
271, 273 of housing 268, which secure the valves 270, 272 via valve bolts 275.<br>
The housing 268 also forms first and second chambers 274, 278 respectively. The<br>
first chamber 274 houses the first solenoid valve body 276 which is visible in Figure<br>
6. The second chamber 278 houses the second solenoid valve body 280, also visible<br>
in Figure 6. Referring again to Figure 5, the housing 268 has bolt openings 220<br>
which allow the housing 268 to be connected to a cylinder head 212 as illustrated in<br>
Figure 6 via bolts 218. When assembled, electrical connector portions 277, 279 of<br>
the respective solenoid valves 270, 272 are accessible above the housing 268.<br>
[0035]	Referring now to Figure 4, the housing 268 is preferably a cast<br>
member that forms a supply passage 292. Supply passage 292 includes a fluid<br>
supply channel 225 as well as a first supply aperture 227 and a second supply<br>
aperture 229. The supply apertures 227 and 229 extend through the housing 268.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, which shows the housing 268 taken in partial cross-sectional<br>
view at the arrows shown in Figure 4, when the supply module 210 is mounted to<br>
the cylinder head 212, the fluid supply passage 292 is in fluid communication with a<br>
supply channel 294 in the cylinder head 212 that communicates with a fluid supply<br>
gallery 296 in the engine block (not shown) to which the cylinder head 212 is<br>
designed to be attached to form a completed engine assembly 216. Thus, fluid is<br>
provided through the fluid supply channel 294 to the fluid supply passage 292 and<br>
through the respective fluid supply apertures 227 and 229 to the solenoid valve<br>
bodies 276 and 280.<br>
[0036]	Referring again to Figure 4, the housing 268 also forms a first<br>
control passage 284 that includes a first control channel 285 as well as a first control<br>
aperture 287. The first control aperture 287 extends through the housing 268 and is<br>
in fluid communication with the first chamber 274.<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
13<br>
[0037]	The housing 268 also is formed with a second control passage 286<br>
which includes a second control channel 288 as well as a second control aperture<br>
289. The second control aperture 289 extends through the housing 268 in fluid<br>
communication with the second control chamber 278 (shown in Figure 5).<br>
[0038]	Referring to Figure 6, the first control passage 284 is in fluid<br>
communication with the first valve body 276 through the first control aperture 287,<br>
and with the first intake valve feed passage 260A formed in the cylinder head 212,<br>
which is aligned with the first control passage 284 when the housing 268 is bolted to<br>
the cylinder head 212. The first control passage 284 also aligns with a first exhaust<br>
valve feed passage 260B provided in the cylinder head 212. The second control<br>
passage 286 is in fluid communication with the second valve body 280 through the<br>
second control aperture 289 and is in fluid communication with the second intake<br>
valve feed passage 261A and a second exhaust valve feed passage 261B, both of<br>
which are provided in the cylinder head 212.<br>
[0039]	The cylinder assembly 214 is an overhead cam-type with an intake<br>
camshaft (not shown) that rotates about an intake camshaft axis 224 and an exhaust<br>
camshaft that rotates about an exhaust camshaft axis 226. The cylinder head 212<br>
partially forms four cylinders indicated schematically by upper ends thereof. The<br>
cylinders include a first cylinder 212A, a second cylinder 212B, a third cylinder<br>
212C and a fourth cylinder 212D. The first intake feed passage 260A routes<br>
through the cylinder head 212 to the vicinity of the first and second cylinders 212A,<br>
212B to provide hydraulic fluid to hydraulic lift assemblies located adjacent<br>
cylinders to cause lift of engine inlet valves as described with respect to the valve<br>
train, including hydraulic lash adjuster 32, SRFF assembly 30 and engine inlet valve<br>
36, of Figure 3.<br>
[0040]	The second intake valve feed passage 261A is routed through the<br>
cylinder head 212 to allow fluid communication with hydraulic lift assemblies<br>
positioned to cause lift of engine inlet valves for cylinders 3 and 4, 212C and 212D,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0041]	Similarly, the first exhaust feed passage 260B routes through the<br>
cylinder head 212 to provide hydraulic fluid pressure to hydraulic lift assemblies<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
14<br>
positioned to cause lift of engine exhaust valves located at cylinders 1 and 2, 212A,<br>
212B, respectively. The second exhaust feed passage 261B routes through the<br>
cylinder head 212 to allow fluid communication with hydraulic lift assemblies<br>
positioned to cause lift of engine exhaust valves at cylinders 212C and 212D.<br>
Cylinders 1 and 2 are a first set of cylinders having a first set of hydraulic lift<br>
assemblies (either for engine intake valves or engine exhaust valves) associated<br>
therewith. Cylinders 3 and 4 are a second set of cylinders having a second set of<br>
hydraulic lifters valves (either for engine intake valves or engine exhaust valves)<br>
operatively associated therewith and connected thereto.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the first and second solenoid valve bodies 276, 280<br>
are positioned between the fluid supply passage 292 and the respective first and<br>
second control passages 284, 286 to partially block fluid flow to the respective<br>
chambers 274, 278 (shown in Figure 5), thus permitting only a first, relatively low<br>
level of hydraulic fluid flow and associated pressure to the respective control<br>
passages 284, 286. Accordingly, when controlled to be in such a position, the valve<br>
bodies 276 and 280 allow only a first level of fluid flow to the respective hydraulic<br>
lift assemblies of the first and second cylinders sets 212A - 212B, 212C - 212D,<br>
respectively. However, an electronic control unit (not shown) controls the solenoid<br>
valves 270, 272 to allow the valve bodies 276, 280 to translate within the chambers<br>
274, 278 so that a greater level of fluid flow, and thus fluid pressure, is provided<br>
from the supply passage 292 to the respective first and second control passages 284,<br>
286. Those skilled in the art will readily understand the use of an electronic control<br>
unit to shift the position of a solenoid valve body to change fluid flow permitted past<br>
the valve body. It should be appreciated that the solenoid valves 270, 272 may be<br>
controlled separately from one another to allow a low pressure or high pressure flow<br>
situation independently of the other valve. Alternatively, the solenoid valves 270,<br>
272 may be controlled to simultaneously switch from low flow to high flow, or vice<br>
versa. Thus, by controlling the solenoid valves 270, 272 fluid flow and associated<br>
pressure to the respective cylinder sets 212A-212B, 212C-212D is controlled to<br>
allow a low lift or high lift of associated engine inlet valves or exhaust valves of<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
15<br>
each respective set. A single hydraulic circuit module 210 thus controls inlet and<br>
exhaust valves on four cylinders.<br>
[0042]	The housing 268 is bolted to an outer surface 223 which in this case<br>
is a side of the cylinder head 212. As used herein "side" means an outer surface of<br>
the cylinder head 212 that is generally parallel with the cylinders 212A, 212D. The<br>
side 223 in Figure 6 is positioned rearward when the engine assembly 216 is<br>
packaged in a vehicle. When the housing 268 is connected to the cylinder head 212,<br>
the electrical connected portions 277 and 279 of the respective solenoid valves 270,<br>
272 are easily accessible for testing, repair, and connection to an electronic control<br>
unit, as can be seen in Figure 6.<br>
[0043]	Referring again to Figure 4, other features of the single hydraulic<br>
circuit module 212 will now be described. A filter 293 may be positioned in fluid<br>
communication with the supply channel 294 to prevent debris from entering the<br>
module 210. Housing 268 incorporates means for exhausting each of the solenoid<br>
valves 270, 272. An exhaust passage 201 extends through the housing 268 in<br>
communication with an upper region of the first chamber 274 shown in Figure 5.<br>
Thus, fluid exhaust from the first solenoid valve 270 is provided through the exhaust<br>
passage 201. As illustrated in Figure 6, the exhaust passage 201 is in fluid<br>
communication with a drain passage 202 formed in the cylinder head 212 for<br>
draining the first solenoid 270. Similarly, an exhaust passage 203 is formed in the<br>
housing 268 (see Figure 4) and includes an aperture 205 extending through the<br>
housing 268 to an upper region of the second chamber 278 of the second solenoid<br>
valve 272. As illustrated in Figure 6, when the housing 268 is secured to the<br>
cylinder head 212, the exhaust passage 203 is in fluid communication with a drain<br>
passage 207 formed in the cylinder head 212 for draining the second solenoid valve<br>
272. Drain passages 202 and 207 formed in the cylinder head 212 are routed to a<br>
drain portion of an engine block when the cylinder 212 is connected to the engine<br>
block.<br>
[0044]	Referring again to Figure 4, the housing 268 is formed with a weep<br>
channel 209 which circumscribes and is shallower depth than the fluid supply<br>
channel 225 and the first and second control passages 284 and 286. The weep<br><br>
GP-307652<br>
16<br>
channel 209 collects any fluid that may seep between the housing 268 and the outer<br>
surface 223 (see Figure 6) of the cylinder head 212. The collected fluid is directed<br>
through a weep channel drain 211 to the inside of the cylinder head 212 for drainage<br>
back to an engine block when the engine block is connected to the cylinder head<br>
212.<br>
[0045]	A gasket 213 circumscribes the weep channel 211, the supply channel<br>
225, the first and second control passage 284, 286 and the exhaust passages 201 and<br>
203. The gasket 213 ensures an adequate seal between the module 210 and the<br>
cylinder head 212.<br>
[0046]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention<br>
