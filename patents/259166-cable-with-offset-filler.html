CABLE WITH OFFSET FILLER<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present utility application claims priority from the provisional application<br>
titled "CABLE WITH OFFSET FILLER" (Serial Number 60/516,007) that was filed on<br>
October 31, 20003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety<br>
by reference. The present application is related to an application entitled "CABLE<br>
UTILIZING VARYING LAY LENGTH MECHANISMS TO MINIMIZE ALIEN<br>
CROSSTALK", filed on the same date as the present application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to cables made of twisted conductor pairs.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to twisted pair cables for high-speed data<br>
communications applications.<br>
[0003] With the widespread and growing use of computers in communications<br>
applications, the ensuing volumes of data traffic have accentuated the need for<br>
communications networks to transmit the data at higher speeds. Moreover, advancements<br>
in technology have contributed to the design and deployment of high-speed<br>
communications devices that are capable of communicating the data at speeds greater<br>
than the speeds at which conventional data cables can propagate the data. Consequently,<br>
the data cables of typical communications networks, such as local area network (LAN)<br>
communities, limit the speed of data flow between communications devices.<br>
[0004] In order to propagate data between the communications devices, many<br>
communications networks utilize conventional cables that include twisted conductor pairs<br>
(also referred to as "twisted pairs" or "pairs"). A typical twisted pair includes two<br>
insulated conductors twisted together along a longitudinal axis.<br><br>
[0005] The twisted pair cables must meet specific standards of performance in order<br>
to efficiently and accurately transmit the data between the communication devices. If<br>
cables do not at least satisfy these standards, the integrity of their signals is jeopardized.<br>
Industry standards govern the physical dimensions, the performance, and the safety of the<br>
cables. For example, in the United States, the Electronic Industries<br>
Association/Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA) provides standards<br>
regarding the performance specifications of data cables. Several foreign countries have<br>
also adopted these or similar standards.<br>
[0006] According to the adopted standards, the performance of twisted pair cables is<br>
evaluated using several parameters, including dimensional properties, interoperability,<br>
impedance, attenuation, and crosstalk. The standards require that the cables perform<br>
within certain parameter boundaries. For instance, a maximum average outer cable<br>
diameter of .250" is specified for many twisted pair cable types. The standards also<br>
require that the cables perform within certain electrical boundaries. The range of the<br>
parameter boundaries varies depending on the attributes of the signal to be propagated<br>
over the cable. In general, as the speed of a data signal increases, the signal becomes<br>
more sensitive to undesirable influences from the cable, such as the effects of impedance,<br>
attenuation, and crosstalk. Therefore, high-speed signals require better cable performance<br>
in order to maintain adequate signal integrity.<br>
[00073 A discussion of impedance, attenuation, and crosstalk will help illustrate the<br>
limitations of conventional cables. The first listed parameter, impedance, is a unit of<br>
measure, expressed in Ohms, of the total opposition offered to the flow of an electrical<br>
signal. Resistance, capacitance, and inductance each contribute to the impedance of a<br>
cable's twisted pairs. Theoretically, the impedance of the twisted pair is directly<br>
proportional to the inductance from conductor effects and inversely proportional to the<br>
capacitance from insulator effects.<br>
[0008] Impedance is also defined as the best "path" for data to traverse. For instance,<br>
if a signal is being transmitted at an impedance of 100 Ohms, it is important that the<br><br>
cabling over which it propagates also possess an impedance of 100 Ohms. Any deviation<br>
from this impedance match at any point along the cable will result in reflection of part of<br>
the transmitted signal back towards the transmission end of the cable, thereby degrading<br>
the transmitted signal. This degradation due to signal reflection is known as return loss.<br>
[0009] Impedance deviations occur for many reasons. For example, the impedance of<br>
the twisted pair is influenced by the physical and electrical attributes of the twisted pair,.<br>
including: the dielectric properties of the materials proximate to each conductor; the<br>
diameter of the conductor; the diameter of the insulation material around the conductor;<br>
the distance between the conductors; the relationships between the twisted pairs; the<br>
twisted pair lay lengths (distance to complete one twist cycle); the overall cable lay<br>
length; and the tightness of the jacket surrounding the twisted pairs.<br>
[00103 Because the above-listed attributes of the twisted pair can easily vary over its<br>
length, the impedance of the twisted pair may deviate over the length of the pair. At any<br>
point where there is a change in the physical attributes of the twisted pair, a deviation in<br>
impedance occurs. For example, an impedance deviation will result from a simple<br>
increase in the distance between the conductors of the twisted pair. At the point of<br>
increased distance between the twisted pairs, the impedance will increase because<br>
impedance is known to be directly proportional to the distance between the conductors of<br>
the twisted pair.<br>
[0011] Greater variations in impedance will result in worse signal degradation.<br>
Therefore, the allowable impedance variation over the length of a cable is typically<br>
standardized. In particular, the EIA/TIA standards for cable performance require that the<br>
impedance of a cable vary only within a limited range of values. Typically, these ranges<br>
have allowed for substantial variations in impedance because the integrity of traditional<br>
data signals has been maintained over these ranges. However, the same ranges of<br>
impedance variations jeopardize the integrity of high-speed signals because the<br>
undesirable effects of the impedance variations are accentuated when higher speed signals<br>
are transmitted. Therefore, accurate and efficient transmissions of high-speed signals,<br><br>
such as signals with aggregate speeds approaching and surpassing 10 gigabits per second,<br>
benefit from stricter control of the impedance variations over the length of a cable. In<br>
v<br>
particular, post-manufacture manipulations of a cable, such as twisting the cable, should<br>
not introduce significant impedance mismatches into the cable.<br>
[0012] The second listed parameter useful for evaluating cable performance is<br>
attenuation. Attenuation represents signal loss as an electrical signal propagates along a<br>
conductor length. A signal, if attenuated too much, becomes unrecognizable to a<br>
receiving device. To make sure this doesn't happen, standards committees have<br>
established limits on the amount of loss that is acceptable.<br>
[0013] The attenuation of a signal depends on several factors, including: the dielectric<br>
constants of the materials surrounding the conductor; the impedance of the conductor; the<br>
frequency of the signal; the length of the conductor; and the diameter of the conductor. In<br>
order to help ensure acceptable attenuation levels, the adopted standards regulate some of<br>
these factors. For example, the EIA/TIA standards govern the allowable sizes of<br>
conductors for the twisted pairs.<br>
[0014] The materials surrounding the conductors affect signal attenuation because<br>
materials with better dielectric properties (e.g., lower dielectric constants) tend to<br>
minimize signal loss. Accordingly, many conventional cables use materials such as<br>
polyethylene and fmorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) to insulate the conductors. These<br>
materials usually provide lower dielectric loss than other materials with higher dielectric<br>
constants, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Further, some conventional cables have<br>
sought to reduce signal loss by maximizing the amount of air surrounding the twisted<br>
pairs. Because of its low dielectric constant (1.0), air is a good insulator against signal<br>
attenuation.<br>
[0015] The material of the jacket also affects attenuation, especially when a cable<br>
does not contain internal shielding. Typical jacket materials used with conventional<br>
cables tend to have higher dielectric constants, which can contribute to greater signal loss.<br><br>
Consequently, many conventional cables use a "loose-tube" construction that helps<br>
distance the jacket from unshielded twisted pairs.<br>
[0016] The third listed parameter that affects cable performance is crosstalk.<br>
Crosstalk represents signal degradation due to capacitive and inductive coupling between<br>
the twisted pairs. Each active twisted pair naturally produces electromagnetic fields<br>
(collectively "the fields" or "the interference fields") about its conductors. These fields<br>
are also known as electrical noise or interference because the fields can undesirably affect<br>
the signals being transmitted along other proximate conductors. The fields typically<br>
emanate outwardly from the source conductor over a finite distance. The strengths of the<br>
fields dissipate as the distances of the fields from the source conductor increase.<br>
[0017] The interference fields produce a number of different types of crosstalk. Near-<br>
end crosstalk (NEXT) is a measure of signal coupling between the twisted pairs at<br>
positions near the transmitting end of the cable. At the other end of the cable, far-end<br>
crosstalk (FEXT) is a measure of signal coupling between the twisted pairs at a position<br>
near the receiving end of the cable. Powersum crosstalk represents a measure of signal<br>
coupling between all the sources of electrical noise within a cable entity that can<br>
potentially affect a signal, including multiple active twisted pairs. Alien crosstalk refers<br>
to a measure of signal coupling between the twisted pairs of different cables. In other<br>
words, a signal on a particular twisted pair of a first cable can be affected by alien<br>
crosstalk from the twisted pairs of a proximate second cable. Alien Power Sum<br>
Crosstalk (APSNEXT) represents a measure of signal coupling between all noise sources<br>
outside of a cable that can potentially affect a signal.<br>
[0018] The physical characteristics of a cable's twisted pairs and their relationships to<br>
each other help determine the cable's ability to control the effects of crosstalk. More<br>
specifically, there are several factors known to influence crosstalk, including: the distance<br>
between the twisted pairs; the lay lengths of the twisted pairs; the types of materials used;<br>
the consistency of materials used; and the positioning of twisted pairs with dissimilar lay<br>
lengths in relation to each other. In regards to the distance between the twisted pairs of<br><br>
the cable, it is known that the effects of crosstalk within a cable decrease when the<br>
distance between twisted pairs is increased. Based on this knowledge, some conventional<br>
cables have sought to maximize the distance between each particular cable's twisted<br>
pairs.<br>
[0019] In regards to the lay lengths of the twisted pairs, it-is generally known that,<br>
twisted pairs with similar lay lengths (i.e., parallel twisted pairs) are more susceptible to<br>
crosstalk than are non-parallel twisted pairs. This increased susceptibility to crosstalk<br>
exists because the interference fields produced by a first twisted pair are oriented in<br>
directions that readily influence other twisted pairs that are parallel to the first twisted<br>
pair. Based on this knowledge, many conventional cables have sought to reduce intra-<br>
cable crosstalk by utilizing non-parallel twisted pairs or by varying the lay lengths of the<br>
individual twisted pairs over their lengths.<br>
[0020] It is also generally known that twisted pairs with long lay lengths (loose twist<br>
rates) are more prone to the effects of crosstalk than are twisted pairs with short lay<br>
lengths. Twisted pairs with shorter lay lengths orient their conductors at angles that are<br>
farther from parallel orientation than are the conductors of long lay length twisted pairs.<br>
The increased angular distance from a parallel orientation reduces the effects of crosstalk<br>
between the twisted pairs. Further, longer lay length twisted pairs cause more nesting to<br>
occur between pairs, creating a situation where distance between twisted pairs is reduced.<br>
This further degrades the ability of pairs to resist noise migration. Consequently, the long<br>
lay length twisted pairs are more susceptible to the effects of crosstalk, including alien<br>
crosstalk, than are the short lay length twisted pairs.<br>
[0021] Based on this knowledge, some conventional cables have sought to reduce the<br>
effects of crosstalk between long lay length twisted pairs by positioning the long lay<br>
length pairs farthest apart within the jacket of the cable. For example, in a 4-pair cable,<br>
the two twisted pairs with the longer lay lengths would be positioned farthest apart<br>
(diagonally) from each other in order to maximize the distance between them.<br><br>
[0022] With the above cable parameters in mind, many conventional cables have<br>
been designed to regulate the effects of impedance, attenuation, and crosstalk within<br>
individual cables by controlling some of the factors known to influence these<br>
performance parameters. Accordingly, conventional cables have attained levels of<br>
performance that are adequate only for the' transmission of traditional data signals.<br>
However, with the deployment of emerging high-speed communications systems and<br>
devices, the shortcomings of conventional cables are quickly becoming apparent. The<br>
conventional cables are unable to accurately and efficiently propagate the high-speed data<br>
signals that can be used by the emerging communications devices. As mentioned above,<br>
the high-speed signals are more susceptible to signal degradation due to attenuation,<br>
impedance mismatches, and crosstalk, including alien crosstalk. Moreover, the high-<br>
speed signals naturally worsen the effects of crosstalk by producing stronger interference<br>
fields about the signal conductors.<br>
[0023] Due to the strengthened interference fields generated at high data rates, the<br>
effects of alien crosstalk have become more significant to the transmission of high-speed<br>
data signals. While conventional cables could overlook the effects of alien crosstalk<br>
when transmitting traditional data signals, the techniques used to control crosstalk within<br>
the conventional cables do not provide adequate levels of isolation to protect from cable<br>
to cable alien crosstalk between the conductor pairs of high-speed signals. Moreover,<br>
some conventional cables have employed designs that actually work to increase the<br>
exposure of their twisted pairs to alien crosstalk. For example, typical star-filler cables<br>
often maintain the same cable diameter by reducing the thickness of their jackets and<br>
actually pushing their twisted pairs closer to the jacket surface, thereby worsening the<br>
effects of alien crosstalk by bringing the twisted pairs of proximate conventional cables<br>
closer together.<br>
[0024] The effects of powersum crosstalk are also increased at higher data<br>
transmission rates. Traditional signals such as 10 megabits per second and 100 megabits<br>
per second Ethernet signals typically use only two twisted pairs for propagation over<br><br>
conventional cables. However, higher speed signals require increased bandwidth.<br>
Accordingly, high-speed signals, such as 1 gigabit per second and 10 gigabits per second<br>
Ethernet signals, are usually transmitted in full-duplex mode (2-way transmission over a<br>
twisted pair) over more than two twisted pairs, thereby increasing the number of sources<br>
of crosstalk. Consequently, conventional cables are not capable of overcoming the,<br>
increased effects of powersum crosstalk that are produced by high-speed signals. More<br>
importantly, conventional cables cannot overcome the increases of cable to cable<br>
crosstalk (alien crosstalk), which crosstalk is increased substantially because all of the<br>
twisted pairs of adjacent cables are potentially active.<br>
[0025] Similarly, other conventional techniques are ineffective when applied to high<br>
speed communications signals. For example, as mentioned above, some traditional data<br>
signals typically need only two twisted pairs for effective transmissions. In this situation,<br>
communications systems can usually predict the interference that one twisted pair's signal<br>
will inflict on the other twisted pair's signal. However, by using more twisted pairs for<br>
transmissions, complex high-speed data signals generate more sources of noise, the<br>
effects of which are less predictable. As a result, conventional methods used to cancel<br>
out the predictable effects of noise are no longer effective. In regards to alien crosstalk,<br>
predictability methods are especially ineffective because the signals of other cables are<br>
usually unknown or unpredictable. Moreover, trying to predict signals and their coupling<br>
effects on adjacent cables is impractical and difficult.<br>
[0026] The increased effects of crosstalk due to high-speed signals pose serious<br>
problems to the integrity of the signals as they propagate along conventional cables.<br>
Specifically, the high-speed signals will be unacceptably attenuated and otherwise<br>
degraded by the effects of alien crosstalk because conventional cables traditionally focus<br>
on controlling intra-cable crosstalk and are not designed to adequately combat the effects<br>
of alien crosstalk produced by high-speed signal transmissions.<br>
[0027] Conventional cables have used traditional techniques to reduce intra-cable<br>
crosstalk between twisted pairs. However, conventional cables have not applied those<br><br>
techniques to the alien crosstalk between adjacent cables. For one, conventional cables<br>
have been able to comply with specifications for slower traditional data signals without<br>
having to be concerned with controlling alien crosstalk. Further, suppressing alien<br>
crosstalk is more difficult than controlling intra-cable cross-talk because, unlike intra-<br>
cable crosstalk from known sources, alien crosstalk cannot be precisely measured ox<br>
predicted. Alien crosstalk is difficult to measure because it typically comes from<br>
unknown sources at unpredictable intervals.<br>
[0028] As a result, conventional cabling techniques have not been successfully used<br>
to control alien crosstalk. Moreover, many traditional techniques cannot be easily used to<br>
control alien crosstalk. For example, digital signal processing has been used to cancel out<br>
or compensate for effects of intra-cable crosstalk. However, because alien crosstalk is<br>
difficult to measure or predict, known digital signal processing techniques cannot be cost<br>
effectively applied. Thus, there exists an inability in conventional cables to control alien<br>
crosstalk.<br>
[0029] In short, conventional cables cannot effectively and accurately transmit high-<br>
speed data signals. Specifically, the conventional cables do not provide adequate levels<br>
of protection and isolation from impedance mismatches, attenuation, and crosstalk. For<br>
example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) estimates that in<br>
order to effectively transmit 10 Gigabit signals at 100 megahertz (MHz), a cable must<br>
provide at least 60 dB of isolation against noise sources outside of the cable, such as<br>
adjacent cables. However, conventional cables of twisted conductor pairs typically<br>
provide isolations well short of the 60 dB needed at a signal frequency of 100 MHz,<br>
usually around 32 dB. The cables radiate about nine times more noise than is specified<br>
for 10 Gigabit transmissions over a 100 meter cabling media. Consequently,<br>
conventional twisted pair cables cannot transmit the high-speed communications signals<br>
accurately or efficiently.<br>
[0030] Although other types of cables have achieved over 60 dB of isolation at 100<br>
MHz, these types of cables have shortcomings that make their use undesirable in many<br><br>
communications systems, such as LAN communities. A shielded twisted pair cable or a<br>
fiber optic cable may achieve adequate levels of isolation for high-speed signals, but these<br>
types of cables cost considerably more than unshielded twisted pairs. Unshielded systems<br>
typically enjoy significant cost savings, which savings increase the desirability of<br>
unshielded systems as a transmitting medium. Moreover, conventional unshielded<br>
twisted pair cables are already well-established in a substantial number of existing<br>
communications systems. It is desirable for unshielded twisted pair cables to<br>
communicate high-speed communication signals efficiently and accurately. Specifically,<br>
it is desirable for unshielded twisted pair cables to achieve performance parameters<br>
adequate for maintaining the integrity of high-speed data signals during efficient<br>
transmission over the cables.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
I. INTRODUCTION OF ELEMENTS AND DEFINITIONS<br>
[0056] The present invention relates in general to cables configured to accurately and<br>
efficiently propagate high-speed data signals, such as data signals approaching and<br>
surpassing data rates of 10 gigabits per second. Specifically, the cables can be configured .<br><br>
to efficiently propagate the high-speed data signals while maintaining the integrity of the<br>
data signals.<br>
A. Cabled Group View<br>
[0057] Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a cabled<br>
group, shown generally at 100, that includes two cables 120 positioned generally along<br>
parallel axes, or longitudinally adjacent to each other. The cables 120 are configured to<br>
create points of contact 140 and air pockets 160 between the cables 120. As shown in<br>
Fig. 1, the cables 120 can be independently twisted about their own longitudinal axes.<br>
The cables 120 may be rotated at dissimilar twist rates. Further, the twist rate of each<br>
cable 120 may vary over the longitudinal length of the cable 120. As mentioned above,<br>
the twist rate can be measured by the distance of a complete twist cycle, which is referred<br>
to as lay length.<br>
[0058] The cables 120 include elevated points along their outer edges, referred to as<br>
ridges 180. The twisting of the cables 120 causes the ridges 180 to helically rotate along<br>
the outer edge of each cable 120, resulting in the formation of the air pockets 160 and the<br>
points of contact 140 at different locations along the longitudinally extending cables 120.<br>
The ridges 180 help maximize the distance between the cables 120. Specifically, the<br>
ridges 180 of the twisted cables 120 help prevent the cables 120 from nesting together.<br>
The cables 120 touch only at their ridges, which ridges 180 help increase the distance<br>
between the twisted conductor pairs 240 (not shown; see Fig. 2) of the cables 120. At<br>
non-contact points along the cables 120, the air pockets 160 are formed between the<br>
cables 120. Like the ridges 180, the air pockets 160 help increase the distance between<br>
the twisted conductor pairs 240 of the cables 120.<br>
[0059] By maximizing the distance, in part through twist rotations, between the<br>
sheathed cables 120, the interference between the cables 120, especially the effects of<br>
alien crosstalk, is reduced. As mentioned, capacitive and inductive interference fields are<br>
known to emanate from the high-speed data signals being propagated along the cables<br><br>
120. The strength of the fields increases with an increase in the speed of the data<br>
transmissions. Therefore, the cables 120 minimize the effects of the interference fields by<br>
increasing distances between adjacent cables 120. For example, the increased distances<br>
between the cables 120 help reduce alien crosstalk between the cables 120 because the<br>
effects of alien crosstalk are inversely proportional to distance.<br>
[0060] Although Fig. 1 shows two cables 120, the cabled group 100 may include any<br>
number of cables 120. The cabled group 100 may include a single cable 120. In some<br>
embodiments, two cables 120 are positioned along generally parallel longitudinal axes<br>
over at least a predefined distance. In other embodiments, more than two cables 120 are<br>
positioned along generally parallel longitudinal axes over at least the predefined distance.<br>
In some embodiments, the predefined distance is a ten meter length. In some<br>
embodiments, the adjacent cables 120 are independently twisted. In other embodiments,<br>
the cables 120 are twisted together.<br>
[0061] The cabled group 100 can be used in a wide variety of communications<br>
applications. The cabled group 100 may be configured for use in communications<br>
' networks, such as a local area network (LAN) community. In some embodiments, the<br>
cabled group 100 is configured for use as a horizontal network cable or a backbone cable<br>
in a network community. The configuration of the cables 120, including their individual<br>
twist rates, will be further explained below.<br>
B. Cable View<br>
[0062] Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of the cable 120, with a<br>
cutaway section exposed. The cable 120 includes a filler 200 configured to separate a<br>
number of the twisted conductor pairs 240 (also referred to as "the twisted pairs 240,"<br>
"the pairs 240," and "the cabled embodiments 240"), including twisted pair 240a and<br>
twisted pair 240b. The filler 200 extends generally along a longitudinal axis, such as the<br>
longitudinal axis of one of the twisted pairs 240. A jacket 260 surrounds the filler 200<br>
and the twisted pairs 240.<br><br>
[0063] The twisted pairs 240 can be independently and helically twisted about<br>
individual longitudinal axes. The twisted pairs 240 may be distinguished from each other<br>
by being twisted at generally dissimilar twist rates, i.e., different lay lengths, over a<br>
specific longitudinal distance. In Fig. 2, the twisted pair 240a is twisted more tightly than<br>
the twisted pair 240b (i.e., the twisted pair 240a has a shorter lay length than the twisted,<br>
pair 240b). Thus, the twisted pair 240a can be said to have a short lay length, and the<br>
twisted pair 240b to have a long lay length. By having different lay lengths, the twisted<br>
pair 240a and the twisted pair 240b minimize the number of parallel crossover points that<br>
are known to readily carry crosstalk noise.<br>
[0064] As shown in Fig. 2, the cable 120 includes the helically rotating ridge 180 that<br>
rotates as the cable 120 is twisted about a longitudinal axis. The cable 120 can be<br>
•twisted about the longitudinal axis at various cable lay lengths. It should be noted that the<br>
lay length of the cable 120 affects the individual lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240.<br>
When the lay length of the cable 120 is shortened (tighter twist rate), the individual lay<br>
lengths of the twisted pairs 240 are shortened, also. The cable 120 can be configured to<br>
beneficially affect the lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240, which configurations will be<br>
further explained in relation to the cable 120 lay length limitations.<br>
[0065] Fig. 2 also shows the filler 200 helically twisted about a longitudinal axis.<br>
The filler 200 can be twisted at different or variable twist rates along a predefined<br>
distance. Accordingly, the filler 200 is configured to be flexible and rigid - flexible for<br>
twisting at different twist rates and rigid for maintaining the different twist rates. The<br>
filler 200 should be twisted enough, i.e., have a small enough lay length, to form the air<br>
pockets 160 between adjacent cables 120. By way of example only, in some<br>
embodiments, the filler 200 is twisted at a lay length of no more than approximately one-<br>
hundred times the lay length of one of the twisted pairs 240 in order to form the air<br>
pockets 160. The filler 200 will be further discussed in relation to Fig. 4A.<br>
[0066] The filler 200 and the jacket 260 can include any material that meets industry<br>
standards. The filler can comprise but is not limited to any of the following:<br><br>
polyfluoroalkoxy, TFE/Perfluoromethyl-vinylether, ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene,<br>
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a lead-free flame retardant PVC, fluorinated ethylene<br>
propylene (FEP), fluorinated perfluoroethylene polypropylene, a type of fluoropolymer,<br>
flame retardant polypropylene, and other thermoplastic materials. Similarly, the jacket<br>
260 may comprise any material that meets industry standards, including any of the<br>
materials listed above.<br>
[0067] The cable 120 can be configured to satisfy industry standards, such as safety,<br>
electrical, and dimensional standards. In some embodiments, the cable 120 comprises a<br>
horizontal or backbone network cable 120. In such embodiments, the cable 120 can be<br>
configured to satisfy industry safety standards for horizontal network cables 120. In some<br>
embodiment, the cable 120 is plenum rated. In some embodiments, the cable 120 is riser<br>
rated. In some embodiments, the cable 120 is unshielded. The advantages generated by<br>
the configurations of the cable 120 are further explained below in reference to Fig. 4A.<br>
C. Twisted Pair View<br>
[0068] Fig. 3 is a perspective view of one of the twisted pairs 240. As shown in Fig.<br>
3, the cabled embodiment 240 includes two conductors 300 individually insulated by<br>
insulators 320 (also referred to as "insulation 320"). One conductor 300 and its<br>
surrounding insulator 320 are helically twisted together with the other conductor 300 and<br>
insulator 320 down a longitudinal axis. Fig. 3 further indicates the diameter (d) and the<br>
lay length (L) of the twisted pair 240. In some embodiments, the twisted pair 240 is<br>
shielded.<br>
[0069] The twisted pair 240 can be twisted at various lay lengths. In some<br>
embodiments, the twisted pair's 240 conductors 300 are twisted generally longitudinally<br>
down said axis at a specific lay length (L). In some embodiments, the lay length (L) of<br>
the twisted pair 240 varies over a portion or all of the longitudinal distance of the twisted<br>
pair 240, which distance may be a predefined distance or length. By way of example<br><br>
only, in some embodiments, the predefined distance is approximately ten meters to allow<br>
enough length for correct propagation of signals as a consequence of their wavelengths.<br>
[0070] The twisted pair 240 should conform to the industry standards, including<br>
standards governing the size of the twisted pair 240. Accordingly, the conductors 300<br>
and insulators 320 are configured to have good physical and electrical characteristics that<br>
at least satisfy the industry standards. It is known that a balanced twisted pair 240 helps<br>
to cancel out the interference fields that are generated in and about its active conductors<br>
300. Accordingly, the sizes of the conductors 300 and the insulators 320 should be<br>
configured to promote balance between the conductors 300.<br>
[0071] Accordingly, the diameter of each of the conductors 300 and the diameter of<br>
each of the insulators 320 are sized to promote balance between each single (one<br>
conductor 300 and one insulator) of the twisted pair 240. The dimensions of the cable<br>
120 components, such as the conductors 300 and the insulators 320, should comply with<br>
industry standards. In some embodiments, the dimensions, or size, of the cables 120 and<br>
their components comply with industry dimensional standards for RJ-45 cables and<br>
connectors, such as RJ-45 jacks and plugs. In some embodiments, the industry<br>
dimensional standards include standards for Category 5, Category 5e, and/or Category 6<br>
cables and connectors. In some embodiments, the size of the conductors 300 is between<br>
#22 American Wire Gage (AWG) and #26 AWG.<br>
[0072] Each of the conductors 300 of the twisted pair 240 can comprise any<br>
conductive material that meets industry standards, including but not limited to copper<br>
conductors 300. The insulator 320 may comprise but is not limited to thermoplastics,<br>
fluoropolymer materials, flame retardant polyethylene (FRPE), flame retardant<br>
polypropylene (FRPP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP),<br>
perfluoralkoxy (PFA), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) in solid or foamed form,<br>
foamed ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE), and the like.<br><br>
D. Cross-sectional View of Cable<br>
[0073] Fig. 4A shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the cable 120 according to<br>
a first embodiment of the invention. As shown in Fig. 4A, the jacket 260 surrounds the<br>
filler 200 and the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, 240d (collectively "the twisted pairs<br>
240") to form the cable 120. The twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, 240d can be<br>
distinguished by having dissimilar lay lengths. While the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c,<br>
240d may have dissimilar lay lengths, they should be twisted in the same direction in<br>
order to minimize impedance mismatches, either all twisted pairs 240 having a right-hand<br>
twist or a left-hand twist. The lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240b, 240d are preferably<br>
similar, and the lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240a, 240c are preferably similar. In some<br>
embodiments, the lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240a, 240c are less than the lay lengths<br>
of the twisted pairs 240b, 240d. In such embodiments, the twisted pairs 240a, 240c can<br>
be referred to as the shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c, and the twisted pairs<br>
240b, 240d can be referred to as the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. The<br>
twisted pairs 240 are shown selectively positioned in the cable 120 to minimize alien<br>
crosstalk. The selective positioning of the twisted pairs 240 will be further discussed<br>
below.<br>
[0074] The filler 200 can be positioned along the twisted pairs 240. The filler 200<br>
may form regions, such as quadrant regions, each region being configured to selectively<br>
receive and house a particular twisted pair 240. The regions form longitudinal grooves<br>
along the length of the filler 200, which grooves can house the twisted pairs 240. As<br>
shown in Fig. 4A, the filler 200 can include a core 410 and a number of filler dividers 400<br>
that extend radially outward from the core 410. Li some preferred embodiments, the core<br>
410 of the filler 200 is positioned at a point approximately central to the twisted pairs<br>
240. The filler 200 further includes a number of legs 415 extending radially outward<br>
from the core 410. The twisted pairs 240 can be positioned adjacent to the legs 410<br>
and/or the filler dividers 400. In some preferred embodiments, the length of each leg 415<br><br>
is at least generally equal to approximately the diameter of the twisted pair 240<br>
selectively positioned adjacent to the leg 415.<br>
[0075] The legs 415 and the core 410 of the filler 200 can be referred to as a base<br>
portion 500 of the filler 200. Fig. 5A is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the filler 200<br>
according to the first embodiment. In Fig. 5A, the filler 200 includes a base portion 500<br>
that comprises the legs 415, the dividers 400, and the core of the filler 200. In some<br>
embodiments, the base portion 500 includes any part of the filler 200 that does not extend<br>
beyond the diameter of the twisted pairs 240, while the twisted pairs 240 are selectively<br>
housed by the regions formed by the filler 200. Accordingly, the twisted pairs 240 should<br>
be positioned adjacent to the legs 415 of the base portion 500 of the filler 200.<br>
[0076] Referring back to Fig. 4A, the filler 200 can include a number of filler<br>
extensions 420a, 420b (collectively "the filler extensions 420") extending radially<br>
outward in different directions from the base portion 500, and specifically extending from<br>
the legs 415 of the base portion 500. The extension 420 to the leg 415 may extend<br>
radially outward away from the base portion 500 at least a predefined extent. As shown<br>
in Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A, the length of the predefined extent may be different for each<br>
extension 420a, 420b. The predefined extent of the extension 420a is a length E1, while<br>
the predefined extent of the extension 420b is a length E2. In some embodiments, the<br>
predefined extent of the extension 420 is at least approximately one-quarter the diameter<br>
of one of the twisted pairs 240 housed by the filler 200. By having a predefined extent of<br>
at least approximately this distance, the filler extension 420 offsets the filler 200, thereby<br>
helping to decrease alien crosstalk between adjacent cables 120 by maximizing the<br>
distance between the respective twisted pairs 240 of the adjacent cables 120.<br>
[0077] Fig. 4A shows a reference point 425 located at a position on each leg 415 of<br>
the filler 200, The reference point 425 is useful for measuring the distance between<br>
adjacently positioned cables 120. The reference point 425 is located at a certain length<br>
away from the core 410 of the filler 200. In Fig. 4A and other preferred embodiments,<br>
the reference point 425 is located at approximately the midpoint of each leg 415. In other<br><br>
words, some embodiments include the reference point 425 at a position that is distanced<br>
from the core 410 by approximately one-half the length of the diameter of one of the<br>
housed twisted pairs 240.<br>
[0078] The filler 200 may be shaped to configure the regions to fittingly house the<br>
twisted pairs 240. For example, the filler 200 can include curved shapes and edges that<br>
generally fit to the shape of the twisted pairs 240. Accordingly, the twisted pairs 240 are<br>
able to nest snugly against the filler 200 and within the regions. For example, Fig. 4A<br>
shows that the filler 200 may include concave curves configured to house the twisted<br>
pairs 240. By tightly housing the twisted pairs 240, the filler 200 helps to generally fix<br>
the twisted pairs 240 in position with respect to one another, thereby minimizing<br>
impedance deviations and capacitive unbalance over the length of the cable 120, which<br>
benefit will be further discussed below.<br>
[0079] The filler 200 can be offset. Specifically, the filler extension 420 may be<br>
configured to offset the filler 200. For example, in Fig. 4A, each of the filler extensions<br>
420 extends beyond an outer edge of the cross-sectional area of at least one of the twisted<br>
pairs 240, which length is referred to as the predefined extent. In other words, the<br>
extensions 420 extend away from the base portion 500. The filler extension 420a extends<br>
beyond the cross-sectional area of the twisted pair 240b and the twisted pair 240d by the<br>
distance (E1). In similar fashion, the filler extension 420b extends beyond the cross-<br>
sectional area of the twisted pair 240a and the twisted pair 240c by the distance (E2).<br>
Accordingly, the filler extensions 420 may be different lengths, e.g., the extension length<br>
(E1) is greater than the extension length (E2). As a result, the filler extension 420a has a<br>
cross-sectional area that is larger than the cross-sectional area of the filler extension 420b.<br>
[0080] The offset filler 200 helps minimize alien crosstalk. In addition, alien<br>
crosstalk between adjacent cables 120 can be further minimized by offsetting the filler<br>
200 by at least a minimum amount. Accordingly, the extension lengths of symmetrically<br>
positioned filler extensions 420 should be different to offset the filler 200. The filler 200<br>
should be offset enough to help form the air pockets 160 between helically twisted<br><br>
adjacent cables 120. The air pockets 160 should be large enough to help maintain at least<br>
an average minimum distance between adjacent cables 120 over at least a predefined<br>
length of the adjacent cables 120. In addition, the offset fillers 200 of adjacent cables 120<br>
can function to distance the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of one of the<br>
cables 120 farther away from outside adjacent noise sources, such as close proximity.<br>
cabling embodiments, than are the shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c. For<br>
example, in some embodiments, the extension length (E1) is approximately two times the<br>
extension length (E2). By way of example only, in some embodiments, the extension<br>
length (E1) is approximately 0.04 inches (1.016 mm), and the extension length (E2) is<br>
approximately 0.02 inches (0.508 mm). Subsequently, the longer lay length pairs 240b,<br>
240d could be placed next to the longest extension 420a to maximize the distance<br>
between the long lay length pairs 240b, 240d and any outside adjacent noise sources.<br>
[0081] Not only should symmetrically positioned filler extensions 420 be of different<br>
lengths to offset the filler 200, the filler extensions 420 of the cable 120 preferably extend<br>
at least a minimum extension length. In particular, the filler extensions 420 should<br>
extend beyond a cross-sectional area of the twisted pairs 240 enough to help form the air<br>
pockets 160 between adjacent cables 120 that are helically twisted, which air pockets 160<br>
can help maintain at least an approximate minimum average distance between the<br>
adjacent cables 120 over at least the predefined length. For example, in some preferred<br>
embodiments, at least one of the filler extensions 420 extends beyond the outer edge of a<br>
cross-sectional area of at least one of the twisted pairs 240 by at least one-quarter of the<br>
diameter (d) of the same twisted pair 240, while the twisted pair 240 is housed adjacent to<br>
the filler 200. In other preferred embodiments, an air pocket 160 is formed having a<br>
maximum extent of at least 0.1 times the diameter of a diameter of one of the cables 120.<br>
The effects of the extension lengths (E1, E2) and the offset filler 200 on alien crosstalk<br>
will be further discussed below.<br>
[0082] The cross-sectional area of the filler 200 can be enlarged to help improve the<br>
performance of the cable 200. Specifically, the filler extension 420 of the cable 120 can<br><br>
be enlarged, e.g., radiused radially outward toward the jacket 260, to help generally fix<br>
the twisted pairs 240 in position with respect to one another. As shown in Fig. 4A, the<br>
filler extensions 420a, 420b can be expanded to comprise different cross-sectional areas.<br>
Specifically, by enlarging the cross-sectional areas of the filler 200, the undesirable<br>
effects of impedance mismatch and capacitive unbalance are minimized, thereby making<br>
the cable 120 capable of performing at high data rates while maintaining signal integrity.<br>
These benefits will be further discussed below.<br>
[0083] Further, the outer edges of the filler extensions 420 can be curved to support<br>
the jacket 260 while allowing the jacket 260 to tightly fit over the filler extensions 420.<br>
The curvature of the outer edges of the filler extensions 420 helps to improve the<br>
performance of the cable 120 by minimizing impedance mismatches and capacitive<br>
unbalance. Specifically, by fitting snugly against the jacket 260, the filler extensions 420<br>
reduce the amount of air in the cable 120 and generally fix the components of the cable<br>
120 in position, including the positions of the twisted pairs 240 with respect to one<br>
another. In some preferred embodiments, the jacket 260 is compression fitted over the<br>
filler 200 and the twisted pairs 240. The benefit of these attributes will be further<br>
discussed below.<br>
[0084] The filler extensions 420 form the ridges 180 along the outer edge of the cable<br>
120. The ridges 180 are elevated at different heights according to the lengths of the filler<br>
extensions 420. As shown in Fig. 4A, the ridge 180a is more elevated than the ridge<br>
180b. This helps to offset the cables 120 in order to reduce alien crosstalk between<br>
adjacent cables 120, which characteristic will be further discussed below.<br>
[0085] A measure of the greatest diameter (D1) of the cable 120 is also shown in Fig.<br>
4A. For the cable 120 shown in Fig. 4A, the diameter (D1) is the distance between the<br>
ridge 180a and the ridge 180b. As mentioned above, the cable 120 can be a particular<br>
size or diameter such that it complies with certain industry standards. For example, the<br>
cable 120 may be a size that complies with Category 5, Category 5e, and/or Category 6<br><br>
unshielded cables. By way of example only, in some embodiments, the diameter (D1) of<br>
the cable 120 is no more than 0.25 inches (6.35 mm).<br>
[0086] By complying with existing dimensional standards for unshielded twisted pair<br>
cables, the cable 120 can easily be used to replace existing cables. For example, the cable<br>
120 can readily be substituted for a category 6 unshielded cable in a network of<br>
communication devices, thereby helping to increase the available data propagation speeds<br>
between the devices. Further, the cable 120 can be readily connectable with existing<br>
connector devices and schemes. Thus, the cable 120 can help improve the<br>
communications speeds between devices of existing networks.<br>
[0087] Although Fig. 4A shows two filler extensions 420, other embodiments can<br>
include various numbers and configurations of filler extensions 420. Any number of<br>
filler extensions 420 may be used to increase the distances between cables 120 positioned<br>
proximate to one another. Similarly, filler extensions 420 of different or similar lengths<br>
can be used. The distance provided between the adjacent cables 120 by the filler<br>
extensions 420 reduces the effects of interference by increasing the distance between the<br>
cables 120. In some embodiments, the filler 200 is offset to facilitate the distancing of<br>
the cables 120 as the cables 120 are individually rotated. The offset filler 200 then helps<br>
isolate a particular cable's 120 twisted pairs 240 from the alien crosstalk generated by<br>
another cable's 120 twisted pairs 240.<br>
[0088] To illustrate examples of other embodiments of the cable 120, Figs. 4B-4C<br>
show various different embodiments of the cable 120. Fig. 4B shows an enlarged cross-<br>
sectional view of a cable 120' according to a second embodiment... The cable 120' shown<br>
in Fig. 4B includes a filler 200' that includes three legs 415 and three filler extensions 420<br>
extending away from the legs 415 and beyond the cross-sectional areas of the twisted<br>
pairs 240. Each of the legs 415 includes the reference point 415. The filler 200' can<br>
function in any of the ways discussed above in relation to the filler 200, including helping<br>
to distance adjacently positioned cables 120' from one another.<br><br>
[0089] Similarly, Fig. 4C shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of a cable 120"<br>
according to a third embodiment, which cable 120" includes a filler 200" with a number<br>
of legs 415 and one filler extension 420 extending away from one of the legs 415 and<br>
beyond the cross-sectional area of at least one of the twisted pairs 240. The legs 415<br>
include the reference points 425. In other embodiments, the legs 415 shown in Fig. 4C<br>
can be filler dividers 400. The filler 200" can also function in any of the ways that the<br>
filler 200 can function.<br>
[0090] Fig. 5B shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the filler 200" according to<br>
the third embodiment. As shown in Fig. 5B, the filler 200" can include a base portion<br>
500" having a number of legs 415 and the extension 420 extending away from the base<br>
portion 500" and, more specifically, away from one of the legs 415 of the base portion<br>
500". Fig. 5B shows four twisted pairs 240 positioned adjacent to the base portion 500".<br>
The extension 420 extends away from the base portion 500" by at least approximately the<br>
predefined extent. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 5B, the filler 200" includes four legs<br>
415 with the twisted pairs 240 adjacent to the legs 415. Each of the legs 415 of the base<br>
portion 500" includes the reference point 425.<br>
[0091] The filler 200 can be configured in other ways for distancing adjacently<br>
positioned cables 120. For example, Fig. 4D shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of<br>
the cable 120 and the filler 200 according to the embodiment of Fig. 4A in combination<br>
with a different filler 200"" positioned along the cable 120. The filler 200"" can be<br>
helically twisted about along the cable 120, or any component of the cable 120. By being<br>
positioned along the cable 120, the filler 200"" can be positioned in between adjacently<br>
placed cables 120 and maintain a distance between them. As the filler 200"" helically<br>
twists about the cable 120, it prevents adjacent cables 120 from nesting together. The<br>
filler 200"" may be positioned along any embodiment of the cable 120. In some<br>
embodiments, the filler 200"" is positioned along the twisted pairs 240.<br>
[0092] The configuration of the cables 120, such as the embodiments shown in Figs.<br>
4A-4D, are able to adequately maintain the integrity of the high-speed data signals being<br><br>
propagated over the cables 120. The cables 120 are capable of such performance due to a<br>
number of features, including but not limited to the following. First, the cable<br>
configurations help to increase the distance between the twisted pairs 240 of adjacent<br>
cables 120, thereby reducing the effects of alien crosstalk. Second, the cables 120 can be<br>
configured to increase the distance between the radiating sources that are most prone to<br>
alien crosstalk, e.g., the longer lay length twisted pairs. 240b, 240d. Third, the cables 120<br>
may be configured to help reduce the capacitive coupling between the twisted pairs 240<br>
by improving the consistency of the dielectric properties of the materials surrounding the<br>
twisted pairs 240. Fourth, the cable 120 can be configured to minimize the variations in<br>
impedance over its length by maintaining the physical attributes of the cable 120<br>
components, even when the cable 120 is twisted, thereby reducing signal attenuation.<br>
Fifth, the cables 120 can be configured to reduce the number of instances of parallel<br>
twisted pairs 240 along longitudinally adjacent cables 120, thus minimizing the<br>
occurrences of positions that are prone to alien crosstalk. These features and advantages<br>
of the cables 120 will now be discussed in further detail.<br>
E. Distance Maximi2ation<br>
[0093] The cables 120 can be configured to minimize the degradation of propagating<br>
high-speed signals by maximizing the distance between the twisted pairs 240 of adjacent<br>
cables 120. Specifically, the distancing of the cables 120 reduces the effects of alien<br>
crosstalk. As mentioned above, the magnitudes of the fields that cause alien crosstalk<br>
weaken with distance.<br>
[0094] The adjacent cables 120 can be individually and helically twisted along generally parallel axes as shown in Fig. 1 such that the points of contact 140 and the air<br>
pockets 160 shown in Fig. 1 are formed at various positions along the adjacent cables<br>
120. The cables 120 may be twisted so that the ridges 180 form the points of contact 140<br>
between the cables 120, as discussed in relation to Fig. 1. Accordingly, at various<br>
positions along the longitudinal axes, the adjacent cables 120 may touch at their ridges<br>
180. At non-contact points, the adjacent cables 120 can be separated by the air pockets<br><br>
160. The cables 120 may be configured to increase the distance between their twisted<br>
pairs 240 at both the points of contact 140 and the non-contact points, thereby reducing<br>
alien crosstalk. In addition, by using a randomized helical twisting for different adjacent<br>
cables 120, the distance between the adjacent cables 120 is maximized by discouraging<br>
nesting of the adjacent cables 120 in relation to one another.<br>
[0095] Further, the cables 120 can be configured to maximally distance their longer<br>
lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. As mentioned above, the longer lay length twisted<br>
pairs 240b, 240d are more prone to alien crosstalk than are the shorter lay length twisted<br>
pairs 240a, 240c. Accordingly, the cables 120 may selectively position the longer lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240b, 240d proximate to the largest filler extension 420a of each<br>
cable 120 to further distance the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. This<br>
configuration will be further discussed below.<br>
1. Randomized Cable Twist<br>
[0096] The distance between adjacently positioned cables 120 can be maximized by<br>
twisting the adjacent cables 120 at different cable lay lengths. By being twisted at<br>
different rates, the peaks of one of the adjacent cables 120 do not align with the valleys of<br>
the other cable 120, thereby discouraging a nesting alignment of the cables 120 in relation<br>
to one another. Accordingly, the different lay lengths of the adjacent cables 120 help to<br>
prevent or discourage nesting of the adjacent cables 120. For example, the adjacent<br>
cables 120 shown in Fig. 1 have different lay lengths. Therefore, the number and size of<br>
the air pockets 160 formed between the cables 120 are maximized.<br>
[0097] The cable 120 can be configured to help ensure that adjacently placed sub-<br>
sections of the cable 120 do not have the same twist rate at any point along the length of<br>
the sub-sections. To this end, the cable 120 may be helically twisted along at least a<br>
predefined length of the cable 120. The helical twisting includes a torsional rotation of<br>
the cable about a generally longitudinal axis. The helical twisting of the cable 120 may<br>
be varied over the predefined length so that the cable lay length of the cable 120 either<br><br>
continuously increases or continuously decreases over the predefined length. For<br>
example, the cable 120 may be twisted at a certain cable lay length at a first point along<br>
the cable 120. The cable lay length can continuously decrease (the cable 120 is twisted<br>
tighter) along points of the cable 120 as a second point along the cable 120 is approached.<br>
As the twist of the cable 120 tightens, the distances between the spiraling ridges 180<br>
along the cable 120 decrease. Consequently, when the predefined length of the cable 120<br>
is separated into two sub-sections, and the sub-sections are positioned adjacent to one<br>
another, the sub-sections of the cable 120 will have different cable lay lengths. This<br>
discourages the sub-sections from nesting together because the ridges 180 of the cables<br>
120 spiral at different rates, thereby reducing alien crosstalk between the sub-sections by<br>
maximizing the distance between them. Further, the different twist rates of the sub-<br>
sections help minimize alien crosstalk by maintaining a certain average distance between<br>
the sub-sections over the predefined length. In some embodiments, the average distance<br>
between the closest respective reference points 425 of each of the sub-sections is at least<br>
one-half the distance of the length of a particular filler extension 420 (the predefined<br>
extent) of the sub-sections over the predefined length.<br>
[0098] Because the cable 120 is helically twisted at randomly varying rates along the<br>
predefined length, the filler 200, the twisted pairs 240, and/or the jacket 260 can be<br>
twisted correspondingly. Thus, the filler 200, the twisted pairs 240, and/or the jacket 260<br>
can be twisted such that their respective lay lengths are either continuously increased or<br>
continuously decreased over at least the predefined length. In some embodiments, the<br>
jacket 260 is applied over the filler 200 and twisted pairs 240 in a compression fit such<br>
that the application of the jacket 260 includes a twisting of the jacket 260 that causes the<br>
tightly received filler 200 to be twisted in a corresponding manner. As a result, the<br>
twisted pairs 240 received within filler 200 are ultimately helically twisted with respect to<br>
one another. In practice, randomizing the lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240 once jacket<br>
260 is applied such as by a twisting of the jacket has been found to have the added<br>
advantage or minimizing the re-introduction, of air within cable 120. In contrast, other<br><br>
approaches to randomization typically increase air content, which may actually increase<br>
undesirable cross-talk. The importance of minimizing air content is discussed below in<br>
Section G.2. Nevertheless, in some embodiments, a twisting of the filler 200<br>
independently of the jacket 260 causes the twisted pairs 240 received within the filler to<br>
be helically twisted with respect to one another.<br>
[0099] The overall twisting of the cable 120 varies an original or initial predefined lay<br>
length of each of the twisted pairs 240. The twisted pairs 240 are varied by<br>
approximately the same rate at each point along the predefined length. The rate can be<br>
defined as the amount of torsional twist applied by the overall helical twisting of the<br>
twisted pairs 240. In response to the application of the torsional twist rate, the lay length<br>
of each of the twisted pairs 240 changes a certain amount. This function and its benefits<br>
will be further discussed in relation to Figs. 11A-11B. The predefined length of the cable<br>
120 will also be further discussed in relation to Figs. 11A-11B.<br>
2. Points of Contact<br>
[00100] Figs. 6A-6D show various cross-sectional views of longitudinally adjacent and<br>
helically twisted cables 120 according to the first embodiment of the invention. Figs. 6A-<br>
6B show cross-sectional views of the cables 120 touching at different points of contact<br>
140, At these positions, the filler extensions 420 can be configured to increase the<br>
distance between the twisted pairs 240 of adjacent cables 120, thereby minimizing alien<br>
crosstalk at the points of contact 140.<br>
[00101] In Fig. 6A, the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 are separated by the<br>
distance (S1). The distance (S1) equals approximately two times the sum of the<br>
extension length (E1) and the thickness of the jacket 260. In the cable 120 position<br>
shown in Fig. 6A, the filler extensions 420a of the cables 120 increase the distance<br>
between the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 by twice the extension length<br>
(E1). The closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables 120 shown in Fig. 6A are<br>
separated by the distance S1'.<br><br>
[00102] In Fig. 6A, the adjacent cables 120 are positioned such that their respective<br>
longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d are more proximate to each other than are the<br>
shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c of the cables 120. Because the longer lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240b, 240d are more prone to alien crosstalk than are the shorter lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240a, 240c, the larger filler extensions 420a of the cables 120 are<br>
selectively positioned to provide increased distance between the longer lay length twisted<br>
pairs 240b, 240d of the cables 120. Consequently, the longer lay length twisted pairs<br>
240b, 240d of the cables 120 are further separated at the point of contact 140 shown in<br>
Fig. 6A, and thereby reducing alien crosstalk between them. In other words, the cables<br>
120 can be configured to provide maximum separation between the longer lay length<br>
twisted pairs 240b, 240d. Accordingly, the filler 200 can selectively receive and house<br>
the twisted pairs 240. For example, the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d may be<br>
. positioned most proximate to a longer filler extension 420a. This function is helpful for<br>
effectively minimizing alien crosstalk between the worst sources of alien crosstalk<br>
between the cables 120 - the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d.<br>
[00103] Fig. 6B shows a cross-sectional view of another point of contact 140 of the<br>
cables 120 along their lengths. In Fig. 6B, the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120<br>
are separated by the distance (S2). The distance (S2) equals approximately two times the<br>
sum of the extension length (E2) and the thickness of the jacket 260. In the cable 120<br>
position shown in Fig. 6B, the filler extensions 420b of the cables 120 increase the<br>
distance between the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 by twice the extension<br>
length (E2). The closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables 120 shown in Fig. 6B<br>
are separated by the distance S2'.<br>
[00104] In Fig. 6B, the adjacent cables 120 are positioned such that their respective<br>
shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c are more proximate to each other than are the<br>
longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of the cables 120. The shorter lay length<br>
twisted pairs 240a, 240c of the cables 120 are separated at the point of contact 140 shown<br>
in Fig. 6B by at least the lengths of the filler extensions 420b, thereby reducing alien<br><br>
crosstalk between them Because the shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a; 240c are less<br>
prone to alien crosstalk than are the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d, the<br>
smaller filler extensions 420b of the cables 120 are selectively positioned to distance the<br>
shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c of the cables 120. As discussed above,<br>
increased distance is more helpful for reducing alien crosstalk between the longer lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. Therefore, the larger filler extensions 420a of the cables<br>
120 are used to separate the longer lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d at positions where<br>
they are most proximate between the cables 120.<br>
3. Non-contact Points<br>
[00105] Figs. 6C-6D show cross-sectional views of the cables 120 at non-contact<br>
points along their lengths. At these positions, the cables 120 can be configured to<br>
increase the distance between the twisted pairs 240 of adjacent cables 120 by forming the<br>
air pockets 160 between the cables 120, thereby minimizing alien crosstalk at the points<br>
of contact 140. When the adjacent cables 120 are independently and helically twisted at<br>
different cable lay lengths, the filler extensions 420 help form the air pockets 160 by<br>
helping to prevent the cables 120 from nesting together. As discussed above, this<br>
distancing effect can be maximized by creating slight fluctuations in twist rotation along<br>
the longitudinal axes of the cables 120.<br>
[00106] The air pockets 160 increase the distances between the twisted pairs 240 of the<br>
cables 120. Fig. 6C shows a cross-sectional view of the adjacent cables 120 separated by<br>
a particular air pocket 160 at a position along their longitudinal lengths. At the position<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6C, the adjacent cables 120 are separated by the air pocket 160. While<br>
at this position, the air pocket 160 formed by the helically rotating ridges 180 functions to<br>
distance the most proximate twisted pairs 240 of each cable 120. The length of the air<br>
pocket 160 is the increased distance between the adjacent cables 120. In Fig. 6C, the<br>
distance between the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 at this position is<br>
indicated by the distance (S3). Because air has excellent insulation properties, the<br>
distance formed by the air pocket 160 is effective for isolating the adjacent cables 120<br><br>
from alien crosstalk. In Fig. 6C, the closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables<br>
120 are separated by the distance S3'.<br>
[00107] The cables 120 can be configured such that when their twisted pairs 240 are<br>
not separated by the filler extensions 420, the air pockets 160 are formed to distance the<br>
twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120, thereby helping to reduce alien crosstalk between the<br>
cables 120.<br>
[00108] Fig. 6D shows a cross-sectional view of the adjacent cables 120 at another air<br>
pocket 160 along their longitudinal lengths. Similar to the position shown in Fig. 6C, the<br>
cables 120 of Fig. 6D are separated by the air pocket 160. As discussed in relation to Fig.<br>
6C, the air pocket 160 shown in Fig. 6D functions to distance the nearest twisted pairs<br>
240 of the cables 120. The distance between the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables<br>
120 at this position is indicated by the distance (S4). In Fig. 6D, the closest reference<br>
points 425 of the adjacent cables 120 are separated by the distance S4'.<br>
[00109] Although Figs. 6A-6D show specific embodiments of the cables 120, other<br>
embodiments of the cables 120 can be configured to increase the distances between the<br>
twisted pairs 240 of adjacent cables 240. For example, a wide variety of filler extension<br>
420 configurations can be used to increase the distance between the adjacent cables 120.<br>
The filler 200 can include different numbers and sizes of the filler extensions 420 and the<br>
filler dividers 400 that are configured to prevent nesting of adjacent cables 120. The filler<br>
200 can include any shape or design that helps to distance the adjacent cables 120 while<br>
complying with the industry standards for cable size or diameter.<br>
[00110] For example, Fig. 7 is a cross-sectional view of longitudinally adjacent cables<br>
120' according to the second embodiment of the invention. The cables 120' shown in Fig.<br>
7 can be positioned similarly to the cables 120 shown in Figs. 6A-6D. Each of the cables<br>
120' includes the jacket 260 surrounding the filler 200', the filler divider 400, the filler<br>
extensions 420, and the twisted pairs 240. The cables 120' also include the ridges 180<br>
formed along the jackets 260 by the filler extensions 420. The elevated ridges 180 help to<br><br>
increase the distance between the twistedpairs 240 of the adjacent cables 120 because the<br>
points of contact 140 between the cables 120' occur at the ridges 180 of the cables 120'.<br>
[00111] In Fig. 7, each cable 120' includes three filler extensions 420 that extend<br>
beyond the cross-sectional areas of some of the twisted pairs 240. The filler extensions<br>
420 in Fig. 7 can function in any of the ways discussed above, such as helping to prevent<br>
nesting of helically twisted adjacent cables 120' and increasing the distances between the<br>
twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120'. In Fig. 7, the distance between the nearest twisted<br>
pairs 240 of the cables 120' at one of the point of contact 140 is indicated by the distance<br>
(S5), which is approximately two times the sum of the extension length and the thickness<br>
of the jacket 260 the cable 120'. The closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables<br>
120'shown in Fig. 7 are separated by the distance S5\ The cables 120' shown in Fig. 7<br>
can selectively position the twisted pairs 240 of different lay lengths in any of the ways<br>
discussed above. Accordingly, the cables 120' of Fig. 7 can be configured to minimize<br>
alien crosstalk.<br>
[00112] Fig. 8 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the longitudinally adjacent cables<br>
120 and the fillers 200"" using the arrangement of Fig. 4D. The cables 120 shown in Fig.<br>
8 are distanced by the helically twisting filler 200"" in any of the ways discussed above in<br>
relation to Fig. 4D.<br>
F. Selective Distance Maximization<br>
[00113] The present cable configurations, can minimize signal degradation by<br>
providing for selective positioning of the twisted pairs 240. Referring again to Fig. 4A,<br>
the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, and 240d can be independently twisted at dissimilar<br>
lay lengths. In Fig. 4A, the twisted pair 240a and the twisted pair 240c have shorter lay<br>
lengths than the longer lay lengths of the twisted pair 240b and the twisted pair 240d.<br>
[00114] As mentioned above, crosstalk more readily affects the twisted pairs 240 with<br>
long lay lengths because the conductors 300 of long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d<br>
are oriented at relatively smaller angles from a parallel orientation. On the other hand,<br><br>
shorter lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c have higher angles of separation between their<br>
conductors 300, and are, therefore, farther from being parallel and less susceptible to<br>
crosstalk noise. Consequently, twisted pair 240b and twisted pair 240d are more<br>
susceptible to crosstalk than are twisted pair 240a and twisted pair 240c. With these<br>
characteristics in mind, the cables 120 can be configured to reduce alien crosstalk by<br>
maximizing the distance between their long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d.<br>
[00115] The long lay length pairs 240b, 240d of adjacent cables 120 can be distanced<br>
by positioning them proximate to the largest filler extension 420a. For example, as<br>
shown in Fig. 4A, the extension length (E1) of filler extension 420a is greater than the<br>
extension length (E2) of filler extension 420b. By positioning the twisted pairs 240b,<br>
240d with longer lay lengths proximate to the cable's 120 largest filler extension 420a,<br>
the points of contact 140 that occur between the filler extensions 420a of the adjacent<br>
cables 120 will provide maximum distance between the long lay length twisted pairs<br>
240b, 240d. In other words, the longer lay length twisted pairs 240 are positioned more<br>
proximate to the larger filler extension 420a than are the shorter lay length twisted pairs<br>
240. Accordingly, the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of the cables 120 are<br>
separated at the point of contact 140 by at least the greatest available extension lengths<br>
(E1). This configuration and its benefits will be further explained with reference to the<br>
embodiments shown in Figs. 9A-9D.<br>
[00116] Figs. 9A-9D show cross-sectional views of longitudinally adjacent cables 120"<br>
according to the third embodiment of the inventions. In Figs. 9A-9D, the twisted adjacent<br>
cables 120" include the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d configured to maximize<br>
the distance between the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of the adjacent cables<br>
120". The cables 120" each include the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, 240d with<br>
dissimilar lay lengths. The long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d are positioned most<br>
proximate to the longest filler extension 420 of the filler 200" of each cable 120". This<br>
configuration helps minimize alien crosstalk between the long lay length twisted pairs<br>
240b, 240d of the cables 120". Figs. 9A-9D show different cross-sectional views of the<br><br>
twisted adjacent cables 120" at different positions along their longitudinally extending<br>
lengths.<br>
[00117] Fig. 9A is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of twisted adjacent cables<br>
120" configured to distance the cables' 120" long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. As<br>
shown in Fig. 9A, the cables 120" are positioned such that the filler extensions 420 of<br>
each of the cables 120" are oriented toward each other. The point of contact 140 is<br>
formed between the cables 120" at the ridges 180 located between the filler extensions<br>
420. As the cables 120" are positioned in Fig. 9A, the distance between the long lay<br>
twisted pairs 240b, 240d is approximately the sum of the lengths that the filler extensions<br>
420 extend beyond the cross-sectional area of the twisted pairs 240b, 240d, indicated by<br>
the distances (E1), and the jacket 260 thicknesses of each of the cables 120". This sum is<br>
indicated by the distance (S6). In Fig. 9A, the closest reference points 425 of the adjacent<br>
cables 120" are separated by the distance S6'. The configuration shown in Fig. 9A helps<br>
minimize alien crosstalk in any of the ways discussed above in relation to Figs. 6A-6D.<br>
[00118] Fig. 9B shows another cross-sectional view of the twisted adjacent cables<br>
120" at another position along the lengths of the longitudinally adjacent cables 120". As<br>
the cables 120" rotate the filler extensions 420 move with the rotation. In Fig. 9B, the<br>
filler extensions 420 of the cables 120" are parallel and oriented generally upward.<br>
Because the filler extension 420 causes the cable 120" to be offset, the air pocket 160 is<br>
formed between the cables 120" at this orientation of the filler extensions 420. The<br>
configuration shown in Fig. 9B helps to reduce alien crosstalk in any of the. ways<br>
discussed above in relation to Figs. 6A-6D. For example, as discussed above, the air<br>
pocket 160 helps to reduce alien crosstalk by maximizing the distance between the<br>
twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120". The distance (S7) indicates the separation between<br>
the nearest twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120". In Fig. 9B, the closest reference points<br>
425 of the adjacent cables 120" are separated by the distance S7'.<br>
[00119] Fig. 9C shows another cross-sectional view of the twisted adjacent cables<br>
120" of Fig. 9A at a different position along the lengths of the longitudinally adjacent<br><br>
cables 120". At this point, the filler extensions 420 of the cables 120" are oriented away<br>
from each other. The long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d are selectively positioned<br>
proximate to the filler extension 420, Accordingly, the long lay length twisted pairs<br>
240b, 240d are also oriented apart. The short lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c of each<br>
cable 120" are most proximate to each other. However, as mentioned above, the short lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240a, 240c are not as susceptible to crosstalk as are the long lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. Therefore, the orientation of the cables 120" shown in<br>
Fig. 9C does not unacceptably harm the integrity of high-speed signals as they are<br>
propagated along the twisted pairs 240. Other embodiments of the cables 120" include<br>
filler extensions 420 configured to further distance the short lay length twisted pairs 240a,<br>
240c.<br>
[00120] At the position shown in Fig. 9C, the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d<br>
are naturally separated by the components of the cables 120". Specifically, the areas of<br>
the short lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c of the cables 120" helps separate the long lay<br>
length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. Therefore, alien crosstalk is reduced at the configuration<br>
of the cables 120" shown in Fig. 9C. The distance between the long lay length twisted<br>
pairs 240b, 240d of the cables 120" is indicated by the distance (S8). In Fig. 9C, the<br>
closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables 120" are separated by the distance S8[00121] Fig. 9D shows another cross-sectional view of the twisted adjacent cables<br>
120" at another position along the lengths of the longitudinally adjacent cables 120". At<br>
the position shown in Fig. 9D, the filler extensions 420 of both cables 120" are oriented<br>
in the same lateral direction. The long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of each of the<br>
cables 120" remain distanced apart by the distance (S9), thus minimizing the effects of<br>
alien crosstalk between the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d. Further, the<br>
components of the cables 120", including the short lay length twisted pairs 240a, 240c of<br>
one of the cables 120" helps separate the long lay length twisted pairs 240b, 240d of the<br>
cables 120". In Fig. 9D, the closest reference points 425 of the adjacent cables 120" are<br>
separated by the distance S9'.<br><br>
G. Capacitive Field Balance<br>
[00122] The present cables 120 can facilitate balanced capacitive fields about the<br>
conductors 300 of the twisted pairs 240. As mentioned above, capacitive fields are<br>
formed between and around the conductors 300 of a particular twisted pair 240. Further,<br>
the extent of capacitive unbalance between the conductors 300 of the twisted pair 240<br>
affects the noise emitted from the twisted pair 240. If the capacitive fields of the<br>
conductors 300 are well-balanced, the noise produced by the fields tends to be canceled<br>
out. Balance is typically promoted by insuring that the diameter of the conductors 300<br>
and the insulators 320 of the twisted pair 240 are uniform. As mentioned earlier, the<br>
cable 120 utilizes twisted pairs 240 with uniform sizes that facilitate capacitive balance.<br>
[00123] However, materials other than the insulators 320 affect the capacitive fields of<br>
the conductors 300. Any material within or proximate to a capacitive field of the<br>
conductors 300 affects the overall capacitance, and ultimately the capacitive balance, of<br>
the insulated conductors 300 grouped into the twisted pair 240. As shown in Fig. 4A, the<br>
cable 120 may include a number of materials positioned where they may separately affect<br>
each insulated conductor's 300 capacitance within the twisted pair 240. This creates two<br>
different capacitances, thus creating an unbalance. This unbalance inhibits the ability of<br>
the twisted pair 240 to self-cancel noise sources, resulting in increased noise levels<br>
radiating from an active transmitting pair 240. The insulator 320, the filler 200, the jacket<br>
260, and the air within the cable 120 can all affect the capacitive balance of the twisted<br>
pairs 240. The cable 120 can be configured to include materials that help minimize any<br>
unbalancing effects, thereby maintaining the integrity of the high-speed data signals and<br>
reducing signal attenuation.<br>
1. Consistent Dielectric Materials<br>
[00124] The cable 120 can minimize capacitive unbalance by using materials with<br>
consistent dielectric properties, such as consistent dielectric constants. The materials<br>
used for the jacket 260, the filler 200, and the insulators 320 can be selected such that<br><br>
their dielectric constants are approximately the same or at least relatively close to each<br>
other. Preferably, the jacket 260, the filler 200, and the insulators 320 should not vary<br>
beyond a certain variation limit. When the materials of these components comprise<br>
dielectrics within the limit, capacitive unbalance is reduced, thereby maximizing noise<br>
attenuation to help maintain high-speed signal integrity. In some embodiments, the .<br>
dielectric constant of the filler 200, the jacket 260, and the insulator 320 are all within<br>
approximately one dielectric constant of each other.<br>
[00125] By utilizing materials with consistent dielectric properties, the cable 120<br>
minimizes capacitive unbalance by eliminating bias that may be formed by materials with<br>
different dielectric constants positioned uniquely about the twisted pair 240, especially in<br>
consequence of stronger capacitive fields generated by high-speed data signals. For<br>
example, a particular twisted pair 24 includes two conductors 300. A first conductors<br>
may be positioned proximate to the jacket 26 while the second conductor is positioned<br>
proximate to the filler 200. Consequently, the first conductor's 300 capacitive fields may<br>
experience more capacitive influence from the more proximate jacket 260 than from the<br>
less proximate filler 200. The second conductor 300 may be more biased by the filler 200<br>
than by the jacket 260. As a result, the unique biases of the conductors 300 do not cancel<br>
each other out, and the capacitive fields of the twisted pair 240 are unbalanced. Further, a<br>
greater disparity between the dielectric constants of the jacket 260 and the filler 200 will<br>
undesirably increase the unbalance of the twisted pair 240, thereby causing signal<br>
degradation. The cable 120 can minimize the bias differences, i.e., the capacitive<br>
unbalance, by utilizing materials with consistent dielectric constants for the insulator 320,<br>
the filler 200, and the jacket 260. Consequently, the capacitive fields about the<br>
conductors 300 are better balanced and result in improved noise cancellations along the<br>
length of each twisted pair within the cable 120.<br>
[00126] In some embodiments, the jacket 260 may include an inner jacket and an outer<br>
jacket with dissimilar dielectric properties. In some embodiments, a dielectric of the<br>
inner jacket, said filler 200, and said insulator 320 are all within approximately one<br><br>
dielectric constant (1) of each other. In some embodiments, a dielectric of the outer<br>
jacket is not within approximately one dielectric constant of said insulator 320. In some<br>
embodiments, there is no material within a predefined dimension from the center of the<br>
conductor 300 with a dielectric constant that varies more than approximately plus or<br>
minus one dielectric constant from the dielectric constant of the insulator 320. In some<br>
embodiments, the predefined dimension is a radius of approximately 0.025 inches (0.635<br>
mm).<br>
2. Air Minimization<br>
[00127] Because air is typically more than 1.0 dielectric constant different than the<br>
insulator 320, filler 200 material, or the jacket 260, the cable 120 can facilitate a balance<br>
of the twisted pair's 240 overall capacitive fields by minimizing the amount of air about<br>
the twisted pair 240. The amount of air can be reduced by enlarging or otherwise<br>
maximizing the area of the filler 200 for the cable 120. For example, as discussed above<br>
in relation to Fig. 4A, the area of the filler extensions 420 and /or the filler dividers 400<br>
may be increased. As shown in Fig. 4A, the filler extensions 420 of the cable 120 are<br>
expanded toward the jacket 260 to increase the cross-sectional area of the filler<br>
extensions 420.<br>
[00128] Further, as discussed above in relation to Fig. 4A, the filler 200, including the<br>
filler dividers 400 and the filler extensions 420, can include edges shaped to fittingly .<br>
accommodate the twisted pairs 240, thereby minimizing the spaces in the cable 120<br>
where air could reside. In some embodiments, the filler 200, including the filler<br>
extensions 420 and the filler dividers 400, includes curved edges shaped to house the<br>
twisted pairs 240. Further, as discussed above in relation to Fig. 4A, the filler extensions<br>
420 may include curved outer edges configured to fittingly nest with the jacket 260,<br>
thereby displacing air from between the filler extensions 420 and the jacket 260 when the<br>
jacket 260 is snugly or tightly fitted around the filler extensions 420.<br><br>
[00129] The reduction in the voids of cable 120 selectively receiving a gas such as air<br>
proximate to the twisted pair 240 helps minimize the materials with disparate dielectric<br>
constants. As a result, the unbalance of the twisted pair's 240 capacitive fields is<br>
minimized because biases toward uniquely positioned materials are prevented or at least<br>
attenuated. The overall effect is a decrease in the effects of noise emitted from the twisted pair 240. In some embodiments, the voids able to hold a gas such as air within<br>
the cross-sectional area of the twisted pair 240 makes up less than a predetermined<br>
amount of the cross-sectional area of the twisted pair 240 or of the region housing the<br>
twisted pair 240. In some embodiments, the gas within the voids makes up less than the<br>
predetermined amount of the cross-sectional area of the cable 120. In some<br>
embodiments, the amount of gas within the cable 120 is less that the predetermined<br>
amount of the volume of the cable 120 over a predefined distance. In some embodiments,<br>
the predetermined amount is ten percent.<br>
[00130] . By limiting the voids and the corresponding amount of a gas such as air within<br>
the cable 120 to less than the predetermined amount, the cable 120 has improved<br>
performance. The dielectrics about the twisted pairs 240 are made more consistent. As<br>
discussed above, this helps reduce the noise emitted from the twisted pairs 240.<br>
Consequently, the cables 120 are better able to accurately transmit high-speed data<br>
signals.<br>
[00131] Fig. 10 shows a cross-sectional view of an example of an alternative embodiment of a cable 120'". The cable 120'" of Fig. 10 shows a jacket 260'" even more<br>
tightly fitted around the twisted pairs 240. The cable 120'" illustrates that the jacket 260'"<br>
can be fitted around the cable 120'" in a number of different configurations that help<br>
minimize the voids able to retain a gas such as air within the cable 120'".<br>
H. Impedance Uniformity<br>
[00132] The reduction in the amount of air within the cable 120 as discussed above<br>
also helps maintain the integrity of propagating signals by niinimizing the impedance<br><br>
variations along the length of the cable 120. Specifically, the cable 120 can be configured<br>
such that its components are generally fixed in position within the jacket 260. The<br>
components within the jacket 260 can be generally fixed by reducing the amount of air<br>
within the jacket 260 in any of the ways discussed above. Specifically, the twisted pairs<br>
240 can be generally fixed in position with respect to one another. In some embodiments,<br>
the jacket 260 fits over the twisted pairs 240 in such a manner that it fixes the twisted<br>
pairs 240 in position. Typically, a compression fit is used, although it is not required. In<br>
other embodiments, a further material such as an adhesive may be used. In yet other<br>
embodiments, the filler 200 is configured to help generally fix the twisted pairs 240 in<br>
position. In some preferred embodiments, the components of the cable 120, including the<br>
twisted pairs 240, are firmly fixed in position with respect to one another.<br>
[00133] The cable 120, by having fixed physical characteristics,, is able to minimize<br>
impedance variations. As discussed above, any change in the physical characteristics or<br>
relations of the twisted pairs 240 is likely to result in an unwanted impedance variation.<br>
Because the cable 120 can include fixed physical attributes, the cable 120 can be<br>
manipulated, e.g., helically twisted, without introducing significant impedance deviations<br>
into the cable 120. The cable 120 can be helically twisted after it has been jacketed<br>
without introducing hazardous impedance deviations, including during manufacture,<br>
testing, and installation procedures. Accordingly, the cable lay length of the cable 120<br>
can be changed after it has been jacketed. In some embodiments, the physical distances<br>
between the twisted pairs 240 of the cable 120 do not change more than a predefined<br>
amount, even as the cable 120 is helically twisted. In some embodiments, the predefined<br>
amount is approximately 0.01 inches (0.254 mm).<br>
[00134] The generally locked physical characteristics of the cable 120 help to reduce<br>
attenuation due to signal reflections because less signal strength is reflected at any point<br>
of impedance variation along the cable 120. Thus, the cable 120 configurations facilitate<br>
the accurate and efficient propagations of high-speed data signals by minimizing changes<br>
to the physical characteristics of the cable 120 over its length.<br><br>
[00135] Further, materials with beneficial and consistent dielectric properties are used<br>
about the conductors 300 to help minimize impedance variations over the length of the<br>
cable 120. Any variation in physical attributes of the cable 120 over its length will<br>
enhance any existing capacitive unbalance of the twisted pair 240. The use of consistent<br>
dielectric materials reduces any capacitive biases within the twisted pairs 24..<br>
Consequently, any physical variation will enhance only minimized capacitive biases.<br>
Therefore, by using materials with consistent dielectrics proximate to the conductors 300,<br>
the effects of any physical variation in the cable 120 are minimized.<br>
I. Cable Lay Length Limitations<br>
[00136] The present cables 120 can be configured to reduce alien crosstalk by<br>
minimizing the occurrences of parallel cross-over points between adjacent cables 120. As<br>
mentioned above, parallel cross-over points between the twisted pairs 240 of the adjacent<br>
cables 120 are a significant source of alien crosstalk at high-speed data rates. The parallel<br>
points occur wherever twisted pairs 240 with identical or similar lay lengths are adjacent<br>
to each other. To minimize the parallel cross-over points between the adjacent cables<br>
120, the cables 120 can be twisted at dissimilar and/or varying lay lengths. When the<br>
cable 120 is helically twisted, the lay lengths of its twisted pairs 240 are changed<br>
according to the twisting of the cable 120. Therefore, the adjacent cables 120 can be<br>
helically twisted at dissimilar overall cable 120 lay lengths in order to differentiate the lay<br>
lengths of the twisted pairs 240 of one of the cables 120 from the lay lengths of the<br>
twisted pairs 240 of adjacent cables 120.<br>
[00137] For example, Fig. 11A shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of adjacent<br>
cables 120-1 according to the third embodiment of the invention. The adjacent cables<br>
120-1 shown in Fig. 11A include the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, 240d, and each<br>
twisted pair 240 having an initial predefined lay length. Assuming that neither of the<br>
cables 120-1 shown in Fig. 11A has been subjected to an overall helical twisting, the lay<br>
lengths of the twisted pairs 240 of the two cables 120-1 are the same. When the cables<br>
120-1 are positioned adjacent to one another, parallel cross-over points would exist<br><br>
between the corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120-1, e.g., the twisted pairs<br>
240d of each of the cables 120-1. The parallel twisted pairs 240 undesirably enhance the<br>
effects of alien crosstalk between the cables 120-1, especially as the cables 120-1 are<br>
susceptible to nesting.<br>
[00138] However, the lay lengths of the respective twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120-<br>
1 can be made dissimilar from each other at any cross-sectional point along a predefined<br>
length of the cables 120-1. By applying different overall torsional twist rates to each of<br>
the cables 120-1, the cables 120-1 become different, and the initial lay lengths of their<br>
respective twisted pairs 240 are changed to resultant lay lengths.<br>
[00139] For example, Fig. 11B shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the cables<br>
120-1 of Fig. 11A after they have been twisted at different overall twist rates. One of the<br>
twisted cables 120-1 is now referred to as the cable 120-1', while the other dissimilarly<br>
twisted cables 120-1 is now referred to as the cable 120-1". The cable 120-1' and the<br>
cable 120-1" are now differentiated by their different cable lay lengths and the different<br>
resultant lay lengths of their respective twisted pairs 240. The cable 120-1' includes the twisted pairs 240a', 240b', 240c', 240d' (collectively "the twisted pairs 240'"), which<br>
twisted pairs 240'. include their resultant lay lengths. The cable 120-1" includes the<br>
twisted pairs 240a", 240b", 240c", 240d" (collectively "the twisted pairs 240"") with their<br>
different resultant lay lengths.<br>
[00140] The effects of the overall twisting of the cables 120-1 can be further explained<br>
by way of numerical examples. In some embodiments, the adjusted, or resultant, lay<br>
lengths of the twisted pairs 240, measured in inches, may be approximately obtained by<br>
the following formula, where 'I' represents the original twisted pair 240 lay length, and<br>
"L" represents the cable lay length:<br><br><br>
[00141] Assume that a first of the cables 120-1 includes the twisted pair 240a with a<br>
predefined lay length of 0.30 inches (7.62 mm), the twisted pair 240c with a predefined<br>
lay length of 0.40 inches (10.16 mm), the twisted pair 240b with a predefined lay length<br>
of 0.50 inches (12.70 mm), and the twisted pair 240d with a predefined lay length of 0.60<br>
inches (15.24 mm). If the first cable 120-1 is twisted at an overall cable lay length of<br>
4.00 inches to become the cable 120-1', the predefined lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240<br>
are tightened as follows: the resultant lay length of the twisted pair 240a' becomes<br>
approximately 0.279 inches (7.087 mm), the resultant lay length of the twisted pair 240c'<br>
becomes approximately 0.364 inches (9.246), the resultant lay length of the twisted pair<br>
240b' becomes approximately 0.444 inches (11.278 mm), and the resultant lay length of<br>
the twisted pair 240d' becomes approximately 0.522 inches (13.259 mm).<br>
1. Minimum Cable Lay Variation<br>
[00142] The adjacent cables 120, such as the cables 120-1 in Fig. 11A, can be twisted<br>
randomly or non-randomly at dissimilar lay lengths, and the variation between their lay<br>
lengths can be limited within certain ranges in order to minimize the occurrences of<br>
parallel respective twisted pairs 240 between the cables 120. In the example above in<br>
which the first cable 120-1 is twisted at a lay length of 4.00 inches (101.6 mm) to become<br>
the cable 120-1', an adjacent second cable 120-1 can be twisted at a dissimilar overall lay<br>
length that varies at least a minimum amount from 4.00 inches (101.6 mm) so that the<br>
resultant lay lengths of its twisted pairs 240" are not too close to becoming parallel to the<br>
twisted pairs 240' of the cable 120-1'.<br>
[00143] For example, the second cable 120-1 shown in Fig. 11A can be twisted at a lay<br>
length of 3.00 inches (76.2 mm) to become the cable 120-1". At a 3.00 inch (76.2 mm)<br>
cable lay length for the cable 120-1", the resultant lay lengths of the cable's 120-1"<br>
twisted pairs become the following: 0.273 inches (6.934 mm) for the twisted pair 240a",<br>
0.353 inches (8.966 mm) for the twisted pair 240c", 0.429 inches (10.897) for the twisted<br>
pair 240b", and 0.500 inches (12.7 mm) for the twisted pair 240d". Greater variations<br>
between the cable lay lengths of adjacent cables 120-1', 120-1" result in increased<br><br>
dissimilarity between the lay lengths of the corresponding respective twisted pairs 240',<br>
240" of the cables 120-1', 120-1".<br>
[00144] Accordingly, the adjacent cables 120-1 shown in Fig. 11A should be twisted at<br>
unique lay lengths that are not too similar to each other's average cable lay lengths along<br>
at least a predefined distance, such as a ten meter cable 120 section. By having cable lay<br>
lengths that vary at least by a minimum variation, the corresponding twisted pairs 240 are<br>
configured to be non-parallel or to not come within a certain range of becoming parallel.<br>
As a result, alien crosstalk between the cables 120 is minimized because the<br>
corresponding twisted pairs 240 have dissimilar resultant lay lengths, while the<br>
corresponding twisted pairs .240 are maintained to not be too close to a parallel lay<br>
situation. In some embodiments, the cable lay lengths of the adjacent cables 120 vary no<br>
less than a predetermined amount of one another. In some embodiments, the adjacent<br>
cables 120 have individual cable lay lengths that vary no less than the predetermined<br>
amount from each other's average individual lay length calculated along at least a<br>
predefined distance of generally longitudinally extending section. In some embodiments,<br>
the predetermined amount is approximately plus or minus ten percent. In some<br>
embodiments, the predefined distance is approximately ten meters.<br>
2. Maximum Cable Lay Variation<br>
[00145] The adjacent cables 120, such as the cables 120-1', 120-1" shown in Fig. 11B,<br>
can be configured to minimize alien crosstalk by having unique cable lay lengths that do<br>
not vary beyond a certain maximum variation. By limiting the variation between the lay<br>
lengths of the adjacent cables 120-1', 120-1", the non-corresponding respective twisted<br>
pairs 240 of the cables 120-1', 120-1", e.g., the twisted pair 240b' of the cable 120-1' and<br>
the twisted pair 240d" of the cable 120-1", are prevented from becoming approximately<br>
parallel. In other words, the cable lay variation limit prevents the resultant lay length of<br>
the twisted pair 240d" of the cable 120-1" from becoming approximately equal to the<br>
resultant lay lengths of the cable 120-1' twisted pairs 240a", 240b", 240c". The lay length<br>
limitations can be configured so that each of the twisted pair 240' lay lengths of the cable<br><br>
120-1' equal no more than one of the twisted pair 240" lay lengths of the cable 120-1" at<br>
any cross-sectional point along the longitudinal axes of the cables 120-1', 120-1".<br>
[00146] Thus, the limit on maximum cable lay variation keeps the adjacent cables' 120<br>
individual twisted pair 240 lay lengths from varying too much. If one of the adjacent<br>
cables 120 were twisted too tightly compared to the twist rate of another cable 120, then<br>
non-corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the adjacent cables 120 may become<br>
approximately parallel, which would undesirably increase the effects of alien crosstalk<br>
between the adjacent cables 120.<br>
[00147] In the example given above in which the cable 120-1' included an overall<br>
cable lay length of 4.00 inches (101.6 mm), the cable 120-1" would be twisted too tightly<br>
if it were helically twisted at a cable lay length of approximately 1.71 inches (43.434<br>
mm). At a 1.71 inch (43.434 mm) lay length, the resultant lay lengths of the cable's 120-<br>
1" twisted pairs 240" become the following: 0.255 inches (6.477 mm) for the twisted pair<br>
240a", 0.324 inches (8.230 mm) for the twisted pair 240c", 0.287 inches (7.290 mm) for<br>
the twisted pair 240b", and 0.444 inches (11.278 mm) for the twisted pair 240d".<br>
Although the cables' 120-1', 120-1" corresponding twisted pairs 240', 240" now have a<br>
greater variation in their resultant lay lengths than they did when the cable 120-1" was<br>
twisted at 3.00 inches (76.2 mm), some of the non-corresponding twisted pairs 240', 240"<br>
of the cables 120-1', 120-1" have become approximately parallel. This increases alien<br>
crosstalk between the cables 120-1', 120-1". Specifically, the resultant lay length of the<br>
cable's 120-1' twisted pair 240b' approximately equals the resultant lay length of the<br>
cable's 120-1" twisted pair 240d".<br>
[00148] Therefore, the cables 120 should be helically twisted such that their individual<br>
twist rates do not cause the twisted pairs 240 between the cables 120 to become<br>
approximately parallel. This is especially important when overall cable lay lengths are<br>
gradually increased or decreased within the ranges specified, as parallel conditions could<br>
be evident at some point within the range. For example, the cable 120 lay lengths may be<br>
limited to ranges that do not cause their twisted pair 240 lay lengths to go beyond certain<br><br>
resultant lay length boundaries. By twisting the cables 120 only within certain ranges of<br>
cable lay lengths, non-corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 should not<br>
become approximately parallel. Therefore., the adjacent cables 120 can be configured<br>
such that the resultant lay length of one of the twisted pairs 240 equals no more than one<br>
resultant twisted pair 240 lay length of the other cable 120. For example, only the<br>
corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the cables 240 should ever have parallel lay lengths.<br>
In some embodiments, the twisted pair 240d of one of the adjacent cables 120 will not<br>
become parallel to the twisted pairs 240a, 24b, and 240c of another of the adjacent cables<br>
120.<br>
[00149] In some embodiments, the maximum variation boundaries for the cable lay<br>
length of the cables 120 is established according to maximum variation boundaries for<br>
each of the twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120. For example, assume a first cable 120<br>
includes the twisted pairs 240a, 240b, 240c, 240d with the following lay lengths: 0.30<br>
inches (7.62 mm)for the twisted pair 240a, 0.50 inches (12.7 mm) for the twisted pair<br>
• 240c, 0.70 inches (17.78 mm) for the twisted pair 240b, and 0.90 inches (22.86 mm) for<br>
the twisted pair 240d. The twist rate of the first cable 120 may be limited by certain<br>
maximum variation boundaries for the lay lengths of the twisted pairs 240 of the cable<br>
120.<br>
[00150] For example, in some embodiments, the lay length of the first cable 120<br>
should not cause the lay length of the twisted pair 240d to be less than 0.81 inches<br>
(20.574 mm). The resultant lay length of the twisted pair 240b should not become less<br>
than 0.61 inches (15.494 mm). The resultant lay length of the twisted pair 240c should<br>
not become less than 0.41 inches (10.414 mm). By limiting the lay lengths of the<br>
individual twisted pairs 240 to certain unique ranges, the non-corresponding twisted pairs<br>
240 of the adjacently positioned cables 120 should not become approximately parallel.<br>
Consequently, the effects of alien crosstalk are limited between the cables 120.<br>
[00151] Thus, the cables 120 can be configured to have cable lay lengths within certain<br>
minimum and maximum boundaries. Specifically, the cables 120 should each be twisted<br><br>
within a range bounded by a minimum variation and a maximum variation. The<br>
minimum variation boundary helps prevent the corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the<br>
cables 120 from being approximately parallel. The maximum variation boundary helps<br>
prevent the non-corresponding twisted pairs 240 of the cables 120 from becoming<br>
approximately parallel to each other, thereby reducing the effects of alien crosstalk<br>
- between the cables 120.<br>
3. Random Cable Twist<br>
[00152] As discussed above, the cable 120 can be randomly or non-randomly twisted<br>
along at least the predefined length. Not only does this encourage distance maximization<br>
between adjacent cables 120, it helps ensure that adjacently positioned cables 120 do not<br>
have twisted pairs 240 that are parallel to one another. At the least, the varying cable lay<br>
length of the cable 120 helps minimize the instances of parallel twisted pairs 240.<br>
Preferably, the cable lay length of the cable 120 varies over at least the predefined length,<br>
while remaining within the maximum and the minimum cable lay variation boundaries<br>
discussed above.<br>
[00153] The cable 120 can be helically twisted at a continuously increasing or<br>
continuously decreasing lay length so that the lay lengths of its twisted pairs are either<br>
continuously increased or continuously decreased over the predefined length such that<br>
when the predefined length of cables 120, or the twisted pairs 240, is separated into two<br>
sub-sections, and the sub-sections are positioned adjacent to one another, then at any<br>
point of adjacency for the sub-sections, the closest twisted pair 240 for each of the sub-<br>
sections have different lay lengths. This reduces alien crosstalk by ensuring that closest<br>
twisted pairs 240 between adjacent cables 120 have different lay lengths, i.e., are not<br>
parallel.<br>
[00154] When the cable 120 undergoes an overall twisting, a torsional twist rate is<br>
applied uniformly to the twisted pairs 240 at any particular point along the predefined<br>
length. However, because the initial lay length is a factor in the equation discussed<br><br>
above, the change from the initial lay length to the resultant lay length of each of the<br>
twisted pairs 240 will be slightly different. Fig. 1 shows two adjacent cables 120 that are<br>
individually twisted at different lay lengths.<br>
[00155] Fig. 12 shows a chart of a variation of twist rate applied to the cable 120<br>
according to one embodiment. The horizontal axis represents a length of the cable 120,<br>
separated into predefined lengths. The vertical axis represents the tightness of overall<br>
cable 120 twist. As shown in Fig. 12, the twist rate is continuously increased over a<br>
certain length (v) of the cable 120, preferably over the predefined length. At the end of<br>
the certain length (1v), the twist rate quickly returns to a looser twist rate and continuously increases for at least the next predefined length (2v). This twist pattern<br>
forms the saw-tooth chart shown in Fig. 12. By varying the twist rate as shown in Fig.<br>
12, any section of the cable 120 along the predefined length can be separated into<br>
sections, which sections do not share an identical twist rate.<br>
[00156] The cable lay length should be varied at least over the predefined length.<br>
Preferably, the predefined length equals at least approximately the length of one<br>
fundamental wavelength of a signal being transmitted over the cable 120. This gives the<br>
fundamental wavelength enough length to complete a full cycle. The length of the<br>
fundamental wavelength is dependent upon the frequency of the signal being transmitted.<br>
In some exemplary embodiments, the length of the fundamental wavelength is<br>
approximately three meters. Further, it is well known that events of a cyclical nature are<br>
additive, and multiple wavelengths are needed to see if cyclical issues exist. However, by<br>
insuring some form of randomness over a one to three wavelength distance, cyclical<br>
issues can be minimized or even potentially eliminated. In some embodiments,<br>
inspection of longer wavelengths is needed to insure randomness.<br>
[00157] Thus, in some embodiments, the predefined length is at least approximately<br>
the length of one fundamental wavelength but no more than approximately the length of<br>
three fundamental wavelengths of a signal being transmitted. Therefore, in some<br><br>
embodiments, the predefined length is approximately three meters. In other<br>
embodiments, the predefined length is approximately ten meters.<br>
J. Performance Measurements<br>
[00158] In some embodiments, the cables 120 can propagate data at throughputs<br>
approaching and surpassing 20 gigabits per second. In some embodiments, the Shannon<br>
capacity of one-hundred meter length cable 120 is greater than approximately 20 gigabits<br>
per second without the performance of any alien crosstalk mitigation with digital signal<br>
processing.<br>
[00159] For example, in one embodiment, the cabled group 100 comprises seven<br>
cables 120 positioned longitudinally adjacent to each other over approximately a one-<br>
hundred meter length. The cables 120 are arranged such that one centrally positioned<br>
cable 120 is surrounded by the other six cables 120. In this configuration, the cables 120<br>
can transmit high-speed data signals at rates approaching and surpassing 20 gigabits per<br>
second.<br>
