				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to incendiary compositions and more particularly to incendiary compositions made from zirconium metal powder<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Incendiary compositions are chemical agents, which, when suitably initiated, evolve large amount of heat. Incendiary devices are used to initiate destructive fires in a variety of combustible targets like fuel and ammunition dumps, clothing, industrial installations, base camps, refineries etc. Incendiary devices can be in the form of gun projectiles, bombs, warheads, or clusters of ammunition. These devices can be delivered to the targets by guns, rockets, missiles or aircraft. The tactical use of such devices is to create a psychological fear of mass destruction by creating fire amongst troops during operations, The efficiency of the incendiary composition depends on the total heat output, duration of burning, spread area, flame temperature, rate of transfer of heat energy to the target etc. Ignition and dispersion of incendiary compositions may be achieved by using centrally placed HE bursting charge to scatter the flammable burning mass.<br>
Incendiary compositions can be broadly classified into following categories: (a) Liquids (b) Gels and (c) Solids.<br>
Liquids incendiary compositions comprise of hydrocarbons like benzene, gasoline, toluene etc. or pyrophoric organic chemicals like triethyl aluminium, diethyl zinc etc. These compositions have short storage life and low temperature out put. These are hazardous in nature, difficult to handle and are not suitable for use with spinning type of projectiles. The notable gel type incendiary compositions are Napalm based incendiaries. The physical nature and performance characteristics of the liquids are improved by converting them into high viscosity gels by the addition of thickening agents. These gel type incendiary compositions, though effective, are suitable only for non-spinning type of projectiles like bombs, rockets or mortars.<br>
Solid incendiary compositions overcome the major defects associated with liquid and gel incendiaries, especially in terms of shelf life, temperature output and suitability for application in spinning projectiles. They can be further classified as thermites, pyrophoric compositions and high explosive incendiary compositions. Thermites, also termed pyrotechnic incendiaries, are essentially mixtures of oxidiser and fuel in desired proportion and need a special ignition system for their reliable ignition. They generate a very high temperature, and dispersion is limited to ejection in only one direction. Pyrophoric metal powders/alloys like zirconium, titanium magnalium are used as incendiaries. They are bound in polymeric material to reduce their sensitivity and can be initiated and dispersed over the desired area by a pyrotechnic chain or a bursting HE charge. The latter method covers a wide area. . The burning fragments generate high heat and burn for sufficiently long duration to set on fire any combustible items they may come in contact with. Other pyrophoric elements are phosphorus, sodium, potassium, etc.<br>
Phosphrous produces more smoke and less heat, while sodium and potassium are difficult to ignite in dry conditions. They require special conditions during storage and use. Another class of incendiaries termed high explosive incendiaries contain metal powders like aluminium, magnesium, zirconium etc. in the matrix of RDX/TNT or TNT or RDX/Wax etc. These compositions produce fire-balls of limited size and rnrlli-second duration.<br>
The present invention relates to a high explosive incendiary composition, which utilises zirconium metal powder. The incendiary compositions, which utilise zirconium metal powder, are known in the art. However, these incendiary compositions, utilising zirconium metal powder, suffer from various disadvantages.<br>
For example, an incendiary composition comprising zirconium or hafnium metallic sponge particles and organic binder Teflon, is already known in the art. However, this incendiary composition suffers from the disadvantage that this is prone to ignition and explosion during compaction of zirconium or hafnium metallic sponge particles due to the adiabatic compression of air in fissures between the surfaces.<br>
Another incendiary composition, comprising zirconium or titanium metal powder and an organic binder free from halogen is known in the art. In this incendiary composition, already known in the art, the binder is mixed with the metal powder in a conventional manner. This incendiary composition also suffers from the following disadvantages.<br>
Primary disadvantage of this incendiary composition, already known in the art, is that the coating of the binder over the metal powder is not uniform, thereby affecting the crucial mechanical properties of this incendiary composition.<br>
Another disadvantage of this incendiary composition, already known in the art, is that it has low burning duration due to the large surface area of the metal powder.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which comprises zirconium metal powder dispersed in the matrix of a binder such as natural rubber.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which utilises a relatively an insensitive material rubber as a binder material thereby improving the safety during the handling of the composition.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which has higher flame temperature and higher rate of transfer of heat energy to the target.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which is capable of spreading over a wide area in a burning state igniting combustible materials that it contacts.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which are suitable for spinning as well as non-spinning munitions.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which utilizes the binder material as a fuel.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which has a shelf life of more than 10 years in assembled and packed condition under tropical conditions.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, wherein the zirconium powder is dispersed in the binder material thereby reducing the pyrophorocity of the zirconium metal powder and as such making the handling of the incendiary composition safer.<br>
Yet further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which can be compacted or pressed in suitably die punch assemblies to obtain pellets of required configuration.<br>
Still further object of the invention is to provide an incendiary composition and a process for the preparation thereof, which also comprises anti-oxidant and anti-fungal ingredients.<br>
