The serrated curved blade or knife is made of leaf spring of 6 mm thickness and is 45cm in length. These serrated points help applying a concentrated load on the husk.

This will not allow the knife to come down unless it is required. To cut open the tender coconut is placed on the base such that its longitudinal axis is radial to the stand. The knife is lifted and placed on the coconut. It is then pressed down with a downward thrust splitting the coconut into two halves. If the shell is hard, the hand liver is lifted to its upper limit on the blade and suddenly swung downward imparting an impact force which normally cuts open the coconut. It is observed that the time needed for cutting open a tender coconut is 2-3 seconds. This method is much safer than the traditional method because the blade movement is through a controlled path and at a controlled speed. In normal operation no part of the body comes in the way of the blade. No special skill is required for operating it and hence is an ideal tool for &#x27;Tender Coconut Parlors&#x27;.

				<td>3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
(i) Tender Coconut Punch<br>
A simple tender nut punch has been developed. It mainly consists of a square base made of MS angle of 40 cm length. The tender nut is placed on the nut holder which is a circular and hollow in shape with a diameter of 10 cm. The tender nut can be placed on the nut holder and by operating the lever mechanism a hole of 12mm diameter is made in just 4-5 seconds. As the lever is spring loaded it automatically tries to move upwards. At this point one has to hold the nut so that the lever moves up. The waste removing rod is pushed down thus removing the waste from inside the punch. A straw is put in the hole and one can drink the nut water (Fig. 1). This device is operated manually by one person. The punching of coconut can be done irrespective of size and the withdrawal of punch after punching is made easier and quicker by this invention as there are no complicated parts. This device can be operated by any person including women there by reducing the<br><br>
drudgery involved. Chances of injury are almost eliminated. This specific advantage is likely to encourage women also to establish Tender nut parlors.<br>
(ii) Tender Coconut Cutter<br>
A simple Tender Coconut Cutter was developed. It mainly consists a wooden base of 50 cm length, a stand, a knife and a hand lever. The stand is mounted on the base. The cutting blade is mounted concentric to the stand and retained at a height of 15-20 cm. Provision also exists for changing the position of the knife to other convenient heights depending upon the size of coconut. The serrated curved blade or knife is made of leaf spring of 6 mm thickness and is 45cm in length. These serrated points help applying a concentrated load on the husk. One end of the blade is attached the swiveling head through a horizontal hinge to enable the blade to be operated in a vertical plane. The hand lever is pivoted to the other end of the blade through a horizontal hinge. One stopper or limits provided on the lower side to apply concentrated load for easy cutting. Once the cutting operation is complete the knife is taken upwards and hooked to a lock. This will not allow the knife to come down unless it is necessary (Fig.2.)<br>
To cut open the tender coconut is placed on the base such that its longitudinal axis is radial to the stand. The knife is lifted and placed on the coconut. It is then pressed down with a downward thrust splitting the coconut into two halves. If the shell is hard, the hand liver is lifted to its upper limit on the blade and suddenly swung downward imparting an impact force which normally cuts open the coconut. It is observed that the time needed for cutting open a tender coconut is 2-3 seconds. This method is much safer than the traditional method because the blade movement is through a controlled path and at a controlled speed. In normal operation no part of the body comes in the way of the blade. No special skill is required for operating it and hence is an ideal tool for 'Tender Coconut Parlors'. Even women can operate without fear of injury.<br><br>
4. DESCRIPTION<br>
(i) Tender Coconut Punch<br>
A simple tender nut punch has been developed. It mainly consists of a square base<br>
made of MS angle of 40 cm length. A cylindrical shaft of length 90 cm is welded perpendicular to the base stand on one end. The diameter of the shaft is 30mm. The shaft holds two bushes separated apart which are joined using MS pipe. On this pipe a hollow stainless steel pipe of 12mm is fixed. The hollow pipe is provided with a stainless steel rod for removing the cut husk which moves inside the rod when the punch moves down. The movable bush mechanism is attached to a operating lever which in turn is also fixed to the main shaft. The lever attachment has provision to be fixed at any desired height depending on the size of the nuts. One of the bush and the lever mechanism is fixed with a spring.<br>
The tender nut is placed on the nut holder which is a circular and hollow in shape with a diameter of 10 cm. The tender nut can be placed on the nut holder and by operating the lever mechanism a hole of 12mm diameter is made in just 4-5 seconds. As the lever is spring loaded it automatically tries to move upwards. At this point one has to hold the nut so that the lever moves up. The waste removing rod is pushed down thus removing the waste from inside the punch. A straw is put in the hole and one can drink the nut water.<br>
(Fig. 1)<br>
This device is operated manually by one person. The punching of coconut can be done irrespective of size and the withdrawal of punch after punching is made easier and quicker by this invention as there are no complicated parts. The number of unit operations is also reduced to only one. Above all, it makes the operation safer because the punching method eliminates the need for removing the husk with the machete which otherwise is needed in the traditional method requiring skilled person. This device can be operated by any person including women there by reducing the drudgery involved. Chances of injury<br><br>
are almost eliminated. This specific advantage is likely to encourage women also to establish 'Tender nut parlours or Elaneer Pandals(ii) Tender Coconut Cutter<br>
