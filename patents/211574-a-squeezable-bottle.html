A SQUEEZE BOTTLE DISPENSER<br>
The invention relates to a squeeze bottle and dispenser, particularly those which are used for dispensing aqueous or other liquid compositions.<br>
Increasing environmental concerns over the use of aerosolized products, particularly those aerosolized products which include chlorofluorocarbon propellants suspected of being harmful to the ozone layer has prompted the interest in the use of alternative dispensing systems. One such alternative dispensing system which is both economical and satisfactory for the dispensing of aqueous or other liquid compositions, are squeeze-type bottles. Typically, these squeeze-type bottles include a flexible flask or bottle portion which is intended to be compressed by the consumer, and which contains a liquid composition. Upon compression of this flask or bottle portion, the liquid composition is forced up a dip tube which extends downwardly from a dispensing cap, and thereafter is dispensed through the dispensing cap. Liquid compositions which may be dispensed include for example, cleaning compositions as well as medical compositions.<br>
Exemplary squeeze-type bottles include, for example, those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,014,467 to Silverman, as well as in U.S. Patent No. 5,301,846 to Schmitz.<br>
A shortcoming attendant upon the use of such squeeze-type bottles lies in the fact that typically, not all of the liquid composition provided to a consumer is dispensed in a uniform manner. This is particularly true when the level of the liquid composition contained within the bottle falls to below half, and particularly falls to below one-quarter of the fluid volume which was originally provided Thus, when the squeeze-type bottle contains a full amount of the composition, squeezing of the flexible bottle portion generally provides a very satisfactory spraying pattern exiting from the dispensing cap. However, as the liquid composition is exhausted, and the non-liquid volume of the bottle (air space) grows, subsequent dispensing of the liquid composition by the consumer usually provides a weak stream, and/or very poor spray pattern exiting the dispensing cap. Naturally, such is disadvantageous from both a technical and from a consumer standpoint From a technical standpoint, the loss of<br><br>
the initial, satisfactory spray pattern results in a loss of area covered when the product is dispensed. This forces the consumer to dispense more of the product in order to provide more uniform coverage over a given area. From a consumer standpoint, this may lead to dissatisfaction with the product, as it appears that the squeeze bottle is defective. Further, the consumer is also forced to dispense a greater amount of the liquid composition in order to ensure uniform coverage of an area, due to the loss or degradation of spraying patterns.<br>
The present invention addresses and overcomes these technical shortcomings. Accordingly, in one aspect of the invention there is provided a squeeze botde for dispensing a liquid composition, particularly a household cleaning and/or sanitizing composition which squeeze botde includes a dispensing cap having a configuration providing for the improved delivery of the said liquid composition.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a dispensing cap suitable for use with a squeeze bottle which dispensing cap provides an improved spray pattern notwithstanding the level of the liquid contained within the squeeze bottle.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for improving the spray delivery characteristics of squeeze-type bottles which comprise the steps of: providing an improved dispensing cap having a configuration suited to provide an improved and more consistent spray pattern to a liquid composition exiting the bottle, notwithstanding the level of the liquid composition remaining in the squeeze botde.<br>
Other aspects of the invention become more apparent from the reading of the following specification.<br>

It is to be understood that like reference numerals are used throughout the following specification and in the accompanying figures in order to refer to like elements.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a squeeze bottle generally depicted as (10) on Fig. 1. The squeeze bottle includes at least one deformable sidewall (12) terminating at one end a bottom wall (14) and which terminates at another end in a neck (16) through which a liquid composition may enter the interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle(10). A quantity of a liquid composition (20) is also depicted in Fig. 1. The neck (16) forms a liquid-tight seal in conjunction with a dispensing cap (22) through which the liquid composition (20) is dispensed.<br>
With regards to the squeeze bottle (10), the dispensing cap (22) and the dip tube (40), these can be made of any material which is flexible, and which is sufficiently chemically resistant so that it is not undesirably degraded by containing the liquid composition (20) over reasonably long periods of time, i.e., several weeks, several months as well as longer. For example, particularly advantageous materials which can be used to produce the squeeze bottle (10) include various polymers, including but not limited to: polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene,<br><br>
polybutylene; poiyamides including various grades of nylons, especially Nylon 6 and Nylon 66; polyalkylene terephalates such as polyethylene terephalates and polybutylene terephalates, as well as mixtures or blends of such polymers. Other materials of construction useful for the formation of flexible bottles which are currently known to the art can also be used and enjoy the benefits of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Turning now to the dispensing cap (22), the dispensing cap (22) includes a nozzle head portion (24) which extends upwardly from a flange (26). The nozzle head portion (24) also includes incorporated therein a discharge orifice (28). Extending downwardly from the flange (26) is an outer circumferential skirt (30) which is proportioned so to engage the outer wall (31) of the neck (16) of the squeeze bottle (10)- The outer circumferential skirt (30) and the neck (16) may be engaged by any suitable engagement means, including but not limited to mating threads on both the outer circumferential skirt (30) and the neck (16), or any other suitable means. The dispensing cap (22) also includes an inner circumferential skirt (34) extending downwardly from the flange (26). The inner circumferential skirt .  (34) which has an outer wall (36) which is so proportioned to engage the inner wall (32) of the neck (16) of the squeeze bottle (10). Desirably, a liquid tight seal is provided by the juncture of portions of the dispensing cap (22) and the neck (16) of the squeeze bottle (10). The dispensing cap (22) also includes a boss (38) extending downwardly from the flange (26) towards the interior of the squeeze bottle (10). The boss (38) also extends upwardly beyond the flange (26) and forms a portion of the nozzle head portion (24) of the dispensing cap (22). A portion of the boss (38) is dimensioned to hold a portion of a dip tube (40). The dip tube (40) includes a proximal end portion (42) which is inserted into and retained by the boss (38), as well as a distal end portion (44) which extends downwardly within the interior of the squeeze bottle and terminates near the bottom wall (14) thereof. The boss (38) has included in its construction an air flow channel (46), which will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In operation, a consumer grasps the squeeze botde (10) about the sidewall (12) thereof and compresses the sidewall (12). This induoes the flow of the liquid composition (20) into the distal end portion 
 <br>
exerted upon the sidewal] (12) of the squeeze bottle (10) induces the flow towards and past the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube. The liquid exiting from the proximal end portion of the dip tube enters a mixing chamber (50) located just beyond the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40). At the same time, any air within the interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle (10) is simultaneously also forced into the air flow channel (46) wherein it mixes in the mixing chamber (50) with the liquid composition (20) exiting the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40), and forces both the liquid composition and the air to exit via the discharge orifice (28) most desirably in the fonn of a spray pattern of droplets.<br>
The dispensing cap according to the invention provides superior deliveiy characteristics of the liquid composition (20) due to the specific construction of the dispensing caps (22) and the portions integral thereto.<br>
Turning now to Fig. A, there is depicted a cross section along reference lines R-R of Fig. 1 of a portion of a conventional dispensing cap according to the prior art As shown in Fig A., there is provided a nozzle head portion (24A) and a portion of a dip tube (40A), Also shown in the figure are three buttresses, buttress (B1), buttress (B2) and buttress (B3). These three buttresses are integrally formed as part of the nozzle head portion (24A) and extend radially inwardly. Each of these buttresses include an end portion, which contact and retain the outer wall (52) of the dip tube (40A). The dip tube (40A) is physically frictionally fitted between the respective end portions of the buttresses, specifically between the end portion (El) of buttress (Bl), end portion (E2) of buttress (B2) and end portion <e3 of buttress it is to be understood that each these buttresses have a height which-cannot seen as extending upwardly and downwardly from the plane paper upon which figure drawn. whose length approximately equal or may less than portion proximal end dip tube inserted within boss more easily when viewing fig. l></e3>
As will be understood from Fig. A, the-spaces between exterior wall (52) of the dip tube (40A) and the nozzle head portion(24A) between the spaces occupied by the buttresses (Bl), (B2) and (B3) define channels (A1),<a2 and as shown on fig. a these channels provide lor the bidirectional flow of air from exterior></a2><br>
environment into the interior volume of the squeeze bottle (10), Such an arrangement of dip tube and dispensing cap (22), however, is disadvantageous in that poor delivery characteristics result especially when the liquid composition {20) contained within the squeeze bottle (10) is less than half, particularly less than 25% of the total available interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle (10). With the use of such prior art dispensing cap having an arrangement of a nozzle head portion as depicted on Fig. A, when the squeeze bottle (10) is compressed, a substantial amount of air is compressed within the interior volume (18) and is quickly expelled through the channels (Al), (A2) and (A3). This allows for the more rapid compression of the bottle, but simultaneously diminishes the flow of the liquid composition (20) which is induced flow up the dip tube (40) and exit the dispensing cap (22). Additionally, the. likelihood of forming a desirable spray pattern of the liquid exiting the dispensing cap (22) through the discharge orifice is also substantially reduced in that as the large volume of air rushes out of the discharge orifice (28), only a minor proportion acts to mix with the liquid composition (20) within the mixing chamber (50) and form a desirable spray pattern.<br>
The dispensing caps according to the present invention overcome many, if not all, of these technical shortcomings attendant upon the use of the prior art caps, particularly those which comport with the structure illustrated on Fig. A,<br>
Turning to Fig. 2, there is provided a cross-sectional view of a nozzle head portion (24) according to a first embodiment of the invention. This cross-sectional view corresponds to line R-R as shown on Figs. 1, and particularly with reference to Figs 5 and 6. As is shown in Fig. 2, the nozzle head portion (24) has a bore (55) within which is fitted the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40). The nozzle head portion (24) is also interrupted by a rectangularly-shaped air flow channel 
 <br>
(46) is bounded on three sides by the material which is used to form the nozzle head portion (24) thereof, but has one open end (54) which, however, is sealed when the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40) is inserted into the nozzle head portion (24), As can be seen from similar inspection in comparing the cross section of the nozzle head portion (24) according to the invention without its prior art (shown in Fig. A) the cross-sectional area of the air flow channel (46) is substantially less than the cross-sectional area of the air passages (Al), (A2) and (A3). The present inventors have surprisingly found that the spray characteristics and the delivery characteristics are substantially improved when the cross-sectional area of the air flow channel (56) is not greater than the cross-sectional area of the interior of the dip tube (58). Preferred, in fact, that the cross-sectional area of the air flow channel (56) be less than 80% of the cross-sectional area of the open portion of the dip tube (58), more preferably, less than 50%, yet more preferably is less than 30% of the area of the cross-sectional area of the open part of the dip tube (58). It is to be understood that there need be an air flow channel comprised of one or more air passages, each of which passages admits for the passage of air therethrough.<br>
The inventors have discovered that surprisingly, a substantial reduction in the amount of air which is allowed to exit the squeeze bottle (10) when it is compressed has a dual benefit First, a reduction in the volume of air which is allowed to exit when the squeeze bottle is compressed ensures that the pressure built up in the interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle (10) acts to increase the pressure upon the liquid composition (20) contained within the squeeze bottle and more effectively force it upward through the dip tube (40). This is particularly important when the liquid composition (20) occupies 50%, or particularly 25% or less, of the available interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle. Thus, most if not all of the total amount of the liquid composition (20) can be expelled from the squeeze bottle and put to the purpose for which it is intended (cleaning, sanitizing, deodorizing, etc.). Surprisingly also it was observed that with the reduction of the amount of air exiting the bottle via the dispensing cap {22), a substantial increase in the velocity of the air exiting the interior volume (18) through the air flow channel (46) greatly improves the mixing characteristics within the mixing chamber (50) and consequently improves the spray pattern of the liquid composition being dispensed. This was<br><br>
surprising as it was observed that such a desirable spray pattern was substantially maintained both when the liquid composition (20) occupied most of the available interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle (10) as well as when the liquid composition (20) occupied only a minor proportion of the interior volume (18) of the squeeze bottle (10). Such spray performance characteristics over the useful life of the dispensing package satisfied both the technical and consumer benefits described above. Namely, according to particular preferred embodiments of the dispensing caps according to the invention, spray bottles containing a liquid composition provided a fairly uniform and satisfactory spray delivery pattern over the useful life of the dispensing package and the product contained therein. Such has not been possible with the dispensing caps, or spray bottle dispensing packages known to this<br>
time.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 3, there is provided an alternative embodiment of a portion of a dispensing cap according to the present invention. Depicted on Fig. 3 is again a cross-sectional view of a nozzle head portion (24) taken along reference lines R-R as is generally shown in Figs. 1, and especially in Figs. 5 and 6, The nozzle head portion (24) includes a bore (55) within which is fitted the proximal end portion of the dip tube (40), but which includes two air flow channels (46). As discussed with reference to Fig.2, such air flow channels (46) have a height dimension which can be as little as approximately 1 millimeter, or which can extend as long as the length of the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40), or even longer. As in Fig. 2, the air flow channels (46) in Fig. 3 have a cross-sectional area (56) and each have open ends (54) which contact the outer wall (52) of the dip tube (40) and again, the interior of the dip tube (50) also has a cross-sectional area (58). As opposed to the embodiment shown in Fig. 2, as the embodiment in Fig. 3 which includes two air flow channels it is to be understood that the total of the cross-sectional areas (56) of the two air flow channels (46) are to be equal to, but desirably less than the total cross-sectional area of the interior (58) of the dip tube (40). Desirably, the total of these cross-sectional areas (56) are less than 80% of the cross-sectional area of the interior of the dip tube (58), more desirably are less than 50%, yet more desirably are less than 30% of the area of the cross-sc^tional area of the interior (58) of dip tube (40). The embodiment according to Fig. 3 provides the further advantage in that two<br><br>
air flow channels are provided, which provides increased turbulence in the mixing chamber (50) of the dispensing cap (22) according to the invention. Such increased turbulence improves the foaming characteristics of a liquid composition, which may be particularly desirable if intended. Such increased turbulence improves the spray pattern of a liquid composition (20) being dispensed via the dispensing cap (22) as<br>
well.<br>
Attention is also to be directed to the fact that in both Figs. 2 and 3, the air flow channels (46) are rectangular and according to these two preferred embodiments, the geometries of the air flow channels are selected to provide sharp edges. That is to say, as the squeeze bottle is compressed, the air being pressurized within the interior volxime (18) of the squeeze bottle (10) above the level of the liquid composition (20) encounters the sharp lower edge (not shown) of the nozzle head portion (24) and thus there is increased likelihood that turbulent air flow will be induced. Again, such turbulent air flow is believed to improve the efficacy of the mixing occurring in the mixing chamber (50) of the dispensing cap (22). Also, such a rectangular cross-sectional configuration for the air flow channels (46) as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 also provide for a small degree of compressibility which aids in the insertion of the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40) which is inserted into the boss (38) of the dispensing cap (22).<br>
Turning now to Fig. 4 therein is depicted a further embodiment of a nozzle head portion (24) according to the invention. Therein is depicted a nozzle head portion (24) having an air flow channel (46), here, however, in the shape of a circular bore which extends parallel to the bore (55) within which the dip tube (40) is positioned. As with the prior embodiments illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, the cross-sectional area of the air flow channel (46) in the embodiment of Fig. 4, is desirably not greater than the cross-sectional area of the dip tube (58). Yet more desirably, the cross-sectional area of the air flow channel (46) is not more than 80%, still more preferably not more than 50%, but most preferably are not more than 30% of the cross-sectional interior of the dip tube {58). However, unlike the embodiments shown on Figs. 2 and 3, no portion of the air flow channel (46) contacts the bore or the dip tube (40) contained within the bore.<br><br>
Whereas, it has been shown in Figs. 2 and 3 that one wall of the air flow channel (46) is formed by the exterior wall of the dip tube (52), such, however, is not a limitation, but is a matter of convenience in facilitating the insertion of the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40). As noted previously, the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40) is conveniently retained in the boss (38) by a friction fit, although other means may also be used. The intersection of the air flow cannel (46) with the bore (55) within which the dip tube (40) is to be fitted allows for the slight expansion of the bore (55) when the dip tube (40) is inserted, should such be necessary.<br>
Turning now to Fig. 5, there is shown a cross-sectional view of a preferred embodiment of the dispensing cap (22) mounted upon the neck (16) of a squeeze bottle (10). According to this embodiment, the neck (16) includes two or more outwardly extending ledges (60) which cooperate with similarly configured recesses (62) extending into the outer circumferential skirt (30) of the dispensing cap (22). For convenience in the assembly of the dispensing cap (22) with the squeeze bottle (10) the inner bottom periphery (64) of the outer circumferential skirt (30) is provided with a chamfer or fillet As may also be seen in Fig. 5, the inner circumferential skirt (34) is configured also to provide a close tolerance fit with the neck (16). Desirably, the juncture between the inner circumferential skirt (34), the flange (26) and at least a part of the outer circumferential skirt (34) provides a liquid tight, or more preferably a hermetic seal with the neck (16).<br>
It is to be understood that while ledges (60) and-corresponding recesses (62) are depicted on Fig. 5, that any other means for attaching the dispensing cap (22) to the squeeze bottle, particularly at the neck (16) thereof, may be used, with the proviso only that a liquid tight seal is formed between the dispensing cap 
 <br>
dispensing cap (22) and the neck (16) be sufficiently close such that mere friction fitting of these elements will provide a liquid tight seal therebetween.<br>
To aid in the placement of the dispensing cap (22) upon the squeeze bottle (10), especially the neck (16) thereof, the bottom outer wall (36) of the inner circumferential skirt (34) may also be provided with a chamfer or a fillet (37).<br>
As is shown in Fig, 5, the dip tube (40) is inserted and retained by the boss (38) and is so positioned that its proximal end portion (42) extends upwardly and beyond the flange within the interior of the nozzle head portion (24). As is also seen in Fig. 5, the air flow channel (46), here to be understood to be an air flow channel of having a generally rectangular cross section and -corresponding to that depicted on Fig, 2 is also shown. As can be seen, the air flow channel (46) forms a recess in the boss (38) and extends in a direction parallel to the axis of the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40) inserted into the boss (38). In this Figure, the air flow channel (46) has one end (54) near one end of the boss (38) and the air flow channel (46) extends upwardly beyond the proximal end of the dip tube and into the mixing chamber (50). The air flow channel (46) has one side formed by the outside wall (52) of the dip tube (40), while its other sides are integrally formed as part of the dispensing cap (22).<br>
The embodiment of the dispensing cap (22) illustrated on Fig. 5 also includes a sealing cap portion (66) which is flexibly attached to a portion of the dispensing cap (22) by means of a hinge (68). The hinge 
 <br>
outwardly from the flange (26) in the same direction as the nozzle head portion (24). Desirably, the upper circumferential skirt (76) is dimensioned to engage and to form a friction fit between itself and at least a portion of the outer circumferential cap wall (72). Again, according to the embodiment depicted on Fig. 5, the cap plate (70) is provided with an inner circumferential cap wall (74) which is desirably dimensioned so that a friction fit is formed between at least a portion of the inner circumferential cap wall (74) and at least a portion of the nozzle head portion (24) of the dispensing cap (22) when the sealing cap (66) is rotated and closed upon the sealing cap (22). According to this embodiment, the nozzle head portion (24) extending upwardly from the flange (26) is engaged within a nozzle head cavity (7S). According to particular preferred embodiments, the dimensions of the inner circumferential cap wall (74) and the dimensions of the nozzle head portion (24) are selected such that a friction fit, desirably a liquid tight seal, is formed when the sealing cap (66) is engaged upon the dispensing cap (22). Such provides a substantial likelihood in the loss of the liquid composition contained within the squeeze bottle (10).<br>
To facilitate the opening of the cap plate (70), a push tab (80) is provided at least one edge of the outer circumferential cap wall (72). The push tab (80) facilitates for the gripping of the cap plate (70) and its removal from the dispensing<br>
cap (22).<br>
Turning now to Fig. 6, there is depicted a still further embodiment of the invention which shares elements common to that of Fig. 5. These are indicated on Fig. 6. According to the embodiment depicted in Fig. 6, there is depicted a "plug-type" dispensing cap which include an inner circumferential skirt (34) which is dimensioned so to provide a liquid tight, friction fit between the outer wall (36) of the inner circumferential skirt (34), and with the neck (16) of the squeeze bottle (10).<br>
While the embodiments of Figs. 5 and 6 have illustrated a "flip-type" cap, it is also contemplated that other cap-type constructions can be used in-conjunction with the improved dispensing caps according to the present invention. These, of course, include removable, suitably -configured caps which include a circumferential skirt having mating threads (not shown), but which.would be adapted to engage the cap threads (82) illustrated on Fig. 1.<br><br>
Turning now to Fig. 7, there is depicted a frontal view of a nozzle head portion (24) of a dispensing cap according to the invention which provides improved foaming properties to liquid compositions being dispensed therefrom. According to this embodiment, the discharge orifice (28) is comprised of a plurality of small, straight-edged orifices, here depicted as four square-shaped orifices of approximately equal size and distributed in an even row.<br>
Similarly, on Fig. 8 is depicted a frontal view of a further embodiment of a nozzle head portion (24) of an improved dispensing cap (22) according to the invention wherein, however, the discharge orifice is comprised of four individual, generally circular, orifices arranged in a group or a cluster. According to the embodiments illustrated in Fig. 7 and in Fig. 8, the discharge orifice (28) greatly facilitates in inducing foaming of a liquid composition which is intended to provide such an effect. Such discharge orifices (28) act to break up and to distribute the stream of composition exiting the mixing chamber (50) of the nozzle head portion (24). Their judicious sizing, as well as placement, may also be used in aiding the direction of flow leaving the dispensing cap. For instance, as is shown in Fig. 7, the four individual square-shaped orifices arranged in a row will provide a generally planar or linear delivery pattern of the composition being dispensed. In the alternative, the discharge orifices (28) as illustrated on Fig. 8 comprised of individual circular orifices arranged in a cluster or group will tend to provide a more circular delivery pattern of the composition being dispensed from the dispensing cap (22).<br>
With respect now to Fig. 9, therein is illustrated a cross-sectional view of a further embodiment of a dispensing cap according to the present invention. This embodiment is of the "plug-type" and shares many of the common features of the embodiment illustrated on Fig.6. With respect to Fig. 9, therein is also illustrated a recess (84) which is integral to the interior surface (86) of the mixing chamber (50). The recess (84) desirably has a portion which extends from the air flow channel (46) and thereafter extends toward the discharge orifice 
 <br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a cross-sectional view in detail of a dispensing cap (22) according to the present invention, and which corresponds to the embodiment illustrated on Fig. 9. Depicted on Fig. 9 is again a cross-sectional view of a nozzle head portion (24) taken along reference lines R-R as is generally shown in Figs. 9. The nozzle head portion (24) includes a bore (55) within which is fitted the proximal end portion of the dip tube (40), and an flow channel (46). As discussed with reference to Fig.9, there is also present a recess (88) whose side boundaries are indicated by the two dotted lines in Fig. 10, with the recess being within these dotted lines. It is also to be understood that as the recess (88) does not coincide with the reference line R-R but is depicted to be a projection thereupon. It is further to be understood that as in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, the air flow channel (46) has a height dimension which can be as little as approximately 1 millimeter, or which can extend as long as the length of the proximal end portion (42) of the dip tube (40) which is inserted in the boss (38) and nozzle head portion (24), or may be even longer. As in Fig. 2, the air flow channel (46) in Fig. 10 has a cross-sectional area (56) and each have open ends (54) which contact the outer wall (52) of the dip tube (40) and again, the interior of the dip tube (50) also has a cross-sectional area (58). Again, it is to be understood that the cross-sectional area (56) of the air flow channel (46) is to be equal to, but desirably, less than the total cross-sectional area of the interior (58) of the dip tube (40). Desirably, the cross-sectional area (56) is less than 80% of the cross-sectional area of the interior of the dip tube (58), yet more desirably is less than 50%, but most desirably is not more than 30% of the area of the cross-sectional area of the interior (58) of dip tube (40).<br>
While described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the present disclosure is to be interpreted as by way of illustration, and not by way of limitation, and that various modifications and alterations apparent to one skilled in the art may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
