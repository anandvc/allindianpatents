The dichloropropene compounds containing benzoxazol-2-yloxy moiety were prepared successfully in this invention and their excellent insecticidal activity have been proved by extensive research and experiments. During the course of further research, the inventors found surprisingly that in benzoxazole ring of the compounds represented by general formula I, introducing substituents to 5-position was more beneficial than to 6-position. Compared to the compounds with higher bioactivity in the existing technology, the compounds of present invention were used at lower dosage, normally more than once lower at the same control, showing unexpected high insecticidal activity. Therefore, the present invention also includes the use of the compounds having general formula I as insecticides to control insect pests.<br>
A further object of the present invention also includes insecticidal compositions containing the compounds having general formula I as active ingredient, and the weight percentage of the active ingredient in the composition is 1-99%. The insecticidal compositions also include the carrier being acceptable in agriculture, forestry, public health.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be used in the form of various formulations. Usually, the compounds having general formula I as active ingredient can be dissolved in or dispersed in carriers or made to a formulation so that they can be easily dispersed as an insecticide. For example: these chemical formulations can be made into wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrate. Therefore, in these compositions, at least a liquid or solid carrier is added, and suitable surfactant(s) can be added when needed. <br>
Still also provided by the present invention are the application methods for controlling insects, which is to apply the compositions of the present invention to the insects as mentioned above or their growing loci. The suitable effective dosage of the compounds of the present invention is usually within a range of 10 g/ha to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 20 g/ha to 500 g/ha.<br>
For some applications, one or more other fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators or fertilizer can be added into the insecticidal compositions of the present invention to make additional merits and effects.<br>
It should be noted that variations and changes are permitted within the claimed scopes in the present invention.<br><br>
