				<td>Substituted 6-(2-tolyl)-triazolopyrimidines Description<br>
The invention relates to substituted 6-(2-tolyl)-triazolopyrimidines of formula I<br>
I<br>
in which <br>
R1 and R2 independently denote hydrogen or C1-C10-alkyl, C2-C10_al-kenyl, C2-C1o-alkynyl, or C4-C10-alkadienyl, C1-C10-haloalkyl, C2~C10-haloalkenyl' C3-C10-cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, or<br>
5- or 6-membered heterocyclyl, containing one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom, or<br>
5- or 6-membered heteroaryl, containing one to four nitrogen atoms or one to three nitrogen atoms and one sulfur or oxygen atom, or<br>
where R1 and R2 radicals may be unsubstituted or partly or fully halogenated or may carry one to three groups Ra,<br>
Ra  is cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, C1-C6-alkyl, C3~C6-cycloalkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy,C1-C8-alkylthio,C1-C8-alkylamino, di-C1-C6-alkylamino, C2-C6~alkenyl, C2-C6~alkenyloxy, C2-C6-alkynyl, C3-C6-alkynyloxy and Ci-C4-alkylenedioxy; or<br>

n   is an integer from 1 to 4; and<br>
X   is halogen, cyano, C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C6-alkoxy, C1-C6-haloalkoxy or C3-C8-alkenyloxy.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes for their preparation, compositions containing them and to their use for combating phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
6-Phenyl-7-amino-triazolopyrimidines are generally known from US 4,567,262 and US 5,593,996.<br>
Triazolopyrimidines with a trifluorophenyl group in 6-position are disclosed in WO-A 98/46607 and EP-A 945 453.<br>
From WO-A 98/46608 diverse 6-phenyl-triazolopyrimidines are known, which are substituted in the 7-position by fluorinated alky 1 amines .<br>
The compounds disclosed in the documents discussed above are said to be active against various phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds having improved fungicidal activity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the compounds defined at the outset. Furthermore, we have found processes for their preparation, compositions comprising them and methods for controlling phytopathogenic fungi using the compounds I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I differ from the compounds known from closest prior art WO-A 98/46608 in the 2-tolyl group, which is further substituted.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I as defined above which comprises reacting 5-amino-triazole with 2-(2-tolyl)-substituted malonic acid ester of formula II, in which<br><br>
R represents alkyl, preferably C1-C8-alkyl, in particular methyl or ethyl, under alkaline conditions, preferably using high boiling tertiary amines as for example tri-n-butylamine as disclosed for example by EP-A 770 615 to yield compounds of formula III.<br><br>
The resulting 5,7-dihydroxy-6-phenyl-triazolopyrimidine of formula III, wherein R3 and n are as defined for formula I, is subsequently treated with a halogenating agent, preferably with a bro-minating or chlorinating agent, such as phosphorus oxybromide or phosphorus oxychloride, neat or in the presence of a solvent to give IV.<br><br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 °C to 15 0 °C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 80 °C to 125 °C as disclosed for example by EP-A 770 615.<br>
Dihalotriazolopyrimidine IV is further reacted with an amine of formula V<br>
R2&gt;"H	V<br>
in which R1 and R2 are as defined in formula I to produce compounds of formula I in which X is halogen.<br>
The reaction between the 5,7-dihalo compound IV and the amine of formula V can be carried out under conditions known from WO-A 98/46608. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers, such as dioxane, diethyl ether and, especially, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene.<br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0°C to 70°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 10°C to 35°C.<br>
It is also preferred that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, and inorganic bases, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. Alternatively, an excess of the compound of formula V may serve as a base.<br>
Compounds of formula I in which X denotes cyano,C1-C8-alkoxy,C1-C8-haloalkoxy or C3-Cs-alkenyloxy can be prepared by reacting compounds I in which X is halogen, preferably chloro, with compounds of formula VI, which are, dependent from the value of X'<br><br>
to be introduced to yield formula I compounds, an anorganic cyano salt, an alkoxylate, haloalkoxylate or an alkenyloxylate, respectively, preferably in the presence of a a solvent. The cation M in formula VI has minor influence; for practical and economical reasons usually ammonium-, tetraalkylammonium- or alkalimetal-and earth metal salts are preferred.<br><br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 to 120°C, the preferred reaction temperature being from 10 to 40°C [cf. J. Heterocycl. Chem. , Vol.12, p. 861-863 (1975)].<br>
Suitable solvents include ethers, such as dioxane, diethyl ether and, especially, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene .<br>
Compounds of formula I in which X denotes C1-C6-alkyl can be prepared by reacting compounds I in which X is halogen, preferably chloro, with malonic acid esters of formula VII, wherein X" denotes H or C1-C8-alkyl and R denotes Ci-C4-alkyl, to compounds of formula VIII and decarboxylation under conditions described in US 5,994,360.<br>
I(X=Hal)  +<br>
VIII <br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to the novel intermediates of formulae II, III and IV.<br>
The compounds of formula II are preferably prepared by reaction of the corresponding substituted bromobenzenes with sodium dial-kylmalonates in the presence of a copper(I) salt [cf. Chemistry Letters, pp. 367-370, 1981; EP-A 10 02 788].<br><br>
The compounds of formula II may also be prepared by reaction of an alkyl 2-(2-tolyl)-acetate with dialkylcarbonate in the presence of a strong base, preferably sodium ethoxide and sodium hydride (cf. Heterocycles, pp. 1031-1047, 1996).<br>
The substituted phenylacetates which are the starting compounds for compounds of formula II are known and commercially available, and/or they are obtainable by generally known methods.<br>
The reaction mixtures are worked up in a customary manner, for example by mixing with water, phase separation and, if required, chromatographic purification of the crude products. Some of the end products are obtained in the form of colorless or slightly brownish, viscous oils, which are purified or freed from volatile components under reduced pressure and at moderately elevated temperatures. If the end products are obtained as solids, purification can also be carried out by recrystallization or digestion.<br>
If individual compounds I are not obtainable by the routes described above, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds I.<br>

Moreover, the compounds I are suitable for controlling harmful fungi such as Paecilomyces variotii in the protection of materials (e.g. wood, paper, paint dispersions, fibers and tissues) and in the protection of stored products.<br>
The compounds I are applied by treating the fungi, or the plants, seeds, materials or the soil to be protected against fungal infection, with a fungicidally active amount of the active ingredients. Application can be effected both before and after infection of the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi.<br>
In general, the fungicidal compositions comprise from 0.1 to 95, preferably 0.5 to 90, % by weight of active ingredient.<br>
When used in crop protection, the rates of application are from 0.01 to 2.0 kg of active ingredient per ha, depending on the nature of the effect desired.<br>
In the treatment of seed, amounts of active ingredient of from 0.001 to 0.1 g, preferably 0.01 to 0.05 g, are generally required per kilogram of seed.<br>
When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the rate of application of active ingredient depends on the nature of the field of application and on the effect desired. Rates of application conventionally used in the protection of materials are,<br><br>
for example, from 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005" g to 1 kg, of active ingredient per cubic meter of material treated.<br>
The compounds I can be converted into the customary formulations, e.g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the particular purpose; in any case, it should guarantee a fine and uniform distribution of the compound according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it also being possible to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Auxiliaries which are suitable are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (e.g. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (e.g. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (e.g. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (e.g. methanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. cy-clohexanone) , amines (e.g. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (e.g. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (e.g. highly-disperse silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers (e.g. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates) and dispersants such as li-gnin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Suitable surfactants are alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of lignosulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, phenolsulfonic acid, dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, alkylaryl-sulfonates, alkyl sulfates, alkylsulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates and fatty acids and their alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts, salts of sulfated fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and naphthalene derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of napthalenesulfonic acid with phenol or formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctylphenol, octylphenol, nonylphenol, al-kylphenol polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, ethoxylated polyoxypropylene, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetal, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Substances which are suitable for the preparation of directly sprayable solutions, emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point, such as kerosene or diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocar-<br><br>
bons, e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene, paraffin, tetrahydronaphtha-lene, alkylated naphthalenes or their derivatives, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, cy-clohexanol, cyclohexanone, chlorobenzene, isophorone, strongly polar solvents, e.g. dimethylf ormamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-me-thylpyrrolidone and water.<br>
Powders, materials for scattering and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Examples of solid carriers are mineral earths, such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, attaclay, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers, e.g. ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise of from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 90% by weight, of the active ingredient. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are exemplary formulations:<br>
I.	5 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are mixed intimately with 95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 5% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
II.	3 0 parts by weight of a compound according to the invention are mixed intimately with a mixture of 92 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel and 8 parts by weight of paraffin oil which had been sprayed onto the surface of this silica gel.
