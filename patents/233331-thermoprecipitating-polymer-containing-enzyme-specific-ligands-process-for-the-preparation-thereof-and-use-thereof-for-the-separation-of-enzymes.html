				<td>THERMOPRECIPITATING POLYMER CONTAINING ENZYME SPECIFIC LIGANDS, PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF, AND USE THEREOF FOR THE SEPARATION OF ENZYMES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel thermo precipitating polymers containing enzyme specific ligands. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such enzyme specific ligands and to monomers embodying such ligands. More particularly, the present invention also relates to a process for the separation of enzymes using such thermoprecipitating polymers. The invention also relates to a process for the separation of lysozyme and lectins from a mixture of proteins and lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin and tomato agglutinin.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The separation and recovery of biomolecules like enzymes and glycoproteins are critical cost determining steps in most of the down stream processes in biotechnology industries. Conventionally, separation of lysozyme from the crude sources has been done by salt precipitation (Hasegawa, Mineo, Yoshida, Kazuya, Miyauchi, Sakae, Terazono, Masami: US Patent No. 4504583, (1985)) or by ion exchange techniques (Hasegawa, Mineo, Ozaki, Kitao: US Patent No. 4705755 (1987); Durance, Timothy, Li-Chan, Eunice, Nakai, Shuryo: US Patent No. 4966851 (1990); Hasegawa, Mineo: US Patent No. 4518695 (1985); Takechi, Kaz, Takahashi, Tsuyos, Inaba, Toyoaki, Hasegawa, Eiichi: US Patent No. 4104125 (1978).<br>
Various techniques based on affinity interactions between enzyme - inhibitor, enzyme - substrate, enzyme - transition state analog, enzyme - cofactor and the like have been developed as better alternatives to the above-mentioned conventional systems for the selective recovery of enzymes. Most of the affinity based separations involve polymers to which the affinity ligand or cofactors or dyes are chemically linked. The complex formed between enzyme and the polymeric ligand is subsequently processed to isolate the enzyme.<br>
These alternative systems primarily involve affinity chromatography or affinity ultrafiltration. Although these techniques provide high selectivity, they are beset with several practical difficulties which are summarised below.<br><br>
Bozzano A. G., Glatz C. E., J. Memb.Sci 55, 181 - 198 (1991); Ehsani N, Parkkinen S., Nystrom M. J. Memb Sci 123, 105 - 119, (1997) disclose that affinity ultrafiltration is suitable for the separation of enzyme only in cases where the difference between the molecular weights of the desired enzyme and other biomolecules is appreciably large. Also, at high pressures, the denaturation of the enzyme and fouling of the membrane leads to poor product quality (Ehsani N., Parkkinen S., Nystrom M. J. Memb Sci 123, 105-119, (1997)).<br>
Affinity chromatography (Hirano S., Kaneko H., Kitagawa M., Agric. Biol. Chem, 55, 1683 - 1684 (1991); Safrik L., Safarikova M., J. Biochem Biophys. Methods, 27, 327 - 330 (1993); Reid, Lome S.: US Patent No. 4552845 (1985)) is found suitable only for small capacity columns. Scale up of the columns retards the flow rate and leads to clogging of the columns, thereby resulting in increased cost of the process. Another disadvantage of this process is that it is non-continuous since periodic flushing is required at specified time intervals to remove any undesirable non-specifically adsorbed biomolecules in the column (Chern C. S., Lee C. K., Chen C. Y., Yeh M. J., Colloids and Surfaces B. Biointerfaces. 6 37 - 49, (1996)).<br>
Affinity precipitation eliminates many of the above-mentioned problems and offers certain advantages such as ease of scale up, amenability to continuous operation and recycling of the affinity ligand (Chern C. S., Lee C. K., Chen C. Y., Yeh M. J., Colloids and Surfaces B. Biointerfaces. 6 37 - 49, (1996)). Affinity precipitation involves the formation of a complex between the enzyme and a stimuli sensitive affinity polymer in a homogeneous solution. This complex is precipitated by a change in the pH, temperature or ionic strength. This complex is dissociated and the polymer is separated by varying either one of the above-mentioned stimuli and the enzyme is then isolated (Gupta M. N., Kaul R., Guogiang D., and Mattiasson B., J. Mol. Recog. 9, 356 - 359, (1996)). Thus the recovery of the enzyme by this process is much simpler.<br>
It is well known that ligands containing N-acetyl groups such as N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, chitin, chitosan, and the like exhibit affinity for various enzymes and lectins (Tyagi R., Kumar A., Sardar M., Kumar S., Gupta M. N., Isol.Purif. 2, 217 - 226, (1996); Katz, Friedrich D., Fishman, Louis, Levy: US Patent No.: 3940317 (1976)).<br><br>
All the above ligands are derived from glucose. Since glucose is a carbons source for many microbes, such ligands are susceptible to microbial attack and hydrolytic degradation resulting in poor stability of these ligands (Hirano S., Kaneko H., Kitagawa M., Agric. Biol. Chem, 55, 1683 - 1684 (1991)). Also chitosan is insoluble in alkaline media while crosslinked chitosan and chitin are insoluble in both alkaline and acidic media (Ruckstein, Eli; Zeng, Xianfang; Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 56, 610 - 617 (1997)). This limits their use. Moreover, chitin and chitosan can undergo transglycosylation and mutarotation, which drastically reduces their efficiency in any affinity based recovery of enzyme (Davies, R. C., Neuberger, A., Wilson, B. M., Biochem. Biophys Acta, 178, 294 - 305, (1969); Neuberger, A., Wilson, B. M., Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 147, 473 -486, (1967)). Thus, it is desirable to replace glucose by stable synthetic ligands during the synthesis of thermoprecipitating affinity polymers for enzyme separations.<br>

in an acidic aqueous solution, raising the temperature of the solution above the LCST of the polymer, isolating the precipitated polymer and recovering lysozyme from the solution.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The N-acetyl group containing ligands are synthesised by dissolving straight chain amino acids of the formula HOOC-(CH2)i-(CO-NH)m-(CH2)n-NH2 wherein 1 is an integer in the range of 1 to 10 and m and n are either 0 or 1 and equimolar NaOH in water at 5 - 20°C, adding the acetylating agent dropwise to the above solution while maintaining the pHin the range of 7.4 - 7.8 by the addition of NaOH, stirring the reaction mixture for 2 hours at 25°C, acidifying to pH 2.0, precipitating the product by cooling to 4°C for 24 hours, reprecipitating the product from water into acetone.<br>
The monomers containing acrylated N-acetyl group are synthesised by dissolving the affinity lignad of the formula HOOC-(CH2)i-(CO-NH)m-(CH2)n-NH-CO-CHs wherein 1 is an integer in the range of from 1 to 10 and m and n are either 0 or 1, and acrylate monomer having the formula H2C=CR-COC1 or H2C=CCH3-CO-O-(CH2)2-OH wherein R is either hydrogen or methyl, and a condensing agent in tetrahydrofuran, at 5 - 20°C, stirring this reaction mixture for 48 hours at the same temperature, filtering the precipitate and concentrating the filtrate to obtain the viscous liquid, pouring this liquid into cold water to precipitate the product and then drying the product and preserving it under petroleum at 4°C.<br>
The affinity precipitating polymers of the general formula 1 are prepared by dissolving the monomer containing acrylated N-acetyl group of the formula 2 and thermosensitive monomer of the formula 3 in water or dimethylformamide (DMF), purging this reaction mixture with nitrogen for 10 to 30 minutes at 37 and 80°C respectively, adding polymerisation initiator and polymerisation accelerator, allowing polymerisation to proceed for 5 to 8 hours under nitrogen purging at the same temperature, precipitating the product either by increasing the temperature of the aqueous solution above the LCST or in diethyl ether.<br>
The separation of lysozyme from other proteins is carried out using the thermoprecipitating polymer of the invention. An aqueous solution of the polymer is mixed with lysozyme -ovalbumin mixture allowing equilibrium for 8 to 24 hours at 4 to 20°C, raising the solution temperature above the LCST (21 to 45°C) of the affinity<br>
polymer thereby precipitating the polymer - lysozyme complex, separating the precipitated complex by centrifugation, redissolving the complex in an acidic solution and again raising the temperature of the solution above the LCST of the affinity polymer, and then separating the filtrate containing free lysozyme by centrifugation, repeating the procedure for sixteen cycles for determination of reusability and stability of the polymers of the invention during recovery of lysozyme.<br>
Although the present invention describes a process for the synthesis of ligands containing pendant N-acetyl groups and acrylated monomers containing N-acetyl groups and their subsequent use in the preparation of thermoprecipitating polymers useful in the enhanced recovery of lysozyme from a mixture of lysozyme and ovalbumin as well as reusability and enhanced stability of these polymers during recovery of lysozyme, the scope of the present invention is not and should not be construed to be limited to only such affinity polymers for the separation of lysozyme but can extend to such combinations of polymer bound affinity ligands and enzymes or lectins to which such ligands bind selectively.<br>
The invention is also not limited to those ranges provided herein. The ranges and limitations provided herein are believed to particularly point out the invention. However, other ranges and limitations which perform substantially the same function in the same or substantially the same manner to obtain the same or substantially the same results are intended to be within the scope of the instant invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
11.1 g (0.05 M) N-acetylglucosamine and 4.2 g (0.05M) sodium bicarbonate was dissolved in 100 ml water. To this 5 ml (0.06M) acryloyl chloride in 5 ml dichloromethane (DCM) was added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes at 15°C. During this period the pH of the solution was maintained at 7.5 by adding saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. After the addition of acryloyl chloride was over and the pH of the reaction mixture was steady, unreacted acryloyl chloride was extracted in 100 ml ethyl acetate. The clear aqueous solution was separated and acidified to pH 5.0 by concentrated HC1. Then the product (Ac.NAG) was previpitated in acetone and maintained at 4°C overnight to maximise the precipitation. The precipitated product was filtered. The product was reprecipitated from water into acetone. The thermoprecipitating polymer containing this monomer was prepared as follows: 0.238<br>
g (0.07M) NIPAM, 0.248 g (0.03M) Ac.NAG were dissolved in 30 ml of water taken in a round bottom flask. Polymerisation was initiated at 37°C under nitrogen purging by the addition of 10 (w/w) of AMPS and 1% v/w of TEMED. Polymerisation was allowed to proceed for 6 hours at 37°C. Then, the polymer was precipitated by raising the temperature of the reaction mixture above the LCST of the polymer. The precipitated polymer was washed twice with cold double distilled water and once with cold 0.066 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and dried under vacuum at room temperature.<br>
Example 2<br>
21.3 g of acrylamide (0.3M), 0.5 g 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine and 24.2 ml (0.3M) pyridine was dissolved in 800 ml HPLC grade THF. The reaction mixture was stirred at 10°C to obtain a clear solution. Then 21.3 ml (0.3M) acetyl chloride in 22 ml THF was added dropwise to the above reaction mixture over 1 hour. After the addition of acetyl chloride was over, a sticky yellow precipitate of pyridine -HC1 was obtained. This precipitate was filtered under vacuum to obtain a clear THF solution, which was then concentrated under vacuum at 40°C to obtain a semisolid mass. This was precipitated in petroleum ether to get a low melting semisolid product (acetylacrylamide). The polymerisation comprising this monomer was carried out as follows: 0.238 g (0.07M) NIPAM and 0.102 g (0.03M) acetylacrylamide were dissolved in 30 ml of water taken in a round bottom flask. Polymerisation was initiated at 37°C under nitrogen purging by the addition of 10 (w/w) of AMPS and 1% v/w of TEMED. Polymerisation was allowed to proceed for 6 hours at 37°C. Then, the polymer was precipitated by raising the temperature of the reaction mixture above the LCST of the polymer. The precipitated polymer was washed twice with cold double distilled water and once with cold 0.066M phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) and dried under vacuum at room temperature.<br>
Example 3<br>
7.5 g (0.1M) glycine and 4 g (0.1M) sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 80 ml water. To it 9.5 ml (0.1M) acetic anhydride was added over a period of 30 minutes at 15°C. During this addition, pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at 7.5. After the addition was over, the reaction mixture was stirred for two hours and acidified to pH 2.0 by concentrated HC1. It was maintained at -4°C overnight. This reaction mixture was allowed to thaw and the precipitated product (2-acetamido glycine) was<br>
filtered. The product was reprecipitated from water into acetone. The monomer (2,(methacryloyl)oxy 2, ethylacetamidoglycinate) was prepared as follows: in a round bottom flask, 4.1 g (0.035M) 2-acetamido glycine, 4.3 ml (0.035M) 2, hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), 4.8g (0.035M) l,hydroxybenzotriazole were dissolved in 300 ml dry THF. This reaction mixture was stirred at 15°C under dry conditions to obtain a clear solution. Then, 7.3 g (0.035M) DCC dissolved in 10 ml of THF was added to the above reaction mixture. It was allowed to stir at 15°C for 48 hours. A heavy white precipitate of dicyclohexyl urea salt was filtered and the clear filtrate was concentrated under vacuum at 40°C to obtain an oily semisolid mass. This was precipitated in cold water. The white product obtained was dried and preserved under hexane at 4°C till further use. Thermoprecipitating polymer was prepared as follows: 0.40 g (0.07M) NIPAM and 0.28g (0.03M) 2,(methacryloyl)oxyethyl 2,acetamidoglycinate were dissolved in 50ml of dry DMF taken in a round bottom flask. This was allowed to stir under continuous nitrogen purging to obtain a clear solution. Then, the solution temperature was slowly raised to 80°C. Polymerisation was initiated by adding 10% (w/w) of AIBN dissolved in 1 ml DMF. This reaction was maintained at 80°C for 6 hours under continuous nitrogen purging. The mass was cooled to 37°C and the polymer was precipitated in diethyl ether. The precipitated product was dried at 40°C.<br>
Example 4<br>
8.9 g (0.1 M) P alanine and 4 g (0.1M) sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 80 ml water. To it, 9.5 ml (0.1M) acetic anhydride was added over a period of 30 minutes at 15°C. During this addition pH of the reaction mixture was maintained at 7.5. After the addition was over, this reaction mixture was stirred for two hours and acidified to pH 2.0 by concentrated HC1. It was maintained at -4°C overnight. This reaction mixture was allowed to thaw and the precipitated product (3-acetamido Palaninate) was filtered. The product was reprecipitated from water into acetone. The monomer 2,(methacryloyl)oxyethyl 3-acetamidopalaninate) was prepared as follows: in a round bottom flask 4.6 g (0.035M) 3-acetamido palaninate and 4.3 ml (0.035M) 1, hydroxybenzotriazole were dissolved in 300 ml dry THF. This reaction mixture was stirred at 15°C under dry conditions to obtain a clear solution. Then, 7.3 g (0.035M) DCC dissolved in 10ml of THF was added to the above reaction mixture. It was<br>
allowed to stir at 15°C for 48 hours. A heavy white precipitate of dicyclohexyl urea salt was filtered and the clear filtrate was concentrated under vacuum at 40°C to obtain an oily semisolid mass. It was dissolved in minimum amount of dry ethyl acetate and this clear solution was precipitated in petroleum ether to obtain white solid, which was kept over petroleum ether till further use. Thermoprecipitating polymer was prepared as follows: 0.40 g (0.07M) NIPAM and 0.36g (0.03M) 2,(methacryloyl)oxyethyl 2,acetamidopalaninate were dissolved in 50ml of dry DMF taken in a round bottom flask. This was allowed to stir under continuous nitrogen purging to obtain a clear solution. Then, the solution temperature was slowly raised to 80°C. Polymerisation was initiated by adding 10% (w/w) of AIBN dissolved in 1 ml DMF. This reaction was maintained at 80°C for 6 hours under continuous nitrogen purging. The mass was cooled to 37°C and the polymer was precipitated in diethyl ether. The precipitated product was dried at 40°C. Example 5<br>
10.3 g (0.1 M) 4 amino butyric acid and 4 g (0.1M) sodium hydroxide was dissolved in 80 ml water. To it, 9.5 ml (0.1M) acetic anhydride was added over a period of 30 minutes at 15°C.

Example 8<br>
Relative binding of affinity thermoprecipitating polymer was determined following a procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 147,473-486(1967).<br>
The concentration of N-acetyl groups required to obtain 35% relative binding i.e. 135 for various thermoprecipitating affinity polymers is summarized in Table 1.<br>
Table 1: Relative binding of thermoprecipitating polymers<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Example 9<br>
Ten millilitres of respective 1% w/v thermoprecipitating polymer solution was mixed with lysozyme and ovalbumin (27(ig/ml respectively) synthetic mixture. This solution was incubated at 20°C for 16 hours with continuous shaking at 200 rpm. Then, the temperature of the mixture was raised above the LCST of the polymer to precipitate the lysozyme - polymer complex. The complex was separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 20 minutes above LCST. The precipitated polymer was dissolved in dilute acetic acid solution (pH 2.0). The temperature of this dissociated complex was raised above LCST and the precipitated polymer was separated by centrifugation. The clear filtrate was assayed for lysozyme using Micrococcus lysodeikticus as a substrate following the procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 147, 473 - 486, (1967). Lysozyme recovery was estimated in terms of unit activity recovered/mM of N-acetyl groups present in the polymer and the date is given in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Recovery of lysozyme from lysozyme - ovalbumin mixture<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 10<br>
Ten millilitres of respective 1% w/v thermoprecipitating polymer solution was mixed with 27ug/ml lysozyme solution. It was allowed to incubate at 20°C for 16 hours. Then, the temperature of the mixture was raised above the LCST of the polymer to precipitate the lysozyme - polymer complex. The complex was separated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 20 minutes above LCST. The precipitated polymer was dissolved in dilute acetic acid solution (pH 2.0). The temperature of this dissociated complex was raised above LCST and the precipitated polymer was separated by centrifugation. The clear filtrate was assayed for protein content using Lowrey's procedure and activity of lysozyme was measured using Micrococcus lysodeikticm as a substrate following the procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 147, 473 - 486, (1967). The graph of specific activity recovered in terms of unit activity/unit protein vs. number of cycles is given in figure 1.<br>
The data in Table 2 shows that the activity of lysozyme revoered per mM of acetamido groups increased from 6657 units (see Example 3) to 33672 units (see Example 7). Thus, in a lysozyme - ovalbumin mixture thermoprecipitating polymers exhibit selectivity towards lysozyme. The percent recovery in terms of specific activity (unit activity/unit protein) as a function of the number of cycles is shown in Figure 1. The data shows that even after 16 cycles the decrease in the percent recovery in terms of specific activity was 21 % and 20 % in the case of Example 6 and Example 7 respectively. But for Example 1, the decrease in the percent recovery in terms of specific activity was 50%. Thus, the polymers synthesised as reported in this invention are more stable as compared to NAG containing polymer. Moreover, these polymers are reusable for 16 continuous cycles of solubility/precipitation.<br>
