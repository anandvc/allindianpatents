EBBrSU     FINAL ACCEPTED<br>
The poultry feed which accounts for over 70% of the cost of production in poultry is manufactured by 100 plus medium and large feed mills and account for about 40% of total feed consumed. The balance 60% is either custom made by small feed mills or hand mixed by poultry farmers. The Poultry medical care including vaccines etc is well developed and available in all poultry pockets. The human expertise in the form of Poultry consultants is of highest standards through the university and govt, laboratory support. The marketing of eggs is supported by NECC (National Egg co-ordination committee). The NECC issues prices on daily basis depending on market needs. The broiler prices too are governed by supply and demand. The industry growth over the last 5-6 years has been steady with some ups and towns.<br>
The layer growth annually has been around 2% and broiler growth is estimated at 10-12%.<br>
In brief Indian poultry Industry is well developed and supports several thousand farmers and allied industry people.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION- The invention is poultry feed supplement which is able to cure dehydration in baby chicks. The commercial and parent chick supply from 500 hatcheries is made to various parts of the country involving the transportation time up to 15 to 20 hours by road, rail or air. The climatic conditions at different times of the year make the day old chick's life difficult. The chicks suffer from dehydration and stress. The conditions at times are so extreme that there may be more than 5% losses due to mortality and 20-30% due to morbidity, (prevention) These losses are estimated around Rs. 400<br><br><br><br><br>
crore or more each year. The need to keep the chicks healthy at the end of their journey from hatchery to a new farmhouse is greatly felt by all concerned.<br>
Prior art - With reference to the above mentioned invention there is no prior art available in the form of granted patents at USPTO, EPO and WIPO. Before, when chicks in transit suffered from tremendous dehydration, the only supplement provided to the chicks was watermelon or water. The disadvantages in using a water melon were that chicks were placed in cardboard boxes where number of the chicks in each box was greater than the box could contain. As a result large number of chicks was cramped together in these cardboard boxes which resulted in gross dehydration and increased rate of mortality. Only 0.2 % of these chicks survived in transit because of sordid, unhygienic and inhuman conditions. In such a situation water melon was used as poultry feed supplement to prevent dehydration. A lot of disadvantages were incurred in usage of water melon as poultry feed supplement . Water melon being of a reasonably large size could not be fed to the chicks without being cut into small pieces. The exposed flesh of the water melon was susceptible to growth of bacteria thus inviting a lot of infections. Further more the water melon is 76 % water and hence a dangerous breeding ground for fungal growth thus rendering itself unpalatable as well as unhygienic for the G.I tract of newly born chicks . One more factor that needs due consideration is watermelon being a seasonal fruit is available only in the summer season in the month of May and<br><br><br>
thus chicks face further deprivation where poultry farmers rely only on<br>
the availability of water melon.<br>
Watermelon   is  not  only  cooling   but  is  also  a   natural  diuretic.<br>
Watermelon is very alkaline in nature. It has a soothing effect on the<br>
stomach  and  prevent  bilousness.   It  is  a thirst quencher and  is<br>
beneficial for those suffering from kidney problems and urinary tract<br>
infections.  Water melon  helps rehydrate the body and  is  low in<br>
calories and high in nutrients. The basic disadvantage of water melon<br>
is that it is subject to decomposition and hence should be fed to the<br>
chicks soon after extraction as it loses its properties.<br>

The importance of water to the chicken is related to its chemical and physical properties. These include its polarity and use as a solvent in the digestion and absorption of food, the transport of nutrients in the body and the elimination of waste products via the urine. Its low viscosity contributes to its ability to move freely through the small blood capillaries throughout the body, thereby distributing nutrients to,<br><br>
\V   i&amp;a
 <br>
and removing waste products from tissues. It also has a high specific heat and heat of vaporization which means that large amounts of heat can be transported in the blood and dissipated through respiration. A satisfactory intake of water is necessary for the maintenance of normal food intake, the growth of tissues and egg production. Water intake varies with age, rate of egg production, dietary composition and ambient temperature. The latter factor contributes most to variations in water consumption since respiration is the major route of heat loss from the body at high temperatures, which greatly increase water requirements. The water: food intake ratio Increases from approximately 2:1 at moderate temperatures to about 5:1 at 35C. Therefore, the presence of nutrients in drinking water can markedly influence nutrient intakes.<br>
The importance of water is accepted without question by poultry producers who also recognize other advantages. These include its use in electrolyte replacement therapy and in treatment with drugs where water medication is particularly important when food intake is reduced by fever or stress. However, for the unwary producer, the visual purity of water can mask many problems that may affect the profitability of an enterprise. In particular, chemical and biological contaminants are found in many natural sources of water. These include contamination from fertilizers, pesticides and decaying organic material; the latter also being associated with bacterial contamination.<br>

An important aspect of water quality, which can potentially affect poultry performance, is the mineral content. Until recently this aspect of poultry nutrition had received little attention and little definitive information was available to assess water quality from this viewpoint. The inventor reviews the current situation with respect to broiler and egg-layer performance.<br>
Minerals in Water<br>
While the nutritional importance of minerals in the diet has been examined extensively, the role of minerals in drinking water has received much less attention. This is surprising since underground water supplies are a common source of drinking water for poultry in many countries and such water often contains high concentrations of dissolved mineral salts. These salts can contribute to the mineral requirements of poultry although their presence is usually not considered when estimates of requirements are made. (Ross, 1979). However, when present in high concentrations many minerals can prove toxic and it is under these conditions that reductions in growth and laying performance can occur.<br>
10<br><br>
It appears that biological responses to minerals may vary depending on whether they are present in the diet or drinking water. Ross (1979) compared the responses of broiler chickens to sodium chloride (NaCI) in the diet and drinking water and reported that, when allowance was made for differences in food and water intakes, sodium in the drinking water was used more effectively than sodium in the diet. Also, Yoselewitz and Belnave (1989a) have shown that when hens consume similar total intakes of NaCI, egg shell quality differs depending on whether the NaCI is included in the diet or drinking water.<br>
Studies with dietary supplements have shown variability in individual bird tolerances to NaCI. Also, the tissue edema observed in chickens dying from salt poisoning was less marked the longer chickens received NaCI supplements prior to death (Blaxland, 1946). Older birds were more tolerant of NaCI than newly-hatched chickens and overcame the problem of high-NaCI intakes by drinking large amounts of water and, therefore, producing very wet excreta. This method would not appear to be advantageous for chickens receiving NaCI in drinking water, since an increase in water intake automatically increases the intake of NaCI. It is worth noting that in recent studies at Cornell University (Balnave and Austic, Unpublished data), where NaCI supplements of up to 2 g/l of drinking water or 4 g/kg of diet were given between one and six weeks of age to broiler chickens receiving a commercial-type diet containing 2.5 g NaCI/kg, observed increases in the intakes of drinking water of up to 15% were insufficient to visually alter the texture and consistency of the excreta.<br>
11<br><br><br>
Detailed information on the responses of growing birds to minerals in the drinking water is limited. Seyle (1943) reported that when 9g NaCI/l of drinking water was given to 19-day-old chickens, some died within five days, but others survived up to 20 days. When 3g NaCI/l was given to four-week-old chicks, all survived for the two weeks of the experiment. Blaxland (1946) reported that 9g NaCI/l of drinking water gave 100% mortality in one-week-old chickens. In these studies, and in that by Kare and Biely (1948), all birds died when chicks received drinking water containing 20g NaCI/l within one week of hatch. Seyle (1943) reported that chickens consumed large amounts of this salt water and all died within three days, whereas Kare and Biely (1948) reported that chickens drank little and died within one week. These latter workers reported that at low concentrations, the toxicity of sodium chloride given in the drinking water was approximately the same as an equivalent intake from the diet. They also found that a supplement of 3g NaCL per litre of drinking water was not toxic to two-day-old chicks.<br>
For better health chicks must learn quickly to drink &amp; eat. There is an old concept that chicks can get along without water and feed supplement up to 3 days after hatching but such a delay is detrimental because birds undergo lot of stress due to handling, vaccination, de beaking, transportation etc. which are the causes of<br><br>
y&gt;<br><br>
morbidity and morality in chicks. Any delay only dehydrates and weakens them, weak chicks do not learn to drink and eat readily. For best results chicks should be given water as soon as they are hatched. As per scientific evidence one day old chicks needs approx 4 ml (4gm) of water in 12 hours at 21°C. Which can be approx period for transportation from hatchery to commercial farms.<br>

Scientific evidence also confirms the pH of the crop of chicken to average approx, 4.5 and the proventriculus at pH 4.4. the pH of the gizzard is lowest at 2.6. the pH of the remainder alimentary tract ranges between pH 5.7-6.5 (crop, proventriculur, gizzard are different parts of the alimentary canal).<br>
Fuerst and Kare (1961) found that baby chicks would accept the water acidified to a pH as low as 2. Water acidified by organic acids was readily accepted if pH was a 3 or 4.<br>

Water plays a very vital function in chicken life.<br>
One of the most important, yet most neglected nutrients is water. Water carries waste products, helps cool the bird by evaporation, softens feed and carries it through the digestive tract.<br>
The constitution of a baby chick is about 70% percent water. As the bird gets older, the percentage changes, but not the need for water. A young chick needs a constant supply of fresh water to stay healthy. It doesn't drink a lot of water at one time; therefore, it has to drink often.<br><br>
If you fill the waterers only in the morning, the bird may run out of water by mid-afternoon. This can cause dehydration and increased morbidity among chicks.<br>
Thus water helps to cool the bird by evaporation through lungs and air sacs. It makes up high percentage of the body 70% of day old chick is water. It forms a carrier for transportation of feed supplement in the intestinal tract. Water is an important part of blood and lymph.<br>
15<br><br>
Scientific proof further confirms as follows:-<br>
Water should be provided to chicks before feed is given. Sanitized water to be provided. The addition of sucrose to the first drinking water has shown to reduce growing mortality. Water with soluble electrolytes is given when chicks are stressed.<br>
Ref. commercial chicken manual III edition pq. 200 by MACK O. NORTH published by VAN NOSTRAND Reinhold, Newvork.<br>
PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS: Water is the most abundant liquid on earth, covering about 70% of the earth's surface. In its pure form it is odorless, tasteless and transparent, and is essential to the development, growth and survival of all animals. A fertile chicken egg, when laid, contains approximately 65% water, or 74% on a shell-free basis. This latter figure is similar to the water content of the day-old chicken. Body water content decreases with age, the water content of the adult laying hen declining to about 55%.<br>
The importance of water to the chicken is related to its chemical and physical properties. These include its polarity and use as a solvent in the digestion and absorption of food, the transport of nutrients in the body and the elimination of waste products via the urine. Its low viscosity contributes to its ability to move freely through the small blood capillaries throughout the body, thereby distributing nutrients to, and removing waste products from tissues.

Contamination of drinking water in Poultry )s a serious concern. Depending on the source, water can get contaminated with various organic and inorganic substances resulting in high pH and growth of pathogens     including     Salmonella     sp.,     E-coli     and     fungi.<br>
Water with high pH has adverse impact on efficiency of water medication i.e. antibiotics, vitamins, minerals and vaccination. Higher pH also offers favorable medium for growth of microorganisms. If the pH of water is not attended to it can have big impact on the health and production of Poultry. Birds have high basal metabolic rates &amp; so use energy at high rates Water helps to cool the bird by evaporation through lungs and air sacs. BMR is related to mass, with larger birds expending less energy per unit weight than smaller birds.<br>
Scientific proof further confirms as follows:-<br>
Water should be provided to chicks before f§ed is given.<br><br>

Summary of the invention - Safe drinking water is essential for poultry health .After the chicks are hatched at the hatchery, they undergo various stresses on the 1st day of the hatch.<br>
1st Day of birth stresses are as follows :-<br>
1.	Chicks come out of the egg shell from a controlled temp. To a normal room temp. And are taken out of the brooder which is a cause of 1st stress.<br>
2.	Chicks come out of the egg shell from a sterile environment to the environment which may not be as sterile - this will cause stress as the immune system is not fully developed in chicks during this infancy stage and hence are susceptible to bactero-viro infection and more specifically G.I. tract /intestinal infections.<br>
3.	Sexing i.e. in layer chicks male chicks are separated out by hand by an expert sexsier. During infancy the skin is relatively globerous also muscular and nerval strengths are not fully developed hence this manual handling exposes the baby chicks to widespread attack of bacteria and germs at the intestinal level referred to as primary infection site. The same infection leads to secondary flow to the nerval structures which lacks immunity.<br>
4.	Chicks are vaccinated at the hatchery by injection which causes stress due to injection and manual handling.<br>
5.	Chicks are also vaccinated at the hatchery by oral vaccination and manual handling.	Q^<br><br>
vUA^	20<br><br>
6. Debeaking is the severest form of stress. De beaking is incinerating the upper beak to a level of lower beak portion to prevent cannibalism.<br>
Now chicks are ready for market dispatches to various farms<br>
For Indian market delivery of chicks are made by tempos, trucks, train and / or aero plane depending upon distances. In transit, there are no facilities to feed supplement chicks healthy drinking water as well as feed supplement which results in severe hunger followed by dehydration due to lack of mineral contents in the body. This situation can be fatal for chicks unless addressed in time. For deliveries chicks are packed in new cardboard boxes -which have holes for ventilation and are specially created for chicken deliveries.<br>

COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
While the nutritional importance of minerals in the diet has been examined extensively, the role of minerals in drinking water has received much less attention. This is surprising since underground water supplies are a common source of drinking water for poultry in many countries and such water often contains high concentrations of dissolved mineral salts. These salts can contribute to the mineral requirements of poultry although their presence is usually not considered when estimates of requirements are made. (Ross, 1979). However, when present in high concentrations many minerals can prove toxic and it is under these conditions that reductions in growth and laying performance can occur.<br>
It appears that biological responses to minerals may vary depending<br>
on whether they are present in the diet or drinking water. Ross (1979)<br>
compared the responses of broiler chickens to sodium chloride<br>
(NaCI) in the diet and drinking water and reported that, when<br>
allowance was made for differences in food and water intakes,<br>
sodium in the drinking water was used more effectively than sodium<br>
in the diet. Also, Yoselewitz and Belnave (1989a) have shown that<br>
when hens consume similar total intakes of NaCI, egg shell quality<br>
differs depending on whether the NaCI is included in the diet or<br>
drinking water.	r<br><br><br>
Most nutritional studies with minerals have been carried out using dietary supplements, with little attention given to the role of minerals in drinking water. This is important since underground water supplies, often containing high concentrations of dissolved salts, are a common source of drinking water for poultry in many countries. Recent evidence suggests that some minerals may exert adverse effects on the performance of growing broilers and laying hens when present in drinking water at concentrations similar to those found in natural sources.<br>
The Applicant has identified this need and developed an effective feed supplement for preventing dehydration in chicks.<br>
The FEED SUPPLEMENT is feed supplement in gel form enriched with electrolytes, energy and acidified to desired pH. Following is a tabular representation of the constituents involved in making the feed supplement.<br><br>

Figure no. 2 is an illustration of the normal PH of the POULTRY digestive system.<br>
Figure no. 3 is a tabular representation of the approximate PH range of the microbial growth of different kinds of bacteria usually found in the G. I tract of baby chicks.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The obvious benefit of formulation is the prevention of dehydration. Young chicks in general and day old chicks in particular have their own specific problems. Dehydration during transportation and resultant stress can severely affect the chick's health. The affect can range from stress and early infection to mortality.<br><br>
f.      ,.'.   F-	    -<br><br>
30<br><br>
In addition the microflora in the G. I. Tract of poultry is a complex ecosystem consisting of many types of bacteria. Young chicks have a limited number of types of bacteria in the G. I. Tract therefore they do not yet have a stable microbial balance.<br>
In the case of young chicks, the pH in the G. I. Tract is still relatively high. This results in limited production of lactic acid and volatile fatty acids. This reduces the energy levels in the chicks.<br>
As a result the Gram-ve bacteria (such as E.coli) grow better in the G. I. Tract of young chicks.<br>
The solution to this serious problem lies in preventing dehydration during transportation and simultaneously reducing pH in the G. I. Tract of chicks before the chicks are transferred to the brooding house. Also prevention of infection in the chicks will go a long way in protecting the health of chicks. Reduces pH of the G.I. tract of chicks reducing of the growth of pathogenic micro-organism and moulds both in water and the G.I. tract. Reduces disease incidence and cuts cost of treatment.<br><br><br>
The feed supplement is acidified for preventing infection and reducing the pH in G. I. Tract of chicks. In addition this feed supplement is enriched with ready source of energy and electrolytes. Each FEED SUPPLEMENT tray contains 60 g. of feed supplement, which is sufficient for about 15 chicks for 18-24 hours. This alone means a saving of up to 5% chicks in transit. (Costing around Rs.200 crores). Healthy chicks grow better and faster as per their genetic potential compared to the chicks that are listless weak and dehydrated.<br>
The chicks that enjoy and eat FEED SUPPLEMENT in transportation are also protected from the infection because FEED SUPPLEMENT reduces intestinal ph (acidified). The ready energy in FEED SUPPLEMENT ensures that the chicks are delivered in good health at the new poultry farm with least stress and in healthy condition.<br>
Since the composition of the inventions consist of organic acids which are from the group of Direct acting organic acids like Formic Acid, Propionic Acid, Sorbic Acid, these acids in the above mentioned inventions help in lowering the ph in the intestinal tract of the poultry chicks, as a result bacteria like e coli cannot survive in the intestinal Tract of poultry chicks Also prevention of infection in the chicks will go a long way in protecting the health of chicks.<br>
The feed supplement is acidified for preventing infection and reducing the pH in G. I. Tract of chicks. In addition this feed supplement is enriched with ready source of energy and electrolytes.<br><br>
V-\N       &gt;<br><br>
The name of the product is FEED SUPPLEMENT which helps delivery of healthy chicks to the poultry farms economically.<br>
Costly parent chicks and the chicks that are transported for long distances can be safely delivered in good health and could save money for both breeders and poultry farmers.<br><br>
\^<br><br><br>
In the case of young chicks, the pH in the 6- I Tract is still relatively high. This results in limited production of lactic acid and volatile fatty acids. This reduces the energy levels in the chicks.<br>
The invention is a feed supplement enriched with electrolytes, energy and acidified to desired pH.<br>
FEED SUPPLEMENT is supplied in disposable thermo cole trays of about 6 inches x 1 inch. Each tray contains 60 g. of FEED SUPPLEMENT . The tray is closed with detachable plastic paper cover. Bottom of each tray is provided with double adhesive tape for easy fixing in the chick box.<br>
	4<br>
FEED SUPPLEMENT is acidified with organic acids to protect chicks from infection.  It is particularly important because chicks do not have a stable microbial balance and the intestinal pH is on the higher side. Water + Electrolytes + Energy prevent dehydration and stress in chicks.<br>
The amount of water in each tray is sufficient for at least 12 hours to 18 hours for 15-18 chicks. Chicks easily pick up FEED SUPPLEMENT as the composition contains red colour. Chicks are attracted by natural instinct towards the red colour. Therefore, chicks readily consume the feed supplement which helps prevent dehydration and stress. The consumption of the said feed supplement therefore saves losses due to stress and mortality. This provides healthy head start for good growth- Once the chick receive<br><br>
34       f       A*   ^<br><br>
sufficient amounts of mineral, glucose, nutriments the immunity of the chicks also increases as well as dehydration is prevented this helps the chicks stay in good health in transit. Losses of the poultry framers are effectively reduced and farmers make more money as they are able to deliver healthy chicks.<br>
Clinical Trials<br>
With respect to the feed supplement have Deen administered where in the weight of the chicks is considered directly proportional to the dehydration or hydration in chicks.<br>
As per the research conducted at the Hebrew University in Israel demonstrated that weight loss in newly hatched chicks prior to removal from the incubator could be materially reduced by feed supplementing them on hatching trays.<br>
Observation<br>
Trial conducted on newly hatched chicks and poults showed that they lost weight at the rate of 0.14 to 0.17 grams per hour. Early hatching chicks or poults which remained on the trays for 48 hours could lose 6-8 grams when water or any feed supplement is not administered to them.<br><br><br>
In the feed supplement the edible water appears to have a promise for prevention of mortality &amp; morbidity during transportation of chicks. A trial was undertaken as follows:<br>
Objective of Trial<br>
To find out the effectiveness of the feed supplement, the same was administered for prevention of dehydration in chicks during transportation particularly in summer months.<br>
Method<br>
Two  identical chick boxes of 60 chicks each were sent to four<br>
different destinations by road transport. Out of the two chick boxes<br>
one was fixed with 4 trays of feed supplement, one tray in each<br>
compartment and the other box was used as control. Here the term<br>
control means that constitution of chicks before administration of said<br>
invention.<br>
The four destinations where the chick boxes, for trial, were sent in second week of April 2002 from Mumbai and their relative distances and time required for transit are given below :-<br><br>
SL. No.	Destination	Distance     from Mumbai	Total     time     in transit (Approx)<br>

2	Meeraj	470 km	10Hrs.<br>
3	Vadodara	400 km	8Hrs<br>
4	Hyderabad	600 km	16Hrs.<br><br><br>
Method<br>
All boxes were booked in the early morning hours between 6 AM &amp; 7 AM.<br>
The chicks were weighed before dispatch and after receipt at the poultry farm.<br>
The details of the number of chicks and average weight of chicks at the start of the transportation is as follows:-<br>

Chicks or poults in trays with feed supplement showed some initial weight loss but then tended to plateau, while those without feed supplement lost weight on a continuing linear pattern. Thus, when removed from the hatching trays and placed in growing pens, chicks or poults which had been fed were always heavier than those not fed in the hatching trays. These differences were still evident at 21 days of age.<br><br><br>
Poultry farmer received 5-7 extra chicks per box of 60 chicks.<br><br>

CONCLUSION<br>
1.	The poultry farmer gets 5 to 7 extra chicks compared to control which is 9 to 14% more than control. This is a significant Improvement in number of chicks to start with. The actual benefit will be when the farmer sells more number of finished boilers.<br>
2.	The survived chicks have 9 to 10% higher weight compared to control which is an important advantage for a healthy head start.<br>
3.	The savings in case of transportation of Breeding chicks could be several times more than the commercial chicks.<br>
(Cost of a commercial chick : Broiler Rs. 17.00 Layer Rs. 12.00<br>
4.	Cost of breeding chick is Rs. 150.00 to 170.00)<br>
Cost of one tray of FEED SUPPLEMENT to the farmer is Rs. 6.00 is sufficient for 15 chicks.<br>
It is recommended that hatcheries and farmer use FEED SUPPLEMENT as edible water during transportation of chicks to prevent dehydration and provide a healthy head start.<br><br><br>
