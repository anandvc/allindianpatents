Inhibitors of Dipeptidylpeptidase IV<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/547,227, filed February 23,2004 and 60/599,336, filed August 6,2004. The teachings of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Proteases are enzymes that cleave proteins at single, specific peptide bonds. Proteases can be classified into four generic classes: serine, thiol or cysteinyl, acid or aspartyl, and metalloproteases (Cuypers et al.9 J. Biol. Chem. 257:7086 (1982)). Proteases are essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation, and dissolution of blood clots, reproduction, and the immune reaction to foreign cells and organisms. Aberrant proteolysis is associated with a number of disease states in man and other mammals. In many instances, it is beneficial to disrupt the function of one or more proteolytic enzymes in the course of therapeutically treating an animal.<br>
The binding site for a peptide substrate consists of a series of “specificity subsites” across the surface of the enzyme. The term “specificity subsite” refers to a pocket or other site on the enzyme capable of interacting with a portion of a substrate for the enzyme. In discussing the interactions of peptides with proteases, e.g., serine and cysteine proteinases, and the like, the present application utilizes the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger s [(1967) Biochem. Biophvs. Res. Commun. 27:157-162)]. The individual amino acid residues of a substrate or inhibitor are designated PI, P2, etc. and the corresponding subsites of the enzyme are designated SI, S2, etc, starting with the carboxy terminal residue produced in the cleavage reaction. The scissile bond of the substrate is the amide bond between PI-PI1 of the substrate. Thus, for a peptide Xaal-Xaa2-Xaa3-Xaa4 which is cleaved between the Xaa3 and Xaa4 residues, the Xaa3 residue is referred to as the PI residue and binds to the SI subsite of the enzyme, Xaa2 is referred to as the P2 residue and binds to the S2 subsite, and so forth.<br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV), for example, is a serine protease which cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from a peptide chain containing, preferably, a proline residue in the<br><br>
penultimate position, e.g., in the PI position. DPIV belongs to a group of cell-membrane-associated peptidases and, like the majority of cell-surface peptidases, is a type n integral membrane protein, being anchored to the plasma membrane by its signal sequence. DPIV is found in a variety of differentiated mammalian epithelia, endothelia and hematopoetic cells and tissues, including those of lymphoid origin where it is found specifically on the surface of CD4 T ceils. DPIV has been identified as the leukocyte differentiation marker CD26.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
I. Overview<br>
The present invention relates to inhibitors of post-proline cleaving enzymes (PPCE), such as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, as well as pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods for using such inhibitors. The.prototype of these molecules has an acidic amino acid and an electrophilic site carrying a variety of side chains.<br>
Salient features for compounds of the present invention include: better therapeutic indices, owing in part to reduced toxicity and/or improved specificity for the targeted protease; better oral availability; increased shelf-life; and/or increased duration of action (such as single oral dosage formulations which are effective for more than 4 hours, and even more preferably for more than 8,12, or 16 hours).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used as part of treatments for a variety of disorders/conditions, such as those which are mediated by DPIV. For instance, the subject inhibitors can be used to up-regulate GIP and GLP-1 activities, e.g., by<br><br>
increasing the half-life of those hormones, as part of a treatment for regulating glucose levels and/or metabolism, e.g., to reduce insulin resistance, treat hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperlipoproteinemia (such as chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL), and to regulate body fat and more generally lipid stores, and, more generally, for the improvement of metabolism disorders, especially those associated with diabetes, obesity and/or atherosclerosis.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is observed that compounds which inhibit DPIV are, correlatively, able to improve glucose tolerance, though not necessarily through mechanisms involving DPIV inhibition per se. Indeed, similar compounds have bee? ‘ sown to be effective in mice lacking a GLP-1 receptor suggesting that the subject method may not include a mechanism of action directly implicating GLP-1 itself, though it has not been ruled out that GLP-1 may have other receptors. However, in light of the correlation with DPIV inhibition, in preferred embodiments, the subject method utilizes an agent with a K,- for DPIV inhibition of 50.0 nm or less, more preferably of 10.0 nm or less, and even more preferably of 1.0,0.1, or even 0.01 nM or less. Indeed, inhibitors with Ki values in the picomolar and even femtomolar range are contemplated. Thus, while the active agents are described herein, for convenience, as “DPIV inhibitors”, it will be understood that such nomenclature is not intending to limit the subject invention to a particular mechanism of action.<br>
Certain of the subject compounds have extended duration. Accordingly, in certain preferred embodiments, the inhibitors) is selected, and the amount of inhibitor formulated, to provide a dosage which inhibits serum PPCE (e.g., DPIV) levels by at least 50 percent for at least 4 hours after a single dose, and even more preferably for at least 8 hours or even 12 or 16 hours after a single dose.<br>
For instance, in certain embodiments the method involves administration of a DPIV inhibitor, preferably at a predetermined time(s) during a 24-hour period, in an amount effective to improve one or more aberrant indices associated wife glucose metabolism disorders (e.g., glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and Type I and II diabetes).<br>
In other embodiments, the method involves administration of a DPIV inhibitor in an amount effective to improve aberrant indices associated with obesity. Fat cells release the hormone leptin, which travels in the bloodstream to the brain and, through leptin<br><br>
receptors there, stimulates production of GLP-1. GLP-1, in turn, produces the sensation of being full. Tlie leading theory is that the fat cells of most obese people probably produce enough leptin, but leptin may not be able to properly engage the leptin receptors in the brain, and so does not stimulate production of GLP-1. There is accordingly a great deal of research towards utilizing preparations of GLP-1 as an appetite suppressant The subject method provides a means for increasing the half-life of both endogenous and ectopically added GLP-1 in the treatment of disorders associated with ot,esity.<br>
In a more general sense, the present invention provides methods and compositions for altering the phannacokinetics of a variety of different pol,peptide hormones by inhibiting the proteolysis of one or more peptide hormones by DPIV or some other proteolytic activity. Post-secretory metabolism is an important element in the overall homeostasis of regulatory peptides, and the other enzymes inrvolved in these processes may be suitable targets for pharmacological intervention by the subject method.<br>
For example, the subject method can be used to increase the half-life of other proglucagon-derived peptides, such as glicentin (corresponding to PG 1-69), oxyntomodulin (PG 33-69), glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP, PG 1-30), interveningpeptide-2 (IP-2, PG lll-122amide), and glucagozn-like peptide-2 (GLP-2, PG 126-158).<br>
GLP-2, for example, has been identified as a factor responsible for inducing proliferation of intestinal epithelium. See, for example, Drucker et al. (1996) PNAS 93:7911. The subject method can be used as part of a regimen for treating injury, inflammation or resection of intestinal tissue, e.g., where entranced growth and repair of the intestinal mucosal epithelial is desired, such as in the trea-tment of Crohn’s disease or Inflammatory Bowel Disease (EBD).<br>
DPIV has also been implicated in the metabolism and. inactivation of growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF). GHRF is a member of the family of homologous peptides that includes glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), and helodermin (Kubiak et al. (199-4) Peptide Res 7:153). GHRF is secreted by the hypothalamus, and stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. Thus, the subject method can be used to improve clinical therapy for certain growth hormone deficient children, and in clinical therapy of adults to improve<br><br>
nutrition and to alter body composition (muscle vs. fat). The subject method can also be used m veterinary practice, for example, to develop higher yield milk production and higher yield, leaner livestock.<br>
Likewise, the DPIV inhibitors of the subject invention can be used to alter the plasma half-life of secretin, VIP, PHI, PACAP, GIP, and/or helodermin. Additionally, the subject method can be used to alter the pharmacokinetics of Peptide YY and neuropeptide v voth members of the pancreatic polypeptide family, as DPIV has been implicated in the pi vwc,--i*ag of those peptides in a manner which alters receptor selectivity.<br>
In other embodiments, the subject inhibitors can be used to stimulate hematopoiesis.<br>
In still other embodiments, the subject inhibitors can be used to inhibit growth or vascularization of transformed cells/tissues, e.g., to inhibit cell proliferation such as that associated with tumor growth and metastasis, and for inhibiting angiogenesis in an abnormal proliferative cell mass.<br>
In yet other embodiments, the subject inhibitors can be used to reduce immunological responses, e.g., as an immunosuppressant<br>
In yet other examples, the DPIV inhibitors according to the present invention can be used to treat CNS maladies such as strokes, tumors, ischemia, Parkinson’s disease, memory loss, hearing loss, vision loss, migraines, brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (which has a CNS component). Additionally, the DPIV inhibitors can be used to treat disorders having a more peripheral nature, including multiple sclerosis and diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of the subject post-proline cleaving enzyme inhibitors, particularly DPIV inhibitors, and their uses in treating and/or preventing disorders which can be improved by altering the homeostasis of peptide hormones. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitors have hypoglycemic and antidiabetic activities, and can be used in the treatment of disorders marked by aberrant glucose metabolism (including storage). In particular embodiments, the compositions of the subject methods are useful as insulinotropic agents, or to potentiate the insulinotropic effects of such molecules as GLP-1. In this regard, certain embodiments of the present compositions can be useful for the treatment and/or<br><br>
prophylaxis of a variety of disorders, including one or more of: hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, glucose tolerance insufficiency, insulin resistance, and diabetic complications.<br>
In general, the inhibitors of the subject method are small molecules, e.g., with molecular weights less than 7500 amu, preferably less than 5000 amu, and even more preferably less than 2000 or even less than 1000 amu. In preferred embodiments, the inhibitors are orally active.<br>

The term “LD50” means the dose of a drug that is lethal in 50% of test subjects.<br>
The term “prophylactic or therapeutic” treatment is art-recognized and includes administration to the host of one or more of the subject compositions. If it is administered prior to clinical manifestation of the unwanted condition (e.g., disease or other unwanted state of the host animal) then the treatment is prophylactic, (i.e., it protects the host against developing the unwanted condition), whereas if it is administered after manifestation of the unwanted condition, the treatment is therapeutic, (i.e., it is intended to diminish, ameliorate, or stabilize the existing unwanted condition or side effects thereof).<br>

The term amino acid residue further includes analogs, derivatives and congeners of any specific amino acid referred to herein, as well as C-terminal or N-terminal protected amino acid derivatives (e.g. modified with an N-terminal or C-terminal protecting group). For example, the present invention contemplates the use of amino acid analogs wherein a<br><br>
side chain is lengthened or shortened while still providing a carboxyl, amino or other reactive precursor functional group for cyclization, as well as amino acid analogs having variant side chains with appropriate functional groups). For instance, the subject compound can include an amino acid analog such as, for example, cyanoalanine, canavanine, djenkolic acid, norleucine, 3-phosphoserine, homoserine, dihydroxy-phenylalanine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidines diaminopimelic acid, ornithine, or diaminobutyric acid.

It is to be understood accordingly that the isomers arising from such asymmetry are included within the scope of this invention. Such isomers can be obtained in substantially pure form by classical separation techniques and by sterically controlled synthesis. For the purposes of this application, unless expressly noted to the contrary, a named amino acid shall be construed to include both the (D) and (L) stereoisomers.<br>
The phrase “protecting group” as used herein means substituents which protect the reactive functional group from undesirable chemical reactions. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids andboronic acids, ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones. For instance, the phrase “N-tenninal protecting group” or “amino-protecting group” as used herein refers to various amino-protecting groups which can be employed to protect the N-terminus of an amino acid or peptide against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures. Examples of suitable groups include acyl protecting groups such as, to illustrate, formyl, dansyl, acetyl, benzoyl, trifluoroacetyl, succinyl, and methoxysuccinyl; aromatic urethane protecting groups as, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz); and aliphatic urethane protecting groups such as t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).<br><br>
As noted above, certain compounds of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. In certain embodiments where a particular enantiomer is preferred, a compound of the present invention is enriched to have ,60%, ,70%, ,80%, ,90%, ,95%, or even greater than 98% or 99% of the preferred enantiomer, as opposed to a racemate where the two enantiomers each are present to the extent of 50%.<br>
If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomer. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomer.<br>

In certain preferred embodiments, the subject inhibitors are DPIV inhibitors with a Kj for DPIV inhibition of 10 nm or less, more preferably of 1.0 nm or less, and even more preferably of 0.1 or even 0.01 nM or less. Indeed, inhibitors with Kj values in the picomolar and even femtomolar range are contemplated.<br>
In general, the inhibitors of the subject method are small molecules, e.g., with molecular weights less than 7500 amu, preferably less than 5000 amu, and even more preferably less than 2000 amu and even less than 1000 amu. In preferred embodiments, the inhibitors are orally active.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions of dipeptidylpeptidase inhibitors, particularly inhibitors) and their uses in treating and/or preventing disorders which can be improved by altering the homeostasis of peptide hormones. In a preferred embodiment, the inhibitors have hypoglycemic and antidiabetic activities, and can be used in the treatment of disorders marked by aberrant glucose metabolism (including storage). In particular embodiments, the compositions of the subject methods are useful as insulinotropic agents, or to potentiate the insulinotropic effects of such molecules as GLP-1. In this regard, the present method can be useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of a variety of disorders, including one or more of: hyperlipemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, glucose tolerance insufficiency, insulin resistance, and diabetic complications.<br>
For instance, in certain embodiments the method involves administration of an inhibitor(s), preferably at a predetermined interval(s) during a 24-hour period, in an amount effective to improve one or more aberrant indices associated with glucose metabolism disorders (e.g., glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,<br><br>
hyperinsulinemia, and Type II diabetes). The effective amount of the inhibitor may be about 0.01, 0.1,1,10, 30, 50, 70,100,150,200, 500, ox 1000 mg/kg of the subject<br>
(ii). Agonism ofGLP-1 effects<br>
The inhibitors useful in the subject methods possess, in certain embodiments, the ability to lower blood glucose levels, to relieve obesity., to alleviate impaired glucose tolerance, to inhibit hepatic glucose neogenesis, and to lower blood lipid levels and to inhibit aldose reductase. They are thus useful for the prevention and/or therapy of hyperglycemia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetic complications (including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cataracts, coronary artery disease and arteriosclerosis), and furthermore for obesity-related hypertension and osteoporosis.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by hiyperglycemia occurring from a relative or absolute decrease in insulin secretion, decreased insulin sensitivity, or insulin resistance. The morbidity and mortality of this disease result from vascular, renal, and neurological complications. An oral glucose tolerance test is a clinical test used to diagnose diabetes. In an oral glucose tolerance test, a patient’s physiological response to a glucose load or challenge is evaluated. After ingesting the glucose, the patient’s physiological response to the glucose challenge is evaluated. Generally, this is accomplished by determining the patient’s blood gluco se levels (the concentration of glucose in the patient’s plasma, serum, or whole blood) for several predetermined points in time.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for agonizing the action of GLP-1. It has been determined that isoforms of GLP-1 (GLP-1(7-37) and GLP-1(7-36)), which are derived from preproglucagon in the intestine and the hind brain, have insulinotropic activity, i.e., they modulate glucose metabolism. DPIV cleaves the isoforms to inactive peptides. Thus, in certain embodiments, inhibitor(s) of the present invention can agonize insulinotropic activity by interfexing with the degradation of bioactive GLP-1 peptides.<br>
(Hi). Agonism of the effects of other peptide hormones<br>
In another embodiment, the subject agents can be used to agonize (e.g., mimic or potentiate) the activity of peptide hormones, e.g., GLP—2, GIP and NPY.<br><br>
To illustrate farther, the present invention provides a method for agonizing the action of GLP-2. It has been determined that GLP-2 acts as a trophic agent, to promote growth of gastrointestinal tissue. The effect of GLP-2 is marked particularly by increased growth of the small bowel, and is therefore herein referred to as an “intestinotrophic” effect DPIV is known to cleave GLT-- into a biologically inactive peptide. Thus, in one embodiment, inhibition of DPIV interferes with the degradation of GLP-2, and thereby increases the plasma half-life of that hormone.<br>
In still other embodiments, the subject method can be used to increase the half-life of other proglucagon-derived peptides, such as glicentin, oxyntomodulin, glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (GRPP), and/or intervening peptide-2 (IP-2). For example, glicentin has been demonstrated to cause proliferation of intestinal mucosa and also inhibits a peristalsis of the stomach, and has thus been elucidated as useful as a therapeutic agent for digestive tract diseases, thus leading to the present invention.<br>
Thus, in one aspect, the present invention relates to therapeutic and related uses of inhibitor(s) for promoting the growth and proliferation of gastrointestinal tissue, most particularly small boWel tissue. For instance, the subject method can be used as part of a regimen for treating injury, inflammation, or resection of intestinal tissue, e.g., where enhanced growth and repair of the intestinal mucosal epithelial is desired.<br>
With respect to small bowel tissue, such growth is measured conveniently as an increase in small bowel mass and length, relative to an untreated control. The effect of subject inhibitors on small bowel also manifests as an increase in the height of the crypt s plus villus axis. Such activity is referred to herein as an “intestinotrophic” activity. The efficacy of the subject method may also be detectable as an increase in crypt cell proliferation and/or a decrease in small bowel epithelium apoptosis. These cellular effects may be noted most significantly in relation to the jejunum, including the distal jejunum and particularly the proximal jejunum, and also in the distal ileum. A compound is considered to have “intestinotrophic effect” if a test animal exhibits significantly increased small bowel weight, increased height of the crypt plus villus axis or increased crypt cell proliferation, or decreased small bowel epithelium apoptosis when treated with the compound (or genetically engineered to express it themselves). A model suitable for determining such gastrointestinal growth is described by US Patent 5,834,428.<br>
i<br><br>
In general, patients who would benefit from either increased small intestinal mass and consequent increased small bowel mucosal function are candidates for treatment by the subject method. Particular conditions that may be treated include the various forms of sprue, including celiac sprue which results from a toxic reaction to a-gliadin from wheat, and is marked by a tremendous loss of villae of the bowel; tropical sprue which results from infection and is marked by partial flattening of the villae; hypogammaglobulinemic sprue which is observed commonly in patients with common variable immunodeficiency or hypogammaglobulinemia and is marked by significant d&amp;crease in villus height. The therapeutic efficacy of the treatment may be monitored by emteric biopsy to examine the villus morphology, by biochemical assessment of nutrient afcsorption, by patient weight gain, or by amelioration of the symptoms associated with these conditions. Other conditions that may be treated by the subject method, or for which the subject method may be useful prophylactically, include radiation enteritis, infectious or post-infectious enteritis, regional enteritis (Crohn’s disease), small intestinal damage due to toxic or other chemotherapeutic agents, and patients with short bowel syndrome.<br>
More generally, the present invention provides a thexapeutic method for treating digestive tract diseases. The term “digestive tract” as used tierein means a tube through which food passes, including stomach and intestine. The term “digestive tract diseases” as used herein means diseases accompanied by a qualitative or quantitative abnormality in the digestive tract mucosa, which include, e.g., ulceric or indflammatory disease; congenital or acquired digestion and absorption disorder including mal absorption syndrome; disease caused by loss of a mucosal barrier function of the gut; and protein-losing gastroenteropathy. The ulceric disease includes, e.g., gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, small intestinal ulcer, colonic ulcer, and rectal ulcer. The inflammatory disease include, e.g., esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, enteritis, colitis, Crohn’s disease, proctitis, gastrointestinal Behcet, radiation enteritis, radiation colitis, radiation proctitis, enteritis, and medicamentosa. The malabsorption syndrome includes the essential malabsorption syndrome such as disaccharide-decomposing enzyme deficiency, glucose-galactose malabsorption, fructose malabsorption; secondary malabsorption syndrome, e.g., the disorder caused by a mucosal atrophy in the digestive tract through the intravenous or parenteral nutrition or elemental diet, the disease caused by the resection and shunt of the small intestine such as short gut syndrome, cul-de-sac syndrome; and indigestible<br><br>
malabsorption syndrotnes such as the disease caused by resection of the stomach, e.g., dumping syndrome.<br>
The term “therapeutic agent for digestive tract diseases” as used herein means the agents for the prevention and treatment of the digestive tract diseases, which include, e.g., the therapeutic agent for digestive tract ulcer, the therapeutic agent for inflammatory digestive tract disease, the therapeutic agent for mucosal atrophy in the digestive tract, the therapeutic agent for a digestive tract wound, the amelioration agent for the function of the digestive tract including the agent for recovery of the mucosal barrier function, and the amelioration agent for digestive and absorptive function. Ulcers include digestive ulcers and erosions, and acute ulcers, namely acute mucosal lesions.<br>
The subject method, because of promoting proliferation of intestinal mucosa, can be used in the treatment and prevention of pathologic conditions of insufficiency in digestion and absorption, that is, treatment and prevention of mucosal atrophy, or treatment of hypoplasia of the digestive tract tissues and decrease in these tissues by surgical removal as well as impro ment of digestion and absorption. Further, the subject method can be used in the treatment of pathologic mucosal conditions due to inflammatory diseases such as enteritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulceric colitis and also in the treatment of reduction in function of the digestive tract after operation, for example, in damping syndrome as well as in the treatment of duodenal ulcer in conjunction with the inhibition of peristalsis of the stomach and rapid migration of food from the stomach to the jejunum. Furthermore, glicentin can effectively be used in promoting cure of surgical invasion as well as in improving functions of the digestive tract Thus, the present invention also provides a therapeutic agent for atrophy of the digestive tract mucosa, a therapeutic agent for wounds in the digestive tract and a drug for improving functions of the digestive tract which comprise glicentin as active ingredients.<br>
Likewise, the inhibitors) of the subject invention can be used to alter the plasma half-life of secretin, VIP, PHI, PACAP, GEP, and/or helodermin. Additionally, the subject method can be used to alter the pharmacokinetics of Peptide YY and neuropeptide Y, both members of the pancreatic polypepride family, as DPIV has been implicated in the processing of those peptides in a manner which alters receptor selectivity.<br>
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is believed to act in the regulation vascular smooth muscle tone, as well as regulation of blood pressure. NPY also decreases cardiac contractility.<br><br>
NPY is also the most powerful appetite stimulant known (Wilding et al., (1992) J Endocrinology 132:299-302). The centrally evoked food intake (appetite stimulation) effect is predominantly mediated by NPY Yl receptors and causes increase in body fat stores and obesity (Stanley et al., (1989) Physiology and Behavior 46:173-177).<br>
According to the present invention, a method for treatment of anorexia comprises administering to a host subject an effective amount of an inhibitors) to stimulate the appetite and increase body fat stores which thereby substantially relieves the symptoms of anorexia.<br>
A method for treatment of hypotension comprises administering to a host subject an effective amount of an inhibitors) of the present invention to mediate vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure which thereby substantially relieves the symptoms of hypotension.<br>
DPIV has also been implicated in the metabolism and inactivation of growth hormone-releasing factor (GHRF). GHRF is a member of the family of homologous peptides that includes glucagon, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and helodermin (Kubiak et al. (1994) Peptide Res 7:153). GHRF is secreted by the hypothalamus, and stimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary. Thus, the subject method can be used to improve clinical therapy for certain growth hormone deficient children, and in clinical therapy of adults to improve nutrition and to alter body composition (muscle vs. fat). The subject method can also be v used in veterinary practice, for example, to develop higher yield milk production and higher yield, leaner livestock.<br>
(iv). Assays oflnsulinotropic Activity<br>
In selecting a compound suitable for use in the subject method, it is noted that the insulinotropic property of a compound may be determined by providing that compound to animal cells, or injecting that compound into animals and monitoring the release of immunoreactive insulin (TRI) into the media or circulatory system of the animal, respectively. The presence of IRI can be detected through the use of a radioimmunoassay which can specifically detect insulin.<br><br>

The db/db mouse develops hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia concomitant with its development of obesity and thus serves as a model of obese type 2 diabetes (NIDDM). The db/db mice can be purchased from, for example, The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbon:, Me.). In an exemplary embodiment, for treatment of the mice with a regimen including an inhibitors) or control, sub-orbital sinus blood samples are taken before and at some time (e.g., 60 minutes) after dosing of each animal. Blood glucose measurements can be made by any of several conventional techniques, such as using a glucose meter. The blood- glucose levels f the control and inhibitors) dosed animals are compared<br>
The metabolic fate of exogenous GLP-1 can also be followed in both nondiabetic or type n diabetic subjects, and the effect of a candidate inhibitor(s) determined. For instance, a combination of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), specific radioimmunoassays (RIAs), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), can be used, whereby intact biologically active GLP-1 and its metabolites can be detected. See, for example, Deacon et al. (1995) Diabetes 44:1126-1131. To illustrate, after GLP-1 administration, the intact peptide can be measured using an NH2-terminally directed RIA or ELISA, while the difference in concentration between these assays and a COOH-tenninal-specific RIA allowed determination of NEb-terminally truncated metabolites. Without inhibitor, subcutaneous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in a time-dependent manner, forming a metabolite which co-elutes on HPLC with GLP-I(9-36) amide and has the same immunoreactive profile. For instance, thirty minutes after subcutaneous GXP-1 administration to diabetic patients (n = 8), the metabolite accounted for 88.5 + 1.9% of the increase in plasma immunoreactivity determined by the COOH-terminal RILA, which was higher than the levels measured in healthy subjects (78.4 4- 3.2%; n - 8; P , 0.05). See Deacon et al., supra. Intravenously infused GLP-I was also extensively degraded.<br>
(v). Conjoint administration<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a conjoint therapy wherein one or more other therapeutic agents are administered with the protease inhibitor. Such, conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential, or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.<br>
In one embodiment, an inhibitors) is conjointly administered with insulin or other insulinotropic agents, such as GLP-1, peptide hormones, such as GLP-2, GrIP, or NPY, or<br><br>
a gene therapy vector which causes the ectopic expression of said agents and peptide hormones. In certain embodiments, said agents or peptide hormones may be variants of a naturally occurring or synthetic peptide hormone, wherein one or more amino acids have been added, deleted, or substituted.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, the subject inhibitors can be conjointly administered with an Ml receptor antagonist. Cholinergic agents are potent modulators of insulin release that act via muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the use of such agents can have the added benefit of decreasing cholesterol levels, while increasing HDL levels. Suitable muscarinic receptor antagonists include substances that directly or indirectly block activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Preferably, such substances are selective (or are used in amounts that promote such selectivity) for the Ml receptor. Nonlimiting examples include quaternary amines (such as methantheline, ipratropium, and propantheline), tertiary amines (e.g. dicyclomine and scopolamine), and tricyclic amines (e.g. telenzepine). Pirenzepine and methyl scopolamine are preferred. Other suitable muscarinic receptor antagonists include benztropine (commercially available as COGENTTN from Merck), hexahydro-sila-difenidol hydrochloride (HHSID hydrochloride disclosed in Lambrecht et al. (1989) Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 10(Suppl):60; (+/- )-3-quinuclidinyl xanthene-9-carboxylate hemioxalate (QNX-hemioxalate; Birdsall et al., Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 4:459,1983; telenzepine dihydrochloride (Coruzzi et al. (1989) Arch. Int. Pharmacodvn. Ther. 302:232; and Kawashima et al. (1990) Gen. Pharmacol. 21:17), and atropine. The dosages of such muscarinic receptor antagonists will be generally subject to optimization as outlined above. In the case of lipid metabolism disorders, dosage optimization may be necessary independent of whether administration is timed by reference to the lipid metabolism responsiveness window or not.<br>
In terms of regulating insulin and lipid metabolism and reducing the foregoing disorders, the subject inhibitor(s) may also act synergistically with prolactin inhibitors such as d2 dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine). Accordingly, the subject method can include the conjoint administration of such prolactin inhibitors as prolactin-irihibiting ergo alkaloids and prolactin-inhibiting dopamine agonists. Examples of suitable compounds include 2-bromo-alpha-ergocriptine, 6-methyl-8 beta-carbobenzyloxyaminoethyl-10-alpha-ergoline, 8-acylaminoergolines, 6-methyl-8-alpha-(N-acyl)amino-9-ergoline, 6-methyl-8-alpha-(N-phenylacetyl)amino-9-ergoline, ergocornine, 9,10-dihydroergocornine,<br><br>
D-2-halo-6-alkyl-8-substitutedergolines, D-2-bromo-6-methyl-8-cyanomethylergoline, carbidopa, benserazide, and other dopadecarboxyiase inhibitors, L-dopa, dopamine, and non toxic salts thereof.<br>
The inhibitors) used according to the invention can also be used conjointly with agents acting on the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the p-cells, such as glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide, and AG-EE 623 ZW. The inhibitors) may also advantageously be applied in combination with other oral agents such as metformin and elated c ,pounds or glucosidase inhibitors as, for example, acarbose.<br>
(vi). Phaiinaceutical Compositions<br>
Inhibitors prepared as described herein can be administered in various forms, depending on the disorder to be treated and the age, condition, and body weight of the patient, as is well known in the art. For example, where the compounds are to be administered orally, they may be formulated as tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or syrups; or for parenteral administration, they may be formulated as injections (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), drop infusion preparations, or suppositories. For application by the ophthalmic mucous membrane route, they may be formulated as eye drops or eye ointments. These formulations can be prepared by conventional means, and, if desired, the active ingredient may be mixed with any conventional additive, such as an excipient, a binder, a disintegrating agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a solubilizing agent, a suspension aid, an emulsifying agent, or a coating agent. Although the dosage will vary depending on the symptoms, age and body weight of the patient, the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated or prevented, the route of administration and the form of the drug, in general, a daily dosage of from 0,01 to 2000 mg of the compound is recommended for an adult human patient, and this may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses.<br>
The precise time of administration and/or amount of the inhibitor that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of treatment in a given patient will depend upon the activity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of a particular compound, physiological condition of the patient (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), route of administration, etc. However, the above guidelines can be used as the basis for fine-tuning<br><br>
the treatment, e.g., determining the optimum time and/or amount of administration, which will require no more than routine experimentation consisting of monitoring the subject and adjusting the dosage and/or timing.<br>
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those ligands, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material.

In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are non-pyrogenic, i.e., do not induce significant temperature elevations when administered to a patient.<br>
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the inhibitors). These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the inhibitor(s), or by separately reacting a purified inhibitors) in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed.

In other cases, the inhibitors useful in the methods of the present invention may uain one or more acidic functional groves and, thus, are capable of forming piidii .taceutically acceptable salts with	aceutically acceptable bases. The term<br>
“pharmaceutically acceptable salts’* in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic inorganic and organic base addition salts of an inhibitors). These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the inhibitors), or by separately reacting the purified inhibitors) in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts, and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include efhylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., supra).<br>
Wetting agents, emulsifiers, and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening,<br>
flavoring, and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions.<br>
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.<br>
Formulations useful in the methods of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, aerosol, and/or<br><br>
parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with, a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred per cent, this amount will range from about 1 per cent to about niixety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 per cent to about 70 per cent, most preferably from about 10 per cent to about 30 per cent<br>
Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association an inhibitors) with the carrier a.nd, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a ligand with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes, and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an inhibitor(s) as an active ingredient. A compound may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
In solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pynrolidone, sucrose, and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as<br><br>

A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered peptide or peptidomimetic moistened with an inert liquid diluent<br>
Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills, and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes, and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the<br><br>
active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, soluhilizing agents, and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, “benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofiiryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also inclu.de adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming, and preservative agents.<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active inhibitors) may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more inhibitors) with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent.<br>
Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration, also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of an inhibitor(s) include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches, and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, t,uffers, or propellants which may be required.<br>
The ointments, pastes, creams, and gels may contain, in addition to inhibitors), excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to an inhibitors), excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.<br>
The inhibitors) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation, or solid particles containing the compound. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound.<br>
Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular compound, but typically fec,ide nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins Li.3 serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars, or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an inhibitors) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the inhibitors) across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the peptidomimetic in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions, and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more inhibitors(s) in combination with one or more phaxmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants,<br><br>
buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate, of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of inhibitor(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.<br><br>
When the inhibitors(s) of the present invention are administered as Pharmaceuticals to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 0.5 to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The preparations of agents may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, * n-tment. suppository, infusion; topically by lotion or ointment; and rectally by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradeimal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection, and infusion.<br>
The phrases “systemic administration,” “administered systemically,” “peripheral administration” and “administered peripherally” as used herein mean the administration of a ligand, drug, or other material other than directly into the central nervous system., such that it enters the patient’s system and thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration.<br>
These inhibitors(s) may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy s by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for exampLe, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally, and topically, as by po~wders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.<br>
Regardless of the route of administration selected, the inhibitor(s), which may be ised in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional nethods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions ,f this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is<br><br>
effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient<br>
/F. Exemplification<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.<br>
Example 1: DPIVInhibition Assay<br>
The inhibitor solution was prepared by dissolving 3-5 mg of inhibitor in pH 2 solution (0.01 N HC1), such that the concentration of the solution was equal to 1 mg/10 (LLL. A 10 \xL sample of this solution was then added to 990 pL of pH 8 buffer (0.1 M HEPES, 0.14 M NaCl), and the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight.<br>
The enzyme solution was prepared by diluting 20 p,L of DPIV (concentration 2.5 pM) into 40 mL of pH 8 buffer.<br>
The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 2.0 mg of L-alanyl-L-proline-/7am-nitroanilide into 20 mL of pH 8 buffer.<br>
250 pL of enzyme solution was added to well #B1 to #H1, #A2 to #H2, and #A3 to #H3 of a 96 well plate, while well #A1 received 250 pL of pH 8 buffer instead of enzyme solution. 90pL of pH 8 buffer was then added to column 5 (from well #A5 to #H5).<br>
A 1:10 dilution was then performed by adding inhibitor solution to #A5 and the solution was mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #A5 to #B5. The solution in #B5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #B5 to #C5. The solution in #C5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #C5 to #D5. The solution in #D5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #D5 to #E5. The solution in #E5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #E5 to #F5. The solution in #F5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #F5 to #G5. The solution in #G5 was then mixed well before transferring 10 pL of this solution from #G5 to #H5.<br><br>
A 30 jiL aliquot was then transferred from #H5 to #H3 for row H, and the contents were mixed well. The analogous procedure was repeated for rows G, F, E, D, C, B, and A sequentially. The plate was then shaken on a plate shaker for 5 minutes before allowing the plate to incubate at room temperature for an additional 5 minutes.<br>
Once the plate had been allowed to incubate, 30 \xL of substrate was added to eacfci well except well #A1. The plate was then placed on a plate shaker for 5 minutes before allowing the plate to incubate at room temperature for 25 minutes. The absorbance was then immediately read at a wavelength of 410 nm.<br>
Using the assay described above, the IC50 of Glu-boroAla at pH 8 was determine! to be 72 nM, the IC50 of Glu-boroPro was determined to be 2.4 pM, and the IC50 of the Glu-boroEtg was determined to be 49 nM.<br>
Example 2; Synthesis ofL-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro] (I)<br>
The synthesis of L-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro] is illustrated in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Reagents and conditions: i) Boc2O, NaH, THF, r.t, 94%; ii) L1BH4, THF, -10°C, 87%; iii) DHP, TsOH, CH2C12, 96%; iv) LiTMP, B(OMe)3, THF, -78°C, then HC1; v) H2/Pt-C, EtOAc; vi) (+)-Pinanediol, Et2O, 60% yield over three steps; vii) 4 N HC1 in dioxane, 60%; viii) N-Boc-L-boroAla-OH, HATU, DIPEA, DMF, 0°C to r.t, 76%; ix) BC13, CH2C123 -78°C, 50%.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Starting from commercially available pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 1, synthesis of L-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro](I) was achieved via nine steps in an overall yield of 17%. First, pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 1 was deprotonated with sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran and then reacted with di-fert-butyl dicarbonate to give N-Boc-pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 2 (see Tietze, et ah Synthesis of N-protected 2-hydroxymethylpyrroles and transformation into acyclic oligomers. Synthesis (1996), 7:851-857). Reduction of the carbaldehyde 2 with lithium borohydride at »10°C yielded the hydroxymethyl compound 3. The<br><br>
hydroxylmethyl group of compound 3 was then protected with a tetrahydropyranyl group to form the THP ether 4. Total yield of the first three steps was 78%, with purification by silica gel flash chromatography at each step. The protected pyrrole was deprotonated with LiTMP (generated from n-butyl lithium and tetramethylpiperidine in THF at -78°C) (see Kelly, et al. The efficient synthesis and simple resolution of a prolineboronate ester suitable for enzyme-inhibition studies. Tetrahedron (1993), 49(5): 1009-16) and quenched with trimethyl borate, then HC1 was added to hydrolyze the dimethyl boronate to give the boronic acid 5. Without further purification, compound 5 was hydrogenated over 5% Pt/C in ethyl acetate to afford pyrrolidine-2-boronic acid 6. Crude 6 was stirred with 1.05eq. (•f)-pinanediol in ether at room temperature and then purified by silica gel flash chromatography to yield the protected 5-hydroxymethylboroPro pinanediol ester 7 in 60% yield over these three steps. Removal of the te7”*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group with 4 N HC1 in dioxane gave intermediate compound 8 in a yield of 94%. Compound 8 was coupled with N-Boc-L-Ala-OH in the presence of HATU and DIPEA, then the Boc and pinane protecting groups were deprotected with BCI3 to give the target dipeptide boronate I in a 38% yield over the last two steps.<br>

Reagents and conditions: i: Boc2O, NEt3s DMAP, CH2C12, 93%; ii: s-BuLi, TMEDA, (i-PrO)3B, THF, -78°C, then NaOH; iii: (+)-Pinanediol9 Et20,74% for the two steps; iv: 4 N<br><br>
HC1 in dioxane, 88%; v: N-Boc-L-boroAla-OH, HATU, DEPEA, DMF, 0°C to r.t, 85%; vi: BC13, CH2CI2, -78°C, 70%.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
L-Ala-5-Me-boroPro(II) was synthesized from commercially available 2-methylpyrrolidine, as shown in Scheme 2. First, 2-methylpyrrolidine was reacted with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of triethylamine and DMAP to give N-Boc-pyrrolidine 1. The C-lithiation of N-Boc-pyrrolidine was achieved using s-BuLi (2.2equiv.) in THF-TMEDA (see Gibson, et al. A Practical Synthesis of L-Valyl-pyrrolidine-(2R)-boronic Acid: Efficient Recycling of the Costly Chiral Auxiliary (+)-Pinanediol. Organic Process Research &amp; Development (2002), 6(6): 814-816.) at -78°C and then quenched by triisopropyl borate. After workup with NaOH and then HC1, the crude boronic acid was protected with (+)-pinanediol. The pure boronate compound 2 was then obtained in a yield of 51% over two steps after purification with silica gel flash chromatography. Removal of the terMmtoxycarbonyl (Boc) group with 4 N HC1 in dioxane gave the intermediates 5-methylboroPro pinanediol ester 3. Compound 3 was coupled with N-Boc-X-Ala-OH in the presence of HATU and DIPEA, then the Boc and pinane protecting groups were removed with BCI3 to give the target dipeptide boronate II in a 60% yield over the last two steps.<br>
Example 4: Synthesis ofL-Ala-cis-boroHyp (III) and Ala-trans-boroHyp (IV)<br>
The syntheses of L-Ala-czs-boroHyp and AIa-,a?tf-boroHyp are illustrated in Scheme 3.<br><br><br>
Reagents and conditions: i: s-BuLi, 1MEDA, (i-PrO)3B, THF, -78°C, then NaOH; ii: (+)-Pinanediol, Et2O, 51%; iii: 4 N HC1 in dioxane, 90-93%; iv: N-Boc-L-boroAla-OH, HATU, DIPEA, DMF, 0°C to r.t, 80-85%; v: BC13, CH2C12, -78°C, 50-55%; vi: DEAD, Ph3P, p-NO2-PhCO2H, THF, 67%; vii: LiOH, THF-H2O, 93%.<br>
Scheme 3<br>
L-Ala-czs-boroHyp (HI) and L-Ala-ftww-boroHyp (IV) were synthesized from commercially available N-(to,-Butoxycarbonyl)-(5)-(+)-3-pyrrolidinol, as shown in Scheme 3. First, C-lithiation of N-Boc-3-hydroxypyrrolidine was conducted using s-BuLi (2.2 equiv.) in THF-TMEDA (see Gibson, et al.9 cited above) and the reaction was quenched by triisopropyl borate. After workup with NaOH and then HC1, the cis-2,4-disubstituted adduct was afforded as the major diastereomer. The boronic acid was protected wife (+)-pinanediol and then crystallized from ethyl acetate to give the pure boronate compound la in a yield of 51% over two steps. The 4(i?)-boroHyp derivative lb was obtained by inverting the configuration at the C-4 atom from la via the Mitsunobu reaction (see Hodges, et al. Stereoelectronic Effects on Collagen Stability: The Dichotomy of 4-Fluoroproline Diastereomers. J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2003), 125(31): 9262-3) in a 62%<br><br>
yield. Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group in la or lb with 4 N HC1 in dioxane gave cis-boroHyp pinanediol ester 2a or *ra/wr-boroHyp pinanediol ester 2b. Compound 2a or 2b was coupled with N-Boc-L-Ala-OH in the presence of HATU and DIPEA, then the Boc and pinane protecting groups were removed with BCI3 to give the target dipeptide boronate IQ or IV in a 40-45% yield over the last two steps.<br>
Example 5: DPIVInhibition Assays<br>
The compounds prepared in Examples 2-4 were tested in the assay described in Example 1.<br>
L-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro] was found to have an IC50 of 21.92 nM at pH 2 and an IC50 of 12.88 ,iM at pH 8.<br>
L-Ala-5-Me-boroPro was found to have an IC50 of 11.04 nM at pH 2 and an IC50 of 15.41,MatpH8.<br>
L-Ala-czs-boroHyp was found to have an IC50 of 2.95 nM at pH 2 and an IC50 of 5.44,iMatpH8.<br>
L- Ala-*ra/w-boroHyp was found to have an IC50 of 31.13 nM at pH 2 and an IC50 of64.29pMatpH8.<br>
Based upon these data, it was determined that for hydroxylated boroPro-type inhibitors, the hydroxyl group is preferably cis to the boronic acid moiety (or its precursor). Moreover, based upon these results, one of ordinary skill in the art could modify the compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,803,357; U.S. Application Nos. 10/496,706 and 10/496,627, each filed May 25,2004; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/584,581, filed July 1,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, by the addition of a hydroxyl group on the ring of a boronic acid-modified proline, preferably on the 4-position of the ring and/or preferably cis to the boronic acid group (or its precursor).<br>
L-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro] was also tested to determine its inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DP 8 and DP9). The assay is the same as that described in Example 1, except that DPS or DP9 was substituted for DPIV. At the pH values tested, L-Ala-[5-(HOCH2)-2-boroPro] was found to have an IC50 in excess of 70 ,M.<br><br>
Example 6: Selectivity for Dipeptidyl Peptidase Isofomis<br>
The assay described in Example 1 was used to determine the IC50 values for several compounds of the invention. In this example, the assay was conducted for DPIV and DP9. The ratio of IC50 values for each tested compound was calculated in order to determine the selectivity for the DPIV isoform. IC50 values were measured at the same pH iuroughout the assay.<br><br>
Although all compounds except Arg-boroEtGly show a degree of selectivity for DPIV over DP9 (and presumably over the similar DP8), the 5-hydroxymethylated boroPro compound is highly selective for DPIV. Based upon these data, it is expected that addition of hydroxy-, alkyl-, or hydroxyalkyl-containing moieties to a boronic acid-modified proline will result in greater selectivity of an inhibitor for DPIV. Moreover, the such a , group is prefereably cis to the boronic aoid group (or its precursor) of boroPro. Accordingly, preferred compounds of the invention inhibit DPIV at least 10 times, preferably at least 100 times, more strongly than they inhibit DP8 and/or DP9, i.e., have an IC50 at least 10 (or 100) times lower against DPIV than against DPS and/or DP9.<br>
Based upon these results, one of ordinary skill in the art could modify the compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,803,357; U.S. Application Nos. 10/496,706 and 10/496,627, each filed May 25,2004; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/584,581, filed July 1,2004, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, by the addition of hydroxy-, alkoxy-, alkyl-, or hydroxyalkyl-containing moieties to a boronic acid-modified proline, preferably cis to the boronic acid group (or its<br><br>
precursor) of boroPro and/or preferably in the 5-position for alkoxy-, alkyl-, or hydroxyalkyl-containing moieties or in the 4-position for hydroxyl moieties, in order to obtain an inhibitor with greater selectivity for DPIV.<br>
