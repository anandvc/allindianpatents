COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
 [See Section 10]<br>
                     "N-HETEROCYCLIC DERIVATIVES AS NOS INHIBITORS"<br>
BERLEX LABORATORIES, INC., of 15049 San Pablo Avenue, P.O. Box 4099, Richmond, CA 94804-0099, United States of America and PHARMACOPEIA, INC., of 3000 Eastpark Boulevard, Cranbury, NJ 08512, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a series of N-heterocyclic compounds and derivatives useful as<br>
inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and to methods of therapy for various diseases<br>
employing those compounds.		.<br>
Background of the Invention Nitrogen monoxide (MO) has been implicated in a number of diverse physiological processes, including smooth muscle relaxation, platelet inhibition, nerve transmission, immune regulation and penile erection. Nitric oxide is produced under various conditions by virtually all nucleated mammalian cells. A number of pathologies are ascribed to abnormalities in NO production including stroke, insulin dependent diabetes, septic shock-induced hypotension, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Nitric oxide is synthesized in biological tissues by an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which uses NADPH and molecular oxygen to oxidize L-arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide.     .<br>
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) exists in at least three isoforms, which fall into two primary, categories: constitutive and inducible. Two constitutive isoforms, which are calcium and calmodulin dependent, have been identified, and one inducible isoform has been identified. The constitutive isoforms are (1) a neurdnal isoform, NOS-1 or nNOS, which is found in the brain and skeletal muscles and (2) an endothelial isoform, NOS-3 or eNOS, which is expressed in the endothelium of blood vessels, the epithelium of the bronchial tree and in the brain. These constitutive isoforms are not the target of the NOS inhibitors of the present invention.<br>
The inducible isoform (NOS2 or iNOS) is expressed in virtually all nucleated, mammalian cells following exposure to inflammatory cytokines or lipopolysaccharide. Its presence in macrophages'and lung epithelial cells is particularly noteworthy. The inducible isoform is neither stimulated by calcium nor blocked by calmodulin antagonists. It contains several tightly bound co-factors, including FMN, FAD and tetrahydrobiopterin.<br>
Nitric oxide generated by the inducible form of NOS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In experimental animals, hypotension induced by lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor a can be reversed by NOS inhibitors. Conditions which lead to cytokine-induced hypotension include septic shock,- hemodialysis and interleukin therapy in cancer patients. It is expected that an iNOS inhibitor would be effective in treating cytokine-induced hypotension, in addition, recent studies have suggested a role for NO in the pathogenesis of inflammation, and NOS inhibitors would therefore have beneficial effects on inflammatory bowel disease, cerebral ischemia and arthritis. Inhibitors of NOS may also be useful in treating adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocarditis, and they may be useful as adjuvants to short term immunosuppression in transplant therapy.<br><br><br>
WO 01/14371<br><br>
PCT/US00/23173<br><br><br>
The diversity and ubiquity of NO function in physiology make the specific therapeutic targeting of NO-related phenomena an important consideration. Since endogenous NO production is the result of the actions of related but distinct isozymes, the differential inhibition of NOS isozymes allows more selective therapy with fewer side effects.<br>

Testing of the Compounds of the Invention<br>
Nitric oxide synthases are complex enzymes that catalyze the conversion of L-arginine to 35      nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. Catalysis proceeds through two successive oxidations of the guanidinium group of L-arginine.<br>
A cell-based nitric oxide synthase assay employing the measurement of nitric oxide oxidation product, nitrite, in the conditioned medium of cultured cells was employed for the<br><br><br>
WO 01/14371<br><br>
PCT/US00/23173<br><br>
evaluation of the compounds of the invention. The murine monocytic cell lines RAW 264.7 and J774 are well documented as capable of producing &gt;10 μM nitrite in response to immunostimulation:<br>
Induction of iNOS in RAW 264.7 Mouse Monocytes<br>
5	RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were obtained from American Type Culture<br>
Collection (Rockviile, Maryland) and were maintained in RPM11640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5000 units/mL of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2mM glutamine (maintenance medium). NOS activity was measured by a fluorescent assay of the nitric oxide oxidation product, nitrite, (Diamani er a/., Talanta (1986), Vol. 33, pp. 649-652). Induction of iNOS<br>
68<br>
10      (inducible nitric oxide synthase) is stimulated by treatrnent of the cells with lipopolysaccharide and Y-interferon. The method of the assay is described below.<br>
Cells are harvested, diluted to 500,000 cells/mL with.maintenance medium, and seeded into 96-well plates at 100 u.l/well. The plates are incubated overnight at 37"C, under a 5% C02 atmosphere. The medium is then replaced with 90 (il of BME medium containing 10% FBS, 100<br>
15      units/mL of penicillin, 100 μ| streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL of interferon-y and 2 u.g/ml_ of lipopoly-saccharide. N-guanidino-methyl-L-arginine is added to four wells (negative control) at a final concentration of 200μM using 10 nl of 2 mM stock solution in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.3 + 0.1% DMSO and four wells receive only the 100 mM Hepes/0.1% DMSO buffer (positive control). Compounds for evaluation are dissolved at 10-fold the desired final concentration in<br>
20      Hepes/DMSO and 10μL of these solutions is transferred to the 96-well plate. The plates are incubated for 17 hrs at 37"C, under a 5% C02 atmosphere. Nitrite accumulated in the culture medium is determined as follows: add 15 ΜL of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (10 fig/mL in 0.75 M HCI) to each well and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Add 15 μl of 1 N NaOH and measure the fluorescence emission at 405 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm.<br>
25      Enzyme activity in experimental wells is normalized to percent control using the positive and negative control values. The signal to noise ratio is &gt;10 for the assay.<br>

Various in vivo assays may be employed to determine the efficacy of the compounds of<br>
30      the invention in treating a condition resulting from an abnormality in nitric oxide production, such as arthritis. The following is a description of such an assay utilizing rats: Effects of Compounds of the Invention on Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis in Rats<br>
Male Lewis rats were injected intradermally (proximal quarter of the tail) with 0.1 mL of Mycobacterium butyricum in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (10 mg/mL). Either vehicle (acidified .<br>
35      saline, 1 mL/kg) or a compound of the invention (3,10, or 30 mg/kg) were administered<br>
subcutaneously (b.i.d.), starting on the day following adjuvant immunization, and continued until the end of the experiment (N= 10 rats per treatment group). Clinical scores (see below) were measured in all limbs 3 times per week throughout the study. Rats were euthanized 34-35 days<br><br><br>

after immunization. At the time of euthanasia, a radiologic evaluation (see below) of the hind paws was performed, a blood sample was collected for clinical blood chemistry and drug levels (high dose group only; 6 or 12 hours post final dose), a section of liver was obtained for measurement of potential toxicity, and the hind limbs were preserved for histopathological 5      determination.<br>
Clinical scoring - each limb was graded according to the following scale:<br>
0	no signs of inflammation<br>
1	moderate redness, first indication of swelling, joint flexible<br>
2	moderate redness, moderate swelling, joint flexible<br>
10	3	redness, significant swelling and distortion of the paw, joint<br>
beginning to fuse<br>
4	redness, gross swelling and distortion of the paw, joint<br>
completely fused<br>
Radiological scoring - each hind limb was graded on a scale of 0-3 for each of the<br>
15	following parameters:<br>
soft tissue swelling cartilage loss erosion<br>
