DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, TRANSMITTER, AND DATA<br>
SELECTING APPARATUS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a digital communication system, a transmitter, and a data selecting apparatus and, more particularly, to a digital communication system, a transmitter, and a data selecting apparatus in which data is transmitted to many receivers for each receiver or for each receiving croup comprising prescribed receivers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, in many cases, video data, audio data or other data is transmitted and stored in digitized form. In such cases, data is generally divided into pack.ee data comprising plural fields, to be transmitted and stored. Further, in some cases, plural pieces of data is first restructured to be packet data, and then multiplexed to be transmitted through a transmission medium or to be stored in a storage medium. There has been proposed an international standard "MPEG" (Moving Picture Experts Group) for such data structure and multiplexing, and data is transmitted and stored by a method according to a packet data structure of MPEG.<br>
Conventionally, in a system in which the multiplexed packet data is used, a receiving equipment<br><br>
2<br>
selects data to-be-received from the multiplexed packet data. By way of example, a method of transmiting data to each receiver and selecting data in each receiver in digital broadcasting using a data multiplexing method according to MPEG will now be described in brief.<br>
In digital broadcasting, in order to transmit key information for decrypting encrypted video/audio data or the like or a mail, data referred tc as "EMM" (Entitlement Management Message) data must be transmitted to specified receivers on an individual basis. In this case, a data structure of the EMM data termed "section" defined in MPEG system is employed. Section data comprises a field of "table-id" indicating that type of data is EMM data, a field indicative of a number of a destination receiver, and a field in which transmitted data is stored.<br>
A receiver which receives such data comprises a data selecting apparatus for selecting required data, in which a table-id indicative of EMM data and a receiver individual number are stored.<br>
When the receiver receives the section data, the table-id is selected from the received data to check whether this indicates the EMM data. When it indicates the EMM data, the field of the receiver number is selected from the received data to check whether this<br><br>
3<br>
matches the receiver individual number of the receiver. When a match is found between them, the aata selecting apparatus selects and outputs the section data, whereby it is possible re select data for the receiver.<br>
In order to transmit a variety of information with flexibility and only to required receivers, there is a need for a system that groups receivers to transmit data for each group, as well as transmits information to a receiver on an individual basis. There is a further need for the system that transmits the same data to every receiver simultaneously. There is a still further need for the system that selects only receivers being specially 3erved under a contract, and transmits data to these receivers simultaneously.<br>
However, using the EMM data transmission method and data selecting method according to the prior art, in the receiving end, every time the table-id field indicates the EMM data, it is checked whether the number of the receiver number field matches a number of the receiver, and only when there is a match between them, the EMM<br>
data is selected and received; since transmitted data<br>
has a structure in which information indicative of the EMM data is stored in the table-id field, and a destination receiver number is stored in the receiver number field.<br><br>
4<br>
With the data structure having a receiver number uniquely determined for each receiver, data is transmitted only to one receiver specified by a transmit Ling end, and therefore it is impossible to simultaneously transmit data to a receiver group comprising plural receivers or on a broadcasting service basis. To realize this, it is desired that receivers be specified one by one, and then data be sequentially thereto. Hence, one transmitting end requires several hundreds thousand to several millions of receivers, and accordingly, enormous bandwidth is required of flexible data transmission. Data transmission should be rendered flexibly to offer various services to users or in response to users' demands although this is impossible with restricted bandwidth, leading to degradation in quality of service.<br>
In Japanese Patent Application (No. Hei. 7-143117), there is disclosed a communication terminal in which a service group number stored in a receiver which has a right of receiving a program service is compared to a service group number specified in transmitted program data, and when a match is found between them, the program service is received. In this communication terminal, when information for individual ID is received, service type numbers are all checked to detect a match<br><br>
5<br>
in them, and then it is decided whether there is a match in the individual ID, which causes processing amount to be increased for deciding whether to receive the information for individual ID. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

Now, a preferred embodiment OF The present invention will be described.<br>
First, configuration of a digital communication<br>
system according to the present invention is described. Figure 1 illustrates the digital communication system cf the present invention referred to herein by a reference<br><br>
16<br>
numeral 100. The communication system 100 comprises a transmitter 101, and a receiver 102 for receiving digital data from the transmitter 101. The digital communication system 100 is a digital broadcasting system, for example, and comprises one transmitter 101 to many receivers 102, the transmitter 101 being connected to each of the receivers 102 through a communication network NW. Although the communication network NW is wire herein, it may be wireless.<br>
In general, as a data format of data transmitted through the network NW, a "transport stream" defined in MPEG system is employed. The transport stream is a data format in which video or audio, program specification information, EMM data, and so forth are multiplexed in packet. The transport stream is illustrated in figure 8 Referring to figure 8, a transport stream 140 comprises transport stream packets 141 of fixed length. The transport stream packets 141 each comprises a header 141a, an adaptation field 141b, and data 141c, and in the data 141c, video or audio data and so forth are stored. The video or audio data is first stored in a data format illustrated as a PES packet 142, and then stored in the transport stream packet 141. The program specification information and the EMM data die first stored in data formats illustrated as section data 143<br><br>
1 7<br>
and 144, respectively, and then stored in the transport stream packet 141. The PES packet 142 comprises a header 14 2a and data 142b, and may be stored in plural transport stream packets. The section data 143 and 144 also comprises a header 143a and data 143b, and 144a and 144c, respectively, and plural pieces of section data may be stored in a transport stream packet, or one section data may be stored in plural transport stream packets. The section data 144 also contains destination information 14 4b indicating a receiver by which the EMM data is received.<br>
The transmitter 101 comprises a data restructuring unit 103. The data restructuring unit 103 is used for restructuring data to-be-transmitted to be in section -data format according to MPEG. Each receiver 102 comprises a data selecting apparatus 104 for selecting data. The data selecting apparatus 104 comprises a parameter storage unit 105 for prestoring four types of parameters, a correspondence pattern detecting unit 106 for receiving data and comparing the data to the parameter stored in the parameter storage unit 105 to detect a correspondence pattern of them, and an output unit 107 for selecting data on the basis of the correspondence pattern and outputting selected data.<br>
The parameters in the parameter storage unit<br><br>
18<br>
105 can be set by IC card or the Like provided by a transmitting and when the us or subscribes to the digital broadcasting system.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that date is broadcast in any of four manners below. That is, in the digital communication system 100, a signal transmitted from the transmitter 101 is<br>
(1) received only by a specified receiver 102.<br>
(2) received only by a specified receiving group<br>
comprising plural receivers 102.<br>
(3) received by all receivers 102.<br>
(4)	received by a special receiving group.<br>
Next, this will be described in detail with<br>
reference to figures 2 to 5.<br>
Figures 2 to 5 illustrate a data structure o£ EMM data 108 to-be-transmitted. Referring to these figures, the EMM data 108 is data which has been restructured by the data restructuring unit 103, and be in a section data format acuorating to MEEDG. The EMM data 108 comprises a table-id field 109, a first field 110, and a<br>
second field 111.<br>
The table-id field 109 is composed of 8 bits and indicates what type of data section data contains. In this embodiment, in the table-id field 109, "84h" (hereinafter 16 hexadecimal number is represented by "h"<br><br>
19<br>
at its end) is stored. The "84h" indicates that the section data is the EMM data 108 transmitted to a Specified receiver 102.<br>
The first field 110 is composed of 16 bits and contains group destination directing information indicating that the EMM data 10 8 is for a receiving group comprising prescribed receivers of plural receivers, and indicating that to what type of receiving group the EMM. data 108 is transmitted. Further, in-group identifying information indicating that the EMM data 108 is for a specified receiver 102 in an arbitrary group is stored as necessary.<br>
More specifically, in a case where the EMM data 108 is for the specified receiver 102, to low order 1 byte of the receiver individual number as the in-group identifying information, a specified receiver destination number indicating that the EMM data 108 is for a specified receiver "FFh" as the group destination directing information is added, and the resulting number is set in the first field of the EMM data 108 (see figure 2) . For example, where a receiver individual number of 4 bytes is "0 1 2 3 4 S 6 7h", "FF67h" is set in the first field 110 of the EMM data 108. This means that a receiver 102 of a receiver individual number whose low order 1 byte is "67h" in an arbitrary<br><br>
2 0<br>
receiving group is specified as destination. In thus case, "an arbitrary receiving group" is no; a specified one but is any of receiving groups . A receiving group is specified by the group specifying information stored in the second field 111.<br>
When the EMM data 108 is transmitted to a receiving group, a group destination number "0000h" is ser as the group destination directing information (see figure 3). This indicates that the EMM data 108 is for a receiving group comprising prescribed receivers of plural receivers rather than to the individual receiver.<br>
When the EMM data 108 is for every receiver 102, "000lh" is set as the group destination directing information (see figure 4).<br>
When the EMM data 108 is for a special group, "0002h" is set as the group destination directing information (see figure 5),. This indicates the EMM data 108 is transmitted to every receiver 102 which belongs to a special group. It should be noted that the special group consists of receivers 102 under a contract of a special broadcasting service.<br>
The second field 111 is composed of a part of data bytes of the EMM data 108. In this embodiment, first 3 bytes are used. In the second field 111, the group specifying information for specifying a receiving group<br><br>
21<br>
to which the EMM data ICS is transmitted is stored. When the EMM data 108 is for a specified receiving croup, a specified group number "012345h" is set as the group specifying information (see figures 2 and 3) . The "012345h" indicates that the EMM data 108 is transmitted to a receiver in a specified receiving group numbered "012345h" which corresponds to high order 3 bytes of a receiver individual number.<br>
As shown in figure 2, low order 1 byte of the receiver EMM data as the in-group identifying information and the specified group number are set, resulting in the EMM data 108 for a receiver specified by the in-group identifying information in a receiving group specified by the specified group number. As shown in figure 3, the group destination number "00000h" and the specified group number w012345h" are set so that the EMM data 108 is for every receiver 102 which belongs to a receiving group specified by the specified group number.<br>
As shown in figure 4 , the "00021h" is yet so that the EMM data 106 is for every receiver 102 irrespective of receiving groups. As shown in figure 5, a special group number "0002h" is set so that the EMM data 103 is for every receiver 102 in a specie 1 receiving group under a contract of special, service. As shown in<br><br>
22<br>
figures 4 and 5, it is not necessary to set the group specifying information.<br>

Subsequently, the receiver 102 will be described in detail with reference to figure 6. Figure 6 illustrates a construction of the receiver 102. Received broadcast data, for example, data modulated by QPSK, is first demodulated by a digital demodulating circuit 121, and then a packer to-be-received is selected by a packet selecting circuit 122. A packet which contains video or audio data is decrypted by a decrypting circuit 126 when<br><br>

the packet is encrypted and can be received by giving key information for decrypting encryption. Then, from the packet, the video or audio data is selected by a packet processing circuit 123, and then temporarily stored in a buffer memory 129 by a memory access circuit 127. Then the video or audio data is sent to a video/ audio decoding circuit 128 at time for regeneration and display, to be expanded therein, and the resulting restored video or audio data is output as NTSC or, PAL video signals, to be displayed. From a packet which contains section data such as program specification information other than EMM data, the section data is selected by the packet processing circuit 123, and sent to a section processing circuit 124. In the section processing circuit 124, section data to-be-received other than the EMM data is selected by a section selecting circuit 125, and then sent to the memory access circuit 127, to be stored in the buffer memory 12 9. The section data stored in the buffer memory 129 is used by a CPU 120 for constructing a program table or a selecting a program for the receiver.<br>
Meanwhile, a packet which contains the EMM data 10S<br>
is selected by the packet processing circuit 12 3, and sent to the section processing circuit 124 . In the<br>
section processing circuit 124, the section selecting<br><br>
24<br>
circuit 125 and a data selecting apparatus 104 perform selection on the basis of the information stored in respective fields 109, HO, and 111 of the EMM data 108, and then send EMM data to-be-received through the memory access circuit 127 to the buffer memory 129, to be stored therein. In a case where the EMM data stored in the buffer memory 129 indicates information for decrypting video or audio data which can be received, the CPU 12 0 reads the information and forms key information, and sets the same in the decrypting circuit 12 6, thereby allowing decrypting video or audio data. In a case where the EMM data indicates mail information, it is read by the CPU 120 in accordance with operation of the user, and then sent to the video/audio decoding circuit 128, to be displayed.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates operation of the data selecting apparatus 104 in figure 6. Referring to figures 1 and 7, the parameter storage unit 10 5 of the data selecting apparatus 104 (see figure 1) can store first to fourth parameters. In this embodiment, "OOOOh", "FF67h" and "012345h" are stored as the first parameter 130, the second parameter 131, and the third parameter 132, respectively. In addition, "0001h" and "0002h" are stored as the fourth parameters 133 and 134, respectively.<br><br>
25<br>
The correspondence pattern detecting unit 106 of the data selecting apparatus 104 (see figure 1) comprises a first detecting circuit 13F,, a second detecting circuit 136, a third detecting circuit 137, and fourth detecting circuits 138 and 139.<br>
The first detecting circuit 135 compares the first parameter 130 "0000h" to the information stored in the first field 110 of the EMM data 108, to detect a match/mismatch between them, and when the match is found, the circuit 135 outputs the input. EMM data 108 .<br>
The second detecting circuit 136 compares the second parameter 131 "FF67h" to the information stored in the first field 110 of the EMM data 108, to detect a<br>
match/mismatch between them and when the match is found<br>
the circuit 136 outputs the input EMM data 108.<br>
The third detecting circuit 137 compares the third parameter 132 "0l2345h" to the. 1 information stored in the second field 111 of the EMM data 108 output from the first detecting circuit 135 or the second detecting circuit 136, to detect a match/mismatch between them, and when the match is found, the circuit 137 outputs the input EMM data 108.<br>
The fourth detecting circuit 138 compares the fourth parameter 133 "OOOlh" to the information stored in the first field 110 of the received EMM data 108, to detect<br><br>
26<br>
a match/mismatch between their., and when the march is found, the circuit 138 outputs the input EMM data 108.<br>
The fourth defecting circuit 139 compares the fourth parameter 134 w0002h" to the information stored in the first field 110 of the received EMM data 106, to detect a match/mismatch between them, and when the match is found, the circuit 139 outputs the input EMM data 108.<br>
In other words, the first to fourth detecting circuits 135 to 139 respectively filter the EMM data 108. When the EMM data is output from at 1 east one of the third and fourth detecting circuits 137, and 133 and 139, the output unit 107 outputs the EMM data 108. As a result, a receiver 102 can receive only EMM data 108 specified for the receiver.<br>
Although the fourth detecting circuits 138 and 139 are shown as separate ones in figure 7 to explain operation of the data selecting apparatus 104, they may be the same circuit.<br>
More specifically, the EMM data 108 is input to the<br>
first , second and forth detecting circuits 100,100<br><br>
138, and 139.<br>
The first, detecting circuit 135 checks whether there is a match between the information stored in the first field 110 and the first parameter 130 "0000h", and when there is the match between them (a correspondence<br><br>
27<br>
pattern has been detected), the EMM data 108 passes through the first detecting circuit 135.<br>
The second detecting circuit 136 checks whether there is a match between the information stored in the first field 110 and the second parameter 131 "F67h", and when there is the match between them, the EMM data 108 passes through the second detecting circuit 136.<br>
The EMM data 108 which has passed the first detecting circuit 135 or the second detecting circuit 136 is input to the third detecting circuit 137, which checks whether there is a match between the information stored in the second field 111 and the third parameter 132 "012345h", and when there is the match -between them, the EMM data 10ft passes through the third detecting circuit 137, to the output: unit 107, which outputs the EMM data 108.<br>
The fourth detecting circuit 138 checks whether there is a match between the information stored in the first field 110 and the fourth parameter 133 "OOOlh", and when there is the match between them, the EMM data 108 passes through the fourth detecting circuit 133.<br>
The fourth detecting circuit 139 checks whether there is a match between the information stored in the first field 110 and the fourth parameter 134 "0002h", and when there is the match between them, the EMM data<br><br>
28<br>
10b passes through the fourth detecting circuit 139. The output unit 107 outputs the EMM data 10S which has passed through the fourth detecting circuit 138 or 139.<br>
Substantially, broadcasting in the communication system 100 will be described.<br>
Referring to figure 1 again, the data restructuring unit 10 3 of the transmitter 101 restructures the EMM data 108 to be in one of the formats shown in figures 2 to 5 and transmits the same to the receiver 102, where the EMM data 108 is selected as described below. (1) BROADCASTING FOR SPECIFIED RECEIVER<br>
Assume that "01234567h" is set as the number of a specified receiver 102. Nigh order 3 bytes "012345h" of 4 bytes "01234567b" indicate a receiving group to which the specified receiver 102 belongs, and low order 1 byte "67h" indicates the number of the receiver 102 in the receiving group. Therefore, the receiver individual number "FF67h" and the specified group number "012345h" are set in the first field 110. and the second field 111 of the EMM data 108 (see figure 2), respectively. Also assume that, the second parameter 131 "FF67h", and the third parameter 132 "012345h" are respectively set in the parameter storage unit 105 of the data selecting apparatus 104 of one of the plural receivers 102 .<br>
Referring to figure 6 again, through the digital<br><br>
29<br>
demodulating circuit 121, the packet selecting circuit 122, and the pocket processing circuit 123, the EMM data 108 is input to the section processing circuit 124, where the table-in field 10S of the EMM data 108 is checked by the section selecting circuit 125, and it is decided that this is EMM data when "84h", and the EMM data 108 is output to the data selecting apparatus 104. In this embodiment, since "8 4h" is stored in the data identifier field 109, the EMM data 108 is input to the data selecting apparatus 104.<br>
Upon receiving the EMM data 108, the data selecting apparatus 104 compares the information stored in the first field 110 to the first parameter 130, the second parameter 131, and the fourth parameters 133 and<br>
134 as already described with reference to figure 7. Since the receiver individual number wFF67h" and the<br>
specified group number "012345h" are set in the first field 110 and the second field 111 of the EMM data 108, respectively, the "FF67h" matches the second parameter 131 of the receiver 102, so that the EMM data 108 passes through the second detecting circuit 136. Then, the specified group number of the second field 111 "012345h" matches the third parameter 132 of the receiver 102, so that the EMM data 108 passes through the third detecting circuit,137 to the output unit 107, which outputs the<br><br>
3 0<br>
EMM data ICQ.<br>
As thus described, broadcasting for the specified receiver 102 can he provided. On the other hand, in a case where another number is set in a storage position of the receiver individual number or the specified group number, since it is different from the second parameter 131 or the third parameter 132, the EMM data 10S will not be output from the output unit: 107. (2) BROADCASTING FOR SPECIFIED RECEIVING GROUP<br>
Assume that "012345h" is set in receivers 1C2 which belong to a specified group. Therefore, the group destination number "OOOOh" and the specified group number "012346h" are set in the first field 110 and The second field 111 of the EMM data 108 {see figure 3), respectively. Also assume that the first parameter 130 "0000h"f and the third parameter 132 "012345h" are respectively set in the parameter storage unit 105 of the data selecting apparatus 104 of every receiver 102 in the specified group.<br>
Upon receiving the EMM data 108, the data selecting apparatus 10 4 compares the information stored in the first field 110 to the first parameter 130, the second parameter 131, and the fourth parameters 133 and 134 as already described with reference to figure 7, Since the group destination number "0000h" and the specified group<br><br>
31<br>
number "012345b" are set in the first field HO and the second field III of the EMM data 108, respectively, the "0000h" matches the first parameter 130 of the receiver 102, so that the EMM data 108 passes through the first detecting circuit 135. Then, the "C12345h" marches the third parameter 132 of the receiver 102, so that the EMM data 108 passes through the third detecting circuit 1-37 to the output unit 107, which outputs the EMM data 108. This operation is performed by every receiver 102 in the specified group.<br>
As thus described, broadcasting for every receiver 102 in the specified group can be provided. On the other hand, in a case where another number is set in a storage position of the group destination number or the specified group number, since it is different from the first parameter 130 or the third parameter 132, the EMM data 108 will not be output from the output unit 107. (3) BROADCASTING FOR ALL RECEIVERS<br>
Assume that the number for specifying all receivers "OOOlh" is set in the first field 110 of the EMM data 108 {see figure 4). Also assume that the fourth parameter 133 "OOOlh" is set in the parameter storage<br><br>
32<br>
apparatus 104 compares the information stored in the first field 110 to the first parameter 130, the second parameter 131, and the fourth parameters 133 and 134 as already described with reference to figure 7. since the "0001h" is set in the first field 110, the "OOOlh" matches the fourth parameter 133 of the receiver 1C2, so that the EMM data 108 passes through the fourth detecting circuit 138 to the output unit 107, which outputs the EMM data 108. Thus, broadcasting for all receivers can be provided., On the other hand, in a case where another number is set in a storage position of the number for specifying all receivers, since it is different from the fourth parameter 133, the EMM data 108 will not be output from the output unit 107 . (4) BROADCASTING FOR SPECIAL RECEIVING GROUP<br>
Assume that a special group number "00Q2h" is set in the first field 110 of the EMM data 108 (see figure 5). Also assume that the fourth parameter 134 V0002h" is set in the parameter storage unit 10 5 of the data selecting apparatus 104 of every receiver 102 in the special group. Upon receiving the EMM data 108, the data selecting apparatus 104 compares the information stored in the first field 110 to the first parameter 130, the second parameter 131, and the fourth parameters 133 and 134 as already described with reference to tigure 7. Since the<br><br>
33<br>
special group number "0C02h" is set in the first field<br>
110, the "OOO2h." matches the fourth parameter 134 of the receiver 102, so that the EMM data 108 passes through<br>
the fourth detecting circuit 139 to the output unit, 10, which outputs the EMM data 108.<br>
As thus described, broadcasting for the special group, namely, a receiving group comprising receivers under a contract of special service can be provided. On the other hand, in a case where another number is set in a storage position of the special group number, since it is different, from the fourth parameter 134, the EMM data 108 will net be output from the output unit 107.<br>
Although the aforementioned four cases have been described as being separate ones, both the broadcasting for all receivers and the broadcasting for the special group become possible provided that both "OOOlh" and "0Q02h" are set in the receiver 102 as the fourth parameters. Furthermore, the numbers or the fourth parameters and the fourth detecting circuits may be increased to set and detect plural kinds of special groups, thereby broadcasting for plural special groups can be provided.<br>
Besides, the first field 110 or the receiver indivi dual number is illustrative and not restrictive. In addition, although the EMM data 108 is transmitted in<br><br>
a section data format in the above description, a data selecting apparatus which selects data having another format nay be employed. Yet in addition, although the data transmission in digital broadcasting according to MPEG has beer, described, the data transmission is not restricted thereto, and is applicable to a case where data comprising plural fields is selected.<br>
As should be appreciated from the foregoing description, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, in digital broadcasting in which various types or data is multiplexed and transmitted, the following data transmission is realized. (1) Data is transmitted to a specified receiver. (2) Data is transmitted to a specified group{receivers are grouped by their individual numbers). (3) Data is transmitted to all receivers simultaneously. (4) Data is transmitted to every receiver in a special group (receivers are grouped on a service basis). As a consequence, destination is specified flexibly, whereby maximum efficiency in use of transmission bandwidth is achieved while significantly reducing the frequency at which the same data is transmitted, as compared with a case where data is transmitted to one receiver.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with the preferred embodiment on the present invention, since a receiver<br><br>
35<br>
individual, number for identifying a destination receiver of EMM data is determined by group specifying information indicating a receiving group to which the destination receiver belongs, and in-group identifying information for identifying the receiver in the receiving group, and the in-group identifying information is included in the group destination directing information of the EMM data, it is possible to make a decision on the group destination directing information, and simultaneously on whether there is a match in the in-group identifying number. Therefore, when the EMM data is selected by the data selecting circuit, a match in the group specifying information is detected by a" single detecting circuit (third detecting circuit) irrespective of group destination or individual receiver destination, resulting in reduced processing amount, for deriding whether to receive the EMM data. As a consequence, it is possible to select EMM data with a small scale circuit.<br><br>
