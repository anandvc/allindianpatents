				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of cyclopentane from light petroleum fraction.<br>
This invention also relates to the separation of cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons (naphthenes) from close boiling paraffinic hydrocarbons (paraffins).This invention particularly relates to the separation of cyclopentane from close boiling paraffins by extractive distillation using a selective solvent.<br>
Cyclopentane (CP) has emerged as the best alternative to CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs for blowing polyurethane used as insulation in refrigeration systems and has been successfully used by all major European refrigerator manufacturers. Its use is now spreading rapidly in both developed and developing countries worldwide. The reasons for the choice of CP for these application are: zero ozone depleting potential, environmental acceptance, reasonably low initial thermal conductivity, appropriate boiling point. These factors outweighed the disadvantage of CP flammability. According to Montreal Protocol, CFCs etc. have to be phased out worldwide by 2010 due to their role in depleting ozone layer and global warming. Accordingly in India an ozone unit has been set up in the Ministry of Environment and Forests to plan the ozone depleting substances (ODS) phase out programme. India had demanded $250 million from multilateral fund under UN environmental programme to cover the loss of dismantling and destruction of existing machinery which produce ODS and the loss of profit. However, India has been finally given $82 million for the purpose.<br>
The estimated world demand of CP is reported to be around 85000 t/a. r<br>
V _        7<br>
Indian companies manufacture over 5 million domestic refrigerator units per year/ besides central air conditioners, ice candy machines, deep refrigerators, mobile air conditioners, water coolers, unitary air conditioners etc. The estimated demand of CP in Indian market will be around 4000 t/a besides substantial<br><br>
potential for export. The import price of CP varies from Rs. 50,000 to Rs 90,000 per ton depending on the purity of CP.<br>
At present CP in the industry is produced either by catalytic hydrogenation of cyclopentadiene (an intermediate by-product of thermal cracking units) or by synthetic methods. This can also be produced by hydrogenation of cyclopentanone or dehydrogenation of cyclohexane.<br>
Extractive distillation is another known technique for separating mixture of components having a relative volatility close to unity (i.e., having nearly equal volatility and having nearly the same boiling point). It is difficult to separate the components of such mixtures by conventional fractional distillation. In an extractive distillation process, an agent (called 'solvent') is added to feed mixture of components to be separated so that the relative volatilities of the components of the mixture are changed to cause effective separation by extractive distillation. The added solvent is usually chosen so as to exhibit high "selectivity" between components to be separated. Selectivity is a relative term related to the change in volatilities of components in the mixture caused by the presence of the solvent. The larger the difference in relative volatility of the components in the mixture, easier the separation of components in a distillation step. Therefore, a solvent should be such that it causes appreciable differences between the relative volatilities of the components in a mixture, and thus allows the separation of components in a mixture with fewer distillation stages. Capacity of the solvent is another important property that affects the solvent rate and total throughput which, in turn, affects efficiency of the column. There should be good compromise between selectivity and capacity of the solvent.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation of diolefins for the production of CP have been employed (Hearn Dennis et.al. US Pat. US6169218, 2001). Extractive distillation method has been tried by different researchers (R.E. Brown and P.M. , US Pat. US4954224, 1990; R.E. Brown et.al., US Pat. US5055162, 1991<br><br>
and P.M. Lee et.al., US Pat. US5032232, 1991) for separation of cyclopentane from close boiling paraffins using different selective solvents. In these cases synthetic feed mixtures consisting of 2,2-dimethyl butane as typical close boiling paraffin (b.p. 50°C) and CP (b.p.49°C) have been used. US Pat. 4954224 (1990) by R.E. Brown and P.M. Lee reports the use of either N- (p-mercaptoethyl)-2-pyrrolidone (NMEP) or cyclohexanol (CHOL) or N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) or their mixture as solvents for separation of cycloalkane (cyclopentane) and close boiling alkane (2,2-dimethylbutane). R.E. Brown et.al. (US Pat. 5055162, 1991) have further reported use of N-(p-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidone (HEP) or cyclohexanol (CHOL) or NMP or their mixture as solvent for separation of cycloalkane (cyclopentane) from close boiling paraffins (2,2-dimethyl butane). F.M. Lee et.al. (US Pat. 5032232; 1991) has reported N-methyl-2-thiopyrrolidone (NMTP) as solvent for separation of cyclopentane from 2-dimethyl butane.<br>
All the above existing methods either involve hydrogenation step or synthesis or extractive distillation. Hydrogenation and synthesis methods are generally cost intensive approaches involving use of hydrogen, a catalyst and high pressure units. Where as extractive distillation methods developed above are based on synthetic feed mixture consisting of cyclopentane and 2,2-dimethylbutane only. In typical light petroleum streams higher boiling components like 2-methyl pentane (b.p. 60°C), 3-methyl pentane (b.p. 63°C) and 2,3-dimethyl butane (b.p. 58°C) etc., which are more difficult to separate from CP, are also invariably present. Presence of these components affect the final purity and recovery of CP in an extractive distillation step.<br>
In the present invention, therefore, actual feedstocks available in the petroleum industry have been investigated wherein different heart cuts have been prepared, analysed (componentwise) and studied in extractive distillation step for production of CP of required purity. The studies revealed that it is difficult to produce required purity of CP in extractive distillation step when these components (2-methyl pentane, 3-methyl pentane, 2,2-dimethyl butane and 2,3-<br><br>
dimethyl butane) are present besides pentanes in appreciable concentrations in the feedstock intended for CP production.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for production of cyclopentane from light petroleum fraction.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to identify and optimise the typical refinery feedstock so as to minimise the concentration of higher boiling components (2-methyl pentane, 3-methyl pentane, 2,2-dimethyl butane and 2,3-dimethyl butane) and maximise the concentration and recovery of CP in the optimised boiling range of the feed.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to study this optimised feedstock composition to separate CP from close boiling paraffinic hydrocarbons in the extractive distillation step using selective solvent.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to simulate the results using the mutual solubility data of individual hydrocarbon components with selective solvent.<br>
In the present invention, therefore, the cyciopentane is separated from close boiling paraffinic hydrocarbons from optimised light petroleum feedstock by extractive distillation using polar organic solvent like NMP.<br>
The flow diagram of the present invention is shown in Figure-1 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
According to this process diagram the feed stream is introduced through line (1) in the fractional distillation column (A) where two streams are produced. The bottom stream being rich in heavier impurities is discarded via line (2). The top stream containing light boiling components alongwith maximum CP<br><br>
introduced through line (3) in the extractive distillation column (B) and lean solvent is introduced via line (4) where two streams meet counter currently. The column may be comprised either by packed or plate column. The distillate and bottom phase, thus produced are separately withdrawn through line (5) &amp; (6) respectively.<br>
The bottom phase obtained from column (B) is introduced via line (6 in the second distillation column (C) for solvent recovery from where solvent free hydrocarbons are withdrawn through line (7) and recovered solvent is withdrawn through line (8) routed through reboiler (D) and water heater (E) recycled back to extractor (B) via line (4).<br>
The distilled water from separator (F) is fed to water heater (E) via line (9). The steam generated in water heater is fed in to the solvent recovery column © through line (10). The reflux ratio (Ratio of the portion of condensed vapour which is returned to the distillation column to the portion of condensed vapour which is withdrawn as distillate) may be employed in the range of 5:1 to about 50:1 (vol/vol).<br>
