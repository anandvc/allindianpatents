COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
"CRYSTALLINE FORMS OF Et02C-CH 2-[R]Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH"]<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish  company,   of  S-151   85   Sodertalje,<br>
SWEDEN,	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
6-12-2005<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to new solid state forms of a drug, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to processes for obtaining them.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations (e.g. oral dosage forms such as tablets) comprising the active compound.<br>
Further, in the manufacture of oral drug compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following aa"ministration to a patient. This is of particular importance in the manufacture of compositions comprising antithrombotic agents.<br>
Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors. The drug substance, and compositions containing it, should be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the active component"s physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility).<br><br><br>
Moreover, it is also important to be able to provide drug in a form which is as chemically-pure as possible.<br>
Amorphous materials may present significant problems in this regard.  For<br>
example, such materials are typically difficult to handle and to formulate,<br>
provide for unreliable solubility, and are often found to be unstable and<br>
chemically impure.<br>
The skilled person will appreciate mat, if a drug can be readily obtained in a stable crystalline form, the above problems may be solved.<br>
Thus, in the manufacture of commercially viable, and pharmaceutically acceptable, drug compositions, it is important, wherever possible, to provide drug in a substantially crystalline, and stable, form.<br>
It is to be noted, however, that this goal is not always achievable. Indeed, typically, it is not possible to predict, from molecular structure alone, what the crystallisation behaviour of a compound, either as such or in the form of a salt, will be. This can only be determined empirically.<br>
Prior Art<br>
International patent application WO 97/23499 discloses a number of compounds, which have been found to be useful as prodrugs of thrombin inhibitors, which thrombin inhibitors are of the general formula:<br>
Ra02C-CH2(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-H<br>
wherein R2 represents H, benzyl or C1-6 alkyl, Cgl represents cyclohexylglycine, Aze represents S-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid and Pab-H   represents   4-arninomethyl-amidinobenzene.      The   active   thrombin<br><br>
inhibitors are themselves disclosed  in the earlier  international  patent application WO 94/29336.<br>
WO 97/23499 also contains a specific disclosure of the compound:<br>
Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH wherein   Pab-OH   represents   4-aminomethyl-benzeneamidoxime.       A process for the synthesis of this compound is described in Example 17 of WO 97/23499, where it is purified by preparative RPLC and isolated in an amorphous form.<br>
Whether it is possible to provide Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH in a crystalline form is not disclosed in WO 97/23499. Furthermore, no information is provided in relation to how mis compound may be obtained in such a form.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH may be obtained in one or more forms that are substantially crystalline in nature.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention mere is provided Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, in a substantially crystalline form (hereinafter referred to as "the compounds of the invention").<br>
Although we have found that it is possible to produce Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, and salts thereof, in forms which are greater than 80% crystalline, by "substantially crystalline" we include greater than 10% (e.g. greater that 20%), preferably greater then 30%, and more preferably<br><br><br>
*-i	f<br><br>
greater than 40% crystalline.    The degree (%) of crystallinity may be<br>
determined by the skilled person using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD).<br>
Other techniques, such as solid state NMR, FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy,<br>
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and microcalorimetry, may also<br>
      be used.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salts which may be mentioned include inorganic, and organic, acidic and basic addition salts, such as hydrogen halide salts (e.g.  HBr salts),  carboxylic  acid  salts,  lower<br>
       alkanesulphonate salts (e.g.  linear or branched C1-6 alkanesulphonate, preferably     C1-3    alkanesulphonate,     and     especially     ethane-     and methanesulphonate    salts)    and    ammonium    and    amine    salts. Toluenesulphonate salts may also be mentioned. For a full list of salts mat may be mentioned see Berge et al, J.  Pharm.  Sci., 66,  1  (1977).<br>
      However, we prefer that the compounds of the invention are not in the form of a salt.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in the form of a solvate (by which we include a hydrate) or otherwise.<br><br>
We have found, surprisingly, mat the compounds of the invention have an improved stability when compared with Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH prepared as described in WO 97/23499.<br>
      According to a further aspect of die invention, there is uius provided a stable form of Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br><br><br>
The term "stability" as defined hereto includes chemical stability and solid state stability.<br>
By "chemical stability", we include that the compound, or salt, can be stored in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as tablet, capsule etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of chemical degradation or decomposition.<br>
By "solid state stability", we include that the compound, or salt, can be stored in an isolated solid form, or in the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with pharmaceurically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as tablet, capsule etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of solid state transformation (e.g. crystallisation, recrystallisation, solid state phase transition, hydration, dehydration, solvatisation or desolvatisation).<br>
Examples of "normal storage conditions" include temperatures of between minus 80 and plus 50°C (preferably between 0 and 40°C and more preferably room-temperatures, such as 15 to 30°C), pressures of between 0.1 and 2 bars (preferably at atmospheric pressure), relative humidities of between 5 and 95% (preferably 10 to 75%), and/or exposure to 460 lux of UV/visible light, for prolonged periods (i.e. greater than or equal to six monms). Under such conditions, compounds of the invention may be found to be less man 15%, more preferably less than 10%, and especially less than 5%, chemically degraded/decomposed, or solid state transformed, as appropriate.   The skilled person will appreciate that the<br><br><br>
above-mentioned upper and lower limits for temperature, pressure and relative humidity represent extremes of normal storage conditions, and that certain combinations of these extremes will not be experienced during normal storage (e.g. a temperature of 50°C and a pressure of 0.1 bar).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be obtained advantageously by<br>
crystallising EtO2C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or a salt of Et02C-CH2-<br>
(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH.	<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the production of a compound of the mvennon which comprises<br>
crystallising Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OHt or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof.<br>
It is possible to crystallise Et02C-CH2(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH and pharnaceutically-acceptable salts thereof with or without the presence of a solvent system (e.g. crystallisation may be from a melt, under supercritical conditions, or achieved by sublimation). However, we prefer that the crystallisation is from an appropriate solvent system.<br>
We have found that it is possible advantageously to crystallise Et02C-CHr (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof via crystallisation following dissolution of the compound or salt in question, or, more advantageously, from solutions which have been extracted from reaction solutions in which the compound or salt in question has been formed, or, particularly advantageously, from reaction solutions within which the compound or salt in question has been formed.<br><br><br>
The solvent system may be heterogeneous or homogeneous and may thus comprise one or more organic solvents, such as alkyl acetates (e.g. linear or branched C1-6 alkyl acetates, such as ethyl acetate, iso-propyl acetate and butyl acetate), lower (e.g. linear or branched C1-6) alkyl alcohols (e.g. ethanol, iso-propanol), aliphatic (e.g. C6-12, such as C7-12, aliphatic) hydrocarbons (e.g. iso-octane and n-heptane) and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene), dialkyl ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl iso-butyl ketone), acetomtrile and dialkyl ethers (e.g. di-iso-propyl ether), and/or aqueous solvents, such as water. Mixtures of any of the above-mentioned solvents may be used.<br>
Different crystalline forms may have different solubilities in different organic solvents at any given temperature. In this respect, above-mentioned solvents may be employed as "antisolvents" (i.e. a solvent in which compounds of the invention are poorly soluble), and may thus aid die crystallisation process.<br>
When the crystallisation takes place from a reaction solvent in which Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or salt thereof, has been formed, or from a solvent following an extraction, suitable solvents thus include alkyl acetates (such as ethyl acetate), toluene, methyl iso-butyl ketone, lower alkyl alcohols (such as erhanol) etc..<br>
Crystallisation of compounds of the invention from an appropriate solvent system may be achieved by attaining supersaruration in a solvent system which comprises Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or salt thereof, (e.g. by cooling, by solvent evaporation and/or via the addition of anti-solvent (i.e. a solvent in which the compounds of the invention are poorly soluble (e.g. iso-octane,  n-heptane, di-iso-propyl  ether,   toluene,  acetone))),  or by<br><br>
decreasing the solubility of die substance by die addition of a salt (such as NaCl or triediylamineHCI).<br>
Crystallisation temperatures and crystallisation times depend upon the concentration of me compound in solution, and upon the solvent system which is used.<br>
Crystallisation may also be initiated and/or effected with or without seeding with crystals of the appropriate crystalline compound of the invention, and/or by adjustment of pH.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared in the form of a solvate (by which we include in me form of a hydrate, such as a monohydrate) or otherwise (e.g. in me form of an anhydrate). (The term "anhydrate", when used in this context, also includes "ansolvates".)<br>
To ensure that anhydrate is produced, the solvent from which me crystallisation occurs should preferably be dried, either before or during the crystallisation process, in order to reduce me water content below a critical level, which should preferably not be exceeded during die crystallisation. Solvent may be dried during the crystallisation process, for example by decreasing the water content of a mixture of the compound to be crystallised and an appropriate organic solvent/aqueous solvent system (e.g. by increasing the amount of organic solvent mat is present and/or removal of water by formation of an azeotrope, widi successive distillations). Nonetheless, we have found mat, for certain compounds of the invention that are anhydrates, such solvent drying is not necessary to ensure formation.<br><br><br>
To ensure that monohydrate is produced, water must be present in the solvent from which the crystallisation occurs. The water content should preferably be kept above the critical level mentioned above during the crystallisation.<br>
The "critical level" of water depends upon factors such as temperature, concentration in solution of the compound to be crystallised, impurity profile, and the solvent system which is employed, but may be determined non-invenrively.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the invention which is in the form of an anhydrate, and a compound of the invention which is in the form of a monohydrate.<br>
Crystalline anhydrate may be prepared by crystallising Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH from one or more organic solvents (such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, iso-propanol, iso-octane, di-iso-propyl ether), water or mixtures thereof, which may have been dried, and/or may be dried during the crystallisation process, such mat the water content is below the above-mentioned critical level.  Thus, anhydrate may<br>
   be produced by crystallisation from a solvent system which is substantially<br>
   free ot water.<br>
By "substantially free of water", we include that the water content in the solvent system is below that which will result in the formation of, at most, 10% monohydrate, for any particular solvent system and set of crystallisation conditions.<br><br><br>
Conversely, crystalline monohydrate may be prepared by crystallising Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH from a solvent system comprising water, or a combination of water and one or more organic solvents, including organic solvents mat are capable of dissolving water (e.g. ethyl acetate, ethanol, iso propanol).<br>
Crystalline monohydrate may also be obtained by dissolving the substance in an aqueous solution (e.g. water or mixtures of water and an alcohol, such as ethanol or iso-propanol) with a low pH followed by the addition of a weak base until the pH exceeds (and is preferably just above) a value of about 5 to 6 (at room temperature).<br>
Crystalline monohydrate may also be prepared via other crystalline forms (such as an anhydrous form). This is achieved if the critical water content referred to above is exceeded during the crystallisation. Similarly, a crystalline anhydrate may be prepared from crystalline monohydrate by lowering the water content to below the above-mentioned critical water content during the crystallisation process.<br>
Whether anhydrate or monohydrate crystallises is related to the kinetics<br>
and equilibrium conditions of the respective forms at the specific<br>
conditions. Thus, as may be appreciated by the skilled person, the<br>
crystalline form that is obtained depends upon both the kinetics and the<br>
thermodynamics    of    the    crystallisation    process.	Under    certain<br>
thermodynamic conditions (solvent system, temperature, pressure and concentration of compound of the invention), one crystalline form may be more stable than another (or indeed any odier). However, crystalline forms that have a relatively low thermodynamic stability may be kinetically favoured.    Thus, in addition, kinetic factors, such as time.<br><br><br>
impurity profile, agitation, the presence or absence of seeds, etc. may also influence which forms appear. Thus, the procedures discussed herein may be adapted by the skilled person as appropriate in order to obtain different crystalline forms.<br>
Crystalline monohydrate may also be formed by elutriation of other crystallme forms (e.g. an anhydrous form) in water or a mixture of water and one or several organic solvents (such as ethanol or iso-propanol). The slurry which is formed should preferably be seeded with crystals of the crystalline monohydrate in order to ensure that an appropriate transformation takes place. As before, there is a critical water content, which depends on the solvent system which is employed and the temperature.<br>
Thus, we have found that compounds of the invention in one crystalline form may be interconverted via recrystallisation to other crystalline forms.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the conversion of one crystalline form of a compound of the invention  to another which comprises recrystallising a compound, of the invention<br><br><br>
 Compounds of be contain no more than 3 %, preferably 2%, more.  preferably 1% and more preferably 0.5% (w/w) water, whether such-wate .rs -bound "(crystal water or omerwise) or not. Hydrates contain no less than 0.5 mol of water per mol of Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH.<br><br><br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are those that are in the form of an anhydrate. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the invention that contains no more than 3% (w/w), preferably no more man 2% (w/w), water, whether such water is bound (crystal water or otherwise) or not.<br>
When the compound of the invention is to be produced in the form of an acidic or basic addition salt, an appropriate amount of the appropriate acid or base may be added to the crystallisation mixture before crystallisation is effected. Alternatively, after addition of the salt, all of the solvents) may be evaporated and the resultant crystalline and/or amorphous form of the salt may be re-dissolved in an appropriate solvent system, such as ethyl formate or an alkyl alcohol such as n-heptanol or n-octanol, followed by agitation of the resultant solution with a view to inducing crystallisation.<br>
Preferred addition salts include acidic addition salts, such as hydrobromide and methanesulphonate salts.<br>
The preparation, and characterisation, of inter alia anhydrate, and monohydrate, forms of compounds of the invention are described hereinafter. Different crystalline forms of the compounds of the invention (e.g. anhydrate and monohydrate) may be readily characterised using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods, for example as described hereinafter.<br>
In order to ensure that crystalline forms as described herein are prepared in the absence of other crystalline forms described herein, crystallisations are preferably carried out by seeding with nuclei and/or seed crystals of die desired crystalline form in the complete absence of nuclei and/or seed<br><br><br>
crystals of other crystalline forms described herein. This applies particularly to each of the specific crystalline forms, the preparation of which is described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be isolated using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example decanting, filtering or centrifuging.<br>
Compounds may be dried using standard techniques. It will be appreciated by the skilled person that drying temperature and drying time may affect the solid state properties of compounds (or salts) that are in tie form of solvates, such as hydrates (e.g. dehydration may occur at elevated temperatures and/or reduced pressure). For example, following the formation of crystalline monohydrate, there is a critical humidity below which the drying should not be performed, as the crystal water may be lost and a solid state transformation may occur, i.e. the crystal water will be lost if the crystals are dried at high temperatures or at very low pressures for a longer period.<br>
We have.found that, by employing the crystallisation process as described herein, it is possible to produce compounds of the invention with a chemical purity which is above that of the Et02C-CH2-(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab-OH, or salt, which is to be isolated in the first instance.<br>
Further purification of compounds of the invention may be effected using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example impurities may be removed by way of recrystallisation from an appropriate solvent system (e.g. ethyl acetate, iso-propanol, iso-octane, ethanol, water or a combination of these solvents).   Suitable temperatures<br><br><br>
and times for the recrystallisation depend upon the concentration of the compound, or salt, in solution, and upon the solvent system which is used.<br>
When compounds of the invention are crystallised, or recrystallised, as described herein, the resultant compound, or salt, is in a form which has the improved chemical and solid state stability mentioned hereinbefore.<br>
Pharmaceutical Preparations and Medical Uses<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, buccally, rectally, dermally, nasally, tracheally, bronchially, by any other parenteral route, or via inhalation, in die form of a pharmaceutical preparation comprising the compound of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. However we prefer that the compound of the invention is a form which is suitable for oral administration.<br>
Depending on the disorder, and the patient to be treated, as well as the route of administration, the compounds may be administered at varying doses (see below).<br>
The compounds of the invention may be further processed before formulation into a suitable pharmaceutical formulation. For example, the crystalline form may be milled or ground into smaller particles.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, mere is provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.<br><br><br>
The amount of compound of the invention which is employed in such a formulation will depend on the condition, and patient, to be treated, as well as the compound(s) which is/are employed, but can be determined non-inventively.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful because they are metabolised<br>
in the body following administration to form compounds which possess<br>
pharmacological    activity.	They    are     therefore     indicated    as<br>
pharmaceuticals, and in particular as prodrugs of pharmacologically-active compounds.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the invention, although inactive to thrombin per se, are metabolised in the body to form potent inhibitors of thrombin, for example as demonstrated in the tests described in WO 97/23499. The compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of conditions where inhibition of thrombin is required or desirable, including those described in WO 97/23499, the disclosure in which document is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Suitable doses of the compound of the invention in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of mammalian, especially human, patients are in the range 2 to 200 mg per day at peroral adrninistration, and 1 to 100 mg per day at parenteral administration and/or 0.001 to 20 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, body weight per day at peroral administration and 0.0005 to 10 mg/kg, preferably 0.005 to 2.5 mg/kg, body weight at parenteral administration.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treatment of a condition where inhibition of thrombin is required or<br><br>
desired, which method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a patient in need of such /treatment.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, by "treatment" we include the therapeutic treatment, as well as the prophylaxis, of a condition.<br>
The compounds of the invention have the advantage that they are in a form which provides for improved ease of handling. Further, the compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be produced in forms which have improved chemical and solid state stability (including lower hygroscopicity). Thus, the compounds may be stable when stored over prolonged periods.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be crystallised in good yields, in a higher purity, in less time, more conveniently, and at a lower cost, than forms of Et02C-CH2-(R)CgI-Aze-Pab-OH prepared previously.<br>
The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited, by the following examples, with reference to the enclosed figures in which:<br>

General Procedures<br>
X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) was performed on samples prepared according to standard methods, for example those described in Giacovazzo, C. et al (1995), Fundamentals of Crystallography, Oxford University Press; Jenkins, R. and Snyder, R. L. (1996), Introduction to X-Ray Powder Dijfractomeiry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or Klug, H. P. &amp; Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, 3onn Wiley and Sons, New York. X-ray analyses were performed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer and/or a Philips X"Pert MPD.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a Mettler DSC820 instrument, according to standard methods, for example those described in Hohne, G. W. H. et al (1996), Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Springer, Berlin.<br><br><br>
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA850 instrument.<br>
Forms prepared in accordance with the Examples below showed "essentially" the same XRPD diffraction patterns and/or DSC and/or TGA thermograms as other Examples disclosed below, when it was clear from the relevant patterns/thermograms (allowing for experimental error) that the same crystalline form had been formed. Thus, DSC onset temperatures may vary in the range ±5°C (e.g. ±2°C), and XRPD distance values may vary in the range ±2 on the last decimal place.<br>
