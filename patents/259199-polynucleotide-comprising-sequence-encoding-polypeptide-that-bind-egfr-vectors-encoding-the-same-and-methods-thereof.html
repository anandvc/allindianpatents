ANTIGEN BINDING MOLECULES THAT BIND EGFR, VECTORS ENCODING SAME, AND USES THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to antigen binding molecules (ABMs). In particular embodiments, the present invention relates to recombinant monoclonal antibodies, including chimeric, primatized or humanized antibodies specific for human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, the present invention relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding such ABMs, and vectors and host cells comprising such nucleic acid molecules. The invention further relates to methods for producing the ABMs of the invention, and to methods of using these ABMs in'treatment of disease. In addition, the present invention relates to ABMs with modified glycosylation having improved therapeutic properties, including antibodies with increased Fc recqjtor binding and increased effector function.<br>
Background Art<br>
EGFR and Anti-EGFR Antibodies<br>
Human epidermal growth factor receptor (also known as HER-1 or Erb-Bl, and referred to herein as "EGFR") is a 170 kDa transmembrane receptor encoded by the c-erbB protooncogene, and exhibits intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (Modjtahedi et aL, Br. J. Cancer 73:228-235 (1996); Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)), SwissProt database entry P00533 provides the sequence of EGFR.   There are also isoforms and variants of EGFR (e.g., alternative RNA transcripts, truncated versions, polymorphisms, etc.) including but not limited to those identified by Swissprot database entry numbers P00533-1, P00533-2, P00533-3, and P00533-4.      EGFR is known to bind ligands including epidemial growth  factor (EGF), transforming growth  factor-a (TGf-a), amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF (hb-EGF), betacellulin, and epiregulin (Herbst an Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002); Mendelsohn and Baselga, Oncogene 79:6550-6/ (2000)). EGFR regulates numerous cellular processes via tyrosine-kinase mediated, transduction pathways, including, but not limited to, activation of signal tranf<br><br>
pathways that control cell proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, mitogenesis, and metastasis (Atalay et ai. Ann. Oncology 14:1346-1363 (2003); Tsao and Herbst, Signal 4:4-9 (2003); Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002); Modjtahedi et aL, Br, J, Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)).<br>
Overexpression of EGFR has been reported in numerous human malignant conditions, including cancers of the bladder, brain, head and neck, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, and kidney. (Atalay et ai, Ann, Oncology 14:1346-1363 (2003); Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002) Modjtahedi et aL, Br, J, Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)). In many of these conditions, the overexpression of EGFR correlates or is associated with poor prognosis of the patients. (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002) Modjtahedi et aL, Br. /. Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)). EGFR is also expressed in the cells of normal tissues, particularly the epithelial tissues of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, although at generally lower levels than in malignant cells (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)).<br>
Unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be useful medicines for the treatment of cancer, as demonstrated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Trastuzumab (HerceptinTM; Genentech Inc,) for the treatment of advanced breast cancer (Grillo-Lopez, A.-J., et aL, Semin, Oncol. 26:66-73 (1999); Goldenberg, M. M., Clin, Ther. 27:309-18 (1999)), Rituximab (Rituxan™; IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, and Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA), for the treatment of CD20 positive B-cell, low-grade or follicular Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Gemtuzumab (Mylotarg'^'**, Celltech/Wyeth-Ayerst) for the treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, and Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH™, Millenium Pharmaceuticals/Schering AG) for the treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The success of these products relies not only on their efficacy but also on their outstanding safety profiles (Grillo-Lopez, AJ., et al, Semin, Oncol 26:66-73 (1999); Goldenberg, M. M., Clin, Ther, 27:309-18 (1999)). In spite of the achievements of these drugs, there is currently a large interest in obtaining higher specific antibody activity than what is typically afforded by unconjugated mAb therapy.<br>
The results of a number of studies suggest that Fc-receptor-dependent mechanisms contribute substantially to the action of cytotoxic antibodies against tumors and indicate that an optimal antibody against tumors would bind preferentially to activation Fc<br><br>
receptors and minimally to the inhibitory partner FcyRIIB. (Clynes, R. A., et aL, Nature Medicine 6(4):443'446 (2000); Kalergis, A,M., and Ravetch, J. V., J. Exp, Med, I95(I2):1653A659 (June 2002). For example, the results of at least one study suggest that polymorphism in the FcyRIIIa receptor, in particular, is strongly associated with the efficacy of antibody therapy. (Cartron, G., et aL, Blood 99(3):1SA'151 (February 2002)). That study showed that patients homozygous for FcyRIIIa have a better response to Rituximab than heterozygous patients. The authors concluded that the superior response was due to better in vivo binding of the antibody to FcyRIIIa, which resulted in better ADCC activity against lymphoma cells. (Cartron, G., et aL, Blood 99(3):15A-151 (February 2002)).<br>
Various strategies to target EGFR and block EGFR signaling pathways have been reported. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors like gefitinib, erlotinib, and CI-1033 block autophosphorylation of EGFR in the intracellular tyrosine kinase region, thereby inhibiting downstream signaling events (Tsao and Herbst, Signal 4: 4-9 (2003)). Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, target the extracellular portion of EGFR, which results in blocking ligand binding and thereby inhibits downstream events such as cell proliferation (Tsao and Herbst, Signal 4: 4-9 (2003)).<br>
Several murine monoclonal antibodies have been generated which achieve such a block in vitro and which have been evaluated for their ability to affect tumor growth in mouse xenograft models (Masui, et aL, Cancer Res. 46:5592-5598 (1986); Masui, et al.y Cancer Res. 44:1002-1007 (1984); Goldsteia et ai, Clin. Cancer Res. I: 1311-1318 (1995)). For example, EMD 55900 (EMD Pharmaceuticals) is a murine anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that was raised against human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 and was tested in clinical studies of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx (Bier et ai, Eur, Arch, OtohinolaryngoL 252:433-9 (1995)). In addition, the rat monoclonal antibodies IC3116, ICR62, and ICR80, which bind the extracellular domain of EGFR, have been shown to be effective at inhibiting the binding of EGF and TGF-a the receptor. (Modjtahedi et ai. Int. J. Cancer 75:310-316 (1998)). The murine monoclonal antibody 425 is another MAb that was raised against the human A431 carcinoma cell line and was found to bind to a polypeptide epitope on the external domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor. (Murthy et al., Arch. Biochem, Biophys, 252(2)1:549-560 (1987).  A potential problem with the use of murine antibodies<br><br>
in therapeutic treatments is that non-human monoclonal antibodies can be recognized by the human host as a foreign protein; therefore, repeated injections of such foreign antibodies can lead to the induction of immune responses leading to harmful hypersensitivity reactions. For murine-based monoclonal antibodies, this is often referred to as a Human Anti-Mouse Antibody response, or "HAMA" response, or a Human Anti-Rat Antibody, or "KARA" response. Additionally, these "foreign" antibodies can_be attacked by the immime system of the host such that they are, in effect, neutralized before they reach their target site. Furthermore, non-human monoclonal antibodies (e.g., murine monoclonal antibodies) typically lack human effector functionality, i.e., they are unable to, inter alia, mediate complement dependent lysis or lyse human target cells through antibody dependent cellular toxicity or Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis.<br>
Chimeric antibodies comprising portions of antibodies from two or more different species (e.g., mouse and human) have been developed as an alternative to "conjugated" antibodies. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,891,996 (Mateo de Acosta del Rio et aL) discusses a mouse/human chimeric antibody, R3, directed against EGFR, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,864 discusses generation of chimeric and humanized forms of the murine anti-EGFR MAb 425. Also, IMC-C225 (Erbitux®; hnClone) is a chimeric mouse/human anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (based on mouse M225 monoclonal antibody, which resulted in HAMA responses in human clinical trials) that has been reported to demonstrate antitumor efficacy in various human xenograft models. (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)). The efficacy of IMC-C225 has been attributed to several mechanisms, including inhibition of cell events regulated by EGFR signaling pathways, and possibly by increased antibody-dependent cellular toxicity (ADCC) activity (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)). IMC-C225 was also used in clinical trials, including in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611(2002)). Recently, Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, CA) developed ABX-EGF for cancer therapy. ABX-EGF is a fully human anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. (Yang et ai, Crit. Rev, OncolJHematoL 38: 17-23 (2001)).<br>
Antibody Glycosylation<br>
The oligosaccharide component can significantly affect properties relevant to the efficacy of a therapeutic glycoprotein, including physical stability, resistance to protease attack, interactions with the immune system, pharmacokinetics, and specific biological<br><br>
activity. Such properties may depend not only on the presence or absence, but also on the specific structures, of oligosaccharides. Some generalizations between oligosaccharide structure and glycoprotein function can be made. For example, certain oligosaccharide structures mediate rapid clearance of the glycoprotein from the bloodstream through interactions with specific carbohydrate binding proteins, while others can be bound by antibodies and trigger undesired immune reactions. (Jenkins et al, Nature Biotechnol. 14:975-81 (1996)).<br>
Mammalian cells are the preferred hosts for production of therapeutic glycoproteins, due to their capability to glycosylate proteins in the most compatible form for human application. (Cunaming et al, Glycobiology 7:115-30 (1991); Jenkins et al, Nature Biotechnol 14:975-81 (1996)). Bacteria very rarely glycosylate protems, and like other types of common hosts, such as yeasts, filamentous fimgi, insect and plant cells, yield glycosylation patterns associated with rapid clearance from the blood stream, undesirable immune interactions, and in some specific cases, reduced biological activity. Among mammalian cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have been most commonly used during the last two decades. In addition to giving suitable glycosylation patterns, these cells allow consistent generation of genetically stable, highly productive clonal cell lines. They can be cultured to high densities in simple bioreactors using serum-free media, and permit the development of safe and reproducible bioprocesses. Other commonly used animal cells include baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, NSO- and SP2/0-mouse myeloma cells. More recently, production fi-om transgenic animals has also been tested. {Jchkins et al, Nature BiotechnoL 14:975-81(1996)).<br>
all antibodies contain carbohydrate structures at conserved positions in the heavy chain constant regions, with each isotype possessing a distinct array of N-linked carbohydrate structures, which variably affect protein assembly, secretion or functional activity. (Wright, A„ and Morrison, S. L., Trends Biotech. 15:26-32 (1997)). The structure of the attached N-linked carbohydrate varies considerably, depending on the degree of processing, and can include high-mannose, multiply-branched as well as biantennary complex oligosaccharides. (Wright, A., and Morrison, S. L, Trends Biotech. 75:26-32 (1997)). Typically, there is heterogeneous processing of the core oligosaccharide stmctures attached at a particular glycosylation site such that even monoclonal antibodies exist as multiple glycoforms.   Likewise, it has been shown that<br><br>
major differences in antibody glycosylation occur between cell lines, and even minor differences are seen for a given cell line grown under different culture conditions. (Lifely, M. R. et al, Glycobiology 5(8):813-122 (1995)).<br>
One way to obtain large increases in potency, while maintaining a simple production process and potentially avoiding significant, undesirable side effects, is to enhance the natural, cell-mediated effector functions of monoclonal antibodies by engineering their oligosaccharide component as described in Umania, P, et al, Nature BiotechnoL 77:176-180 (1999) and U.S. Pat No. 6,602,684, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. IgGI type antibodies, the most commonly used antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, are glycoproteins that have a conserved N-linked glycosylation site at Asn297 in each CH2 domain. The two complex biantennary oligosaccharides attached to Asn297 are buried between the CH2 domains, forming extensive contacts with the polypeptide backbone, and their presence is essential for the antibody to mediate effector functions such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Lifely, M. R., et al, Glycobiology 5:813-822 (1995); Jefferis, R., et ai, Immunol Rev. 763:59-76 (1998); Wright, A. and Morrison, S. L., Trends BiotechnoL 75:26-32(1997)).<br>
Umafia et al. showed previously that overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells of β(1,4)'N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III ("GnTIII"), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing the formation of bisected oligosaccharides, significantly increases the in vitro ADCC activity of an anti-neuroblastoma chimeric monoclonal antibody (chCE7) produced by the engineered CHO cells. {See Umana, P. et al, Nature BiotechnoL 77:176-180 (1999); and International Publication No. WO 99/54342, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). The antibody chCE7 belongs to a large class of unconjugated mAbs which have high tumor affinity and specificity, but have too little potency to be clinically useful when produced in standard industrial cell lines lacking the GnTIII enzyme (Umana, P., et al. Nature BiotechnoL 77:176-180 (1999)). That study was the first to show that large mcreases of ADCC activity could be obtained by engineering the antibody-producing cells to express GnTin, which also led to an increase in the proportion of constant region (Fc)-associated, bisected oligosaccharides, including bisected, nonfucosylated oligosaccharides, above the levels found in naturally-occurring antibodies.<br><br>
There remains a need for enhanced therapeutic approaches targeting EGFR for the treatment of cell proliferation disorders in primates, including, but not limited to, humans, wherein such disorders are characterized by EGFR expression, particularly abnormal expression (e.g., overxpression) including, but not limited to, cancers of the bladder, brain, head and neck, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, and kidney.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recognizing the tremendous therapeutic potential of antigen binding molecules (ABMs) that have the binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody (e.g., bind the same epitope) and that have been glycoenginecred to enhance Fc receptor binding affinity and effector function, the present inventors developed a method for producing such ABMs. Inter alia, this method involves producing recombinant, chimeric antibodies or chimeric fragments thereof The efficacy of these ABMs is further enhanced by engineering the glycosylation profile of the antibody Fc region.<br>

As used herein, the terms overexpress, overexpressed, and overexpressing, as used in connection with cells expressing EGFR, refer to cells which have measurably higher levels of EGFR on the surface thereof compared to a nomial cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. EGFR expression (and, hence, overexpression) may be detennined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating levels of EGFR present on the suface of a cell or in a cell  lysate by techniques that are known in the art:  e.g., via an<br><br>
immunohistochemistry assay, immunofluorescence assay, immunoenzyme assay, ELISA, flow cytometry, radioimmunoassay, Western blot, ligand binding, kinase activity, etc. (See generally, CELL BIOLOGY: A LABORATORY HANDBOOK, Celis, J., ed., Academic Press (2d ed., 1998); CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN PROTEIN SCIENCE, Coligan, J.E. et al,, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons (1995-2003); see also, Sumitomo et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 10: 794-801 (2004) (describing Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemstry) the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference)). alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of EGFR-encoding nucleic acid molecules in the cell, e,g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization, Southern blotting, or PCR techniques. The levels of EGFR in normal cells are compared to the levels of cells affected by a cell proliferation disorder (e,g., cancer) to detennine if EGFR is overexpressed.<br>
As used herein, the term antigen binding molecule refers in its broadest sense to a molecule that specifically binds an antigenic determinant. More specifically, an antigen binding molecule that binds EGFR is a molecule which specifically binds to a transmembrane receptor of 170 kDa, typically designated as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but also known as HER-1 or ErbBl. By "specifically binds" is meant that the binding is selective for the antigen and can be discriminated from unwanted or nonspecific interactions.<br>
As used herein, the terms fusion and chimeric, when used in reference to polypeptide such as ABMs refer to polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences derived from two or more heterologous polypeptides, such as portions of antibodies from different species. For chimeric ABMs, for example, the non-antigen binding components may be derived from a wide variety of species, including primates such as chimpanzees and humans. The constant region of the chimeric ABM is most preferably substantially identical to the constant region of a natural human antibody the variable region of the chimeric antibody is most preferably substantially identical to that of a recombinant anti-EGFR antibody having the amino acid sequence of the murine variable region. Humanized antibodies are a particularly preferred form of fusion or chimeric antibody.<br>
As used herein, a polypeptide having GnTIII activity refers to polypeptides that are able to catalyze the addition of a N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue in P-1-4 linkage to the p-linked mannoside of the trimannosyl core of N-linked oligosaccharides. This includes fusion polypeptides exhibiting enzymatic activity similar to, but not<br><br>
necessarily identical to, an activity of P(l,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase HI, also known as P-l,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-beta-N-acetylglucosatninyl-transferase (EC 2.4.1.144), according to the Nomenclature Committee of the hitemational Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of GnTIII, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the GnTIII (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the GnTIII.)<br>
As used herein, the term variant (or analog) refers to a polypeptide differing from a specifically recited polypeptide of the invention by amino acid insertions, deletions, and substitutions, created using, eg., recombinant DNA techniques. Variants of the.ABMs of the present invention include chimeric, primatized or humanized antigen binding molecules wherein one or several of the amino acid residues are modified by substitution, addition and/or deletion in such manner that does not substantially affect antigen (e.g., EGFR) binding afEinity. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be replaced, added or deleted without aboUshing activities of interest, may be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polypeptide with that of homologous peptides and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or by replacing amino acids with consensus sequence.<br>
alternatively, recombinant variants encoding these same or similar polypeptides may be synthesized or selected by making use of the "redundancy" in the genetic code. Various codon substitutions, such as the silent changes which produce various restriction sites, may be introduced to optimize cloning into a plasmid or viral vector or expression in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic system. Mutations in the polynucleotide sequence may be reflected in the polypeptide or domains of other peptides added to the polypeptide to modify the properties of any part of the polypeptide, to change characteristics such as ligand-binding affinities, interchain affinities, or degradation/turnover rate.<br>
Preferably, amino acid "substitutions" are the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, i.e.,<br><br>
conservative amino acid replacements. "Conservative" amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example, nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine; polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; and negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. "Insertions" or "deletions" are preferably in the range of about 1 to 20 amino acids, more preferably 1 to 10 amino acids. The variation allowed may be experimentally determined by systematically making insertions, deletions, or substitutions of amino acids in a polypeptide molecule using recombinant DNA techniques and assaying the resulting recombinant variants for activity.<br>
As used herein, the term humanized is used to refer to an antigen-binding molecule derived from a non-human antigen-binding molecule, for example, a murine antibody, that retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parent molecule but which is less immunogenic in humans. This may be achieved by various methods including (a) grafting the entire non-human variable domains onto human constant regions to generate chimeric antibodies, (b) grafting only the non-human CDRs onto human framework and constant regions with or without retention of critical framework residues (e.g., those that are important for retaining good antigen binding affinity or antibody functions), or (c) transplanting the entire non-human variable domains, but "cloaking" them with a human-like section by replacement of surface residues. Such methods are disclosed in Jones et al., Morrison et al., Proc. Natl Acad. ScL 81:6851-6855 (1984); Morrison and Oi, Adv. ImmunoL, 44:65-92 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988); Padlan, Molec. Immun., 28:489-498 (1991); Padlan, Molec. Immun., 3l(3):169-217 (1994), all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. There are generally 3 complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, (CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3) in each of the heavy and light chain variable domains of an antibody, which are flanked by four framework subregions (i.e., FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4) in each of the heavy and light chain variable domains of an antibody: FRl-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4. A discussion of humanized antibodies can be found,<br><br>
inter alia, in U.S. Patent No. 6,632,927, and in published U.S. Application No, 2003/0175269, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Similarly, as used herein, the term primatized is used to refer to an antigen-binding molecule derived from a non-primate antigen-binding molecule, for example, a murine antibody, that retains or substantially retains the antigen-binding properties of the parent molecule but which is less immunogenic in primates.<br>
In the case where there are two or more definitions of a term which is used and/or accepted within the art, the definition of the temi as used herein is intended to include all such meanings unless explicitly stated to the contrary. A specific example is the use of the term "complementarity determining region" ("CDR") to describe the non-contiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. This particular region has been described by Kabat et al., U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, "Sequences of Proteins of Inununological Interest" (1983) and by Chothia et al., J. MoL Biol. 196:901-917 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference, where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. Nevertheless, application of either definition to refer to a CDR of an antibody or variants thereof is intended to be within the scope of the term as defined and used herein. The appropriate amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth below in Table I as a comparison. The exact residue numbers which encompass a particular CDR will vary deprading on the sequence and size of the CDR. Those skilled in the art can routinely determine which residues comprise a particular CDR given the variable region amino acid sequence of the antibody.<br><br>
Numbering of all CDR definitions in Table 1 is according to the numbering conventions set forth by Kabat et al. (see below).<br><br>
 "AbM" refers to the CDRs as defined by Oxford Molecular's "AbM" antibody modeling software.<br>
Kabat et al. also defined a numbering system for variable domain sequences that is applicable to any antibody. One of ordinary skill in the art can unambigously assign this system of "Kabat numbering" to any variable domain sequence, without reliance on any experimental data beyond the sequence itself As used herein, "Kabat numbering" refers to the numbering system set forth by Kabat et al., U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services, "Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest" (1983). Unless otherwise specified, references to the numbering of specific amino acid residue positions in an ABM are according to the Kabat numbering system. The sequences of the sequence listing (i.e., SEQ ID N0:1 to SEQ ID NO:127) are not numbered according to the Kabat numbering system. However, as stated above, it is well within the ordinary skill of one in the art to determine the Kabat numbering scheme of any variable region sequence in the Sequence Listing based on the numbering of the sequences as presented therein.<br>
By a nucleic acid or polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for<br>
example, 95% "identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence of the present invention, it is<br>
intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference<br>
sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations<br>
per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to obtain a<br>
polynucleotide havmg a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference<br>
nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be<br>
deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the<br>
total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence.<br>
)	As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide<br>
is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence or polypeptide sequence of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al, Comp. App, BioscL (5:237-245 (1990). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting Us to T's.<br><br>
The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are: Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=l, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=l, Gap Penalty==5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter.<br>
If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5' or 3' deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5* and 3' truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5' or 3' ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5' and 3* of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence aligmnent. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5' and 3' bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.<br>
For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5' end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10 bases at S* end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the S' and 3* ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted fiom the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. hi another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are intemal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5* or 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5' and 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query<br><br>
sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.<br>
By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.<br>
As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a reference polypeptide can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also refenred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et aly Comp, App, BioscL (J:237-245 (1990). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2. Mismatch Penalty=l, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=l, Window Size=sequence length. Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter.<br>
If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent<br><br>
identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-tennini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence.<br>
For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C- termini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to be made for the purposes of the present invention.<br>

As used herein, the term Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity includes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cellular cytotoxicity mediated by a soluble Fc-fusion protein containing a human Fc-region, It is an immune mechanism leading to the lysis of "antibody-targeted cells" by "human immune effector cells", wherein:<br>
The human immune effector cells are a population of leukocytes that display Fc receptors on their surface through which they bind to the Fc-region of antibodies or of refusion proteins and perform effector functions. Such a population may include, but is not limited to, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or natural killer (NK) cells.<br>

The increase in Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity is relative to the cellular cytotoxicity mediated by the same antibody, or Fc-fusion protein, produced by the same type of host cells, using the same standard production, purification, formulation and storage methods, which are known to those skilled in the art, but that has not been produced by host cells engineered to express the glycosyltransferase Gnllll by the methods described herein.<br>
By antibody having increased antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is meant an antibody, as that term is defined herein, having increased ADCC as determined by any suitable method known to those of ordinary skill in the art. One accepted in vitro ADCC assay is as follows;<br><br>

2)	the assay uses human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from blood of a randomly chosen healthy donor, as effector cells;<br>
3)	the assay is carried out according to following protocol:<br>
i) the PBMCs are isolated using standard density centrifugation procedures and are suspended at 5 x 10 cells/ml in RPMI cell culture medium;<br>
ii) the target cells are grown by standard tissue culture methods, harvested from the exponential growth phase with a viability higher than 90%, washed in RPMI cell culture mediuna, labeled with 100 micro-Curies of 51Cr, washed twice with cell culture medium, and resuspended in cell culture medium at a density of IDS cells/ml;<br>

The increase in ADCC is relative to the ADCC, measured with the above assay, mediated by the same antibody, produced by the same type of host cells, using the same standard production, purification, formulation and storage methods, which are known to those skilled in the art, but that has not been produced by host cells engineered to overexpress GnTUI.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is related to antigen binding molecules having the binding specificity of the rat ICR62 (i.e., binds to substantially the same epitope), and to the discovery that their effector functions can be enhanced by altered glycosylation. In one embodiment, the antigen binding molecule is a chimeric antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to a chimeric antibody, or a fragment thereof, comprising one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, or six) of the the CDRs of any of SEQ ID NOs:53-108 and/or SEQ ID NO:s 122-127. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising: (a) a sequence selected ftom a group consisting of: SEQ ID NO:54 SEQ ID NO:56, SEQ ID NO:58, SEQ K) NO:60, SEQ ID NO:62, SEQ ID NO:64, SEQ ID NO:66. SEQ ID NO:68, SEQ JD NO:70, SEQ ID NO:72, SEQ JD NO:74, SEQ ID NO:122, and SEQ ID NO: 124; (b) a sequence selected fix)m a group consisting of: SEQ ID NO:76, SEQ ID NO:78, SEQ ED NO:80, SEQ ID NO:82, SEQ JD NO:84, SEQ ID NO:86, SEQ JD NO:88, SEQ ID NO:90, SEQ ID NO:92, SEQ JD NO:94, SEQ ID NO:96, SEQ ID NO:98, SEQ JD NO;100, SEQ ID NO:102, SEQ JD NO:104, SEQ JD NO:106, and SEQ ID NO:126; and (c) SEQ ID NO:108. In another preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising (a) a sequence selectd from the group<br><br>
consisting of SEQ ID NO:112 and SEQ ID N0:114; (b) a sequence selectd from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 116 and SEQ ID NO: 118; and (c) SEQ ID NO: 119. In one embodiment, any of these polynucleotides encodes a fusion polypeptide.<br>
In another embodiment, the antigen binding molecule comprises the VH domain of the rat ICR62 antibody encoded by SEQ ID N0:1 or SEQ ID N0:2, or a variant thereof; and a non-murine polypeptide. In another preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to an antigen binding molecule comprising the VL domain of the rat antibody encoded by SEQ ID NO:43 or SEQ ED NO:44, or a variant thereof; and a non-murine polypeptide.<br>
hi another aspect, the invention is directed to antigen binding molecules comprising one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, or six) truncated CDRs of ICR62. Such truncated CDRs will contain, at a minimum, the specificity-determining amino acid residues for the given CDR. By "specificity-determining residue" is meant those residues that are directly involved in the interaction with the antigen. In general, only about one-fifth to one-third of the residues in a given CDR participate in binding to antigen. The specificity-determining residues in a particular CDR can be identified by, for example, computation of interatomic contacts from three-dimensional modeling and determination of the sequence variability at a given residue position in accordance with the methods described in Padlan et al, FASEB J. 9(1):133'139 (1995), the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is also directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising at least one (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, or six) complementarity determining region of the rat ICR62 antibody, or a variant or truncated form thereof containing at least the specificity-determining residues for said complementarity determining region, wherein said isolated polynucleotide encodes a fusion polypeptide. Preferably, such isolated polynucleotides encode a fusion polypetide that is an antigen binding molecule. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide comprises three complementarity determining regions of the rat ICR62 antibody, or variants or truncated forms thereof containing at least .the specificity-determining residues for each of said three complementarity determining regions. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide comprises at least one of the CDRs set forth in Tables 2-5, below. In another embodiment, the polynucleotide encodes the entire variable region of the light or heavy<br><br>
chain of a chimeric (e.g., humanized) antibody.  The invention is further directed to the polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is directed to an antigen binding molecule comprising at least one (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, or six) complementarity determining region of the rat ICR62 antibody, or a variant or truncated form thereof containing at least the specificity-determining residues for said complementarity determining region, and comprising a sequence derived from a heterologous polypeptide. In one embodiment, the antigen binding molecule comprises three complementarity determining regions of the rat ICR62 antibody, or variants or truncated forms thereof containing at least the specificity-determining residues for each of said three complementarity determining regions. In one embodimeat, the antigen binding molecule comprises at least one of the CDRs set forth in Tables 2-S, below. In another aspect, the antigen binding molecule comprises the variable region of an antibody light or heavy chain. In one particularly useful embodiment, the antigen binding molecule is a chimeric, e.g., humanized, antibody. The invention is also directed to methods of making such antigen binding molecules, and the use of same in the treatment of disease, particularly cell proliferation disorders wherein EGFR is expressed, particularly wherein EGFR is abnonnally expressed (e.g., overexpressed) compared to normal tissue of the same cell type. Such disorders include, but are not limited to cancers of the bladder, brain, head and neck, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, skin, and kidney. EGFR expression levels may be determined by methods known in the art and those described herein (e.g., via immunohistochemistry assay, immunofluorescence assay, immuoenzyme assay, ELISA, flow cytometry, radioimmunoassay, Westem blot, ligand binding, kinase activity, etc.).<br>
The invention is also directed to a mediod for targeting in vivo or in vitro cells expressing EGFR. Cells that express EGFR may be targeted for therapuetic purposes (e,g., to treat a disorder that is treatable by disruption of EGFR-mediated signaling, for example by blocking ligand binding, or by targeting EGFR-expressing cells for destruction by the immune system). In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for targeting cells expressing EGFR in a subject comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising an ABM of the invention. Cells that express EGFR may also be targeted for diagnositic pinposes (e.g., to determine if they are expressing<br><br>
EGFR, either nonnally or abnonnally). Thus, the invention is also directed to methods for detecting the presence of EGFR or a cell expressing EGFR, either in vivo or in vitro. One method of detecting EGFR expression according to the present invention comprises contacting a sample to be tested, optionally with a control sample, with an ABM of the present invention, under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between the ABM and EGFR. The complex formation is then detected (e.g., by ELISA or other methods known in the art). When using a control sample with the test sample,any statistically significant difference in the formation of ABM-EGFR complexes when comparing the test and control samples is indicative of the presence of EGFR in the test sample.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0116]	It is known that several mechanism are involved in the therapeutic efficacy of<br>
anti-EGFR antibodies, including blocking of ligand (e.g., EGF, TGF-a, etc.) binding to EGFR and subsequent activation of signaling pathways, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the induction of growth arrest or terminal differentiation.<br>
[0117]	The rat monoclonal antibody ICR62 (IgG2b) was discussed in PCT Publication<br>
No. WO 95/20045, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. It was directed to the C epitope of EGFR, and was shown to inhibit ligand binding, inhibit<br><br>
growth in vitro of squamous cell carcinomas expressing EGFR, and induce regression of xenografts of tumors in athymic mice (WO 95/20045; Modjtahedi et al, Br. J. Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)). As a fully rodent antibody, administration of ICR62 rat monoclonal antibody to humans resulted a HARA response in some patients following even a single dose. (WO 95/20045; Modjtahedi et ai, Br. / Cancer 73:228-235 (1996)).<br>
Chimeric mouse/human antibodies have been described. See, for example, Morrison, S, L. et al., PNAS 11:6851-6854 (November 1984); European Patent Publication No. 173494; Boulianna, G. L, et ai. Nature 312:642 (December 1984); Neubeiger, M. S. et al., Nature 314:268 (March 1985); European Patent Publication No. 125023; Tan et al„ /. Immunol 135:8564 (November 1985); Sun, L. K et al„ Hybridoma 5(1):517 (1986); Sahagan et al, J. Immunol 137:1066-1074 (1986). See generally, Muron, Nature 312:597 (December 1984); Dickson, Genetic Engineering News 5(3) (March 1985); Maix, Science 229:455 (August 1985); and Morrison, Science 229:1202-1207 (September 1985). IMC-C225 (Erbitux®, Imclone) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR and having a mouse variable region and a human constant region {See Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94: 1593-1611 (2002)). The murine portion of IMC-225 is derived from M225, which was found to bind EGFR and inhibit EGF-induced tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation, as well as inducing apoptosis in tumor cell lines over-expressing EGFR (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)). However, M225 elicited a HAMA reaction in patients treated with the antibody in Phase I clinical tials (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94: 1593-1611 (2002)). IMC-225 has been tested in vivo and in vitrOy and has been used in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy in a number of tumor types, including those associated with poor prognosis (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94: 1593-1611 (2002)). However, IMC-225 has been associated with toxicities such as allergic and skin reactions in patients administered the IMC-225 antibody in clincial trials (Herbst and Shin, Cancer 94:1593-1611 (2002)).<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the chimeric ABM of the present invention is a hmnanized antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are known in the art. For example, humanized ABMs of the present invention can be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat No. 5,225,539 to Winter, U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,370 to Queen et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,927 to Adair et al, or U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2003/0039649 to Foote, the entire contents of each of which is herein incorporated by<br><br>
reference. Preferably, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (Jones et al., Nature, 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al, Nature, 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al. Science, 239:1534-1536 (1988)), by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such "humanized" antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. The subject humanized anti-EGFR antibodies will comprise constant regions of human immunoglobulin.<br>
The choice of human variable domains, both light and heavy, to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so-called "best-fit" method, the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable-domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human fiximework region (FR) for the hxmianized antibody (Sims et al., /. ImmunoLj 151:2296 (1993); Chothia et al., J. MoL Biol., 196:901 (1987)). Another method of selecting the human framework sequence is to compare the sequence of each individual subregion of the full rodent fi-amework (i.e,, FRl, FR2, FR3, and FR4) or some combination of the individual subregions (e.g., FRl and FR2) against a library of known human variable region sequences that correspond to that framework subregion (e.g., as determined by Kabat numbering), and choose the human sequence for each subregion or combination that is the closest to that of the rodent (Leimg, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0040606al, published Feb. 27, 2003) (the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference). Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies (Carter et al., Proc. Nati Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285 (1992); Presta et al, /<br><br>
ImmunoL, 151:2623 (1993)) (the entire contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference).<br>
It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, according to a preferred method,, humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three-dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models can be generated using computer programs familiar to those skilled in the art (e.g., Insightn, Accekys, Inc. (formerly MSI), or at http:/swissmodelexpasy.org). These computer programs can illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences, bispection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobului sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.<br>
In one embodiment, .the antibodies of the present invention comprise a human Fc region. In a specific embodiment, the human constant region is IgGi, as set forth in SEQ ID NOs 109 and 110, and set forth below:<br>

However, variants and isoforms of the human Fc region are also encompassed by the present invention. For example, variant Fc regions suitable for use in the present invention can be produced according to the methods taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056 to Presta (Fc region variants with altered effector fimction due to one or more amino acid modifications); or in U.S. Pat. Appl. Nos, 60/439,498; 60/456,041; 60/514,549; or WO 2004/063351 (variant Fc regions Avith increased binding affinity due to amino acid modification); or in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 10/672,280 or WO 2004/099249 (Fc variants with altered binding to FcyR due to amino acid modification), the contents of each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In another embodiment, the antigen binding molecules of the present invention are engineered to have enhanced binding affinity according to, for example, the methods disclosed in U,S, Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0132066 to Balint et al, the entke contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the antigen binding molecule of the present invention is conjugated to an additional moiety, such as a radiolabel or a toxin. Such conjugated ABMs can be produced by numerous methods that are well known in the art.<br>
A variety of radionuclides are applicable to the present invention and those skilled in the art are credited with the ability to readily determine which radionuclide is most appropriate under a variety of circumstances. For example, 131Modine is a well known radionuclide used for targeted immunotherapy. However, the clinical usefulness of Modine can be limited by several factors including: eight-day physical half-life; dehalogenation of iodinated antibody both in the blood and at tumor sites; and emission characteristics (e.g., large gamma component) which can be suboptimal for localized dose<br><br>
deposition in tumor. With the advent of superior chelating agents, the opportunity for attaching metal chelating groups to proteins has increased the opportunities to utilize other radionuclides such as 111indium and 90yttrium. Yttrium provides several benefits for utilization in radioimmunotherapeutic applications: the 64 hour half-life of 90yttrium is long enough to allow antibody accumulation by tumor and, unlike e.g., 131iodine, ^yttrium is a pure beta emitter of high energy with no accompanying gamma irradiation in its decay, with a range in tissue of 100 to 1000 cell diameters. Furtheraiore, the minimal amount of penetrating radiation allows for outpatient administiation of 90yttrium-labeled antibodies. Additionally, internalization of labeled antibody is not required for cell killing, and the local emission of ionizing radiation should be lethal for adjacent tumor cells lacking the target antigen.<br>
Effective single treatment dosages (i.e., therapeutically effective amounts) of 90yttrium labeled anti-EGFR antibodies range from between about 5 and about 75 mCi, more preferably between about 10 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of 131iodine labeled anti-EGFR antibodies range from between about 5 and about 70 mCi, more preferably between about 5 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment ablative dosages (i.e., may require autologous bone marrow transplantation) of 131'iodine labeled anti-EGFR antibodies range from between about 30 and about 600 mCi, more preferably between about SO and less than about 500 mCi. In conjunction with a chimeric anti-EGFR antibody, owing to the longer circulating half life vis-A- vis murine antibodies, an effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of 131iodine labeled chimeric anti-EGFR antibodies range from between about 5 and about 40 mCi, more preferably less than about 30 mCi. Imaging criteria for, e.g., the 111indium label, are typically less than about 5 mCi.<br>
With respect to radiolabeled anti-EGFR antibodies, therapy therewith can also occur using a single therapy treatment or using multiple treatments. Because of the radionuclide component, it is preferred that prior to treatment, peripheral stem cells ('TSC") or bone marrow ("BM") be "harvested" for patients experiencing potentially fatal bone marrow toxicity resulting from radiation. BM and/or PSC are harvested using standard techniques, and then purged and frozen for possible reinfusion. Additionally, it is most preferred that prior to treatment a diagnostic dosimetry study using a diagnostic labeled antibody (e.g., using " 'indium) be conducted on the patient, a purpose of which is<br><br>
to ensure that the therapeutically labeled antibody (e.g., using 90yttrium) will not become unnecessarily "concentrated" in any normal organ or tissue.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence in Table 7 below. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is directed to an isolated polynucleotide comprising a sequence shown in Table 6 below. The invention is further directed to an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence shown in Table 6 below. In another embodiment, the invention is directed to an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to an amino acid sequence in Table 7. The invention also encompasses an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence that encodes a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of any of the constructs in Table 7 with conservative amino acid substitutions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0130]	In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to an expression vector<br>
and/or a host cell which comprise one or more isolated polynucleotides of the present invention.<br>
(01311	Generally, any type of cultured cell line can be used to express the ABM of the<br>
present invention. In a preferred embodiment, HEK293-EBNA cells, CHO cells, BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63 mouse myeloma cells, PER cells,<br><br>
PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells, other mammalian cells, yeast cells, insect cells, or plant cells are used as the background cell line to generate the engineered host cells of the invention.<br>
The therapeutic efficacy of the ABMs of the present invention can be enhanced by producing them in a host cell that further expresses a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having GnTIII activity. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide having GnTIII activity is a fusion polypeptide comprising the Golgi localization domain of a Golgi resident polypeptide. In another preferred embodiment, the expression of the ABMs of the present invention in a host cell that expresses a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having GnTIII activity results in ABMs with increased Fc receptor binding affinity and increased effector function. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a host cell comprising (a) an isolated nucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a polypeptide having GnTIII activity, and (b) an isolated polynucleotide encoding an ABM of the present invention, such as a chimeric, primatized or humanized antibody that binds human EGFR. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide having GnTIII activity is a fusion polypeptide comprising the catalytic domain of GnTIQ and the Golgi localization domain is the localization domain of mannosidase n. Methods for generating such fusion polypeptides and using them to produce antibodies with increased effector functions are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. No. 60/495,142 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. 2004/0241817 al, the entire contents of each of which are expressly incoiporated herein by reference. In another preferred embodiment, the chimeric ABM is a chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof, having the binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the chimeric antibody comprises a human Fc. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is primatized or humanized.<br>
In one embodiment, one or several polynucleotides encoding an ABM of the present invention may be expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter or, altemately, a regulated expression system. Suitable regulated expression systems include, but are not limited to, a tetracycline-regulated expression system, an ecdysone-inducible expression system, a lac-switch expression system, a glucocorticoid-inducible expression system, a temperature-inducible promoter system, and a metallothlonein metal-inducible expression system.   If several different nucleic acids encoding an ABM of the present<br><br>
invention are comprised within the host cell system, some of them may be expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter, while others are expressed under the control of a regulated promoter. The maximal expression level is considered to be the highest possible level of stable polypeptide expression that does not have a significant adverse effect on cell growth rate, and will be determined using routine experimentation. Expression levels are determined by methods generally known in the art, including Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the ABM or an antibody specific for a peptide tag fused to the ABM; and Northern blot analysis. In a further alternative, the polynucleotide may be operatively linked to a reporter gene; the expression levels of a chimeric (e.g., humanized) ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody are determined by measuring a signal correlated with the expression level of the reporter gene. The reporter gene may be transcribed together with the nucleic acid(s) encoding said fusion polypeptide as a single mRNA molecule; their respective coding sequences may be linked either by an intemal ribosome entry site (IRES) or by a cap-independent translation enhancer (CITE). The reporter gene may be translated together with at least one nucleic acid encoding a chimeric (e.g., humanized) ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody such that a single polypeptide chain is formed. The nucleic acids encoding the AMBs of the present invention may be operatively linked to the reporter gene under the control of a single promoter, such that the nucleic acid encoding the fiision polypeptide and the reporter gene are transcribed into an RNA molecule which is alternatively spliced into two separate messenger KNA (mRNA) molecules; one of the resulting mRNAs is translated into said reporter protein, and the other is translated into said fiision polypeptide.<br>
Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequence of an ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody along with appropriate transcriptional/translational control signals. These methods include in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques and in vivo recombination/genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Maniatis ei al, Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y. (1989) and Ausubei et aly Chirrent Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y (1989).<br><br>
A variety of host-expression vector systems may be utilized to express the coding sequence of the ABMs of the present invention. Preferably, mammalian cells are used as host cell systems transfected with recombinant plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing the coding sequence of the protein of interest and the coding sequence of the fusion polypeptide. Most preferably, HEK293-EBNA cells, CHO cells, BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63 mouse myeloma cells, PER cells, PER.C6 cells or hybridoma cells, other mammalian cells, yeast cells, insect cells, or plant cells are used as host cell system. Some examples of expression systems and selection methods are described in the following references, and references therein: Borth et aly Biotechnol Bioen. 71(4):266-73 (2000-2001), in Werner et al, Arzneimittelforschung/Drug Res. 48(8):870-80 (1998), in Andersen and Krummen, Curr. Op. Biotechnol 13:117-123 (2002), in Chadd and Chamow, Curr. Op, Biotechnol 12:188-194 (2001), and in Giddmgs, Curr. Op. Biotechnol 12: 450-54 (2001). In alternate embodiments, other eukaryotic host cell systems may be used, including yeast cells transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the coding sequence of an ABM of the present invention, such as the expression systems taught in U.S, Pat. Appl. No. 60/344,169 and WO 03/056914 (methods for producing human-like glycoprotein in a non-human eukaryotic host cell) (the contents of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety); insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus) containing the coding sequence of a chimeric ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing the coding sequence of the ABM of the invention, including, but not limited to, the expression systems taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,815,184 (methods for expression and secretion of biologically active polypeptides from genetically engineered duckweed); WO 2004/057002 (production of glycosylated proteins in bryophyte plant cells by introduction of a glycosyl transferase gene) and WO 2004/024927 (methods of generating extracellular heterologous non-plant protein in moss protoplast); and U.S. Pat. Appl. Nos. 60/365,769, 60/368,047, and WO 2003/078614 (glycoprotein processing in transgenic plants comprising a functional mammalian GnTIII enzyme) (the contents of each of which are herein incorporated by reference in its<br><br>
entirety); or animal cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., adenovirus, vaccinia virus) including cell lines engineered to contain multiple copies of the DNA encoding a chimeric ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody either stably amplified (CHO/dhfir) or unstably amplified in double-minute chromosomes (e.g., murine cell lines). In one embodiment, the vector comprising the polynucleotide(s) encoding the ABM of the invention is polycistronic. also, in one embodiment the ABM discussed above is an antibody or a fragment thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the ABM is a humanized antibody.<br>
For the methods of this mvention, stable expression is generally preferred to transient expression because it typically achieves more reproducible results and also is more amenable to large-scale production. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication, host cells can be transformed with the respective coding nucleic acids controlled by appropriate expression control elements (e.g., promoter, enhancer, sequences, transcription terminators, polyadenylation sites, etc.), and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of foreign DNA, engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1-2 days in an enriched media, and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows selection of cells which have stably integrated the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines.<br>
A number of selection systems may be used, including, but not limited to, the herpes simplex virtis thymidine kinase (Wigler et al.y Cell 11:223 (1977)), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Szybalska &amp; Szybalski, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 48:2026 (1962)), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Lowy et ah. Cell 22:Zn (1980)) genes, which can be employed in tk-, hgprtt- or aprt- cells, respectively. also, antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for dhfr, which confers resistance to methotrexate (Wigler et ai, Natl. Acad. ScL USA 77:3567 (1989); Ollare et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 75:1527 (1981)); gpt, which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid (Mulligan &amp; Berg, Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 75:2072 (1981)); neo, which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G-418 (Colberre-Garapin et al, J. MoL Biol 750:1 (1981)); and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Santerre et al. Gene 50:147 (1984) genes.   Recently, additional selectable genes have been described.<br><br>
namely trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan; hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine (Hartman &amp; Mulligan, Proa Natl Acad, ScL USA 55:8047 (1988)); the glutamine synthase system; and ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) which confers resistance to the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, 2-(difluoromethyl)-DL-omithine, DFMO (McConlogue, in: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ed. (1987)).<br>
The present invention is further directed to a method for modifying the glycosylation profile of the ABMs of the present invention that are produced by a host cell, comprising expressing in said host cell a nucleic acid encoding an ABM of the invention and a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide with GnTlll activity, or a vector comprising such nucleic acids. Preferably, the modified polypeptide is IgG or a fragment thereof comprising the Fc region. In a particularly preferred embodiment the ABM is a humanized antibody or a firagment thereof<br>
The modified ABMs produced by the host cells of the invention exhibit increased Fc receptor binding affinity and/or increased effector function as a result of the modification. In a particularly preferred embodiment the ABM is a humanized antibody or a fragment thereof containing the Fc region. Preferably, the increased Fc receptor binding affinity is increased binding to a Fey activating receptor, such as the FcYRIIIa receptor. The increased effector function is preferably an increase in one or more of the following: increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, increased antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), increased cytokine secretion, increased immune-complex-mediated antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells, increased Fc-mediated cellular cytotoxicity, increased binding to NK cells, increased binding to macrophages, increased binding to polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), increased binding to monocytes, increased crosslinking of target-bound antibodies, increased direct signaling inducing apoptosis, increased dendritic cell maturation, and increased T cell priming.<br>

Generation Of Cell Lines For The Production Of Proteins With altered Glycosylation Pattern<br>
The present invention provides host cell expression systems for the generation of the ABMs of the present invention having modified glycosylation patterns. In particular, the present invention provides host cell systems for the generation of glycoforms of the ABMs of the present invention having an improved therapeutic value.   Therefore, the<br><br>
invention provides host cell expression systems selected or engineered to express a polypeptide having GnTIII activity. In one embodiment, the polypeptide having GnTIII activity is a fusion polypeptide comprising the Golgi localization domain of a heterologous Golgi resident polypeptide. Specifically, such host cell expression systems may be engineered to comprise a recombinant nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide having GnTIII, operatively linked to a constitutive or regulated promoter system.<br>
In one specific embodiment, the present invention provides a host cell that has been engineered to express at least one nucleic acid encoding a fusion polypeptide having GnTIII activity and comprising the Golgi localization domain of a heterologous Golgi resident polypeptide. In one aspect, the host cell is engineered with a nucleic acid molecule comprising at least one gene encoding a fusion polypeptide having GnTIII activity and comprising the Golgi localization domain of a heterologous Golgi resident polypeptide.<br>
Generally, any type of cultured cell line, including the cell lines discussed above, can be used as a background to engineer the host cell lines of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, HEK293-EBNA cells, CHO cells, BHK cells, NSO cells, SP2/0 cells, YO myeloma cells, P3X63 mouse myeloma cells, PER cells, PER,C6 cells or hybridoma cells, other mammalian cells, yeast cells, insect cells, or plant cells are used as the background cell line to generate the engineered host cells of the invention.<br>
The invention is contemplated to encompass any engineered host cells expressing a polypeptide having GnTIII activity, including a fusion polypeptide that comprises the Golgi localization domain of a heterologous Golgi resident polypeptide as defined herein.<br>
One or several nucleic acids encoding a polypeptide having GnTm activity may be expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter or, alternately, a regulated expression system. Such systems are well known in the art, and include the systems discussed above. If several different nucleic acids encoding fusion polypeptides having GnTIII activity and comprising the Golgi localization domain of a heterologous Golgi resident polypeptide are comprised within the host cell system, some of them may be expressed imder the control of a constitutive promoter, while others are expressed under the control of a regulated promoter. Expression levels of the fusion polypeptides having GnTIII activity are determined by methods generally known in the art, including Western<br><br>
blot analysis. Northern blot analysis, reporter gene expression analysis or measurement of GnTin activity. alternatively, a lectin may be employed which binds to biosynthetic products of the GnTlH, for example, E4-PHA lectin. alternatively, a functional assay which measures the increased Fc receptor binding or increased effector function mediated by antibodies produced by the cells engineered with the nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide with GnTIII activity may be used.<br>
Identification Of Transfectants Or Transformants That Express The Protein Having A Modified Glycosylation Pattern<br>
The host cells which contain the coding sequence of a chimeric (e.g., humanized) ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody and which express the biologically active gene products may be identified by at least four general approaches; (a) DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization; (b) the presence or absence of "marker" gene functions; (c) assessing the level of transcription as measured by the expression of the respective mRNA transcripts in the host cell; and (d) detection of the gene product as measured by immunoassay or by its biological activity.<br>
In the first approach, the presence of the coding sequence of a chimeric (e.g., humanized) ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody and the coding sequence of the polypeptide having GnTIII activity can be detected by DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybridization using probes comprising nucleotide sequences that are homologous to the respective coding sequences, respectively, or portions or derivatives thereof.<br>
In the second approach, the recombinant expression vector/host system can be identified and selected based upon the presence or absence of certain "marker" gene functions (e.g., thymidine kinase activity, resistance to antibiotics, resistance to methotrexate, transformation phenotype, occlusion body formation in baculovirus, etc.). For example, if the coding sequence of the ABM of the invention, or a Segment thereof, and the coding sequence of the polypeptide having GnTili activity are inserted within a marker gene sequence of the vector, recombinants containing the respective coding sequences can be identified by the absence of the marker gene function. alternatively, a marker gene can be placed in tandem with the coding sequences under the control of the same or different promoter used to control the expression of the coding sequences. Expression of the marker in response to induction or selection indicates expression of the<br><br>
coding sequence of the ABM of the invention and the coding sequence of the polypeptide having GnTIII activity.<br>
In the third approach, transcriptional activity for the coding region of the ABM of the invention, or a fragment thereof, and the coding sequence of the polypeptide having GnTin activity can be assessed by hybridization assays. For example, RNA can be isolated and analyzed by Northern blot using a probe homologous to the coding sequences of the ABM of the invention, or a fragment thereof, and the coding sequence of the polypeptide having GnTlU activity or particular portions thereof altematively, total nucleic acids of the host cell may be extracted and assayed for hybridization to such probes.<br>
In the fourth approach, the expression of the protein products can be assessed immunologically, for example by Western blots, immunoassays such as radioimmuno-precipitation, enzyme-linked immunoassays and the like. The ultimate test of the success of the expression system, however, involves the detection of the biologically active gene products.<br>
Generation And Use Of ABMs Having Increased Effector Function Including Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity<br>
In preferred embodiments, the present invention provides glycoforms of chimeric (e.g., humanized) ABMs having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody and having increased effector function including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Glycosylation engineering of antibodies has been previously described. See eg., U.S. Patent No. 6,602,684, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Clinical trials of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of some types of cancer have recently yielded encouraging results. Dillman, Cancer Biother. &amp; Radiopharm. 72:223-25 (1997); Deo et al. Immunology Today 75:127 (1997). A chimeric, unconjugated IgGl has been approved for low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Dilbnan, Cancer Biothen &amp; Radiopharm, 72:223-25 (1997), while another unconjugated mAb, a humanized IgGl targeting solid breast tumors, has also been showing promising results in phase HI clinical trials. Deo et al. Immunology Today J8:127 (1997). The antigens of these two mAbs are highly expressed in their respective tumor cells and the antibodies mediate potent tumor destruction by effector cells in vitro<br><br>
and in vivo. In contrast, many other unconjugated mAbs with fine tumor specificities cannot trigger effector functions of sufficient potency to be clinically usefiil Frost et al Cancer 80:317-33 (1997); Surfiis et ai, J, Immunother 7P:184-91 (1996). For some of these weaker mAbs, adjunct cytokine therapy is currently being tested. Addition of cytokines can stimulate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by increasing the activity and number of circulating lymphocytes. Frost et al, Cancer 80:317-33 (1997); Surfiis et al, J. Immunother, 79:184-91 (1996). ADCC, a lytic attack on antibody-targeted cells, is triggered upon binding of leukocyte receptors to the constant region (Fc) of antibodies. Deo et ai. Immunology Today 75:127 (1997).<br>
A different, but complementary, approach to increase ADCC activity of unconjugated IgGls is to engineer the Fc region of the antibody. Protein engineering studies have shown that FcyRs interact with the lower hinge region of the IgG CH2 domain. Lund et al, X ImmunoL 757:4963-69 (1996). However, FcyR binding also requires the presence of oligosaccharides covalently attached at the conserved Asn 297 in the CH2 region. Lund et al, J. ImmunoL 757:4963-69 (1996); Wright and 'Morrison, Trends Biotech. 75:26-31 (1997), suggesting that either oligosaccharide and polypeptide both directly contribute to the interaction site or that the oligosaccharide is required to maintain an active CH2 polypeptide conformation. Modification of the oligosaccharide structure can therefore be explored as a means to increase the affinity of the interaction.<br>
An IgG molecule carries two N-linked oligosaccharides in its Fc region, one on each heavy chain. As any glycoprotein, an antibody is produced as a population of glycoforms which share the same polypeptide backbone but have different oligosaccharides attached to the glycosylation sites. The oligosaccharides normally found in the Fc region of serum IgG are of complex bi-antennary type (Wormald et al, Biochemistry 35:130-38 (1997), with a low level of terminal sialic acid and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and a variable degree of terminal galactosylation and core fiicosylation. Some studies suggest that the minimal carbohydrate structure required for FqrR binding lies within the oligosaccharide core. Lund et al, J. ImmunoL 757:4963-69 (1996).<br>
The mouse- or hamster-derived cell lines used in industry and academia for production of unconjugated therapeutic mAbs normally attach the required oligosaccharide determinants to Fc sites.    IgGs expressed in these cell lines lack,<br><br>
however, the bisecting GlcNAc found in low amounts in serum IgGs. Lifely et al, Glycobiology 318:813-22 (1995). In contrast, it was recently observed that a rat myeloma-produced, humanized IgGl (CAMPATH-IH) carried a bisecting GlcNAc in some of its glycoforms. Lifely et al, Glycobiology 575:813-22 (1995). The rat cell-derived antibody reached a similar maximal in vitro ADCC activity as CAMPATH-IH antibodies produced in standard cell lines, but at significantly lower antibody concentrations.<br>
The CAMPATH antigen is normally present at high levels on lymphoma cells, and this chimeric mAb has high ADCC activity in the absence of a bisecting GlcNAc. Lifely et al, Glycobiology 5/5:813-22 (1995). In the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a bisecting GlcNAc is added by GnTIII. Schachter, Biochem. Cell Biol 64:163-81 (1986).<br>
Previous studies used a single antibody-producing CHO cell line, that was previously engineered to express, in an externally-regulated fashion, different levels of a cloned GnT III gene enzyme (Umana, P., et ai, Nature Biotechnol. 77:176-180 (1999)). This approach established for the first time a rigorous correlation between expression of GrnTin and the ADCC activity of the modified antibody. Thus, the invention contemplates a recombmant, chimeric antibody or a fragment thereof with the binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody, having altered glycosylation resulting fi:om increased GnTin activity. The increased GnTIII activity results in an increase in the percentage of bisected oligosaccharides, as well as a decrease in the percentage of fucose residues, in the Fc region of the ABM. This antibody, or fi*agment thereof, has increased Fc receptor binding affinity and increased effector function. In addition, the invention is directed to antibody fi:agment and fusion proteins comprising a region that is equivalent to the Fc region of immunoglobulins. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is humanized.<br>
Therapeutic Applications of ABMs Produced According to the Methods of the Invention.<br>
In the broadest sense, the ABMs of the present invention can be used target cells in vivo or in vitro that express EGFR. The cells expressing EGFR can be targetted for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. In one aspect, the ABMs of the present invention can be used to detect the presence ofEGFR in a sample. In another aspect, the ABMs of the present invention can be used to inhibit or reduce EGFR-mediated signal transduction in cells  expressing  EGFR  on the  surface.     EGFR  is  abnormally expressed  (e.g.,<br><br>
overexpressed) in many human tumors compared to non-tumor tissue of the same cell type. Thus, the ABMs of the invention are particularly useful in the prevention of tumor formation, eradication of tumors and inhibition of tumor growth. By blocking the binding of EGFR ligands to EGFR, the ABMs of the invention inhibit EGF-dependent tumor cell activation, including EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, increased extracellular acidification rate, and cell proliferation. The ABMs of the invention also act to arrest the cell cycle, cause apoptosis of the target cells (e.g., tumor cells), and inhibit angiogenesis and/or differentiation of target cells. The ABMs of the invention can be used to treat any tumor expressing EGFR. Particular malignancies that can be treated with the ABMs of the invention include, but are not limited to, epidermal and squamous cell carcinomas, non-small cell lung carcinomas, gliomas, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, and renal cell carcinomas.<br>
The ABMs of the present can be used alone to target and kill tumor cells in vivo. The ABMs can also be used in conjunction with an appropriate therapeutic agent to treat human carcinoma. For example, the ABMs can be used in combination with standard or conventional treatment methods such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy or can be conjugated or linked to a therapeutic drug, or toxin, as well as to a lymphokine or a tumor-inhibitory growth factor, for delivery of the therapeutic agent to the site of the carcinoma. The conjugates of the ABMs of this invention that are of prime importance are (1) immunotoxins (conjugates of the ABM and a cytotoxic moiety) and (2) labeled (e.g. radiolabeled, enzyme-labeled, or flnorochrome-labeled) ABMs in which the label provides a means for identifying immune complexes that include the labeled ABM. The ABMs can also be used to induce lysis through the natural complement process, and to interact with antibody dependent cytotoxic cells normally present<br>
The cytotoxic moiety of the immunotoxin may be a cytotoxic drug or an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial or plant origin, or an enzymatically active fragment ("A chain") of such a toxin. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof used are diphtheria A chain, nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin, exotoxin A chain (from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), ricin A cham, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, aleurites fordii proteins, dianthin proteins, Phytolacca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin, sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin. In<br><br>
another embodiment, the ABMs are conjugated to small molecule anticancer drugs. Conjugates of the ABM and such cytotoxic moieties are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents. Examples of such reagents are SPDP, IT, bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such a dimethyl adipimidate HCl, active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate, aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, bis-azido compounds such as bis (p-azidobenzoyl) hexanediamine, bis-diazonium derivatives such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyI)-ethyIenediamine, diisocyanates such as tolylene 2,6-diisocyanate, and bis-active fluorine compounds such as l,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitroben2ene. The lysing portion of a toxin may be joined to the Fab fragment of the ABMs. Additional impropriate toxins are known in the art, as evidenced in e.g., published U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0128448, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
hi one embodiment, a chimeric (e.g., humanized), glycoengineered ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody, is conjugated to ricin A chain. Most advantageously, the ricin A chain is deglycosylated and produced through recombinant means. An advantageous method of making the ricin immunotoxin is described in Vitetta et al.. Science 238,1098 (1987), hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
When used to kill human cancer cells in vitro for diagnostic purposes, the conjugates will typically be added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of at least about 10 nM. The fomiulation and mode of administration for in vitro use are not critical. Aqueous formulations that are compatible with the culture or perfixsion medium will normally be used. Cytotoxicity may be read by conventional techniques to determine the presence or degree of cancer.<br>
As discussed above, a cytotoxic radiopharmaceutical for treating cancer may be made by conjugating a radioactive isotope (e.g., I, Y, Pr) to a chimeric, glycoengineered ABM having substantially the same binding specificity of the rat ICR62 antibody. The term "cytotoxic moiety*' as used herein is intended to include such isotopes.<br>
In another embodiment, liposomes are filled with a cytotoxic drug and the liposomes are coated with the ABMs of the present invention. Because there are many EGFR molecules on the surface of the EGFR-expressing malignant cell, this method permits delivery of large amounts of drug to the correct cell type.<br>
Techniques for conjugating such therapeutic agents to antibodies are well known (see, e.g., Amon et al, "Monoclonal Antibodies for Immunotargeting of Drugs in Cancer<br><br>
Therapy", in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al (eds.), pp. 243-56 (alan R. Liss. Inc. 1985); Hellstrom et al, "Antibodies For Drug Delivery", in Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, "Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review", in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera Bt al. (eds,), pp. 475-506 (1985); and Thorpe et al, "The Preparation And Cytotoxic Properties Of Antibody-Toxin Conjugates", Immunol, Rev., 62:119-58 (1982)).<br>
Still other therapeutic applications for the ABMs of the invention include conjugation or linkage, e.g., by recombinant DNA techniques, to an enzyme capable of converting a prodrug into a cytotoxic drug and the use of that antibody-enzyme conjugate in combination with the prodrug to convert the prodrug to a cytotoxic agent at the tumor site (see, e,g., Senter et al., "Anti-Tumor Effects of Antibody-alkaline Phosphatase", Proc. Natl Acad, Set USA 55:4842-46 (1988); "Enhancement of the in vitro and in vivo Antitumor Activites of Phosphorylated Mitocycin C and Etoposide Derivatives by Monoclonal Antibody-alkaline Phosphatase Conjugates", Cancer Research 49:5789-5792 (1989); and Senter, "Activation of Prodrugs by Antibody-Enzyme Conjugates: A New Approach to Cancer Therapy," FASEB J. :188-193 (1990)).<br>
Still another therapeutic use for the ABMs of the invention involves use, either unconjugated, in the presence of complement, or as part of an antibody-drug or antibody-toxin conjugate, to remove tumor cells from the bone marrow of cancer patients. According to this approach, autologous bone marrow may be purged ex vivo by treatment with the antibody and the marrow infused back into the patient [see, e.g., Ramsay et al,, "Bone Marrow Purging Using Monoclonal Antibodies", J. Clin. Immunol., 8(2):81-88 (1988)].<br>
Furthermore, it is contemplated that the invention comprises a single-chain immunotoxin comprising antigen binding domains that allow substantially the same specificity of binding as the rat ICR62 antibody (e.g., polypeptides comprising the CDRs of the rat ICR62 antibody) and further comprising a toxin polypeptide. The single-chain immimotoxins of the invention may be used to treat human carcinoma in vivo.<br>
Similarly, a fusion protein comprising at least the antigen-binding region of an ABM of the invention joined to at least a functionally active portion of a second protein<br><br>
laving anti-tumor acitivty, e.g., a lymphokine or oncostatin, can be used to treat human carcinoma in vivo.<br>
The present invention provides a method for selectively killing tumor cells expressing EGFR. This method comprises reacting the immunoconjugate (e.g., the immunotoxin) of the invention with said tumor cells. These tumor cells may be from a human carcinoma.<br>
Additionally, this invention provides a method of treating carcinomas (for example, human carcinomas) in vivo. This method comprises administering to a subject a phaimaceuticaUy effective amount of a composition containing at least one of the immunoconjugates (e.g., the immunotoxin) of the invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention is directed to an improved method for treating cell proliferation disorders wherem EGFR is expressed, particularly wherein EGFR is. abnormally expressed (e.g. overexpressed), including cancers of the bladder, brain^ head and neck, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, skin, and kidney, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an ABM of the present invention to a human subject in need thereof In a preferred embodiment, the ABM is a glycoengineered anti-EGFR antibody with a binding specificity substantially the same as that of the rat ICR62 antibody. In another preferred embodiment the antibody is humanized. Examples of cell proliferation disorders that can be treated by an ABM of the present invention include, but are not limited to neoplasms located in the: abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous system (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic region, and urogenital system.<br>
Similarly, other cell proliferation disorders can also be treated by the ABMs of the present invention. Examples of such cell proliferation disorders include, but are not limited to: hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative disorders, paraproteinemias, purpxu:a, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron's Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher's Disease, histiocytosis, and any other cell proliferation disease, besides neoplasia, located in an organ system listed above.<br><br>
In accordance with the practice of this invention, the subject may be a human, equine, porcine, bovine, murine, canine, feline, and avian subjects. Other warm blooded animals are also included in this invention.<br>
The subject invention further provides methods for inhibiting the growth of human tumor cells, treating a tumor in a subject, and treating a proliferative type disease in a subject. These methods comprise administering to the subject an effective amount of the composition of the invention.<br>
The invention is further directed to methods for treating non-malignant diseases or<br>
disorders in a mammal characterized by abnormal activation or production of EGFR or<br>
one or more EGFR ligands, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of the ABMs of the invention.	The subject will generally have<br>
EGFR-expressing cells, for instance in diseased tissue thereof, such that the ABMs of the invention are able to bind to cells within the subject.<br>
Abnormal activation or expression of EGFR or an EGFR ligand may be occurring in cells of the subject, e.g. in diseased tissue of the subject. Abnormal activation of EGFR may be attributable to amplification, overexpression or aberrant production of the EGFR and/or EGFR ligand In one embodiment of the invention, a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether abnormal production or activation of EGFR (or EGFR ligand) is occuring the subject. For example, gene amplification and/or overexpression of EGFR and/or ligand may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplification/overexpression are available in the art and include the IHC, FISH and shed antigen assays described above. alternatively, or additionally, levels of an EGFR ligand, such as TGF-a in or associated with the sample may be determined according to known procedures. Such assays may detect protein and/or nucleic acid encoding it in the sample to be tested. In one embodiment, EGFR ligand levels in a sample may be determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC); see, for example, Scher et al Clin. Cancer Research 7:545-550 (1995). alternatively, or additionally, one may evaluate levels of EGFR -encoding nucleic acid in the sample to be tested; e.g. via FISH, southern blotting, or PCR techniques.<br>
Moreover, EGFR or EGFR Hgand overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay, e.g. by administering a molecule (such as an antibody) which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label<br><br>
(e.g. a radioactive isotope) and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.<br>
alternatively, one may detect EGFR heterodimers, especially EGFR-ErbB2, EGFR -ErbB3 or EGFR -ErbB4 heterodimers, in the patient, e.g. in diseased tissue thereof, prior to therapy. Various methods to detect noncovalent protein-protein interactions or otherwise indicate proximity between proteins of interest are available. Exemplary methods for detecting EGFR heterodimers include, without limitation, immunoaffinity-based methods, such as immunoprecipitation; fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Selvin, Nat.

It is apparent, therefore, that the present invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions, combinations and methods for treating human malignancies such as cancers of the bladder, brain, head and neck, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon, prostate, skin, and kidney. For example, the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment of human malignancies comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an antibody of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The ABM compositions of the invention can be administered using conventional modes of admmistration including, but not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, oral, intralymphatic or administration directly into the tumor. Intravenous administration is preferred.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, therapeutic formulations contaimng the ABMs of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the<br><br>
form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEENTM, PLURONICSTM or polyethylene glycol (PEG).<br>
The ABMs of the present invention may be administered to a subject to treat a disease or disorder characterized by abnormal EGFR or EGFR ligand activity, such as a tumor, either alone or in combination therapy with, for example, a chemotherapeutic agent and/or radiation therapy. Exemplary anti-EGFR antibody formulations are described in Herbst and Shen, Cancer 94(5):1593-1611. Suitable chemotherapeutic agents include cisplatin, doxorubicin, topotecan, paclitaxel, vinblastine, carboplatin, and etoposide.<br>
Lyophilized formulations adapted for subcutaneous administration are described in WO97/04801. Such lyophihized formulations may be reconstituted with a suitable diluent to a high protein concentration and the reconstituted formulation may be administered subcutaneously to the mammal to be treated herein.<br>
The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide a cytotoxic agent, chemotherapeutic agent, cytokine or immunosuppressive agent (e.g. one which acts on T cells, such as cyclosporin or an antibody that binds T cells, e.g., one which binds LFA-1). The effective amount of such<br><br>
other agents depends on the amount of antagonist present in the formulation, the type of disease or disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages.<br>
The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albimiin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed, (1980).<br>
Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antagonist, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and yethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOTTM (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.<br>
The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in a variety of dosage forms which include, but are not limited to, liquid solutions or suspension, tablets, pills, powders, suppositories, polymeric microcapsules or microvesicles, liposomes, and injectable or infusible solutions. The preferred form depends upon the mode of administration and the therapeutic application.<br>
The compositions of the invention also preferably include conventional pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carriers and adjuvants known in the art such as human serum albumin, ion exchangers, alumina, lecithin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, and salts or electrolytes such as protamine sulfate.<br><br>
The most effective mode of administration and dosage regimen for the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention depends upon the severity and course of the disease, the patient's health and response to treatment and the judgment of the treating physician. Accordingly, the dosages of the compositions should be titrated to the individual patient. Nevertheless, an effective dose of the compositions of this invention will generally be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 2000 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the effective dose is in the range of from about 1.0 mg/kg to about 15.0 mg/kg. In a more specific embodiment, the dose is in the range of from about l.S mg/kg to about 12 mg/kg. In other embodiments, the dose is in the range of from about 1.S mg/kg to about 4.5 mg/kg, or from about 4.5 mg/kg to about 12 mg/kg. The dose of the present invention may also be any dose within these ranges, including, but not limited to, 1.0 mg/kg, L5 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3-0 mg/kg, 3.5 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, 4.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 5.5 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg, 6.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/kg, 8.5 mg/kg, 9.0 mg/kg, 9.5 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, 10.5 mg/kg, ILO mg/kg, 11.5 mg/kg, 12,0 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, 13.0 mg/kg, 13.5 mg/kg, 14.0 mg/kg, 14.5 mg/kg, or 15.0 mg/kg.<br>
The molecules described herein may be in a variety of dosage forms which include, but are not limited to, liquid solutions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, suppositories, polymeric microcapsules or microvesicles, liposomes, and injectable or invisible solutions. The preferred form depends upon the mode of administration and the therapeutic application.<br>
The dosages of the present invention may, in some cases, be determined by the use of predictive biomarkers. Predictive biomarkers are molecular markers that are used to determine (i.e., observe and/or quanitate) a pattern of expression and/or activation of tumor related genes or proteins, or cellular components of a tumor related signalling pathway. Elucidating the biological effects of targeted-therapies in tumor tissue and correlating these effects with clinical response helps identify the predominant growth and survival pathways operative in tumors, thereby establishing a profile of likely responders and conversely providing a rational for designing strategies to overcoming resistance. For example, biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy may comprise molecules that are in the EGFR downstream signalling pathway that leads to a cell proliferation disorder including, but not limited to, Akt, RAS, RAF, MAPK, ERKl, ERK2, PKC, STAT3, STATS (Mitchell, Nature Biotech, 22: 363-364 (2004); Becker, Nature Biotech 22:15-18 (2004);<br><br>
Tsao and Herbst, Signal 4:4-9 (2003)). Biomarkers for anti-EGFR therapy may also comprise growth factor receptors such as EGFR, ErbB-2 (HER2/neu), and ErbB-3 (HER3), and may be positive or negative predictors of patient response to anti-EGFR therapy. For example, the growth factor receptor ErbB-3 (HER3) was determined to be a negative predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR antibody ABX-EGF (U.S. Pat, Appl. Pub. No. 2004/0132097 al).<br>
Predictive biomarkers may be measured by cellular assays that are well known in the art including, but not limited to immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, capture-and-detection assays, and reversed phase assays, and/or assays set forth in U.S. Pat. Appl, Pub. No. 2004/0132097 al, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference . Predictive biomarkers of anti-EGFR theerapy, themselves, can be identified according to the techniques set forth in U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2003/0190689A1, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides for a method for treating an EGFR-related disorder comprising predicting a response to anti-EGFR therapy in a human subject in need of treatment by assaying a sample from the human subject prior to therapy with one or a plurality of reagents that detect expression and/or activiation of predictive biomarkers for an EGFR-related disorder such as cancer, determining a pattern of expression and/opr activation of one or more of the predictive biomarkers, wherein the pattern predicts the human subject's response to the anti-EGFR therapy; and administering to a human subject who is predicted to respond positively to anti-EGFR treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising an ABM of the present invention. As used herein, a human subject who is predicted to respond positively to anti-EGFR treatment is one for whom anti-EGFR will have a measurable effect on the EGFR-related disorder (e.g., tumor regression/shrinkage) and for whom the benefits of anti-EGFR therapy are not outweighed by adverse effects (e.g., toxicity). As used herein, a sample means any biological sample from an organism, particularly a human, comprising one or more cells, including single cells of any origin, tissue or biopsy samples which has been removed from organs such as breast, lung, gastrointestinal tract, skin, cervix, ovary, prostate, kidney, brain, head and neck ,or any other other organ or<br><br>
tissue of the body, and other body samples including, but not limited to, smears, sputum, secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, blood, lymph fluid, urine and feces.<br>
The composition comprising an ABM of the present invention will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disease or disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinic condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disease or disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The therapeutically effective amount of the antagonist to be administered will be governed by such considerations.<br>
As a general proposition, the therapeutically effective amount of the antibody administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of antagonist used being in the range of about 2 to 10 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount is in the range of from about 1.0 mg/kg to about 15.0 mg/kg. In a more specific embodiment, the dose is in the range of from about l.S mg/kg to about 12 mg/kg. In other embodiments, the dose is in the range of from about l.S mg/kg to about 4.S mg/kg, or from about 4.S mg/kg to about 12 mg/kg. The dose of the present invention may also be any dose within these ranges, including, but not limited to, 1.0 mg/kg, l.S mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, 3.5 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, 4,5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 5.5 mg/kg, 6.0 mg/kg, 6.5 mg/kg, 7.0 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 8.0 mg/kg, 8.5 mg/kg, 9.0 mg/kg, 9,5 mg/kg, 10.0 mg/kg, 10.5 mg/kg, 11.0 mg/kg, 11.5 mg/kg, 12.0 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, 13.0 mg/kg, 13.5 mg/kg, 14.0 mg/kg, 14.5 mg/kg, or 15.0 mg/kg.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ABM is an antibody, preferably a humanized antibody. Suitable dosages for such an unconjugated antibody are, for example, in the range from about 20 mg/m2 to about 1000 mg/m2. For example, one may administer to the patient one or more doses of substantially less than 375 mg/m2 of the antibody, e.g., where the dose is in the range from about 20 mg/m2 to about 250 mg/m2, for example from about 50 mg/m2 to about 200 mg/m2.<br>
Moreover, one may administer one or more initial dose(s) of the antibody followed by one or more subsequent dose(s), wherein the mg/m dose of the antibody in the subsequent dose(s) exceeds the mg/m2 dose of the antibody in the initial dose(s). For<br><br>
example, the initial dose may be in the range from about 20 mg/m  to about 250 mg/m (e.g., from about 50 mg/m  to about 200mg/m ) and the subsequent dose may be in the range from about 250 mg/m2 to about 1000 mg/ml<br>
As noted above, however, these suggested amounts of ABM are subject to a great deal of therapeutic discretion. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose and scheduling is the result obtained, as indicated above. For example, relatively higher doses may be needed initially for the treatment of ongoing and acute diseases. To obtain the most efficacious results, depending on the disease or disorder, the antagonist is administered as close to the first sign, diagnosis, appearance, or occurrence of the disease or disorder as possible or during remissions of the disease or disorder.<br>
In the case of anti-EGFR antibodies used to treat tumors, optimum therapeutic results have generally been achieved with a dose that is sufficient to completely saturate the EGF receptors on the target cells. The dose necessary to achieve saturation will depend on the number of EGF receptors expressed per tumor cell (which can vary significantly between different tumor types). Serum concentrations as low as 30 nM have been effective in treating some tumors, while concentrations above 100 nM may be necessary to achieve optimum therapeutic effect with other tumors. The dose necessary to achieve saturation for a given tumor can be readily determined in vitro by radioimmunoassay or immunoprecipiation.<br>
In general, for combination therapy with radiation, one suitable therapeutic regimen involves eight weekly infusions of an anti-EGFR ABM of the invention at a loading dose of 100-500 mg/m2 followed by maintenance doses at 100-250 mg/m2 and radiation in the amount of 70.0 Gy at a dose of 2.0 Gy daily. For combination therapy with .chemotherq)y, one suitable therapeutic regimen mvolves admmistering an anti-EGFR ABM of the invention as loading/maintenance doses weekly of 100/100 mg/m\ 400/250 mg/m2, or 500/250 mg/m2 in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 every three weeks. alternatively, gemcitabine or irinotecan can be used in place of cisplatin.<br>
The ABM of the present invention is administered by any suitable means, including parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapuhnonary, and intranasal, and, if desired for local immunosuppressive treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions    include    intramuscular,    intravenous,    intraarterial,    intraperitoneal,    or<br><br>
subcutaneous administration. In addition, the antagonist may suitably be administered by pulse infusion, e.g., with declining doses of the antagonist. Preferably the dosing is given by injections, most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections, depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.<br>
One may administer other compounds, such as cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents, immimosuppressive agents and/or cytokines with the antagonists herein. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.<br>
It would be clear that the dose of the composition of the invention required to achieve cures may be further  reduced with schedule optimization.<br>

Further, the lipid carrier may be a fatty acid. also, (he lipid carrier may be a detergent. As used herein, a detergent is any substance that alters the surface tension of a liquid, generally lowering it.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Unless otherwise specified, references to the numbering of specific amino acid residue positions in the following Examples are according to the Kabat numbering system. Unless otherwise noted, the materials and methods used to make the antibodies described in these working examples are in accordance with those set forth in the examples of U.S. Patent Appl. No. 10/981,738, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
High Homology Acceptor Approach<br>
The high homology antibody acceptor framework search was performed by aligning the rat ICR62 protein sequence to a collection of human germ-line sequences and choosing that human sequence that showed the highest sequence identity, while conserving all canonical residues on a functional level. Here, the sequence 1-e from the VHl family within the VBase database was chosen as the heavy chain framework acceptor sequence, and the A30 sequence from the VKl family of the VBase database was chosen to be the framework acceptor for the light chain. On these two acceptor frameworks the three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and/or specificity-determining residues of those CDRs of the rat ICR62 heavy and light variable domains were grafted. Since the framework 4 region is not part of the variable region of the germ line gene, the alignment for that position was performed individually. The JH6 region was chosen for the heavy chain, and the JK2 region was chosen for the light chain. Molecular modelling of the designed immunoglobulin domain revealed one position outside of the Kabat CDRl potentially requiring the murine amino acid residues instead of the human ones outside of the CDR. Reintroduction of murine amino acid residues into the human framework would generate so-called "back mutations." For example, the human acceptor amino acid residue at Kabat position 27 (Glycine in 1-e) was back mutated to a tyrosine residue. To show the importance of the residues for antigen binding, humanized antibody variants were designed that either included or omitted the back mutations. The humanized antibody light chain did not require any back mutations. After designing the protein sequences, DNA sequences encoding these proteins were synthesized as detailed below.<br>
Mixed Framework Approach<br>
To avoid the need for introducing back mutations at critical positions (critical to retain good antigen binding affinity or antibody functions) of the human acceptor framework, it was investigated whether framework region 1 (FRl), framework regions 1 (FRl) and 2 (FR2) together, or framework region 3 (FR3) of a functionally humanized antibody could be replaced by human antibody sequences already having donor residues,<br><br>
or amino acid residues that are functionally equivalent to donor residues, at important residue positions in the natural human germline sequence. For this purpose, the VH frameworks 1, 2 and 3 of the rat ICR62 VH sequence were aligned individually to human germ-line sequences. Here, highest sequence identity was not used for choosing acceptor frameworks; instead matching of several critical residues was performed. Those critical residues comprise the so-called canonical residues, and also those residues at position 27, 28, and 30 (Kabat numbering), which lie outside of the CDRl definition by Kabat, but often are involved in antigen binding. In addition, critical residues are those that show important interaction with the G3Rs, as can be determined using molecular modelling. The IMGT sequrace IGHVl-58 (Accession No. M29809), IGHV5-51 (Accession No. M99686), as well as the VBase sequence 1-02 from the VHl family were chosen as suitable ones for replacing either FRl, 2, or 3. In brief: IGHVl-58 showed a promising pattern in the Kabat positions 27 to 30, but does not fulfill the criteria for the canonical position 71. The IGHV5-51 has a matching residue 71, so its FR3 could be used. also its FRl is close to the desired FRl sequence.<br>
The 1-e of VHl fulfilled all criteria apart from position 27. Sequence 1-02 was considered acceptable for the FRl and FR2 regions, but would require a back mutation in FR3,<br>
After designing the protein sequences, DNA sequences encoding these proteins were synthesized as detailed below. Using this approach back mutations were not necessary in most of the constructs of the heavy chain, in order to retain good levels of antigen binding. The chronology and the reasoning of the mixed framework constructs is explained in the results section.<br>
Synthesis of the antibody genes<br>
After having designed the amino acid sequence of the humanized antibody V region, the DNA sequence was generated. The DNA sequence data of the individual frame work regions was foimd in the databases (e.g. IMGT or VBase) for human germ Hne sequences. The DNA sequence infomiation of the CDR regions was taken from the published sequence of the rat ICR62 antibody {see, e.g„ PCT Publication WO 95/20045). With these sequences, the whole DNA sequence was virtually assembled. Having this DNA sequence data, diagnostic restriction sites were introduced in the virtual sequence by introducing silent mutations, creating recognition sites for restriction endonucleases.<br><br>
To obtain the physical DNA chain, gene synthesis was performed (see, e.g., Wheeler et al 1995). In this method, oligonucleotides are designed from the genes of interest, such, that a series of oligonucleotides is derived from the coding strand, and one other series is from the non-coding strand. The 3' and 5' ends of each oligonucleotide (except the very first and last in the row) always show complementary sequences to two primers derived from the opposite strand. When putting these oligonucleotides into a reaction bufTer suitable for any heat stable polymerase, and adding Mg2+, dNTPs and a DNA polymerase, each oligonucleotide is extended from its 3' end. The newly formed 3' end of one primer then anneals with the next primer of the opposite strand, and extending its sequence further under conditions suitable for template dependant DNA cham elongation. The final product was cloned into a conventional vector for propagation in e. coli.<br>

For construction of the chimeric (i.e., frilly rat V region and human C region) and humanized anti-EGFR light and heavy chain chain expression vectors, human heavy and light chain leader sequences (for secretion) were added upstream of the variable region DNA sequences. Downstream of the variable regions, the constant regions of IgGl for the heavy chain were added, and the kappa constant region for the light chain using standard molecular biology techniques. The resulting frill antibody heavy and light chain DNA sequences were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors (one for the light chain and one for the heavy chain) under the control of the MPSV promoter and upstream of a synthetic polyA site, each vector carrying an EBV OriP sequence.<br>
Antibodies were produced by co-transfecting HEK293-EBNA cells with the mammalian antibody heavy and light chain expression vectors using a calcium phosphate-transfection approach. Exponentially growing HEK293-EBNA cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. For the production of unmodified antibody, the cells were transfected only with antibody heavy and light chain expression vectors in a 1:1 ratio. For the production of the glycoengineered antibody, the cells were co-transfected with four plasmids, two for antibody expression, one for a frision GnTIII polypeptide expression, and one for mannosidase 11 expression at a ratio of 4:4:1:1, respectively. Cells were grown as adherent monolayer cultures in T flasks using DMEM culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS, and were transfected when they were between 50 and 80% confluent.  For the transfection of a T75 flask, 8 million cells were<br><br>
seeded 24 hours before transfection in 14 ml DMEM culture medium supplemented with FCS (at 10% VA^ fmal), 250 ng/ml neomycin, and cells were placed at 'iTC in an incubator with a 5% C02 atmosphere overnight. For each T75 flask to be transfected, a solution of DNA, CaC12 and water was prepared by mixing 47 ng total plasmid vector DNA divided equally between the Ught and heavy chain expression vectors, 235 fil of a IM CaC12 solution, and adding water to a final volume of 46? (il. To this solution, 469 ^1 of a SOmM HEPES, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HP04 solution at pH 7.05 were added, mixed immediately for 10 sec and left to stand at room temperature for 20 sec. The suspension was diluted with 12 ml of Dm2l supplemented with 2% FCS, and added to the T75 in place of the existing medium. The cells were incubated at 37^C, 5% C02 for about 17 to 20 hours, then medium was replaced with 12 ml DMEM, 10% FCS, The conditioned culture medium was harvested 5 to 7 days post-transfection centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm, followed by a second centrifiigation for 10 min at 4000 rpm and kept at 4X.<br>
The secreted antibodies were purified by Protein A af&amp;nity chromatography, followed by cation exchange chromatography and a final size exclusion chromatographic step on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia) exchanging the buffer to phosphate buffer saline and collecting the pure monomeric IgGl antibodies. Antibody concentration was estimated using a spectrophotometer from the absoibance at 280 nm. The antibodies were formulated in a 25 mM potassium phosphate, 125 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM glycine solution of pH 6.7.<br>
Glycoengineered variants of the humanized antibody were produced by co-transfection of the antibody expression vectors together with a GnT-IU glycosyltransferase expression vector, or together with a GnT-UI expression vector plus a Golgi mannosidase n expression vector. Glycoengineered antibodies were purified and formulated as described above for the non-glycoragineered antibodies. The oligosaccharides attached to the Fc region of the antibodies were analysed by MalDI/TOF-MS as described below.<br>
Oligosaccharide Analysis<br>
Oligosaccharides were enzymatically released firom the antibodies by PNGaseP digestion, with the antibodies being either immobilized on a PVDF membrane or in solution.<br><br>
The resulting digest solution containing the released oligosaccharides either prepared directly for MalDI/TOF-MS analysis or was further digested with EndoH glycosidase prior to sample preparation for MalDI/TOF-MS analysis.<br>
Oligosaccharide release method for PVDF membrane-inunobilized antibodies<br>
The wells of a 96-well plate made with a PVDF (Inunobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts) membrane were wetted with 100 \xl methanol and the liquid was drawn through the PVDF membrane using vacuum applied to ttie Multiscreen vacuum manifold (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts). The PVDF m2nbranes were washed three times with 300 ul of water. The wells were then washed with 50 \xl RCM buffer (8M Urea, 360mM Tris, 3.2mM EDTA, pH 8.6). Between 30-40 ng antibody was loaded in a well containing 10 jil RCM bxiffer. The liquid in the well was drawn through the membrane by applying vacuum, and the membrane was subsequently washed twice with 50 fil RCM buffer. The reduction of disulfide bridges was performed by addition of 50 ^1 of O.IM dithiothreitol in RCM and incubation at 37**C for 1 h.<br>
Following reduction, a vacuum was appUed to remove the dithiothreitol solution Scom the well. The wells were washed three times with 300 ^1 water before performing the carboxymethylation of the cysteine residues by addition of 50 ^1 O.IM iodoacetic acid in RCM buffer and incubation at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.<br>
After carboxymethylation, the wells were drawn with vacuum and subsequently washed three times with 300 ^l water. The PVDF membrane was then blocked, to prevent adsoiption of the endoglycosidase, by incubating 100 ^1 of a 1% aqueous solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone 360 at room temperature for 1 hour. The blocking reagent was then removed by gentle vacuum followed by three washes with 300 p,l water.<br>
N-linked oligosaccharides were released by addition of 2.5 mU peptide-N-glycosydase F (recombinat N-GIycanase, GLYKO, Novato, CA) and 0.1 mU Sialidase (GLYKO, Novato, CA), to remove any potential charged monosaccharide residues, in a final volume of 25 fil in 20mM NaHCOa, pH7.0). Digestion was performed for 3 hours at 37°C.<br><br>
Oligosaccharide release method for antibodies in solution<br>
Between 40 and 50 ^g of antibody were mixed with 2.5 mU of PNGaseF (Glyko, U.S.A.) in 2 mM Tris, pH7.0 in a fmal volume of 25 microliters, and the mix was incubated for 3 hours at 37®C.<br>
Use of Endoglycosidase H digestion of PNGaseF-released oligosaccharides for the assignment of hybrid bisected oUgosaccharide structures to MalDFTOF-MS neutral oHgosaccharide peaks<br>
The PNGaseF released oligosaccharides were subsequently digested with Endoglycosidase H (EC 3.2.1.96). For the EndoH digestion, 15 mU of EndoH (Roche, Switzerland) were added to the PNGaseF digest (antibody in solution method above) to give a final volume of 30 microliters, and the mix was incubated for 3 hours at 37^C. EndoH cleaves between the N-acetylglucosamine residues of the chitobiose core of N-linked oUgosaccharides. The enzyme can only digest oUgomannose and most hybrid type glycans, whereas complex type oligosaccharides are not hydrolyzed.<br>
Sample preparation for MalDI/TOF-MS<br>
The enzymatic digests containing the released oUgosaccharides were incubated for a further 3 h at room after the addition of acetic acid to a final concentration of 150 mM, and were subsequenUy passed through 0.6 ml of cation exchange resin (AG50W-X8 resin, hydrogen form, 100-200 mesh, BioRad, Switzerland) packed into a micro-bio-spin chromatognq)hy colunm (BioRad, Switzerland) to remove cations and proteins. One microliter of the resulting sample was applied to a stainless steel target plate, and mixed on the plate with 1 ^1 of sDHB matrix. sDHB matrix was prepared by dissolving 2 mg of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid plus 0.1 mg of 5-methoxysalicylic acid in 1 ml of ethanol/10 mM aqueous sodium chloride 1:1 (v/v). The samples were air dried, 0.2 \i\ ethanol was applied, and the samples were finally allowed to re-crystallize under air.<br>
MalDiyrOF-MS<br>
I	The MalDI-TOF mass spectrometer used to acquire the mass spectra was a<br>
Voyager Elite (Perspective Biosystems). The instrument was operated in the linear configuration, with an acceleration of 20kV and 80 ns delay.  External calibration using<br><br>
oligosaccharide standards was used for mass assignment of the ions. The spectra from 200 laser shots were summed to obtain the final spectrum.<br>
Antigen binding assay<br>
The purified, monomeric himianized antibody variants were tested for binding to human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also referred to in the hterature as HER-1 or ErbBl) on the A431 human epideimal cell line, using a flow cytometry-based assay, 200,000 cells (e.g., fix)m human A431 cell line) in 180 fil FACS buffer (PBS contammg 2% FCS and 5mM EDTA) were transferred to 5 ml polystyrene tubes and 20 fil 10 fold concentrated anti-EGFR antibody (primary antibody) samples (1-5000 ng/ml final concentration) or PBS only were added. After gently mixing the samples, the tubes were incubated at 4**C for 30min in the daric Subsequently, samples were washed twice with FACS buffer and pelleted at 300 x g for 3min. Supernatant was aspirated off and cells were taken up in 50 ^il FACS buffer and 2 fil secondary antibody (anti-Fc-specific F(ab')2-FITC fragments (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, USA)) was added and the tubes were incubated at 4°C for 30niin. Samples were washed twice with FACS buffer and taken up in 500 fil of FACS buffer for analysis by Flow Cytometry. Binding was determined by plotting the geometric mean fluorescence against the antibody concentrations.<br>
Binding of monomeric IgGl glycovariants to FcyRIIIA-expressing CHO cell line<br>
CHO cells were transfected by electroporation (280 V, 950 jiF, 0.4 cm) with an expression vector coding for theFcgainmaRIIIA-Vall58 a-chain and the y-chain. Transfectants were selected by addition of 6 ^g/ml puromycin and stable clones were analyzed by FACS using 10 (il FITC-conjugated-anti-FcgammaRUI 3G8 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences, allschwil/Switzerland) for 106 cells. Binding of IgGl to FcgammaRIIIA-Vall58-expressing CHO cells was performed. Briefly, the anti-FcgammaRIIIA 3G8 F(ab*)2 fragments (Ancell, Bayport, MN/USA) were added at a concentration of 10 ng/ml to compete binding of antibody glycovariants (3 jig/ml). The fluorescence intensity referring to the bound antibody variants was determined on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, AUschwil /Switzerland).<br><br>
ADCC assay<br>
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used as effector cells and were prepared using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma Diagnostics Inc., St. Louis, M063178 USA) following essentially the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, venous blood was taken with heparinized syringes from healthy volunteers. The blood was diluted 1:0.75-1,3 with PBS (not containing Ca"*^ or Mg^ and layered on Histopaque-1077. The gradient was centrifuged at 400 x g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) without breaks. The interphase containing the PBMC was collected and washed with PBS (SO ml per cells from two gradients) and harvested by centrifugation at 300 x g for 10 minutes at RT. After resuspension of the pellet v^th PBS, the PBMC were counted and washed a second time by centrifugation at 200 x g for 10 minutes at RT. The cells were then resuspended in the appropriate medium for tiie subsequent procedures.<br>
The effector to target ratio used for the ADCC assays was 25:1 and 10:1 for PBMC and NK cells, respectively. The effector cells were prepared in AIM-V medium at the appropriate concentration in order to add 50 jil per well of round bottom 96 well plates. Target cells were human EGFR expressing cells (e.g., A431, EBC-1, or LN229) grown in DMEM containing 10% PCS. Target cells were washed in PBS, coimted and resuspended in AIM-V at 0.3 nullion per ml in order to add 30,000 cells in 100 p.1 per microweil. Antibodies were diluted in AIM-V, added in SO \i\ to the pre-plated target cells and allowed to bind to the targets for 10 minutes at RT, Then the effector cells were added and the plate was incubated for 4 hours at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02. Killing of target cells was assessed by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells using the Cytotoxicity Detection kit (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). After the 4-h6ur incubation the plates were centrifuged at 800 x g. 100 |il supernatant from each well was transferred to a new transparent flat bottom 96 well plate. 100 ^l color substrate buffer from the kit were added per well. The Vmax values of the color reaction were determined in an ELISA reader at 490 nm for at least 10 min using SOFTmax PRO software (Molecular Devices, Sxmnyvale, CA94089, USA). Spontaneous LDH release was measured from wells containing only target and effector cells but no antibodies. Maximal release was determined from wells containing only target cells and 1% Triton X-100. Percentage of specific antibody-mediated killing was calculated as follows: ((x - SR)/(MR - SR)*100,<br><br>
where x is the mean of Vmax at a specific antibody concentration, SR is the mean of Vmax of the spontaneous release and MR is the mean of Vmax of the maxunal release.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Comparison of the binding to human EGF-receptor of antibody variants I-HHA, I-HHB, I-HHC, I-HLA, I-HLB, I-HLC, I-HLal, I-HLA2, I-HLA3, MILA4, I-HLA5, I-HLA6, I-HLA7, I-HLA8, I-HLA-9, I-HHD, I-HHE, I-HHF, and I-HHG, either complexed with the chimeric ICR62 light chain or with the humanized ICR62 light chains (I-KA, I-KB, or I-KQ and the parental, chimeric antibody ch-ICR62 shows that all antibodies have within one log unit similar ECSO values. Only the I-HHA has strongly diminished binding activity (see Figure 2). Figure 1 shows the functional activity of the individual chimeric ICR62 (ch-ICR62) polypeptide chains when combined with the humanized constructs I-HHC and I-KB, respectively. In this experiment, eiherthe light chain, the heavy chain or both chains simultaneously of the ch-ICR62 were replaced by the above mentioned hiunanized constructs. This shows that the VH/VL interface formation seems to work as well in the rodent antibody as well as in the humanized constructs.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the humanized heavy chain I-HHA could not restore<br>
binding activity with either the I-KA, or the I-KB light chain. Since the I-HLA did show<br>
binding with both the I-KA, and the I-KB, the present inventors concluded that the heavy<br>
chain of I-HHA is not functional in antigen binding. Figures 1 and 2, combined with<br>
Figure 3, show that the light chain constructs I-KA, I-KB, and I-KC show binding<br>
1<br>
behavior indistinguishable from the rodent coimterpart. Variant I-KC does not possess any back mutations, and additionally has its CDRl partially humanized, such that residues 24-29 can be derived from the human acceptor sequence (A30 of VKl, as mentioned before).<br>
In the series I-HHA, I-HHB, and I-HHC, only the latter two variants showed satisfactory binding behavior (Figures 2 and 3). Sequence analysis of the I-HHA revealed three potential amino acid residues responsible for this behavior: Lys33, His35, and TyrSO. Constructs that have Lys33 replaced by tyrosine showed good binding, as well as constructs having the TyrSO replaced by tryptophane. Only when these two residues were<br><br>
replaced by alanine and glycine, respectively, was the binding lost. Since I-HHC did not show better binding than I-HHB, the present inventors concluded that residues Asn60, Glu61, Lys64, and Ser65 need not be of rodent origin; or they can be replaced by ala, Gin, Gin, and Gly, respectively. This procedure leads to a construct in which the CDR2 is more humanized, since amino acid positions 60 to 65 are part of the Kabat CDR definition, but there is no need to graft the rodent donor residues for this antibody.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 compare the constructs of the series I-HLal, I-HLA2,1-HLA3,1-HLA4,1-HLA5, and I-HLA6. The best binding behavior was observed in the constructs ch-ICR62, I-HLal, and IHLA2, with an EC50 value of J^prox. 300 ng/ml The other constructs had this value increased by a factor of two, and therefore have slightly reduced binding activity. The first conclusion fix)m this data is that, within the Kabat CDRl, the Lys33Tyr, and the ne34Met substitutions were tolerated. These two positions are located within the Kabat definition of CDRl, but outside of the Chothia CDR boundaries (that were based on structural rather than sequence analysis). In the latter part of CDRl, then, at least some promiscuity is permitted.<br>
The second conclusion is that, within CDR2, in addition to the above-mentioned replacement of residues Asn60 and Glu61 by non-donor residues, Asn60Ser, Glu61Pro, and Lys62Ser non-donor substitutions within the Kabat CDR were also allowed. These residues were derived from the human genn-line IGHV5-51 acceptor sequence, which was used as an FR3 acceptor sequence. Constructs I-HLA3 and I-HLA4 differ from I-HLal and I-HLA2 only by the removal of the Phe27Tyr back mutation, and both the I-HLA3 and I-HLA4 constructs lose affinity compared to their parental construct Therefore, the third conclusion of the comparison of I-HLal, I-HLA2,1-HLA3,1-HLA4, I-HLA5, and I-HLA6 is the involvement of Phe27 in antigen binding, either directly or indirectly, via modifying the loop conformation of CDRl.<br>
Variants I-HLA5 and I-HLA6 have the FRl of I-HLal and I-HLA2, respectively, replaced by another germ-line acceptor sequence with the Phe27 naturally present (/.e., IGHVl-58). This could only be achieved by simultaneously introducing several other mutations which are: Val2Met, ala9Pro, and alal6Thr. By doing so» the beneficial effect of (re-)introducing the Phe27 was again abrogated.<br>
The I-HLA7 construct was assessed to determine whether the restoration of additional donor residues in the heavy chain CDRl and CDR2 of the I-HLA6 construct<br><br>
would restore full binding activity as compared to ICR62. As shown in Figure 6, this was<br>
not the case.<br>
I	As shown in Figures 7 and 8, two additional constructs, I-HLA8 and I-HLA9,<br>
were tested to determine if the full binding activity compared to ch-ICR62 could be achieved. Starting from the I-HHB construct, the FRl regions were replaced by FRl regions having maximal homology within the Chothia CDRl region. The I-HLA8 construct has the FRl of the IGHVl-58 sequence, and the I-HLA9 has the IGHV5-51 FRl region. Both constructs bound the antigen at least as well as the ch-ICR62 antibody. The I-HLA8 construct may, in fact, be even better, with the EC50 lowered by a factor of 2. The I-HLA8 construct has the same FRl sequence as the I-HLA5 and I-HLA6 constructs and therefore has the same non-donor residues (i.e., Val2Met, ala9Pro, and alal6Thr), suggesting that the presence of these non-donor residues does not have a negative effect on binding. Non-beneficial mutations occurring in the I-HLAS and 6 arise from the combination of a VHl FRl paired with a VH5 FR3, which could potentially be compensated for by having a FRl and B FR3 of the same VH family.<br>
Shown in Figure 8 are constructs that contain non-donor residues within the CDRs. Thus, these constructs are even fiirther humanized within the CDRs because the non-donor residues occur in the human framework regions that were chosen for these constructs. The I-HHE (His35Ser), I-HHF (Thr58Asn) and I-HHG (Ser57ala) constructs all have one residue within the CDRl or CDR2 that is humanized (compared to the I-HHB constmct). Construct I-HHD (Gly24ala) was also assayed. I-HHF showed reduced binding indicating the importance of ThrSS. In contrast to the Kabat CDR residue 58, amino acid 57 is more tolerant to substitutions, since the Ser57ala mutation apparently has no influence on binding (Figure 8).<br>
Since the FR3 region of IGHV5-51 seemed to show promising properties in the I-HLal and 2 constructs, and the FRl of the same germ-line sequence proved to be useful in the I-HLA9 construct, the FRl, FR2, and FR3 of IGHV5-51 was designed to be used together as an acceptor for loop grafting.<br>
Summary of the analysis of the canonical residues in humanized ICR62 constructs:<br>
VL:     Kabat position 2; De probably required. Kabat position 71: He or Phe allowed.<br><br>
VH:     Pos. 24, Gly, Thr, ala, Val, Ser allowed. Pos. 26, Gly allowed. Pos. 29, Phe, lie. Leu, Val, Ser allowed. Pos. 34, He, Met, Leu, Val, Trp, Tyr, Thr allowed. Pos. 71, ala, Leu, Val, Thr allowed. Pos 94, Arg, Gly, Asn, Lys, Ser, His, Thr, ala allowed.<br>
Results of the ADCC experiments<br>
Figure 9 shows a comparison of the antibody mediated cellular cyotoxicity (ADCC) is shown for the various glycoforms of the chimeric ICR6Z antibody, as well as for the humanized variant I-HLA4. The different glycoforms are marked by a label that either indicates not-glycoengineered (WT), Glycofonn 1 (Gl), or Glycoform 2 (G2). "Gl" refers to glcyoengineering of the antibody by co-expression with GnTin. "G2" refers to glycoengineering of the antibody by co-expression with GnTID and Manll. "WT" refers to antibodies that were not glycocngineered. The light chain for all the humanized constructs is the I-KC variant, and was not labeled explicitly.<br>
The chimeric, as well as the humanized antibody were improved in their potency and efficacy by the two different glycoengineering approaches. The ch-ICR62 construct perfomied slightly better than I-HLA4 for the wild-type or the glycoforms, respective. As seen in Figure 4, when comparing the affinities of the two antibodies towards their antigen, the ch-ICR62 had a twofold lower EC50 value. This difference in affinity is here reflected in differences in efficacy.<br>
Figure 10 shows a comparison of the antibody mediated cellular cyotoxicity (ADCC) for the non-glycoengineered ("wild-type") and the G2 glycoform of the humanized ICR62 antibody constructs I-HHB and I-HLA7. The same antibodies were applied to two different target cell lines. In panel A of Figure 10, the target cell line LN229 is used; and in panel B of Figure 10, the cell line A431 was used. The A431 cells are apparently more susceptible towards antibody mediated cell killing than the LN229 cells. More importantly, the glycoengineering enhanced the potency of both antibodies. This effect seemed to be more pronounced for the I-HLA7 than for the I-HHB. The percentage of cell killing at maximal antibody concentration for the I-HHB could be shifted from -30% to -40% by introducing the G2 glycocngineered variant, when using the LN229 target cell line. When using the A431 cell line, this value was apparently<br><br>
unchanged. This behavior was completely different for the I-HLA7 antibody. Target cell killing at maximal antibody concentration was shifted from about 10% to about 50%, for the LN229 cells, and from about 40% to about 70% ifor the A431 cells by introducing the G2 glycoengineering variants. In this case, despite having lower activity in the non glycoengineered antibody for the I-HLA7 relative to I-HHB, the ranking of activity is reversed for the glycoengineered antibodies. Figures II and 12 also show comparisons of non-glycoengineered forms (WT) and G2 glcyoforms of chimeric ICR62 and the humanized ICR62 antibody constructs I-HHB and I-HLA7.<br>

Preliminary toxicity study by intravenous (bolus) administration to<br>
cynomolgus monkeys - Toxicokinetics<br>
Summary<br>
Three groups of cynomolgus monkeys (1 male and 1 female per group) were administered intravenous bolus doses of anti-EGFR on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day toxicity study in order to assess the systemic exposure of the animals to anti-EGFR. Serum concentrations of anti-EGFR in samples collected up to 672 hours after the first dose were detemiined by means of an immunoassay method. Pharmacokinetic analysis of serum concentration-time data resulted in the following pharmacokinetic parameters:<br><br><br>
The rate and extent of systemic exposure of monkeys to anti-EGFR, characterised by AU168, increased approximately proportionately with increasing dose over the dose range 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/occasion but by more than the proportionate dose increase over the dose range 4.5 to 12 mg/kg/occasion on Day 1. At the highest dose (12 mg/kg/occasion) the AUC168 was ca 2.8-fold higher than that predicted by a linear relationship.<br>
The extent (AUC168) of systemic exposure of female monkeys to anti-EGFR was generally similar to the exposure in male monkeys.<br>
After repeated intravenous doses, the pre-dose serum concentrations of anti-EGFR were generally higher than those values after a single dose and indicated accumulation of anti-EGFR in serum throughout the period of the study.<br>
The terminal half-life could not be estimated adequately for all animals, but where it could be estimated was in the range 32.5 to 63.1 hours, and appeared to increase with dose in male animals. Total serum clearance of anti-EGFR appeared to be independent of<br><br>
dose over the range 1.5 - 4.5 mg/kg/occasion but was reduced at the top dose level in male and female monkeys.<br>
	In conclusion, the extent of systemic exposure of cynomolgus monkeys to anti-<br>
EGFR appeared to be characterised by non-linear (dose-dependent) kinetics over the dose range L5 to 12 mg/kg/occasion on Day 1 of the intravenous toxicity study. Increasing the dose of anti-EGFR above 4,5 mg/kg/occasion is likely to result in a higher systemic exposure than would be predicted from a linear relationship, which is consistent with the possibiUty of a capacity limited process for the elimination of anti-EGFR.<br>
I	In addition, the study also provided evidence that in general there were no<br>
differences in the systemic exposure of male and female monkeys to anti-EGFR and that there was accumulation after repeated intravenous administration.<br>
Introduction<br>
I	Three groups of one male and one female cynomolgus monkey were administered<br>
anti-EGFR by intravenous bolus injection, at dose levels of 1.5, 4.5 and 12 mg/kg/occasion on Days 1, 8,15 and 22 of a preliminary toxicity study. Blood samples were taken from each animal at the following time-points following administration on Day 1; 1,4,12,24, 72 and 120 hours post-dose. In addition, samples were taken pre-dose and at 1 hour post-dose on Days 8, 15 and 22 and at 672 hours after the first dose on Dayl, The separated serum was frozen at ca -20oC prior to analysis of serum concentrations of anti-EGFR by an immunoassay method.<br>

Antibody used for study<br>
Glyco-mAb (Anti-EGFR), an anti-EGFR antibody Fc-engineered for increased Fc-FcgammaRlII receptor binding affinity and increased ADCC, was produced, purified and characterized as described above. Briefly, antibody was produced by co-transfection of HEK-293-EBNA cells with plasmid DNA vectors for expression of I-HHB antibody heavy chain, I-KC antibody light chain, GnT-III and Manll. A linearly scaled-up version of the transfection method described above was employed, transfecting cell monolayers cultured in roller bottles instead of T-flasks. An additional flow-through anion-exchange chromatographic step using Q-sepharose matrix was included in the purification process immediately before the size exclusion chromatographic step described above.<br>
The glycosylation pattern of the Fc-engineered antibody was analyzed as described above using MalDI/TOF-MS spectrometry of enzymatically released Fc-derived oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharide profile is shown in Figure 23.<br>
Binding to human BGFR and monkey EGFR was demonstrated by whole-cell binding as described above using A431 and COS-7 cells, respectively, and FACS-based analysis. Binding curves are shown in Figures 24 and 25 respectively.<br>
Increased FcgammaRQI receptor binding resulting from the applied Fc engineering was demonstrated as described above using whole cell binding to CHO cells engineered for surface expression of human FcgammaRm and FACS-based analysis. Results are shown in Figure 26. Additionally, the engineered antibody has equivalent degree of Fc-engineering to the "Glyco-2" antibody (75% on Fc-oligosaccharides being of non-fucosylated type) described elsewhere (Ferrara, C. et al, J Biol Chem, 2005 Dec 5; [E-publication ahead of print]). Such Fc-engineered antibodies have up to 50-fold increased binding affinity for human FcgammaRIU relative to a standard non-Fc engineered antibody (Equilibrium dissociation constanst of 15 and 150 nM for the 158V and 158F polymorphic variants of the human receptor vs. 750 and 5000 nM for the same receptor variants, respectively, when binding to non-Fc engineered human IgGl antibodies).<br><br>
ADCC was measured as described aboved using two target cell lines: A549 human lung carcinoma cells and CYNOM-Kl cynomolgus monkey keratinocyte cells. Results are shown in Figure 27 and 28, respectively.<br>
Data processing<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the computer program WinNonlin Pro version 3.3 (Pharsight Corporation, USA).<br>
all serum concentrations supplied as part of this study were reported to 4 significant figures or 3 decimal places. Pharmacokinetic parameters were reported as follows: Cmax, AUC168, CL and Vss to 4 significant figures; k to 4 decimal places; t«/, to 1 decimal place.<br>

Toxicokinetics<br>
Maximum serum concentrations of anti-EGFR (Cmax) and their times of occurrence (Tmax) were the observed values. Areas under the serum anti-EGFR concentration-time curves within a 168-hour dosing interval (AUC168),were estimated by the linear trapezoidal rule. In the calculation of AUC168 values the serum anti-EGFR concentrations at zero hours were estimated by back extrapolation using log-linear regression analysis, based on the first two sampling times, however, if the serum concentration did not decline during this period then the serum concentration at zero hours was considered to be equivalent to the concentration at the first sampling time. Areas under the serum anti-EGFR concentration-time curves to infinite time (AUG), were estimated by the following expression:<br>
AUC = AUC168 + Clast/k<br>
Where Clast is the predicted serum concentration at the last quantifiable sample point and k is the terminal rate constant<br>
Terminal rate constants (k) were estimated by fitting a linear regression of log concentration against time. For the estimate of k to be accepted as reliable, the following criteria were imposed:<br><br>
1.	The terminal data points were apparently randomly distributed about a single straight line (on visual inspection)<br>
2.	A minimum of 3 data points was available for the regression<br>
3.	The regression coefficient was &gt;0,95, and the fraction of the variance<br>
accounted for was &gt;0.90<br>
4.	The interval including the data points chosen for the regression was at least<br>
two-fold greater than the half-life itself<br>
Terminal half-lives (t1/2) were calculated as In2/k. Total serum clearance (CL) was calculated as Dose / AUC, Volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) was calculated as DoseAUMC/AUC2. Accumulation (R) was assessed as the ratio of the trough concentration following the last dose (Day 22) to the trough concentration following the first dose (Day 1) Le. serum concentration at 672 hours/ serum concentration at 168 hours (pre-dose on Day 8).<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Blood samples were taken up to 120 hours after dosing on Day 1; at pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose on Days 8, 15 and 22, and at 672 hours post dosing on Day 1 during a toxicity study to assess the systemic exposure of male and female monkeys to anti-EGFR following intravenous bolus administration of anti-EGFR at dose levels of 1,5,4.5 and 12 mg/kg/occasion on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the study. Serum concentrations of anti-EGFR in samples taken up to 168 hours post-dose are presented in Tables 27-29, and the mean serum concentration-time profiles are illustrated in Figures 18 and 19.<br>
Pharmacokinetic parameters of anti-EGFR are presented in Table 50, and the AUCi68 values are summerised below:<br><br>
The times at which the maximum serum concentrations occurred (Tmax) were generally 1 hour post-dose (the first sample point) but occurred at 4 hours post-dose (the<br><br>
second sample point) in females 2F462 (4.5 mg/kg) and 3F612 (12 mg/kg). However, for both these females, the concentrations at 4 hours post-dose were very similar to those concentrations at 1 hour post-dose and were probably withm the variability of the assay. Therefore the apparent delay in Tmax is unlikely to be of any significance.<br>
Serum concentrations of anti-EGFR prior to the succeeding dose were quantifiable in all animals except male 2M461 on Day 22 (4.5 mg/kg/occasion dose level) therefore, in general, animals were continuously exposed to quantifiable concentrations of anti-EGFR during a dosing interval.<br>
The relationships between areas under the serum anti-EGFR concentration-time curves (AUC168) and dose level on Day 1 are presented below:<br><br>
The rate and extent of systemic exposure of monkeys to anti-EGFR, characterised by AUC168, increased approximately proportionately with increasing dose over the dose range 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg/occasion but by more than the proportionate dose increase over the dose range 4.5 to 12 mg/kg/occasion on Day 1. At the highiest dose (12 mg/kg/occasion) the AUC168 was ca 2.8-fold higher than that predicted by a linear relationship (Figure 20).<br>
The extent (AUC168) of systemic exposure of female monkeys to anti-EGFR was generally similar to the exposure in male monkeys.<br>
After repeated intravenous doses, the pre-dose serum concentrations of anti-EGFR were generally higher than those values after a smgle dose (Figures 21-22) and indicated accumulation of anti-EGFR in serum throughout the period of the study. This accumulation was generally lower in females than in males, except at the highest dose level. The ratios of the trough (pre-dose) concentrations following the last dose on Day 22 (672 hours post Day 1 dose) to the trough concentration following the first dose on Day 1 are presented in the Table 26, below:<br><br><br>
The terminal rate constants (k), and corresponding terminal half-lives (t1/2), of anti-EGFR on Day 1 are presented in Table 30. The terminal half-life could not be estimated adequately for all animals, but where it could be estimated was in the range 32.5 to 63.1 hours, and appeared to increase with dose in male animals. Total serum clearance of anti-EGFR speared to be independent of dose over the range l.S - 4.S mg/kg/occasion but was reduced at the highest dose level in male and female monkeys.<br>
In conclusion, the extent of systemic exposure of cynomolgus monkeys to anti-EGFR appeared to be characterised by non-linear (dose-dependent) kinetics over the dose range 1.5 to 12 mg/kg/occasion on Day 1 of the intravenous toxicity study. Increasing the dose of anti-EGFR above 4.5 mg/kg/occasion is likely to result in a higher systemic exposure than would be predicted from a linear relationship, which is consistent with the possibility of a capacity limited process for the elimination of anti-EGFR.<br>
In addition, the study also provided evidence that in general there were no differences in the systemic exposure of male and female monkeys to anti-EGFR and that there was accumulation after repeated intravenous administration.<br><br>

Conclusions<br>
There was no effect of treatment at the injection sites and no clinical findings considered to be related to treatment with Glyco-mAb (anti-EGFR). Bodyweight changes were within normal expected ranges. There were no findings considered to be related to treatment at macroscopic examination and organ weights of animals were within normal expected ranges. In conclusion, treatment at 1.5, 4.5 or 12 mg/kg/occasion was well tolerated with no clear findings of systemic toxicity.<br>
EGFR is not a tumor specific target, since it is present on the surface of various normal tissues including liver, kidney and skin. Anti-EGFR antibodies with human IgGl Fc region have previously been administered to humans and have shown a tolerable side-effect profile (Vanhoefer, U. et al, Clin. Oncol. 2004 Jan 1;22(1): 175-84; Needle MN, Semin Oncol 2002 Oct;29 (5 Suppl 14):55-60). Clearly, there would be significant concerns for administering to a human or other mammal an anti-EGFR antibody with significantly increased ADCC, due to enhanced killing activity that could be displayed against critical nonnal tissues such as liver, kidney and skin. Surprisingly), the present inventors have found that administering such an anti-EGFR antibody, Fc engineered as described above and with up to 1000-fold increased ADCC activity, in vivo to mammals did not lead to significant toxicities. The concentrations of antibody were kept above 1 microgram per milliliter for at least 4 weeks (and above 100 micrograms per milliliter for some animals). Such exposure levels are typical for antibody therapy. Maximal ADCC for the antibody of this study is already achieved at concentrations of 1 microgram per milliliter. Single dose administrations of doses of 40 and 100 mg of anti-EGFR antibody (the parental rat ICR62 antibody) to human cancer patients have shown specific targeting of tumors in vivo (Modjtahedi, H, et al, Br J Cancer. 1996 Jan;73(2);228-35.). Cynomolgus monkey effector cells have highly-homologous FcgammaRIII receptor and have been shown to mediate enhanced ADCC with Fc engineered antibodies (and with antibodies glycoengineered for increased levels of non-fucosylated oligosaccharides in the Fc region). The level of ADCC increase is very similar to that observed with human effector cells (PBMCs).<br>
In summary, we have found that anti-EGFR antibodies Fc engineered for increased Fc-FcgammaRIII binding affinity and for increased ADCC can be administered to mammals to give concentrations above 1 microgram of antibody per milliliter of serum<br><br>
for a period of at least 4 weeks in order to give drug exposures normally associated with significant accumulation of antibody on target cells in vivo, without leading to significant toxicity.<br>
Toxicity of an antigen binding molecule of the present invention can be measured and/or determined using any of the methods and/or parameters (e.g. blood chemistry values, histopathological indicators, etc.) described herein above, or by any means known to those of skill in the art. A clinically significant level of toxicity is understood by one of skill in the art to be a level that exceeds levels generally accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for antibodies administered clinically.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Modifications to the Light Chain CDRs<br>
I	Using methods described above, anti-EGFR light chain variable region variants<br>
were generated from the I-KC light chain variable region construct (SEQ ID NO:43 and SEQ ID NO:45), wherein the sequence encoding the amino acid residue at varous positions in the rat ICR62 CDRs were replaced with the corresponding amino acid residue from a human gennline variable gene sequence. Table 38 shows the substitutions that were made within the CDRs of the I-KC light chain variable region construct (SEQ ID NO:45):<br><br><br><br>
all substitution residues identified above were derived from the human VK1_6 acceptor sequence except for the Y32W exchange, wherein the W of a related human germline sequence was substituted for the Y at position 32 in SEQ ID NO:45.<br>
Each of the I-KC variant constructs (I-KCl to I-KC9) was paired with a heavy chain variable region comprising construct I-HHD (SEQ ID NO: 16 and SEQ ID NO: 15) and a binding assay performed according to the methods described in the previous examples. Constructs I-KCl to I-KC9 were compared to the I-KC construct (SEQ ID NO:46 and SEQ ID NO:45) for binding affinity to EGFR in A431 target cells (Figure 29). As seen in Figure 29, only the modfication of residue 34 to its corresponding human sequence (N34G) resulted in a slight decrease in binding affinity (EC50 value increased by a factor of 10). all other constructs retained binding activity comparable to the I-KC construct (SEQ ID NO:45). Therefore, when paired with a chimeric (e.g., humanized) heavy chain construct specific for EGFR, the light chain can be entirely human (e.g., from a human light chain V gene sequence) and still retain specific binding for EGFR. In particular, CDR2 and CDR3 can be entirely in human germline form.<br>
Antigen Binding Molecules Comprising EGFR-specific CDRs<br>
The present invention therefore contemplates an antigen binding molecule comprising a chimeric (e.g., humanized) heavy chain variable region comprising EGFR-specific CDRs paired with a light chain variable region, wherein the light chain variable region has fewer than ten non-human amino acid residues. In other embodiments, the light chain variable region has fewer than nine, eight seven, six, five, four, three, two, or one non-human amino acid residue(s). In preferred embodiments, the light chain variable region has fewer than two or fewer than one (i.e., no) non-human amino acid residues. In one embodiment, the light chain variable region comprises one or more human germline variable region gene sequences. Human germline variable region gene sequences encoding light chain variable regions are known in the art, and can be found, for example, in the IMGT database, available at http://imgt,cines.fr/home.html. In a preferred embodiment, the the human germline sequence is derived from the VK1_6 germline<br><br>
sequence. In other embodiments, amino acid residues within the human germline light chain variable region amino acid sequence can be substituted with one or more residues from another human germline light chain variable region sequence.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to an antigen binding molecule comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID N0.:1; SEQ ID No:3; SEQ ID No:5; SEQ ID No:7; SEQ ID No:9; SEQ ID No:ll; SEQ ID No:13; SEQ ID No:15; SEQ ID No:17; SEQ ID No:19; SEQ ID No:21; SEQ ID No:23; SEQ ID No:25; SEQ ID No:27; SEQ ID No:29; SEQ ID No:31; SEQ ID No33; SEQ ID No:35; SEQ ID No:37; SEQ ID No:39; and SEQ ID No:121, and a light chain comprising a polypeptide encoded by one or more human germline variable gene sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the human germline sequence is derived from the VK1_6 gerailine sequence.<br>

In a particular embodiment, the human germline sequence is derived from the VK1_6 germline sequence. In another embodiment, the human germline variable region gene sequence comprises the VK1_6 germline gene sequence with a substitution of one or more amino acid codons with a sequence from a different human germline light chain variable region gene sequence.<br>
I	In other embodiments, the antigen binding molecule of the present invention<br>
comprises an EGFR-specific heavy chain variable region of the present invention, and a variant of SEQ ID NO:45. In one embodiment, the variant of SEQ ID NO:45 comprises an amino acid substitution at one or more positions in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). In specific embodiments, the substitution is of an amino acid residue at<br><br>
a position selected from the group consisting of: ammo acid position 30 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 32 of SEQ ED NO:45; amino acid position 34 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 50 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 51 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 52 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 53 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 56 of SEQ ID NO:45; amino acid position 94 of SEQ ID NO:45; and any combination of substitutions thereof. In more specific embodiments, the substitution in SEQ ID NO:45 is selected firom the group consisting of: substitution of an arginine (R) for the asparagine (N) at position 30 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a tryptophan (W) for the tyrosine (Y) at position 32 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a glycine (G) for the asparagine (N) at position 34 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a threonine (T) for the asparagine (N) at position 50 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of an alanine (A) for the threonine (T) at position 51 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a serine (S) for the asparagine (N) at position 52 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a serine (S) for the asparagine (N) at position 53 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a serine (S) for the threonine (T) at position 56 of SEQ ID NO:45; substitution of a tyrosine (Y) for the phenylalanine (F) at position 94 of SEQ ID NO:45; and any combination thereof. In a particular embodiment, all of these substitutions of amino acid residues in SEQ ID NO:45 are incorporated in a single light chain variant. In preferred embodiments, antigen binding molecules comprising the light chain variants with amino acid substitutions for the ICR62 CDRs retain specific binding to EGFR (as compared to an antigen binding molecule comprising a light chain variable region comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:45) when the light chain variant is paired with a polypeptide comprising a heavy chain variable region of the present invention.<br>
