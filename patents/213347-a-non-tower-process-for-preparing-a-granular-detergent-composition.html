				<td>PROCESS FOR MAKING A LOW DENSITY DETERGENT COMPOSITION BY NON<br>
TOWER PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a non-tower process for producing a low density detergent composition. More particularly, the invention is directed to a continuous process during which detergent agglomerates are produced by feeding a surfactant and coating materials into a series of mixers. The process produces a free flowing, detergent composition whose density can be adjusted for wide range of consumer needs, and which can be commercially sold.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, there has been considerable interest within the detergent industry for laundry detergents which are "compact" and therefore, have low dosage volumes. To facilitate production of these so-called low dosage detergents, many attempts have been made to produce high bulk density detergents, for example with a density of 600 g/1 or higher. The low dosage detergents are currently in high demand as they conserve resources and can be sold in small packages which are more convenient for consumers. However, the extent to which modern detergent products need to be "compact" in nature remains unsettled. In fact, many consumers,<br>
* ~*s<br>
especially in developing countries, continue to prefer a higher dosage levels in their respective laundering operations. One characteristic common to the existing process for producing modern detergent composition by agglomeration, namely, non-tower process, is that the apparent density of the granules by such process is typically not less than 600 g/1. Consequently, there is a need in the art of agglomeration (e.g., non-tower process) to produce modern detergent compositions for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition, especially for the low density (for example, the range of the density is from about 300g/l to about 600 g/1).<br>
Generally, there are three primary types of processes by which detergent granules or powders can be prepared. The first type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower to produce highly porous detergent granules (e.g., tower process for low density detergent compositions). The second type of process involves spray-drying an aqueous detergent slurry in a spray-drying tower as the first step, then, the resultant granules are<br>
agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant, finally, various detergent components are dry mixed to produce detergent granules (e.g., tower process plus agglomeration process for high density detergent compositions) . In the third type of process, the various detergent components are dry mixed after which they are agglomerated with a binder such as a nonionic or anionic surfactant, to produce high density detergent compositions (e.g., agglomeration process for high density detergent compositions). In the above three processes, the important factors which govern the density of the resulting detergent granules are the shape, porosity and particle size distribution of said granules, the density of the various starting materials, the shape of the various starting materials, and their respective chemical composition.<br>
There have been many attempts in the art for providing processes which increase the density of detergent granules or powders. Particular attention has been given to densification of spray-dried granules by post tower treatment. For example, one attempt involves a batch process in which spray-dried or granulated detergent powders containing sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium sulfate are densified and spheronized in a Marumerizer®. This apparatus comprises a substantially horizontal, roughened, rotatable table positioned within and at the base of a substantially vertical, smooth walled cylinder. This process, however, is essentially a batch process and is therefore less suitable for the large scale production of detergent powders. More recently, other attempts have been made to provide continuous processes for increasing the density of "post-tower" or spray dried detergent granules. Typically, such processes require a first apparatus which pulverizes or grinds the granules and a second apparatus which increases the density of the pulverized granules by agglomeration. While these processes achieve the desired increase in density by treating or densifying "post tower" or spray dried granules, they are limited in their ability to go higher in surfactant active level without subsequent coating step. In addition, treating or densifying by "post tower" is not favourable in terms of economics (high capital cost) and complexity of operation. Moreover, all of the aforementioned processes are directed primarily for densifying or otherwise processing spray dried granules. Currently, the relative amounts and types of materials subjected to spray drying processes in the production of detergent granules has been limited. For example, it has been difficult to attain high levels of surfactant in the resulting detergent composition, a feature which facilitates production of detergents in a more efficient manner. Thus, it would be desirable to have a process by which detergent compositions can be produced without having the limitations imposed by conventional spray drying techniques.<br>
To that end, the art is also replete with disclosures of processes which entail agglomerating detergent compositions. For example, attempts have been made to agglomerate detergent builders by mixing zeolite and/or layered silicates in a mixer to form free flowing<br>
agglomerates. While such attempts suggest that their process can be used to produce detergent agglomerates, they do not provide a mechanism by which starting detergent materials in the form of pastes, liquids and dry materials can be effectively agglomerated into crisp, free flowing detergent agglomerates having low densities.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art to have an agglomeration (non-tower) process for continuously producing a detergent composition having low density delivered directly from starting detergent ingredients, and preferably the density can be achieved by adjusting the process condition. Also, there remains a need for such a process which is more efficient, flexible and economical to facilitate large-scale production of detergents for flexibility in the ultimate density of the final composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The following references are directed to densifying spray-dried granules: Appel et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,133,924 (Lever); Bortolotti et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,160,657 (Lever); Johnson et al, British patent No. 1,517,713 (Unilever); and Curtis, European Patent Application 451,894.<br>
The following references are directed to producing detergents by agglomeration: Charles et al, U. S. Patent No. 4,992,079 (FMC Corporation), Beujean et al, Laid-open No.WO93/23,523 (Henkel), Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble); Capeci et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,366,652 (Procter &amp; Gamble); Hollingsworth et al, European Patent Application 351,937 (Unilever); and Swatling et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,205,958.<br>
For example, the Laid-open No.WO93/23,523 describes the process comprising pre-agglomeration by a low speed mixer and further agglomeration step by high speed mixer for obtaining high density detergent composition with less than 25 wt % of the granules having a diameter over 2 mm. This disclosure also describes a process by which the density of the final agglomerate can be adjusted by adjusting the amount of liquid binder added in the second mixer. It is not clear from the disclosure on what contributes to the density reduction. The process in Laid-open No. WO93/23,523 differs from the invention disclosed herein which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The U. S. Patent No. 4,992,079 describes agglomeration process for low density non-phosphate detergents having increased resistance to non ionic bleeding. The first process step agglomerates detergent ingredients with non aqueous liquid surfactant. The first step is, followed by a second agglomeration step where the surfactant loaded particles are dispersed into an inert gaseous medium, wetting the dispersed particles with atomized stream of aqueous sodium silicate or with separate atomized streams of water and concentrated sodium silicate to form the agglomerate detergent. It is not clear from the disclosure on what contributes to the low density.<br>
In addition, the disclosure does not include aqueous surfactants and phosphate containing detergents. The process in the U.S. patent No. 4,992,079 differs from the invention disclosed herein which will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>

(The definition of the surfactants and the fine powders are described in detail hereinafter.)<br>
In another embodiment of the invention which is discussed more fully below, the surfactant(s) can be initially fed into a mixer or pre-mixer (e.g. a conventional screw extruder or other similar mixer) prior to agglomeration, after which the mixed detergent materials are fed into the first step mixer as described herein for agglomeration.<br>
Generally speaking, to achieve the low density (from about 300 g/1 to about 600 g/1), 'preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 5 to about 30 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 5 m/s to about 10 m/s, the energy per unit mass in the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 4.20 kj/kg, more preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 10 to about 15 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 6 m/s to about 8 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 2.5 kj/kg, and most preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 10 to about 15 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 6.5 m/s to about 7.5 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 1.30 kj/kg.<br>
The examples of mixers for the first step can be any types of mixer known to the skilled in the art, as long as the mixer can maintain the above mentioned condition for the first step. An Example can be Lodige CB Mixer manufactured by the Lodige company (Germany). As the result of the first step, granules having fine powders on the surface of the granules can be obtained (FIG. 1).<br>
Second Step<br>
In the second step of the process, the resultant product of the first step (granules and excess fine powders) is fed into a second mixer, and then finely atomized liquid is sprayed on the granules in the mixer. In order to bind the excessive fine powders onto the granules from the first step, about 0-10% , more preferably about 2-5% of powder detergent ingredients of the kind used in the first step and/or other detergent ingredients can be added to the second step.<br>
Generally speaking, to achieve the low density (from about 300 g/1 to about 600 g/1), preferably, the mean residence time of the mixer for the second step is from about 0.2 to about 5 seconds and tip speed of the mixer for the second step is in range from about 10 m/s to about 23 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer (energy condition) for the second step is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 2.9 kj/kg, more preferably, the mean residence time of the mixer is from about 0.5 to about 2 seconds and tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 13 m/s to about<br>
20 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 1.9 kj/kg, the most preferably, the mean residence time in the mixer is from about 0.5 to about 2 seconds, tip speed for the mixer is in range from about 15 m/s to about 17.5 m/s, the energy per unit mass for the mixer is from about 0.15 kj/kg to about 1.0 kj/kg.<br>
The examples of mixers for the second step can be any types of mixer known to the skilled in the art, as long as the mixer can maintain the above mentioned condition for the first step. An Example can be Flexomic Model manufactured by the Schugi company (Netherlands). As the result of the second step, granular detergent composition can be obtained (FIG. 2).<br>
The process in the present invention surprisingly reduce the amount of excess recycle fines from the second step, comparing to the amount of excess recycle fines due to common agglomeration processes known to the skilled in the art. The existence of excess fines leads to excessive recycle streams which disrupt the process and are therefore not economically favourable.<br>

The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein as a detergent builder preferably have both a high calcium ion exchange capacity and a high exchange rate. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such high calcium ion exchange rate and capacity are a function of several interrelated factors which derive from the method by which the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is produced. In that regard, the aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein are preferably produced in accordance with Corkill et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509 (Procter &amp; Gamble), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Preferably, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material is in "sodium" form since the potassium and hydrogen forms of the instant aluminosilicate do not exhibit as high of an exchange rate and capacity as provided by the sodium form. Additionally, the aluminosilicate ion exchange material preferably is in over dried form so as to facilitate production of crisp detergent agglomerates as described herein. The aluminosilicate ion exchange materials used herein preferably have particle size diameters which optimize their effectiveness as detergent builders. The term "particle size diameter" as used herein represents the average particle size diameter of a given aluminosilicate ion exchange material as determined by conventional analytical techniques, such as microscopic determination and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The preferred particle size diameter of the aluminosilicate is from about 0.1 micron to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 0.5 microns to about 9 microns. Most preferably, the particle size diameter is from about 1 microns to about 8 microns.<br>

It is preferable for the above polymer solution to be pre-complex with anionic surfactant such as NaLAS.<br>
Other preferable examples of the aqueous or non-aqueous polymer solutions which can be used as the finely atomized liquid in the present inventions are polymeric polycarboxylate dispersants which can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid.

See U.S. Patent 3,936,537, issued February 3, 1976 to Baskerville, Jr. et al., incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other builders can be generally selected from the various water-soluble, alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium phosphates, polyphosphates, phosphonates, polyphosphonates, carbonates, berates, polyhydroxy sulfonates, polyacetates, carboxylates, and polycarboxylates. Preferred are the alkali metal, especially sodium, salts of the above. Preferred for use herein are the phosphates, carbonates, C10-18fatty acids, polycarboxylates, and mixtures thereof. More preferred are sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, citrate, tartrate mono- and di-succinates, and mixtures thereof (see below).<br>
In comparison with amorphous sodium silicates, crystalline layered sodium silicates exhibit a clearly increased calcium and magnesium ion exchange capacity. In addition, the layered sodium silicates prefer magnesium ions over calcium ions, a feature necessary to insure that substantially all of the "hardness" is removed from the wash water. These crystalline layered sodium silicates, however, are generally more expensive than amorphous silicates as well as other builders. Accordingly, in order to provide an economically feasible laundry detergent, the proportion of crystalline layered sodium silicates used must be determined judiciously.<br>
The crystalline layered sodium silicates suitable for use herein preferably have the formula<br>
wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is from about 1.9 to about 4 and y is from about 0 to about 20. More preferably, the crystalline layered sodium silicate has the formula<br>

Polymeric polycarboxylate builders are set forth in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such materials include the water-soluble salts of homo- and copolymers of aliphatic carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, fumaric acid, aconitic acid, citraconic acid and methylene malonic acid. Some of these materials are useful as the water-soluble anionic polymer as hereinafter described, but only if in intimate admixture with the non-soap anionic surfactant.<br>

These polyacetal carboxylates can be prepared by bringing together under polymerization conditions an ester of glyoxylic acid and a polymerization initiator. The resulting polyacetal carboxylate ester is then attached to chemically stable end groups to stabilize the polyacetal<br>
carboxylate against rapid depolymerization in alkaline solution, converted to the corresponding salt, and added to a detergent composition. Particularly preferred polycarboxylate builders are the ether carboxylate builder compositions comprising a combination of tartrate monosuccinate and tartrate disuccinate described in U.S. Patent 4,663,071, Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

As for a comparison to the present invention, a photograph of high density agglomerates (an average density is about 700 - 800g/l) obtained by a series of the mixers operated under different conditions from the present invention is shown as FIG. 4. For FIG. 4, Lodige CB mixer (CB-30, operated at 550 RPM), then Schugi Flexomic mixer (operated at 2800RPM),finally Lodige KM mixer (KM-600, operated at 100 RPM with normal plows) were used for agglomeration. The material used for obtaining agglomerates of FIG.4 is the same as Example 2, filly described in the "EXAMPLES".<br>
Optional Process Steps<br>
One optional step in the process is drying, if it is desired to reduce level of moisture in the agglomerates from the second step. This can be accomplished by a variety of apparatus, well known to these skilled in the art. Fluid bed apparatus is preferred, and will be referred to in the discussion which follows.<br>
In another optional step of the present process, the detergent agglomerates exiting the fluid bed dryer are further conditioned by additional cooling in cooling apparatus. The preferred apparatus is a fluid bed. Another optional process step involves adding a coating agent to improve flowability and/or minimize over agglomeration of the detergent composition in one or more of the following locations of the instant process: (1) the coating agent can be added<br>
directly after the fluid bed cooler or dryer; (2) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer and the fluid bed cooler; (3) the coating agent may be added between the fluid bed dryer and a moderate speed mixer for agglomeration which is commonly known to the skilled in the art ; and/or (4) the coating agent may be added directly to a moderate speed mixer for agglomeration which is commonly known to the skilled in the art and the fluid bed dryer. The coating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of aluminosilicates, silicates, carbonates and mixtures thereof. The coating agent not only enhances the free flowability of the resulting detergent composition which is desirable by consumers in that it permits easy scooping £or detergent during use, but also serves to control agglomeration by preventing or minimizing over, agglomeration, especially when added directly to the moderate speed mixer. As those skilled in the art are well aware, over agglomeration can lead to very undesirable flow properties and aesthetics of the final detergent product.<br>
Optionally, the process can comprise the step of spraying an additional binder in one or both of the first and second mixers for the present invention or fluid bed dryers and/or fluid bed coolers. A binder is added for purposes of enhancing agglomeration by providing a "binding" or "sticking" agent for the detergent components. The binder is preferably selected from the group consisting of water, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, liquid silicates, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone polyacrylates, citric acid and mixtures thereof. Other suitable binder materials including those listed herein are described in Beerse et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,108,646 (Procter &amp; Gamble Co.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other optional steps contemplated by the present process include screening the oversized detergent agglomerates in a screening apparatus which can take a variety of forms including but not limited to conventional screens chosen for the desired particle size of the finished detergent product. Other optional steps include conditioning of the detergent agglomerates by subjecting the agglomerates to additional drying by way of apparatus discussed previously.<br>
Another optional step of the instant process entails finishing the resulting detergent agglomerates by a variety of processes including spraying and/or admixing other conventional detergent ingredients. For example, the finishing step encompasses spraying perfumes, brighteners and enzymes onto the finished agglomerates to provide a more complete detergent composition. Such techniques and ingredients are well known in the art.<br>
The representative examples of the series of mixers to make granular detergent compositions according to the process of the present invention plus optional processes are as follows:<br>
A. (l)agglomeration in Lodige CB Model--(2) and then in Schugi Flexomic Model --(3) sizing in a Mogensens sizer to remover particles over 4.5 mm —(4) drying in a Fluid Bed Dryer —(5)<br>
cooling in a Fluid Bed Cooler --(6) sizing in a Mogensen sizer to remove over 1.2 mm --(7) grinding to reduce over size agglomerates from the sizers— and (8) feeding ground agglomerates back to the fluid bed dryer or fluid bed cooler or Lodige CB mixer;<br>
B. (1) agglomeration in Lodige CB Model--(2) then in Lodige KM Model--(S) further in Schugi Flexomic Model --(4) sizing in a Mogensens sizer to remove particles over 4.5 mm —(5) drying in a Fluid Bed Dryer --(6) cooling in a Fluid Bed Cooler-- (7) sizing in a Mogensen sizer to remove over 1.2 mm —(8) grinding to reduce over size agglomerates from the sizers-- and (9) feeding ground agglomerates back to the fluid bed dryer or fluid bed cooler or Lodige CB mixer.<br>
The other essential step in the process involves high active paste structuring process, e.g., hardening an aqueous anionic surfactant paste by incorporating a paste-hardening material by using an extruder, prior to the process of the present invention. The details of the high active paste structuring process is disclosed co-application No. JA162F (filed 04 October, 1996) which was filed on the same day as the present invention.<br>
