TITLE<br>
NAME ADDRESS<br>
NATIONALITY<br><br>
A     NOVEL    STAMP    MANUFACTURING PROCESS<br>
NEMADE RAJAN   PANDHARINATH<br>
AP. :-NIMBHORA, TAL :- RAVER, DIST.:-JALGAON MAHARASHTRA STATE, INDIA 425506.<br>
INDIAN.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Introduction and Preliminaries:<br>
A stamp means either 1) a plate of rubber/ nylon/ solid polymer/ liquid polymer mounted on any handle made up of wood/ plastic/ pvc/ self ink or 2)A porous material (for example a foam ) that is mounted on a handle and in which<br>
(a)An Ink is suspended and retained in it in normal conditions by its capillary action<br>
and<br>
(b) the ink is facilitated to pass on the required surface (for example paper) by an<br>
application of a pressure.<br>
The handle can be any material (for example wooden/ plastic etc)with a base and a<br>
griP. Liquid /photo polymer plates are prepared by exposing an UV rays through a<br>
positive / negative photofilm containing the desired impression.The UV rays softens the<br>
plates at parts where they reach. This softened part of the plates is washed with chemicals<br>
that do not affect the hard part of the plates. This process is generally referred as liquid<br>
photo polymer exposure.<br>
Similarly me second variety of the stamps (those made up of porous materia arc manufactured by a method called casting. In a casting, first a die having the shape of the desired matter is generated. Then the porous material powder is poured on this die with an adhesive that can hold together the porous material powder with the desired porosity and that does not stick die material. This solid obtained from the powder is then detached from the die and placed on the desired handle.<br>
Another method of manufacturing a stamp from a porous material (like foam) is by heat treatment to solid foam through a flash light. In this treatment first a printout of the desired matter is taken on a positive film or a tracing paper. Then a flash light is passed through this film/ paper on the porous material, thus heating it exactly at parts not containing the desired matter. The heated part looses is porosity and thus ink can get transfeiTed through only part that is not heated (part that constitutes the desired impression).<br>
The existing stamps till date can produce text matter/ line-art diagram/ line diagram' figures/ monogram/ logo/ trade mark or other such matters of black and white colour. However, non-of these existing stamps till date can generate clear colour scales/ various shades/ a. good quality photograph of any kind..<br>
The main objective of my invention is to design a stamp, which can<br>
(1)	Produce exact image of a figure using appropriate shades even if the given figure is in different colours or shades; each shade representing a particular colour.<br>
(2)	Produce the image of a figure so precise that it can also represent a clear face/actual photograph of a person.<br>
New Observations for Configuration of Plates on a Stamp:<br>
The shades that produce the above mentioned quality of impression are consequences of a group of fine dots configured in a particular manner in a particular area T. If the total area occupied by all the dots is denoted by D, then the remaining empty area<br><br>
(T-D) is occupied by the colour of the paper (most of the time white). This fact is elaborated more with an illustration in the following Figure 1.<br><br>
Total area = T Dl. D2, D3. D4 are areas occupied by respective dots. Dl + D2 + D3 + D4 = D. dl. d2, d3. d4 are the distance between the respective dots shown<br>
Figure 1.<br>
Thus D defines the shade of T. In fact, the darkness of the shade is directly proportional to the size of the dots and inversely proportional to the distance between two dots. The percentage of D in the area T is defined as the colour scale of that portion. The following Figures 2.a. and 2,b. illustrate this fact with two different shades.<br><br>
The distance between two dots is measured in lines per inch (LPI). A line means a sequence of linear dots at a particular distance. Thus,<br>
(1)	50 LPI means that the distance between two consecutive dots is 0.667mm<br>
(2)	70 LPI means that the distance between two consecutive dots is 0.35mm<br>
(3)	110 LPI means that the distance between two consecutive dots is 0.2272mm ...and so on.<br>
See Figures 2.c. and 2.d. below for more elaboration of the above explanation.<br><br><br><br>
Same LPI, different dot size<br><br>
Same dot size, different LPI<br><br><br><br>
D1,D2 are different dot sizes<br>
dl.d2 are different distances between two consecutive dots.<br>
FIGURE 2.c.<br><br>
FIGURE 2.d.<br><br>
Thus we have seen that a particular colour scale is a function of<br>
(1)	The size of the dot<br>
(2)	The LPI<br>
The illustrated figures A, B, C, D and E each show various shades that correspond to various LPI's. Each figure shows 20 sub blocks corresponding to different colour scales. These colour scales vary with the size of the dot.<br>
Similar shades can be generated at any LPI ranging from 20 LPI to 600 LPI.<br>
The dot configuration used in printing application is very fine (in sense, the LPI used ranges from 120 LPI to 360 LPI, i.e., the distance between two consecutive dots is 0.2mm to 0.069mm.). Yet the ink used for impression using these fine dots does not get spread during application on paper because of the following reasons.<br>
(1)	The quality of the ink used is very high<br>
(2)	The ink used is oil based or chemical solvent based<br>
(3)	The impression is taken with the help of machines that are specifically designed to get error free impression and are used under ideal conditions<br>
In case when impressions are taken using a stamp with fine configuration, the ink spreads on the paper due to the following reasons.<br>
(1)	The ink used is of low quality<br>
(2)	The ink used is water based. Because of high intermolecular attraction (high cohesion) and high surface tension (low adhesion), excess ink gets accumulated on each dot of the stamp in the form of a drop<br><br>
(3) The impression is taken in a manner which involves human error<br>
The above difference is clear from the comparative illustrated figure (a), (b), (c). (d), &amp; (A), (B), (C), (D).<br>
Due to the above reasons, even a plain text matter imprinted using a stamp looses clarity. Therefore until today nobody could put up a dot configuration on a stamp which can produce different shades with desired clarity using a water based ink. With the following auxiliary observation, my invention has solved this problem.<br>
(1)	If the distance between two consecutive dots is more than some specific value (less than 40 LPI), the configuration of the dots on the stamp fails to define a shade.<br>
(2)	If the distance between two consecutive dots is less than some specific value (more than 120 LPI or more than 65% colour scale), the configuration of the dots on the stamp fails to define a clear required shade due to spreading of ink.<br>
Figure 3. shows live impression of a stamp with different shades<br>
Thus we observe that a well defined shade is obtained by selecting a colour scale ranging from 0% to 65%. Beyond this range, the ink starts spreading and the impression fails to describe a particular shade.<br>
The above impression in Figure 3. is taken at a dot configuration of 75 LPI (0.333mm distance between two consecutive dots). Similar results are generated from 50 LPI to 120 LPI.<br>
This observation guides us for developing better variety of stamps as given in the following section.<br>
New Developments in Stamp Manufacturing.<br>
The development of stamps takes place in following stages: (1) Composing:<br>
As explained the reasons earlier, the colour scale can be developed by varying either the distance between the dots or by varying the sizes of the dots. If the distance between the dots is too much (low LPI), the figure may not be clear and sharp. If the distance between two consecutive dots is less (i.e., more LPI), the figure gets spoilt because of spreading of ink from one dot to another. Therefore the skill of composing a stamp is in selecting such a range of LPI and sizes of the dots on the stamp that the figure should be precisely indicating the shade and the ink should not get spread on the paper after imprinted.<br>
The Figure 1. above shows actual impressions of a stamp with each block representing a particular gray scale. We see that after 65%, gray scale is not clear. Better results are obtained by selecting the colour scale from 7% to 65% and selecting the LPI from 50 to 120.<br><br>
(2)	Development of Negative:<br>
Development of a negative is done either by camera or by computerized negative systems (Linatronic, etc.).<br>
(3)	Development of a Plate:<br>
Development of a plate in case of polymer/ nylon/ rubber or in case of a pre-ink stamp is done by photopolymer exposure and casting techniques as described in our preliminary section.<br>
(4)	Mounting of a Plate on a Handle:<br>
The complete and final plate is then mounted on the handle.<br>
Thus we can describe in figure our product with new features as in figure 4A and 4B.<br>
Advantages<br>
By selecting proper ranges of dot configuration, different colour shades are developed on a stamp and because of better resolution suitable for water based inks, the impression by a stamp is so clear and sharp that it looks exactly like a printing. Further this proper configuration of dots on a stamp has developed a photograph that is as clear and sharp like printing. Finally these specifically configured stamps have made it possible to do everything that a printing can do.<br><br>
