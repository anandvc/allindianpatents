DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 5-HYDROXYBENZO [b] THIOPHENE-3-CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to 5-hydroxybenzo [b] thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives which are key starting materials for producing compounds useful in the field of pharmaceuticals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
5-Hydroxybenzo [b] thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivatives of the general formula (I) :<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group are important starting materials in the synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds.  For example, a compound of the formula (I) is essential in the synthesis of benzothiophenecarboxamide derivatives of the general formula (VI):<br><br><br>
wherein R is as defined above and X is hydrogen or alkyl. The benzothiophenecarboxamide derivatives are specific antagonists of PGD2 and known to be useful as a drug in the treatment of various diseases related to mast cell dysfunction caused by excessive production of PGD2, for example, systemic mastocytosis, disorder of systemic mast cell activation, tracheal contraction, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria, injury due to ischemic reperfusion, inflammation, and atopic dermatis (WO97/00853, PCT/JP97/04527 {W098/25919)).  Among compounds of the formula (VI), a compound wherein OR is 5-hydroxy and X is hydrogen (hereinafter, referred to as "Compound A") has especially high antagonistic effect on PGD2, showing an excellent anti-nasal occlusion activity, and is contemplated to be a promising drug for treating nasal occlusion.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A process for preparing the above-mentioned compound is illustrated by the following reaction scheme (W098/25919):<br><br><br><br>
In order to clinically apply Compound A widely, it is essential to establish a process for preparing a starting material/ the compound (I), which process is safe, efficient and industrially applicable.<br>
However, it is difficult to synthesize benzothiophene derivatives having 5-hydroxyl group like the compound (I) and there have been no methods industrially applicable so far.  The existing methods involve various complicated processes and are inefficient and of low yield.  For example, there have been methods wherein 5-acetoxybenzo [b] thiophene is brominated to yield 3-bromo-5-acetoxybenzo [b] thiophene, which in turn is re-protected at the 5-acetoxy group with a benzyl group to yield 3-bromo-5-benzyloxybenzo [b] thiophene, which is followed by metallization with magnesium, introduction of carbon dioxide and removal of the benzyl group (J. Chem. Soc. (C). 1967, 1899-1905); or 5-bromobenzo[b]-thiophene is subjected to Friedel-Crafts reaction to yield 3-acetyl-5-bromobenzo [b] thiophene, which is followed by oxidation with sodium hypochlorite to yield 5-bromobenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylic acid (Nippon-Kagaku Zasshi vol. 86, No. 10, 1067-1072(1965), J. Chem. Soc. (C). 1967, 2084-2089).  5-Hydroxybenzo[b]thiophene-3-carboxylic acid or 5-<br><br>
acetoxybenzo [b] thiophene-3-carboxylic acid are then synthesized starting from the reaction products above. However, the starting material such as 5-hydroxybenzo [b]-thiophene or 5-bromobenzo[b]thiophene is not commercially available and had to be synthesized from an appropriate reagent (e.g., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 57, 1611(1935), J. Heterocyclic Chem., 25, 1271(1988)) in all cases, which have made the synthetic process longer and complex.<br>
The present invention solves the problems of the existing methods and provides a method for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (I), which method is industrially applicable, efficient and safe.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group, or .a reactive derivative thereof comprising subjecting 4-mercaptophenol to reactions for introduction of a propargyl group and protection of hydroxyl group to yield a compound of the formula (II):<br><br>
wherein R1  is a hydroxy-protecting group; oxidizing the<br><br>
compound (II) to yield a compound of the formula (III):<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydroxy-protecting group; subjecting the compound (III) to thermal rearrangement reaction to yield a compound of the formula (IV):<br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined above; and subjecting the compound (IV) to stepwise oxidation of hydroxymethyl group and<br>
optionally deprotection.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for<br>
preparing a compound of the formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group or a reactive derivative thereof comprising subjecting 5-hydroxybenzo[b] thiophene to a protecting reaction to yield a compound of the formula (VII):<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydroxy-protecting group; reacting the<br><br>
compound (VII) with acetyl halide under the conditions for Friedel-Crafts reaction to yield a compound of the formula (VIII):<br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydroxy-protecting group; and subjecting the compound (VIII) to oxidation of the acetyl group and optionally deprotection.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the preparation of the above-mentioned 5-hydroxybenzo[b]-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid derivative of the general formula (VI) by using a compound of the formula (I)•  Thus, the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula (VI):<br><br>
wherein R is as defined above and X is hydrogen or alkyl, and double bond represents either E- or Z-configuration, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a hydrate thereof, which comprises subjecting a compound of the formula (I) or a reactive derivative thereof to the following reactions:<br>
(1)  reaction with a compound of the formula (V)<br><br><br>
wherein X is hydrogen or alkyl; or<br>
(2)	reaction with a compound of the formula (V):<br><br>
or a salt thereof followed by oxidation and reaction with an ylide under the conditions for Wittig reaction; and<br>
(3)	optionally deprotection.<br>

The fmal compound of the present mvention is represented by the formula (VI) as described above, m which the double bond of the alkenylene side cham (5-<br><br>

The method of the present mvention is described below m more detail.  When a substituent(s) possibly mterfermg the reaction is present, it can be appropriately protected and then deprotected at a desired stage.  Such protection or deprotection can be accomplished by a procedure known m the art.<br><br>
Wherem R and R1 are as defmed above. [Step 1]<br>
This step is related to the mtroduction of a propargyl group at the mercapto group of 4-mercaptophenol (1) and protection of hydroxyl group.<br>
The mtroduction of a propargyl group is accomplished<br><br>
by usmg propargyl halide such as propargyl bromide, propargyl chloride and the like m the presence of a basic agents.  The reaction can be accomplished withm several tens mmutes to several hours at room temperature by employmg, as a basic agent, morganic base such as potassmm carbonate, sodmm carbonate or the like, or an organic base such as triethylamme, pyridme, 4-dimethylammopyridme or the like m a solvent such as acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or the like.<br>
When a strong base such as potassmm hydroxide or sodmm hydroxide is used, it can be also accomplished m a two-layer solvent system such as toluene-water or xylene-water.<br>
The protection of hydroxyl group may be conducted usmg an ordmary hydroxy-protectmg group m a conventional manner.  Preferred protectmg groups to be used m the present method are those which do not undergo changes durmg the oxidative reactions m the 2nd and 4th steps of the present Process and the 2nd step of Process IV below for the preparation of compound of the formula (VI) and also durmg the Wittig reaction of the 3rd step of said Process, and can be easily deprotected m the 4th step to give leavmg groups which are easily separable from, for example. Compound A for purification thereof, which corresponds to a compound of the formula (VI) wherem OR is 5-hydroxy, X is hydrogen and double bond is m Z-configuration.  Examples of such a hydroxy-protectmg group<br><br>
mclude alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, acyl, aralkyl, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl/ alkyl-substituted silyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, aralkyloxycarbonyl or tetrahydropyranyl.<br>
Considermg the requirements that a protectmg group should survive durmg the Wittig reaction conducted under strong basic conditions, be easily deprotected, for example, m the 4th step for the preparation of Compound A, and be separable from Compound A, arylsulfonyl is more preferred and benzenesulfonyl is particularly preferred. Benzenesulfonyl group is relatively stable to base m anhydrous solvents and, upon deprotection, gives benzenesulfonic acid which is water-soluble and is easily separated from the from product of the formula (VI)•  The protection and deprotection can be carried out by a method known m the art.  For example, m the case of benzenesulfonyl group, the mtroduction of benzenesulfonyl group is carried out m a manner similar to that for the mtroduction of propargyl group by using benzenesulfonyl chloride. [Step 2]<br>
This step is related to oxidation of the compound (II), There have been known oxidizmg methods which use, for mstance, aqueous hydrogen peroxide - acetic acid (J. Am, Chem, Soc, 87, 1109-1114 (1965)),aqueous hydrogen peroxide - titanmm(III) chloride (Synthesis 1981, 204-206), m-chloroperbenzoic acid (Org. Synth., 64, 157-163 (1985)), or sodmm metaperiodate (J. Org. Chem., 27, 282-284 (1962)). m the present step, it is preferred to use a slightly<br><br>
excess amount of 30 % aqueous hydrogen peroxide m an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol or tert-butanol solution contammg formic acid.  The reaction is accomplished withm several tens mmutes to several hours under coolmg or at room temperature. [Step 3]<br>
This step is related to the conversion of the compound<br>
(III)	mto the hydroxymethyl compound (IV) by thermal<br>
rearrangement reaction.  The thermal rearrangement reaction<br>
m this step is carried out accordmg to the method<br>
described m J. C, S. Chem. Comm,, 1974, 848-849.  Examples<br>
of preferred solvents for this reaction mclude dioxane,<br>
1,2-dimethoxyethane, propyl acetate and 3-pentanone.  The reaction is accomplished by refluxmg m a solvent for several hours followed by addmg to the resultant mtermediate an acid (p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, etc) [Step 4]<br>
This step is related to the oxidation of the compound<br>
(IV)	to provide carboxylic acid (I).  The oxidation can be<br>
carried out either directly or m a stepwise manner.<br>
Examples of oxidizmg agent for convertmg an aromatic<br>
primary alcohol to the correspondmg carboxylic acid<br>
directly mclude chromic acids (Synthesis. 1986, 285-288),<br>
potassmm permanganate (J. Org, Chem., 18, 806-809 (1953))<br>
and ruthenmm oxides (J, C, S, Chem, Comm,, 1979, 58-59)),<br>
However, these methods have disadvantages m not only the<br>
yield but also the followmg matters.  For mstance, the<br><br>
reaction time is long, the detoxification treatment of oxidizmg agent is needed followmg the reaction, the reagents are unstable and/or they mvolve complicated operations.<br>
On the contrary, m some cases, a stepwise oxidation wherem a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde and then to a carboxylic acid may be of advantage with regard to yield.  m general, the oxidation of alcohol to aldehyde has been carried out by usmg an oxidizmg agent of chromic acid series, for example, Jones reagents (J. Org. Chem., 40, 1664^1665 . (1975)), Collms reagents (J. C. S. Chem, Comm., 1972 1126)), pyridmmm chlorochromate (Tetrahedron Lett., 2647-2650 (1975)).  It has been also known a method which uses manganese dioxide (Helv. Chim. Acta., 39, 858-862 (1956)) or dimethyl sulfoxide (Swern oxidation, J. Org, Chem., 43, 2480-2482 (1978)),  However, these existmg methods have disadvantages.  For example, chromic acids are toxic to human body and must be detoxified after use. Further, the Swern oxidation usmg dimethyl sulfoxide-oxalyl chloride is not suited for a large scale production because it is accompanied by the generation of carbon monoxide harmful to workers and sulfurous odor and also it must be carried out at low temperature, for example,<br>
between -50°C and -7 8°C.<br>
Alcohol (IV) can be converted mto aldehyde (IV) almost quantitatively by a method wherem an alcohol (IV) is oxidized with an oxidizmg reagent such as halo oxoacid m the presence of 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidme-l-oxyl<br><br>
or the like (referred to as ""TEMPOS") accordmg to the description m a literature (e.g., J. Org. Chem., 52, 2559-2562 (1987)), whereby the problems of the existmg methods are solved.  Examples of TEMPOS usable mclude 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidme-l-oxyl, 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidme*-l-oxyl, 4-acetylammo-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidme-1-oxyl, 4-benzoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidme-1-oxyl, and 4-cyano-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidme-1-oxyl.  Examples of usable halo oxoacids mclude sodmm hypochlorite, sodmm hypobromite, sodmm bromite and higher bleachmg powder.  A solution of an oxidizmg agent may be adjusted to, for example, pH 8.5 to 9.5 with a mmeral acid such as sodmm hydrogen carbonate, hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid. Alternatively, a solution of an oxidizmg agent may be added m the presence of sodmm hydrogen carbonate.  The reaction can be accomplished withm several mmutes to several tens mmutes at temperature from ice-coolmg to room temperature m a solvent such as ethyl acetate, acetonitrile or dichloromethane.<br>
When the reaction solution contammg the resultant aldehyde (TV) is acidified and sodmm chlorite and aqueous hydrogen peroxide are added thereto, the aldehyde is converted mto carboxylic acid under ice-coolmg withm several tens mmutes to several hours.<br>
If desired, the product may be further subjected to the deprotection of 5-hydroxy-protectmg group and/or conversion mto reactive derivatives at 3-carboxyl group.<br><br>
Such "^ reactive derivative" mcludes the correspondmg acid halides (e.g., chloride, bromide/ iodide), acid anhydrides (e.g., mixed acid anhydride with formic acid or acetic acid), activated esters (e.g., succmimide ester), and the like, and mcludes acylatmg agents generally used for the acylation of ammo group.  For example, to obtam acid halides, a carboxylic acid is reacted with thionyl halide (e.g., thionyl chloride), phosphorous halide (e.g., phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentachloride), oxalyl halide (e.g., oxalyl chloride), or the like, accordmg to a known method (e.g., Shm-jikken Kagaku Koza, vol. 14, p. 1787 (1978); Synthesis 852-854(1986); Shm-jikken Kagaku Koza vol. 22, p. 115 (1992)).<br><br>
wherem R and R1 are as defmed above-[Step 1]<br>
This step is related to the protection of 5-hydroxy group of compound (7).<br>
The compound (7) as the startmg material of the<br><br>
present step is known m a literature (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 57, 1611-1616 (1935), Ann. Chem., 527, 83-114 (1938), J. Am. Chem. Soc, 78, 5351-5357 (1956), J. Org. Chem., 41, 1118-1124 (1976)).  The hydroxyl group of this compound is protected appropriately m a manner similar to that descried m the 1st step of Process I above.  For example, when benzenesulfonyl group is used, the compound is added to benzenesulfonyl chloride m the presence of an morganic base such as sodmm carbonate or potassmm carbonate, or an organic base such as triethylamme or tripropylamme. Example of preferred solvent mcludes acetone, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran.   The reaction is accomplished withm several mmutes to several hours at temperature from room temperature to the boilmg pomt of the solvent.  The compound (VII) can be also synthesized by a broadly used method, commonly known as "Schotten-Baumann reaction". [Step 2]<br>
This step is related to the mtroduction of acetyl group to the 3-position of the compound (VII) by Friedel-Crafts reaction.  The mtroduction of acetyl group is, for example, carried out usmg acetyl chloride or acetyl bromide m the presence of a catalyst, for example, a Lewis acid such as alummmm chloride, ferric chloride, zmc chloride, tm chloride and boron trifluoride.  Example of usable solvent mcludes carbon disulfide, nitrobenzene or a halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or ethylene chloride.

This step is related to the conversion of the compound (VIII) mto a carboxylic acid (I) or a reactive derivative thereof through the oxidation of the acetyl group m the presence of a salt of hypohalous acid.  Examples of preferred hypohalogenite mclude alkali metal or alkalme earth metal salts of hypohalous acids, and potassmm, sodmm or calcmm salt of hypochlorous or hypobromous acid is especially preferred.<br>
m an aqueous solution of such a salt, the oxidation progresses at relatively low temperature.

The compound (V). used m the present process is obtamable accordmg to the method described m Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 6-23170 (23170/1994).<br>
The reaction can be carried out under ordmary conditions for acylation of ammo group.   For example, when a carboxylic acid halide is used, the reaction is carried out accordmg to a method commonly known as "Schotten-Baumann reaction".  m general, carboxylic acid halide is added dropwise to an aqueous alkalme solution of amme with stirrmg and under coolmg while removmg the generatmg acid with alkali.  Alternatively, when a carboxylic acid is used as a free acid not a reactive derivative, the reaction can be conducted conventionally m the presence of a couplmg agent generally used m the couplmg reaction between an amme and a carboxylic acid such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylammopropyl) carbodiimide or W,N'-carbonyldiimidazole.<br><br><br><br>
