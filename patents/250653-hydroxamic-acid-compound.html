This application claims benefit of priority to the following US Provisional Patent Applications, serial no. 60/438,523, filed January 8,2003; serial no. 60/466,974, filed April 30,2003; and serial no. <br><br>
60/520,211 filed November 13,2003; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for any purpose.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention pertains generally to treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. More specifically, the invention described herein pertains to treating gram-negative infections by inhibiting activityof UDP-3-0- (R-3-hydroxydecanoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC). The present invention provides small molecule inhibitors of LpxC, pharmaceutical formulations containing such inhibitors, methods of treating patients with such pharmaceutical formulations, and to methods of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations and inhibitors. The inhibitors can be used to treat Gram- negative infections of patients alone and in combination with other antibacterials.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Over the past several decades, the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and its association with serious infectious diseases have increased at alarming rates. The increasing prevalence of resistance among nosocomial pathogens is particularly disconcerting. Of the over 2 million nosocomial infections occurring each year in the United States, 50 to 60% are caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria. This high rate of resistance increases the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with nosocomial infections. In the United States, nosocomial infections are thought to contribute to or cause more than 77,000 deaths per year and cost approximately $5 to $10 billion annually. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin-(oxacillin-) resistant <br>
Staphylococcus aureus,B-lactam-resistant andmultidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin- resistantenterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrumB- lactamases(ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C)B-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and <br>
Citrobacter freundii, andmultidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, <br><br>
Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. (Jones RN 2001 Chest 119 (supplement), 397S-404S : Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: Trends over the past few years.) <br>
The problem of antibacterial resistance is compounded by the existence of bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibacterials. For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones are virtually all resistant to additional antibacterials (SahmDF et al 2001 <br>
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 45,267-274 : Evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.) <br>
Thus there is a need for new antibacterials, particularly antibacterials with novel mechanisms of action. Most of the antibacterial discovery effort in the pharmaceutical industry is aimed at development of drugs effective against gram-positive bacteria. However, there is also a need for new gram-negative antibacterials. Gram-negative bacteria are in general more resistant to a large number of antibacterials and chemotherapeutic agents than are gram-positive bacteria. A survey of recently reported antibacterials of natural origin showed that over 90% lacked activity against Escherichia coli, although they were active against gram-positive bacteria. The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contributes to this intrinsic resistance by acting as an efficient permeability barrier, because the narrow porin channels limit the penetration of hydrophilic solutes and the low fluidity of the lipopolysaccharide leaflet slows down the inward diffusion of lipophilic solutes. A second mechanism contributes to the intrinsic resistance of gram-negative bacteria. Recent studies showed that multiple drug efflux pumps, sometimes with unusually broad specificity, act as this second factor to create the general intrinsic resistance of gram-negative bacteria. When their expression levels are elevated as a consequence of physiological regulation or genetic alteration, they can frequently produce impressive levels of resistance to a wide variety of antimicrobial agents. (Nikaido H 1998 Clinical Infectious <br>
Diseases 27 (Suppl 1), S32-41: Antibacterial resistance caused by gram-negativemultidrug efflux pumps.) <br>
Historically, most development of antimicrobial agents has been relatively empirical. Active compounds have generally been found via screening soil, sewage, water, and other natural substances to detect antimicrobial-producing organisms, or by screening various chemical compounds. Once a leading candidate has been found and its chemical structure determined, a series of analogs is made to identify an optimal compound for further clinical development. A more rational approach involves the defining of new targets, such as genes or enzymatic functions, responsible for a crucial cellular <br><br>
essential activity. Once this has been done, inhibitors or blockers of the function or gene product can be developed. <br><br>
In order to identify potential targets for novel gram-negative antibacterial agents, studies aimed at identifying all essential and important genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been performed. <br><br>
Among the essential genes identified was lpxC, that encodes the enzymeuridyldiphospho-3-0- (R- hydroxydecanoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC). This enzyme is the first committed step in the synthesis of lipid A, the lipid moiety of lipopolysaccharide, that is an essential component of all gram-negative bacteria. It therefore is an attractive target for novel antibacterials. In order to be useful as antibacterial agents, LpxC inhibitors would not only have to inhibit the enzymatic activity of LpxC from a variety of bacteria, but would have to defeat the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of gram- negative bacteria, as described above: they would have to penetrate the outer membrane and be relatively unsusceptible tomultidrug efflux pumps. <br><br>
Researchers have identified a few compounds with antibacterial activity that target lipid A biosynthesis. WO 97/42179 to Patchett et al. discloses compounds of the formula: <br>
EMI3.1<br><br>
The compounds possess activity against certain gram-negative organisms, for example Escherichia coli, but are not active against other medically important gram-negative bacteria, for example Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequent studies have found that the primary reason for their inactivity against particular, medically important gram-negative bacteria is their poor ability to inhibit P. aeruginosa LpxC; efflux by the major multidrug efflux pump or inability to penetrate the outer membrane were not the critical factors. <br><br>
Jackman et al. , in J. Biol. Chem. (vol. 275, no. 15, April 14,2000,pps. 11002-11009), discuss the mechanism of lipid A biosynthesis in the context of gram-negative bacteria and discloses a newclass ofhydroxamate-containing inhibitors of LpxC. Wyckoff et al. , in Trends in Microbiology(vol. <br><br>
6, no. 4, April1998, pps. 154-159), discuss the role of LpxC in lipid A biosynthesis and its role in <br><br>
regulation.Wyckoff et al. disclose a few oxazoline hydroxamic acids that inhibit bacterial growth. <br><br>
However, Wyckoff et al. also discuss the shortcomings of the available deacetylase inhibitors as bactericidal agents against Pseudomonas and that more work is needed to be done in the area. <br><br>
Thus, an increasing need exists for LpxC inhibitors that have activity as bactericidal agents against gram-negative bacteria. It is, accordingly, an object, of this invention to provide compounds and combinations of such compounds for use in the preparation of antibacterials and other pharmaceuticals capable of inhibiting Gram-negative bacterial infections. <br><br>

The term"antibacterialagent"refers to agents synthesized or modified in the laboratory that have either bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity. An"active"agent in this context will inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria. The term"inhibiting thegrowth"indicates that the rate of increase in the numbers of a population of a particular bacterium is reduced. Thus, the term includes situations in which the bacterial population increases but at a reduced rate, as well as situations where the growth of the population is stopped, as well as situations where the numbers of the bacteria in the population are reduced or the population even eliminated. If an enzyme activity assay is used to screen for inhibitors, one can make modifications in uptake/efflux, solubility, half-life, etc. to compounds in order to correlate enzyme inhibition with growth inhibition. The activity of antibacterial agents is not necessarily limited to bacteria but may also encompass activity against parasites, virus, and fungi. <br><br>
The subject invention also includes isotopically-labeled LpxC inhibitors, that are structurally identical to those disclosed above, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds and of said prodrugs that contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and14C are incorporated, are useful in drugand/or <br><br>
substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i. e.,3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i. e.,2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out known or referenced procedures and by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for anon-isotopically labeled reagent. <br><br>
The present invention provides novel compounds, pharmaceutical formulations including the compounds, methods of inhibitingUDP-3-0-(R-3-hydroxydecanoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (LpxC), and methods of treating gram-negative bacterial infections. <br><br>

Pharmaceutical Compositions <br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise atherapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" <br><br>
means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials that can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch ; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate ; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water ; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non- toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally,intracisternally,intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray, or a liquid aerosol or dry powder formulation for inhalation. <br><br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. <br><br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3- butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U. S. P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can <br><br>
be employed including synthetic mono-ordiglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. <br><br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial- retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. <br><br>
In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorptionof a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by formingmicroencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such aspolylactide- polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations may also be prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. <br><br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories that can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. <br><br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate ordicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicicacid ; b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia,<br><br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. <br><br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. <br><br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient (s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. <br><br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. <br><br>
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e. g., tableting lubricants and othertableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient (s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. <br><br>
Dosage forms for topical ortransdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, ear drops, and the like are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. <br><br>
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. <br><br>
Compositions of the invention may also be formulated for delivery as a liquid aerosol or inhalable dry powder. Liquid aerosol formulations may be nebulized predominantly into particle sizes that can be delivered to the terminal and respiratory bronchioles where bacteria reside in patients with bronchial infections, such as chronic bronchitis and pneumonia. Pathogenic bacteria are commonly present throughout airways down to bronchi, bronchioli and lung parenchema, particularly in terminal and respiratory bronchioles. During exacerbation of infection, bacteria can also be present in alveoli. <br><br>
Liquid aerosol and inhalable dry powder formulations are preferably delivered throughout the endobronchial tree to the terminal bronchioles and eventually to the parenchymal tissue. <br><br>
Aerosolized formulations of the invention may be delivered using an aerosol forming device, such as a jet, vibrating porous plate or ultrasonic nebulizer, preferably selected to allow the formation of a aerosol particles having with a mass medium average diameter predominantly between 1 to5 pm. <br><br>
Further, the formulation preferably has balanced osmolarity ionic strength and chloride concentration, and the smallest aerosolizable volume able to deliver effective dose of the compounds of the invention to the site of the infection. Additionally, the aerosolized formulation preferably does not impair negatively the functionality of the airways and does not cause undesirable side effects. <br><br>
Aerosolization devices suitable for administration of aerosol formulations of the invention include, for example, jet, vibrating porous plate, ultrasonic nebulizers and energized dry powder inhalers, that are able to nebulize the formulation of the invention into aerosol particle size predominantly in the size range from1-5 um. Predominantly in this application means that at least 70% but preferably more than 90% of all generated aerosol particles are 1 to 5 pm range. A jet nebulizer works by air pressure to break a liquid solution into aerosol droplets. Vibrating porous plate nebulizers work by using a sonic vacuum produced by a rapidly vibrating porous plate to extrude a solvent droplet through a porous plate. An ultrasonic nebulizer works by a piezoelectric crystal that shears a liquid into small aerosol droplets. A variety of suitable devices are available, including, for example, AeroNeb and AeroDose vibrating porous plate nebulizers (AeroGen,Inc., Sunnyvale, California), Sidestream7 nebulizers (Medic-Aid Ltd. , West Sussex, England), Pari LC7 and Pari LC Star7 jet nebulizers (Pari Respiratory Equipment,Inc., Richmond, Virginia), and Aerosonic (DeVilbiss <br><br>
Medizinische Produkte (Deutschland) GmbH, Heiden, Germany) andUltraAire7 (OmronHealthcare,Inc., Vernon Hills, Illinois) ultrasonic nebulizers. <br><br>
Compounds of the invention may also be formulated for use as topical powders and sprays that can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. <br><br>
Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons. <br><br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. <br><br>
The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. <br><br>
According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, bacterial infections are treated or prevented in a patient such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount ofa compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result.By a"therapeutically effective amount"of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat bacterial infections, at a reasonablebenefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed ; and like factors well known in the medical arts. <br><br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other mammal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 2000 mg of the compound (s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses. <br><br>
Methods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, inRemington : The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.,19th <br>
Edition(1995). Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present invention can be in the form of sterile, non-pyrogenic liquid solutions or suspensions, coated capsules, suppositories, lyophilized powders, transdermal patches or other forms known in the art. <br><br>
A"kit"as used in the instant application includes a container for containing the pharmaceutical compositions and may also include divided containers such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. <br><br>
The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art that is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a resealable bag (for example, to hold a"refill"of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. <br><br>
The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle that is in turn contained within a box. <br><br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of individual tablets or capsules to be packed or may have the size and shape to accommodate multiple tabletsand/or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses accordingly and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil that is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are individually sealed or collectively sealed, as desired, in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening. <br><br>
It maybe desirable to provide a written memory aid, where the written memory aid is of the type containing information and/or instructions for the physician, pharmacist or other health care provider, or subject, e. g. , in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen that the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested or <br><br>
a card that contains the same type of information. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e. g. , as follows"First Week, Monday, Tuesday,"... etc..."Second Week, Monday,Tuesday,..."etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A"dailydose"can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day. When the kit contains separate compositions, a daily dose of one or more compositions of the kit can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of another one or more compositions of the kit can consist of several tablets or capsules. <br><br>
Another specific embodiment of a kit is a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter, that indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal that, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been takenand/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken. <br><br>
The kits of the present invention may also include, in addition to LpxC inhibitors, one or more additional pharmaceutically active compounds. Preferably, the additional compound is another LpxC inhibitor or another compound useful to bacterial infections. The additional compounds may be administered in the same dosage form as the LpxC inhibitor or in different dosage forms. Likewise, the additional compounds can be administered at the same time as the LpxC inhibitor or at different times. <br><br>
Compositions of the present compounds may also be used in combination with other known antibacterial agents of similar spectrum to (1) synergistically enhance treatment of severe Gram- negative infections covered by the spectrum of this compound or (2) add coverage in severe infections in which multiple organisms are suspected in which another agent of a different spectrum may be required in addition to this compound. Potential agents include members of the aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, glycopeptides, lipopeptides andoxazolidinones. The treatment can involve administering a composition having both active agents or administration of the inventive compounds followed by or preceded by administration of an additional active antibacterial agent. <br><br>
Characterization and Purification Methods <br>
Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography <br><br>
system with a 2690 Separation Module(Milford, Massachusetts). The analytical columns were AlltimaC-18 reversed phase, 4.6 x 250 mm from Alltech (Deerfield, Illinois). A gradient elution was used, typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressingto 100% acetonitrile over a period of 40 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed with a Varian 300 Mhz NMR(Palo Alto, California). The spectral reference was either TMS or the known chemical shift of the solvent. Some compound samples were run at elevated temperatures (e. g.75 C) to promote increased sample solubility. <br><br>
The purity of some of the invention compounds was assessed by elemental analysis (Desert Analytics, Tuscon, Arizona) Tuscon, Arizona) <br>
Melting points were determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp apparatus (Holliston, Massachusetts). <br><br>
Preparative separations were carried out using a Flash 40 chromatography system and KP-Sil, <br>
60A(Biotage, Charlottesville, Virginia), or by flash column chromatography using silica gel (230-400 mesh) packing material, or by HPLC using a C-18 reversed phase column. Typical solvents employed for the Flash 40 Biotage system and flash column chromatography were dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate, hexane, acetone, aqueous hydroxyamine and triethyl amine. Typical solvents employed for the reverse phase HPLC were varying concentrations of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. <br><br>

Biological protocols and dataP. aeruginosa LpxC Inhibition Assay <br>
The assay followed the general method of Hyland et al (Journal of Bacteriology 1997 179, <br>
2029-2037: Cloning, expression and purificationof UDP-3-O-acyl-GlcNAc deacetylase from <br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa : a metalloamidase of the lipidA biosynthesis pathway) and the radiolabeling procedure is according to Kline et al. supra. Briefly, samples were incubated with 2 nM P. aeruginosa <br>
LpxC and 150 nM[3H-Ac]-UDP-3-0-(R-3-hydroxydecanoyl)-GlcNAc in a total volume of 50 uL for <br>
90 min at room temperature. Reactions were carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mg/mL BSA. Reactions were stopped by the addition of <br>
180 uL of a 3% suspension of activated charcoal powder in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.5. <br><br>
Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation. A portion of the clarified supernatant, containing the enzymatically released [3H] -acetate, was transferred to opaque white 96-well plates containing scintillation fluid. The radioactivity was measured in a Perkin-Elmer/WallacTrilux Microbeta counter. <br><br>
Control reactions to which 5 mM EDTA had been added were included with each run to determine nonspecific tritium release. <br><br>
Bacterial Screens and Cultures <br>
Bacterial isolates were cultivatedfrom-70 C frozen stocks by two consecutive overnight passages at35 C in ambient air on 5% blood agar(Remel, Lenexa, KS). Clinical isolates tested were from a collection composed of isolates collected during clinical trials and recent clinical isolates obtained from various geographically diverse hospitals in the US. Quality control and primary panel strains were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville, MD), with the exception of P. aeruginosa PA0200, a strain with a deletion of the mexABoprM genes that was received from <br>
Dr. H. Schweizer. This strain does not express the principalmultidrug efflux pump and is hypersusceptible to many antibacterials. Strain Z61 (ATCC 35151) is also hypersusceptible to antibacterials. It is thought that thehypersusceptibility of this strain is the result of increased permeability of its outer membrane (Angus BL et al, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1982 <br>
21,299-309 : Outer membrane permeability in Pseudomonas aeruginosa : Comparison of a wild-type with anantibacterial-supersusceptible mutant). <br><br>
Susceptibility Testing <br>
Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations(MICs) were determined by the broth microdilution method in accordance with the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines. In brief, organism suspensions were are adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard to yield a finalinoculum between3x105 and7x105 colony-forming units(CFU)/mL. Drug dilutions and inocula were made in sterile, cation adjustedMueller-Hinton Broth (Remel). An inoculum volume of100 was added to wells containing 1001 of broth with 2-fold serial dilutions of drug. All inoculated microdilution trays were incubated in ambient air at35 C for 18-24 hours. Following incubation, the lowest concentration of the drug that prevented visible growth was recorded as the MIC. Performance of the assay was monitored by the use of laboratory quality-control strains againsttobramycin, that has a defined MIC spectrum, in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. <br><br>
Efficacy in mouse model of systemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection <br>
Female Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of a bacterial suspension containing approximately 100 times the dose that would kill 50% of animals(LDso) of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 or E. coli ATCC 25922. At one and five hours post infection, the test compound was injected intravenously in doses ranging from 5mg/kg to 100mg/kg, five mice per group. Mice were observed for 5 days, and the dose of compound resulting in survival of50% of mice(EDso) was calculated. <br><br>
Drug Combination (Synergy) StudiesI. Principle <br>
Checkerboard experiments can be performed to assess potential interactions between primary drug of interest(&amp;num;1) and other related antibacterials (&amp;num;2). P.aerugi71osa ATCC 27853, S. aureus ATCC 29213 and other organisms can be used as challenge strains as well as selected clinical isolates. Brothmicrodilution format can be used to assess the activity of drug &amp;num;1 and test compound alone and in combination. Two-fold dilutions of the two compounds to be tested (each bracketing the expected MIC value) are used. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) was calculated as the MIC of compound &amp;num;1 in combination with a second compound, divided by the MIC of compound &amp;num;1 alone. A summation FIC (EFIC) was computed for each drug combination as the sum of the individual FICs of compound &amp;num;1 and &amp;num;2. Synergy was defined as anzFICzu 0.5, indifference as anEFIC between 0.5 and <br><br>
4, and antagonism as EPIC &gt; 4. The lowest EFIC was used for the final interpretation of drug combination studies., Interpretation of summation (EFIC) a) Synergism, x#0. 5 b) Indifference, 0.5  4 Table 2: Demonstration of Antibacterial activity of Select Compounds from Table 1 Enzyme inhibitory activity <br>
