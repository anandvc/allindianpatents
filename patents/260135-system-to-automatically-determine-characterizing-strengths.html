				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates to systems and methods for computer based text retrieval, and more particularly, to systems and method enabling the retrieval of those texts from databases that are deemed to be related to a search query.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The number of electronic documents that are published today is ever increasing. For one to search for information has become difficult. Search engines typically deliver more results than a user can cope with, since it is impossible to read through all the documents found to be relevant by the search engine. It is of great help to present the search result in a condensed way, or to present only those documents that are likely to contain interesting information.<br>
Schemes are known where a keyword collector is employed. These schemes take into account things like boldness of a word, and location in a document (i.e., words at the top are given more weight). One may use the statistical appearances of words, word-pairs and noun phrases in a document to calculate statistical weights (scores). To compute the content of a document, one may use a simple keyword frequency measure known as TFIDF (term frequency times inverse document frequency). This well-known technique is based on the observation that keywords that are relatively common in a document, but relatively rare in general are good indicators of the document's content. This heuristic is not very reliable, but is quick to compute.<br>
There are approaches where a precision is determined in order to allow a better presentation of the results of a search. The precision is defined as the number of relevant documents retrieved by the search, divided by the total number of documents retrieved. Usually, another parameter, called recall, is determined, too.<br>
There are more sophisticated techniques. Examples are those approaches where users rate pages explicitly. Systems are able to automatically mark those links that seem promising.<br>
Other sophisticated techniques watch the user (e.g., by recording his preferences) in order to be able to make a distinction between information that is not of interest to the user and information that is more likely to be of interest.<br>
Goldman et al. describe in their article "Proximity Search in Databases", in Proceedings of the 24th VLDB Conference, New York, USA, 1998, pages 26-37, XP002237315, ISBN: 1-55860-566-5, an information retrieval (IR) engine that can rank documents based on textual proximity of key-words within each document. This notion is applied to search across an entire database for objects that are "near" other relevant objects. Proximity search enables simple "focusing" queries based on general relationships among objects, helpful for interactive query sessions. The database is seen as a graph, with data in vertices (objects)<br><br>
and relationships indicated by edges. Proximity is defined based on shortest paths between objects. A prototype search engine was implemented that uses this model to enable keyword searches over databases, and it was found very effective for quickly finding relevant information. Computing the distance between objects in a graph stored on disk can be very expensive. Hence, it is shown how to build compact indexes that allow one to quickly find the distance between objects at search time. The proximity search architecture includes a definition of a query with a query word, a creation of a graph with nodes and links, a determination of a neighborhood of the query word, and a computation of object distances.<br>
US Patent 6,167,370 relates to a computer based software system and method for semantically processing a user entered natural language request to identify and store linguistic subject-action-object (SAO) structures. Such structures are used as key words/phrases to search local and web-based databases for downloading candidate natural language documents, semantically processing candidate document texts into candidate document SAO structures, and selecting and storing only relevant documents whose SAOstructures include a match with a stored requestSAOstructure. Further features include analyzing relationships among relevant document SAO structures and creating new SAO structures based on such relationships that may yield new knowledge concepts and ideas for display to the user and generating and displaying natural language summaries based on the relevant document SAO structures.<br>
Despite all these schemes, it is still cumbersome to navigate through the internet, or even through one site of the internet if one tries to find a document or a set of documents containing information of interest.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a scheme that allows a<br>
user to more easily find relevant information in a collection of texts.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a system that helps a user<br>
to locate those texts in a collection of texts, or subsections of texts that<br>
are related to a word, sentence, or text the user is looking for.<br>
In  accordance with  the  present  invention,  there  is now  provided  a<br>
method as claimed in claim 1.<br>
Viewing the present invention from another aspect, there is now provided<br>
a system as claimed in claim 16.<br>
Viewing the present invention from yet another aspect, there is now<br>
provided a software module as claimed in claim 24.<br>
The inventive scheme helps to realize systems where a user is able to find<br>
those documents actually containing information of interest and is thus<br>
less likely to follow "wrong" links and reach useless documents. The<br>
systems presented herein attempt to provide  suggestions of relevant<br>
documents, only.<br><br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an information<br>
retrieval  system,   method,   and  various   software  modules  provide  an<br>
improved information retrieval from a document database by providing a<br>
special     ranking    of    documents     taking    into     consideration     the<br>
characterizing strength of each document.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it is possible to realize search<br>
engines, search agents, and web services that are able to understand the<br>
users' intentions and needs.<br>
The present invention can be used for information retrieval in general<br>
and for searching and recalling information, in particular.<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention that those documents in a<br>
document database are offered for retrieval that accurately satisfy the<br>
user's query.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:<br>
The characterizing strength C of a document is an abstract measure of<br>
how well this document satisfies the user's information needs. Ideally, a<br>
system   should   retrieve   only   the   relevant   documents   for   a   user.<br>
Unfortunately, this is a subjective notion and difficult to quantify. In the<br>
present context, the characterizing strength C is a reliable measure for a<br>
document's   relevance   that   can   be   automatically   and   reproducibly<br>
determined.<br>
A text is a piece of information the user may want to retrieve. This could<br>
be a text file,  a www-page,  a newsgroup posting,  a document,  or a<br>
sentence from a book and the like. The texts can be stored within the<br>
user's computer system, or in a server system. The texts can also be<br>
stored in a distributed environment, e.g., somewhere in the Internet.<br>
In order for a user to be able to find the desired information, it would be<br>
desirable   for   a   collection   of  electronic   texts   (e.g.,   an   appropriate<br>
database) to be available. An interface is required that allows the user to<br>
pose a question or define a search query. Standard interfaces can be<br>
used for this purpose.<br>
A query is a word or a string of words that characterizes the information<br>
that the user seeks. Note that a query does not have to be a human<br>
readable query.<br>
A first implementation of the present invention is now described in<br>
connection with an example. Details are illustrated in Figure 1. There is<br>
a database  10 comprising a collection of m texts  17. In the present<br>
example, the user is looking for information concerning the word "agent".<br><br>
In order to do so, he creates a query 15 that simply contains the word "agent". He can create this query using a search interface (e.g., within a browser) provided on a computer screen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a search engine 16 is employed that is able to find all texts 17 in the database 10 that contain the word "agent". A conventional search engine can be used for that purpose. The search engine 16 can be located inside the user's computer or at a server. There are three texts 11, 12, and 13 (k = 3) that contain the word "agent", as illustrated in box 14. In an additional sequence of steps, the characterizing strength C of each text is determined in order to find the text or texts that are most relevant. For this purpose, a calculating engine 18 is employed. The calculating engine 18 may output the results in a format displayed in box 19. In this output box 19 a characterizing strength Cl is given for each of the three texts 11 - 13. The sequence of steps that is carried out by the calculating engine 18 is illustrated as flow chart in Figure 2. The following sequence of steps is carried out for each text 11-13 that was identified as containing the word "agent".<br>
In a first step 20, one text (e.g., text 11) is fetched. Then (step 21), a virtual network (herein referred to as graph) is created that indicates the relationship between the words of the text, e.g., the relationship between the word "agent" and the other words of the text. The words of the text are represented by network elements (nodes) and the relationship between words is represented by links (edges). If two words are connected through one link, then there is assumed to be a close relationship between these two words. If two words are more than one link apart, then there is no close relationship. A parser can be employed in order to generate such a network. An English slot grammar (ESG) parser is well suited. Alternatively, one can employ a self-organizing graph generated by a network generator, as described in connection with another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In a subsequent step 22, the graph is evolved. The graph can be evolved by reducing its complexity, for example. This can be done by removing certain words and links and/or by replacing certain words. During this step, the whole graph may also be re-arranged. This is done according to a pre-defined set of rules.<br>
The characterizing strength (C) will now be calculated based on a topological structure of the neighborhood. The number of immediate neighbors of the word "agent" is determined (step 23). An immediate neighbor is a neighbor that is connected through one link to the word "agent". The number of immediate neighbors is determined by counting the number of neighbors (first neighbors) that are connected through one link to the word "agent". In that one counts the number of immediate neighbors, one is able the determine the topological structure of the<br><br>
graph. There are other ways to determine the topological structure of<br>
graphs, as will be described later.<br>
The characterizing strength Cl of the respective text in now calculated<br>
(step 24) based on the number of immediate neighbors.<br>
After having determined the characterizing strength Cl, the result is<br>
output (step 25) such that it can be used for further processing. The<br>
characterizing strength Cl may for example be picked up by another<br>
application, or it may be processed such that it can be displayed on a<br>
display screen.<br>
Some or all these steps 20 - 25 can now be repeated for all k texts 11-<br>
13 that were identified as containing the word "agent". The repetition of<br>
these steps is schematically illustrated by means of the loop 26.<br>
Text 11 is depicted in table 1.<br>
Table 1: Text 11<br>
I offer a definition of agents we can all probably agree on.<br>
When asked what an agent is, I usually say that just as a word processor<br>
works through the medium of words, and spreadsheets work through<br>
numbers, agents work through the medium of actions.<br>
For example, an agent might remind or automatically prompt me to email<br>
John, find me that article on IBM's new chip, or buy Yahoo stock when it<br>
drops to 80.<br>
In a more technical vein, agents are atomic software entities operating<br>
through autonomous actions on behalf of the user, such as machines<br>
and humans, without constant human intervention.<br>
This text 11 comprises four sentences. Pursuant to step 21, a tree-like<br>
graph 30 is generated for each sentence using an English Slot Grammar<br>
parser. The first sentence graph 30, is illustrated in Figure 3A. The graph<br>
30 comprises nodes (represented by boxes) and links (represented by<br>
lines connecting the boxes). In the present example, the parser creates a<br>
tree-like graph 30 with twelve nodes since the first sentence comprises<br>
twelve words. The word "agent" appears just once in this first sentence.<br>
The main verb "offer" forms the root of the tree-like graph 30.<br>
The second sentence graph 31  is illustrated in Figure 3B. The word<br>
"agent" is used two times in this sentence. The main verb "say" forms the<br>
root of the tree-like graph 31.<br>
The third sentence graph 32 is shown in Figure 3C. The word "agent" is<br>
used just once. The main verb "may" forms the root of the tree-like graph<br>
32.<br>
The fourth sentence graph 33 is depicted in Figure 3D. The word "agent"<br>
appears once. The main verb "be" forms the root of the tree-like graph<br>
33.<br><br>
In a subsequent step 22, the graph is evolved by reducing the complexity of the graphs 30 - 33. This is done - according to a pre-defined set of rules - by removing certain words and links and/or by replacing certain words. In the present example, at least the following three rules are used:<br>
1.	Keep only nouns and verbs,<br>
2.	Replace auxiliary verbs with main verbs, and<br>
3.	Create verb group if verb consists of a sequence.<br>
If one applies these three rules to the graph 30 of Figure 3A, a graph 30'<br>
is  generated  that  comprises  five  nodes 40  -  44.  This  graph  30' is<br>
illustrated in Figure 4A. The following words have been removed from the<br>
network 30: "I", "a",<br>
"of, "can", "we", "all", "probably", "on". As a preparation for evolving the<br>
graph 30' further, one identifies the subject of the first sentence. Since<br>
there is no subject in the first sentence of text 11, an empty subject box<br>
44 is generated.<br>
Applying the same set of rules 1- 3 to the second sentence, a simplified<br>
graph 31' is obtained, as shown in Figure 4B. Since there is no subject in<br>
the second sentence either, an empty subject box 45 is generated.<br>
Using the same approach, a simplified graph 32' is obtained, as shown in<br>
Figure 4C. The word "agent"  46 is identified as subject in the third<br>
sentence. This subject is marked by assigning the identifier SUB to box<br>
46.<br>
The simplified graph 33' is illustrated in Figure 4D. The word "agent" is<br>
the subject 47 of this sentence, too.<br>
The complexity of the graphs 30' - 33' is further reduced according to an<br>
additional pre-defined set of rules. In the present example, the following<br>
additional rules are used:<br>
4.	Leave out verbs, and<br>
5.	Put subject at the root (instead of main verb).<br>
When applying these rules 4. and 5., the graphs 30", 31", 32", and 33" are obtained, as illustrated in Figures 5A - 5D, respectively. The number of immediate neighbors of the word "agent" is now determined for each graph 30", 31", 32", and 33" (step 23). The number of immediate neighbors is depicted in Figures 5A - 5D. The word "agent" 42 has only one immediate neighbor 41 in the graph 30" of the first sentence (cf. Figure 5A). The two words "agent" 48 and 49 have no immediate neighbors in the graph 31" of the second sentence (cf. Figure 5B). Note that the empty subject node 45 does not count as a neighbor. The word "agent" 46 has two immediate neighbors 50 and 51 in the graph 32" of the third sentence (cf. Figure 5C). The word "agent" 47 has two immediate neighbors 52 and 53 in the graph 33" of the fourth sentence (cf. Figure 5D).<br><br>
In an optional step one might also determine the second neighbors, as will be addressed in connection with another embodiment (see Figure 7). For sake of simplicity, the number of second neighbors is also displayed in the Figures 5A - 5D.<br>
The calculation of the characterizing strength C is schematically illustrated in Figure 6. The first column 64 of the table 60 shows the number of immediate neighbors for each of the four sentences of the text 11. The sum of all numbers in a column is given in row 62. The characterizing strength Cl, where only the immediate neighbors of the word "agent" are taken into consideration, is given in row 63. In the present example, the characterizing strength Cl is the average of all results in column 64. In more general terms, the characterizing strength is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
whereby n is the number of sentences in a given text and Csi is the number of immediate neighbors of the ith sentence with i = 1, 2, ..., n. In the present example, the characterizing strength Cl of the text 11 is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Note that other algorithms can be used to determine the characterizing<br>
strength Cl of a text.<br>
An advantageous implementation of the present invention is represented<br>
by the flow chart in Figure 7. Like in the first example, the user is<br>
looking for texts that  describe  the  word  "agent"  well.  The  following<br>
sequence of steps is carried out for each of the k texts 11-13 that were<br>
identified as containing the word "agent". In a first step 70, one text (e.g.,<br>
text 11) is fetched. Then (step 71), a graph is created. A parser (e.g., an<br>
ESG parser) can be employed in order to generate such a graph.<br>
In a subsequent step 72, the graphs 30 - 33 are evolved. This is done<br>
according to a pre-defined set of rules. In the present example, the rules<br>
1. - 5. are used, too. In order to further evolve the graphs 30 - 33, a step<br>
73 is carried out. During this step, the centers of the graphs are defined<br>
by putting the subject in the center (instead of the main verb). In the<br>
tree-like graphs, the root is defined to be the center.<br>
The number of immediate neighbors is determined (step 74) by counting<br>
the number of neighbors (first neighbors) that are connected through one<br>
link to the word "agent".<br>
In an optional step 75, the second neighbors of the word "agent" are<br>
determined,  as well. A second neighbor is a word that is connected<br><br>
through two links to the word "agent".  Note that there is always an<br>
immediate neighbor between the word and any second neighbor.<br>
The characterizing strength C2 of the respective text in now calculated<br>
(step 76) based on the number of immediate neighbors and second<br>
neighbors.<br>
After having determined the characterizing strength C2, the result is<br>
output (step 77) such that it can be used for further processing. Some or<br>
all these steps 70 - 77 can now be repeated for all texts 11-13 that were<br>
identified as containing the word "agent". The repetition of these steps is<br>
schematically illustrated by means of the loop 78.<br>
The   calculation   of  the   characterizing   strength   C2   is   schematically<br>
illustrated in Figure 6. The second column 61 of the table 60 shows the<br>
number of immediate neighbors plus the number of second neighbors for<br>
each of the four sentences of the text 1 1 . The sum of all numbers in a<br>
column is given in row 62. The characterizing strength C2, where the<br>
immediate neighbors and the second neighbors of the word "agent" are<br>
taken into consideration, is given in row 63. In the present example, the<br>
characterizing strength C2 is the average of all results in column 61 . In<br>
more general terms, the characterizing strength is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
whereby n is the number of sentences in a given text and c A si is the number of immediate neighbors plus the number of second neighbors of the nth sentence with i = 1, 2, ..., n. In the present example, the characterizing strength C2 of the text 1 1 is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Note that other algorithms can be used to determine the characterizing strength C2 of a text. The text 12 is displayed in table 2.<br>

This special section is based on a straightforward vision of the Internet evolution.<br>
The Web, in order to avoid being overwhelmed by its own informational baggage, has to grow from a dumb publishing model toward a more refined and intelligent one. This evolution will be based on all sorts of new and open technologies, like distributed objects, the Java programming language, semantic tagging, and the extensible markup language (XML).<br><br>
However, a bit more murky is how agents will fit into the future of the Web.<br>
When following the above-de scribed set of rules and steps according to the first embodiment (see Figure 2), one is able to determine the characterizing strength Cl, as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
C2 can be determined to be:<br>

The Buyer's Agent of Central Ohio is the oldest and largest real estate company working only with buyers of real estate.<br>
We have saved our clients over $54 million nationwide. We do not list<br>
homes for sale. One hundred percent of my time and effort is devoted to<br>
helping my clients find homes. With a thorough knowledge of the<br>
Columbus real estate market, I can show homes listed by any brokerage,<br>
by private owners or by builders and I never represent the sellerl	<br>
When following the above-described set of rules and steps according to the first embodiment (see Figure 2), one is able to determine the characterizing strength Cl, as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
C2 can be determined to be:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
When comparing the results for all three texts 11, 12, and 13, one now can draw the conclusion that the text 11 is most relevant since it has a Cl of 1.25.<br>
If one uses C2 instead of Cl, the result is even more pronounced. The text 11 is clearly the one that characterizes the word "agent" the best. The next best fit is the text 13. The calculation engine 18 (cf. Figure 1) thus is able to provide an output box 19 where all three texts 11, 12, and 13 are ordered according to their characterizing strength Cl. The same<br><br><br>
ranking can be done using the C2 results. The user can now retrieve the respective texts by clicking on one of the http-links in the output box 19. These links are indicated by means of underlining.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a semantic network generator (also called semantic processor) is employed. This semantic network generator creates a graph for each text that is returned by a search engine when processing a search query. Details about a semantic network generator are given in the co-pending patent application EP 962873-A1, currently assigned to the assignee of the present patent application. This co-pending patent application was published on 8 December 1999. The semantic network generator creates a graph that has a fractal hierarchal structure and comprises semantical units and pointers. In accordance with the above-mentioned published EP patent application, the pointers may carry weights, whereby the weights represent the semantical distance between neighboring semantical units.<br>
According to the present invention, such a graph generated by the semantic network generator can be evolved by applying a set of rules. One can, for example, remove all pointers and semantical units that have semantical distances with respect to the word(s) given by a query that is above or below a certain threshold. In other words, only the neighborhood of the word(s) the user has listed in the query is kept in the graph. All other semantical units and pointers are not considered in determining the characterizing strength of the respective text. Some or all of the rules described in connection with the first two embodiments can be employed as well. One can also employ self-organizing graphs to reduce the complexity before determining the characterizing strength (Cl and/or C2). Such self-organizing graphs are described in the co-pending patent application PCT/IB99/00231, as filed on 11 February 1999 and in the copending German patent application with application number DE, 19908204.9, as filed on 25 February 1999. Yet another embodiment is described in connection with Figures 10 and 11. A semantic network generator similar to those disclosed in the above-mentioned patent application EP 962873-A1, can be employed to generate graphs. Referring to the text 11 again, such a network generator would be designed to either generate four separate graphs (first approach), one for each sentence in the text 11, or to generate one common graph for the whole text 11 (second approach). If separate graphs are generated, then these graphs are to be combined in a subsequent step into one common graph. This can be done by identifying identical words in each of the sentences, such that the graphs can be linked together (mapped) via these identical words.<br>
The result of the second approach is illustrated in Figure 10. The common graph 100 comprises semantical units 102 - 124. This graph 100 can then be automatically evolved by employing certain rules. One can for example start this process by putting semantical units of the<br><br>
graph 100 into a relationship. In the present example, the two subjects {}SUB1 109 and {}SUB2 110 are assumed to be the same, since all the sentences of the text 11 are written by the same person (the author or speaker). The two boxes 109 and 110 can thus be combined into a common box {}SUB 125, as illustrated in Figure 11. The structure of the graph 100 can be further evolved using linguistic and/or grammar rules. In evolving the graph 100, the system may take into consideration that definitions by analogy, as in the second sentence of text 11, are quite commonly used to describe things. This fact is represented in the graph 101, that is illustrated in Figure 11. The two analogies "processor" 111 and "spreadsheet" 113 are on the same hierarchical level in the graph 101 as the word "agent" 102. It is now further assumed by the system that the word "human" - which appears twice (boxes 122 and 124) -refers to the same human beings. These two instances 122 and 124 of the word "human" can thus be combined, as shown on the left hand side of Figure 11. The result is depicted as box 126. The word "action" (boxes 118 and 119) can also be combined for the same reason. The result is depicted as box 127.<br>
According to the present invention, graphs can be evolved by removing nodes and/or links, by adding nodes and/or links, by replacing nodes and/or links, and by fusion of nodes and/or links. This is done -according to a predefined set of rules. Note that these are just some example of how graphs can be combined and evolved according to predefined rules. The rules are defined such that the graphs can be matched together making use of their closeness. Additional details about operations for evolving a graph are addressed in our co-pending patent application reference CH9-2000-0036, entitled "Meaning Understanding by Means of Local Pervasive Intelligence".<br>
One may either evolve the graphs of each sentence (sentence graphs) of a text before combining them into one common graph, or one may combine the graphs of each sentence (sentence graphs) into one common graph prior to evolving this common graph. According to the present invention, graphs are combined by fusion of identical instances (nodes). In other words, two identical nodes are combined into one single node.<br>
In an improved implementation of the present invention, a query expansion is preformed. Such a query expansion builds an improved query from the query keyed in by the user. It could be created by adding terms from other documents, or by adding synonyms of terms in the query (as found in a thesaurus).<br>
In yet another embodiment, a parser is employed that generates a mesh-like graph rather than a tree-like graph. The semantic graph generator is an example of such a parser generating mesh-like graphs.<br><br>
The present characterization scheme can also be used in connection with other schemes for classifying texts according to their relevance. One can, for example, combine the characterizing strength C of a document with other abstract measures such as the TFID. This may give a user additional useful clues.<br>
There are different ways to implement the present invention. One can either realize the invention in the client system, or in the server system, or in a distributed fashion across the client and the server. The invention can be implemented by or on a general or special purpose computer.<br>
A computer program in the present context means an expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a device having an information processing capability to perform a particular function.<br>
A first example is given in Figure 8. In this example, the client system 80 comprises all elements 10-18 that were described in connection with Figure 1. There is a keyboard 81 that can be used by the user to key in a query. The result is processed by the client system 80 such that it can be displayed on a display screen 82.<br>
A client-server implementation of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 9. As shown in this Figure, there is a client computer comprising a computing system 93, a keyboard 91, and a display 92. This client computer connects via a network 94 (e.g., the Internet) to a server 90. This server 90 comprises the elements 10 - 18. The query is processed by the server and the characterizing strength is computed by the server. In this embodiment, the result is output in a fashion that it can be sent via the network 94 to the client computer. Likewise, the result can be fetched by the client computer from the server 90. The result is processed by the client computer such that it can be displayed on the display 92. If the users selects one of the texts on the display 92, the corresponding full-text is retrieved from the database 10 located at the server side. The database 10 may even reside on a third computer, or the documents 17 may even be distributed over a multitude of computers. The search engine may also be on another computer, just to mention some variations that are still within the scope of the present invention. Note that there are many different ways to calculate the characterizing strength of texts. The basic idea is to calculate, after evolution of the graph(s), topological invariances. In other words, the characterizing strength (C) is calculated based on the topological structure of the neighborhood. There are different ways to determine the topological invariances of a graph. One may determine distances, or graph dimensions, or connection components, for example. It is also conceivable to define a metric on the graph to define distances between<br><br>
nodes. The nodes of a graph may also have an associated topology table which defines the structure of the neighborhood. Both of these can also be used to determine topological invariances, such as nearest neighbor counting, etc.<br>
As described in connection with the above embodiments, one may count the first neighbors (cf. first embodiment), or the first and second neighbors (cf. Figure 7) in order to determine the characterizing strength (C).<br>
Instead of counting neighbors, or in addition to the counting neighbors, one may remove the word "agent" 102 and the links around this word from the graph 101 such that this graph 101 falls apart, as illustrated in Figure 12. By removing the word "agent" 102 and the links around this word, one obtains five separate subgraphs 130, 131, 132, 133, and 134. The characterizing strength (C) may be determined by counting the number of nodes of the largest subgraphs. In the present example, the largest subgraph is the graph 130. It has 14 nodes. In the present example, the characterizing strength (C) would be 14. Instead of taking the mere number of nodes of the largest subgraph, one can determine the average of the number of nodes of all subgraphs 130, 131, 132, 133, and 134 divided by the number of subgraphs. This would lead to the following result: C = (14+1+2+1 + 1)/5 = 3.8.<br>
Yet another approach is to determine the number of links that link the word "agent" 102 with other nodes. Again using the example given in Figure 11, it would result in C = 6.<br>
One may also determine the characterizing strength (C) by analyzing the number of links per node. The more links there are in a graph, the more likely it is that the graph fully describes the word "agent" 102. Depending on the actual definition of the characterizing strength (C), the value of C may vary in a certain range between 0 and infinity. C may be standardized such that it varies between a lower boundary (e.g., 0) and an upper boundary (e.g., 100), for example. It is appreciated that various features of the invention which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
