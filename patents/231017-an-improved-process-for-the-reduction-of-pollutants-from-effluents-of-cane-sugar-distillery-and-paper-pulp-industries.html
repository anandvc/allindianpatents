				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the  reduction of pollutants from<br>
effluents of cane sugar, distillery and paper&amp; pulp industries.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to an improved method for the treatment of<br>
waste water from cane sugar industry and allied industries (Distillery and Paper &amp;<br>
Pulp Mill) to reduce COD, BOD, IDS and color simultaneously.<br>
In recent years industrial effluents have been regarded as common source of pollution,<br>
because of lack of efficient treatment and improper mode of disposal of effluents<br>
generated by industries. Under these circumstances aquatic life suffers, resulting in<br>
loss of productivity natural waters and deterioration of water quality to such an extent<br>
that the water becomes unusable. It is obvious that the proper treatment of Cane sugar<br>
industry waste water, Distillery effluent (Spent Wash) and effluent from Pulp &amp; Paper<br>
industry (Black Liquor) is quite necessary.<br>
Cane sugar industry is generally flanked by the ancillary industries like Distillery<br>
which uses molasses generated from Cane sugar industry as a raw material and Paper<br>
&amp; Pulp industry which uses bagasse from Cane sugar industry as raw material.<br>
Cane sugar industry produces mainly two types of wastes viz. solid i.e. Bagasse and<br>
Pressmud and liquid wastes i.e. Floor washing &amp; boiler blow down, Soda and acid<br>
wastes, Excess condensate &amp; condenser cooling water :<br>
Bagasse : The residue remaining after extracting the juice from cane is known as<br>
bagasse. It is used as a low grade fuel for boilers. The consumption for boilers in full<br>
is not possible and thus surplus creating a problem for disposal. This can be used for<br>
Pulp &amp; Paper mill Industry and Cardboard Industry. If the bagasse is not fully utilized<br>
in the paper mill it becomes a great nuisance to store it as it is auto-cumbustible and<br>
has to be disposed off in any way.<br>
Liquid Waste as mentioned above contains grease, oils, spill over of the juice in floor washing along with inorganic salts from boiler blow down. The caustic soda and hydrochloric acid are used for removal of scales of tubing which enters the waste water stream contributing the high COD and BOD &amp; TDS.<br>
In recent years industrial effluents have been regarded as common source of pollution, because of lack of efficient treatment and improper mode of disposal of effluents generated by industries. Under these circumstances aquatic life suffers, resulting in loss of productivity natural waters and deterioration of water quality to such an extent that the water becomes unusable. It is obvious that the proper treatment of Distillery effluent (Spent Wash) and effluent from Pulp &amp; Paper industry (Black Liquor) is quite necessary.<br>
The alcohol industry in India is based on molasses as the principal raw material. Molasses contains around 15% of fermentable sugars, out of which 9% is utilized for conversion into alcohol during fermentation. The balance organic &amp; inorganic chemicals in the molasses find their way into the effluent popularly known as spent wash which is acidic in nature. Spent wash which is dark in color has high BOD,COD &amp; TDS. The origin of dark color is mainly due to plant pigments, melanoidins, polyphenolic compounds and caramels which are produced by thermal degradation and condensation reactions of sugar.<br>
The paper and board industries generally use bamboo, straws, bagasse, rags, waste papers and other agricultural residues as raw materials in their manufacturing units. There are several types of processes involved, for which the volume and characteristics of waste water known as black liquor, differ from mill to mill. Black liquor mainly contains 3 -6% of lignin originated from the bark of the plant, which is not easily bio-degradable, along with other organic and inorganic impurities. The dark<br>
color of the black liquor is mainly due to presence of polyphenolic bodies like coniferyl, sinapyl and p- coumaryl alcohols produced during partial degradation of lignin. The pulp &amp; paper industry uses large amounts of water which is recycled and reused resulting in temperature rise and dissolution of more solids in water enhancing problems e.g. corrosion, slime and other deposits. Directly or indirectly all of these viz. COD, BOD, Color and toxicity may affect aquatic life.<br>
In order to conform to environmental quality guidelines a number of primary and secondary treatment systems such as clarifires, aerated lagoons, trickling filters, biomethanation and other biological systems are installed. All these treatments remove reasonably good amount of COD,BOD but not color toxicity and inorganic impurities. Due to stringent environmental norms such partially treated effluents of distillery and paper industries are not allowed to be mixed in the natural stream, in the prior art the following methods are used to remove COD, BOD, TDS and color of Black Liquor and Spent Wash separately. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief herein bellow : Water management in Mauritius.<br>
Baguant, J.; Ramjeawon, T. (University of Mauritius, Reduit, Mauritius). Int. Sugar J., 98(1171), 351-358 (English) 1996. CODEN: ISUJA3. ISSN: 0020-8841. DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 60 (Waste Treatment and Disposal) Section cross-reference(s): 52, 61, CA 125: 229505<br>
Baguant &amp; Ramjeawon have shown that the cane sugar industry in Mauritius requires 45-50 Mm3 of water, 10% of the island's total annual water demand, to process 5-6 million tonnes of cane during the crop season (June - Dec.). Mauritius is a water-poor country, with an annual fresh water availability of 1550 mVcapita. A shortage of fresh water limits industrial and economic growth, and environmental regulations add<br>
to the problem. It is important to minimize water use for sugar manufacture through recycling and process modifications, and to adopt wastewater treatment systems. A water utilization study used in a factory crushing 100 tones cane/h to demonstrate the potential for saving water. A high-rate anaerobic treatment system (UASB) was investigated using a wastewater characterization survey of 6 sugar factories. Under certain conditions, the UASB reactor reduced the COD concentrated by 90%, and produced methane gas at a rate of 0.2 m3/kg COD. Cogeneration in the Hawaiian sugar industry.<br>

Treatment of alcohol distillery effluent using sugar cane pith. Lopez Hernandez, J. (Natl. Univ. Tucuman, Argent.). Int. Sugar J., 93(1112), 155-8 (English) 1991. CODEN: ISUJA3. ISSN: 0020-8841. DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 16 (Fermentation and Bioindustrial Chemistry), CA116:126948 Harnandez has discussed a method for alcohol distillery effluent treatment using sugar cane pith to be combined with vinasse so that it can be burnt in the conventional boilers of the sugar factory. The method is based on the fact that pith can absorb more than five times its own weight of vinasse without draining. When one part of pith is mixed with one part of vinasse, the mixture contains 70% moisture. This can be reduced to 50% by using 53% of the flue gases from the boilers of the sugar factory at 250° C in the pneumatic transport dryer. The dried mixture of pith and vinasse can be burned in the conventional boilers of the sugar factory. The calorific value of the solids in vinasse is the same as that of bagasse and they contribute heat that is equal to 15% of the heat liberated by the bagasse producing steam in excess of the distillery requirements. The ash from the boiler is rich in potassium and can be used as fertilizer. The proposed method solves entirely the problem of pollution by stillage, and the net value of the heat from the solids in vinasse, plus the fertilizer value of the ash, exceeds the net profit obtained from the alcohol produced by the distillery.<br>

(Industrial Carbohydrates)<br>
Nemerow   &amp;  Dasgupta  have   studied  that  a   sugar   refinery   designed  as   an<br>
environmentally balanced industrial complex to attain potential zero pollution would<br>
contain a sugarcane refinery, an agricultural area for growing sugarcane, an alcohol<br>
production plant, and a power plant producing both steam and electricity.    An<br>
anaerobic digester for bagasse-cachaza mixture is the heart of the complex and<br>
handles residual wastes generated in sugar manufacture. The complex would produce<br>
4 major products, i.e., electrical energy, refined sugar, alcohol, and molasses, and use<br>
4 products within the complex, i.e., fermentation mash, digested and filtered sludge,<br>
digester gas, and steam. No wastes would be released to the air or water.<br>

Patil &amp; Kapadnis have studied decolorization of spentwash melanoidin pigment by chemical and biological methods. Spentwash from an anaerobic digester was treated with hydrogen peroxide, calcium oxide and soil bacteria. At 144 h. of incubation at varied concentrations of hydrogen peroxide the maximum decolorization and COD reduction was 98.67 and 88.40%, respectively<br>
An absorption mechanism for the decolorization of melanoidin by Rhizoctonia sp. D-90.<br>
Sirianuntapiboon, Suntud; Sihanonth, Prakitsin; Somchai, Praphaisri; Atthasampunna, Poonsook; Hayashida, Shinsaku (Thailand Inst. Scientific Technological Res., Bangkok 10900, Thailand). Biosci., Biotechnol., Biochem., 59(7), 1185-9 (English) 1995. CODEN: BBBIEJ. ISSN: 0916-8451. DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 60 (Waste Treatment and Disposal) Section cross-reference(s): 10, 16, CA 123:151772<br>
Sirianuntapiboon et al have observed that Rhizoctonia species D-90 decolorized molasses melanoidin medium and a synthetic melanoidin medium by 87.5% and 84.5%, respectively , under experimental growth conditions. Mycelia grown in solns. of melanoidin turned dark brown; however, the melanoidin (dark brown in color) could be eluted from mycelia by washing in a NaOH soln., and the max. yield of melanoidin from mycelia reached 96.1%. Mycelia grown in potato dextrose medium did not have any electron-dense materials in the cytoplasm or around the cell membrane, but when such mycelia were transferred to melanoidin media, abundant electron-dense material appeared in the cytoplasm and around cell membranes. Subsequently, the electron-dense materials disappeared when the mycelia were<br>
returned to the potato dextrose medium for further growth. The Rhizoctonia species D-90 melanoidin decolorization mechanism involved melanoidin pigment absorption by the cells as a macromol. and its intracellular accumulation in the cytoplasm and around the cell membrane as a melanoidin complex, which was then gradually decolorized by intracellular enzymes.<br>
Removal of dissolved organic carbon in winery and distillery wastewater by application to soil.<br>
Chapman, J.A.; Correll, R.N.; Ladd, J.N. (Department of Soil Science, University of Adelaide, Glen Osmond 5064, Australia). Rev. Fr. Oenol., 152, 47-9 (English) 1995. CODEN: RFOEE4. ISSN: 0395-899X. DOCUMENT TYPE: Journal CA Section: 60 (Waste Treatment and Disposal) Section cross-reference(s): 16, CA 123:121955 Chapman et al have reported that wineries produce about 2-5 L wastewater/L of table wine manufactured. Wastewater is gaining recognition as a potential source of supplementary irrigation water, particularly in districts where restrictions have been placed on the use of groundwater for irrigation. Winery wastewater is usually lagooned, to allow solids to settle, before applying the effluent to soil. Lagooned winery and distillery effluents contain about 0.5-2 and 3-15 g org. C/L, respectively. This solution C must be removed from the effluent to avoid unacceptable increases in the organic C in groundwater receiving excess water from the irrigated sites. The removal of solution organic C from winery and distillery wastewaters by adsorption and microbial decay in soils, was detected under different levels of C loading.

Sekiguchi et al have investigated the decolorization and degrdn. of molasses pigments (melanoidins) in wastewater from yeast factories by ionizing radiation. In the case of samples with the same value of chromaticity (4000), the reduction degree of chromaticity of dialyzed sample reached 27.5% and 75% at a dose of 4.5 kGy and 14 kGy, respectively, and was greater than that of non-dialyzed sample. Organic acids such as oxalic acid, formic acid and glycolic acid were formed with increasing dose, and the biodegradability (BOD/COD) of wastewater was increased with decrease in pH. The relationships between the value of chromaticity/TOC and molecular weight of molasses pigments, were obtained from subsequent experiment using dialyzed and non-dialyzed samples with the same value of TOC.<br>

A study was conducted by Shen et al to remove color from a chemical manufacturing effluent. The effluent contained high levels of soluble organic compounds. The effluent was intensely black; the high solubility of colored constituents made common coagulation or adsorption techniques unsuitable for color removal. Results showed<br>
that a combination of FeCl2.4H2O (as a reducing agent), lime, and bone charcoal<br>
removed 97% of the color.<br>

Due to the scarcity of water sources within the city, Tokyo is dependent on water from other prefectures. Recycling municipal wastewater is an effective means of coping with water shortage in Tokyo. Radiation treatment of wastewater for water recycling was studied by Sawai et al, specifically, degradation of molasses pigments in yeast manufacturing effluent. Dialyzed molasses pigments and non-dialyzed samples in wastewater were compared by chromaticity, UV absorption, color difference, and COD content. Dialysis and fractionation by permeable membrane were conducted with seamless cellulose tubing (Union Carbide Corporation) and spectra/Por membrane (Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.). Total organic C (TOC) concentration decreased and the dark brown color faded with increasing dose. High mol. wt. components of molasses pigments were degraded to lower mol. wt. substances and decomposed to CO2. The relationships between chromaticity/TOC and molasses pigments mol. wt. were obtained by radiation.<br>

Three white-rot fungi (IZU-154, Phanerochaete chrysosporium Burds and Coriolus versicoloy (L. ex Fr.) Quel.) were tested by Lee et al for their abilities to decolorize kraft bleaching effluents from the 1st alkaline extraction stage. The fungus IZU-154 exhibited the effective decolorization of not only hardwood but also softwood kraft pulp bleaching effluent. For the softwood bleach plant effluent containing 10,000 color units (CU) , treatment with IZU-154 in the presence of a small amount of glucose (0.5%) resulted in 78% and 89% reduction of the color after one- and two-day incubation, respectively. On the other hand, when the effluent was treated under the same conditions, only 32% and 36% of the decolorization with C. versicolor and 49%<br>
and 72% of the decolorization with P. chrysosporium were observed within one- and two-day incubations, respectively. In comparison with 53% and 78% of color reductions achieved by IZU-154 with the softwood bleach plant effluent including glucose, addition of glucono-d-lactone to the effluent showed remarkable decolorizations of 83% and 94% within 12- and 24-h incubations respectively. Furthermore, the color of the effluent was effectively removed by the addition of acetic acid as an additive. Therefore, a greater color reduction by IZU-154 can be expected for a possible biotechnological application. Biological decolorization of paper mill wastewater.<br>

In hitherto known processes attempts have been made to treat sugar factory effluent, spent wash and black liquor separately.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the reduction of pollutants from effluents of cane sugar, distillery and paper&amp; pulp industries.<br>
The  process   of the  present   invention   removes   COD,   BOD  TDS   and  color simultaneously at 20 to 40°C temperature from a mixture of sugar factory effluent,<br>
spent wash from distillery and black liquor from pulp and paper industry, thus saving energy cost, the operation does not involve any use of mineral acid thus, avoiding corrosion problems. The novelty of the process lies in the use of flocculating agent, comprising a mixture of salt of Group III elements and transition metals, mixture of natural earths along with an oxide of alkaline earth metal followed by the use of combination of ion exchange resins .<br>
There is a continued interest on development of new improved process for removal of color, lignin, TDS, COD, BOD &amp; other organic and inorganic matter produced during the manufacture of sugar, alcohol fermentation and alkali digestion of pulp. It is a well known fact that lignin and color in such types of effluents are not easily biodegradable and hence, have disposal problems in the natural environment. The pollutants like oil &amp; grease, spill-over of juice, soda and acids from tube washings originating from sugar factory effluent also have disposal problems. Indion 840 is strong acid macroporous cation exchange resin having styrene matrix with sulphite as functional group and Indion -930 A is a strong base macroporous Type I anion exchange resin having polyacrylic links with quaternary ammonium functional groups. The adsorption on these resins is reversible and the resins are resistant to organic fouling.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the reduction of pollutants from effluents of cane sugar, distillery and paper &amp; pulp industries which comprises treating the effluent of industry selected from cane sugar, distillery, paper&amp; pulp and a mixture thereof with a flocculating agent selected from mixture of sulphate or chloride or nitrate of element selected from Group III elements and transition metals along with an oxide of alkali or alkaline earth metal such as calcium along with natural earth metals dolomite and bentonite and a natural adsorbant ,for a<br>
period of 10 - 30 minutes, at a temperature in the range 25-35°C, allowing the effluent to settle for a period of 3 to 4 hours, separating the supernatant and contacting the said supernatant with a mixture of ion exchange resin of the kind as herein described , for a period ranging from 5- 30 minutes, allowing it to settle and separating the supernatant to obtain the desired pollutants reduced effluent. In an embodiment of the present invention the ratio of sugar factory effluent to spent wash used in a mixture of effluents of cane sugar and distillery waste is in the range of 20-50:20-50.<br>
In an another embodiment the ratio of sugar factory effluent to black liquor used in a mixture of sugar factory effluent and black liquor is in the ratio of 20-50 : 20 - 50. In yet another embodiment the ratio of sugar factory effluent, spent wash and black liquor used in a mixture of sugar factory effluent, spent wash and black liquor is in the range of 90-100 : 45-55 : 45-55, preferably in the range of 100 : 50: 50. In yet   another embodiment the flocculating agent used is a mixture of sulphate or chloride or nitrate of element selected from Group III elements and transition metals along with an oxide of alkali or alkaline earth metal such as calcium along with natural earth metals dolomite and bentonite and a natural adsorbant. In yet    another embodiment the flocculating agent used comprising the ratio of aluminum sulphate : ferrous sulphate : dolomite : bentonite : charcoal powder in the range of 35-45 : 45-55 : 3-6 : 3-6: 2-4, preferably in the range of 40 : 50 : 5 : 5: 3. In yet  another embodiment the mixture of ion exchange resins used is a mixture of atleast two different commercially available resins selected from the group consisting of IR -120, IR- 400, MB-106, Gel-A 23, ADS-600, Indion-840 and Indion-930 A, preferably a mixture of Indion 840 and Indion 930 A.in a ratio of 1:1 (v/v).<br>
In yet another embodiment the pollutants reduced from the effluents are colour, liginins, total dissolved solid (TDS), COD,BOD and other organic and inorganic materials.<br>
Novelty of the process lies in the reduction of pollutants of Spent wash, Black liquor and Sugar factory effluent. There is no reference available mentioning, this type of simultaneous effluent treatment. The process does not involve any use of mineral acid, thus avoiding corrosion problems. The process does not involve use of any expensive chemicals or enzymes, thus it is a cost effective easy to handle process. As the end products are not hazardous the process is eco-friendly.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below with reference to the examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to the limit of scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
