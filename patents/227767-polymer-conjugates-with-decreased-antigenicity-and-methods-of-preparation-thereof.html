METHODS OF PREPARATION THEREOF"<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of tHe Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention is in the fields of protein biochemistry and the<br>
pharmaceutical and medical sciences. In particular, the invention provides<br>
methods for the production of conjugates between water-soluble polymers<br>
(e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) and derivatives thereof) and bioactive components,<br>
which conjugates have reduced antigenicity and immunogenicity compared to<br>
standard polymer-bioactive component conjugates. The invention also<br>
provides conjugates produced by such methods, compositions comprising such<br>
conjugates, kits comprising such conjugates and compositions and metliods of<br>
use of the conjugates and compositions in preventing, diagnosing and treating<br>
a variety of medical and veterinary conditions.<br>
Related Art<br>
[0002] Two key factors have hindered the development of recombinant<br>
proteins as therapeutic agents — their generally short half-lives in the<br>
circulation and their potential antigenicity and immunogenicity. As used<br>
herein and generally in the art, the term "antigenicity" refers to the ability of a<br>
molecule to bind to preexisting antibodies, while the term "immunogenicity"<br>
refers to the ability to evoke an immune response in vivo, whether that<br>
response involves the formation of antibodies (a "humoral response") or the<br>
stimulation of cellular immune responses. For the administration of<br>
recombinant therapeutic proteins, intravenous (i.v.) administration is often<br>
desirable in order to achieve the highest circulating activities and to minimize<br>
problems of bioavailability and degradation. However, the half-lives of small<br>
proteins following i.v. administration are usually extremely short (see<br>
examples in Mordenti, J., et al, (1991) Pharm Res 5:1351-1359; Kuwabara,<br>
T., et al, (1995) Pharm Res 72:1466-1469). Healthy kidneys generally retain<br><br>
in the bloodstream proteins with hydrodynamic radii exceeding that of serum<br>
albumin, which has a Stokes radius of c. 36 A and a molecular weight of<br>
c. 66,000 Daltons (66 kDa). However, smaller proteins, such as granulocyte<br>
colony-stimulating factor ("G-CSF") and ribonuclease, are cleared rapidly<br>
from the bloodstream by glomerular filtration (Brenner, B.M., et al. (1978) Am<br>
J Physiol 234:F455-F460; Venkatachalam, M.A., et al. (1978) Circ Res<br>
43:337-347; Wilson, G., (1979) J Gen Physiol 74:495-509). As a result,<br>
maintenance of therapeutically useful concentrations of small recombinant<br>
proteins in the circulation is problematic following i.v. administration.<br>
Therefore, higher concentrations of such proteins and more frequent injections<br>
must be administered. The high dose rate increases the cost of therapy,<br>
decreases the likelihood of patient compliance and increases the risk of<br>
adverse events, e.g., immune reactions. Both cellular and humoral immune<br>
responses can reduce the circulating concentrations of injected recombinant<br>
proteins to an extent that may preclude the administration of an effective dose<br>
or may lead to treatment-limiting events such as anaphylaxis (Pui, C.-H., et al.<br>
(2001) J Clin Oncol 19:697-704).<br>
[0003] Alternative routes of administration, such as subcutaneous (s.c.) or<br>
intramuscular (i.m.) injections, can overcome some of these problems, by<br>
providing more gradual release of recombinant proteins into the circulation.<br>
However, the bioavailability can be quite low, making it difficult to achieve<br>
effective circulating concentrations of such drugs. A further problem that may<br>
be related to the poor bioavailability of drugs administered s.c. or i.m. is the<br>
increased probability of degradation of the therapeutic protein at the site of<br>
injection.<br>
[0004] Modification of recombinant proteins by the covalent attachment of<br>
derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) ("PEG") has been investigated extensively<br>
as a means of addressing the shortcomings discussed above (reviewed in<br>
Sherman, M.R., et al. (1997) in: Poly(ethylene glycol): Chemistry and<br>
Biological Applications, Harris, J.M., et al., eds., American Chemical Society,<br>
Washington, D.C., pp. 155-169; Roberts, M.J., et al (2002) Adv Drug Deliv<br>
Res 54:459-476). The attachment of PEG derivatives to proteins has been<br>
shown to stabilize the proteins, improve their bioavailability and/or reduce<br><br>
their immunogenicity in vivo. (The covalent attachment of PEG derivatives to<br>
a protein or other substrate is referred to herein, and is known in the art, as<br>
"PEGylation.") In addition, PEGylation can increase the hydrodynamic radius<br>
of proteins significantly. When a small protein, such as a cytokine or<br>
polypeptide hormone, is coupled to a single long strand of PEG (e.g., having a<br>
molecular weight of at least about 18 kDa), the resultant conjugate has a larger<br>
hydrodynamic radius than that of serum albumin and its clearance via the renal<br>
glomeruli is dramatically retarded. The combined effects of PEGylation —<br>
reduced proteolysis, reduced immune recognition and reduced rates of renal<br>
clearance ~ confer substantial advantages on PEGylated proteins as<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
[0005] Since the 1970s, attempts have been made to use the covalent<br>
attachment of polymers to improve the safety and efficacy of various proteins<br>
for pharmaceutical use (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,179,337). Some examples<br>
include the coupling of PEG or poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to adenosine<br>
deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) for use in the treatment of severe combined<br>
immunodeficiency disease (Davis, S., et al. (1981) Clin Exp Immunol 46:649-<br>
652; Hershfield, M.S., et al. (1987) N Engl J Med 37(5:589-596). Other<br>
examples include the coupling of PEG to superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1)<br>
for the treatment of inflammatory conditions (Saifer, M., et al., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,006,333 and 5,080,891) and to urate oxidase (EC 1.7.3.3) for the<br>
elimination of excess uric acid from the blood and urine (Inada, Y., Japanese<br>
Patent Application 55-099189; Kelly, S.J., et al. (2001) J Am Soc Nephrol<br>
12:1001-1009; Wilhams, L.D., et al., PCT publication WO 00/07629 A3,<br>
corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 6,576,235; Sherman, M.R., et al., PCT<br>
publication WO 01/59078 A2).<br>
[0006] PEOs and PEGs are polymers composed of covalently linked ethylene<br>
oxide units. These polymers have the following general structure:<br>
R1-(OCH2CH2)n-R2<br>
where R2 may be a hydroxyl group (or a reactive derivative thereof) and R1<br>
may be hydrogen, as in "PEG diol", a methyl group, as in monomethoxyPEG<br>
("mPEG"), or another lower alkyl group, e.g., as in iso-propoxyPEG or<br>
r-butoxyPEG. The parameter n in the general structure of PEG indicates the<br><br>
number of ethylene oxide units in the polymer and is referred to herein and in<br>
the art as the "degree of polymerization." PEGs and PEOs can be linear,<br>
branched (Fuke, I., et al. (1994) J Control Release 30:27-34) or star-shaped<br>
(Merrill, E.W. (1993) J Biomater Sci Polym Ed 5:1-11). PEGs and PEOs are<br>
amphipathic, i.e. they are soluble in water and in certain organic solvents and<br>
they can adhere to lipid-containing materials, including enveloped viruses and<br>
the membranes of animal and bacterial cells. Certain random or block or<br>
alternating copolymers of ethylene oxide (OCH2CH2) and propylene oxide,<br>
which has the following structure:<br><br>
have properties that are sufficiently similar to those of PEG that these<br>
copolymers are thought to be suitable replacements for PEG in certain<br>
applications (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,609,546 and 5,283,317). The term<br>
"polyalkylene oxides" and the abbreviation "PAOs" are used herein to refer to<br>
such copolymers, as well as to PEG or PEO and poly(oxyethylene-<br>
oxymethylene) copolymers (U.S. Patent No. 5,476,653). As used herein, the<br>
term "polyalkylene glycols" and the abbreviation "PAGs" are used to refer<br>
generically to polymers suitable for use in the conjugates of the invention,<br>
particularly PEGs, more particularly PEGs containing a single reactive group<br>
("monofimctionally activated PEGs").<br>
[0007] Commonly, several (e.g., 5 to 10) strands of one or more PAGs, e.g.,<br>
one or more mPEGs with a molecular weight of about 5 kDa to about 10 kDa,<br>
are coupled to the target protein via primary amino groups (the epsilon amino<br>
groups of lysine residues and the alpha amino group of the N-terminal amino<br>
acid). More recently, conjugates have been synthesized containing a single<br>
strand of mPEG of higher molecular weight, e.g.. 12 kDa, 20 kDa or 30 kDa.<br>
Direct correlations have been demonstrated between the plasma half-lives of<br>
the conjugates and an increasing molecular weight and/or increasing number<br>
of strands of PEG coupled (Clark, R., et al. (1996) JBiol Chem 271:11969-<br>
21977). On the other hand, as the number of strands of PEG is increased, so is<br>
the probability that an amino group in an essential region of the bioactive<br><br>
component (particularly if the bioactive component is a protein) will be<br>
modified, impairing its biological function (e.g., catalysis by an enzyme or<br>
receptor binding by a cytokine). For larger proteins that contain many amino<br>
groups, and for enzymes with substrates of low molecular weight, this tradeoff<br>
between increased duration of action and decreased specific activity may be<br>
acceptable, since it produces a net increase in the biological activity of the<br>
PEG-containing conjugates in vivo. For smaller proteins, such as polypeptide<br>
hormones and cytokines, however, a relatively high degree of substitution is<br>
likely to decrease the functional activity to the point of negating the advantage<br>
of an extended half-life in the bloodstream (Clark, R., et al, supra).<br>
[0008] Certain of the present inventors have pioneered a variety of<br>
PEGylation strategies and have applied them to several proteins to achieve the<br>
desirable combination of favorable pharmacokinetics and increased potency<br>
in vivo. These proteins include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating<br>
factor ("GM-CSF") (Saifer, M.G.P., etal. (1997) Polym Preprints 38:516-<br>
577; Sherman, M.R., et al. (1997) supra) and recombinant mammalian uricase<br>
(see PCX publications WO 00/07629 and WO 01/59078; Kelly, S.J., et al..<br>
supra; U.S. Patent No. 6,576,235). Using GM-CSF as a model cytokine,<br>
certain of the present inventors demonstrated that the attachment of one or two<br>
strands of mPEG of high molecular weight (about 36 kDa) was sufficient to<br>
enhance dramatically the potency of recombinant murine GM-CSF in vivo<br>
(Saifer, M.G.P., et al. (1997) supra; Sherman, M.R., et al. (1997) supra).<br>
[0009] Studies have also been conducted in which recombinant mammalian<br>
urate oxidase (uricase) was modified and explored as a potential treatment for<br>
intractable gout (see PCX publications WO 00/07629, corresponding to U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,576,235, and WO 01/59078, the disclosures of which are entirely<br>
incorporated herein by reference). When the PEG-uricase was used to treat<br>
uricase-deficient mice (uox-/-) that displayed profound uric acid-induced<br>
nephropathy, it was found to be well tolerated, effective and substantially non-<br>
immunogenic. Xreated mice exhibited improved renal fimction for the<br>
duration of treatment (10 weeks) and had substantially less uric acid-related<br>
kidney damage than untreated uox -/- mice, as demonstrated by microscopic<br>
magnetic resonance imaging (Kelly, S.J., et al. (2001) supra).<br><br>
[0010] The covalent attachment of strands of a PAG to a polypeptide<br>
molecule is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,179,337 to Davis, F.F., etai, as<br>
well as in Abuchowski, A., et al. (1981) in: Enzymes as Drugs, Holcenberg,<br>
J.S., et al, eds., John Wiley and Sons, New York, pp. 367-383. These<br>
references disclose that enzymes and other proteins modified with mPEGs<br>
have reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity and have longer lifetimes in<br>
the bloodstream, compared to the corresponding unmodified proteins. The<br>
resultant beneficial properties of the chemically modified conjugates are very<br>
useful in a variety of therapeutic applications.<br>
[0011] To effect the covalent attachment of PEG or polyalkylene oxides to a<br>
protein, at least one of the hydroxyl end groups of the polymer must first be<br>
converted into a reactive functional group. This process is fi-equently referred<br>
to as "activation" and the product is called "activated PEG" or activated<br>
polyalkylene oxide. MonomethoxyPEG that is capped on one end with an<br>
unreactive, chemically stable methyl ether (the "methoxyl group") and on the<br>
other end with a lunctional group reactive towards amino groups on a protein<br>
molecule is most commonly used for such approaches. So-called "branched"<br>
mPEGs, which contain two or more methoxyl groups distal firom a single<br>
activated functional group, are used less commonly. An example is di-mPEG-<br>
lysine, in which the carboxyl group of lysine is most often activated by<br>
esterification with N-hydroxysuccinimide (Harris, J.M., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,932,462).<br>
[0012] The activated polymers are reacted with a therapeutic agent having<br>
nucleophilic functional groups that serve as attachment sites. One nucleo-<br>
philic functional group commonly used as an attachment site is the epsilon<br>
amino group of lysine residues. Free carboxylic acid groups, suitably<br>
activated carbonyl groups, oxidized carbohydrate moieties and thiol groups<br>
have also been used as attachment sites.<br>
[0013] The hydroxyl group of mPEG has been activated with cyanuric<br>
chloride and the resulting compound then coupled with proteins (Abuchowski,<br>
A., etal. (1977) J Biol Chem 252:3582-3586; Abuchowski, A., etal (1981)<br>
supra). The use of this method has disadvantages however, such as the<br>
toxicity of cyanuric chloride and its non-specific reactivity for proteins having<br><br>
functional groups other than amines, such as solvent-accessible cysteine or<br>
tyrosine residues that may be essential for function.<br>
[0014] In order to overcome these and other disadvantages, alternative<br>
activated PEGs have been introduced, such as succinimidyl succinate<br>
derivatives of mPEG ("SS-PEG") (Abuchowski, A., et al. (1984) Cancer<br>
Biochem Biophys 7:175-186). Under mild conditions, SS-PEG reacts quickly<br>
with proteins (within 30 minutes), yielding active, yet extensively modified<br>
conjugates.<br>
[0015] M. Saifer, et ai, in U.S. Patent No. 5,468,478, disclose polyalkylene<br>
glycol-mono-N-succinimidyl carbonates and conjugates produced therefrom.<br>
S. Zalipsky, in U.S. Patent No. 5,612,460, discloses methods for preparation<br>
of poly(ethylene glycol)-N-succinimidyl carbonates. This form of the polymer<br>
("SC-PEG") reacts readily with the amino groups of proteins, as well as<br>
peptides of low molecular weight and other materials that contain free amino<br>
groups, with which it forms urethane bonds.<br>
[0016] Urethane (or carbamate) linkages between the amino groups of the<br>
protein and the PEG are also known in the art to be produced from other PEG-<br>
carbonate derivatives (Beauchamp, C, etal. (1983) Anal Biochem 131:25-33;<br>
Veronese, F.M., et al. (1985) ApplBiochem Biotechnol ii:141-152). Reactive<br>
mPEG intennediates and methods for their use are also known in the art for<br>
the synthesis of PEG conjugates of bioactive components linked via amide<br>
bonds, ester bonds, secondary amines and thioester bonds, among others.<br>
[0017] T. Suzuki et al. ((1984) Biochim Biophys Acta 755:248-255)<br>
covalently coupled immunoglobulin G ("IgG") to mPEG that had been<br>
activated by cyanuric chloride. They studied the biological and<br>
physicochemical properties, such as antigen-binding activity and the<br>
molecular structure, size-exclusion chromatographic behavior, surface<br>
activity, interfacial aggregability and heat aggregability that induced<br>
nonspecific activation of complement by the PEG-IgG conjugates. The<br>
coupling of PEG to IgG increased the apparent Stokes radius and the surface<br>
activity of IgG and stabilized IgG to heating and/or the exposure to interfaces,<br>
while no structural denaturation of IgG was observed. The suppression of<br>
nonspecific aggregability was attributed mainly to the steric inhibition of the<br>
association between the PEGylated IgG molecules. These results indicated the<br><br>
utility of mPEG-coupled IgG as an intravenous preparation and also suggested<br>
the utility of PEG as an additive to stabilize unmodified IgG for intravenous<br>
use.<br>
[0018] K.A. Sharp et al. ((1986) Anal Biochem 154:110-117) investigated the<br>
possibility of producing biospecific affinity ligands for separating cells in<br>
aqueous two-phase polymer systems on the basis of cell surface antigens.<br>
Rabbit anti-human erythrocyte IgG was reacted with cyanuric chloride-<br>
activated mPEGs with molecular weights of approximately 0.2, 1.9 and 5 kDa<br>
at various molar ratios of PEG to lysine groups on the protein. The partition<br>
coefficient of the protein in a two-phase system containing dextran and PEG<br>
increased with increasing degree of modification and increasing molecular<br>
weight of the mPEG. There was a concomitant loss in ability to agglutinate<br>
human erythrocytes.<br>
[0019] R.H. Tullis, in U.S. Patent No. 4,904,582, discloses oligonucleotide<br>
conjugates wherein the oligonucleotides are joined through a linking arm to a<br>
hydrophobic moiety, which could be a polyoxyalkylene group. The resulting<br>
conjugates are said to be more efficient in membrane transport, so as to be<br>
capable of crossing the membrane and effectively modulating a transcriptional<br>
system. In this way, the compositions can be used in vitro and in vivo for<br>
studying cellular processes, protecting mammalian hosts from pathogens,<br>
facilitating gene therapy, and the like.<br>
[0020] Excessive conjugation of polymers and/or conjugation involving the<br>
active site of a therapeutic moiety where groups associated with bioactivity are<br>
found, however, can often result in loss of activity and, thus, in loss of<br>
therapeutic efficacy. This is often the case with lower molecular weight<br>
peptides that have few attachment sites that are not associated with bioactivity.<br>
For example, I. Benhar et al. ((1994) Bioconjug Chem 5:321-326) observed<br>
that PEGylation of a recombinant single-chain immunotoxin resulted in the<br>
loss of specific target immunoreactivity of the immunotoxin. The loss of<br>
activity of the immunotoxin was the result of attachment of PEG to two lysine<br>
residues within the antigen-combining region of the immunotoxin.<br>
[0021] Although the covalent attachment of PAGs and PAOs (e.g., PEGs,<br>
PEOs, etc.) to therapeutic proteins is intended to eliminate their<br><br>
immunoreactivity, PEGylated proteins remain weakly immunogenic. This<br>
immunogenicity appears to be due, at least in part, to the fact that PEG and<br>
PAO polymers are themselves somewhat antigenic and immunogenic. For<br>
example, rabbits have been immunized to various PEGs by injecting the<br>
animals with conjugates in which PEG was coupled to an immunogenic carrier<br>
protein (Richter, A.W., et al. (1983) Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol 70:124-<br>
131). In addition, a monoclonal antibody that reacts with the polyether<br>
backbone of PEG has been developed by injecting mice with an mPEG<br>
conjugate of β-glucuronidase and selecting a hybridoma clone that secretes an<br>
anti-PEG antibody (Cheng, T.-L., et al. (1999) Bioconjug Chem 10:520-528;<br>
Cheng, T.-L., et al. (2000) Bioconjug Chem 11:258-266; Tsai, N.-M., et al.<br>
(2001) Biotechniques 30:396-402; Roffler, S., et al., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,596,849 and 6,617,118; the disclosures of all of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entireties). Another monoclonal antibody that<br>
reacts with the polyether backbone of PEG has been disclosed recently by<br>
Roberts, M.J., et al., in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/001704 Al.<br>
[0022] A number of investigators have disclosed the preparation of linear or<br>
branched "non-antigenic" PEG polymers and derivatives or conjugates thereof<br>

patent application nos. 2002/0052443, 2002/0061307 and 2002/0098192).<br>
Most of the examples in the foregoing patents and patent applications employ<br>
polymers containing one or more strands of mPEG, e.g., di-mPEG-lysine. To<br>
date, however, there has been no disclosure of a mechanism for rendering the<br>
PEG in such polymers or conjugates non-antigenic.<br>
[0023] Thus, there exists a need for the identification of methods of producing<br>
PAO-containing (e.g., PEG- ancl/or PEO-containing) conjugates, particularly<br>
conjugates between such water-soluble polymers and therapeutic proteins,<br>
with reduced, substantially reduced or no detectable antigenicity. Such<br>
conjugates will have the benefits provided by the polymer component of<br>
increased stability and bioavailability in vivo, but will not elicit a substantial<br><br>
immune response in an animal into which the conjugates have been introduced<br>
for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024] The present invention addresses the needs identified above, and<br>
provides methods for the preparation of conjugates of water-soluble polymers<br>
(e.g., poly(ethylene glycol) and derivatives thereof) and bioactive components,<br>
particularly therapeutic bioactive components, such as proteins. The invention<br>
also provides polymers and conjugates produced by such methods, which<br>
polymers and conjugates have reduced antigenicity and immunogenicity,<br>
compared to alkoxyl-containing polymers and conjugates of the same<br>
bioactive component prepared with alkoxyPEGs, e.g., mPEG. The invention<br>
also provides compositions comprising such conjugates, kits containing such<br>
conjugates and compositions and methods of use of the conjugates and<br>
compositions in a variety of therapeutic and diagnostic regimens.<br>
[0025] In one aspect, the invention provides a conjugate comprising one or<br>
more bioactive components covalently linked to at least one linear or branched<br>
monofunctionally activated polyalkylene glycol, wherein the mono-<br>
functionally activated polyalkylene glycol does not comprise a methoxyl<br>
group, another alkoxyl group or an aryloxyl group at any terminus. In certain<br>
such embodiments, the conjugate has reduced or substantially reduced<br>
antigenicity compared to a conjugate prepared using an alkoxypoly(ethylene<br>
glycol), e.g., mPEG, or a branched polymer containing mPEG, such as di-<br>
mPEG-lysine.<br>
[0026] Polyalkylene glycols that are particularly suitable for use in the<br>
synthesis of the conjugates of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
poly(ethylene glycols) and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide;<br>
particularly preferred are PEGs, and more particularly preferred are<br>
monofunctionally activated PEGS (e.g., PEGs that are activated at a single<br>
terminus, including hydroxyPEG-monoaldehydes, hydroxyPEG-monovinyl-<br>
sulfones, reactive esters of hydroxyPEG-monocarboxylic acids and<br>
hydroxyPEG-monophenyl carbonate derivatives). Other intermediates that<br><br>
can be useful for the synthesis of the reactive polymer derivatives include<br>
other hydroxyPEG-monoacids and hydroxyPEG-monoacetals.<br>
[0027] In certain such embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol has a molecular<br>
weight of from about 1,000 Daltons to about 100 kDa, preferably about 2 kDa<br>
to about 60 kDa; about 2 kDa to about 30 kDa, about 5 kDa to about 20 kDa;<br>
about 10 kDa to about 30 kDa; about 10 kDa to about 20 kDa; two branches<br>
each with a molecular weight of about 2 kDa to about 30 kDa; and more<br>
preferably two branches, each of about 18 kDa to about 22 kDa. Conjugates<br>
according to this aspect of the invention may comprise one or more strands of<br>
polyalkylene glycol, in certain embodiments preferably from about one to<br>
about 10 strands, from about one to about five strands, more preferably from<br>
about one to about three strands, and most preferably from about one to about<br>
two sfrands; in other embodiments preferably from about five to about 100<br>
sfrands, from about 10 to about 50 sfrands and more preferably from about six<br>
to about 20 sfrands per subunit of high molecular weight enzyme proteins. In<br>
a particularly preferred such embodiment, the polyalkylene glycol used in the<br>
conjugate comprises one or two strands of a monofunctionally activated<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) (e.g., a reactive ester of a hydroxyPEG-monoacid, a<br>
hydroxyPEG-monoaldehyde, a hydroxyPEG-monovinylsulfone or a<br>
hydroxyPEG-monophenyl carbonate derivative) having a molecular weight of<br>
from about 18 kDa to about 22 kDa or about 27 kDa to about 33 kDa.<br>
[0028] Suitable bioactive components for use in the conjugates or<br>
compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, a variety of<br>
peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, organic compounds, amine-containing<br>
compounds, carboxyl-containing compounds, hydroxyl-containing compounds<br>
and thiol-containing compounds.<br>
[0029] The invention also provides methods of producing conjugates between<br>
a bioactive compound and a monofunctionally activated polyalkylene glycol,<br>
for example comprising: (a) obtaining or preparing a linear or branched<br>
polyalkylene glycol comprising at least one unreactive blocking group that can<br>
be subsequently removed, such as one or more triphenylmethyi groups ("frityl<br>
groups"); (b) producing a derivative of the polyalkylene glycol by reacting it<br>
with at least one derivatizing compound under conditions such that the<br>
polyalkylene glycol is derivatized with one derivatizing group (such as one<br><br>
carboxyl group) at an end that lacks the blocking group(s); (c) removing the<br>
blocking group(s) without removing the derivatizing group to produce, in one<br>
or more steps, a monofunctionally activated polyalkylene glycol; and<br>
(d) contacting the monofunctionally activated polyalkylene glycol with at least<br>
one bioactive component under conditions that favor the covalent binding of<br>
the bioactive component to the monofunctionally activated polyalkylene<br>
glycol. Preferably, the conjugates produced by such methods are of reduced,<br>
substantially reduced or undetectable antigenicity and immunogenicity, when<br>
compared to conjugates derivatized to the same extent with mPEG of similar<br>
size, structure and linkage to the bioactive agent. The invention also provides<br>
conjugates produced by such methods.<br>
[0030] The invention also provides pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions<br>
comprising the conjugates of the invention and at least one excipient or carrier<br>
that is acceptable for pharmaceutical or veterinary use.<br>
[0031] In additional embodiments, the invention also provides methods of<br>
preventing, diagnosing or treating physical disorders in animals (such as<br>
mammals, including humans) using the conjugates or compositions of the<br>
invention. One such method comprises, for example, administering to an<br>
animal suffering from or predisposed to a physical disorder (such as anemia,<br>
arthritis, cancers, Alzheimer's disease, enzymatic deficiencies, cardiovascular<br>
disease, hypertension, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases, neurologic<br>
diseases, neutropenia, hyperuricemia and manifestations thereof (e.g., gout),<br>
genetic deficiency diseases or disorders, and the like) an effective amount of<br>
one or more of the conjugates or compositions of the invention, which may be<br>
administered to the animal, especially mammals and most especially humans,<br>
orally, topically or parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly or<br>
subcutaneously.<br>
[0032] In additional embodiments, the invention provides compositions<br>
comprising one or more of the conjugates of reduced antigenicity of the<br>
invention that may further comprise one or more additional components or<br>
reagents, such as one or more buffer salts, one or more carbohydrate<br>
excipients, one or more carrier proteins, one or more enzymes, one or more<br>
detergents, one or more nucleic acid molecules, one or more polymers such as<br><br>
PEG, and the like. The invention also provides kits composing the conjugates<br>
of reduced antigenicity and/or compositions of the invention.<br>
[0033] In additional embodiments, the invention provides PEG-liposomes of<br>
reduced immunoreactivity prepared using monofunctionally activated poly<br>
alkylene glycols that lack methoxyl or other alkoxyl groups, rather than<br>
monofunctionally activated mPEG. Other preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in light of the<br>
following drawings and description of the invention, and of the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0034] Figure 1 displays the results from a competitive enzyme-linked<br>
immimosorbent assay ("ELISA") analysis. In this assay, an mPEG conjugate<br>
of one protein was bound to the 96-well assay plate, and the inhibition of<br>
binding of rabbit antibodies to an mPEG conjugate of another protein by<br>
solutions of mPEG or t- butoxyPEG was measured.<br>
[0035] Figure 2a displays the results from a competitive ELISA, performed<br>
as described for Figure 1, using PEGs of various sizes and structures<br>
containing either one or two methoxyl groups. The results for antibody<br>
binding are graphed as a function of the molar concentration of methoxyl<br>
groups in each sample.<br>
[0036] Figure 2b displays the same data as Figure 2a, graphed as a function<br>
of the weight concentration of PEG (microgram/mL) instead of the molar<br>
concentration of methoxyl groups.<br>
[0037] Figure 3 displays some of the data from Figures 1, 2a and 2b in a<br>
format that demonstrates the direct dependence of antigenicity on the number<br>
of methoxyl groups per molecule of PEG. These samples include 10-kDa<br>
PEGs, one of which lacks a methoxyl group (t-butoxyPEG), one that contains<br>
one methoxyl group (mPEG) and one that contains two methoxyl groups<br>
[Di-(5-kDa) mPEG-lysine].<br>
[0038] Figure 4 illustrates a competitive ELISA, as described for Figure 1, in<br>
which 4.8-kDa mPEG is compared with three PEGs of the invention that have<br>
no methoxyl groups at the ends of the linear polymer (labeled "PharmaPEG")-<br>
The shift between the curves on the horizontal axis indicates that the<br><br>
antigenicities of all three of the PEGs of the invention are approximately 100-<br>
fold lower than that of mPEG, when assayed with anti-mPEG antibodies.<br>
[0039] Figure 5a displays the results of studies in which samples of an isomer<br>
of carbonic anhydrase ("CA II") and the same carbonic anliydrase coupled to<br>
an average of 3-4 strands of .5-kDa mPEG were analyzed by polyacrylamide<br>
gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate ("SDS-PAGE").<br>
Lanes 1 and 2 of the gel show the results obtained by staining for protein using<br>
SYPRO® brand Ruby stain and photography in a dark hood with illumination<br>
at 302 nm. Lanes 3 and 4 show the results of a Western blot of the mPEG<br>
conjugates and the unPEGylated enzyme, respectively, in which polyclonal<br>
rabbit anti-mPEG antibodies were used as the primary antibodies. Lane 5<br>
shows the positions of pre-stained protein standards.<br>
[0040] Figure 5b shows the quantitation of the band intensities m the gel and<br>
the Western blot shown in Figure 5a, obtained with Kodak camera and digital<br>
imaging software. The horizontal axis represents the migration distance<br>
relative to the dye front and the vertical axis represents the relative intensities<br>
of the protein stain or anti-mPEG stain. The bottom tracing shows bands of<br>
pre-stained standard proteins with apparent molecular weights, from left to<br>
right, of 203.8, 110.9, 68.8, 51.5, 40.2, 28.9, 20.7 and 14.9 kDa. The second<br>
tracing from the bottom is an anti-mPEG antibody stain of PEGylated<br>
carbonic anhydrase. The third tracmg from the bottom represents the protein-<br>
stained band of carbonic anhydrase and the top tracing represents the protein-<br>
stained bands of the mPEG conjugates of carbonic anhydrase.<br>
[0041] Figures 6a and 6b show the results of ELISA analyses of sera from<br>
groups of three rabbits that were immunized with conjugates of porcine<br>
uricase containing an average of about two strands of either mPEG or<br>
hydroxyPEG ("PharmaPEG") per uricase subunit Antibodies against uricase<br>
were measured using assay plates coated with porcine uricase. Antibodies<br>
against PEG were measured using plates coated with conjugates of an<br>
unrelated protein coupled to mPEG. Fig. 6a shows data from the second<br>
bleeding of rabbits that had received four injections of PEG-uricase in<br>
incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Fig. 6b shows data from the third bleeding of<br>
the same rabbits after they had received five mjections of PEG-uricase in<br>
incomplete Freund's adjuvant.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0042] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br>
have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials<br>
similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or<br>
testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are<br>
described hereinafter.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0043] About: As used herein when referring to any numerical value, the term<br>
"about" means a value of ±10% of the stated value (e.g., "about 50°C"<br>
encompasses a range of temperatures from 45°C to 55°C, inclusive; similarly,<br>
"about 100 mM" encompasses a range of concentrations from 90 mM to<br>
110 mM inclusive).<br>
[0044] Bioactive Component: As used herein, the term "bioactive<br>
component" refers to a compound, molecule, moiety or complex that has a<br>
particular biological activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo upon a cell, tissue,<br>
organ or organism, and that is capable of being bound to one or more<br>
polyalkylene glycols to form the conjugates of the invention. Preferred<br>
bioactive components are described in detail below.<br>
[0045] Bound: As used herein, the term "bound" refers to binding or<br>
attachment that may be covalent, e.g., by chemically coupling, or non-<br>
covalent, e.g., ionic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds,<br>
etc. Covalent bonds can be, for example, ester, ether, phosphoester, thioester,<br>
thioether, urethane, amide, peptide, imide, carbon-sulfur bonds, carbon-<br>
phosphorus bonds, and the like. The term "bound" is broader than and<br>
includes terms such as "coupled," "linked" and "attached."<br>
[00461 Coupled: The term "coupled", as used herein, refers to attachment by<br>
covalent bonds or by strong non-covalent interactions, typically and preferably<br>
to attachment by covalent bonds. Any method normally used by those skilled<br>
in the art for the coupling of biologically active materials can be used in the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
[0047] Disease, disorder, condition: As used herein, the terms "disease" or<br>
"disorder" refer to any adverse condition of a human or animal including<br>
tumors, cancers, allergies, addiction, autoimmunity, poisoning or impairment<br>
of optimal mental or bodily function. "Conditions" as used herein includes<br>
diseases and disorders but also refers to physiologic states. For example,<br>
fertility is a physiologic state but not a disease or disorder. Compositions of<br>
the invention suitable for preventing pregnancy by decreasing fertility would<br>
therefore be described as a treatment of a condition (fertility), but not a<br>
treatment of a disorder or disease. Other conditions are understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0048] Effective Amount: As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers<br>
to an amount of a given conjugate or composition that is necessary or<br>
sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. An effective amount of a given<br>
conjugate or composition of the present invention would be the amount that<br>
achieves this selected result, and such an amount could be determined as a<br>
matter of routine by a person skilled in the art. For example, an effective<br>
amount for treating an immune system deficiency could be that amount<br>
necessary to cause activation of the immune system, resulting in the<br>
development of an antigen-specific immune response upon exposure to an<br>
antigen. The term is also synonymous with "sufficient amount." the<br>
effective amount for any particular application can vary depending on such<br>
factors as the disease or condition being treated, the particular composition<br>
being administered, the size of the subject, and/or the severity of the disease or<br>
condition. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine empirically the<br>
effective amount of a particular conjugate or composition of the present<br>
invention without necessitating undue experimentation.<br>
[00491 Immune response: As used herein, the term "immune response" refers<br>
to a humoral immme response (i.e., the formation of antibodies) and/or a<br>
cellular immune response leading to the activation or proliferation of B-<br>
and/or T-lymphocytes and/or antigen-presenting cells. In some instances,<br>
however, the immune responses may be of low intensity and become<br>
detectable only when using at least one substance in accordance with the<br>
invention. "Immunogenic" refers to an agent that is capable of stimulating the<br><br>
immune system of a living organism, so that one or more functions of the<br>
immune system are increased and directed towards the immunogenic agent.<br>
[0050] One, a, or an: When the terms "one," "a," or "an" are used m this<br>
disclosure, they mean "at least one" or "one or more," unless otherwise<br>
indicated.<br>
[0051] Polypeptide: As used herein, the term "polypeptide" refers to a<br>
molecule composed of monomers (amino acids) linearly linked by amide<br>
bonds (also known as peptide bonds). It indicates a molecular chain of amino<br>
acids and does not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, dipeptides,<br>
tripeptides, oligopeptides, peptides of unspecified length and proteins are<br>
included within the definition of polypeptide. This term is also intended to<br>
refer to the products of post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for<br>
example, glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation and the like. A<br>
polypeptide may be recombmant or derived from a natural biological source,<br>
but is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It<br>
may be generated in any manner, including by chemical synthesis.<br>
[0052] Protein and glycoprotein: As used herein, the term protein refers to a<br>
polypeptide generally of a size of above about 5 or more, 10 or more, 20 or<br>
more, 25 or more, 50 or more, 75 or more, 100 or more, 200 or more, 500 or<br>
more, 1,000 or more or 2,000 or more amino acids. Proteins generally have a<br>
defined three-dimensional structure, although they do not necessarily need to,<br>
and are often referred to as folded, as opposed to peptides and polypeptides,<br>
which often do not possess a defined three-dimensional structure, but rather<br>
can adopt a large number of different conformations, and are referred to as<br>
unfolded. Peptides may, however, also have a defined three-dimensional<br>
structure. As used herein, the term glycoprotein refers to a protein containing<br>
at least one sugar moiety attached to the protein via an oxygen-containing or a<br>
nitrogen-containing side chain of an amino acid, e.g., serine or asparagine.<br>
[0053] Purified: As used herein, when the term "purified" is used in reference<br>
to a molecule, it means that the concentration of the molecule being purified<br>
has been increased relative to molecules associated with it in its natural<br>
environment, or the environment in which it was produced, found or<br>
synthesized. Naturally associated molecules include proteins, nucleic acids,<br>
lipids and sugars, but generally do not include water, buffers, and reagents<br><br>
added to maintain the integrity or facilitate the purification of the molecule<br>
being purified. For example, even if a given protein in a crude extract is<br>
diluted with an aqueous solvent during column chromatography, protein<br>
molecules are considered to be purified by this chromatography if naturally<br>
associated nucleic acids, non-desired proteins and other biological molecules<br>
are separated from the subject protein molecules. According to this definition,<br>
a substance may be 5% or more, 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more,<br>
40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or<br>
more, 95% or more, 98% or more, 99% or more, or 100% pure when<br>
considered relative to its contaminants.<br>
[0054] Residue: As used herein, the term "residue" refers to a specific amino<br>
acid, usually dehydrated as a result of its involvement in one or more peptide<br>
bonds, in a polypeptide backbone or side chain.<br>
[0055] Treatment: As used herein, the terms "treatment," "treat," "treated" or<br>
"treating" refer to prophylaxis and/or therapy. When used with respect to an<br>
infectious disease, for example, the term may refer to a prophylactic treatment<br>
that increases the resistance of a subject to infection with a pathogen or, in<br>
other words, decreases the likelihood that the subject will become infected<br>
with the pathogen or will show signs of illness attributable to the infection, as<br>
well as a treatment after the subject has become infected in order to fight the<br>
infection, e.g., to reduce or eliminate the infection or to prevent it from<br>
becoming worse.<br>
Overview<br>
[0056] A number of previous investigators have disclosed the preparation of<br>
linear or branched non-antigenic PEG polymers or conjugates thereof (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,428,128; 5,621,039; 5,622,986; 5,643,575; 5,728,560;<br>
5,730,990; 5,738,846; 5,811,076; 5,824,701; 5,840,900; 5,880,131; 5,900,402;<br>
5,902,588; 5,919,455; 5,951,974; 5,965,119; 5,965,566; 5,969,040; 5,981,709;<br>
6,011,042; 6,042,822; 6,113,906; 6,127,355; 6,132,713; 6,177,087, and<br>
6,180,095; see also PCT publication WO 95/13090 and published U.S. patent<br>
application nos, 2002/0052443, 2002/0061307 and 2002/0098192; the<br>
disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entireties). However, the PEG and the conjugates in these previous reports<br><br>
remain at least weakly immunogenic, which can lead to the undesirable<br>
consequence of the development of antibodies to the PEG component of the<br>
conjugates when the conjugates are introduced into an animal for prophylactic,<br>
diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Such antibodies may lead to a rapid<br>
clearing of PEG-containing bioactive conjugates, thereby reducing the<br>
bioavailability of the therapeutic compositions (Cheng, T.-L., et al. (1999),<br>
supra), as well as possibly inducing an immune-complex mediated disorder.<br>
Moreover, as yet there has been no disclosure of a mechanism for rendering<br>
the claimed PEGs or conjugates thereof substantially non-antigenic or non-<br>
immunogenic.<br>
[0057] The present invention has overcome these limitations in the art. In<br>
general, the invention provides stable compositions and methods useful in the<br>
prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a variety of physical disorders. More<br>
particularly, the invention provides methods for producing reactive polymers<br>
of reduced antigenicity and stabilized polymer conjugates of proteins,<br>
particularly therapeutic proteins, which have reduced or substantially reduced<br>
antigenicity or which have undetectable antigenicity, In other embodiments,<br>
the invention provides conjugates produced by these methods of the invention,<br>
and compositions, particularly pharmaceutical compositions, comprising such<br>
conjugates. In additional embodiments, the invention provides methods of use<br>
of such conjugates and compositions in preventing, diagnosing and treating a<br>
variety of physical disorders. The invention also provides kits comprising one<br>
or more of the conjugates and/or compositions of the invention.<br>
Preparation of Conjugates of Reduced Antigenicity<br>
[0058] In one aspect, the present invention provides methods for preparing<br>
conjugates of reduced antigenicity, substantially reduced antigenicity, or<br>
undetectable antigenicity, by the covalent attachment of water-soluble<br>
polymers to one or more bioactive compounds or components, such as one or<br>
more proteins and particularly one or more therapeutic proteins. In such<br>
conjugates, the polymers chosen will themselves be of reduced antigenicity,<br>
substantially reduced antigenicity or undetectable antigenicity, compared to<br>
standard polymers typically used for preparing protein-polymer conjugates.<br>
As used herein, the term "reduced antigenicity" refers to a polymer (e.g., a<br><br>
PAO or PAG, particularly a PEG, and most particularly a monofunctionally<br>
activated PEG), or a conjugate or composition comprising or synthesized<br>
using such a polymer, wherein the ability of the polymer to react with<br>
antibodies formed against more antigenic polymers (e.g., mPEG) has been<br>
reduced by any amount. Preferably, the antigenicity is reduced by at least<br>
about 30%, more preferably reduced by at least about 50%, and most<br>
preferably reduced by more than about 75% compared to the more antigenic<br>
polymer. By extension, then, a polymer (or conjugate or composition<br>
comprising or synthesized using such a polymer) is said to be of "substantially<br>
reduced antigenicity" if the polymer (or conjugate or composition) has about<br>
or less than 20%, more preferably about or less than 15%, still more preferably<br>
about or less than 10%, and most preferably about or less than 1%, of the<br>
antigenicity of the corresponding antigenic polymer (e.g., mPEG). Finally, a<br>
polymer (or conjugate or composition comprising or synthesized using such a<br>
polymer) is said to have "no detectable antigenicity" if the polymer, conjugate<br>
or composition has no detectable antigenicity when assayed with art-known<br>
methods (e.g., ELISA or other methods of detecting antigenicity, such as those<br>
known in the art and as described in the Examples herein).<br>
Polymers<br>
[0059] Polyalkylene glycols that are particularly suitable for use in preparing<br>
the conjugates of the invention include, but are not limited to, poly(ethylene<br>
glycols), and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide; particularly<br>
preferred are PEGs, and more particularly preferred are monofunctionally<br>
activated hydroxyPEGs (e.g., hydroxyPEGs activated at a single terminus,<br>
including reactive esters of hydroxyPEG-monocarboxylic acids, hydroxyPEG-<br>
monoaldehydes, hydroxyPEG-monoamines, hydroxyPEG-monohydrazides,<br>
hydroxyPEG-monocarbazates, hydroxyPEG-monoiodoacetamides, hydroxy-<br>
PEG-monomaleimides, hydroxyPEG-monoorthopyridyl disulfides, hydroxy-<br>
PEG-monooximes, hydroxyPEG-monophenyl carbonates, hydroxyPEG-<br>
monophenyl glyoxals, hydroxyPEG-monothiazolidine-2-thiones, hydroxy-<br>
PEG-monothioesters, hydroxyPEG-monothiols, hydroxyPEG-monotriazines<br>
and hydroxyPEG-monovinylsulfones).<br><br>
[0060] Particularly preferred polymers for use in preparing the conjugates of<br>
the present invention, which have reduced antigenicity, substantially reduced<br>
antigenicity, or no detectable antigenicity, are monofunctionally activated<br>
PEGs that do not contain methoxyl groups, other alkoxyl groups or aryloxyl<br>
groups. The substitution of such monofunctionally activated PEGs in place of<br>
monoiunctionally activated mPEG in the synthesis of conjugates of the<br>
invention confers on the resulting conjugates an unexpectedly decreased<br>
antigenicity, i.e., a decreased ability to interact with antibodies developed<br>
against mPEG conjugates of the same bioactive component. The resultant<br>
conjugates also have decreased immunogenicity, i.e., decreased ability to<br>
evoke an immune response.<br>
[0061] In one aspect of the invention, monofunctionally activated PEGs can<br>
be synthesized by using suitable reversibly blocked derivatives of the<br>
activating group as an initiator for polymerization of ethylene oxide<br>
(Akiyama, Y., et al. (2000) Biocoming Chem, J 1:941-950). Akiyama et al.<br>
provide conditions for the synthesis of a monohydroxyl, monoacetal derivative<br>
of PEG by using potassium 3,3-diethoxypropanolate as the initiator for<br>
polymerization of ethylene oxide. Since Akiyama et al. did not recognize the<br>
most desirably reduced antigenicity or immunogenicity of this intermediate,<br>
they proceeded to convert the terminal hydroxyl group to a thiol by<br>
terminating the polymerization by the addition of methanesulfonyl chloride,<br>
thereby producing a heterobifunctional PEG, instead of a PEG derivative of<br>
this invention. As further evidence that this group of workers did not<br>
recognize the utility of a hydroxyl terminated monofunctionally activated<br>
PEG, they have published and patented methods for synthesis of alternative<br>
heterobifunctional PEGs from monohydroxyl, monofunctionally activated<br>
PEGs and in some cases have even "end-capped" the hydroxyPEGs with<br>
methoxyl groups. Similarly, Bentley, M.D., et al, in published U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 2002/0072573 Al, disclose polymer compositions and<br>
methods that reflect no recognition of the immunologic advantage of<br>
hydroxyl-terminated monofunctionally activated polymers and teach the<br>
desirability of converting the terminal hydroxyl groups of such polymers to<br>
methoxyl groups.<br><br>
[0062] In an alternative aspect of the present invention, mono functionally<br>
activated PEGs can be synthesized by controlling the extent of activation of<br>
linear PEGs containing hydroxyl groups at both ends ("PEG diols") in order to<br>
limit the amount of bis-activated PEG to an acceptably low level, e.g.. 
preferably 
shown in Example 5. In a particularly preferred aspect, monofunctionally<br>
activated PEGs can be synthesized from monofunctional PEGs from which an<br>
unreactive blocking group can be removed following the derivatization of the<br>
PEG, without removing the derivatizing group. An example of a derivatized<br>
PEG is a PEG-carboxylic acid and examples of unreactive blocking groups<br>
that can be removed following derivatization are aryloxyl groups (Bentley,<br>
M.D., etal, PCT publication WO 01/26692 Al), trityl groups (Kocienski,<br>
P.J., (1994) Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, pp. 54-58),<br>
and t-butoxyl groups. The t-butoxyPEG-carboxylic acid can be activated, e.g.,<br>
with N-hydroxysuccinimide. Finally, the t-butoxyl group can be removed by<br>
anhydrous acidolysis to produce an activated PEG carboxylic acid derivative<br>
that has a hydroxyl group, instead of a methoxyl group at the distal end of the<br>
polymer. In a more preferred embodiment, the r-butoxyPEG-carboxylic acid<br>
can be converted to hydroxyPEG-carboxylic acid by acidolysis prior to<br>
activation of the carboxyl group with N-hydroxysuccinimide. In another<br>
embodiment of this invention, t-butoxyPEG-acetals are synthesized by<br>
contacting t-butoxyPEG with a haloacetal and converting the product to a<br>
hydroxyPEG-acetal or hydroxyPEG-aldehyde by selective anhydrous<br>
acidolysis to remove the t-butoxyl group. The acetal may be converted to an<br>
aldehyde (or an aldehyde hydrate) in preparation for its coupling to an amine-<br>
containing compound by reductive alkylation (Bentley, M.D., et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,990,237). In another embodiment, an aryloxyl protecting group<br>
that is distal from the reactive terminus of the polymer can be removed by<br>
catalytic hydrogenolysis, thereby producing a monoactivated hydroxyPAG of<br>
this invention. Alternatively, reversible blocking of all except one of the<br>
terminal hydroxyl groups, as described in Example 6, can be employed in the<br>
synthesis of monofunctionally activated hydroxyPAGs.<br>
[0063] The PAG polymers used in preparing the conjugates of the present<br>
invention may be linear polymers, or may be branched at one or more points<br><br>
within the polymer molecule. In addition, the polymers used to form the<br>
conjugates of the invention may be homopolymers, in which multiple units of<br>
a single monomer type are linked together to form the polymer, such as<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) or they may be heteropolymers or copolymers (in which<br>
monomeric units of two or more structures are linked together to form the<br>
polymer, such as a copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide). Such<br>
copolymers may be random copolymers, block copolymers or alternating<br>
copolymers.<br>
[0064] Polymers used in accordance with the invention may be unreactive<br>
polymers or reactive polymers. As used herein, "unreactive polymers" are<br>
those polymers that will not attach covalently to a protein. Examples of such<br>
"unreactive polymers" include, but are not limited to, mPEG, which is a linear<br>
polymer of ethylene oxide units with a hydroxyl group at one end and a<br>
methoxyl group at the other end, and PEG diol, which is a linear polymer of<br>
ethylene oxide units with hydroxyl groups at both ends. As used herein,<br>
"reactive polymers" are those polymers that can react with solvent-accessible<br>
nucleophilic groups, e.g., thiol groups or amino groups on a bioactive<br>
component (such as a protein), including but not limited to the alpha amino<br>
group or the epsilon amino groups of lysine residues. Examples of "reactive<br>
polymers" include, but are not limited to, PEGs in which a hydroxyl end group<br>
has been converted to or replaced by an electrophilic group, such as<br>
succinimidyl propionic acid (as in "SPA-PEG") or a P-nitrophenyl carbonate<br>
(as in "NPC-PEG"), or an aldehyde as in PEG-aldehyde. In addition to<br>
polyalkylene oxides, suitable polymers may include polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
poly(oxyethylene-oxymethylene) copolymers, polyamides (e.g.. Rose, K.,<br>
PCX publication WO 00/12587), polycarboxylates, poly(vinylpyrrolidones)<br>
(von Specht, B.-U., et al. (1973) Hoppe-Seyler's Z Physiol Chem 354:1659-<br>
1660), poly D-amino acids and/or poly /--amino acids, polyacryloyl-<br>
morpholine (Rocca, M., et al. (1996) Int J Artif Organs 19:730~734) and<br>
dextrans (Iakunitskaya, L.M., et al. (1980) Prikl Biokhim Mikrobiol 16:232-<br>
237). Derivatives of PEGs, PEOs and other PAOs that react more or less<br>
selectively with various sites on the target bioactive components are well<br>
known in the art and can be purchased from suppliers such as Fluka<br><br>
(Milwaukee, WI); NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan); Shearwater Corporation<br>
(HuntsvilJe, AL), a subsidiary of Nektar Therapeutics (San Carlos, CA);<br>
Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO) or SunBio, lac. (Anyang City,<br>
South Korea).<br>
[0065] Activated forms of polymers that are suitable for use in the methods<br>
and compositions of this invention can include any hydroxyl terminated,<br>
monofunctionally active forms of polymers that are known in the art. For<br>
example, linear and branched PAOs of various sizes are suitable, including<br>
those with molecular weights (excluding the mass of the activating group) in<br>
the range of about 1 kDa to about 100 kDa. Suitable ranges of molecular<br>
weights include but are not limited to about 2 kDa to about 60 kDa; about<br>
2 kDa to about 30 kDa; about 5 kDa to about 20 kDa; about 10 kDa to about<br>
20 kDa; and about 18 kDa to about 60 kDa, about 20 kDa or about 30 kDa. In<br>
the case of linear PEGs, the molecular weight range of about 20 kDa to about<br>
30 kDa corresponds to a degree of polymerization (n) in the range of about<br>
450 to about 680 monomeric units of ethylene oxide. It should be noted that<br>
the advantages of coupling a therapeutic protein to polymers having this latter<br>
relatively high range of molecular weights (i.e., &gt;20-30 kDa) were first<br>
observed long before the immunogenicity of mPEG was recognized (Saifer,<br>
M., et al. PCT publication WO 89/01033, published Feb. 9, 1989, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[0066] Optionally, a linear polymer can have a reactive group at one end or<br>
both ends, thereby creating a "reactive polymer." In certain embodiments of<br>
this invention, it can be desirable to use the succinimidyl ester of the<br>
monopropionic acid derivative of PEG, as disclosed in Harris, J.M., et al,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,672,662, which is incorporated herein fully by reference, or<br>
other succinimide activated PEG-carboxylic acids. In certain other<br>
embodiments, it can be desirable to use either the succinimidyl carbonate<br>
derivatives of PEG ("SC-PEG"), as described in Saifer, M., et al., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,006,333; 5,080,891; 5,283,317 and 5,468,478, or the P-nitrophenyl<br>
carbonate derivative of PEG, as disclosed in Kelly, S.J., et al. (2001) supra;<br>
PCT publication WO 00/07629 .A2, supra and corresponding U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,576,235, and in PCT pubHcation WO 01/59078 A2 supra. Moreover, other<br><br>
types of reactive groups can be used to synthesize polymer conjugates of<br>
proteins. These derivatives include, but are not limited to, aldehyde<br>
derivatives of PEGs (Royer, G.P., U.S. Patent No. 4,002,531; Harris, J.M,,<br>
et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,252,714), amine, bromophenyl carbonate,<br>
carbonylimidazole, chlorophenyl carbonate, fluorophenyl carbonate,<br>
hydrazide, carbazate, iodoacetamide, maleimide, orthopyridyl disulfide,<br>
oxime, phenylglyoxal, thiazolidine-2-thione, ibioester, thiol, triazine and<br>
vinylsulfone derivatives of PEGs.<br>
[0067] In certain embodiments of the invention, it is desirable to minimize the<br>
formation of intramolecular and intermolecular cross-links by polymers such<br>
as PEG during the reaction in which the polymer is coupled to the bioactive<br>
component to produce the conjugates of the invention. This can be<br>
accomplished by using polymers that are activated at only one end (referred to<br>
herein as "monofunctionally activated PEGs" or "monofunctionally activated<br>
PAGs") or polymer preparations in which the percentage of bifunctionally<br>
activated polymers (referred to in the case of linear PEGs as "bis-activated<br>
PEG diols") is less than 30%, or more preferably less than 10% or most<br>
preferably less than 2%(w/w). The use of activated polymers that are<br>
predominantly monofimctional can minimize the formation of all of the<br>
following: intramolecular cross links within an individual protein molecule,<br>
"dumbbell" structures, in which one strand of polymer connects two protein<br>
molecules, and larger aggregates or gels. When activated polymers that react<br>
with amino groups are used, the theoretical maximum number of strands of<br>
polymer that can be attached to one molecule of protein corresponds to the<br>
total number of amino groups. The actual number of amino groups that are<br>
accessible on the surface of a protein under any particular conditions of<br>
polymer coupling may be smaller than the theoretical maximum.<br>
[0068] Conjugates of the invention may comprise one or more strands of<br>
polyalkylene glycol, preferably from about one to about 100 strands, from<br>
about one to about 20 strands per subunit of therapeutic enzymes, and from<br>
about one to about three strands, and more preferably from about one to about<br>
two strands per subunit of receptor-binding cytokines, growth factors, protein<br>
hormones and colony stimulating factors. In a particularly preferred such<br><br>
embodiment, the polyalkylene glycol used in preparing the conjugate<br>
comprises one or two strands of poly(ethylene glycol) (particularly a<br>
carboxyPEG, an hydroxyPEG, a dihydroxyPEG or a PEG-acetal). In certain<br>
such embodiments, the linear or branched polyalkylene glycol has a molecular<br>
weight of from about 1 kDa to about 100 kDa, preferably about 2 kDa to about<br>
60 kDa; about 5 kDa to about 20 kDa; about 10 kDa to about 20 kDa; about<br>
18 kDa to about 60 kDa; and most preferably about 18 kDa to about 22 kDa or<br>
about 27 kDa to about 33 kDa, if linear, and a total of about 36 kDa to about<br>
44 kDa, if the polymer has two branches of equal mass.<br>
Bioactive Components<br>
[0069] As noted above, the conjugates of the invention comprise one or more<br>
PAGs or PAOs, and particularly one or more strands of PEG, covalently<br>
attached to one or more bioactive components. Bioactive components to<br>
which one or more polymers (or strands thereof) have been covalently<br>
attached are referred to herein variously and equivalently as "conjugated<br>
bioactive components" or "modified bioactive components." These terms are<br>
to be distinguished herein from "unconjugated bioactive components," "initial<br>
bioactive components" or "unmodified bioactive components," all of which<br>
terms refer to bioactive components that have not had one or more polymers<br>
covalently attached thereto. In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
methods and compositions for stabilizing solutions of bioactive components<br>
by the admixture of polymers thereto. It is to be understood, however, that an<br>
"unconjugated," "unmodified" or "initial" bioactive component may contain<br>
other, non-polymer conjugations or modifications when compared to a wild<br>
type or native molecule, and would still be considered to be "imconjugated,"<br>
"unmodified" or "initial" in accordance with the present invention, since the<br>
bioactive component would be "unconjugated," "unmodified" or "initial" with<br>
respect to the attachment of polymers.<br>
[0070] The term "stabilizing" a bioactive component (or "methods of<br>
stabilization" or "stabilized bioactive component") indicates that a bioactive<br>
component has been stabilized according to the methods of this invention (i.e..<br>
a bioactive component to which a polymer has been covalently attached or<br>
admixed according to the methods of the invention). Such stabilized bioactive<br><br>
components will exhibit certain altered biochemical and biophysical<br>
characteristics when compared to a bioactive component that has not been<br>
stabilized (i.e., a bioactive component to which a polymer has not been<br>
covalently attached or admixed). Included among such altered biochemical<br>
and biophysical parameters, particularly for proteins such as enzymes, may be<br>
decreased autolysis and particularly the maintenance of the enzymatic activity<br>
of a protein during incubation under certain harsh environmental or<br>
experimental conditions. In certain embodiments of the invention, the altered<br>
biochemical and biophysical parameters may include, for example, an<br>
increased half-life in the circulation in vivo, increased bioavailability, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0071] Any component (typically a molecule or macromolecular complex)<br>
having biological (i.e., physiological, biochemical or pharmaceutical) activity<br>
can be suitably used as an initial component in the present invention. Such<br>
bioactive components include, but are not limited to, proteins, polypeptides,<br>
peptides, therapeutic viruses, organic compounds, and the like. Bioactive<br>
components also include fragments,, variants and derivatives of such proteins,<br>
polypeptides, peptides, therapeutic viruses, organic compounds and the like,<br>
particularly such fragments, variants and derivatives having biological (i.e.,<br>
physiological, biochemical or phannaceutical) activity.<br>
[0072] Suitable organic compounds useful as bioactive components in the<br>
present invention include, without limitation, moieties such as taxanes,<br>
anthracycline, compoimds including daunorubicin, doxorubicin,<br>
P-aminoaniline mustard, melphalan, cytosine arabinoside ("Ara-C") and other<br>
anti-metabolic compounds, e.g., gemcitabine, etc. Alternatively, the bioactive<br>
component can be a cardiovascular agent, anti-neoplastic, anti-infective, anti-<br>
fungal such as nystatin and amphotericin B, anti-anxiety agent, gastrointestinal<br>
agent, an agent active in the central nervous system, analgesic, fertility agent,,<br>
contraceptive agent, anti-inflammatory agent, steroidal agent, anti-uricemic<br>
agent, vasodilating agent, vasoconstricting agent, and the like.<br>
[0073] Suitable peptides, polypeptides, enzymes and other proteins,<br>
glycoproteins and the like that are useful as bioactive components in the<br>
present invention include any peptide, polypeptide, enzyme or other protein,<br>
etc., having at least one available amino group, thiol group or other group to<br><br>
which polymers can be attached. Such components include materials that<br>
have physiological or pharmacological activities, as well as those that are able<br>
to catalyze reactions in organic solvents. Peptides, polypeptides and proteins<br>
of interest include, but are not limited to, hemoglobin, serum proteins such as<br>
blood-clotting factors, e.g.. Factors VII, VIII, and DC, immunoglobulins,<br>
insulin, cytokines such as interleukins, e.g., IL-1 through IL-18, interferons<br>
(e.g., IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and consensus IFN), colony<br>
stimulating factors including without limitation GM-CSF, G-CSF,<br>
macrophage colony stimulating factor, thrombopoietin, megakaryocyte growth<br>
and development factor, erythropoietin, platelet derived growth factor,<br>
phospholipase-activating protein ("FLAP"), leukemia inhibitory factor ("LIF,"<br>
also known in the art as "Steel Factor"), neurotrophic factors and stem cell<br>
factor and peptide mimetics thereof. Receptor-binding antagonists of<br>
bioactive agents are themselves suitable for use as bioactive components of<br>
the present invention. Other proteins of general biological or therapeutic<br>
interest include insulin, plant proteins such as lectins and ricins, tumor<br>
necrosis factors and related proteins, growth factors such as transforming<br>
growth factors, e.g., TGF-alpha or TGF-beta, fibroblast growth factors,<br>
epidermal growth factors, ,hepatocyte growth factors, hormones,<br>
somatomedins, erythropoietin, pigmentary hormones, hypothalamic releasing<br>
factors, antidiuretic hormones, prolactin, chorionic gonadotropin, follicle-<br>
stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, tissue<br>
plasminogen activator, receptor-binding protein antagonists thereof, and the<br>
like. Many such proteins exist in both glycosylated and non-glycosylated<br>
forms. The non-glycosylated forms may result from their production using<br>
recombinant techniques in prokaryotes. Such non-glycosylated products are<br>
among the peptides and proteins that are suitable bioactive components of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0074] Enzymes of interest include carbohydrate-specific enzymes,<br>
proteolytic enzymes, oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases,<br>
isomerases and ligases. Without being limited to particular enzymes,<br>
examples of enzymes of interest include asparaginase, arginase, arginine<br>
deiminase, adenosine deaminase, superoxide dismutase, endotoxinases,<br>
catalase, chymotrypsin, lipases, uncases, adenosine diphosphatase, tyrosinases<br><br>
and bilirubin oxidase. Carbohydrate-specific enzymes of interest include<br>
glucose oxidases, glucosidases, galactosidases, glucocerebrosidases,<br>
glucuronidases and the like.<br>
[0075] Also suitable for use as a bioactive component in the conjugates of the<br>
present invention is any compound demonstrating bioactivity in vivo. Such<br>
compounds include, without limitation, amino acid sequences, nucleic acids<br>
(DNA, RNA), peptide nucleic acids ("PNAs"), antibody fragments, single-<br>
chain binding proteins (see, e.g., Ladner, R.C., et al, U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,946,778, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference),<br>
binding molecules including soluble receptors, polyclonal antibodies,<br>
monoclonal antibodies, catalytic antibodies and the products of fusion of<br>
antibodies or fragments thereof.<br>
[0076] The proteins or portions thereof can be prepared or isolated by using<br>
techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as chemical<br>
synthesis, cell, tissue or organ culture, extraction from animal sources, or by<br>
recombinant DNA methodologies. Transgenic sources of the amino acid<br>
sequences, polypeptides and proteins and the like are also contemplated. Such<br>
materials can be obtained from transgenic animals, e.g., mice, rabbits, pigs,<br>
goats and cows, wherein the proteins are expressed in milk, blood or tissues,<br>
or in the eggs of transgenic birds. Transgenic insects and fungal or<br>
baculovirus expression systems are also contemplated as sources. Moreover,<br>
mutant versions of proteins are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0077] Other proteins of interest are allergenic proteins such as ragweed,<br>
Antigen E, honeybee venom, mite allergen and the like. The foregoing are<br>
illustrative of the proteins that are suitable for the present invention. It is to be<br>
understood that other peptides, polypeptides or proteins, or fragments thereof,<br>
that are not specifically mentioned herein but that have one or more available<br>
amino groups or thiol groups suitable for coupling with one or more polymers<br>
according to the invention, are also intended and are within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0078] In a preferred aspect of the invention, the compound that is capable of<br>
polymer coupling is a biologically active compound that is suitable for<br>
medicinal or diagnostic use in the treatment of animals, e.g., mammals,<br>
including humans, for conditions for which such treatment is desired. The<br><br>
foregoing list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting for the compounds<br>
that can be modified. Those of ordinary skill will realize that other such<br>
compounds can be similarly modified without undue experimentation. It is to<br>
be understood that those biologically active materials not specifically<br>
mentioned but having one or more available nucleophilic groups such as<br>
amino groups or thiols that are accessible for coupling with one or more<br>
polymers according to the invention are also intended and are within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0079] It is noted that bioactive components suitable for incorporation into the<br>
conjugates of the invention may be substances or compounds that are not<br>
active by themselves, while in the conjugate or immediately after hydrolytic<br>
release fi:om the conjugate, but that can become active after undergoing a<br>
further chemical processing or reaction. For example, an anticancer drug that<br>
is delivered to the bloodstream in the form of a conjugate of the present<br>
invention may remain inactive until entering a cancer or tumor cell,<br>
whereupon it is activated by a chemical process that occurs within the cancer<br>
or tumor cell, e.g., by an enzymatic reaction unique to or especially effective<br>
in that cell.<br>
[0080] Other compounds suitable for use as the bioactive compounds in the<br>
conjugates and compositions of the invention include hydroxyl-containing<br>
compounds, such as camptothecin and related inhibitors of topoisomerase I.<br>
Camptothecin is a water-insoluble cytotoxic alkaloid produced by<br>
Camptotheca accuminata trees, indigenous to China, and by Nothapodytes<br>
foetida trees, indigenous to India. Camptothecin and related compounds and<br>
analogs are also known to be potential anticancer or antitumor agents and have<br>
been shown to exhibit these activities in vitro and in vivo (see, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,943,579. 5,004,758 and Re 32,518, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference). Such compounds and derivatives thereof<br>
can be made using known synthetic techniques without undue<br>
experimentation. Preferred camptothecin derivatives for use herein include<br>
those that include a 20-OH or another hydroxyl group that is capable of<br>
reacting directly with activated forms of the polymers such as the<br>
monofunctionally activated PEGs of this invention.<br><br>
[0081] Additional hydroxyl-containing moieties suitable for use as bioactive<br>
components in the present conjugates include taxanes and paclitaxel<br>
derivatives. For purposes of the present invention, the term "taxane" includes<br>
all compounds within the taxane family of terpenes. Thus, Taxol (paclitaxel),<br>
3'-substituted t-butoxycarbonyl-amine derivatives, (taxoteres) and the like, as<br>
well as other analogs that are readily synthesized using standard organic<br>
techniques or are available from commercial sources such as Sigma (St. Louis,<br>
MO), are within the scope of the present invention. These compounds and<br>
their derivatives have been found to be effective anti-cancer agents.<br>
Numerous studies indicate that the agents have activity against a variety of<br>
malignancies and other cancers.<br>
[0082] As the ordinarily skilled artisan will appreciate, any bioactive<br>
component known and readily available in the art is suitable for conjugation<br>
with monofunctional polymers having reduced antigenicity, substantially<br>
reduced antigenicity or undetectable antigenicity, according to the present<br>
invention. In accordance with certain aspects of the invention, these initial<br>
bioactive components are used to produce conjugates in which one or more<br>
PAGs or PAOs are covalently linked to the bioactive molecule. Sites on the<br>
initial bioactive component molecules to which polymers may be attached<br>
advantageously include lysine residues found on peptide molecules, which<br>
residues each have two amino groups. One of these amino groups (the alpha<br>
amino group) participates in peptide bond formation (except when the lysine is<br>
the amino-terminal residue of the protein), leaving the other amino group (the<br>
epsilon amino group) available for polymer coupling. Other sites on protein<br>
or peptide molecules to which polymers advantageously may be attached<br>
include, among others, the alpha amino group at the amino-terminal residue of<br>
the polypeptide; the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues on the protein or<br>
peptide (Braxton, S.M., U.S. Patent No. 5,766,897), to which polymers<br>
activated with vinyl sulfone, maleimide, iodoacetamide, bromoacetamide or<br>
orthopyridyl disulfide, among other thiol-reactive groups that are known in the<br>
art, can be coupled; the guanido groups of arginine residues on the protein or<br>
peptide (Sano, A., et al, U.S. Patent No. 5,093,531), to which polymers<br>
activated with phenylglyoxal can be coupled; the alpha carboxyl group of the<br>
C-terminal residue, the beta carboxyl groups of aspartate residues on the<br><br>
protein or peptide and the gamma carboxyl groups of the glutamate residues<br>
on the protein or peptide (Sakane, T., et al. (1997) Pharm Res 14: 1085-1091),<br>
to which amino or hydrazide derivatives of the polymer can be coupled. Of<br>
course, other suitable sites on the protein or peptide molecule to which one or<br>
more polyalkylene oxides may be attached advantageously will be readily<br>
apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, particularly upon consideration of<br>
the primary and tertiary structures of the peptide and the disclosures herein.<br>
[0083] Before coupling a polymer to a target bioactive component (e.g., a<br>
protein), it can be advantageous to purify the component to remove<br>
contaminants; otherwise, the analysis of the extent of modification of the<br>
intact component can be complicated by the formation of polymer conjugates<br>
of the fragments of the component and other contaminants. Purification of the<br>
bioactive component may be advantageous regardless of whether the protein<br>
to be conjugated has been obtained from natural sources or produced by<br>
recombinant methods, since contaminants in the preparations can be expected<br>
from either source. Purification of a given bioactive component can be<br>
accomplished by any art-known method that will be familiar to the ordinarily<br>
skilled artisan, including but not limited to electrophoresis, dialysis, salt<br>
extraction (such as ammonium sulfate precipitation), chromatography (such as<br>
affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, size-exclusion<br>
chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC"), fast<br>
protein liquid chromatography ("FPLC") and the like) or a combination<br>
thereof It is to be understood, however, that purification of a given bioactive<br>
component is not essential for preparation of the polymer-bioactive<br>
component conjugates of the present invention, since bioactive components<br>
(especially proteins) in crude preparations can also be advantageously<br>
conjugated with polymers according to the methods of the present invention.<br>
Coupling of Polymers to Bioactive Components<br>
[0084] The P AGs employed in the practice of the present invention, which, as<br>
indicated above, are preferably activated by reaction with a coupling group,<br>
can be attached to any of several groups that may be present on the bioactive<br>
component molecule, e.g., carboxyl groups or amino groups that are not<br>
involved in peptide bonds, thiol groups and phenolic hydroxyl groups. For<br><br>
certain peptides or proteins, it is preferred that the activated PAGs be coupled<br>
to the N-terrainal alpha amino group and/or to the amino groups of lysine<br>
residues and/or to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues.<br>
[0085] The crude or purified bioactive component (e.g., protein) can be<br>
incubated with activated polymer in a buffer having a pH in the range of about<br>
11 or the highest pH at which any inactivation of the protein caused by<br>
alkalinity can be reversed, down to about pH 5 or the lowest pH at which any<br>
inactivation of the protein caused by acidity can be reversed (see Arakawa, T.,<br>
et al. (1990) Biopolymers 29:1065-1068). As is known in the art, and as one<br>
of ordinary skill will readily recognize, the use of a low pH for polymer<br>
coupling to proteins can be desirable for certain proteins or linkage<br>
chemistries. However, the use of a higher pH can be advantageous for certain<br>
other proteins and certain coupling chemistries, depending on the effects of pH<br>
on the solubility and stability of the protein and on the rate of inactivation of<br>
the activated polymer (whether spontaneous or catalyzed by the protein itself)<br>
relative to the rate of attachment of the polymer to the target protein according<br>
to methods that are known in the art.<br>
[0086] The reaction between the PAG and the bioactive component is<br>
normally carried out in solution, preferably an aqueous buffer solution<br>
providing a pH in the range of from about 5 to about 11. Particularly preferred<br>
for coupling a PAG to a proteinaceous bioactive component (e.g., a<br>
polypeptide, peptide, protein, or fragments thereof) are pH values of from<br>
about 7 to about 9, most preferably from about 7 to about 8. In other<br>
embodiments, pH values of about 4.5 to about 6.5 are preferred. Examples of<br>
buffer solutions that will provide pH values in these ranges at 25°C include,<br>
but are not limited to:<br>
50 mL of 0.1 molar potassium dihydrogen phosphate + 5.6 to<br>
46.1 mL 0.1 molar NaOH, diluted to 100 mL<br>
50 mL of 0.025 molar borate + 2.0 to 20.5 mL 0.1 molar HCl,<br>
diluted to 100 mL<br>
50 mL of 0.025 molar borate + 0.9 to 18.3 mL 0.1 molar<br>
NaOH, diluted to 100 mL<br><br>
50 mL of 0.05 molar sodium bicarbonate + 5.0 to 10.7 mL<br>
0.1 molar NaOH, diluted to 100 mL<br>
50 mL of 0.05 molar acetic acid + 5.0 to 30 mL 0.1 molar<br>
NaOH, diluted to 100 mL<br>
50 mL of 0.05 molar Tris HCl + 10 to 50 mL 0.1 molar Tris<br>
base, diluted to 100 mL<br>
The precise adjustment of the quantity of acid or base to be used to provide a<br>
particular desired pH will be readily determinable by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0087] If, in a given instance, the use of a biological buffer should be required,<br>
one of the following may be employed:<br>
Hydroxyethylpiperizine-ethane sulfonic acid ("HEPES")<br>
3-(N-Moipholino)propane sulfonic acid ("MOPS")<br>
3-(N-Morpholino)-2-hydroxypropane sulfonic acid<br>
("MOPSO")<br>
Piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-hydroxypropane sulfonic acid)<br>
("POPSO")<br>
[0088] The reaction between the PAG and the bioactive component will<br>
normally be performed under conditions that will not give rise to inactivation<br>
or denaturation, e.g., at temperatures at which the bioactive component retains<br>
substantial bioactivity and subject to no more agitation than necessary to<br>
assure adequate mixing of the reactants. The reaction between the PAG and<br>
bioactive proteins will preferably be conducted at a temperature in the range of<br>
from about 4°C to about 40°C. More preferably, the reaction will be<br>
conducted at between about 4°C and 8°C or at room temperature, i.e. from<br>
about 20°C to about 25°C. The reactions between the PAG and non-protein<br>
bioactive agents, e.g., peptides and bioactive organic chemicals, may be<br>
carried out at higher or lower temperatures that are compatible with the<br>
stability of the particular bioactive organic chemical that is being coupled to<br>
the PAG.<br>
[0089] It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the amount<br>
of PAG employed relative to the amount of bioactive component will be<br>
dependent upon the desired extent of polymer coupling to the bioactive<br>
component. For example, when it is desired to react a PAG with a particular<br>
fraction of the solvent-accessible lysine residues (in cases where the bioactive<br><br>
component is a polypeptide), a molar concentration of PAG at least equal to<br>
that of the lysines to be coupled will be required. Clearly, if fewer than all of<br>
the solvent-accessible reaction sites on the bioactive component molecule are<br>
to be derivatized, correspondingly less PAG will be required. In general,<br>
however, where molar excesses of PAGs are used, the present inventors have<br>
detennined that molar excesses on the order of 2 to 10 can be preferred.<br>
[00901 The time required for the reaction will depend upon a number of<br>
factors, such as reaction temperature, the concentrations of reactants, and the<br>
extent of derivatization desired. The course of the reaction can be monitored<br>
by conventional means, such as the periodic analysis of samples by size-<br>
exclusion chromatography or gel electrophoresis. The reaction can be<br>
terminated conveniently when desired by the addition of a low molecular<br>
weight compound having a reactive group, e.g., glycine, to scavenge excess<br>
amine-reactive PAG or by chromatographic fractionation. At room<br>
temperature, reaction time of about 15 minutes to about 24 hours will typically<br>
be required to react the PAG with the binding groups of most bioactive<br>
components (e.g., the lysine groups of polypeptide chains). Longer reaction<br>
times may be required at lower temperatures. The skilled practitioner will<br>
understand that the time for conjugation, as well as the amount and type of<br>
PAG, must not be such as to inactivate the bioactive component being<br>
employed, i.e., must not result in substantial loss of the biological activity of<br>
the bioactive component. By "not resulting in substantial loss of biological<br>
activity of the bioactive component" it is meant that the PAG-conjugated<br>
bioactive component demonstrates at least about 10%, preferably at least<br>
about 20%, 35%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 92%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or<br>
more of the level of bioactivity (e.g., enzymatic activity; receptor binding<br>
ability, anti-neoplastic activity; etc.) that is demonstrated in vitro or in vivo by<br>
the same bioactive component that has not been conjugated with a PAG.<br>
[0091] Purification of the polymer-coupled bioactive component can be<br>
effected by means commonly employed by those skilled in the art, such as, for<br>
example, size-exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography,<br>
ultrafiltration, dialysis, and the like. Solutions of the reaction product can, if<br>
desired, be concentrated with a rotary evaporator and the product can be<br>
obtained in the dry state by lyophilization.<br><br>
[0092] Depending upon the particular bioactive component used and the<br>
extent to which it is reacted with the PAG, the resulting adduct is expected to<br>
be useful diagnostically or therapeutically, exhibiting, as compared to the<br>
unreacted bioactive component, decreased antigenicity and immunogenicity,<br>
increased circulating life, and increased stability, while maintaining a useful<br>
level of biological activity.<br>
[0093J The bioactive component can be reacted with the monofunctionally<br>
activated branched poly(ethylene glycol) polymers discussed above<br>
(particularly one or more monofunctionally activated, branched<br>
dihydroxyPEGs, e.g., dihydroxyPEG-lysine) in an aqueous reaction medium<br>
that can be buffered, depending on the pH requirements of the nucleophile and<br>
the activated polymer. The optimal pH for the reaction is generally between<br>
about 6.5 and about 8.5 and preferably about 7.4 for maintaining the solubility<br>
and stability of most polypeptides. The optimal pH for coupling an activated<br>
PAG, e.g., NPC-PEG, to a mammalian uricase is approximately pH 10, while<br>
the optimal pH for selectively coupling certain activated PAGs to the<br>
N-terminal alpha amino group of a protein or peptide is in the range of about 4<br>
to about 7. The optimal reaction conditions necessary to maintain the stability<br>
of the bioactive component, the reaction efficiency, etc., axe within the level of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. The preferred temperature range is between about 4°C<br>
and about 40°C, The reaction temperature must not exceed the temperature at<br>
which the nucleophile may denature or decompose. It is preferred that the<br>
nucleophile be reacted with an excess of the activated branched polymer.<br>
Following the reaction, the conjugate is recovered and purified, for example,<br>
by diafiltration, column chromatography, combinations thereof, or the like.<br>
[0094] The use of molecular modeling can facilitate a strategy for the<br>
optimization of polymer coupling to a protein. For example, X-ray crystallo-<br>
graphic data can be used to generate computerized images of the solvent-<br>
accessible surfaces of proteins (Sayle, R.A., et al. (1995) Trends Biochem Sci<br>
20:374-376). Structural analyses that are based on nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance measurements can also be useful in this regard. The fraction of the<br>
accessible sites on the surface with which a particular activated polymer can<br>
react, and the distribution of polymer strands among the various sites, can be<br>
modulated by selecting the appropriate activating group, the molar ratio of the<br><br>
polymer to the protein and the appropriate conditions of the coupling reaction<br>
(e.g., pH, temperature, concentrations of reactants, duration of incubation). In<br>
certain circumstances, it can be advantageous to attach the polymer to residues<br>
that are sufficiently far from the active site of an enzyme to minimize any<br>
adverse effects on bioactivity. For example, the surface of Proteinase K<br>
contains many potential sites for the attachment of polymers that are activated<br>
with various chemistries. However, the previous discovery by some of the<br>
present inventors that the most solvent-accessible lysine residues of<br>
Proteinase K are located exclusively in a region of the enzyme that is<br>
relatively far from the catalytic site makes the use of amine-reactive polymers<br>
especially desirable for this particular enzyme (see commonly owned, co-<br>
pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/183,607, filed June 28, 2002, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[0095] In certain embodiments (e.g., in the case of enzymes in which the<br>
catalytic domain contains amino groups (such as those described above) with<br>
which the activated polymer can react), it may be desirable to shield the active<br>
site from contact with the activated polymer. In such cases, the enzyme can be<br>
bound tightly, but reversibly, to a substrate analog or competitive inhibitor that<br>
is sufficiently large to sterically hinder the access of the activated polymer to<br>
reactive residues within or near the active site (see, e.g., Nahri, L.O., et al.<br>
(1991) J Protein Chem 10:385-389). Alternatively, such analogs or inhibitors<br>
can be bound to a solid matrix to which the protein can be subsequently<br>
adsorbed. While bound to the resultant "affinity matrix," the protein can be<br>
reacted with the activated polymer. This strategy can minimize the coupling<br>
of the reactive polymer to sites where such coupling might inhibit catalysis.<br>
The selectively modified protein can be released from the affinity matrix<br>
subsequently, by methods that are known to those skilled in the art (see<br>
Wilchek, M., et al. (1984) Methods Enzymol 104:3-55). The resultant<br>
conjugates can include protein molecules to which the polymer is<br>
preferentially attached at sites where it does not interfere with the bioactivity<br>
of the protein.<br>
[0096] Following the coupling reaction, conjugates that are derivatized to<br>
various extents can be separated from each other using size-exclusion and/or<br><br>
ion-exchange chromatography, as described by Sherman, M.R., et al. (1997)<br>
supra. For example, chromatography on a Superdex®75 brand HR 10/30<br>
column or a Superdex® 200 brand HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia<br>
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) permits the separation of protein molecules that are<br>
PEGylated to different extents, as well as their separation from residual free<br>
PEG and from most byproducts of the coupling reaction (see commonly<br>
owned, co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 10/183,607, supra).<br>
Compositions<br>
[0097] The invention provides stabilized conjugates of PEGylated bioactive<br>
components of decreased antigenicity produced by the methods of this<br>
invention. In related aspects, the invention also provides compositions<br>
comprising one or more such conjugates. Compositions according to this<br>
aspect of the invention will comprise one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four,<br>
five, ten, etc.) of the above-described conjugates of the invention. In certain<br>
such aspects, the compositions may comprise one or more additional<br>
components, such as one or more buffer salts, one or more chaotropic agents,<br>
one or more detergents, one or more proteins (e.g., one or more enzymes), one<br>
or more polymers and the like. The compositions of this aspect of the<br>
invention may be in any form, including solid (e.g., dry powder) or solution<br>
(particularly in the form of a physiologically compatible buffered salt solution<br>
comprising one or more of the conjugates of the invention).<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0098] Certain compositions of the invention are particularly formulated for<br>
use as pharmaceutical compositions for use in prophylactic, diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic applications. Such compositions will typically comprise one or<br>
more of the conjugates of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers or excipients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier or excipient," as used herein, refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or<br>
liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any<br>
type that is capable of being tolerated by a recipient animal, including a human<br><br>
or other mammal, into which the pharmaceutical composition is introduced,<br>
without adverse effects resulting from its addition.<br>
[0099] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be<br>
administered to a recipient via any suitable mode of administration, such as<br>
orally, rectally, parenterally, intrasystemically, vaginally, intraperitoneally,<br>
topically (as by powders, ointments, drops or transdermal patch), buccally, as<br>
an oral or nasal spray or by inhalation. The term "parenteral" as used herein<br>
refers to modes of administration that include intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intraperitoneal, intracistemal, subcutaneous and intra-articular injection and<br>
infusion.<br>
[0100] Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention for<br>
parenteral injection can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous<br>
or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as<br>
sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions<br>
just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers,<br>
diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol,<br>
propylene glycol, poly(ethylene glycol), and the like), carboxymethylcellulose<br>
and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable<br>
organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for<br>
example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance<br>
of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of<br>
surfactants.<br>
[0101] Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also<br>
contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents<br>
and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be<br>
ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for<br>
example, paraben, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the<br>
like. It may also be desirable to include osmotic agents such as sugars, sodium<br>
chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical<br>
form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents that delay absorption,<br>
such as aluminum monostearate, hydrogels and gelatin.<br>
[0102] In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drugs, it is desirable<br>
to slow the absorption from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This<br><br>
may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous material with poor solubility in aqueous body fluids. The rate of<br>
absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn,<br>
may depend upon its physical form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a<br>
parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or<br>
suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
[0103] Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated<br>
matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-<br>
polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to carrier polymer and the<br>
nature of the particular carrier polymer employed, the rate of drug release can<br>
be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include<br>
biocompatible poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable<br>
formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or<br>
microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0104] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the<br>
form of sterile solid compositions that can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile<br>
water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0105] Sohd dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active<br>
compounds are mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient<br>
or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or<br>
extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid,<br>
b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and gum acacia, c)humectants such as<br>
glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato<br>
or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,<br>
e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) accelerators of absorption, such<br>
as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) adsorbents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium<br>
stearate, solid poly(ethylene glycols), sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures<br>
thereof In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also<br>
comprise buffering agents.<br><br>
[0106] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft- and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose (milk<br>
sugar) as well as high molecular weight PEGs and the like.<br>
[01071 The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules<br>
can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric or chronomodulating<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.<br>
They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of such a<br>
composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in<br>
a certain part of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed maimer.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in<br>
microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-<br>
mentioned excipients.<br>
[0108] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to<br>
the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents<br>
conunonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents,<br>
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene<br>
glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular,<br>
cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, PEGs and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and<br>
mixtures thereof<br>
[0109] In addition to inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include<br>
adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents,<br>
sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.<br>
[0110] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain<br>
suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols,<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, and mixtures<br>
thereof<br>
[0111] Topical administration includes administration to the skin or mucosa,<br>
including surfaces of the lung and eye. Compositions for topical<br>
administration, including those for inhalation, may be prepared as a dry<br><br>
powder which may be pressurized or non-pressurized. In non-pressurized<br>
powder compositions, the active ingredients in finely divided form may be<br>
used in admixture with a larger-sized pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier<br>
comprising particles having a size, for example, of up to 100 micrometers in<br>
diameter. Suitable inert carriers include sugars such as lactose and sucrose.<br>
Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have<br>
an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers.<br>
[0112] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition may be pressurized and<br>
contain a compressed gas, such as nitrogen or a liquefied gas propellant. The<br>
liquefied propellant medium and indeed the total composition may be<br>
preferably such that the active ingredients do not dissolve therein to any<br>
substantial extent. The pressurized composition may also contain a surface-<br>
active agent. The surface-active agent may be a liquid or solid non-ionic<br>
surface-active agent or may be a solid anionic surface-active agent. It is<br>
preferable to use the solid anionic surface-active agent in the form of a sodium<br>
salt.<br>
[0113] A further form of topical administration is to the eye. In this mode of<br>
administration, the conjugates or compositions of the invention are delivered<br>
in a pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle, such that the active<br>
compounds are maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient<br>
time period to allow the compounds to penetrate the conjunctiva or the corneal<br>
and internal regions of the eye, as for example the anterior chamber, posterior<br>
chamber, vitreous body, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris/ciliary,<br>
lens, choroid/retina and sclera. The pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic<br>
vehicle may, for example, be an ointment, vegetable oil or an encapsulating<br>
material.<br>
[0114] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories that can be prepared by mixing the conjugates or compositions<br>
of the invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as<br>
cocoa butter, PEG or a suppository wax, which are solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal<br>
cavity and release the drugs.<br>
[0115] The pharmaceutical compositions used in the present therapeutic<br>
methods may also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in<br><br>
the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid<br>
substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic,<br>
physiologically acceptable and metabolizable Upid capable of forming<br>
liposomes can be used. In addition to one or more of the conjugates or<br>
compositions of the invention, the present pharmaceutical compositions in<br>
liposomal form can also contain one or more stabilizers, preservatives,<br>
excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the<br>
phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form<br>
liposomes are known in the art {see, e.g., Zalipsky, S., et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,395,619). Liposomes that comprise phospholipids that are conjugated to<br>
PEG, most commonly phosphatidyl ethanolamine coupled to mPEG, have<br>
advantageous properties, including prolonged lifetimes in the blood circulation<br>
of mammals (Fisher, D., U.S. Patent No. 6,132,763). More advantageously,<br>
the hydroxyPEGs of the present invention may be substituted for mPEG in<br>
forming such PEG-liposomes. Most advantageously, the monofunctionally<br>
activated hydroxyPEGs of the present invention may be substituted for<br>
activated mPEGs in the synthesis of PEG-diacylglycerol that is to be<br>
incorporated into PEG-liposomes.<br>
Dose regimens<br>
[01161 The conjugates or compositions of the invention can be administered<br>
in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo to cells to enhance the cellular response to the active<br>
compound(s). One of ordinary skill will appreciate that effective amounts of a<br>
given active compound, conjugate or composition can be determined<br>
empirically and may be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable formulation or prodrug form. The compounds,<br>
conjugates or compositions of the invention may be administered to an animal<br>
or human patient in need thereof as veterinary or pharmaceutical compositions<br>
in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. It<br>
will be understood that, when administered to a human patient, the total daily,<br>
weekly or monthly usage of the compounds and compositions of the present<br>
invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment. The therapeutically effective dose level for any particular<br><br>
patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the type and degree of<br>
the cellular response to be achieved; the identity and/or activity of the specific<br>
compound{s), conjugate(s) or composition(s) employed; the age, body weight<br>
or surface area, general health, gender, diet and activity level of the patient;<br>
the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the<br>
active compound(s); the duration of the treatment; other drugs used in<br>
combination or coincidental with the specific compound(s), conjugate(s) or<br>
composition(s); and like factors that are well known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the pharmaceutical and medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill<br>
of the art to start doses of a given compound, conjugate or composition of the<br>
invention at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic<br>
effect and to gradually increase the dosages until the desired effect is<br>
achieved.<br>
[0117] Dose regimens may also be arranged in a patient-specific manner to<br>
provide a predetermined concentration of a given active compound in the<br>
blood, as determined by techniques accepted and routine in the art, e.g., size-<br>
exclusion, ion-exchange or reversed-phase HPLC. Thus, patient dose<br>
regimens may be adjusted to achieve relatively constant blood levels, as<br>
measured by HPLC, according to methods that are routine and familiar to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the medical, pharmaceutical and/or pharmacological<br>
arts.<br>
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Uses<br>
[0118] A diagnostic use of a conjugate of the invention might be for locating<br>
an antigenic moiety, e.g., a cancer, within the body of an animal, especially a<br>
human, by administration of a polymer-conjugated antibody of the invention,<br>
in which the conjugate is labeled on either the protein or polymer component<br>
to enable detection, e.g., by optical, radiometric, fluorescent or resonant<br>
detection as discussed below.<br>
[0119] The PAG-bioactive compound conjugates (preferably administered as<br>
compositions comprising such conjugates) of the present invention are<br>
expected to have much longer circulating half lives and reduced antigenicity<br>
and immunogenicity in vivo. These properties alleviate or ameliorate the rapid<br>
clearance from the circulation that is observed when many therapeutic<br><br>
compounds (particularly bioactive compounds such as those that are used as<br>
components in the conjugates of the present invention) are introduced into an<br>
animal, especially a human or other mammal, for therapeutic purposes. Use of<br>
the conjugates and compositions of the invention also reduces or eliminates<br>
concerns about repeated administration of a particular bioactive compound or<br>
component, which may otherwise provoke an immune response in the patient.<br>
Immune responses of concern include those that neutralize the bioactivity<br>
and/or increase the rate of clearance of the bioactive compound from the<br>
circulation (thereby decreasing the effectiveness of the diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic procedure) and those that cause adverse effects on the patient.<br>
[0120] Hence, in another aspect of the invention, the conjugates and<br>
compositions of the invention may be used in diagnostic or therapeutic<br>
methods, for example in diagnosing, treating or preventing a variety of<br>
physical disorders in an animal, particularly a mammal such as a human,<br>
predisposed to or suffering from such a disorder. In such approaches, the goal<br>
of the therapy is to delay or prevent the development of the disorder, and/or to<br>
cure or induce a remission of the disorder, and/or to decrease or minimize the<br>
side effects of other therapeutic regimens. Hence, the PAG-bioactive<br>
component conjugates and compositions of the present invention may be used<br>
for protection, suppression or treatment of physical disorders, such as<br>
infections or diseases. The term "protection" from a physical disorder, as used<br>
herein, encompasses "prevention," "suppression" and "treatment."<br>
"Prevention" involves the administration of a conjugate or composition of the<br>
invention prior to the mduction of the disease or physical disorder, while<br>
"suppression" involves the administration of the conjugate or composition<br>
prior to the clinical appearance of the disease; hence, "prevention" and<br>
"suppression" of a physical disorder typically are undertaken in an animal that<br>
is predisposed to or susceptible to the disorder, but that is not yet suffering<br>
therefrom. "Treatment" of a physical disorder, however, involves<br>
administration of the therapeutic conjugate or composition after the<br>
appearance of the disease. It will be understood that in human and veterinary<br>
medicine, it is not always possible to distinguish between "preventing" and<br>
"suppressing" a physical disorder. In many cases, the ultimate inductive event<br>
or events may be unknown or latent, and neither the patient nor the physician<br><br>
may be aware of the inductive event until well after its occurrence. Therefore,<br>
it is common to use the term "prophylaxis," as distinct from "treatment," to<br>
encompass both "preventing" and "suppressing" as defined herein. The term<br>
"protection," used in accordance with the methods of the present invention,<br>
therefore is meant to include "prophylaxis."<br>
[0121] Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise one or<br>
more steps that allow the clinician to achieve the above-described therapeutic<br>
goals. One such method of the invention may comprise, for example:<br>
(a)	identifying an animal (preferably a mammal, such as a human)<br>
suffering from or predisposed to a physical disorder; and<br>
(b)	administering to the animal an effective amount of one or more of<br>
the compounds or compositions of the invention as described<br>
herein, particularly one or more PAG conjugates of a bioactive<br>
component (or one or more pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising such conjugates), such that the administration of the<br>
compounds or compositions prevents, delays or diagnoses the<br>
development of, or cures or induces remission of, the physical<br>
disorder in the animal.<br>
[0122] As used herein, an animal that is "predisposed to" a physical disorder<br>
is defined as an animal that does not exhibit a plurality of overt physical<br>
symptoms of the disorder but that is genetically, physiologically or otherwise<br>
at risk for developing the disorder. In the present methods, the identification<br>
of an animal (such as a mammal, including a human) that is predisposed to, at<br>
risk for, or suffering from a given physical disorder may be accomplished<br>
according to standard art-known methods that will be familiar to the ordinarily<br>
skilled clinician, including, for example, radiological assays, biochemical<br>
assays (e.g., assays of the relative levels of particular peptides, proteins,<br>
electrolytes, etc., in a sample obtained from an animal), surgical methods,<br>
genetic screening, family history, physical palpation, pathological or<br>
histological tests (e.g., microscopic evaluation of tissue or bodily fluid<br>
samples or smears, immunological assays, etc.), testing of bodily fluids (e.g.,<br>
blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, saliva, semen and the like),<br>
imaging, (e.g., radiologic, fluorescent, optical, resonant (e.g., using nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) or electron spin resonance (ESR)), etc. Once an<br><br>
animal has been identified by one or more such methods, the animal may be<br>
aggressively and/or proactively treated to prevent, suppress, delay or cure the<br>
physical disorder.<br>
[0123] Physical disorders that can be prevented, diagnosed or treated with the<br>
conjugates, compositions and methods of the present invention include any<br>
physical disorders for which the bioactive component of the conjugate may be<br>
used in the prevention, diagnosis or treatment. Such disorders include, but are<br>
not limited to, a variety of cancers (e.g., breast cancers, uterine cancers,<br>
ovarian cancers, prostate cancers, testicular cancers, leukemias, lymphomas,<br>
lung cancers, neurological cancers, skin cancers, head and neck cancers, bone<br>
cancers, colon and other gastrointestinal cancers, pancreatic cancers, bladder<br>
cancers, kidney cancers and other carcinomas, sarcomas, adenomas and<br>
myelomas); infectious diseases (e.g., bacterial diseases, fungal diseases, viral<br>
diseases (including hepatitis and HIV/AIDS), parasitic diseases, and the like);<br>
genetic disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular<br>
dystrophy, Gaucher's disease, Pompe's disease, severe combined<br>
immunodeficiency disorder and the like), anemia, neutropenia, hemophiha and<br>
other blood disorders; neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis and<br>
Alzheimer's disease); enzymatic disorders (e.g., gout, uremia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, and the like); disorders of uncertain etiology (e.g.,<br>
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and the like); and other disorders of<br>
medical importance that will be readily familiar to the ordinarily skilled<br>
artisan. The compositions and methods of the present invention may also be<br>
used in the prevention of disease progression, such as in chemoprevention of<br>
the progression of a premalignant lesion to a malignant lesion.<br>
[0124] The therapeutic methods of the invention thus use one or more<br>
conjugates of the invention, or one or more of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention that may be administered to an animal in need<br>
thereof by a variety of routes of administration, including orally, rectally,<br>
parenterally (including intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally,<br>
intracistemally, subcutaneously and intra-articular injection and by infusion),<br>
intrasystemically, vaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders,<br>
ointments, drops or transdermal patch), buccally, as an oral or nasal spray or<br>
by inhalation. By the invention, an effective amount of the conjugates or<br><br>
compositions can be administered in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo to cells or to<br>
animals suffering from or predisposed to a particular disorder, thereby<br>
preventing, delaying, diagnosing or treating the disorder in the animal. As<br>
used herein, "an effective amount of a conjugate (or composition)" refers to an<br>
amount such that the conjugate carries out the biological activity of the<br>
bioactive component of the conjugate, thereby preventing, delaying,<br>
diagnosing, treating or curing the physical disorder in the animal to which the<br>
conjugate of the invention has been administered. One of ordinary skill will<br>
appreciate that effective amounts of the conjugates or compositions of the<br>
invention can be determined empirically, according to standard methods well-<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical and medical arts; see,<br>

[0125] It will be imderstood that, when administered to a human patient, the<br>
total daily, weekly or monthly dosage of the conjugates and compositions of<br>
the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment. For example, satisfactory results are<br>
obtained by administration of certain of the conjugates or compositions of the<br>
invention at appropriate dosages depending on the specific bioactive<br>
compound used, which dosages will be readily familiar to the ordinarily<br>
skilled artisan or which may be readily determined empirically using only<br>
routine experimentation. According to this aspect of the invention, the<br>
conjugates or compositions can be administered once or, in divided doses, e.g.,<br>
twice per day or per week or per month. Appropriate dose regimens for<br>
various modes of administration (e.g., parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intra-ocular, intranasal, etc.) can also be readily determined empirically, using<br><br>
only routine experimentation, or will be readily apparent to the ordinarily<br>
skilled artisan, depending on the identity of the bioactive component.<br>
[0126] In additional applications, the conjugates and compositions of the<br>
invention may be used to specifically target a diagnostic or therapeutic agent<br>
to a cell, tissue, organ or organism that expresses a receptor for, binds,<br>
incorporates or otherwise can take up, the bioactive component of the<br>
conjugate. Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise,<br>
for example, contacting the cell, tissue, organ or organism with one or more<br>
conjugates of the invention, which conjugates additionally comprise one or<br>
more diagnostic or therapeutic agents (preferably covalently linked to the P AO<br>
or PEG component of the conjugate), such that the conjugate is taken up by<br>
the cell, tissue, organ or organism by any mechanism (e.g., by receptor-<br>
mediated endocytosis, pinocytosis, phagocytosis, diffusion, etc.), thereby<br>
delivering the diagnostic or therapeutic agent to the cell, tissue, organ or<br>
organism. The diagnostic or therapeutic agent used in accordance with this<br>
aspect of the invention may be, but is not limited to, at least one agent selected<br>
from a nucleic acid, an organic compound, a protein, an antibody, an enzyme,<br>
a glycoprotein, a lipoprotein, an element, a lipid, a saccharide, an isotope, a<br>
carbohydrate, an imaging agent, a detectable probe, or any combination<br>
thereof, which also may be detectably labeled as described herein. A<br>
therapeutic agent used in this aspect of the present invention may have a<br>
therapeutic effect on the target cell (or tissue, organ or organism), the effect<br>
being selected from, but not limited to, correcting a defective gene or protein,<br>
a drug action, a toxic effect, a growth-stimulating effect, a growth-inhibiting<br>
effect, a metabolic effect, a catabolic affect, an anabolic effect, an antiviral<br>
effect, an antifungal effect, an antibacterial effect, a hormonal effect, a<br>
neurohumoral effect, a cell differentiation stimulatory effect, a cell<br>
differentiation inhibitory effect, a neuromodulatory effect, an anti-neoplastic<br>
effect, an anti-tumor effect, an insulin stimulating or inhibiting effect, a bone<br>
marrow stimulating effect, a pluripotent stem cell stimulating effect, an<br>
immune system stimulating effect, and any other known therapeutic effect that<br>
may be provided by a therapeutic agent delivered to a cell (or tissue, organ or<br>
organism) via a delivery system according to this aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
[0127] Such additional therapeutic agents, which can further comprise a<br>
bioactive conjugate or composition of the present invention, may be selected<br>
from, but are not limited to, known and new compounds and compositions<br>
including antibiotics, steroids, cytotoxic agents, vasoactive drugs, antibodies<br>
and other therapeutic agents. Non-limiting exan^les of such agents include<br>
antibiotics and other drugs used in the treatment of bacterial shock, such as<br>
gentamycin, tobramycin, nafcillin, parenteral cephalosporins, etc.; adrenal<br>
corticosteroids and analogs thereof, such as dexamethasone, which mitigate<br>
the cellular injury caused by endotoxins; vasoactive drugs, such as an alpha<br>
adrenergic receptor blocking agent (e.g., phenoxybenzamine), a beta<br>
adrenergic receptor agonist (e.g., isoproterenol), and dopamine.<br>
[0128] The conjugates and compositions of the invention may also be used for<br>
the diagnosis of disease and to monitor therapeutic response. In certain such<br>
methods, the conjugates of the invention may comprise one or more detectable<br>
labels (such as those described elsewhere herein). In specific such methods,<br>
these detectably labeled conjugates of the invention may be used to detect<br>
cells, tissues, organs or organisms expressing receptors for, or otherwise<br>
taking up, the bioactive component of the conjugates. In one example of such<br>
a method, the cell, tissue, organ or organism is contacted with one or more of<br>
the detectably labeled conjugates of the invention under conditions that favor<br>
the uptake of the conjugate by the cell, tissue or organism (e.g., by binding of<br>
the conjugate to a cell-surface receptor or by pinocytosis or diffusion of the<br>
conjugate into the cell), and then detecting the conjugate boimd to or<br>
incorporated into the cell using detection means specific to the label used (e.g.,<br>
fluorescence detection for fluorescently labeled conjugates; magnetic<br>
resonance imaging for magnetically labeled conjugates; radioimaging for<br>
radiolabeled conjugates; etc?). Other uses of such detectably labeled<br>
conjugates may include, for example, imaging a cell, tissue, organ or<br>
organism, or the internal structure of an animal (including a human), by<br>
administering an effective amount of a labeled form of one or more of the<br>
conjugates of the invention and measuring detectable radiation associated with<br>
the cell, tissue, organ or organism (or animal). Methods of detecting various<br>
types of labels and their uses in diagnostic and therapeutic imaging are well<br>
known to the ordinarily skilled artisan, and are described elsewhere herein.<br><br>
[0129] In another aspect, the conjugates and compositions of the invention<br>
may be used in methods to modulate the concentration or activity of a specific<br>
receptor for the bioactive component of the conjugate on the surface of a cell<br>
that expresses such a receptor. By "modulating" the activity of a given<br>
receptor it is meant that the conjugate, upon binding to the receptor, either<br>
activates or inhibits the physiological activity (e.g., the intracellular signaling<br>
cascade) mediated through that receptor. While not intending to be bound by<br>
any particular mechanistic explanation for the regulatory activity of the<br>
conjugates of the present invention, such conjugates can antagonize the<br>
physiological activity of a cellular receptor by binding to the receptor via the<br>
bioactive component of the conjugate, thereby blocking the binding of the<br>
natural agonist (e.g., the unconjugated bioactive component) and preventing<br>
activation of the receptor by the natural agonist, while not inducing a<br>
substantial activation of the physiological activity of the receptor itself<br>
Methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
steps, for example contacting the cell (which may be done in viti-o or in vivo)<br>
with one or more of the conjugates of the invention, under conditions such that<br>
the conjugate {i.e., the bioactive component portion of the conjugate) binds to<br>
a receptor for the bioactive component on the cell surface but does not<br>
substantially activate the receptor. Such methods will be useful in a variety of<br>
diagnostic, and therapeutic applications, as the ordinarily skilled artisan will<br>
readily appreciate.<br>
Kits<br>
[0130] The invention also provides kits comprising the conjugates and/or<br>
compositions of the invention. Such kits typically comprise a carrier, such as<br>
a box, carton, tube or the like, having in close confinement therein one or<br>
more containers, such as vials, tubes, ampuls, bottles and the like, wherein a<br>
first container contains one or more of the conjugates and/or compositions of<br>
the present invention. The kits encompassed by this aspect of the present<br>
invention may fiirther comprise one or more additional components (e.g.,<br>
reagents and compounds) necessary for carrying out one or more particular<br>
applications of the conjugates and compositions of the present invention, such<br>
as one or more components usefiil for the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of<br><br>
a particular disease or physical disorder (e.g., one or more additional<br>
therapeutic compounds or compositions, one or more diagnostic reagents, one<br>
or more carriers or excipients, and the like), one or more additional conjugates<br>
or compositions of the invention, and the like.<br>
[0131] It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the relevant arts<br>
that other suitable modifications and adaptations to the methods and<br>
applications described herein may be made without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention or any embodiment thereof Having now described the<br>
present invention in detail, the same will be more clearly understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are included herewith for purposes<br>
of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation and Testing of Antibodies to<br>
MonomethoxyPEG<br>
[0132] It has been reported previously that rabbits can be immunized to<br>
various PEGs by immunizing the animals with conjugates in which PEG was<br>
coupled to an immunogenic carrier protein (Richter, A.W,, et al. (1983) Int<br>
Arch Allergy Appl Immunol 70:124-131), A monoclonal antibody that reacts<br>
with the polyether backbone of PEG has been developed by injecting mice<br>
with an mPEG conjugate of β-glucuronidase and selecting hybridoma clones<br>
that produce antibodies to PEG (Cheng, T-L., et al. (1999), supra.; Cheng, T<br>
L., et al. (2000) supra; Tsai, N.-M., et al. (2001), supra.; Roffler, S., et al.,<br>
pubhshed U.S. Patent Application No. 2001/0028881 Al and U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,596,849 and 6,617,118; the disclosures of all of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entireties). Another monoclonal antibody that<br>
reacts with the polyether backbone of PEG has been disclosed recently by<br>
Roberts, M.J., et al., in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/001704 Al.<br>
[0133] In order to develop sensitive methods for the detection of PEG in PEG-<br>
protein conjugates, polyclonal antibodies against PEG were prepared as<br>
described below. Since nearly all PEG conjugates of therapeutic proteins<br>
described in the art have been synthesized with mPEG, the present inventors<br>
investigated the role of the methoxyl group, in the immunoreactivity of<br><br>
conjugates containing mPEG. The p-nitrophenyl carbonate derivative of<br>
10-kDa mPEG was custom synthesized by Shearwater Corporation<br>
(Huntsville, AL), a subsidiary of Nektar Therapeutics (San Carlos, CA). A<br>
urethane-linked mPEG conjugate of a recombinant mammalian uricase was<br>
prepared that contained the minimum number of strands of this 10-kDa mPEG<br>
needed to solubilize the protein at physiological pH (approximately two<br>
strands of PEG or mPEG per 35-kDa uricase subunit). This amount of PEG<br>
was not sufficient to suppress the unusually high immunogenicity of uricase<br>
(see Sherman, M.R., et al, PCT publication WO 01/59078 A2, and Kelly, S J.,<br>
et al. (2001) supra, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entireties). This PEG-uricase preparation was injected<br>
repeatedly into three rabbits in Freund's adjuvant and the rabbits were bled for<br>
the preparation of antisera containing polyclonal antibodies against uricase,<br>
PEG-uricase conjugates and PEG.<br>
[0134] Each rabbit was injected with the PEG-uricase preparation once in<br>
complete Freund's adjuvant and five times, at intervals of one to four weeks,<br>
in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Blood was sampled approximately two<br>
weeks after each of the last three injections. Serum was prepared from each of<br>
the nine blood samples and small volumes of serum were tested for antibodies<br>
against PEG by an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay ("ELISA"), using<br>
96-well plates that were coated with mPEG conjugates of a protein that is<br>
structurally unrelated to uricase.<br>
[0135] Each test bleeding yielded antiserum that reacted with PEG in ELISA<br>
analyses. The three rabbits each responded to immunization with PEG with<br>
qualitatively similar kinetics and with similar specificity for the methoxyl end<br>
group of mPEG, as measured by competitive ELISA. Initially, a dot blot<br>
analysis was performed to determine the sensitivity of the anti-PEG antibodies<br>
in the rabbit sera. Solutions of PEGs of various sizes and structures and the<br>
PEG-uricase solution that was used to immunize the rabbits were spotted onto<br>
a polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA;<br>
catalog # LS2002). After blocking the membrane with a solution of 2% (w/v)<br>
non-fat dry milk powder, the membrane was incubated with a dilution of the<br>
rabbit antiserum to PEG-uricase that was prepared as described above. Then a<br>
dilution of anti-rabbit IgG antibodies produced in goats and coupled to<br><br>
alkaline phosphatase (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA; catalog # 401371) was<br>
applied as a secondary antibody. Alkaline phosphatase activity on the blot<br>
was detected using a combination of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate<br>
and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma, catalog # B-1911), as described previously<br>
(Blake, M.S., et al. (1984) Anal Biochem 755:175-190, the disclosures of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). With high<br>
sensitivity and specificity, the rabbit anti-PEG antibodies detected the PEG<br>
solutions and the mPEG-protein conjugate that were tested.<br>
Example 2: Demonstration of the Role of the Methoxyi Group in the<br>
Antigenicity of mPEG<br>
[0136] Unexpectedly, the present inventors have found that the anti-PEG<br>
antibodies prepared as described in Example 1 were directed predominantly<br>
against the methoxyi end group of the mPEG component of the antigen.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the results from a competitive ELISA assay in which 96-well<br>
plates were coated with an mPEG conjugate of a protein that is structtirally<br>
unrelated to uncase. After blocking the plate with 2% goat serum, solutions of<br>
increasing concentration of 4.8-kDa mPEG (Polymer Laboratories, catalog #<br>
6570-5010), 10-kDa mPEG (Union Carbide, catalog # MPEG-10,000) or<br>
10-kDa t-butoxyPEG (Polymer Laboratories, catalog # 29999997) were added<br>
and incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit antiserum formed against the<br>
mPEG-uricase conjugate. After removing the solution, the extent of anti-PEG<br>
antibody bound to the mPEG-protein conjugate on the plate was measured<br>
spectrophotometrically, using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody<br>
(goat anti-rabbit IgG, Calbiochem®, San Diego, CA; catalog # 401393)<br>
followed by the addition of the peroxidase substrate, o-phenylenediamine<br>
dihydrochloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO; catalog # P-9781). For each sample,<br>
the initial reaction rate (in milli-absorbance units per minute) observed in the<br>
absence of a competitor was designated as 100%. The overlapping curves of<br>
the two solutions of mPEG suggest that the length of the PEG backbone is not<br>
the predominant determinant of its antigenicity. The curve for /-butoxyPEG is<br>
shifted to the right by approximately 2 log units, indicating that t-butoxyPEG<br>
has about a 100-fold lower affinity than mPEG for antibodies generated<br><br>
against an mPEG-protein conjugate. In previous unpublished experiments by<br>
certain of the present inventors, however, it was found that t-butoxyPEG<br>
displays significant immunogenicity when conjugated to an immunogenic<br>
protein. Thus, while Figure I demonstrates very little cross-reactivity of<br>
t-butoxyPEG with antibodies raised against mPEG, the use of r-butoxyPEG<br>
instead of mPEG in the production of PEGylated therapeutic proteins would<br>
not solve the problem of the immunogenicity of the PEG component.<br>
[0137] The results depicted in Figure 1 suggest that the methoxyl group on<br>
mPEG is the predominant antigenic group on the polymer molecule. To<br>
confirm this inference, the antibodies generated as described in Example I<br>
were subjected to competitive ELISA analysis, performed as described for<br>
Figure 1, using PEGs of various sizes and structures containing one or two<br>
methoxyl groups. Figure 2a displays the results for antibody binding, graphed<br>
as a function of the molar concentration of methoxyl groups in each sample.<br>
The concentration of competitor resulting in 50% inhibition of the binding<br>
('TC50") was calculated using the equation for a 5-parameter sigmoid curve<br>
and the program SigmaPlot®, (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL).<br>
[0138] As shown in Figure 2a, the following PEGs were all similarly antigenic<br>
on a molar basis: linear PEGs with one methoxyl group ("10-kDa mPEG"),<br>
prepared by hydrolysis of mPEG-NPC (PEG-Shop) and "mono-20-kDa<br>
mPEG-lysine," synthesized by coupling lysine to 20-kDa NPC-PEG<br>
(Shearwater, catalog # M-NPC-20,000); a linear PEG with two methoxyl<br>
groups ("Bis-(2-kDa) mPEG" (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog # 81314)), and a large<br>
"branched" PEG containing two methoxyl groups ("Di-(20-kDa) mPEG-<br>
lysine" (Shearwater, catalog # PEG2-NHS-40K)). hi contrast, the curve for<br>
the smaller "branched" PEG witli two methoxyl groups ("Di-(5-kDa) mPEG-<br>
lysuie" (Shearwater, catalog # 2Z3X0L01)) was shifted to the left of the mean<br>
of the results for the other samples by 0.5 to 0.6 log units, indicating that this<br>
form of "branched" mPEG is three to four times as antigenic as the other<br>
samples tested in this experiment. Figure 2b displays the data from Figure 2a<br>
as a function of the weight concentration of mPEG (microgram/mL) instead<br>
of the molar concentration of methoxyl groups, supporting the conclusion that<br><br>
it is the methoxyl group that is critical for the interaction of mPEG with the<br>
anti-mPEG antibodies.<br>
[0139] Figures displays a subset of the data from Figures I, 2a and 2b in a<br>
format that demonstrates the direct dependence of the antigenicity on the<br>
number of methoxyl groups per molecule of PEG. These samples represent<br>
10-kDa PEGs with no methoxyl group ("10-kDa r-butoxyPEG"), with one<br>
methoxyl group ("10-kDa mPEG") or with two methoxyl groups ("Di-<br>
(5-kDa) mPEG-lysine"). The results indicate that the antigenicity of a given<br>
polymer, and thus of a conjugate of the invention produced with this polymer,<br>
is directly dependent upon the number of methoxyl groups contained on the<br>
PEG polymer molecule. The larger the number of methoxyl groups, the<br>
higher the affinity of the polymer for the antibodies raised against an mPEG-<br>
protein conjugate.<br>
[0140] Taken together, these results indicate that complete inhibition of the<br>
binding of the rabbit antibodies to an mPEG conjugate could be accomplished<br>
by competition with solutions of PEG, and especially of mPEG. Moreover,<br>
the ability of solutions of mPEGs to block the binding of the rabbit anti-PEG<br>
antibodies to mPEG conjugates of an unrelated protein is correlated with their<br>
content of methoxyl groups. On the basis of concentration by weight, mPEGs<br>
of lower molecular weight were more potent competitors than mPEGs of<br>
higher molecular weight, as shown in Figure 2b. This conclusion is consistent<br>
with the fact that the ratio of the mass of the methoxyl groups to the total mass<br>
of the polymer decreases as the molecular weight of the polymer increases.<br>
Among the PEGs that were tested, the most potent antigens (on a molar basis)<br>
were the "branched" PEGs containing two methoxyl groups, which are<br>
sometimes referred to as umbrella-like or "U-PEGs" (Martinez, A., et al, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,643,575) or as "Y-PEGs" (Greenwald, R.B., et al. published U.S.<br>
Patent Application No. 2002/ 0052443 Al).<br>
Examples: Testing of Anti-PEG Antibodies with PEGs Lacking<br>
Methyoxyl Groups<br>
[0141] The term "PharmaPEG" is used herein to refer to linear or branched<br>
PEGs lacking an antigenic group at the terminus or termini that is or are distal<br>
from the terminus that ie activated or can be activated. From the previous<br><br>
examples, it can be inferred that the antigenicity of a polymer, and therefore of<br>
a polymer conjugate of a bioactive agent, is a function of the content of<br>
methoxyl groups in the polymer. To further test this inference, competitive<br>
ELISA analyses were performed, as described for Figure 1, comparing the<br>
abilities of mPEG ("4.8-kDa mPEG") and 12-kDa, 20-kDa and 35-kDa<br>
PhannaPEGs, which have no methoxyl groups or other alkoxyl groups at the<br>
ends of the linear polymers, to be bound by anti-mPEG antibodies. Results<br>
are shown in Figure 4. The shift of the three PharmaPEG curves relative to<br>
the mPEG curve depicted in Figure 4 indicates that the antigenicity of<br>
PharmaPEG is approximately 100-fold lower than that of mPEG, when<br>
assayed with anti-mPEG antibodies. Hence, polymers lacking methoxyl<br>
groups ie.g., PharmaPEG) are reduced or substantially reduced in antigenicity<br>
when compared to the polymers that are traditionally used for bioconjugation<br>
of pharmaceuticals, e.g., mPEG.<br>
[0142] As noted above, on a weight basis, the competitive potencies of<br>
mPEGs are inversely proportional to their molecular weights. However, PEGs<br>
lacking methoxyl groups had only about 1% of the competitive potencies of<br>
mPEGs, independent of their molecular weights. These results support the<br>
conclusion that monofunctionally reactive polymers lacking methoxyl groups<br>
are particularly well suited for use in preparing polymer conjugates of<br>
bioactive agents that have reduced, substantially reduced, or no antigenicity<br>
compared to conjugates produced using mPEGs, especially "branched"<br>
mPEGs, such as di-mPEG-lysine.<br>
Example 4: Detection of PEGylated Protein Conjugates by Western<br>
Blots with Anti-mPEG Antibodies<br>
[01431 MonomethoxyPEG conjugates of carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1;<br>
"CA II") were used as models in testing the ability of the anti-mPEG<br>
antibodies to detect PEGylated protein conjugates following polyacrylamide<br>
gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate ("SDS-PAGE").<br>
Gels were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the<br>
blots were incubated with rabbit anti-mPEG antibodies (diluted 1:200),<br>
followed by incubation with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG)<br><br>
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and exposure to a substrate that fonns a<br>
colored precipitate. This method of immunologic detection of proteins or<br>
polymer-protein conjugates transferred from an electrophoretic gel to a<br>
membrane is commonly referred to as a "Western blot" (Tsang, V.C.W., et al,<br>
(1984) Anal Biochem 143.-304-307). The detection procedure and reagents<br>
were the same as those described for the dot blots in Bxample 1. The results<br>
are shown in Figure 5 a. Lanes 1 and 2 show a gel stained for protein using<br>
SYPRO® brand Ruby Stain (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, catalog #<br>
S-12000) and photographed with a Kodak digital camera, using an<br>
Orange/Red visible light filter (Molecular Probes, catalog # S-6655) in a dark<br>
hood with illumination at 302 nm. Lanes 3 and 4 show the results of a<br>
Western blot of the same samples. Anti-mPEG antibodies are seen in the<br>
positions of all of the PEGylated species (Lane 3) but not of the unmodified<br>
carbonic anhydrase (Lane 4).<br>
[0144] Figure 5b shows the quantitation of band intensities in the gel and<br>
Westem blot shown in Figure 5a, obtained with Kodak ID Imaging Analysis<br>
software (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The horizontal axis represents the<br>
migration distance relative to the dye front and the vertical axis represents the<br>
relative intensities of the protein stain or anti-mPEG stain. The bottom tracing<br>
shows bands of SeeBlue Plus2TM brand pre-stained standard proteins<br>
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA; catalog # LC5625), in which the peaks<br>
numbered 1 through 8 identify proteins with the following apparent molecular<br>
weights (in kDa): 204, 111, 68.8, 51.5, 40.2, 28.9, 20.7 and 14.9, respectively.<br>
The second tracing from the bottom is an anti-mPEG antibody stain of<br>
PEGylated carbonic anhydrase. The third tracing from the bottom represents<br>
the protein-stained band of carbonic anhydrase and the top tracing shows the<br>
protein-stained mPEG conjugates of carbonic anhydrase. The numbers above<br>
the peaks in Figure 5b indicate the numbers of mPEG strands coupled to<br>
carbonic anhydrase in the conjugate(s) in that peak. PEGo indicates the<br>
position of carbonic anhydrase to which no PEG is coupled.<br>
[0145] Together, these results indicate that anti-mPEG antibodies are able to<br>
form complexes readily with PEGylated proteins prepared with a reactive<br>
form of mPEG, and thereby allow their sensitive and selective detection.<br>
When such conjugates are introduced into an animal for diagnostic.<br><br>
Iprophylactic or therapeutic purposes, the induction of anti-mPEG antibodies<br>
would contribute to an accelerated rate of clearance of the agent from the<br>
bloodstream, thereby limiting the efficacy of those conjugates and potentially<br>
leading to adverse effects mediated by the formation of immune complexes.<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of PharmaPEG-Mononitrophenyl Carbonate<br>
[0146] A requirement for preparing monofimctionally activated PharmaPEG<br>
from PEG diol is that, at some step in the synthesis, one of the terminal groups<br>
of the PEG must have properties that allow the separation of PEGs containing<br>
different numbers of that terminal group. Such a group might be more<br>
hydrophobic than either PEG or activated PEG, allowing the separation by<br>
reversed-phase chromatography ("RP chromatography"). Alternatively, such<br>
a group might be charged, permitting separation by ion-exchange<br>
chromatography. Such a group might be part of a solid phase, allowing phase<br>
separation from liquids in which the unbound PEG is soluble. If the activating<br>
group can be used as the basis of the separation, as in the case of NPC-PEG<br>
described in this Example 5, then the attachment of the activating group is the<br>
only synthetic reaction needed. If a removable blocking group, e.g., a t-butyl<br>
or triphenylmethyl ("trityl") group, provides the basis of the separation, the<br>
blocking group can be added either before or after the attachment of the<br>
activated or activatable group, as described in Example 6. In theory, the<br>
purification step used to isolate PEG containing the desired number of<br>
blocking groups can be performed at any time after the blocking group is<br>
attached. In practice, the relative labilities of the bonds between the polymer<br>
backbone and the blocking group and between the polymer backbone and the<br>
activating (or activatable) group may dictate the optimal sequence of the steps.<br><br>
[0147] The synthesis of monofunctionally activated NPC-PEG from<br>
dihydroxyPEG is summarized in the following diagram, in which Ph denotes a<br>
phenyl group and n denotes the number of ethylene oxide units in the polymer,<br>
which is about 227 for 10-kDa PEG.<br><br>
PharmaPEG-Mononitrophenyl carbonate<br>
[0148] PEG diols from several suppliers, all of which were labeled as having<br>
molecular weights of 10 kDa, were tested for purity and homogeneity. None<br>
of them contained more than 90% of PEG with a molecular weight of about<br>
10 kDa. Therefore, 10-kDa PEG diol (Fluka Chemical Corp., Milwaukee, WI,<br>
catalog #81280) was fractionated from contaminants of lower molecular<br>
weight by reversed-phase chromatography on an Amberchrom MD-P CG-<br>
300SD column (7.5 mm x 15 cm, TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). PEG<br>
was loaded onto the colunm as a solution in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water and<br>
was eluted with a linear gradient of 5% to 35% acetonitrile in water. Fractions<br>
were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex® 200 brand<br>
HRlO/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) in 20 mM<br>
sodium acetate containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.6. Fractions from the<br>
Amberchrom column in which more than 98% of the refractive index ("RI")<br>
signal due to PEG was in the peak corresponding to about 10-kDa PEG were<br>
pooled and lyophilized.<br><br>
[0149) The purified, dried PEG diol (530 mg) was combined with 61.4 mg<br>
P-nitrophenyl chloroformate (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, catalog # 16,021-0)<br>
and dissolved in 4 mL acetonitrile in a screw-c^ped 13 x 100 mm glass tube,<br>
giving final concentrations of about 12.5 mM PEG diol and about 75 mM<br>
/7-nitrophenyl chloroformate. Pyridine (0.25 g) was added and the reaction<br>
mixture was incubated overnight at 36°C. The reaction was quenched by<br>
stirring the mixture into 33 mL of ice-cold 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. The<br>
solution was filtered to remove a slight precipitate of p-nitrophenol and was<br>
dialyzed for one day in the cold against four 1-L changes of water.<br>
Acetonitrile was added to the dialyzed solution to bring the concentration to<br>
5% (v/v). Half of the mixture produced in Step 1 (24 mL), which contained<br>
about 265 mg of the purified lO-kDa PEG diol, was loaded onto the<br>
Amberchrom column and the bound PEG species were eluted with a gradient<br>
of 5% to 65% acetonitrile in water. Fractions were analyzed by size-exclusion<br>
chromatography as before, monitoring both the refractive index and<br>
absorbance at 280 nm. DihydroxyPEG, which lacked absorbance at 280 nm,<br>
was eluted first, followed by PEG derivatized with a single P-nitrophenyl<br>
group ("mono-NPC PEG"), followed by di-NPC PEG, for which the ratio of<br>
absorbance at 280 nm to the refractive index was twice that of mono-NPC-<br>
PEG. Two fractions in the center of the mono-NPC PEG elution range were<br>
combined to give about 110 mg of mono-NPC PEG, corresponding to a yield<br>
of about 42%. The product of Step 2 could be dried for storage in a desiccator<br>
and/or a freezer or used directly for coupling to an amine-containing bioactive<br>
compound or to a linker containing two or more amino groups for the<br>
preparation of branched PEGs, e.g., diPEG-lysine, which contained no<br>
alkoxyl groups.<br>
Example 6: Synthesis of a PbarmaPEG-Monoaldehyde from PEG Diol<br>
[01501 The synthesis of the monopropionaldehyde derivative of PharmaPEG<br>
is summarized in the following diagram, in which KOtBu denotes potassium<br>
t-butoxide, and DEP denotes the 3,3-diethoxypropyl group.<br><br><br>
PharmaPE G-Monopropionaldehyde<br>
[0151] Preferably, the dihydroxyPEG that is used as starting material for<br>
Step 1 will have a molecular weight that is within 10% of its nominal<br>
molecular weight and will have a polydispersity of 
defined as the ratio of the weight-average molecular weight ("Mw") to the<br>
number-average molecular weight ("Mn")- Both of these parameters, Mw and<br>
Mn, can be measured by size-exclusion chromatography, using PEGs of<br>
accurately known molecular weights as standards and gel permeation<br>
chromatography software such as EZChrom Elite Client/Server Software,<br>
Version 2.8.3 (Scientific Software, Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Alternatively, the<br>
polydispersity of PEGs can be measured by matrix-assisted laser<br>
desorption/ioni2ation time-of-flight ("MALDI-TOF") mass spectroscopy<br>
(Marie, A., et al., (2000) Anal Chem 72:5106-5114), using software such as<br>
Voyager Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For the preparation<br><br>
of pharmaceutical products containing covalently linked PEG, the PEG<br>
starting material will preferably have a polydispersity of 
preferably 
starting material may be obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co., Fluka<br>
Chemicals (Buchs, Switzerland), Shearwater Corporation or from Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., among other suppliers that are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
If the starting material is not sufficiently homogeneous, it can be fractionated<br>
by an adaptation of the method described in Example 5.<br>
[0152] A mixture of monopropionaldehyde and dipropionaldehyde diethyl<br>
acetal derivatives of PEG diol can be synthesized using 3-chloro-<br>
propionaldehyde diethyl acetal (Aldrich catalog #C6,900-4), as described for<br>
acetaldehyde diethyl acetal by Harris, J.M,, et al., ((1984) JPolym Sci 22:341-<br>
352) (see Step 1). Similar methods were also described by Bentley, M.D,,<br>
et al., ((1998) J Pharm Sci 87:1446-1449) and were subsequently patented by<br>
Bentley, M.D., et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,990,237).<br>
[0153] A sufficient quantity of triphenyhnethyl chloride (chlorotriphenyl-<br>
methane or trityl chloride, Ph3CCl, e.g., Aldrich catalog #T8,380-1) dissolved<br>
in pyridine is added to the mixture produced in Step 1 so that, under the<br>
reaction conditions, the Ph3CCl will react with all of the hydroxyl groups of<br>
the PEG starting material that are not coupled to the propionaldehyde diethyl<br>
acetal (Kocienski, P.J., supra). To complete Step 2, the mixture is recovered<br>
after precipitation by the addition of a poor solvent for PEG (e.g., ether) or by<br>
evaporation of the solvent or by other methods that are known in the art.<br>
[0154] The mixture recovered from Step 2 is dissolved in water before or after<br>
the addition of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and the solution is loaded onto a reversed-<br>
phase column that is expected from principles known in the art to be capable<br>
of binding trityl derivatives of PEG. The column may contain alkyl or aryl<br>
derivatives of silica or a polymeric substrate, or it may be a styrene-based<br>
polymer (e.g., Amberchrom MD-P CG-300), as in Example 5. The PEG diol<br>
and trityl derivatives can be eluted in a reversed-phase mode with an<br>
increasing gradient of organic solvent, as in Examples, or in a sample<br>
displacement mode by continuing to load the column until at least a portion of<br><br>
the desired species has been eluted (Agner, E., et al., PCT publication<br>
WO 00/23798 Al) or in displacement mode (Cramer, S.M., U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,239,262), or in a combination of these modes. In general, the PEG<br>
derivative lacking any trityl group will elute first, the monotrityl derivative<br>
will elute second and the ditrityl PEG will elute third. An optimal yield of the<br>
desired product is obtained when the ratios of these three species are 1:2:1. To<br>
improve the yield and/or purity of the desired monotrityl PEG product, it may<br>
be desirable to subject a portion of the colunm effluent to recycling<br>
chromatography, as is well known in the chromatographic art. To complete<br>
Step 3, the portion of the eluate that contains at least a portion of the<br>
monotrityl derivative is separated, concentrated and dried by methods that are<br>
known in the art.<br>
[0155] Under mildly acidic conditions and at low temperature, the acetal can<br>
be converted to the aldehyde, while preserving most of the trityl linkage at the<br>
distal end of the PEG. In some applications of this example, it may be<br>
advantageous to react the monotrityl PEG monoaldehyde with a target moiety<br>
before removing the trityl group. Such embodiments are envisioned by and<br>
included in the present invention.<br>
Example 7: Demonstration of the Decreased Immunogenicity of<br>
Conjugates Prepared with HydroxyPEG Compared with<br>
MethoxyPEG<br>
[0156] Proceeding as described for immunization with mPEG conjugates of<br>
uricase, as in Example 1, groups of three rabbits were immunized with either<br>
mPEG conjugates or hydroxyPEG conjugates of the same preparation of<br>
porcine uricase, each containing an average of about two strands of 10-kDa<br>
PEG per uricase subunit. The average number of strands of polymer attached<br>
to each preparation of conjugates was confirmed by both size-exclusion HPLC<br>
analyses and by SDS-PAGE, in which the gels were stained both for protein,<br>
as in Example 4, and for PEG, using the method described in commonly<br>
owned co-pending U.S. Patent Application 10/183,607, filed June 28, 2002,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Each rabbit was<br>
injected with one of the PEG-uricase preparations once in complete Freund's<br><br>
adjuvant and five times, at intervals of one to four weeks, in incomplete<br>
Freund's adjuvant. Blood was drawn two weeks after the fourth and fifth<br>
injections in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and sera were prepared. When<br>
serial 4-fold dilutions of the sera from these rabbits were tested by ELISA<br>
analyses, as in Example 2, the concentration of anti-PEG antibodies that was<br>
induced by the conjugates prepared with hydroxyPEG was found to be less<br>
than 5% of that induced by the conjugates prepared with mPBG (see Figures<br>
6a and 6b). In contrast, the induction of anti-uricase antibodies by the<br>
conjugates prepared with the two types of PEG was similar in the two groups<br>
of rabbits. None of the preimmunization sera from these rabbits contained<br>
detectable anti-PEG antibodies.<br>
Discussion and Conclusions<br>
[01571 It has been reported in the art that PEG terminated in a methoxyl group<br>
(mPEG) and PEG terminated in a hydroxyl group (bis-hydroxyPEG or PEG<br>
diol) are equivalent for use in bioconjugation, or, more often, that mPEGs and<br>
other lower alkoxyl PEGs are superior to PEG diols. Moreover, bis-activated<br>
diols can act as cross-linking agents, which can be undesirable for producing<br>
soluble, long-acting bioconjugates of low immunogenicity and antigenicity.<br>
Surprisingly, the results of the present studies indicate that mPEGs are<br>
significantly antigenic, and that antibodies induced against the methoxyl group<br>
of mPEG bind to PEGylated protein conjugates prepared using mPEG.<br>
Hence, unexpectedly and contrary to previous reports, mPEG is not equivalent<br>
to hydroxyPEG and mPEG is not preferred for preparing polymer conjugates<br>
of bioactive components (such as proteins) that are intended to have increased<br>
bioavailability, stability in the blood circulation and minimal immunogenicity.<br>
[0158] Based on the present results, it is clear that the use of monofunctionally<br>
activated PEG that does not contain a methoxyl group or another alkoxyl<br>
group for the synthesis of protein conjugates results in conjugates with<br>
decreased immunoreactivity. The resultant conjugates have been<br>
demonstrated to have decreased antigenicity, i.e., decreased ability to interact<br>
with antibodies developed against mPEG conjugates of the same protein, and<br>
decreased immunogenicity, i.e., decreased ability to evoke an immune<br>
response against the PEG component. As a corollary, conjugates prepared<br><br>
with branched PEGs containing two or more methoxyl groups are expected to<br>
be more immunogenic than conjugates prepared from branched PEGs lacking<br>
alkoxyl groups.<br>
[0159] Finally, based on the present findings, the use of monofunctionally<br>
activated PEG that does not contain a methoxyl group or another alkoxyl<br>
group, rather than monofunctionally activated mPEG, for the synthesis of<br>
PEG-liposomes is expected to confer on the resulting PEG-liposomes a<br>
decreased immunoreactivity, including a decreased tendency to trigger the<br>
activation of complement in blood, and a decreased tendency to induce acute<br>
respiratory distress or anaphylactoid and pseudo-allergic reactions.<br>
