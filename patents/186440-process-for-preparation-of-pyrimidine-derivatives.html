BACKGROUND ART<br>
5,6-Dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylarrano)-4-(l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetra-hydroisoo.uinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine of the above formula (I) inhibits gastric acid secretion by means of a reversible proton-pump inhibiting effect and. therefore, can be used as an anti-ulcer agent. This compound was developed by the inventors of the present invention, who then applied for patents for the compound and/or its method of preparation in Korea and other countries (see International Publication No. WO 96/05177).<br>
According to the method disclosed in the above patent application, 5,G-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenyIajnino)-4-(l-methyl-1,2,3,4- tetrahydroisoq uinolin-2-yl)pyrimid.ine  is   prepared  according   to   the   following  reaction scheme A-<br>
Reaction scheme A<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Since the starting material of the above reaction scheme has two reactive sites (i.e., the two Cl atoms), the first reaction inevitably produces a side product, which reduces the yield of the desired compound.<br>
The present inventors have long labored to develop a novel method for preparing 5,6-dimethyl'2-(4-fIuorophenylainino)-4-(l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoUn-2-yl)pynmidine of formula (I) without producing side products. As a result, we have discovered that the desired compound of formula (I) can be efficiently prepared without side products by reacting the pyrimidine derivative represented by formula (11^ A) with l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline represented by formula (HI) and, thus, have completed the present invention.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparation of 5,6-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-1,2,3.4- tetrahydroiso-ciuinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine represented by formula (I) and its acid addition<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of 5,6-dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-1.2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)pyrimidlne represented by formula (I),<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and its acid addition salts wherein a pyrimidine derivative represented by the following formula (n-A),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in   which   Hal   represents   a  halogen,   is   reacted   with   l-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline represented by formula (III),<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In addition, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of the pyrimidine derivative of formula (II-A) and the compound of formula (HI).<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a novel intermediate compound represented by the following formula (II), which includes the pyrimidine derivative represented by formula (II-A),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in R represents hydroxy and a halogen.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is also disclosed a process for preparing 5,6-<br>
dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl-amJno)-4-(1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)<br>
pyrimidine represented by the following formula (I),<br><br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
and its acid addition salts, wherein a pyrimidine derivative represented by the following formula (II-A),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Hal representes a halogen, is reacted with 1 -methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline represented by the following formula (III), optionally in the presence of a solvent and optionally in the presence of the base as herein described.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Although the 4-halogeno-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-5,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine represented by formula (DhA) can be reacted according to the present invention with an equivalent amount of l-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydroisoquinoline represented by formula (III), it is preferable to conduct lhe reaction using an excess, rather than an equivalent amount, of the latter. Since the latter is a liquid under reaction conditions, the unreacted l-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline can be readily removed after the reaction has gone to completion.<br>
The reaction of the present invention is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Solvents which may be used for this purpose include N,N-dimethylformamide, n-butanol, n-pcntanol, n-hexanol, dimethylsulfoxide, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, and mixtures thereof. Of these propylene glycol and ethylene glycol are most preferred, since use of either of these minimizes both reaction time and production of side products.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the reaction scheme 1 is generally carried out in the presence of a base. Bases which can be used for this purpose include triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine and potassium acetate. The reaction temperature for die reaction between the compound of formula (II-A) and 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroJsoquinoline of formula (in) is preferably in the range from 110 C to 160"C and the reaction time is preferably in the range from 16 hours to 72 hours.<br>
5,6-Dimethyl-2-(4-fluorophenylanuno)-4-(l-methyl-l.,2,3,4-tetra-hydroisoquinolin-2-yl)pyrimidine of formula (I) as prepared according to die above method can be converted into its acid addition salt, preferably into the hydrochloride salt, by conventional medinds- The resulting product can be purified by conventional working-up procedures, such as recrystallization, chromatography, and the like.<br>
Since the compound of formula (I) prepared by the method of the present invention contains an asymmetric carbon atom (i.e., the carbon<br>
•iTonr denoted by in the formula immediately below), this compound be present in an (ll)-(-)-isomer, an (S)-(-)-isomer, or a racemate wherein the R and S isomers are mixed in the ratio of 1:1. . Unless indicated otherwise, the compound of formula (I) should be interpreted to include all of these isomers.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
The (R)-(+)- and (S)-{-)-isomers of the compound of formula (I) can be readily be prepared from the R and S isomers, respectively, of the compound of formula (III).<br>
The compound of formula (II-A), which is used as the starting material in the method of the present invention, is a novel compound which can be prepared according to the method depicted by the following reaction scheme 2:<br>
Reaction scheme<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In the reaction scheme 2, Hal represents a halogen.<br>
As depicted by the reaction scheme 2, reacting 4-fluorophenyl-guanidine carbonate of formula (IV) with ethyl 2-methylacetoacetate of formula (V) yields 4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenylarnino)-5,6-dimethyl-pyrimidine of formula UI-B), which may then be reacted with a haJogenating agent to obtain the 4-ha]ogeno-2-(4-fluorophenyljimin&gt;-5,6-dimethylpyrimidine of fonnula (U-A).<br>
4-Fluorophenylguanidine carbonate of formula (IV), which is used as the starting material for preparing the compound of formula (II-A) in the reaction scheme 2, can readily be prepared from 4-fluoroaniline using known methods (see, for example, European Patent No. 0.560.726). Specifically, the desired 4-fluorophenylguanidine carbonate can he prepared by reacting 4-fluoroaniline with a 50% cyanamide solution under acidic conditions using 30% to 37% hydrochloric acid while maintaining the temperature ranging from 751 to 95 "C.<br>
The first step of the reaction scheme 2 may be .practiced in the presence of a solvent. Solvents which may he used for this purpose include acetonitrile, N.N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. This<br>
/eaction is preferably carried out at a temperature-ranging—f-reffi 110^ to 160 °C.<br>
In the second step of the reaction scheme 2, 4-hydroxy-2-(4~ fluorophenylarnino)-5,6-dimethylpyrimidine of formula (II-B) obtained from the first step of the reaction scheme 2 is converted into the compound of formula (II-A) by reacting the former with a halogenating agent. Halogenating agents which can be used for this purpose include phosphorus oxychloride, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride and phosphorus tribromide, This halogenation reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. Reaction solvents which can be used for this purpose include preferably l^N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, 1,2-dichloroethane and l,2-dichloroben2ene. It is preferable to maintain the reaction temperature in the range from 75°C to 951.<br>
Although the second step of the reaction scheme 2 can be<br>
practiced by isolating the intermediate after the first reaction step hns<br>
been completed, it is preferable to conduct the first and second steps in a<br>
single vessel.	Specifically, 4-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-5,6-<br>
dimelhylguanidine of formula (II-B) is prepared from 4-fluorophenyl-guanidine cabonate and then, without isolation, can be successively reacted with the halogenating agent to yield 4-halogeno-2-(4-fluoro-phenylaniino)-5,6-dimethylpyrimidine (II-A).<br>
The compound of formula (II-A), which is used as the starting material for preparation of the compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, is novel, as is the compound of formula (II-B) produced as the intermediate in the reaction scheme 2. Both novel compounds can be represented by the following formula (II). which is within the scope of the present invention,<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R represents hydroxy or a halogen.<br>
l-Methy{-l,2,3,4-tetyahydroisoquinoline of formula (III), which is also used as the starting material in the reaction scheme 1, is a known compound and can be preapred by known methods (see, for example, International Publication No. WO 94/14795). According to this known method, (R)- or (S)-l-methyI-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is prepared by reacting (R)- or (S)-methylben2ylamine with a -chloro- a -(methyl-thio)-acetylchloride and stannous chloride (SnCh) to produce (R)- or (S)-l-methyl-4-methylthio-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-3-one, respecti¬vely, then reacting the resulting compound with Raney nickel to remove a methylthio group, and finally adding a reducing agent. However, this method is disadvantageous, since a -chloro- a -(methylthin)-acetylchloride, which is used as the starting material, is both unstable and explosive, so that this method cannot be practiced on an industrial scale. Further, since the reaction step is long, the total yield is low, which makes this method uneconomical.<br>
The present inventors have long labored to find a more efficient method for producing l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. We have discovered that l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline can be employed economically and safely by successively reacting a -methylbenzylamine with 2-bromoethanol, a brominating agent, and a Lewis acid. Such a process for preparing l-methyl-l,2,3.4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is novel and is encompassed within the scope of the present invention. This novel process for preparing l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline is explained in more detail below.<br>
According to the present invention, l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinoline of formula (DI) can be prepared by reacting a-methyl¬benzylamine successively with 2-bromoethanol, a brominating agent and Lewis acid. The method of the present invention employs the following reaction scheme 3.<br>
(Scheme  Removed)<br>
All of the starting materials and reactants used in the reaction<br>
scheme 3 are known compounds and can be obtained as commercial<br>
products.	In the first step a -methylbenzylamine is reacted with<br>
2-bromoethann| tn produce N-(2-hydroxyethyl)- a -mcthylbenxylamine, which in turn is reacted with the brominating agent to produce N-(2-bromoethyD- a-methylbenzylamine hydrobromide. In the third step, N-(2-bromoethyD- a -methylbenzylamine hydrobromide is reacted with a Lewis acid to produce the desired l-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahyd.rotso-quinoline of formula (III).<br>
Reaction solvents which can be used in the first step include acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide. dichloromethane and 1,2-dichlorn-ethane and the reaction temperature is preferably maintained in the range from 4()"C to 60"C. Reaction solvents which can be used in the second step include 1,2-dichloroethane, acetic acid, water and 1,2-dichloro-benzene, and the reaction temperature is preferably maintained in the range from 110"C to 145"C. Brominating agents which can be used in this reaction include bromine, bromic aicd, aqueous bromic acid solution, and phosphorus trihromide.<br>
Although the first and second steps of the reaction scheme 3 can<br>
be practiced by isolating N-(2-hydroxyetIiy1)- a -methylbenzylamine produced as the intermediate after the first reaction step has been completed, it is preferable to conduct the first and second reaction steps without isolating the intermediate. Thus, the brominating agent is added to the vessel that contains the products of the first reaction step.<br>
Then, N-(2-bromoethyl)- a -methylbenzylamine produced in the second reaction step is cyclized by reaction with a Lewis acid to prepare the desired l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinnline of formula (Til). Reaction solvents which can be used in this reaction include decalin, 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dichlorobenzene and Lewis acids for this cyclization reaction include aluminum (III) chloride, zinc chloride and ferrous chloride.<br>
Since  l-methyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline can be economically prepared   according   to   the   above   method,    the   desired    5,6-dimethyl -2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-4-(l-methyl-l&gt;2,3,4-tecrahydroisoquinolin-2-y]) -pyrimidine of formula (I) according to the present invention can also be economically prepared using this compound as the reactant.<br>
In order to use the compound of formula (III) in the form of (U)-(*)- or (S)-(-)-isomer as the starting material for preparation of che compound of formula (I) according to the present invention, each isomeric form of the compound of formula (III) can be efficiently prepared using the corresponding (R)-(+)- or (S)-(-)-methylbenzylamine as the starting material used in the method depicted in the reaction scheme 3.<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in detail by the following<br>
" ^ examples.      However, it should be understood that the present invention<br>
is not in any manner limited by these examples.<br>
