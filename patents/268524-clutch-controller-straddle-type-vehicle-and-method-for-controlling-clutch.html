This application claims priority from Japanese<br>
Patent Application No. 2007-043645 filed on February 23,<br>
2007 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-231133 filed<br>
on September 6, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
controlling the degree of engagement of a clutch by<br>
actuating an actuator.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Related semi-automatic vehicles, which actuate an<br>
actuator to engage or disengage a clutch, use a technology<br>
for controlling relative positions of a drive-side member<br>
and a driven-side member of the clutch (the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch) based on a difference in<br>
rotational speed between these members during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch (for example, JP-A-2001-146930).<br>
The technology is designed to control the degree of<br>
engagement between the drive-side member and the driven-<br>
side member based on the difference in rotational speed<br>
therebetween. This, however, can prevent appropriate<br>
1<br><br>
torque from being constantly transmitted via the clutch,<br>
and thus can impair riding comfort during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch. For example, sharply increasing<br>
torque can be transmitted from the drive-side member to<br>
the driven-side member, which possibly impairs riding<br>
comfort. An additional technology is also proposed, in<br>
which a half-clutch state is maintained until the<br>
difference in rotational speed is almost zero. However,<br>
such control results in excessively low torque being<br>
continuously transmitted via the clutch for a long time<br>
period. Thus, the rider can perceive that the vehicle<br>
decelerates excessively.<br>
The present invention is made in view of the<br>
foregoing problems, and an object of the invention is to<br>
provide a clutch controller, a straddle-type vehicle, and<br>
a method for controlling a clutch which allow an<br>
appropriate amount of torque to be transmitted via the<br>
clutch and which prevent the clutch from spending too much<br>
time on its engaging operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the<br>
present invention is directed to a clutch controller<br>
including: an actuator for changing the degree of<br>
engagement between a drive-side member and a driven-side<br>
2<br><br>
member of a clutch; an actual torque obtaining section for<br>
obtaining torque transmitted from the drive-side member to<br>
a downstream mechanism of a torque transmission path as<br>
actual transmission torque, the downstream mechanism<br>
including the driven-side member; a target torque<br>
obtaining section for obtaining torque that is supposed to<br>
be transmitted from the drive-side member to the<br>
downstream mechanism as target transmission torque; and a<br>
control unit for controlling the degree of engagement of<br>
the clutch by actuating the actuator based on a difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque and the target<br>
transmission torque. The target torque obtaining section<br>
includes a determining section for determining whether or<br>
not a difference in rotational speed between the drive-<br>
side member and the driven-side member is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate, and depending on the determination<br>
result, corrects the target transmission torque.<br>
In addition, in order to solve the foregoing<br>
problems, the present invention is directed to a straddle-<br>
type vehicle including the clutch controller.<br>
Further, in order to solve the foregoing problems,<br>
the present invention is directed to a method for<br>
controlling a clutch, the method including the steps of:<br>
obtaining torque transmitted from a drive-side member of<br>
the clutch to a downstream mechanism in a torque<br>
3<br><br>
transmission path as actual transmission torque, the<br>
downstream mechanism including a driven-side member of the<br>
clutch; obtaining torque that is supposed to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member to the downstream<br>
mechanism as target transmission torque; controlling the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch by actuating an<br>
actuator based on a difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the target transmission torque;<br>
determining whether or not a difference in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member is reduced at an appropriate rate; and correcting<br>
the target transmission torque depending on the<br>
determination result from the determining step.<br>
The present invention allows an appropriate amount<br>
of torque to be transmitted via the clutch. The present<br>
invention also prevents the clutch from spending too much<br>
time on its engaging operation. More specifically, the<br>
rate-of-change of engine speed depends on a difference<br>
between torque outputted from an engine (hereinafter<br>
referred to as engine torque) and the actual transmission<br>
torque transmitted via the clutch. Therefore, setting the<br>
target transmission torque at a value close to the engine<br>
torque can cause the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the engine torque to be small. If<br>
this happens, the rate-of-change of engine speed decreases,<br>
4<br><br>
accordingly, and therefore, the difference in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member and the driven-side<br>
member is reduced at a lower rate. Thus, it takes the<br>
clutch too much time for its engaging operation.<br>
According to the present invention, it is determined<br>
whether or not the difference in rotational speed between<br>
the drive-side member and the driven-side member is<br>
reduced at an appropriate rate, and depending on the<br>
determination result, the target transmission torque is<br>
corrected. This prevents the clutch from spending too<br>
much time on its engaging operation. The straddle-type<br>
vehicle may be a motorcycle (including a scooter), a four-<br>
wheeled buggy or a snowmobile, for example.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
below with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a side<br>
view of a motorcycle 1 provided with a clutch controller<br>
10 as an example of the embodiment of the invention. FIG.<br>
2 is a schematic view of a mechanism located on a torque<br>
transmission path of the motorcycle 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2, the motorcycle 1 is<br>
provided not only with the clutch controller 10, but also<br>
with an engine 30, a primary speed reducing mechanism 36,<br>
a clutch 40, a secondary speed reducing mechanism 50, a<br>
front wheel 2, and a rear wheel 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the front wheel 2 is located at<br>
a front part of a vehicle body, and supported by lower<br>
7<br><br>
ends of a front fork 4. Handlebars 5 are connected to the<br>
top of the front fork 4. An acceleration grip 5a to be<br>
gripped by a rider is mounted to the right end of the<br>
handlebars 5. The acceleration grip 5a is connected to a<br>
throttle valve 37a provided in a throttle body 37 (see FIG.<br>
2). The throttle valve 37a is opened according to rider'<br>
s accelerator operation, and a certain amount of air,<br>
which depends on the opening of the throttle valve 37a, is<br>
delivered to the engine 30. The motorcycle 1 may be<br>
provided with an electronically-controlled throttle device.<br>
In this case, a sensor for detecting the rider ' s<br>
accelerator operation and an actuator for opening the<br>
throttle valve 37a according to the accelerator operation<br>
detected by the sensor are provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the engine 30 has a cylinder 31,<br>
a piston 32, an intake port 33, and a crankshaft 34. The<br>
throttle body 37 is connected to the intake port 33 via an<br>
intake pipe 35.<br>
The throttle valve 37a is placed within an intake<br>
passage of the throttle body 37. Mixture of air, which<br>
flows through the intake passage of the throttle body 37,<br>
and fuel, which is supplied from a fuel supplier (not<br>
shown, for example, injector or carburetor), is delivered<br>
to an interior of the cylinder 31. A spark plug 31a faces<br>
the interior of the cylinder 31 in order to ignite the<br>
8<br><br>
air-fuel mixture within the cylinder 31. Burning the air-<br>
fuel mixture causes the piston 32 to reciprocate within<br>
the cylinder 31. The reciprocating motion of the piston<br>
32 is converted into rotating motion by the crankshaft 34,<br>
thereby outputting torque from the engine 30.<br>
The primary speed reducing mechanism 36 includes: a<br>
drive-side primary reduction gear 36a, which operates in<br>
conjunction with the crankshaft 34; and a driven-side<br>
primary reduction gear 36b, which meshes with the primary<br>
reduction gear 36a. The primary speed reducing mechanism<br>
36 decelerates the rotation of the crankshaft 34 at a<br>
predetermined gear ratio.<br>
The clutch 40 transmits torque outputted from the<br>
engine 30 to the downstream side of the clutch 40 or<br>
interrupts transmission of the torque. The clutch 40 is a<br>
friction clutch, for example, and is provided with a<br>
drive-side member 41 and a driven-side member 42. The<br>
drive-side member 41 includes a friction disk, for example,<br>
and rotates together with the primary reduction gear 36b.<br>
The driven-side member 42 includes a clutch disk, for<br>
example, and rotates together with a main shaft 52. The<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are<br>
pressed against each other by elastic force of a clutch<br>
spring 44 at the time of engaging the clutch 40, so that<br>
the torque of the engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-<br>
9<br><br>
side member 41 to the driven-side member 42. In turn, at<br>
the time of disengaging the clutch 40, the driven-side<br>
member 42 and the drive-side member 41 are moved away from<br>
each other, so that torque transmission from the drive-<br>
side member 41 is interrupted. The clutch controller 10<br>
is provided with a clutch actuator 14 as will be discussed<br>
later. The clutch actuator 14 performs engaging operation<br>
of the clutch 40 (switching from the disengaged state to<br>
the engaged state) and disengaging operation thereof<br>
(switching from the engaged state to the disengaged state).<br>
The secondary speed reducing mechanism 50 is<br>
designed to decelerate the rotation of the main shaft 52<br>
and transmit the decelerated rotation to an axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the secondary speed<br>
reducing mechanism 50 is provided with a gearbox 51 and a<br>
transmission mechanism 57. The gearbox 51 is a mechanism<br>
to change reduction ratios, such as a constant-mesh<br>
gearbox and a selective-sliding gearbox.<br>
The gearbox 51 has on the main shaft 52 plural<br>
shift gears 53a (for example, first-speed gear, second-<br>
speed gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 53b<br>
(for example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). Also,<br>
the gearbox 51 has on the countershaft 55 plural shift<br>
gears 54a (for example, first-speed gear, second-speed<br>
gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 54b (for<br>
10<br><br>
example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). The shift<br>
gears 53a are spline-connected to the main shaft 52 and<br>
operates in conjunction with the main shaft 52. The shift<br>
gears 54a are provided such that they run idle to the<br>
countershaft, 55, and mesh with the shift gears 53a,<br>
respectively. The shift gears 53b are provided such that<br>
they run idle to the main shaft 52. The shift gears 54b<br>
mesh with the corresponding shift gears 53b respectively,<br>
while being spline-connected to the countershaft 55 to<br>
operate in conjunction with the countershaft 55.<br>
The gearbox 51 is also provided with a gearshift<br>
mechanism 56. The gearshift mechanism 56 includes a shift<br>
fork and a shift drum, for example, and selectively moves<br>
the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b in the axial direction<br>
of the main shaft 52 or the countershaft 55. Then, the<br>
gearshift mechanism 56 causes the shift gears 53b, 54a,<br>
which are provided to turn free to the corresponding<br>
shafts, to connect with the adjacent shift gears 53a, 54b,<br>
which operate in conjunction with the corresponding shafts.<br>
This changes the pairs of shift gears to transmit torque<br>
from the main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55. The<br>
gearshift mechanism 56 is actuated by power inputted from<br>
a shift actuator 16 to be discussed later.<br>
The transmission mechanism 57 is designed to<br>
decelerate the rotation of the countershaft 55 and<br>
11<br><br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to the axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the transmission mechanism<br>
57 includes: a drive-side member 57a (for example, drive-<br>
side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with the<br>
countershaft 55; a driven-side member 57b (for example,<br>
driven-side sprocket), which operates in conjunction with<br>
the axle 3a; and a transmission member 57c (for example,<br>
chain), which transmits torque from the drive-side member<br>
57a to the driven-side member 57b.<br>
Torque outputted from the engine 30 is transmitted<br>
to the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40 via the<br>
primary speed reducing mechanism 36. The torque<br>
transmitted to the drive-side member 41 is transmitted to<br>
the axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 via the driven-side member<br>
42, the gearbox 51, and the transmission mechanism 57, in<br>
the case that the clutch 40 is engaged or the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 contact each other,<br>
that is, the clutch 40 is in a half-clutch state.<br>
Now, a configuration of the clutch controller 10 is<br>
described. The motorcycle 1 is a semi-automatic vehicle<br>
which changes the shift gears of the gearbox 51 without<br>
the need for the rider to operate the clutch. The clutch<br>
controller 10 controls the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40 (relative positions of the drive-side member 41<br>
and the driven-side member 42) during engaging operation<br>
12<br><br>
thereof, and changes the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of<br>
the clutch controller 10. As shown in FIG. 3, the clutch<br>
controller 10 is provided with a control unit 11, a<br>
storage unit 12, a clutch actuator drive circuit 13, a<br>
clutch actuator 14, a shift actuator drive circuit 15, a<br>
shift actuator 16, a spark plug drive circuit 24, an<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, an engine speed<br>
detector 18, a vehicle speed detector 19, a gear position<br>
detector 21, a clutch position detector 22, and clutch<br>
rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. The control unit 11<br>
is connected to a shift-up switch 9a and a shift-down<br>
switch 9b.<br>
The control unit 11 includes a central processing<br>
unit (CPU) . In accordance with programs stored in the<br>
storage unit 12, the control unit 11 changes the shift<br>
gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b of the gearbox 51 according to<br>
the rider ' s gearshift operation (in this example,<br>
switching the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down switch<br>
9b ON), while controlling the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40. The processing executed by the control unit 11<br>
will be discussed in detail later.<br>
The storage unit 12 includes a nonvolatile memory<br>
and a volatile memory. The storage unit 12 stores in<br>
advance programs executed by the control unit 11 and<br>
13<br><br>
tables or expressions used for the processing in the<br>
control unit 11. These tables and expressions will be<br>
discussed in details later.<br>
The clutch actuator drive circuit 13 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current the clutch actuator 14 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the control<br>
unit 11. The clutch actuator 14 includes, for example, a<br>
motor and a power transmission mechanism (such as<br>
hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving the<br>
electric power supplied by the clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13. In this example, the clutch actuator 14<br>
presses a push rod 43 or releases the pressed push rod 43.<br>
When the push rod 43 is pressed by the clutch actuator 14,<br>
it moves the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 away from each other against the elastic force<br>
of the clutch spring 44, so that the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged. In contrast, when the pressed push rod 43 is<br>
released by the clutch actuator 14, it returns to its<br>
original position (the position at the time when the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged) using the elastic force of the<br>
clutch spring 44. Thus, the drive-side member 41 and the<br>
driven-side member 42 approach each other, so that the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged. In addition, the clutch actuator 14<br>
puts the clutch 40 to be in a half-clutch state during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. When the clutch 40<br>
14<br><br>
is in a half-clutch state, only part of torque of the<br>
engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to<br>
the driven-side member 42.<br>
The shift actuator drive circuit 15 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current to the shift actuator 16 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the control<br>
unit 11. The shift actuator 16 includes, for example, a<br>
motor and a power transmission mechanism (such as<br>
hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving the<br>
electric power supplied from the shift actuator drive<br>
circuit 15. The shift actuator 16 actuates the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 to change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b<br>
to transmit torque from the main shaft 52 to the<br>
countershaft 55, in order to change the reduction ratios.<br>
The spark plug drive circuit 24 switches electric<br>
current ON or OFF, the electric current being supplied to<br>
drive the spark plug 31a, according to a control signal<br>
inputted from the control unit 11. The spark plug 31a<br>
ignites at the time when the electric current is switched<br>
ON or OFF.<br>
The accelerator operation detector 17 is designed<br>
to detect an amount of the accelerator operation by the<br>
rider (hereinafter referred to as accelerator<br>
displacement). Examples of the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17 are a throttle position sensor for detecting a<br>
15<br><br>
throttle opening and an accelerator position sensor<br>
mounted to the accelerator grip 5a to detect a rotation<br>
angle of the accelerator grip 5a. Based on the signal<br>
outputted from the accelerator operation detector 17, the<br>
control unit 11 detects the accelerator displacement by<br>
the rider.<br>
The engine speed detector 18 is designed to detect<br>
a rotational speed of the engine 30 (hereinafter referred<br>
to as engine speed). Example of the engine speed detector<br>
18 are a crank angle sensor for outputting a pulse signal<br>
with a frequency according to the rotational speed of the<br>
crankshaft 43 or the primary reduction gears 36a, 36b and<br>
a tachogenerator for outputting a voltage signal according<br>
to the rotational speed thereof. The control unit 11<br>
calculates the engine speed based on the signal inputted<br>
from the engine speed detector 18.<br>
The vehicle speed detector 19 is designed to detect<br>
a vehicle speed and outputs a signal to the control unit<br>
11 according to, for example, the rotational speed of the<br>
axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 or that of the countershaft 55<br>
The control unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed based on<br>
the signal inputted from the vehicle speed detector 19.<br>
The vehicle speed detector 19 may output a signal to the<br>
control unit 11 according to the rotational speed of the<br>
main shaft 52. In this case, the control unit 11<br>
16<br><br>
calculates the vehicle speed not only based on the input<br>
signal, but also based on the reduction ratio of the<br>
gearbox 51 and that of the transmission mechanism 57.<br>
The gear position detector 21 is designed to detect<br>
positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b provided<br>
movably in the axial direction of the countershaft 55 or<br>
the main shaft 52. An example of the gear position<br>
detector 21 is a potentiometer mounted to the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 or the shift actuator 16. The gear position<br>
detector 21 outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b,<br>
54a, 54b. Based on the input signal, the control unit 11<br>
detects that movements of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a,<br>
54b, which are associated with the gear shifting, have<br>
been completed.<br>
The clutch position detector 22 is designed to<br>
detect the degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
Examples of the clutch position detector 22 are a<br>
potentiometer for outputting a signal according to the<br>
position of the push rod 43 and a potentiometer for<br>
outputting a signal according to the position or the<br>
rotation angle of the output shaft of the clutch actuator<br>
14. Based on the signal inputted from the clutch position<br>
detector 22, the control unit 11 detects the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
17<br><br>
The clutch rotational speed detector 23a is<br>
designed to detect the rotational speed of the drive-side<br>
member 41 (hereinafter referred to as rotational speed of<br>
the drive-side member 41). Examples of the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23a are a rotary encoder for<br>
outputting a pulse signal with a frequency according to<br>
the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41 and a<br>
tachogenerator for outputting a voltage signal according<br>
to the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41. In<br>
turn, the clutch rotational speed detector 23b is designed<br>
to detect the rotational speed of the driven-side member<br>
42 (hereinafter referred to as rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42). Examples of the clutch rotational<br>
speed detector 23b are a rotary encoder and a<br>
tachogenerator, as described for the clutch rotational<br>
speed detector 23a.<br>
The shift-up switch 9a and the shift-down switch 9b<br>
are designed for the rider to provide instructions to<br>
change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to the clutch<br>
controller 11. These switches 9a, 9b output a signal to<br>
the control unit 11 according to the gear shift<br>
instructions. The control unit 11 actuates the shift<br>
actuator 16 according to the input signal to change the<br>
shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to transmit torque from the<br>
main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55. The shift-up switch<br>
18<br><br>
9a and the shift-down switch 9b are provided adjacent to<br>
the accelerator grip 5a, for example.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the control unit 11. During engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, the control unit 11 obtains torque Tac<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to a downstream<br>
mechanism (such as the driven-side member 42 or the<br>
countershaft 55 and the axle 3a located downstream of the<br>
driven-side member 42 in this example) in the torque<br>
transmission path including the driven-side member 42<br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred to as actual<br>
transmission torque). In addition, the control unit 11<br>
obtains torque Ttg which is supposed to be transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member 41 to the downstream mechanism<br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred to as target<br>
transmission torque). Then, the control unit 11 actuates<br>
the actuator 14 based on the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg to control the degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
FIGs. 4(a) to 4(d) are time charts for describing<br>
the overview of the control by means of the control unit<br>
11. FIG. 4(a) shows an example of changes in degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 at the time of gear shifting.<br>
FIG. 4(b) shows an example of changes in actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. FIG. 4(c) shows an example of<br>
19<br><br>
changes in target transmission torque Ttg. FIG. 4(d)<br>
shows an example of changes in engine speed. A broken<br>
line in FIG. 4(b) shows changes in torque TEac outputted<br>
from the engine 30 (torque transmitted from the engine 30<br>
via the primary speed reducing mechanism 36 to the drive-<br>
side member 41 in this description (hereinafter referred<br>
to as EG torque) ) . Here, description is made for the<br>
shift-up operation as an example.<br>
At the time tl, when the rider turns the shift-up<br>
switch 9a ON, the control unit 11 allows the clutch 40 to<br>
be disengaged, as shown in FIG. 4 (a) . Consequently, as<br>
shown in FIG. 4(b), the actual transmission torque Tac is<br>
0. At the time t2, the control unit 11 starts engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40 after some of the shift gears<br>
53a, 53b, 54a, 54b have been already moved.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIG. 4(c), the control<br>
unit 11 sets the target transmission torque Ttg, while<br>
actuating the clutch actuator 14 such that the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac approximates the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Thereby, as shown in FIG. 4(a),<br>
the clutch AQ is switched from the disengaged state to the<br>
half-clutch state. While the clutch 40 is in the half-<br>
clutch state, the degree of engagement of the clutch 40 is<br>
enhanced gradually. Consequently, as shown in FIGs. 4(b)<br>
and 4(c), the actual transmission torque Tac reaches the<br>
20<br><br>
target transmission torque Ttg at the time t3. After that,<br>
the control unit 11 also actuates the clutch actuator 14<br>
such that the actual transmission torque Tac follows the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. Then, as shown in FIG.<br>
4 (a) , the control unit 11 allows the clutch 40 to be<br>
completely engaged at the point in time (t4) when the<br>
difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member 41 and the driven-side member 42 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as clutch rotational speed difference) is<br>
smaller than a predetermined value (for example, 0 or<br>
close to 0, hereinafter referred to as rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch).<br>
In addition, at the time of shift-up operation, the<br>
control unit 11 controls the engine to reduce the EG<br>
torque TEac (for example, retarding control). Thus, as<br>
shown by the broken line in FIG. 4(b), the EG torque TEac<br>
is lower at the time tl than the past values of the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. Then, at the time t2, when the<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac increases and is higher than the<br>
EG torque TEac. When the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
is higher than the EG torque TEac, not only the EG torque<br>
TEac, but also the torque produced due to the inertia of<br>
the engine 30 and the primary speed reducing mechanism 36<br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred to as inertia torque<br>
21<br><br>
TIac) are transmitted as the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac. Thus, in this case, as shown by the solid line in<br>
FIG. 4(d), the engine speed decreases gradually from the<br>
time t2 to t4 at a rate according to the difference<br>
between the EG Torque TEac and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac. Generally, the engine output characteristics<br>
show that the EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed<br>
decreases. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4(b), the EG torque<br>
TEac increases from the time t2 to t4 as the engine speed<br>
decreases. The engine speed increases or decreases in<br>
such a manner during engaging operation of the clutch 40.<br>
This eliminates the clutch rotational speed difference at<br>
the time t4, and therefore, the half-clutch state is<br>
discontinued under the aforementioned control by the<br>
control unit 11. At the time t4 when the drive-side<br>
member 41 is completely engaged with the driven-side<br>
member 42, the control unit 11 stops the aforementioned<br>
engine control designed to reduce the EG torque TEac.<br>
Therefore, the EG torque TEac increases at the time t4.<br>
Under such control that the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac approximates the target transmission torque Ttg,<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
excessively low rate, which can require a long time for<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. Specifically, if the<br>
difference is small between the EG torque TEac and the<br>
22<br><br>
actual transmission torque Tac, the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is reduced at a low rate. The reasons<br>
for this event are described below.<br>
As described above, the engine speed increases or<br>
decreases at a rate according to the difference between<br>
the EG torque TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
In other words, as shown in FIGs. 4(a) to 4(d), if the EG<br>
Torque TEac is lower than the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac, the inertia torque TIac of the engine 30 is<br>
transmitted as part of the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
via the clutch 40. Thus, the engine speed decreases at a<br>
rate according to the difference between the EG torque<br>
TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac or according<br>
to the inertia torque TIac. In contrast, if the EG torque<br>
TEac is higher than the actual transmission torque Tac,<br>
the difference therebetween contributes to an increase in<br>
engine speed, and the increasing rate depends on the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. Under the aforementioned control<br>
such that the actual transmission torque Tac approximates<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg, setting the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value close to the EG torque<br>
TEac results in a smaller difference between the EG torque<br>
TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch. In this case, the<br>
23<br><br>
engine speed increases or decreases at an excessively low<br>
rate, and accordingly, the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is reduced at a lower rate. Thus, it takes the<br>
clutch 40 too much time for its engaging operation.<br>
In order to avoid such a situation, the control<br>
unit 11 determines whether or not the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is reduced at an appropriate rate, and<br>
according to the determination result, corrects the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Specifically, as shown by the<br>
phantom line Ll in FIG. 4 (c), the control unit 11 corrects<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg to increase the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the EG torque TEac. This results in a larger difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac during engaging operation of the clutch, as<br>
shown in the phantom line L2 in FIG. 4(b) . Thereby, as<br>
shown by the phantom line L3 in FIG. 4(d), the engine<br>
speed decreases at a higher rate, and therefore, it takes<br>
a shorter time until the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is below the rotational speed difference for<br>
discontinuing half-clutch. Up to this point, the<br>
discussion has focused on the overview of the control by<br>
means of the control unit 11. The processing executed by<br>
the control unit 11 will be discussed below in details.<br>
FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the<br>
24<br><br>
processing functions of the control unit 11. As shown in<br>
FIG. 5, the control unit 11 includes: an actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a; a target torque obtaining section<br>
lid; a clutch actuator control section 11j; a shift<br>
actuator control section Ilk; and gear shifting engine<br>
control section 11L. The actual torque obtaining section<br>
11a includes an EG torque obtaining section lib and an<br>
inertia torque obtaining section lie. In turn, the target<br>
torque obtaining section lid includes a post-completion<br>
torque obtaining section lie and a correction processing<br>
section llh.<br>
Description is first made of the actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a. The actual torque obtaining<br>
section 11a calculates the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
based on the EG torque TEac and the torque TIac produced<br>
due to the inertia of the mechanism (such as the<br>
crankshaft 34, the piston 32 and the primary speed<br>
reducing mechanism 36) upstream of the drive-side member<br>
41 in the torque transmission path (hereinafter the torque<br>
is referred to as inertia torque). The actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a executes this processing in a<br>
predetermined sampling cycle (for example, several<br>
milliseconds) during engaging operation of the clutch 40.<br>
The actual transmission torque Tac is herein described as<br>
torque transmitted to the driven-side member 42 in the<br>
25<br><br>
mechanism downstream of the drive-side member 41.<br>
Description is first made of the processing for<br>
obtaining the EG torque TEac. The storage unit 12 stores<br>
in advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG torque TEac, and the engine speed and the<br>
accelerator displacement (hereinafter the table is<br>
referred to as EG torque table) . Then, the EG torque<br>
obtaining section lib detects the accelerator displacement<br>
based on the signal inputted from the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17, while detecting the engine speed<br>
based on the signal inputted from the engine speed<br>
detector 18. Then, the EG torque obtaining section lib<br>
refers to the EG torque table to obtain the EG torque TEac<br>
that corresponds to the detected accelerator displacement<br>
and engine speed.<br>
In place of the EG torque table, the storage unit<br>
12 may store in advance an expression that represents the<br>
relationship between the engine speed, the accelerator<br>
displacement and the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as EG torque relational<br>
expression). In this case, the EG torque obtaining<br>
section lib substitutes the detected engine speed and<br>
accelerator displacement into the EG torque relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the EG torque TEac.<br>
Alternatively, the EG torque obtaining section lib<br>
26<br><br>
may obtain the EG torque TEac based on pressure of air<br>
flowing through the interior of the intake pipe 35<br>
(hereinafter the pressure is referred to as intake<br>
pressure) . For example, the storage unit 12 may store in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG torque TEac, and the intake pressure and<br>
the engine speed. In addition, a pressure sensor for<br>
outputting a signal according to the intake pressure is<br>
disposed in the intake pipe 35. In this case, the EG<br>
torque obtaining section lib detects the engine speed at<br>
the time when the crank angle is a predetermined value<br>
(for example, at the end of intake stroke) , while<br>
detecting the intake pressure based on the signal inputted<br>
from the pressure sensor. Then, the EG torque obtaining<br>
section lib refers to the table stored in the storage unit<br>
12 to obtain the EG torque TEac that corresponds to the<br>
detected intake pressure and engine speed.<br>
The inertia torque TIac is a value determined<br>
according to the variation in engine speed Qe per unit<br>
time (dQe / dt, hereinafter referred to as rate-of-change<br>
of EG speed) . The storage unit 12 stores in advance an<br>
expression that associates the inertia torque TIac with<br>
the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) . Specifically,<br>
the storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression, in<br>
which the inertia torque TIac is equal to a value (I x<br>
27<br><br>
(dQe / dt)) obtained by multiplying the inertial moment I<br>
on the mechanism upstream of the drive-side member 41 by<br>
the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt). In this case,<br>
the inertia torque obtaining section lie calculates the<br>
rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) based on the signal<br>
inputted from the engine speed detector 18. Then, the<br>
inertia torque obtaining section lie multiplies the rate-<br>
of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) by the inertial moment I,<br>
and defines the multiplication result (I x (dQe / dt) ) as<br>
inertia torque TIac. The storage unit 12 may store in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) and the<br>
inertia torque TIac. In this case, the inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie refers to the table to obtain the<br>
inertia torque TIac that corresponds to the rate-of-change<br>
of EG speed (dQe / dt).<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a substitutes<br>
the EG torque TEac and the inertia torque TIac, which are<br>
obtained from the aforementioned processing, into the<br>
expression stored in advance in the storage unit 12 and<br>
representing the relationship between the EG torque TEac,<br>
the inertia torque TIac and the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac, in order to calculate the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac. For example, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
substitutes these EG torque TEac and inertia torque TIac<br>
28<br><br>
into the following expression (1).<br>
Tac = TEac - TIac 	(1)<br>
The torque transmitted to the driven-side member 42<br>
in the mechanism located downstream of the drive-side<br>
member 41 is herein described as actual transmission<br>
torque Tac. However, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
11a may calculate torque transmitted to the countershaft<br>
55 or the mechanism downstream of the countershaft 55 as<br>
actual transmission torque Tac, for example. In this case,<br>
the actual torque obtaining section 11a obtains torque by<br>
multiplying the value, which is obtained from the<br>
aforementioned expression (1), by the reduction ratio of<br>
the gearbox 51 after the end of gear shifting (the gear<br>
ratio of the shift gears after shift-up or shift-down<br>
operation) and by the reduction ratio of the transmission<br>
mechanism 57, and defines the obtained torque as actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
In addition, when the torque produced on the<br>
mechanism upstream of the primary speed reducing mechanism<br>
36 is stored as EG torque TEac in the aforementioned EG<br>
torque table, the actual torque obtaining section 11a<br>
multiplies the EG torque TEac, which is obtained from the<br>
aforementioned processing, by the reduction ratio of the<br>
primary speed reducing mechanism 36 (the number of teeth<br>
of the driven-side primary reduction gear 36b / the number<br>
29<br><br>
of teeth of the drive-side primary reduction gear 36a) in<br>
order to calculate the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
The processing for calculating the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is not limited to the<br>
aforementioned processing. For example, the storage unit<br>
12 may store in advance a table or an expression that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, and the engine speed, the<br>
accelerator displacement and the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed. In this case, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
11a uses the table or the expression to directly obtain<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac from the engine speed,<br>
the rate-of-change of EG speed and the accelerator<br>
displacement.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the gear shifting engine control section 11L. At the<br>
time of gear shifting, if the rotational speed of the<br>
drive-side member 41 is higher than the rotational speed<br>
of the driven-side member 42, the gear shifting engine<br>
control section 11L controls the engine to reduce the<br>
torque outputted from the engine 30. For example, the<br>
gear shifting engine control section 11L controls the<br>
ignition timing of the spark plug 31a to retard it<br>
relative to the normal ignition timing (during normal<br>
driving with the clutch 40 completely engaged)<br>
30<br><br>
(hereinafter referred to as retarding control), thereby<br>
reducing the EG torque TEac. In other words, the gear<br>
shifting engine control section 11L causes the spark plug<br>
31a to ignite at a crank angle that reaches at a timing<br>
delayed from the crank angle at which the spark plug 31a<br>
ignites during normal driving.<br>
At the time of shift-up operation, some of the<br>
shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b, whose reduction ratios are<br>
relatively higher, are changed to the other shift gears,<br>
whose reduction ratios are relatively lower. Therefore,<br>
due to the changes between the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a,<br>
54b, the rotational speed of the driven-side member 42 is<br>
lower than the rotational speed of the drive-side member<br>
41. Thus, for example, at the time when the shift-up<br>
switch 9a is pressed down, the gear shifting engine<br>
control section 11L starts the retarding control.<br>
Alternatively, the gear shifting engine control section<br>
Ilk may actually calculate the difference in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42, and if the calculated difference in rotational<br>
speed is greater than 0, then may start the retarding<br>
control.<br>
In the middle of the retarding control, the<br>
aforementioned EG torque obtaining section lib calculates<br>
torque, which is reduced under the retarding control, as<br>
31<br><br>
EG torque TEac. For example, the storage unit 12 stores<br>
in advance torque to be reduced in the case when the<br>
retarding control is performed (hereinafter the torque is<br>
referred to as reduced torque). The EG torque obtaining<br>
section lib subtracts the reduced torque from the torque,<br>
which is obtained by referring to the EG torque table in<br>
the aforementioned processing, and defines the obtained<br>
value as EG torque TEac.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the target torque obtaining section lid. As described<br>
above, the target torque obtaining section lid includes<br>
the post-completion torque obtaining section lie. The<br>
post-completion torque obtaining section lie calculates<br>
torque (torque obtained at the time t4 in the example<br>
shown in FIGs. 4(a) to 4(d)) which is estimated to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40<br>
to the mechanism (the driven-side member 42 in this<br>
description) downstream of the drive-side member 41 after<br>
completion of the engagement of the clutch 40. Then, the<br>
post-completion torque obtaining section lie defines the<br>
calculated torque as target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Specifically, the post-completion torque obtaining section<br>
lie estimates torque TEfin to be outputted from the engine<br>
30 after completion of the engagement of the clutch 40<br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred to as post-completion<br>
32<br><br>
EG torque). In addition, the post-completion torque<br>
obtaining section lie estimates inertia torque TIfin to be<br>
produced on the mechanism upstream of the drive-side<br>
member 41 in the torque transmission path after completion<br>
of the clutch engagement (hereinafter the inertia torque<br>
is referred to as post-completion inertia torque). Then,<br>
based on the estimated post-completion EG torque TEfin and<br>
post-completion inertia torque TIfin, the post-completion<br>
torque obtaining section lie calculates torque Tfin to be<br>
estimated to be transmitted from the drive-side member 41<br>
to the driven-side member 42 after completion of the<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 (hereinafter the torque is<br>
referred to as post-completion transmission torque).<br>
Description is first made of the processing for<br>
estimating the post-completion EG torque TEfin. As shown<br>
in FIG. 5, the post-completion torque obtaining section<br>
lie includes a post-completion EG torque obtaining section<br>
llf. Before starting engaging operation of the clutch 40<br>
or during the engaging operation, the post-completion EG<br>
torque obtaining section llf calculates the rotational<br>
speed of the driven-side member 42 or the rotational speed<br>
of the mechanism downstream of the driven-side member 42,<br>
and based on the calculated rotational speed, estimates<br>
the engine speed Qfin after completion of the clutch<br>
engagement. Then, the post-completion EG torque obtaining<br>
33<br><br>
section llf estimates the post-completion EG torque TEfin<br>
based on the estimated engine speed Qfin and the<br>
accelerator displacement.<br>
For example, the post-completion EG torque<br>
obtaining section llf detects the current rotational<br>
speeds of the driven-side member 42 and the drive-side<br>
member 41, and calculates the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff between these detected rotational speeds.<br>
In addition, the post-completion EG torque obtaining<br>
section llf calculates the current engine speed Qe. Then,<br>
the post-completion EG torque obtaining section llf<br>
substitutes the calculated clutch rotational speed<br>
difference Qdiff and engine speed Qe into the expression<br>
stored in advance in the storage unit 12, and defines the<br>
obtained value as engine speed Qfin after completion of<br>
the clutch engagement. For example, the post-completion<br>
EG torque obtaining section llf substitutes the current<br>
clutch rotational speed difference Qdiff and engine speed<br>
Qe into the following expression (2), and defines the<br>
obtained value as engine speed Qfin after completion of<br>
the clutch engagement.<br>
Qfin = Qe - (Qdiff x Pratio) ■•■(2)<br>
In addition, the post-completion EG torque obtaining<br>
section llf detects the accelerator displacement based on<br>
the signal inputted from the accelerator displacement<br>
34<br><br>
detector 17. Then, for example, the post-completion EG<br>
torque obtaining section llf defines the torque, which<br>
corresponds to the engine speed Qfin and the accelerator<br>
displacement in the aforementioned EG torque table, as<br>
post-completion EG torque TEfin. In the expression (2),<br>
Pratio represents the reduction ratio of the primary speed<br>
reducing mechanism 36. In addition, the post-completion<br>
EG torque TEfin thus calculated is considered as torque<br>
estimated to be outputted from the engine 30 after<br>
completion of the clutch engagement under no retarding<br>
control.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing for<br>
estimating the post-completion inertia torque TIfin. As<br>
shown in FIG. 5, the post-completion torque obtaining<br>
section lie includes a post-completion inertia torque<br>
obtaining section llg. The post-completion inertia torque<br>
obtaining section llg estimates the post-completion<br>
inertia torque TIfin based on the current rate-of-change<br>
of the rotational speed (the variation in rotational speed<br>
per unit time (hereinafter referred to as rate-of-change<br>
of rotational speed)) of the mechanism (such as the<br>
driven-side member 42, the countershaft 55 and the axle<br>
3a) located downstream of the drive-side member 41 in the<br>
torque transmission path.<br>
Description is herein made of the processing for<br>
35<br><br>
estimating the post-completion inertia torque TIfin based<br>
on the rotational speed of the driven-side member 42 as<br>
the downstream mechanism. The post-completion inertia<br>
torque obtaining section llg calculates the current rate-<br>
of-change of rotational speed (dQcl / dt) of the driven-<br>
side member 42. Then, the post-completion inertia torque<br>
obtaining section llg substitutes the calculated rate-of-<br>
change of rotational speed (dQcl / dt) of the driven-side<br>
member 42 into, for example, the following expression (3)<br>
in order to calculate the post-completion inertia torque<br>
TIfin.<br>
TIfin = I x (dQcl / dt) x Pratio ■•■{3)<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression that<br>
represents the relationship between the current rate-of-<br>
change of rotational speed (dQcl / dt) of the driven-side<br>
member 42 and the post-completion inertia torque TIfin.<br>
Alternatively, the post-completion inertia torque<br>
obtaining section llg may estimate the post-completion<br>
inertia torque TIfin based on the rate-of-change of<br>
rotational speed of the countershaft 55, the axle 3a or<br>
the like, rather than based on the rate-of-change of<br>
rotational speed of the driven-side member 42. In this<br>
case, the post-completion inertia torque obtaining section<br>
llg multiplies the rate-of-change of rotational speed of<br>
the above mechanism by the gear ratio of a mechanism<br>
36<br><br>
located between the above mechanism and the engine 30 (for<br>
example, the gear ratio of the gearbox 51 and the gear<br>
ratio of the primary speed reducing mechanism 36 after the<br>
end of gear shifting) in order to calculate the post-<br>
completion inertia torque TIfin.<br>
The post-completion inertia torque obtaining<br>
section llg executes the processing for calculating the<br>
aforementioned post-completion inertia torque TIfin in a<br>
predetermined cycle (for example, several milliseconds)<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40. The post-<br>
completion inertia torque obtaining section llg may not<br>
necessarily calculate the rate-of-change of rotational<br>
speed (dQcl / dt) of the driven-side member 42 in a<br>
predetermined cycle, but alternatively, may calculate it<br>
immediately before the clutch 40 is disengaged (for<br>
example, several hundred milliseconds before the clutch 40<br>
starts being disengaged (the time tl in FIGs. 4(a) to<br>
4 (d) ) ) , and continue to use the calculated value for the<br>
subsequent processing during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch.<br>
The post-completion torque obtaining section lie<br>
substitutes the thus-calculated post-completion EG torque<br>
TEfin and post-completion inertia torque TIfin into an<br>
expression stored in advance in the storage unit 12 in<br>
order to calculate the post-completion transmission torque<br>
37<br><br>
Tfin. For example, the post-completion torque obtaining<br>
section lie substitutes the post-completion EG torque<br>
TEfin and the post-completion inertia torque TIfin into<br>
the following expression (4) in order to calculate the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin.<br>
Tfin = TEfin - TIfin 	(4)<br>
The post-completion torque obtaining section lie<br>
tentatively sets the target transmission torque Ttg at the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin thus calculated.<br>
In the event that no correction processing is performed by<br>
the correction processing section llh that will be<br>
discussed later, the target transmission torque Ttg, set<br>
by the post-completion torque obtaining section lie, is<br>
provided for the processing executed by the clutch<br>
actuator control section 11j.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the correction processing section llh. As shown in FIG.<br>
5, the correction processing section llh includes an<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi. The<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi determines whether<br>
or not the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced<br>
at an appropriate rate for engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40. Specifically, the appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi determines whether or not the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference or an operating condition of<br>
38<br><br>
the engine 30, which correlates with the rate at which the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference is reduced, satisfies a<br>
predetermined condition (hereinafter referred to as<br>
correction condition). The operating condition of the<br>
engine 30, which correlates with the rate at which the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference is reduced, is<br>
considered as, for example, the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac or the<br>
rate at which such difference is reduced, and the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg or the rate at which such<br>
difference is reduced. The appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi executes the processing as below, for example.<br>
The appropriateness determining section Hi<br>
calculates the difference between the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the EG torque TEac obtained from the<br>
aforementioned processing during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, and determines whether or not the calculated<br>
difference is smaller than a predetermined value<br>
(hereinafter referred to as correction condition torque<br>
difference). Then, if the calculated difference is<br>
smaller than the correction condition torque difference,<br>
the appropriateness determining section Hi determines<br>
that the aforementioned correction condition is satisfied.<br>
As described above, during engaging operation of the<br>
39<br><br>
clutch 40, the rate at which the engine speed increases or<br>
decreases is determined according to the difference<br>
between the EG torque TEac and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac. In turn, the rate at which the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is reduced is determined<br>
according to the rate at which the engine speed increases<br>
or decreases and the vehicle acceleration. Thus, as the<br>
difference is greater between the EG torque TEac and the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac, the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is reduced at an increased rate. In this<br>
example, the appropriateness determining section Hi thus<br>
determines whether or not the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is reduced at an appropriate rate based on the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
As described above, the control unit 11 controls<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40 such that the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac approximates the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (see FIGs. 4(a) to 4(d)). Thus,<br>
as a result that the difference between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the target transmission torque Ttg is smaller than the<br>
correction condition torque difference, the difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac is also smaller than the correction condition<br>
torque difference during engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
40<br><br>
Therefore, the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
reduced at a lower rate. Thus, the appropriateness<br>
determining section Hi may determine whether or not the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate based on the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
calculated by the post-completion torque obtaining section<br>
He (the post-completion transmission torque Tfin), rather<br>
than based on the difference between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the actual transmission torque Tac. Specifically, if<br>
the difference between the EG torque TEac and the post-<br>
completion transmission torque Tfin is smaller than the<br>
correction condition torque difference, the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi may determine that<br>
the aforementioned correction condition is satisfied.<br>
Alternatively, during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, the appropriateness determining section Hi may<br>
calculate the rate at which the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac is<br>
reduced, and based on the calculated reduction rate of the<br>
difference, determine whether or not the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is reduced at an appropriate rate.<br>
Specifically, during engaging operation of the clutch 40,<br>
the appropriateness determining section Hi may determine<br>
whether or not the rate at which the difference between<br>
41<br><br>
the EG torque TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
is reduced is smaller than a predetermined value<br>
(hereinafter referred to as correction condition reduction<br>
rate). Thus, if this reduction rate of the difference is<br>
smaller than the correction condition reduction rate, the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi may determine that<br>
the correction condition is satisfied.<br>
Alternatively, the appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi may calculate the rate at which the difference<br>
between the EG torque TEac and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg is reduced, and based on the calculated<br>
reduction rate of the difference, determine whether or not<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate. Specifically, during engaging operation<br>
of the clutch 40, the appropriateness determining section<br>
Hi may determine whether or not the rate at which the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is reduced is smaller than the<br>
correction condition reduction rate. Then, if the thus-<br>
calculated reduction rate of the difference is smaller<br>
than the correction condition reduction rate, the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi may determine that<br>
the aforementioned correction condition is satisfied.<br>
In addition, the operating condition of the engine<br>
30, which correlates with the rate at which the clutch<br>
42<br><br>
rotational speed difference is reduced, may be accelerator<br>
displacement or engine speed. In this case, the storage<br>
unit 12 stores in advance the engine speed, and the<br>
accelerator displacement by which the engine speed is<br>
estimated to increase or decrease at a lower rate. Then,<br>
the appropriateness determining section Hi detects the<br>
accelerator displacement and the engine speed in a<br>
predetermined cycle during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, and determines whether or not the detected<br>
accelerator displacement and engine speed correspond with<br>
the accelerator displacement and the engine speed stored<br>
in advance in the storage unit 12, respectively. Then, if<br>
the detected accelerator displacement and engine speed<br>
respectively correspond with the thus-stored accelerator<br>
displacement and engine speed, the appropriateness<br>
determining section Hi may determine that the correction<br>
condition is satisfied.<br>
Alternatively, during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, the appropriateness determining section Hi may<br>
actually calculate the rate at which the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is reduced, and based on the calculated<br>
reduction rate, determine whether or not the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is reduced at an appropriate<br>
rate. Specifically, if this calculated reduction rate is<br>
lower than a predetermined value, the appropriateness<br>
43<br><br>
determining section Hi may determine that the correction<br>
condition is satisfied.<br>
Now, description is made of the correction<br>
processing executed by the correction processing section<br>
llh. If the aforementioned appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi determines that the correction condition is<br>
satisfied, the correction processing section llh corrects<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg that has been set at<br>
the post-completion transmission torque Tfin in the<br>
processing executed by the post-completion torque<br>
obtaining section He. Specifically, the correction<br>
processing section llh corrects or increases the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the EG torque TEac based on the EG torque TEac. For<br>
example, the correction processing section llh adds or<br>
subtracts a predetermined value ATmin (for example, the<br>
aforementioned correction condition torque difference) to<br>
or from the EG torque TEac, and defines the obtained value<br>
as corrected target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
If the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41<br>
is higher than the rotational speed of the driven-side<br>
member 42, the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
eliminated by decreasing the rotational speed of the<br>
drive-side member 41 to the rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42. Therefore, the actual transmission<br>
44<br><br>
torque Tac need be higher than the EG torque TEac. Thus,<br>
in this case, the correction processing section llh sets<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg at a value obtained by<br>
adding the correction condition torque difference ATmin to<br>
the EG torque TEac, in order to increase the difference<br>
between the EG torque TEac and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
In contrast, if the rotational speed of the drive-<br>
side member 41 is lower than the rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42, the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is eliminated by increasing the rotational<br>
speed of the drive-side member 41 to the rotational speed<br>
of the driven-side member 42. Therefore, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac need be lower than the EG torque<br>
TEac. Thus, in this case, the correction processing<br>
section llh sets the target transmission torque Ttg at a<br>
value obtained by subtracting the correction condition<br>
torque difference ATmin from the EG torque TEac, in order<br>
increase to the difference between the EG torque TEac and<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. In the processing in<br>
such a manner, the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATmin, which is added to the EG torque TEac, and the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATmin, which is<br>
subtracted from the EG torque TEac, may be difference<br>
values.<br>
45<br><br>
In addition, the correction processing executed by<br>
the correction processing section llh may not be limited<br>
to the aforementioned processing. For example, the<br>
correction processing section llh may multiply the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg, which is calculated by the post-<br>
completion torque obtaining section lie, by a<br>
predetermined correction coefficient k (k&gt;l), in order to<br>
increase the difference between the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg and the EG torque TEac.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the clutch actuator control section 11j. During<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40, the clutch actuator<br>
control section llj actuates the clutch actuator 14 in a<br>
predetermined cycle based on the difference between the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg (hereinafter referred to as torque deviation).<br>
Specifically, the clutch actuator control section llj<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 by an amount according to<br>
the torque deviation to allow the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac to approximate the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg. The clutch actuator control section llj executes the<br>
following processing, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression<br>
that represents the relationship between the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the amount by which the clutch<br>
46<br><br>
actuator 14 is actuated (hereinafter the amount is<br>
referred to as command actuation amount) (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as actuation amount relational<br>
expression) . The clutch actuator control section llj<br>
calculates the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) every time the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac is calculated during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. Then, the clutch<br>
actuator control section llj substitutes the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) into the actuation amount relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the command actuation<br>
amount, and outputs a control signal to the clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13 according to the calculated<br>
command actuation amount. The clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13 outputs electric power to drive the clutch<br>
actuator 14 according to the input control signal.<br>
FIG. 6 is a graph showing the relationship between<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the command actuation<br>
amount obtained from the actuation amount relational<br>
expression. In an example shown in FIG. 6, the actuation<br>
amount relational expression is established such that if<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to engage the<br>
clutch 40. In turn, the actuation amount relational<br>
expression is established such that if the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) is negative, the clutch actuator 14<br>
47<br><br>
is actuated in the direction to disengage the clutch 40.<br>
In addition, the actuation amount relational expression is<br>
established such that the command actuation amount<br>
increases in proportion to the torque deviation (Ttg -<br>
Tac) .<br>
The storage unit 12 stores the actuation amount<br>
relational expressions; The one expression is established<br>
to actuate the clutch actuator 14 in the direction to<br>
engage the clutch 40, if the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac)<br>
is positive as shown in FIG. 6 (hereinafter the expression<br>
is referred to as engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression). The other expression is established to<br>
actuate the clutch actuator 14 in the opposite direction<br>
or the direction to disengage the clutch 40 (hereinafter<br>
the expression is referred to as disengagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression). FIG. 7 is a graph showing<br>
the relationship between the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac)<br>
and the command actuation amount obtained from the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression. In<br>
the graph shown in FIG. 7, the actuation amount relational<br>
expression is established such that if the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive, the clutch actuator 14<br>
is actuated in the direction to disengage the clutch 40,<br>
in contrast to the graph shown in FIG. 6.<br>
The clutch actuator control section llj selects<br>
48<br><br>
either the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression or the disengagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression, depending on a positive or negative<br>
value of the clutch rotational speed difference.<br>
Specifically, if the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
positive, the clutch actuator control section 11j selects<br>
the engagement actuation amount relational expression to<br>
substitute the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) into the<br>
engagement actuation amount relational expression. In<br>
contrast, if the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
negative, the clutch actuator control section llj selects<br>
the disengagement actuation amount relational expression<br>
to substitute the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) into the<br>
disengagement actuation amount relational expression.<br>
Alternatively, in place of the engagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression and the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression, the storage unit<br>
12 may store a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the command actuation amount, and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac. In this case, the clutch actuator control section<br>
llj refers to the table, without calculating the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac), to directly obtain the command<br>
actuation amount that corresponds to the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque<br>
49<br><br>
Tac.<br>
The clutch actuator control section llj actuates<br>
the clutch actuator 14 by an amount according to the<br>
torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) for engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40. Consequently, when the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is below the aforementioned rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch<br>
actuator control section llj discontinues the half-clutch<br>
state to completely engage the drive-side member 41 with<br>
the driven-side member 42.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the shift actuator control section Ilk. When the rider<br>
operates the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down switch<br>
9b to input a gear shift command, the shift actuator<br>
control section Ilk actuates the shift actuator 16 to<br>
change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b. Specifically,<br>
after detecting that the clutch 40 is disengaged based on<br>
the signal inputted from the clutch position detector 22,<br>
the shift actuator control section Ilk outputs the control<br>
signal to the shift actuator drive circuit 15. The shift<br>
actuator 16 is actuated by the driving power supplied from<br>
the shift actuator drive circuit 15 in order to move some<br>
of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
Now, description is made of a flow of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11. FIG. 8 is a<br>
50<br><br>
flowchart showing an example of the processing executed by<br>
the control unit 11 at the time of gear shifting.<br>
When the rider turns the shift-up switch 9a or the<br>
shift-down switch 9b ON, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llj disengages the clutch 40 (step S101). The<br>
gear shifting engine control section 11L determined<br>
whether or not the shift-up command is inputted (step<br>
S102). In this step, if the shift-up command is inputted,<br>
the gear shifting engine control section 11L retards the<br>
ignition timing in the engine 30, thereby reducing the<br>
torque outputted from the engine 30 (step S103). In<br>
contrast, if the shift-down command, rather than the<br>
shift-up command, is inputted, the subsequent processing<br>
steps are executed, while maintaining the ignition timing<br>
in the engine 30 at the ignition timing for normal driving.<br>
After the clutch 40 is disengaged, the shift actuator<br>
control section Ilk actuates the shift actuator 16<br>
according to the gear shift command from the rider in<br>
order to move some of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b<br>
(step S104) .<br>
The control unit 11 starts engaging operation of<br>
the clutch 40 after detecting that some of the shift gears<br>
53a, 53b, 54a, 54b have been already moved based on the<br>
signal inputted from the gear position detector 21.<br>
Specifically, the EG torque obtaining section lib<br>
51<br><br>
calculates the EG torque TEac, while the actual torque<br>
obtaining section 11a calculates the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac based on the calculated EG torque TEac and the<br>
inertia torque TIac calculated by the inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie (step S105). In turn, the post-<br>
completion torque obtaining section lie calculates the<br>
torque Tfin, which is estimated to be transmitted from the<br>
drive-side member 41 to the driven-side member 42 after<br>
completion of the engagement of the clutch 4 0<br>
(hereinbefore the torque is referred to as post-completion<br>
transmission torque), and defines the calculated torque<br>
Tfin as tentative target transmission torque Ttg (step<br>
S106).<br>
After that, the appropriateness determining section<br>
Hi starts the processing for determining whether or not<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate during engaging operation of the clutch<br>
40. Specifically, first the appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi compares the rotational speed of the drive-<br>
side member 41 with the rotational speed of the driven-<br>
side member 42 (step S107). Then, if the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41 is relatively higher, the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi determines whether<br>
or not the difference between the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, calculated in the step S106, and the EG torque<br>
52<br><br>
TEac, calculated in the step S105, (Ttg - TEac) is smaller<br>
than a correction condition torque difference ATminl (step<br>
S108) . In this step, if the difference (Ttg - TEac) is<br>
smaller than the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATminl, the correction processing section llh adds the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATminl to the EG<br>
torque TEac, and sets the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
at the obtained value (TEac + ATminl), rather than at the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin (step S109).<br>
Then, the clutch actuator control section 11 j substitutes<br>
the difference between the corrected target transmission<br>
torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque Tac (Ttg -<br>
Tac) into the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression, in order to calculate the amount, by which the<br>
clutch actuator 14 is to be actuated, or the command<br>
actuation amount (step S110). In contrast, in the step<br>
S108, if the difference (Ttg - TEac) is not determined to<br>
be smaller than the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATminl, no correction processing is performed by the<br>
correction processing section llh, and the clutch actuator<br>
control section llj substitutes the difference between the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, which is set at the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin in the step S106, into the<br>
engagement actuation amount relational expression in order<br>
53<br><br>
to calculate the command actuation amount (step S110) .<br>
In turn, if the comparison result from the step<br>
S107 shows that the rotational speed of the drive-side<br>
member 41 is lower than the rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42, the appropriateness determining<br>
section Hi determines whether or not the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg, calculated in<br>
the step S106, and the EG torque TEac, calculated in the<br>
step S105, (TEac - Ttg) is smaller than a correction<br>
condition torque difference ATmin2 (step Sill) . In this<br>
step, if the difference (TEac - Ttg) is smaller than the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATmin2, the<br>
correction processing section llh subtracts the correction<br>
condition torque difference ATmin2 from the EG torque TEac,<br>
and sets the target transmission torque Ttg at the<br>
obtained value (TEac - ATmin2), rather than at the post-<br>
completion transmission torque Tfin (step S112). Then,<br>
the clutch actuator control section 11 j substitutes the<br>
difference between the corrected target transmission<br>
torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque Tac (Ttg -<br>
Tac) into the disengagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression, and calculates the command actuation amount<br>
(step S113) . In contrast, in the step Sill, if the<br>
difference (Ttg - TEac) is not determined to be smaller<br>
than the correction condition torque difference ATmin2, no<br>
54<br><br>
correction processing is performed by the correction<br>
processing section llh, and the clutch actuator control<br>
section 11j substitutes the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg, which is set at the post-completion transmission<br>
torque Tfin in the step S106, into the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression in order to<br>
calculate the command actuation amount (step S113) . When<br>
the command actuation amount is calculated in the step<br>
S110 or S113, the clutch actuator control section 11 j<br>
outputs a control signal to the clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13 according to the command actuation amount (step<br>
S114). Thereby, the clutch actuator 14 is actuated by the<br>
amount according to the command actuation amount, so that<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40 changes.<br>
After that, the clutch actuator control section llj<br>
calculates the clutch rotational speed difference, and<br>
determines whether or not the calculated clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is smaller than the rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch (step S115). In<br>
this step, if the calculated clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is smaller than the rotational speed difference<br>
for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llj completely engages the drive-side member 41<br>
with the driven-side member 42 to discontinue the half-<br>
55<br><br>
clutch state (step S116). Thereby, the control unit 11<br>
ends the processing for gear shifting. Simultaneously,<br>
the gear shifting engine control section 11L ends the<br>
retarding control. In contrast, in the step S115, if the<br>
calculated clutch rotational speed difference is not yet<br>
smaller than the rotational speed difference for<br>
discontinuing half-clutch, the control unit 11 returns to<br>
the step S105 to repeat the subsequent steps in a<br>
predetermined cycle (for example, several milliseconds)<br>
until the half-clutch state is discontinued in the step<br>
S116.<br>
The processing executed by the control unit 11 is<br>
not limited to the above-mentioned processing. For<br>
example, the correction condition torque difference ATminl,<br>
ATmin2 may not necessarily be a fixed value, but be<br>
determined depending on the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference. For example, the storage unit 12 may store a<br>
table that establishes the correspondence between the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATminl, ATmin2 and<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference. In this table,<br>
for example, the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATminl, ATmin2 is preset greater as the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is greater. In this case, the control<br>
unit 11 calculates the clutch rotational speed difference<br>
and corrects the target transmission torque Ttg based on<br>
56<br><br>
the correction condition torque difference ATminl, ATmin2<br>
that corresponds to the calculated clutch rotational speed<br>
difference.<br>
The description is made by using the example of the<br>
flowchart in FIG. 8. Prior to the step S108 or Sill, the<br>
control unit 11 calculates the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference and obtains the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATminl, ATmin2 that corresponds to the<br>
calculated clutch rotational speed difference. Then, in<br>
the step S108 or Sill, the control unit 11 compares the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATminl, ATmin2,<br>
obtained from the table, with the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the EG torque TEac. If<br>
the difference between the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
and the EG torque TEac is smaller than the correction<br>
condition torque difference ATminl, ATmin2, the control<br>
unit 11 adds the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATminl to the EG torque TEac in the step S109 or subtracts<br>
the correction condition torque difference ATmin2 from the<br>
EG torque TEac in the step Sill. Thereby, when the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is relatively large at the<br>
early stage of engaging operation of the clutch 40, the<br>
control unit 11 corrects the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg by a relatively large amount. This results in a<br>
higher rate-of-change of the engine speed. In contrast,<br>
57<br><br>
when the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40, the difference<br>
between the corrected target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the post-completion transmission torque Tfin is also<br>
reduced. Accordingly, the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin is reduced. Consequently,<br>
variations in the actual transmission torque Tac are<br>
minimized at the time of completely engaging the drive-<br>
side member 41 with the driven-side member 42, which<br>
reduces shocks produced on the vehicle.<br>
Description is made of changes in degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40, target transmission torque<br>
Ttg, actual transmission torque Tac and engine speed with<br>
respect to time in the case when the control discussed<br>
above is performed. FIGs. 9(a) to 9(d) through FIGs.<br>
12(a) to 12(d) are time charts respectively showing<br>
examples of changes in degree of engagement of the clutch<br>
40, target transmission torque Ttg, actual transmission<br>
torque Tac, EG torque TEac, and engine speed at the time<br>
of gear shifting. FIGs. 9(a), 10(a), 11(a), 12(a) show<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIGs. 9(b),<br>
10(b), 11(b), 12(b) show the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg and the EG torque TEac. FIGs. 9(c), 10(c), 11(c),<br>
12(c) show the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
58<br><br>
torque TEac. FIGs. 9(d), 10(d), 11(d), 12(d) show the<br>
engine speed.<br>
Description is first made for the shift-up<br>
operation with reference to FIGs. 9(a) to 9(d). In the<br>
example herein described, the rotational speed of the<br>
drive-side member 41 is higher than the rotational speed<br>
of the driven-side member 42, and the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin, which is calculated by the post-<br>
completion torque obtaining section lie, is high enough<br>
(the target transmission torque Ttg, which is set at the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin, is higher than<br>
the EG torque TEac by an amount equal to or greater than<br>
the correction condition torque difference ATminl).<br>
At the time tl, when the rider presses the shift-up<br>
switch 9a down, the clutch 40 is switched from the engaged<br>
state to the disengaged state, as shown in FIG. 9(a).<br>
Consequently, as shown in FIG. 9(c), the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is 0. Simultaneously, because the<br>
gear shifting engine control section 11L starts the<br>
retarding control, the EG torque TEac is lower than the<br>
past values of the actual transmission torque Tac. As<br>
described above, after the clutch 40 is switched to the<br>
disengaged state, the shift actuator control section Ilk<br>
moves some of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
At the time t2, when some of the shift gears 53a,<br>
59<br><br>
53b, 54a, 54b have been already moved, the post-completion<br>
torque obtaining section llf calculates the post-<br>
completion torque Tfin. The post-completion torque Tfin<br>
is considered as torque estimated to be transmitted via<br>
the clutch 40 after completion of the engagement of the<br>
clutch 40. In this example, the post-completion torque<br>
Tfin is the actual transmission torque Tac at the time t4.<br>
As described above, in the example herein described, the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin is higher than<br>
the EG torque TEac by an amount equal to or greater than<br>
the correction condition torque difference ATminl. Thus,<br>
at the time t2, the target transmission torque Ttg is set<br>
at the post-completion transmission torque Tfin, and no<br>
correction processing for the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is therefore performed.<br>
After the target transmission torque Ttg is set at<br>
the time t2, engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts.<br>
Specifically, under the control by the clutch actuator<br>
control section 11j, the clutch actuator 14 is actuated by<br>
an amount according to the difference between the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac. Thus, as shown in FIGs. 9(a) and 9(c), as the clutch<br>
40 is gradually closer to the engaged state, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac gradually approximates the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Then, at the time t3, the actual<br>
60<br><br>
transmission torque Tac reaches the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg. After that, the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac and the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is almost eliminated, and therefore, the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 is almost maintained, as shown<br>
in FIG. 9(a).<br>
As shown in FIG. 9(c), the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac exceeds the EG torque TEac in the process of<br>
its increase to the target transmission torque Ttg. Thus,<br>
as shown in FIG. 9(d), the engine speed starts decreasing<br>
gradually from the point in time when the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac exceeds the EG torque TEac.<br>
Thereby, the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
gradually closer to 0. Generally, the output<br>
characteristics of the engine 30 show that the EG torque<br>
TEac increases as the engine speed decreases. Thus, as<br>
shown in FIG. 9(c), the EG torque TEac gradually increases<br>
Consequently, the difference between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the actual transmission torque Tac is gradually<br>
reduced, and therefore, the engine speed decreases at a<br>
gradually lower rate, as shown in FIG. 9(d).<br>
At the time t4, when the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is smaller than the rotational speed difference<br>
for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch 40 is completely<br>
engaged, as shown in FIG. 9(a). In addition, the gear<br>
61<br><br>
shifting engine control section 11L ends the retarding<br>
control, and accordingly, the EG torque TEa-c increases, as<br>
shown in FIG. 9(c). As described above, in the processing<br>
for calculating the post-completion transmission torque<br>
Tfin, the post-completion EG torque TEfin, which is<br>
calculated by the post-completion EG torque obtaining<br>
section lie, is considered as torque estimated to be<br>
outputted from the engine 30 after completion of the<br>
clutch engagement under no retarding control. In addition,<br>
the rotational speed difference for discontinuing half-<br>
clutch is preset at 0 or close to 0. At the time t4, the<br>
drive-side member 41 is completely engaged with the<br>
driven-side member 42, resulting in 0 inertia torque TIac.<br>
This allows the actual transmission torque Tac to be kept<br>
almost constant at around the time t4 when the retarding<br>
control ends.<br>
Now, with reference to FIGs. 10(a) to 10(d),<br>
description is made of a case where the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41 is higher than the rotational<br>
speed of the driven-side member 42, and the post-<br>
completion transmission torque Tfin is relatively low<br>
(where the difference between the EG torque TEac and the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg set at the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin is smaller than the correction<br>
condition torque difference ATminl).<br>
62<br><br>
As in the case shown in FIGs. 9(a) to 9(d), at the<br>
time tl, when the rider presses the shift-up switch 9a<br>
down, the clutch 40 is switched from the engaged state to<br>
the disengaged state (see FIG. 10(a)). Consequently, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac is 0 (see FIG. 10(c)).<br>
Simultaneously, because the gear shifting engine control<br>
section 11L starts the retarding control, the EG torque<br>
TEac is lower than the past values of the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. After that, at the time t2, when<br>
some of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b have been<br>
already moved, the target transmission torque lie performs<br>
the processing to set the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
As described above, in the description herein, the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg that is set at the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin (torque shown by the phantom line<br>
in FIG. 10(b)) is smaller than the correction condition<br>
torque difference ATminl. Thus, the correction processing<br>
section llh performs the processing to set the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value obtained by adding the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATminl to the EG<br>
torque TEac (TEac + ATminl).<br>
After the target transmission torque Ttg is set at<br>
the time t2, engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIGs. 10(a) and 10(b), as the<br>
63<br><br>
clutch 40 is gradually closer to the engaged state, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac gradually approximates the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. Then, at the time t3, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac reaches the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
In this case, as in the case shown in FIGs. 9(a) to<br>
9(d), the actual transmission torque Tac exceeds the EG<br>
torque TEac in the process of its increase to the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (see FIG. 10(c)). Thus, as shown<br>
in FIG. 10(d), the engine speed starts decreasing<br>
gradually from the point in time when the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac exceeds the EG torque TEac.<br>
Thereby, the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
gradually closer to 0.<br>
After that, at the time t4, when the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is smaller than the rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch 40 is<br>
completely engaged, as shown in FIG. 10(a), so that the<br>
half-clutch state is discontinued. Simultaneously, the<br>
gear shifting engine control section 11L ends the<br>
retarding control, and accordingly, the EG torque TEac<br>
increases, as shown in FIG. 10(c). As described above,<br>
the rotational speed difference for discontinuing half-<br>
clutch is preset at 0 or close to 0. At the time t4, the<br>
drive-side member 41 is completely engaged with the<br>
64<br><br>
driven-side member 42, resulting in 0 inertia torque TIac.<br>
In addition, as described above, for calculating the post-<br>
completion transmission torque Tfin, the post-completion<br>
EG torque TEfin, which is calculated by the post-<br>
completion EG torque obtaining section lie, is considered<br>
as torque estimated to be outputted from the engine 30<br>
after completion of the clutch engagement under no<br>
retarding control. Thus, at the time t4, the actual<br>
transmission toque Tac decreases slightly, thereby<br>
corresponding with the post-completion transmission torque<br>
Tfin.<br>
The phantom line in FIG. 10(d) shows an example of<br>
changes in engine speed with respect to time in the case<br>
when no correction processing is performed by the<br>
correction processing section llh. As described above,<br>
the correction processing section llh performs the<br>
processing to set the target transmission torque Ttg at a<br>
value obtained by adding the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATminl to the EG torque TEac. Thus, as shown<br>
in FIG. 10(d), the rate at which the engine speed<br>
decreases is kept higher compared to the case with no<br>
correction processing, and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is thus eliminated earlier.<br>
Now, description is made for the shift-down<br>
operation with reference to FIGs. 11(a) to 11(d). In the<br>
65<br><br>
example herein described, the rotational speed of the<br>
driven-side member 42 is higher than the rotational speed<br>
of the drive-side member 41, and the calculated post-<br>
completion transmission torque Tfin is a sufficiently low<br>
negative value (the difference between the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin and the EG torque TEac is equal<br>
to or greater than the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATmin2).<br>
At the time tl, when the rider turns the shift-down<br>
switch 9b ON, the clutch 40 is switched from the engaged<br>
state to the disengaged state, as in the case shown in<br>
FIGs. 9(a) to 9(d) (see FIG. 11(a)). Consequently, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac is 0 (see FIG. 11(c)).<br>
Then, at the time t2, when some of the shift gears 53a,<br>
53b, 54a, 54b have been already moved, the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is set. As described above, in<br>
this example, the difference between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the post-completion transmission torque Tfin, which is<br>
calculated by the post-completion torque obtaining section<br>
lie, is greater than the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATmin2. Thus, the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is set at the post-completion transmission torque Tfin,<br>
and no correction processing for the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg is therefore performed.<br>
As in the case shown in FIGs. 9(a) to 9(d), after<br>
66<br><br>
the target transmission torque Ttg is set at the time t2,<br>
the clutch actuator 14 is actuated by an amount according<br>
to the difference between the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg and the actual transmission torque Tac. Thus, as<br>
shown in FIGs. 11(a) and 11(b), as the clutch 40 is<br>
gradually closer to the engaged state, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac gradually approximates the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Then, at the time t3, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac reaches the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11(c), the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac is below the EG torque TEac in the process of<br>
its decrease to the target transmission torque Ttg. Thus,<br>
as shown in FIG. 11(d), the engine speed starts increasing<br>
gradually from the point in time when the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac exceeds below the EG torque TEac.<br>
Thereby, the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
gradually closer to 0. As described above, generally, the<br>
output characteristics of the engine 30 show that the EG<br>
torque TEac decreases as the engine speed increases. Thus,<br>
as shown in FIG. 11(c), the EG torque TEac decreases as<br>
the engine speed increases, and the difference between the<br>
EG torque TEac and the actual transmission torque Tac is<br>
gradually reduced.<br>
At the time t4, when the difference between the EG<br>
67<br><br>
torque TEac and the target transmission torque Ttg is<br>
smaller than the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATmin2, the target transmission torque Ttg, which has been<br>
set at the post-completion transmission torque Tfin, is<br>
corrected to a value obtained by subtracting the<br>
correction condition torque difference ATmin2 from the EG<br>
torque TEac (TEac - ATmin2) . Consequently, from the time<br>
t4 onwards, the clutch 40 is gradually closer to the<br>
engaged state such that the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
follows the corrected target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
After that, at the time t5, when the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is smaller than the rotational<br>
speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch<br>
40 is completely engaged, so that the half-clutch state is<br>
discontinued (see FIG. 11(a)). Thereby, the engine speed<br>
stops increasing, resulting in 0 inertia torque TIac.<br>
Therefore, the actual transmission torque Tac increases by<br>
the correction condition torque difference ATmin2 and thus<br>
corresponds with the EG torque TEac. As described above,<br>
the correction condition torque difference ATmin2 is<br>
determined depending on the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference. This allows the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac to increase by a relatively small amount at the time<br>
t5.<br>
Now, with reference to FIGs. 12(a) to 12(d),<br>
68<br><br>
description is made of a case where the rotational speed<br>
of the driven-side member 42 is higher than the rotational<br>
speed of the drive-side member 41, and the difference<br>
between the post-completion transmission torque Tfin and<br>
the EG torque TEac is smaller than the correction<br>
condition torque difference ATmin2.<br>
As in the case shown in FIGs. 11(a) to 11(d), at<br>
the time tl, when the rider presses the shift-down switch<br>
9b down, the clutch 40 is switched from the engaged state<br>
to the disengaged state (see FIG. 12(a)). Consequently,<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac is 0 (see FIG. 12(c)).<br>
After that, at the time t2, when some of the shift gears<br>
53a, 53b, 54a, 54b have been already moved, the target<br>
transmission torque lie performs the processing to set the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. As described above, in<br>
this example, the difference between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the post-completion transmission torque Tfin, which is<br>
calculated by the post-completion torque obtaining section<br>
lie, is smaller than the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATmin2. Thus, the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg, which has been set at the post-completion<br>
transmission torque Tfin by the post-completion torque<br>
obtaining section lie, is corrected to a value obtained by<br>
subtracting the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATmin2 from the EG torque TEac (TEac - ATmin2).<br>
69<br><br>
After the target transmission torque Ttg is set at<br>
the time t2, engaging operation of the clutch 40 starts.<br>
Specifically, as shown in FIGs. 12(a) and 12(b), as a<br>
result that the clutch 40 is closer to the engaged state,<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac approximates the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. Then, at the time t3, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac reaches the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
Also in this case, the engine speed starts<br>
increasing gradually from the point in time when the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac is below the EG torque TEac.<br>
Thereby, the difference in rotational speed between the<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 is<br>
gradually reduced. Generally, the engine output<br>
characteristics show that the EG torque TEac decreases<br>
gradually as the engine speed increases. Thus, as shown<br>
in FIG. 12(b), the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
decreases gradually from the time t2 onwards, and as shown<br>
in FIG. 12 (c), the actual transmission torque Tac follows<br>
this target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
After that, at the time t4, when the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is smaller than the rotational<br>
speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch<br>
40 is completely engaged, as shown in FIG. 12(a). In<br>
addition, as shown in FIGs. 12(c) and 12(d), the engine<br>
70<br><br>
speed stops increasing, resulting in 0 inertia torque TIac,<br>
and therefore, the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
increases by the correction condition torque difference<br>
ATmin2 and thus corresponds with the EG torque TEac. As<br>
described above, the correction condition torque<br>
difference ATmin2 is determined depending on the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference. This allows the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac to increase by a smaller amount at<br>
the time t4.<br>
The phantom line in FIG. 12(d) shows an example of<br>
changes in engine speed with respect to time in the case<br>
when no correction processing is performed by the<br>
correction processing section llh. As described above,<br>
the correction processing section llh performs the<br>
processing to set the target transmission torque Ttg at a<br>
value obtained by subtracting the correction condition<br>
torque difference ATmin2 from the EG torque TEac. Thus,<br>
as shown in FIG. 12(d), the rate at which the engine speed<br>
increases is kept higher compared to the case with no<br>
correction processing, and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is thus eliminated earlier.<br>
In the above-mentioned clutch controller 10, the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch 40 is controlled based<br>
on the difference between the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac, which is transmitted from the drive-side member 41 of<br>
71<br><br>
the clutch 40 to the driven-side member 42 or the<br>
mechanism downstream of the driven-side member 42, and the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg, which is supposed to be<br>
transmitted. This allows an appropriate amount of torque<br>
to be transmitted via the clutch 40. In addition, it is<br>
determined whether or not the difference in rotational<br>
speed between the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 is reduced at an appropriate rate. According to<br>
the determination result, the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg is corrected. This avoids the situation where the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
excessively low rate, and therefore, prevents the clutch<br>
40 from spending too much time on the engaging operation.<br>
Further, in the clutch controller 10, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section 11a calculates the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac based on the EG torque TEac and<br>
the inertia torque TIac produced due to the inertia of the<br>
mechanism (such as the crankshaft 34, the piston 32 and<br>
the primary speed reducing mechanism 36 in the above<br>
description) upstream of the drive-side member 41 in the<br>
torque transmission path. The actual transmission torque<br>
Tac is thus obtained without providing any specific sensor<br>
for outputting a signal according to the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, the<br>
72<br><br>
post-completion torque obtaining section lie, included in<br>
the target torque obtaining section lid, sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at torque estimated to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-<br>
side member 42 or the mechanism downstream of the driven-<br>
side member 42 after completion of the engagement of the<br>
clutch 40 (hereinbefore the torque is referred to as the<br>
post-completion transmission torque Tfin). The correction<br>
processing section llh corrects this target transmission<br>
torque Ttg based on the determination result from the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi. This minimizes<br>
the changes in actual transmission torque Tac at the time<br>
of completely engaging the clutch 40, further improving<br>
riding comfort of the vehicle. In addition, the post-<br>
completion torque obtaining section He sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value small enough to prevent<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference from being reduced<br>
at an excessively low rate.<br>
The clutch controller 10 has the EG torque<br>
obtaining section lib for obtaining the torque outputted<br>
from the engine 30 as engine torque. The target torque<br>
obtaining section lid corrects the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg to increase the difference between the<br>
corrected target transmission torque Ttg and the EG torque<br>
TEac. This prevents the clutch rotational speed<br>
73<br><br>
difference from being reduced at a low rate, which can be<br>
caused due to the reduced difference between the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the EG torque TEac.<br>
Further, according to one aspect of the clutch<br>
controller 10, the appropriateness determining section Hi<br>
determines whether or not the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference is reduced at an appropriate rate based on the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the EG torque TEac. This allows the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg to be corrected before the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is actually reduced at an excessively low<br>
rate, thereby more effectively preventing the clutch 40<br>
from spending too much time on its engaging operation.<br>
According to this aspect, the appropriateness<br>
determining section Hi compares the difference between<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg and the EG torque TEac<br>
with a predetermined value (hereinbefore referred to as<br>
correction condition torque difference ATminl, ATmin2).<br>
Then, according to the comparison result, the<br>
appropriateness determining section Hi determines whether<br>
or not the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced<br>
at an appropriate rate. This avoids the situation, where<br>
the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at an<br>
excessively low rate, by means of the simpler processing<br>
than the processing for calculating the rate at which the<br>
74<br><br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg is reduced.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, the<br>
gear shifting engine control section 11L controls the<br>
engine 30 such that the EG torque TEac decreases during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. This also increases<br>
the difference between the EG torque TEac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, thereby avoiding the situation<br>
where the clutch rotational speed difference is reduced at<br>
an excessively low rate.<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A clutch controller comprising:<br>
an actuator for changing the degree of engagement<br>
between a drive-side member and a driven-side member of a<br>
clutch;<br>
an actual torque obtaining section for obtaining<br>
torque transmitted from the drive-side member to a<br>
downstream mechanism of the torque transmission path as<br>
actual transmission torque, the downstream mechanism<br>
including the driven-side member;<br>
a target torque obtaining section for obtaining<br>
torque that is supposed to be transmitted from the drive-<br>
side member to the downstream mechanism as target<br>
transmission torque; and<br>
a control unit for controlling the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch by actuating the actuator based<br>
on a difference between the actual transmission torque and<br>
the target transmission torque,<br>
wherein the target torque obtaining section<br>
includes a determining section for determining whether or<br>
not a difference in rotational speed between the drive-<br>
side member and the driven-side member is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate, and depending on the determination<br>
result, corrects the target transmission torque.<br>
76<br><br>
2.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 1,<br>
wherein the actual torque obtaining section calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque based on the engine torque and<br>
torque produced due to inertia of a mechanism upstream of<br>
the drive-side member in the torque transmission path.<br>
3.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 1,<br>
wherein the target torque obtaining section sets the<br>
target transmission torque at torque estimated to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member to the downstream<br>
mechanism after completion of engagement of the clutch,<br>
and depending on the determination result from the<br>
determining section, corrects the set target transmission<br>
torque.<br>
4.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 1,<br>
further comprising:<br>
an engine torque obtaining section for obtaining<br>
torque outputted from an engine as engine torque,<br>
wherein the target torque obtaining section<br>
corrects the target transmission torque to increase a<br>
difference between the corrected target transmission<br>
torque and the engine torque.<br>
5.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 4,<br>
77<br><br>
wherein the determining section determines whether or not<br>
the difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate based on the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque and the engine torque.<br>
6.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 4,<br>
wherein the determining section compares the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque and the engine<br>
torque with a predetermined value, and based on the<br>
comparison result, determines whether or not the<br>
difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member is reduced at an<br>
appropriate rate.<br>
7.	The clutch controller as claimed in Claim 1,<br>
further comprising:<br>
an engine control section for controlling the<br>
engine in order to decrease the engine torque during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch.<br>
8.	A straddle-type vehicle comprising the clutch<br>
controller as claimed in Claim 1.<br>
9.	A method for controlling a clutch comprising the<br>
78<br><br>
steps of:<br>
obtaining torque transmitted from a drive-side<br>
member of the clutch to a downstream mechanism in a torque<br>
transmission path as actual transmission torque, the<br>
downstream mechanism including a driven-side member of the<br>
clutch;<br>
obtaining torque that is supposed to be transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member to the downstream mechanism as<br>
target transmission torque;<br>
controlling the degree of engagement of the clutch<br>
by actuating an actuator based on a difference between the<br>
actual transmission torque and the target transmission<br>
torque;<br>
determining whether or not a difference in<br>
rotational speed between the drive-side member and the<br>
driven-side member is reduced at an appropriate rate; and<br>
79<br>
correcting the target transmission torque depending<br>
on the determination result from the determining step.<br><br>
A clutch controller controls the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch by actuating a clutch actuator<br>
based on a difference between actual transmission torque,<br>
which is transmitted from a drive-side member of a clutch<br>
to a driven-side member of the clutch, and target<br>
transmission torque, which is supposed to be transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member to the driven-side member. The<br>
clutch controller also determines whether or not a<br>
difference in rotational speed between the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member of the clutch is reduced<br>
at an appropriate rate, and depending on the determination<br>
result, corrects the target transmission torque.<br></td>
