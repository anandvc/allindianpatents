The present invention relates to a position-reporting device for a movable component, especially for a motor drive of tap selector switches, reversing devices or solenoid coils.<br>
Position-reporting devices as components of motor drives serve for the remote indication of, or provision of information about, the respective actual position of the tap selector switch or the like. They detect this actual position electrically and prepare the obtained data appropriately. These prepared data in turn are the starting point and prerequisite for the actual (remote) position display, which is effected, for example, optically by a lamp panel or a pointer instrument.<br>
Such position-reporting devices are known from the operating instruction "Motor Drive MA7", Impression BA40/90de-0391/2000, of the present applicants. They consist of a reporting contact arrangement, in which a plurality of individual reporting contacts, which are associated with different operational positions of a tap selector switch or the like, are arranged in a circle and are electrically connectible to by a movable wiping contact. In practice, numerous positions are employed for the different cases of application, in particular:<br>
Position-reporting devices for lamp panels are arranged to switch with interruption from one reporting contact to the next. The movable wiping contact and the reporting contacts of the contact track are led out to connecting terminals. Position-reporting devices for remote display by pointer instruments switch from one reporting contact to the next without interruption. For n operational positions, n-1 stage resistors are incorporated between the reporting contacts. The beginning and the end of the contact track as well as the movable wiping contact are led out to connecting terminals.<br>
Position-reporting devices with a diode matrix supply a coded prepared signal, for example in BCD code or Gray code.<br>
Position-reporting devices for decade lamp panels enable a decade display. Position-reporting devices with opening contact tracks, the contacts of which open in the respective operational settings.<br>
In the past, special, specifically designed position-reporting devices, which are custom-made with additional components tailored to the particular application, are used for each of the above-mentioned cases.  In the variant for remote display by a pointer instrument, for<br><br>
example a cross-coil instrument, the required individual resistors are provided directly between the individual reporting contacts which are wiped over by the wiping contact.<br>
These known position-reporting devices specific different use have several disadvantages. On the one hand, production and inventorising of different devices equipped with different components and in different configurations are laborious and expensive. On the other hand, it is not possible to flexibly adapt the devices to changing requirements, which can, for example, result from the mode of representation by the position display having to be changed in a short space of time, such as a previous lamp panel having to be replaced by a pointer arrangement with a cross-coil instrument.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to provide a position-reporting device which is capable of being completed in the manner of a kit so as to permit selectable realisation of diverse possibilities of processing of position data for a rotary component and thereby the remote display or form of representation of this data in simple manner.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a position-reporting device for, for example, a motor drive of tap selector switches, reversing devices or solenoid coils, the device comprising two separate assemblies, namely a contact unit and a physically separate processing module, wherein the two assemblies can be electrically connected together in such a manner that the data obtained in the contact unit are transmissible to the module, wherein the unit comprises a plurality of fixed reporting contacts which are associated with different positions of the component and which are connectible with, for example, a load output line directly or by way of an interconnected quick-action switch by means of a rotatable electrically conductive contact bridge, and wherein the module comprises means for processing data communicated from the contact unit.<br>
Thus, the position-reporting device comprises two spatially separate assemblies which are electrically connected one with the other and are, in particular, a reporting contact arrangement for obtaining data about the respective operational position of the component, for example motor drive, and a processing module for processing the data according to a desired form of display of the operational position of the component. A particular advantage of this arrangement is the universal execution of the entire contact unit arrangement so that it no longer has to be tailored to specific cases of application. Due to the spatial separation of the contact unit for obtaining the data on the one hand and<br><br>
an easily exchangeable module for data processing on the other hand, a simple adaptation to all industrial conditions is possible solely through exchanging the module.<br>
A further advantage is that the arrangement of components, such as resistors (for pointer display), diodes (for coded data) or relays (for make-and-brake contact rows), which are needed for the processing, at the contact unit becomes superfluous. This is a significant difference by comparison with the state of the art. The contact unit can thereby be manufactured in a simpler and technologically more favourable manner and the production of the afore-mentioned components in separate processing modules is similarly more favourable, as is also the exchange of individual components which may have become defective in operation.<br>
It is particularly advantageous that the easily exchangeable module can, at the same time, serve as a transfer point for electrical connecting lines leading to a remote display.<br>
Preferably, the electrical connection between the contact unit and the module is effected by means of plug connectors and an interconnected electrical connecting line with corresponding plugs in such a manner that a first plug connector at the contact unit is electrically connected with the fixed reporting contacts and the load output line and that the second plug connector at the module is connected with the processing means.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the electrical components in the separate module are arranged in such a manner that opposite senses of movement of the component can be accommodated by simple rotation of plug connectors through 180° and replacing them, so that the position signals are issued in reverse order.<br>
The processing means can comprise an electrical circuit operable to process data into a position report by means of a lamp panel, a pointer instrument, a diode matrix according to a code, for example a BCD code or Gray code, decade lamp panels or make-and-break contact rows. Alternatively, the processing means can comprise a universal bridge matrix for processing the data for a position report by electrically conductive bridges which can be individually brought into operative position.<br>
For preference, the microswitch can be selectably bridged over electrically by a bridge in such a manner that a non-bridging switching-over between two neighbouring reporting<br><br>
contacts takes place when the microswitch is switched into a current circuit leading to the load output line and a bridging switching-over between two neighbouring reporting contacts takes place when the microswitch is bridged over.<br>
Expediently, the module is provided with further electrical terminal means which are electrically connected with the processing means and in turn are electrically connectible with remote display means, such as a lamp panel, an indicating instrument or the like.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be more particularly described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

Fig. 10	is a front view of the processing module in said fifth embodiment; and<br>
Fig. 11	is a schematic overall view of a position-reporting device embodying the<br>
invention.<br>
Referring now to the drawings there is shown in Fig. 1 a contact unit of a position-reporting device, the unit comprising a mounting plate 1, which in turn has circularly arranged individual reporting contacts 11 insulated from each other. It also has a continuous output contact ring 12 on a circle concentric with the circle of reporting contacts 11. A microswitch 3, which comprises an actuating lever 31, is arranged on the plate 1 externally of the contact tracks. The unit also comprises a cam disc 2, which is rotatably mounted on the plate 1 by way of a bearing 21, which is provided in the centre of the concentric contact tracks of reporting contacts 11 and output contact ring 12. Drive is effected by a shaft 4. The periphery of the cam disc 2 has a cam profile 22, which co-operates with the actuating lever 31 of the microswitch 3. On the side facing the plate 1, a conductive contact bridge 23, which at one end contacts the reporting contacts 11 individually and at the other end constantly wipes the contact ring 12, is arranged on the cam disc 2. The contact bridge 23 is plugged into openings 24. With this arrangement, different individual reporting contacts 11 can be electrically connected one after the other with the contact ring 12 on rotation of the disc 2. At the same time, the microswitch 3, which is connected into an electrical circuit, is actuated by the cam profile 22. This occurs in such a manner that the microswitch 3 opens the current circuit on each occasion before the contact bridge 23 completely leaves the previous reporting contact 11 during a rotational movement and closes the circuit again after the bridge 23 has reached a new reporting contact. Thus, an interrupting switching-over is provided. Such an arrangement is subject of German Patent Application 197 05 576, which is not prior published.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first plug connector 5 of the contact unit, the connector having 40 pins which are electrically connected with the reporting contact 11, and the current circuit formed by the take-off contact ring 12 and microswitch 3. The microswitch 3 can be bridged by means of an electrically conductive bridge 32, i.e. can be made ineffective. The microswitch 3 provides, as described above, interrupting switching-over. If a bridging switching-over is desired in particular cases of application, for example for the control of a<br><br>
particular form of display instrument, then the microswitch 3 can be made ineffective in simple manner by the bridge 32 without the contact unit itself having to be changed in its mode of construction.<br>
Figure 3 shows a table of correspondence of the wiring arrangement illustrated in Fig. 2. The total possible operational settings 1 to 36 of a motor drive, which positions are associated with respective reporting contacts 11, are illustrated in the upper line. The corresponding pins 1 to 40 of the plug connector 5, which are electrically connected with these contacts 11, are illustrated in the lower line. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the pins 19 to 22 are not electrically connected with specific reporting contacts, but with the current circuit formed by the contact ring 12 and the microswitch 3.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a wiring diagram for a first form of processing or position-reporting module in the device, in which processing of the electrical data communicated by way of the plug connector 5 is carried out spatially separately from the contact unit. In this module there is provided a simple closing contact arrangement in which a corresponding output signal, which leads for example to a separate indicator lamp, is associated with each individual operational position of the motor drive. The pins 1 to 40 of the plug 5 are thus connected to lamp terminals 1 to 36.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a wiring diagram for a second form of module with an opening contact row. The pins 1 to 40 of the plug 5 re connected by relays or contacts Kl to K3 with terminals 3 to 39<br>
Fig. 6 in turn shows a wiring diagram for a third form of module with a diode matrix. BCD-coded information is produced by way of the respective operational setting and made available at the transfer points illustrated at the left. The pins 1 to 40 of the plug 5 are connected to diodes V1 to V216 in the matrix.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a wiring diagram of a fourth form of module, which is here constructed in such a manner as a resistor arrangement that data suitable for the drive control of a cross-coil instrument is produced at transfer points 1, 2 and 3 illustrated at the bottom. The pins 1 to 40 of the plug 5 are connected to resistors R1 to R36 associated with terminals A1 to A37 and B1 to B37. In this variant, in which a continuously indicating display element is driven, a bridging wiring of the reporting contacts 11 is required.    Consequently, the<br><br>
licroswitch 3 would have to be bridged over by the bridge 32 and thereby made ineffective in its function.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a wiring diagram of a fifth module, which is constructed as a universal module. In this case no fixed wiring is provided in the interior, but electrical contact points are connectible together as desired by contact bridges, i.e. so-called jumpers. Such a universal arrangement, as illustrated here, is suitable for a maximum of 35 positions, but, when constructed as a closing contact row, for maximum of only 19 positions. The pins 1 to 40 of the plug 5 are thus associated with terminals A1 to A37, B1 to B37 and C1 to C37.<br>
From the five different wiring diagrams, illustrated by way of example in Figs. 4 to 8, of processing modules in each case to be arranged as an independent assembly separate from an identically constructed reporting contact unit, it is clear that an adaptation to different requirements can be realised in simple manner by the chosen arrangement of just the module. In that case, only an appropriate processing module has to be provided for each display arrangement and the remaining parts of the device remain unchanged. It is also possible to change the function subsequently in simple manner by exchanging the module so as to adapt the device to changed display requirements.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a processing module 6, the wiring diagram of which is illustrated in Fig. 7 and explained further above. The module has a further plug connector 61, which is electrically connected with individual resistors 63. Fastening means 62 are provided at the module and output terminals 64 are arranged at the underside. The numeral 65 designates notations corresponding with the notations illustrated in the lower region of Fig. 7 and lead to an indicating instrument.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a module 7, the wiring diagram of which is illustrated in Fig. 8, namely the universal form of construction. The module comprises a further plug connector 71, which is electrically connected in the interior with the circuit explained above. Output terminals 73, the notations 74 of which correspond with the notation of output points at the bottom of the diagram shown in Fig. 8, are again provided at the underside. A respective matrix for data processing is freely selectable for the module 7 by contact bridges able to be plugged on subsequently.<br><br>
Fig. 11 shows the entire position-reporting device. The reporting contact unit 1, which includes the first plug connector 5 with the terminals electrically associated as described above, is situated in the upper part. Arranged spatially remote therefrom is the processing module, for example the described module 6 or 7, which is illustrated in Fig. 9 or 10 and has a plug connector 61 or 71. The connection between these two assemblies is produced by an electrical connecting line 8, which has, at the two ends, strip plugs 81 and 82, which respectively correspond with the pins of the plug connector 5 on the one hand and the plug connector 61 or 71 on the other hand. In place of the mentioned module 6 or 7, also any desired other such module with a different data processing mode can be connected. Thus, as already explained, a simple adaptation of the entire device to each form of display, one of which is indicated in Fig. 11, is possible in simple manner without change in the region of the contact unit 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
