				<td>This Invention relates to a biocompatible sponge and to a composition used for the production of said sponge,,<br>
During  surgical procedures, vast quantities of inexpensive  high swelling material are   required to absorb blood and fluids from an ope r a t i on  s i t e »  Co 11 on sw ab s or o th e r   c e 1 1 ulosic  m ate r i al  ar e generally  preferred for this purpose» In opthalmic siurgery      and with  particular  reference to cataract  surgery,  high  swelling sponges are      required to absorb the blood and  fluids from      the operation  site  in  short period of less  than  2  minutes.  The sponges  empjlcjyed for such applications should be non toxic,  non       irratatlng,  lint free, sterile and non leach out any  piarticuiar-        matter. Sptonges are preferred as thin pointed strips to get  good        access to the delicate inner regions of the eye area. The sponges       also  should remain     intract and not  fray  or  fracture  during surg i. c a 1 man i pu 1 at i ons.<br>
It is known tc-&gt; use cotton buds, but which is attended with the disadvantages that such buds leave behind fibres in the operated area which is undesi rssb 1 e .<br>
It is also known to use non woven cellulose sponges. As irrever¬sible sweeling reduction or hornification resulting from drying of cellulose is well known, this could lead to fraying of the sponge on being manipulated freely and extensively by the BurQeon „ Other- d i s ad v an t ages of c e 11 u 1 osi c mat er i a 1 i s th at the cellulose can be of any origin

The PVA il^onge is biocompatible and has foeen used as s surgical implant. Varying rts'sult's with this material have been reported, when used as s patch graft or for valve repair. The material has been reported to chan indicate extensive reac¬tion of the sponge in the short term consisting of acute inflsm--mation, and in the long term mature fibrouss tissue with a variable amount of caic H" ication, However, Cobey 
Accordingly, a primary object of this invention is to propose a biocompatible spcsnge 'for absorbing tissue fluids and which obviates the disadvantages associated with those of the prior art „<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a biocompatible sponge for absorbing tissue fluids which is inexpensive, highly absorbing and non to&gt;:i*--«<br>
Still  another object of this invention is to propose  a  biocom	<br>
pstible sponge for absorbing tissue fluids, said sponge capable cj f b e i n g s t e r i 1 i s e d .<br><br>
Yet another- object of this invention is to propose a taiocom-patitale sponge for absorbing tissue fluids which does not fray or leave any lint in the operst ion site.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a composition for the prepa?-ation of s biocompatible sponge.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a process for the production of s biocompatible sponge for abscjrbing tissue fluids.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided s polymeric compo¬sition for producing a bioco0&gt;patibl e sponge for absjorbing tiE&gt;sue fluids comprising s polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol crosslinked by an aldehyde in acidic conditions* in presence of a plastlcizer and sur f ac t an t»<br>
Further according to this invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a biocompatible sponge comprising in the steps of s<br>
i, mixing an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution with a surfactant t o f o rm a d i sp e r s i on 5<br>
ii,  crcjssl ink ing said dispersion in an acidic medium  containing an a 1d ehyde   to f o rm a p o1yme r i c c ompos i t i on; iii. curing said composition to form a sponge.<br>
In accordance with this invention, an aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution is first intimately mixed with an aqueous surfactant B.nd t h e n c r o s s 1 i n k e d i n a h i g h 1 y acidic (n e d i u m.<br><br>
The resultincj dispersion comprises of a highly acidic aqueous solution of polyvinyl alcohol, intimately mixed with a surfsctant, When an aldehyde crosslinking agent is introduced into the dispersion, prefersbly as an aqueous solution at suffi--ciently large quantities, the crosslinking agent is presented initially to the external surface of the foam bubbles, thereby cresting a relatively higher crosslinking density at the surface of the bubbles than in the interior. This causes the bubbles to be crosslinked without considerable collapse and leads to the formation of s sponge or foam with uniformly small pores. Any suitable aldehyde capable of being dispersed in aqueouss polyvinyl alcohol solution capable of formincj the sponge is employed. Suitable aldehydes ar-B by way of example formaldehyde, a c e t a 1 d e h y d e , b u t y r^ a 1 d e h y d e g 1 u t a r a 1 d e h y d e , e t c , .<br>
Further other macromol ecul es;. may be incorporated into the p&gt;oly-" vinyl alcohol solution, even if they do not participate in the cross!inking reaction. These may be added to the polyvinyl alcohol in the aqueous phase, in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50*^ by weight, or more and become entrapped during the cross--linking process. Such added macromolecules include, for example polyethylene glycol, cartaoxymethyl dextran, carboxymethy1-cellulose, cellulose, starch, dextran, glycerol.<br>
The polyvinyl alcohol solution may be prepared by adding poly¬vinyl alcohol to water, stirring continuously to avoid the formation of lumps. The polyvinyl alcohol to be used is prefe¬rably of the fully hydrolysed grades, and can be of any molecular<br>
weight  in the range 10,000 to 2,50,000. The temperature  of  the<br>
o aqueous phase can be any temperature from 25 C„<br><br>
The polyvinyl alcohol solution produced is generally s viscous solution. The concentration of the polyvinyl alcohol varies between 5 to 2.0% depending on the molecular weight of the F'VA used to produce the desired viscosity.<br>
The surfactants are next added and should be capable of forming froth in a highly acidic media. Typical of such surfactants are sodium 1 aurylsulphate, tween, etc. and mixtures thereof, Ccjncen-tr-ation of the surfactant varies from 2% to 20% by weight. The acids used ss catalysts should preferably be strong acids capable of forming highly acidic media without undue dilution of the viscosity of the media. Examples of such acids are sulfuric acid, h y d roc h 1 o r i c a c i d a n d m i &gt;; t u r e s t h e r e o f uj i t h a c on c e n t r a t i on of 10 to 30% by volume.<br>
The invention further includes s method for producing a foam or sponge. The method comprising first preparing the sponge by crosslinking the polyvinyl alcohol in acidic media using the suitable concentrations of the aldehyde in pcjlyethyl ene molds of suitable sizes. The sponge is cleaned in war-m tap water and methanol. The sponge is then dried and cut into desired shapess which may be parallelograms or spear shape or any other shape for medical applications. The cut sponges are then cleaned with distilled water using an Ultrasonicator till no particulate matter is observed in the extracted water when observed through a microscope. The sponge is then squeezed dry and allowed to swell in 2 to 20f4 aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol cjr other glycols with molecular weights ranging from 400 to 1000 until equilibrium  absor^ption is attained. The swollen sponges  may  be<br><br>
'dried at room tefnperature and used SB such, although more absorp¬tion may be obtained by dring in compressed conditions. Further  objecrbs  and advantages of this invention will  be  more apparent  from  the ensuing examples, which are not  intended  to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1<br>
