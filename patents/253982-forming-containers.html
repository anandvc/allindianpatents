Forming containers<br>
The invention relates to forming containers from a semifinished product, for example in plastic material such as a pad formed by injection, or a disc or a dose of plastic material in a paste state.<br>
The state of the art comprises systems for thermoforming containers from flat film in single-layered or multilayered plastic matter.<br>
US 2854694 discloses a method for forming hollow articles or containers from materials in plastic condition, such as hot thermoplastic material or other material in sheet form. The material in sheet form and in a plastic condition is positioned over a female mold which may be of hollow cylindrical form and is gripped between the mold and a hold down element. The material is then pressed between a plunger and a bottom plate and also pressed at the same time between the body mold and the hold down member in a manner to thicken and increase the volume of the plastic material surrounding the plunger, thus accumulating sufficient material for forming side walls of adequate thickness. This accumulated material is stretched downward to form side walls by downward movement of the male die or plunger and the bottom plunger relative to the hollow mold.<br>
US 4159977 discloses a tubular plastic container having a molecularly oriented sidewall portion which is made by bringing the peripheral portion of a solid blank in engagement with the shoulder portion of a die, introducing the blank into a cavity of the die while compressing with a first and second plungers, such that in the former stage of the introduction, the speed is relatively low and the pressure is relatively high, and then the speed is increased at a controlled rate and the pressure is decreased, thereby forming a hollow molded piece, and then expanding the molded piece to bringing the<br><br>
sidewall portion thereof into contact with the inner surface of the cavity.<br>
DE 1479583 discloses a method in which a hollow article is formed from a heated blank, of synthetic plastics material, by clamping the blank about the mouth of a split mould, drawing the blank using co-operating heated plungers and finally expanding the drawn blank into conformity with the mould. During the co-ordinated drawing movement of the plungers, the upper plunger is moved relatively towards the lower plunger to express material from therebetween, which material forms the lower regions of the wall of the finished container and has a high degree of molecular orientation imparted thereto. The final separation of the two plungers determines the ultimate wall and bottom thickness of the finished article.<br><br>
&gt; The	invention	go la tee	to  forming	oontoinero	from^u*<br>
semifinished product, for example in plastic matetiarir^such as a pad formed by injection, or a disc^j^r^Tdose   of plastic<br>
material in a paste state <br>
The state of thg^-al^comprises systems for thermoforming contaijifrpe—from flat film in single-layered or multilayered rr-pXactic aatteri 1 Systems are furthermore known for forming containers that provide for expanding, by means of pressurised air, in a forming mould, a preform of a container obtained by injection. JP - 2001 000362600, publication JP - 2003 159743, is furthermore known that discloses a system for forming containers comprising in sequence:<br>
positioning a semifinished disc-shaped product in plastic material near an opening of a forming mould for forming containers;<br>
expanding said semifinished product in said forming mould by means of a punch inserted into said mould through said opening.' Before being positioned near the opening, the semifinished product is formed in a suitable forming mould for forming the semifinished product, in which a dose of thermoformable plastic material is placed between a punch and a die that can be moved up to and be removed from one another to give the dose the desired shape*<br>
JP -'2001 000362600 therefore has the drawback of using - two types of mould, i.e. a mould for forming the semifinished product and a mould for forming containers.<br>
Furthermore, JP - 2001 000362600 involves subjecting the plastic material to a complete heating and cooling cycle to form the semifinished product and to a further heating and cooling cycle to form the container.<br><br>
US 6,264,050 discloses a forming system in which, starting<br>
from a sheet material, precursors of containers are formed<br>
that are then separated from the sheet material and expanded<br>
in a forming mould by compressed air to obtain formed<br>
containers.<br>
US 6,264f050 has the drawback of using different apparatuses<br>
to form the precursors and to expand the latter to obtain<br>
containers.<br>
An object of the invention is to improve the known systems to<br>
obtain containers.<br>
A further object is to make the manufacturing systems for<br>
blown containers more compact.<br>
A further object is to improve the forming conditions of a<br>
semifinished element positioned near the opening of a forming<br>
mould for forming containers.<br>
In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method<br>
oomprioingi    A£6oAlVirvJG TO CtAm A .<br>
in forming a perform of platio matter expanding said preform to obtain a container; wherein  said  forming  comprises  compression-fjpanfng  said preform in that mould means in which said expatfifing occurs.<br>
In a second aspect of the inventipn-^there is provided a<br>
method comprising:<br>
expanding a pre£p«f* into mould means to obtain a<br>
container ,^-*^*^ wherein b£f<j said expanding there is provided for forming a dosiof plastic material in paste state mould to obtain pro form. fthirrd aspect of the invention an apparatus comprising- t3 cl m.></j>
puncb^-aeens for expanding a preform in said forming<br>
-*—   mould moans;	1<br><br>
abuting Rteaac cooperating with said punoh mong<br>
wherein said punch means and said abutting means identify a configuration in which said punch means ajaeb-^said abutting means cooperate to define a comgpfrffSion-forming unit for compression-forming a senii^ifiished product in plastic material to obtains^id^preform, and a further configuration in which sa^d^ptinch means and said abutting means cooperate to <j an expansion unit of said preform to obtain a></j>
«^oontaino3Fi—\ Owing to these aspects of the invention, it is possible, to form containers from semifinished products located in a single forming mould* In fact, the semifinished product to be formed i s placed at the opening of the mould means, i s then shaped to obtain a preform and this preform is then expanded without the preform having to be extracted from the mould means, as on the other hand occurs in known forming systems.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to obtain better control of forming through the effect of the shaping of said semifinished product and the presence of abutting means that acts on the semifinished product together with the punch means on an opposite side of the latter. Furthermore, a particularly compact forming system it is<br>
. obtained. Furthermore, the plastic material is subjected to a single heating cycle that comprises a progressive heating and cooling in several phases.<br>
In particular, the invention enables containers to be obtained starting from a semifinished product in plastic material that may comprise an element with a thin thickness, for example a disc obtained by shearing from a film, or an injected body, or a dose of plastic material in a paste state.<br><br>
In all the aforementioned cases, obtaining a preform by<br>
compression-forming from the semifinished product, enables<br>
the subsequent obtaining the container by blow-forming to be<br>
improved.<br>
The preliminary step of obtaining  a preform having  a<br>
prefixed  geometry,  for  example  walls  having  different<br>
thickness in various points of the preforms, enables in fact<br>
a different heating phase of the preform prior to the<br>
expansion phase of the latter to be avoided.<br>
The advantage of being able to create  a preform and<br>
subsequently expand it appears particularly clear in the<br>
case of the element with a thin thickness and of the dose of<br>
plastic material in a paste state, that both could not be<br>
subjected to  an expansion phase without previously be<br>
conformed as a preform.<br>
In the case of the injected body, it is a question of an<br>
element that is structurally more similar to a preform.<br>
Nevertheless, also in this case the compression-forming of a<br>
preform  from  the  injected  body  brings  significant<br>
advantages.<br>
Obtaining a preform in two phases  (i.e.  injection- and<br>
subsequent compression-moulding)  in fact enables plastic<br>
material to be used having a high molecular weight, which is<br>
very appreciated in order to facilitate operations of<br>
stretch-blow-forming.<br>
Any defects in the injected body due, for example, to the<br>
low viscosity that is typical of plastic material with high<br>
molecular weight,  can be subsequently eliminated in the<br>
compression-moulding phase,  enabling containers that are<br>
free of defects to be obtained.<br>
In particular,  it is possible to use injection moulds<br>
provided with an injection opening (gate) of considerable<br>
dimensions, in order to facilitate the flow of the plastic<br>
matter.<br><br>
The discontinuity created in the injected body by the orientation of the injection opening is subsequently eliminated during the subsequent phase of compression-forming.<br>
The possibility of using plastic material with a high molecular weight and of obtaining preforms substantially free  of  defects  and  having  walls  with  a  controlled thickness, enables the preforms to be subjected to blowing that acts both axially and radially, in the same mould. The invention may be better understood and implemented with reference  to  the  enclosed  drawings  that  show  some embodiments by way of non-limitative example, in which: Figure 1 is a longitudinal section of a forming apparatus, in an initial phase in which a semifinished product is supplied to a mould;<br>

Figure 17 is a diagram that shows a further heating cycle to<br>
which the plastic material can be subjected in a forming<br>

With reference to Figure 1, a mould 2 is shown for forming a<br>
container 4 (see Figure 6), comprising a base plate 6 on<br>
which there is fixed an external casing 10 of a die 8 that<br>
is internally provided with a cavity- Within the casing 10<br>
there is fixed a liner 12 that defines an intermediate part<br>
14 of the cavity 9 and carries at its opposite ends a first<br>
member 16 and a second member 18, which respectively define<br>
a first end zone 20 and a second end zone 22 of the cavity<br>
9.<br><br>
The first member 16 has an opening 24 and defines a seat 26 in which can be received a semifinished product 50 from which the container 4 is formed.<br>
The second member 18 receives within itself a base part 30 in an axially sliding manner as will be explained in greater detail below.<br>
The base plate 6 has a pair of bushes 32 in which respective guide rods 34 are slidingly fitted, the respective ends of which are connected by a first crosspiece 36 and by a second crosspiece 38.<br>
The second crosspiece 38 and the first crosspiece 36 are on opposite sides of the die 8, the second crosspiece 38 supporting a punch 4 0 turned towards the die 8. The punch 4 0 and the base part 30 are movable inside the die 8 independently of one another, in such a way as to identify a first configuration, in which the punch 40 and the base part 30 cooperate to define a forming unit for compression-forming the semifinished product 50 to obtain a preform 51, and a second configuration, in which the punch 40 and the base part 30 cooperate to define an expansion unit for the expansion of the preform 51 to obtain the container 4. In particular, in the first configuration, the punch 40 and the base part 30 are arranged near the opening 24. In the first configuration the base part 30 cooperates with the die 8 to define a chamber inside which the punch 4 0 can penetrate to press the plastic material against wall means delimiting said chamber.<br>
Subsequently, after the preform 51 has been formed, the base part 30 and the punch 40 are removed from the opening 24 to identify the second configuration, in which the base part 30 cooperates with the die 8 to define a further chamber inside which the punch 40 expands the preform 51 to obtain the container 4.<br><br>
The punch 40 comprises a punch body 42 inside which is<br>
axially slideable a stem 44 passing through a hole 45 of the<br>
second crosspiece 38 and having a shaped head 46 turned<br>
towards the die 8.<br>
The head 4 6 is housed in a chamber 4 8 provided in the punch<br>
body 42 into which an operating fluid, for example air at<br>
controlled pressure, can be introduced and from which it can<br>
be extracted.<br>
In the position in Figure 1, a disc shaped semifinished<br>
product 50 is positioned in the seat 26 at the opening 24.<br>
The semifinished product 50 is obtained by shearing from a<br>
single-layer or multilayered film.<br>
The first crosspiece 36 is kept fixed and the base plate 6<br>
is made to slide on the pair of rods 34 in the direction<br>
indicated by the arrow F to bring the first crosspiece 36 up<br>
to the punch 40, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
In this way, the top surface 52 of the die 8 approaches an<br>
annular front surface 56 of the punch 40 in such a way that<br>
an axial and central projection 54 of the latter penetrates<br>
inside the seat 2 6 and interacts with the surface of the<br>
semifinished product 50 turned towards it.<br>
Once the projection 54  is in. the interaction position<br>
disclosed above, the base part 30 is taken by an actuator 60<br>
in the direction indicated by the arrow Fl through the<br>
cavity 9 to the opening 24 in such a way as to interact with<br>
a further surface of the semifinished product 50 opposite<br>
the surface that is in contact with the shaped head 46.<br>
In this interaction position, temperature control means (not<br>
shown) intervenes on the semifinished product 50 in such a<br>
way as to take it to the thermoforming temperature whereas<br>
the semifinished product 50 is shaped by the combined action<br>
of the shaped head 46 and the base part 30.<br><br>
Alternatively, the semifinished product 50 can be positioned<br>
in seat 26 when it is already at the temperature at which<br>
compression-forming occurs.<br>
Subsequently, now with reference to Figure 3, whilst the<br>
base plate 6 is kept in the position disclosed in Figure 2,<br>
the base part 30 is returned by the actuator 60 to its<br>
initial position in a direction F2 opposite direction Fl.<br>
Furthermore, the stem 4 4 shifts the shaped head 4 6 to the<br>
base part 30, stopping before reaching it. In this way, the<br>
semifinished product 50 has a peripheral part tightened<br>
between the projection 54 and the seat 26 and a central part<br>
that is drawn by the shaped head 4 6 to form a precursor 58<br>
of a container.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, compressed air is introduced<br>
into the chamber 4 8 that occupies the precursor 58 of a<br>
container and expands the precursor 58 until it reaches the<br>
walls that define the cavity 9.<br>
This is made possible by the fact that the stem 44 has a<br>
transverse dimension that is smaller than that of the shaped<br>
head 4 6 and therefore when the shaped head 4 6 is outside the<br>
chamber 4 8, the air that is introduced into the chamber 4 8<br>
can exit by the side of the head 46.<br>
With reference to Figure 5, it is shown how, in order to<br>
extract the shaped container 4, it is necessary to open the<br>
die 8 by separating the casing and liner parts and the<br>
inserts that make it up.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the container 4 has a flange 62<br>
radially protruding from a neck 64 that leads away from a<br>
converging wall part 66 that is joined to a central wall<br>
part 68.<br>
A base 70 has a peripheral support edge 12   that converge<br>
into a divergent wall 74 connected to the central wall part<br>
68.<br><br>
In Figure 7 the temperature levels are shown in a forming cycle of the container 4 in the apparatus 1 of Figures 1 to 5.<br>
During a first phase, the semifinished product 50 is heated to temperature Ti, advantageously coinciding with the plasticization temperature of the plastic matter, i.e. the temperature at which compression-forming of the preform occurs. After a set period of time in which the semifinished product 50 is maintained at the temperature Ti, the semifinished product is cooled to the temperature T2, advantageously coinciding with the forming temperature, i.e. the temperature at which stretch-blow-forming of the container occurs.<br>
At temperature T2 the preform is expanded to create a container. The container is kept at temperature T2 for a certain period of time and is then progressively cooled to temperature T3/ coinciding for example with ambient temperature.<br>
In the diagram in Figure 8, in which the typical temperature levels of a system for forming containers according to the state of the art are shown, for example JP - 2001 000362600, it is noted how after bringing the material to temperature Ti i.e. to plasticization temperature, to obtain a preform in a first mould for forming preforms, the preform has to be cooled to temperature T3, for example to ambient temperature, and be subsequently heated in a second mould for forming the containers.<br>
As shown with reference to Figure 9, in the seat 26 there is inserted, instead of the disc 50, a semifinished product 53 injection-formed before it is inserted into the seat 26 in a suitable mould that is not shown. The semifinished product 53 has a substantially circular shape with a central depression, but more in general, it may have any suitable shape, according to necessity, to obtain a preform 51 shown<br><br>
in Figure 2, and it acts as a preliminary preform to obtain<br>
the preform 51.<br>
Figure 10 shows a variation in which instead of a disc 50,<br>
or of a preliminary preform 53, the semifinished product to<br>
be positioned near the opening 24 comprises a dose 55 of<br>
extruded  plastic material  in  a  paste  state.  In  this<br>
embodiment, unlike what has been described with reference to<br>
Figures 1 to 9, the base part 30 is in a position near the<br>
opening 24 in such a way as to substantially occupy it,<br>
preventing the dose from falling into the cavity 9 in an<br>
uncontrolled manner. The dose 55 is thus released on the<br>
base part 30, when the latter is in the position shown in<br>
Figure 10 waiting to cooperate with the punch 40 to give<br>
rise to the preform 51.<br>
In this embodiment, the dose of plastic matter, when it is<br>
positioned  on  the  base  part  30,  is  already  at  the<br>
temperature at which compression-forming of the preform 51<br>
occurs.<br>
For this purpose,  the dose of plastic material can be<br>
extruded and subsequently cooled inside the extruder to the<br>
temperature at which compression-forming occurs.<br>
Alternatively,  two  serially  arranged  extruders  can  be<br>
provided.<br>
The apparatus embodiments in Figures 9 and 10 operate, in<br>
terms of forming of the preform 51, and the subsequent<br>
forming of the container 4,  as already disclosed with<br>
reference to Figures 2 to 5.<br>
With reference to Figure 17, the -temperature levels in a<br>
forming cycle of the container 4 are shown, the latters<br>
being different from the ones of the forming 'cycle in Figure<br>
7.<br>
Initially, a semifinished product, such as a flat element,<br>
or an injected body, or a dose of plastic material in a<br>
paste  state,  is  introduced  into  the  mould  2,  this<br><br>
semifinished product having been previously heated to a<br>
temperature  Ti,  at  which  temperature  the  semifinished<br>
product is compression-formed to create a preform 51.<br>
Subsequently,  the  semifinished  product  is  kept  at  a<br>
temperature TV , at least during the compression- forming<br>
phase.<br>
Thereafter, the perform 51 thereby obtained is expanded to<br>
create a container 4.<br>
Expansion of the preform occurs at a temperature T2' that is<br>
lower than the temperature Ti', the difference between the<br>
temperature TV  and T2'  being rather limited.  In other<br>
words, the temperature Ti' and T2' are near to each other.<br>
In a  further heating cycle,  which  is  not  shown,  the<br>
temperature  at  which  expansion  of  the  preform  occurs<br>
substantially coincides with the temperature at which the<br>
preform was compression-formed.<br>
A small or possibly non-existent difference between the<br>
temperature at which expansion of the preform occurs and the<br>
temperature at which the preform was compression-formed<br>
enables a more uniform distribution of the temperature to be<br>
obtained in the thickness ' of the preform, and therefore<br>
enables stretch-blow-forming to be optimised.<br>
The  container  obtained  is  subsequently  cooled  to  a<br>
temperature T3' .<br>
As shown in Figure 11, a forming apparatus similar to the<br>
one disclosed with reference to Figures 1 to 10 can also be<br>
fitted onto a rotating machine.<br>
In the particular case in which forming of the container<br>
occurs starting from a dose 55 of plastic material in a<br>
paste state, it is provided for that the dose is conveyed<br>
above the opening 24 occupied by the base part 30 by a<br>
turntable 100 that is made to rotate around an axis B<br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis A. In a peripheral zone of<br>
the turntable 100 spoons 101 are supported by a side of the<br><br>
table, which spoons 101 pick up a dose 55 from an outlet 102 of an extruder 103 and deposit it on the base part 30 in a raised position.<br>
The base part 30 is a component of the cavity 8 fitted to a bottom part 104 of a carousel 105 that is rotatable around a main axis C of the machine. The bottom part 104 can thus be provided with a plurality of cavities distributed along its periphery. The carousel 105 is provided with a top part 10 6 fitted with a corresponding plurality of punches superimposed on the cavities 8.<br>
On the turntable 100 a star 107 is fitted that is provided with arms 108 between which gaps 109 are defined between which the formed containers 4 are received singly that are released by the respective punches 40.<br>
The containers 4 are picked up by the punches 40 by means of the star 107 and are transferred by the arms 108 to an unloading zone S whilst they rest on the turntable 100. In one version, that is not shown, a plurality of apparatuses 1 can be provided that are fitted to form a set of pressing units arranged in line.<br>
From the comparison between Figures 12 and 13, it is possible to provide that the base part 30 can be positioned at variable distances from the top of the cavity 8. In this way, it is possible to use the same cavity 8 to obtain different formats of containers 4, 4' by simply arranging the base part 30 at different distances from the top of the cavity 8. In particular, it is shown how the different arrangement of the base part can provide containers that differ from one another by a preset height H. In such cases, it is preferable for the intermediate part 14 to have a cylindrical form with constant cross-section that extends at least for a portion that occupies the possible different positions that the base part 30 can take up.<br><br>
The head 4 6 and/or the base part 30 may be made of several parts arranged concentrically in relation to one another, in such a way as to make possible to form preforms 51, or containers 4, having the most widely varying geometries. For this purpose, the parts that form the head 4 6 and/or the base part 30 are slideable in relation to one another and can be independently powered.<br>
With reference to Figure 14, it is shown how the base part 30 may comprise a central portion 80 surrounded by a peripheral portion 82 that may slide axially along a longitudinal axis A of the mould 2 in relation to the central portion 80. In this way, the central portion 80 can for example be positioned either in such a way that its internal surface 84 is substantially coplanar with an internal peripheral surface 86 of the peripheral portion 82 to form a substantially flat container base.<br>
Alternatively, as shown by the broken line, the internal surface 84 can be shifted further to the inside of the cavity 9 in such a way as to form a container base that has a central zone 70a that is raised in relation to the peripheral edge 72.<br>
With reference to Figure 15, it is shown how the shaped head 46 comprises an external annular part 200 and an internal annular part 202, both of which are driven independently in a direction W parallel to the axis A. In this way it is possible to move the internal part 202 and the external part 200, as well as the central portion 80 and the peripheral portion 82, in such a way as to enable a preform 51 to be obtained as shown in Figure 2. In particular, the central portion 80 faces the internal part 202 and substantially has a transverse dimension that is larger than that of the latter. In this way it is possible, as shown in Figure 16, for the internal part 202 to penetrate inside the peripheral<br><br>
portion 82 in such a way as to give rise to a central projection 206 in a preform 204.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
