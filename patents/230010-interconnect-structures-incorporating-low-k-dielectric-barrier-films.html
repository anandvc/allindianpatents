INTERCONNECT STRUCTURES INCORPORATING LOW-K<br>
DIELECTRIC BARRIER FILMS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	The present invention claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent<br>
application 60/443,504 filed January 29, 2003 the whole contents and disclosure of which is incorporated by reference as is fully set forth herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to the utilization of dielectric layers that<br>
have low dielectric constants (k
More particularly, it relates to the use of the dielectric barrier layers in metal<br>
interconnect structures, which are part of integrated circuits and microelectronic<br>
devices. The primary advantage that is provided by this invention is the reduction in<br>
the capacitance between conducting metal features, e.g., copper lines, that results in<br>
an enhancement in overall chip performance.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0003]	Materials which function as diffusion barriers to metal, may be<br>
incorporated in metal interconnect structures that are a part of integrated circuits. Diffusion barriers to metal are typically required to generate reliable devices, since low-k interlayer dielectrics typically do not prohibit metal diffusion.   The placement of metal diffusion barrier materials in interconnect structures may differ and often is dependent upon the properties of the metal diffusion barrier and the means in which they are processed. Barrier layers comprised of metal and dielectrics are commonly utilized in interconnect structures.<br>
[0004]	Diffusion barrier layers, comprised of metal include, but are not<br>
limited to: tantalum, tungsten, ruthenium, tantalum nitride, titanium nitride, TiSiN, etc. Diffusion barrier layers often serve as liners, whereby they form a conformal interface with metal conducting structures. Normally, these materials are deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition<br><br>
(PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering, thermal evaporation, and other related approaches. To utilize these materials as barrier layers, the metal barrier layers must be conformal to conducting metal lines and cannot be placed as blanket layers that would serve as conducting pathways.<br>
[0005]	There are numerous approaches in which this can be accomplished.<br>
One limiting criteria for these barrier layers is that their contribution to the resistivity of conducting metal lines must not be excessively high; otherwise, the increase in the total resistance of the metal conducting structures would result in reduced performance.<br>
[0006]	Diffusion barrier layers comprised of dielectrics including, but not<br>
limited to: silicon nitrides, silicon carbides, and silicon carbonitrides, are also utilized in microelectronic devices. These materials are normally deposited by chemical vapor deposition (C VD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) approaches and can be deposited as continuous films. Unlike diffusion barrier layers comprised of metal, the dielectric layers can be deposited as blanket films and can be placed between conducting metal lines. In doing so, these dielectric layers contribute to the capacitance between metal lines. A limiting constraint of these systems is their relatively high dielectric constants (k=4.5 through 7.0) that result in a substantial increase in the effective dielectric constant between metal lines leading to reduced device performance. Decreasing the film thickness of these barrier layers can also lead to reductions in the effective dielectric constant "k"; however, insufficiently thick layers may not be reliable and nevertheless may still make a significant negative contribution to the dielectric constant. Another disadvantage of these systems is the cost and complexity associated with the tools and processes involved in their deposition.<br>
[0007]	Barrier layer films that are generated by spin-coating dielectrics, or<br>
other solvent based approaches, having an appropriate copper binding moiety to prohibit copper diffusion, have also been proposed. These systems are based on the addition of the copper binding moiety as an additive and have several potential<br><br>
drawbacks. Due to the lack of covalent bonding of the moiety to the dielectric matrix, the moiety may be expelled from the matrix by diffusion processes, solvent extraction, and thermolysis, resulting in a loss of the copper barrier properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]	This invention relates to interconnect structures having a ceramic<br>
diffusion barrier layer with a low dielectric constant (e.g. k
[0009]	The interconnect structure may be comprised of at least one<br>
conducting metal feature, formed on the substrate, with the substrate further comprising at least one insulating layer surrounding the conducting metal feature. The insulating layer may surround at least one conducting metal feature at its bottom, top, and lateral surfaces. The structure may further comprise at least one conductive barrier layer formed on at least one interface between the insulating layer and the conducting metal feature. The combination of the conducting metal feature and the insulating layers, may be repeated to form a multilevel interconnect stack.<br>
[0010]	The interconnect structure may be one of a silicon wafer containing<br>
microelectronic devices, a ceramic chip carrier, an organic chip carrier, a glass substrate, a gallium arsenide wafer, silicon carbide wafer, a gallium wafer, or other semiconductor wafer.<br><br>
[0011]	In the first embodiment of this invention, an interconnect structure<br>
having the ceramic diffusion barrier layer is described. In broad terms the inventive interconnect structure includes:<br>
at least one conducting metal feature formed atop a substrate;<br>
at least one interlayer dielectric layer surrounding at least one metal feature; and<br>
a ceramic diffusion barrier formed between at least one interlayer dielectric layer and at least one conducting metal feature, said ceramic diffusion barrier having a composition SivNwCxOyHz, where 0.1 
[0012]	In a first example of the first embodiment, a preceramic polymeric<br>
precursor is applied by a solvent based approach (e.g., spin-coating) to generate the ceramic diffusion barrier layer, also referred to as a cap barrier layer film. The remaining interconnect structure may be comprised of a via level dielectric, a line level dielectric, hardmask layers, and buried etch stop layers.<br>
[0013]	In a second example of the first embodiment, the preceramic<br>
polymeric precursor is applied in the same manner as above to generate a cap barrier layer film and is used simultaneously as a low-k cap barrier layer and a via level dielectric. This approach produces an interconnect structure having a hybrid interlayer dielectric, where the line level dielectric layers may be any dielectric and the via level dielectric and ceramic diffusion barrier layer are combined into one layer.<br>
[0014]	In a third example of the first embodiment, the preceramic polymeric<br>
precursor is applied in the same manner as above to generate a ceramic diffusion barrier layer and is used simultaneously as a low-k ceramic diffusion barrier layer, a via level interlayer dielectric, and a line level interlayer dielectric. This approach produces an interconnect structure having an interlayer dielectric where both the via and line level dielectric layers are combined with the ceramic diffusion barrier layer to form a continuous interlayer dielectric layer.<br><br>
[0015]	In a fourth example of the first embodiment, the preceramic<br>
polymeric precursor is applied in the same manner as above to generate a ceramic diffusion barrier layer onto an interconnect structure having a interlayer dielectric comprised of at least two dielectrics, where the dielectric underneath the metal lines chemically differs from the dielectric in other regions.<br>
[0016]	The ceramic diffusion barrier layer has a low dielectric constant of<br>
less than about 3.3, preferably less then about 2.8, and even more preferably about 2.6. The ceramic diffusion barrier layer also prohibits metal diffusion (preferably copper), and is thermally stable to temperatures of about 300°C. The ceramic diffusion barrier layer may also contain porosity that further reduces the dielectric constant "k" to less than about 2.6, most preferably about 1.6. The pores may be generated by a removal of a sacrificial moiety that may be polymeric. The pores may also be generated by a process that involves the elimination of a high boiling point solvent. The pores may have a size scale of about 0.5 nm to about 20 nm and may have a closed cell morphology.<br>
[0017]	In a second embodiment of this invention, a method to produce the<br>
ceramic dif&amp;sion barrier layer is described. In broad terms the inventive method includes the steps of:<br>
applying a coating of a polymeric preceramic precursor onto a substrate having at least one metal region and at least one insulating region, where the polymeric preceramic precursor has a composition of SivNwCxOyHz, where 0.1 
converting the polymeric preceramic precursor into a ceramic diffiision barrier layer, where the ceramic diffusion barrier prohibits the diffusion of metal.<br><br>
[0018]	The polymeric preceramic precursor, utilized in the second<br>
embodiment, may also have the composition SivNwCxOyHz, where 0.1<v></v>
0<w and v></w>
[0019]	More specifically, a polymeric preceramic precursor is first dissolved<br>
in a suitable solvent and then spin coated onto a interconnect structure, having metal and dielectric material exposed at it's uppermost surface, to form a ceramic diffusion barrier layer. The ceramic diffusion barrier layer may be annealed at elevated temperatures, e.g., from about 200°C to about 400°C, to eliminate residual solvent and to crosslink the material. Conventional processing may follow the formation of the ceramic diffusion barrier layer to produce interconnect structures having a low-k barrier layer film and separating metal lines from interlayer dielectric layers.<br>
[0020]	Upon coating, the polymeric preceramic precursor film is converted<br>
to a ceramic diffusion barrier layer through the use of one or a combination of any suitable process including: thermal curing, electron irradiation, ion irradiation, irradiation with ultraviolet and/or visible light, etc. During this process, the polymeric preceramic precursor may crosslink into a rigid, insoluble matrix to form the ceramic diffusion barrier layer. The resultant ceramic diffusion barrier layer may have a dielectric constant less than about 3.3, be thermally stable, have low leakage currents, have a high breakdown field value, and prohibits the diffusion of metal (preferably copper). For systems generated from silicon containing polymeric preceramic precursors, the ceramic diffusion barrier layer may have a composition of SivNwCxOyHz, where 0.1 <v z for v the ceramic diffusion barrier layer may also have a composition of sivnwcxoyhz where></v>
[0021]	In a third embodiment of this invention, compositions for producing a<br>
ceramic diffusion barrier layer are described. The polymeric preceramic precursor is a molecule that is used to form a ceramic diffusion barrier layer that has a low dielectric constant (k
 <br>
chain architecture (including linear, networked, branched, dendrimeric) and can contain one or more monomelic units in any sequential arrangement (random, alternating, block, tapered, etc.). The polymeric preceramic precursor can also be a physical mixture of two or more polymeric components.<br>
[0022]	The polymeric preceramic precursor may be selected from systems<br>
having silicon as part of the backbone structure including: polysilazanes, polycarbosilanes, polysilasilazanes, polysilanes, polysilacarbosilanes, polysiloxazanes, polycarbosilazanes, and polysilacarbosilazanes. The polymeric preceramic precursor may have pendant functional groups bonded to the chain backbone including, but not limited to: hydrido, vinyl, allyl, alkoxy, and alkyl groups. The polymeric preceramic precursor may also be comprised of a system having a carbon backbone and pendant functional groups comprised of at least Si and N, and may also have C, O, and H. An example of such a material is poly(silylcarbodiimides). In general, these silicon containing polymeric preceramic precursors may lead to a ceramic diffusion barrier layer having a composition of SivNwCxOyHz, where 0.1

suitable process known in the art prior to the deposition of the polymeric preceramic precursor. The cleaning may be a wet clean involving exposures to acids, bases and organic solvents. The cleaning may also involve any dry etch process known in the art.<br>
[0030]	The polymeric preceramic precursor film is then converted to a<br>
ceramic diffusion barrier layer through the use of one or a combination of any suitable process including, but not limited to: thermal curing, electron irradiation,<br><br>
ion irradiation, irradiation with ultraviolet and/or visible light. Thermal anneals may be performed at temperatures in excess of about 400°C and may be performed in an inert atmosphere.

The line level dielectric 31 may contain a hardmask dielectric 41 that differs in composition from the remainder of the line level dielectric 31.<br>
[0032]	The interconnect structure can be generated by a number of<br>
sequential processing steps including the use of lithography, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), reactive ion etching, thermal annealing, wet chemical cleans, film deposition by solvent based coating, film deposition by chemical vapor deposition, and combinations thereof.<br>

preceramic precursor that is applied onto the interconnect structure by any solvent based coating schemes including, but not limited to: spin coating, scan coating, dip coating, spray coating and combinations thereof. The polymeric preceramic<br><br>
precursor is then converted into the ceramic diffusion barrier layer 36 through the use of one or a combination of any suitable processes including: thermal curing, electron irradiation, ion irradiation, irradiation with ultraviolet and/or visible light, etc. During this process, the polymeric preceramic precursor may crosslink into a rigid, insoluble matrix.

ceramic diffusion barrier layer through the use of one or a combination of any suitable process including: thermal curing, electron irradiation, ion irradiation, irradiation with ultraviolet and/or visible light, etc. In the case of thermal annealing, the anneals may be performed at temperatures in excess of about 400°C and under inert atmospheres including, nitrogen, forming gas, and argon. During this process, the polymeric preceramic precursor may crosslink into a rigid, insoluble matrix. If the optional codissolved adhesion promoter is used, the adhesion promoter may segregate to film interfaces during this conversion process. In optional step 7, adhesion promoters may be applied to top surface of the ceramic diffusion barrier layer. Preferred adhesion promoters include those mentioned above.<br>
[0049]	The solution containing the polymeric preceramic precursor may also<br>
contain moieties that produce porosity, including sacrificial polymeric materials that degrades into low molecular weight byproducts and/or high boiling point solvents<br><br>
that are expelled from the film during the conversion of the polymeric preceramic precursor into the ceramic diffusion barrier layer. The sacrificial polymeric material may be selected from the group consisting of: poly(stryenes), poly(esters), poly(methacrylates), poly(acrylates), poly(glycols), poly(amides), and poly(norbornenes).<br>
[0050]	The ceramic diffusion barrier layer preferably has a dielectric<br>
constant less than 3.3, is thermally stable, has low leakage currents, has high breakdown field values, and prohibits the diffusion of metal (preferably copper) through the film. Referring to Figures 4(a) and 4(b), suitable breakdown characteristics and leakage current characteristics are demonstrated for a film generated from a polysilazane preceramic precursor, as low percentages of breakdowns are observed for fields less than 7 MV/cm (Figure 4(a)) and the leakage currents are less than 10"7 amps/cm2 at both room temperature and 150 °C (Figure 4(b)).<br>
