The following will explain the production of isoxazoline derivatives (described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 308857/2002) using the inventive compounds represented by the general formula [ I ] as intermediates, and herbicidal action of the isoxazoline derivatives.<br>
First, there will be explained the production of the isoxazoline derivatives (described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 308857/2002) using the inventive compounds represented by the general formula [I].<br><br><br><br>
group or R11 and R12 are combined together with the carbon atom bonded thereto to form a C3 to C7 spiro ring, and further R9, R10, R11, and R12 may form a 5 to 8-membered ring together with the carbon atom bonded thereto. R13 represents a CI to C4 alkyl group, a phenyl group which may be substituted, or a benzyl group which may be substituted and L represents a leaving group such as a halogen atom, a CI to C4 alkylsulfonyl group, a phenylsulfonyl group which may be substituted, or a benzylsulfonyl group which may be substituted.<br>
The following will explain each step of the above processes for producing isoxazoline derivatives. (Step 11)<br>
A sulfide derivative represented by the general formula [23] can be produced by reacting a compound represented by the general formula [20] with sodium hydrosulfide hydrate represented by the general formula [21] in a solvent or in the absence of solvent (preferably in a suitable solvent) in the presence of a base to produce a salt of a mercaptan represented by the general formula [22] in the reaction system and then reacting the salt of the mercaptan [22] , which was not isolated, with the halogen derivative represented by the general formula [10] which is an inventive compound (optionally, the reaction is conducted under an inert gas atmosphere or a reducing agent can be added). (Step 12)<br>
A sulfoxide derivative represented by the general<br><br>
formula [25] can be produced by reacting a sulfide derivative represented by the general formula [23] with an oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent. (Step 13)<br>
A sulfone derivative represented by the general formula [26] can be produced by reacting a sulfoxide derivative represented by the general formula [25] with an oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent. (Step 14)<br>
The sulfone derivative represented by the general formula [26] can be produced by reacting the sulfide derivative represented by the general formula [23] with a suitable amount of an oxidizing agent in a suitable solvent without isolating the sulfoxide derivative represented by the general formula [25] . (Step 15)<br>
The sulfide derivative represented by the general formula [23] can be produced by reacting a compound represented by the general formula [24] with the mercaptan derivative represented by the general formula [13] which is an inventive compound in a solvent or in the absence of solvent (preferably in a suitable solvent) in the presence of a base (optionally, the reaction is conducted under an inert gas atmosphere or a reducing agent can be added) . The mercaptan derivative represented by the general formula [13] which is an inventive compound can be also produced in the reaction system by the method described in Step 6 or 7<br><br>
of Production Process 5 and then employed.<br>

The following will explain herbicidal action exhibited by the compound represented by the general formula [26] (the isoxazoline derivative described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 308857/2002), which is producible by using the pyrazole derivative represented by the general formula [I] or salt thereof (inventive compound).<br>
In using the compound represented by the general formula [26] (the isoxazoline derivative described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 308857/2002) as a herbicide, the compound may be used by itself but can be also used as formulated in the form of a dust, a wettable powder, an emul-<br><br>
sifiable concentrate, a flowable, a microgranule, a granule, or the like by mixing with a carrier, a surfactant, a dispersing agent, an auxiliary agent, or the like which are commonly used for formulation.<br>
Examples of the carrier to be used for the formu-lation include solid carriers such as talc, bentonite, clay, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, white carbon, vermiculite, calcium carbonate, slaked lime, silica sand, ammonium sulfate, and urea; liquid carriers such as isopropyl alcohol, xylene, cyclohexane, and methylnaphthalene; and the like.<br>
Examples of the surfactant and the dispersing agent include metal salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids, metal salts of dinaphthylmethanedisulfonic acid, salts of alcohol sulfate esters, alkylarylsulfonic acid salts, lign-insulfonic acid salts, polyoxyethylene glycol ether, poly-oxyethylene alkyl aryl ethers, monoalkylates of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, and the like. Examples of the auxiliary agent include carboxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol, gum arabic, and the like. At the use, it is diluted to an appropriate concentration and then sprayed or applied directly.<br>
The compound represented by the general formula [26] can be used by foliar sparying, soil application, water surface application, or the like. The amount of the active ingredient to be blended is suitably determined according to the necessity. When a powder or a granule is prepared, the amount may be suitably determined in the<br><br>
range of 0.01 to 10% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5% by weight. When an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder is prepared, the amount may be suitably determined in the range of 1 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 30% by weight. When a flowable is prepared, the amount may be suitably determined in the range of 1 to 40% by weight, preferably 5 to 30% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compound represented by the general formula [26] as a herbicide to be applied varies depending upon the kind of the compound used, the target weed, the tendency of weed emergence, the environmental conditions, the form to be used, and the like. When the compound is used per se as in the case of a powder or a granule, the amount is suitably determined in the range of 1 g to 50 kg, preferably 10 g to 10 kg per 1 hectare in terms of the active ingredient. When the compound is used in a liquid form as in the case of an emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable powder, or a flowable, the amount is suitably determined in the range of 0.1 to 50,000 ppm, preferably 10 to 10,000 ppm.<br>
The compound represented by the general formula [26] may be mixed as necessary with an insecticide, a fungicide, other herbicide, a plant growth-regulating agent, a fertilizer, and the like.<br>
The following will explain the formulation method specifically with reference to typical Formulation Examples. The kinds of compounds and additives and their blending ra-<br><br>
tios are not restricted thereto and can be varied in a wide range.   In the following description, "parts" refers to parts by weight. <reference formulation example> Wettable powder<br>
To 10 parts of the compound represented by the general formula [26] were mixed and pulverized 0.5 part of polyoxyethyleneoctyl phenyl ether, 0.5 part of a sodium salt of P-naphthalenesulfonic acid formalin condensate, 20 parts of diatomaceous earth, and 69 parts of clay, whereby a wettable powder was obtained. <reference formulation example> Flowable<br>
Into 69 parts of water was dispersed 20 parts of a coarsely pulverized compound represented by the general formula [26]. Four parts of a sulfate of a polyoxyethylene styrenated phenyl ether, 7 parts of ethylene glycol were added thereto, and 200 ppm of Silicone AF-118N (manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation) was added relative to the formulated product. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes in a high-speed stirrer and then pulverized in a wet pulverizer to obtain a flowable. <reference formulation example> Emulsifiable concentrate<br>
To 30 parts of the compound represented by the general formula [26] were added 60 parts of an equal volume mixture of xylene and isophorone and 10 parts of a mixture of surfactants, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan alkylate, a polyoxyethylenealkyl aryl polymer, and an alkyl arylsul-fonate.  The resulting mixture was thoroughly stirred to<br><br>
obtain an emulsifiable concentrate. <reference formulation example> Granule<br>
Ten parts of water was added to 10 parts of the compound represented by the general formula [26], 80 parts of an extender where talc and bentonite were mixed in a ra-tio of 1:3, 5 parts of white carbon, and 5 parts of a mixture of surafactants, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan alkylate, a polyoxyethylene alkylaryl polymer, and an alkyl arylsul-fonate. The resulting mixture was thoroughly kneaded to form a paste. The paste was extruded through sieve eyes having a diameter of 0.7 mm. The extrudate was dried and then cut into a length of 0.5 to 1 mm to obtain a granule.<br>
The following will explain effects of the compound represented by the general formula [26] with reference to Test Examples.<br><reference test example> Test for herbicidal effect by paddy field soil treatment<br>
A paddy field soil was filled in a plastic pot of 100 cm2 and subjected to puddling. Then, seeds of Echi-nochloa oryzicola Vasing and Monochoria vaginalis var. plantaginea were sowed and water was filled in a depth of 3 cm. Next day, each wettable powder produced in accordance with Formulation Example 1 were diluted with water and dropped on the water surface. The application amount of the wettable powder was 250 g or 1,000 g per 1 hectare in terms of the active ingredient. Then, breeding was made in a greenhouse, and the herbicidal effect of the wettable<br><br>
powder was examined at the 21st day after the treatment in accordance with the standards shown in Table 13. The results are shown in Table 14.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
