				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This irivention relates to saline soluble fibres used as refractory insulation and further relates to saline soluble, non-metallic amorphous, inorganic oxide, refractory fibrous materials.<br>
Inorganic fibrous materials are well known and widely used for many purposes (e.g. as thermal or acoustic insulation in bulk, mat, or blanket form, as vacuum-formed shapes, as vacuum formed boards and papers, and as ropes, yarns or textiles; as a reinforcing fibre for building materials; as a constituent of brake blocks for vehicles). In most of these applications the properties for which inorganic fibrous materials are used require resistance to heat, and often resistance to aggressive chemical environments.<br>
Inorganic fibrous materials can be either glassy or crystalline. Asbestos is an inorganic fibrous material one form of which has been strongly implicated in respiratory disease.<br>
It is still not clear what the causative mechanism   is that relates some asbestos, with disease but some researchers believe that the mechanism is mechanical and size related.   Asbestos of a critical size can pierce cells in the body and so, through long and   repeated   cell injury, have a bad effect on health.<br>
Whether this mechanism is tine or not regulatory agencies, have indicated a desire to categorise any inorganic fibre product that has a respiratory fraction as 'hazardous' regardless of whether there is any evidence to support such categorisation. Unfortunately for many of the applications toi which inorganic fibres are used, I here are no realistic substitutes.<br>
Accordingly there is a demand for inorganic fibres that will pose as little risk as possible (if any) and for which there are objective grounds to believe them safe.<br>
A line of study has proposed that if inorganic fibres were made that were sufficiently soluble in physiological fluids that their residence time in the human body was short; then damage would not occur or at least be minimised. AS the risk of asbestos-linked disease appears to depend very much on the length of exposure this idea appears reasonable. Asbestos is extremely insoluble.<br>
As intercellular fluid is saline in nature the importance of fibre solubility in saline solution has long been recognised. If fibres are soluble in physiological saline solution then, provided the dissolved components are not toxic, the fibres should be safer than fibres which are not so soluble. The shorter the time a fibre is resident in the body the less damage it can do. H. Forster in "The behaviour of mineral fibres in physiological solutions' (Proceedings of 1982 WHO I ARC Conference, Copenhagen, Volume 2, pages 2.7-55(1988)) discussed the behaviour of commercially produced mineral fibres in physiologicaJ saline solutions. Fibres of widely varying solubility were discussed.<br><br>
International Patent Application No. WO87/05007( Indian pat Nos.166538 and 169752) disclosed<br>
that fibres comprising magnesia, silica, calcia and less than 10 wt% alumina are soluble in saline solution. The solubilities of the fibres disclosed were in terms of parts per million of silicon (extracted from the silica-containing material of the fibre) present in a saline solution after 5 hours of exposure. The highest value revealed in the examples had a silicon level of 67 ppm. In contrast, and adjusted to the same regime of measurement, the highest level disclosed in the Forster paper was equivalent to approximately 1 ppm. Conversely if the highest value revealed in the International Patent Application was converted to the same measurement<br>
regime as the Forster paper it would have an extraction rate of 901,500 mq Si/kg fibre - i.e. some 69 times higher than any of the fibres Forster tested, and the fibres that had the highest extraction rate in the Forster test were glass fibres which had high alkali contents and so would have a low melting point. This is convincingly better performance even taking into account factors such as differences in test solutions and duration of experiment.<br>
International Patent Application No. WO89/12032 disclosed additional fibres soluble in saline solution and discusses some of the constituents that may be present in such fibres.<br>
European Patent Application No. 0399320 disclosed glass fibres having a high physiological solubility.<br>
Further patent specifications disclosing selection of fibres for their saline solubility are European 0412878 and 0459897, French 2662687 and 2662688, PCT W086/04807 and WO90/02713 .<br>
The refractoriness of the fibres disclosed in these various prior art documents varies considerable. The maximum service temperature of any of these disclosed fibres (when useci as refractory insulation) is up to 815°C (1500°F).<br>
Service temperature for refractory insulation is definable in many ways but to be consistent with the above mentioned International Patent Applications this application shall mean by service temperature that temperature at which the fibre shows acceptable shrinkage (maximum of 5% linear shrinkage after exposure to temperature for 24 hours) and at which the fibre has not appreciably suffered through excessive sintering or softening.<br>
There is a demand for physiologically soluble fibres having a service temperature of greater than 815 oC,<br>
particularly for such fibres having a service temperature above 900*C.<br>
Testing for physiological solubility and safety can be done by inhalation studies on, e.g. rats. However such studies are extremely time consuming and costly. A study can take of the order of 2 ½ years from start and can easily cost fl million per study. A cheaper alternative is to test for solubility in physiological or like fluids in vitro.<br>
Testing of an inorganic fibre for solubility in physiological solutions is not so time consuming, but there is currently no way of predicting which systems will produce such soluble fibres. Therefore anyone seeking to find such soluble fibres has to work on a trial and error basis assisted by what is commonly known as "chemical intuition' but is egually commonly known as 'a hunch'. Such trial and error testing is laborious and time consuming. Further, once a fibre is found that is soluble there is no guarantee that it will be usable at useful service temperatures.<br>
Accordingly there is a demand for a method of predicting whether a fibre will have a reasonable solubility in physiological solutions, and further there is a demand that such a test should preferably give an indication as to expected service temperature.<br>
Shrinkage of inorganic refractory fibres occurs through two mechanisms; the first is viscous flow of the fibre material. Most inorganic refractory fibres are glasses and so may be defined as liguids having an exceedingly high viscosity (but still liable to flow). By their nature fibres are elongate and so have a high surface area per unit volume. As the reduction of surface area is a means of reducing the surface energy of a material, when the glass becomes fluid enough it will flow so as to reduce surface area. This flow results in a coarsening and shortening of the fibres and so to<br>
shrinkage, and in the extreme results in disruption of the fibres  into  separate particles.<br>
The second mechanism leading to shrinkage is that at elevated temperatures glasses may crystallise to form one or more crystal phases. Usually these crystal phases have a smaller molar volume than the glasses from which they crystallise and so shrinkage results. Some fibres are known for which the molar volume of the crystalline form exceeds that of the glass (for example Al2O3/SiO2 glassy fibres may crystallise to form mullite crystals). In these cases the expansion due to crystallisation may oppose the shrinkage caused by viscous flow.<br>
If shrinkage through viscous flow occurs at a much lower temperature than crystallisation then the crystallisation may not be able to compensate for such shrinkage.<br>
There is a demand for a fibre in which both viscous flow and crystallisation occur at as high and as similar a temperature as possible, and preferably in which the expansion due to crystallisation closely matches the shrinkage due to viscous flow so that the net effect is as close to zero shrinkage as possible.<br>
When used as refractory insulation inorganic refractory fibres are used in several forms. The fibres may be supplied as a bulk material, but in this form the fibres are difficult to handle for many applications. Alternatively the fibre may be supplied as a blanket. Blanket fibre is generally made by a process of sucking fibre from air onto a conveyor to form a blanket. Because the fibres tend to be aligned parallel to the conveyor surface they can separate easily. Accordingly the blanket fibres are secured together by adding a binder to lock the fibres together, or by needling the blanket, or both. Tn noedl i nc7 noodles arc passod through tho thickness of the blanket to push and draw fibres to lie transverse to the<br>
blanket and so tie the fibres together. Because binders are usually resins, such as phenolic resins, they burn off on first firing. There is a desire to reduce the amount of such binders used both because of possible health implications in handling, and because the combustion products may affect the strength of the fibres. Thus needled blanket is usually preferred.<br>
The fibres may also be supplied as blocks, generally made from assembled layers of inorganic fibre blanket.<br>
For some fibres needling is not possible. Crystalline fibres are generally too brittle to stand the stresses involved. For the fibres known in the industry as glass fibres (which are generally used for low temperature applications) the amount of 'shot' (unfiberised glass particles) present is generally too high to allow needling as the shot damages the needles. There is no needled blanket on the market that has a maximum service temperature in the range 900°C-3200°C. There are needled blankets having a higher maximum service temperature but these use expensive fibres in comparison with other fibres usable (with the aid of binders) as blanket in the temperature range 900°C-1200oC.<br>
Accordingly there is a demand for needled fibre blanket<br>
formed from inexpensive materials, being soluble in saline<br>
solutions, and having a maximum service temperature in the<br>
range 900°C-1200°C.<br>
As stated previously refractory oxide fibres are made by several methods all of which involve the formation of a melt of oxides and the subseguent fiberisation of the melt by e.g. spinning or blowing.<br>
The melt of oxide material is often formed by electrical discharge melting of the constituent raw materials. The applicants, in manufacture of a CaO/MgO/SiO2 refractory oxide<br>
fibre encountered problems due to the necessity of handling CaO. These problems were discovered to be due to the moisture content of CaO as commercially available. One of the problems of use of CaO is the outgasing that results upon melting and this led at the least to a porous melt pool which caused fluctuations in the melt current; in the extreme the outgasing was explosive. Additionally use of CaO appeared to cause accelerated attach on the melt electrodes. Also CaO is a difficult and corrosive material to handle.<br>
Accordingly there is a need for a process that minimises the use of CaO.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a synergistic refractory insulation composition having a maximum service temperature in excess of 815°C comprised of saline soluble fibres selected for their property of having a shrinkage of less than 3.5% when exposed to 1000°C for 24 hours and having a shrinkage of less than 3.5% when exposed to 800°C for 24 hours, and comprising vitreous fibres comprising SiO2 and either or both of CaO or MgO and having a composition comprising (in weight %):-<br>
SiO2   more than 58% -(for MgO less than or equal to 10%) and<br>
SiO2   more than 58% + (0.5(%MgO -10) -(for MgO more than or equal to 10%)<br>
CaO	0% - less than 42%<br>
MgO	0%-31.33%<br>
A12O3	0% - less than 3.97%,<br>
wherein the said vitreous fibres optionally comprise Na2O less than<br>
or equal to 0.65%, K2O less than or equal to 0.13%, Fe2O3 less<br>
than or equal to 0.40%, ZrO2     less than or equal to 1.23%, and being essentially free of fluxing components such as alkali metal oxides and boron oxide.<br>
The presently disclosed refractory insulation composition is synergistic composition and it is neither a chemical substance prepared from a chemical process nor a mere admixture of its ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides the following features both independently and in combination:-<br>
A.	'Use of a vitreous inorganic fibre in the knowledge that it has a<br>
composition meeting the criteria either:- that the calculated sum of the<br>
free energies of hydration of the compounds that would or could be<br>
present at equilibrium (on the basis of knowledge, informed belief or<br>
reasonable   assumption)        is        more	negative	than        10<br>
kcal/l00grams (-418.4kJ/kg) of composition; or that the percentage of<br>
non- bridging oxygens is more than 30%.    Such compositions tend to be<br>
saline soluble.<br>
B.	Use of such a vitreous inorganic fibre in the knowledge that it has a<br>
composition meeting the criterion that the ratio of glass modifiers to<br>
network formers is less than a critical value (for SiO2 based compositions<br>
the critical value is 1).    Such compositions tend to be glass formers.<br>
C.	The invention also encompasses fibres selected by adopting such<br>
criteria as a test for solubility and glass formation.<br>
I). Use as saline soluble fibres having a shrinkage of less<br>
than 3.5% when exposed to 1000°C for 24 hours and/or 800 °C for 24 hours, of vitreous fibres having a composition comprising (in weight %):-<br>
Si02     &gt;58%	-	(for MgO ' = 
Si02     &gt;58% + o.5(%MgO -10)   -	(for Mgo &gt;= 10%)<br>
(Si02 preferably being below 70%)<br>
CaO      0% - 42%<br>
MgO      0% - 31.33% A1203     0% - 
and being essentially free of fluxing components such as alkali metals and boron oxide.<br>
J3. In one such usage the first crystalline material resulting on crystallisation has the crystal structure of diopside and has the composition consisting essentially of:-<br>
Coraponent         Composition A<br>
Weight percent<br>
Si02	59-64<br>
A12°3	0-3.5<br>
CaO	19-23<br>
MgO	14-17<br>
li. In a second such usage the first crystalline material resulting on crystallisation has the crystal structure of wollastonite/pseudowollastonite and has the composition consisting essentially of:-<br>
Component	Composition B<br>
Weight percent<br>
SiO2	60-67<br>
A12O3	0-3.5<br>
CaO	26-35<br>
MgO	4-6<br>
G. The fibres used in such manner may further be used as needled blankets.<br>
H. Preferably the fibres of the general composition and compositions A and B mentioned above have a SiO2 content (expressed as a weight percentage of the constituents SiCU, CaO and MgO) of greater than 60%.<br>
I. The present invention further provides a method for the manufacture of refractory oxide fibres containing calcium and silicon by the formation of an oxide melt containing calcium and silicon characterised in that all or part of the calcium and all or part of silicon is provided by a calcium silicate.<br>
The invention is illustrated by way of example in the following description and with reference to the drawings in which:-<br>

A series of fibres were made of the compositions shown in Table l. Those fibros wore spon  by using a vertical spinning system of the type known for making inorganic fibres. Also shown in Table 1 are the compositions of some comparative commercially available inorganic oxide fibres and glass fibres.<br>

[MST   =  Maximum  Service  Temperature   (oxidising   atmosphere)]<br>
The fibres SW-A, SW-A1, SW-A2, SW-B1 , SW-B2 and SW-Hj were tested for solubility by the following method.<br>
The fibre was first chopped in the following manner •. 2.5 g of fibre (deshotted by hand) was liquidised with 250 cm ! of distilled water in a domestic Moulinex (Trade Mark) food blender for 20 seconds. The suspension was then transferred to a. 500 cm plastic beaker and allowed to settle after which as much liquid as possible was decanted and the remaining liquid removed by drying in an oven at 110°C.<br>
The solubility test apparatus comprised a shaking incubator-water bath, and the test solution had the following composition:-<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The above materials were diluted to 1 litre with tiist distiation water to form a physiologica1-1 like saline solution.<br>
0.500 grams ± 0.0003 grams of chopped fibre was weighed into a plastic centrifuge tube and 25 cm of the above saline solution added. The fibre and saline solution was shaken well and inserted into the shaking incubator water bath maintained at body temperature (37°C ± 1°C). The shaker speed was set. it 20 cycles/minute.<br>
After the desired period (usually 5 hours or 24 hours)<br>
the centrifuge tube was removed and centrifuged at ~ 4500 revs/minute for approximately 5 minutes. Supernatant liquid was then drawn off using a syringe and hypodermic needle. The needle was then removed from the syringe, air expelled from the syringe, and the liquid passed through a filter (0.45 micron cellulose nitrate membrane filter paper [WCN type from Whatman Labsales Limited]) into a clean plastic bottle. The liquid was then analysed by atomic absorption using a Thermo Jarrell Ash Smith - Hiefje II machine.<br>
The operating conditions were:-<br>

(Table Removed) The procedure and' standards adopted for determining the above elements were as set out below.<br>
SiO2 can be determined without dilution up to 250 ppm<br>
concentration (1 ppm = 1mg/Litre. Above this concentration an appropriate dilution was made volumetrica1ly. A 0.1% KC1 solution (O.lg in 100 cm ) was added to the final dilution to prevent ionic interference. NB If glass apparatus is used, prompt analysis is necessary.<br>
From a stock solution of 1000 ppm pure ignited silica (99.999%) (fused with Na2CO3 at 1200°C for 20 minutes in a platinum crucible (0.2500g SiO2/2g Na2CO3) and dissolved in<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid  (4 molar) made up to 250cm  with distilled water in a plastic volumetric flask) the following<br>
standards were produced:-<br><br>
STANDARD (PPM SiO2)<br>

5.0 10.0 25.0<br><br>
Add 0.1% KC1 to each standard before making to l00cm3.<br>
Aluminium may be measured directly from the sample without dilution. Standards of 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 ppm Al may be used. For calibration readings are multiplied by 1.8895 to convert from Al to A12O3.<br>
A standard Al atomic absorption solution (e.g. BDH 1000 ppm Al) was bought and diluted using an accurate pipette to the desired concentration. 0.1% KC1 was added to prevent ionic interference.<br>
Calcium may require dilutions on the sample before determination can be carried out (i.e. x 10 and x 20 dilutions). Dilutions must contain 0.1% KC1.<br>
A standard Ca atomic absorption solution (e.g. BDH 1000 ppm Ca) was diluted with distilled water and an accurate pipette to give standards of 0.5, 4.0 and 10.0 ppm. 0.1% KC1 is added to prevent ionic interference. To convert readings obtained from Ca to CaO a factor of 1.4 was used.<br>
Magnesium may require dilutions on the sample before determinations can be made (i.e. x 10 and x 20). Add 0.1% KC1 to each dilution. To convert Mg to MgO multiply by 1.658.,<br>
A .standard Mg atomic absorption solution (e.g. BDH 10 ppm Mg) was diluted 'with distilled water and un accurate<br>
pipette  to give standards of 0.5,  1.0 and 10.0 ppm Mg 0.1% KC1 was added to prevent ionic interference.<br>
All stock solutions were stored in plastic bottles. The results of the tests are indicated in Table 2.<br>

BODY FLUIDS SOLUBILITY <br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Fibres with the best solubility (SW-A2 and SW-B3) were then tested, after annealing at varying temperatures, and compared with the comparative examples of Table 1. The results are shown in Table 3.<br>
It can be seen that for the SW-A2 fibre, with increasing annealing temperature, the silica solubility drops progressively. In contrast the SW-B3 composition shows no loss in solubility up to 800°C and although a reduction in solubility is shown above that temperature it is not as dramatic as for SW-A2. Despite this difference in solubility it is to be noted that only the needled GF fibre shows a<br>
comparable silica solubility and that material melts at 700°c<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
[The Glass Fibre and Needled Glass Fibre had the compositions shown in Table 1.]<br>
The_ user is primarily concerned with the solubility of the fibre as received as it is in this condition that most handling occurs; as received both SW-A2 and SW-B3 fibres have extremely high solubility. Even after exposure to 800°C and 1000°C these fibres have solubilities much higher than other high temperature use fibres.<br>
To investigate the reasons underlying the difference in solubilities after high temperature annealing between the SW-A2 and SW-B3 fibres qualitative X-ray diffraction was done on the fibres. The results are indicated in Table 4 and it can be seen that the SW-B3 fibre forms pseudowollastonite and wollastonite, whereas the SW-A2 fibre forms diopside. It appears therefore that the crystalline diopside has a lower solubility in physiological saline solution than the crystalline pseudowollastonite and wollastonite material precipitated from the SW-B3 fibre.<br>
TABLE 4<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Various of the fibres were then tested for their shrinkage characteristics.    Table 5 shows the results of Shrinkage tests on all the test fibres and on some of the comparative fibres.   These results were obtained by proposed ISO standard ISO/TC33/SC2/N220 (equivalent to British Standard<br>
BS 1920, part 6,1986) with some modifications to account for small sample size. The method in summary comprises the manufacture of vacuum cast preforms, using 75g of fibre in 500cm3 of 0.2% starch solution, into a 120 x 65mm tool. Platinum pins (approx 0.1-0.3mm diameter) were placed 100 x 45mm apart in the 4 corners. The longest lengths (LI &amp; L2) and the diagonals (L3 &amp;L4) were measured to an accuracy of tO.Olmm using a travelling microscope attached to a steel rule with a vernier scale. The samples were placed in a furnace at temperature and left for 24 hours. The shrinkage values are given as an average of the 4 measurements.<br>
TABLE 5<br>
LINEAR SHRINKAGE (Table Removed)<br>
It can be seen that in SW-A, SW-A1, SW-A2, SW-B1, SW-B2 and  SW-B3,  owing  to  the  increase  in  molar  volume  on crystallisation, the linear shrinkage at the maximum service temperature is less than 3.5%.<br>
Table 6  shows the results of shrinkage tests made in the same way.<br>
further series ofTABLE 6<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
To ascertain the applicability of these tests to long term usage a series of cyclic shrinkage tests were undertaken on the materials and the heating schedule used for these cyclic<br>
tests is shown in Figure 3.<br>
The results of the tests are shown in Tables 7 &amp; 8 (the two figures given for SW-B3 are due to slight differences in chemical analysis [the fibre at the end of a production run of fibre tends to have slightly differing composition to that at the beginning of a production run of fibre]).<br>
As a further comparison with the above discussed materials a melt was made comprising 55% SiO2, 29.9% CaO and<br><br>
18.6% MgO.   Fibres made using this composition had a maximum service temperature of 700°C and melted at 800°C.<br>
As these results were encouraging the applicants conducted a further and extensive series of tests, concentrating on the SW-A2 and SW-B3 compositions, to ascertain the reproducibility of these results and the boundaries of the useful compositions.<br>
Table 9 (two pages) below gives the compositions of a series of melts, ranked on silica content, and showing the shrinkage figure after exposure to 1000°C for 24 hours (1st column) and 800°C for 24 hours (2nd column). These shrinkages were .measured by the same method as the shrinkages given above but measurements were made with a travelling microscope with a digital linear scale accurate to ± 5µm. It can clearly be seen that all fibres with a silica content of less than 58% have a shrinkage at 1000°C of greater than 3.5% save two (B3-3 and 708). These fibres, together with some fibres with a silica content of greater than 58% although showing a reasonable figure at 1000°C, show a very poor figure at 800°C.<br>

The clearest anomaly is Fibre 932 as this fibre, with an SiO2 content of 59.85%, has a shrinkage of 12.8%. On the assumption that the minimum silica level for satisfactory shrinkage varies with MgO content the applicants have determined that fibres with a silica content (in weight percent) %hat fails to meet the following expression do not have satisfactory shrinkages at either or both 800°C and 1000°C:-<br>
Si02O &gt; 0.18684*MgO + 56.926 %<br>
It can be seen that sample 924 (which has a rationalised composition of 64.1% Si02) has a shrinkage of 3.0% at 800°C. This is higher than its neighbouring compositions (the closest being 757 and A2-9) can possibly be explained by the alumina content of 2.5%. The applicants have found that with increasing alumina levels the first material to crystallise is calcium aluminate and this possibly forms a liquid phase that assists flow and hence shrinkage.<br>
Table 10 shows, for the same compositions as Table 9, 24 hour solubilities for each major constituent. It can be seen that all of the compositions have high solubilities.<br>
As mentioned above use of CaO in forming calcium containing fibres is inconvenient and can be hazardous. The applicants investigated use of mixed oxide materials that would avoid the handling of CaO. A fibre was made by admixture of magnesia with silica and wollastonite (CaSiO3).<br>

Hepworth Mineral's Redhill T washed silica sand SiO2     -   99.0% min.<br>
These constituents were mixed as 78.65% Wollastonite; 19.25% SiO2; and 3.6% MgO. This gave 0.4 - 0.5% of the final melt as A12O3.<br>
It was surprisingly found that in producing a melt using these constituents the current requirements were only two-thirds that for the use of the raw oxides.<br>
Fibre was produced by blowing (although spinning and other methods can be used) . 2 runs were performed with different blowing conditions.<br>
Chemical analysis was undertaken by the Analytical Department at the applicant's subsidiary Morgan Materials Technology (hereinafter called M2T) using wet chemical techniques. Fibre diameters were measured using M2T's Galai particle analyser, with shape analysis software. Typically 40,000 fibres were analysed for each run.<br>
The first result of note was the speed of melt reaction when using wollastonite as compared with lime. Also the current was seen to be very stable throughout the growth of the melt. If the current was lost whilst pulling the electrodes apart the current could be restored simply by pushing them back together again. This was not possible with the runs using lime.<br>

Accordingly it appears to be the case that by using what are cheaper ingredients than the pure oxides one can obtain a fibre that has as high a performance as using purer oxides and at much improved energy costs and safety. It is to be noted that this feature of the invention is not limited to saline soluble fibres and any oxide fibre that contains both calcium and silicon can advantageously be made with a calcium silicate, wollastonite being merely an example of such a silicate.<br>
The previous description is directed towards high temperature usage of particular saline soluble fibres. The following is directed towards the prediction and use of saline soluble fibres. A series of fritted glass melts were made of the compositions shown in Tables 11A and 11B and quenched in water. Solubilities of the various components of the quenched melt were measured by the previously described method of atomic absorption. The solubilities were normalised to a specific surface area of 0.25m2/gram of fibre.<br>
The free energy of hydration was calculated by normalising the chemical analysis to 100 weight %; making the assumption that simple silicates (MSiO3/M2SiO3) are present<br>
and calculating the free energy of hydration contribution of each species; and summing to get the total free energy of hydratipn. The data in Tables 11A &amp; 11B is also presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that the fibres lie on a generally straight line bar four groups of materials that will be explained below.<br>
Table 11 shows in each column the following:-<br>

The base data on which calculation of the free energy of hydration was done is set out in Tables 12 which indicates free energies of hydration taken from the literature in the units kcal/raol and kJ/mol.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
TABLE 12<br>
Although calculations were undertaken assuming the presence of the simplest silicates choice of other silicates (such as disilicates) does not appear to change the calculations much. For example given below is the calculation for an assumed composition which shows only minor differences for the free energy of hydration calculated.<br><br>
Composition (moles/lOOg)<br>
 (Table Removed)<br><br>
The applicants have found that when the free energy of hydration is more negative than -10kcal/100 grams (-418.4kJ/kg) of composition the composition showed high solubility. The compositions where this relationship broke down were those for which the total solubility was not available (for example those materials containing sodium, where any dissolved sodium would be swamped by the sodium in the saline solution) or where the free energy of hydration of the most likely species present was not available from the literature.<br>
As a test of this technigue the two examples of European Patent No. 0399320 were examined. The disclosed examples had the compositions:-<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Using the above method of calculation Composition 1 had a free energy of hydration of -11.6kcal/100grams (-485.3kJ/kg) whereas Composition 2 had a free energy of hydration of -5.8kcal/100grams (-242.6kJ/kg). This would suggest that Composition 1 would be a saline soluble fibre, and hence physiologically safer than an insoluble fibre; whereas Composition 2 would be predicted to be a relatively insoluble fibre and hence less safe. This is what is disclosed in EP 0399320, the fibres of Composition 2 having a longer lifetime in studies in which the fibres were introduced interperitoneally into rats.<br>
As mentioned above this predictive test can fail under some circumstances. To avoid these difficulties the applicants looked to a different predictive technique, namely the assessment of the amount of non-bridging oxygens present. This is calculated by normalising the chemical analysis to 100 weight%; calculating the molar percentage of each oxide; summing the oxygen-weighted contribution of each oxide to get the total number of oxygens; summing the weighted contribution of each oxide of non-bridging oxygens (see below); and taking the ratio of non-bridging oxygens to the total number of oxygens. The applicants have found that when this figure exceeds 30% the fibres are soluble.<br>
To explain the term non-bridging oxygen one must look to the structure of glasses. Glasses are very stiff liquids and to form usually require the presence of a material that can form a network (usually an oxygen-bridged network). The network may be modified by constituents that contribute non-bridging parts to the network and open the structure of the network and so prevent crystallisation. These materials are usually referred to as network-formers and modifiers respectively.<br>
The terms modifier and network former are well known in the glass industries. Network formers are materials such as<br>
SiO2, P2O5' B2O3 and Geo2 which can form an interconnected network to form the glassy phase. Modifiers are substances such as CaO, Na2O, and K2O which alter the network and have effects on such properties as viscosity and melting point. There are some intermediate materials (such as A1203/ TiO2/ PbO, ZnO and BeO) which can act as both network formers and modifiers depending on the environment and on the amount present.<br>
In the above mentioned test, for calculating the non-bridging oxygens, one ignores the network formers and calculates the contribution of each other oxide. The contribution of each oxide depends on the geometry and charge of each cation in the glass. As examples typical contributions are as follows:-<br>
Ca2+,Mg2+,Sr2+ and other divalent network modifier cations contribute 2 non-bridging oxygens<br>
K+,Na+ and other monovalent network modifier cations contribute 1 non-bridging oxygen<br>
Al ,Ti and other intermediate cations contribute -1 non-bridging oxygen (i.e these oxides reduce the number of non-bridging oxygens)<br>
(Ti is reduced to Ti3+ in most glasses when present in relatively small quantities)<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Table of N.B.O. Calculation for Silicate Melts<br>
TABLE   13    Continued<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 13 shows, for the compositions of Table 11, the calculated figure for non-bonding oxygens and these figures are reproduced in Fig.5. It can be seen that the plot of Fig.5 is more linear than that of Fig.4. Compositions with greater than 30% non-bridging oxygens show high solubility.<br>
To illustrate the method the calculation for one example (the first shown in Table 13) is given below:-<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
% non-bridging oxygens (0.784/1.608)*100 = 48.8%<br>
As an example one can look to European Patent Specification No. 0399320 referred to above. Using this method in relation to that specification Composition 1 has a non-bridging oxygen percentage of 48.2% whereas Composition 2 has a non-bridging oxygen percentage of 19.6%, again predicting that Composition 1 is more soluble than Composition 2.<br>
There is a further criterion which a composition must meet for it to form vitreous fibres, namely that it be capable of forming a glass. The applicants have found a simple test. If the ratio of modifiers to network formers is less than a critical value (for SiO2 based glasses, 1) the composition will generally form a glass. For the purpose of this test reasonable results are obtained if such intermediate materials are treated as networkers. Table 14 shows for a series of compositions in each column:-<br>

shown in tables 9 &amp; 10)<br>

It should be emphasised that this test is a screening one rather than a wholly predictive one as there are several circumstances that may lead to its failure. Among these circumstances are compound formation and inability to quench fast enough to form glass.<br>
Having adopted these tests as a screening method there follows a further step to ascertain whether the composition will form a vitreous fibre. This last step is best examined experimentally as fibre forming ability is a complex function of many physical characteristics, e.g. viscosity, which are often difficult to measure.<br>
