In the framework of this application, alkyl defines straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylethyl, pentyl, hexyl; or alkyl defines cyclic saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, methylcyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Alkyl radicals may be optionally substituted with one or more halo, cyano, oxo, hydroxy, alkyloxy or amino radicals, for example polyhaloalkyl, in particular difluoromethyl and trifluoromethyl.<br>
In the framework of this application, halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
In the framework of this application, alkenyl represents a straight or branched unsatured hydrocarbon radical having one or more double bonds, for example ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl and 1,3-butanedienyl. Alkenyl radicals may be optionally substituted with one or more halo, cyano, oxo, hydroxy, alkyloxy or amino radicals, for example hydroxyethenyl.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salts forms that the compounds according to Formula (I) are able to form. Said salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid ; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salts forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, TV-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said salts forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates that the compounds according to Formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcohol ates.<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to Formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called JV-oxide, particularly those TV-oxides wherein one or more nitrogens of the piperazinyl radical are jV-oxidized.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric forms that the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular,<br>
stereogenic centres may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centres of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral centre, the reference centre. The configuration of the second stereogenic centre is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R*J or [R*,S*J, where R* is always specified as the reference centre and [R*,R*] indicates centres with the same chirality and [/?*,Â£"*] indicates centres of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral centre in the molecule has an 5" configuration and the second centre is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R*, S*]. If "a" and "p" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system (hydrogen atom in compounds of Formula(l) ) relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "P", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) and some of the intermediates have at least two stereogenic centres in their structure, respectively denoted a and b in Formula (I). Due to the synthetic pathway followed for the synthesis of the tricyclic system, the configuration of those two asymmetric centres a and b is predetermined, so that the relative configuration of centre a is S* and of centre b is R*.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "prodrugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Prodrugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Prodrugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further<br>
discussion on prodrugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs,  1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Prodrugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the jV-oxide form thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COOR", where Rx is a l, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula- CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, Ci-6alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, Ci-ealkyl, phenyl or benzyl..<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyse with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers that can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated there from by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemicaUy isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemicaUy isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound would be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>

The present invention thus also relates to compounds of Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the //-oxide form thereof, as well as the pro-drugs thereof for use as a medicine, in particular for treating depression, anxiety, movement disorders, psychosis, Parkinson's disease and body weight disorders.<br>
The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention, in particular a compound according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof or a prodrug as defined above.<br>
The compounds of the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof and the prodrugs, or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, by parenteral injection or by inhalation. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other<br>
ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
The compounds according to the invention may also be suitable as add-on treatment and/or prophylaxis in the above listed diseases in combination with any combination of compounds selected from the group of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and/or anti-Parkinson's disease drugs which are currently available or in development or which will become available in the future, to improve efficacy and/or onset of action. This is evaluated in rodent models in which antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and/or anti-Parkinson's disease drugs are shown to be active. For example, compounds are evaluated in combination with antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and/or anti-Parkinson's disease drugs for attenuation of stress-induced hyperthermia.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the<br>
stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof, and the prodrugs and one or more other compounds selected from the group of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and/or anti-Parkinson's disease drugs.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising mixing a compound according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof, and the prodrugs, or any subgroup thereof and a compound selected from the group of antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics and anti-Parkinson's disease drugs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of a compound according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide form thereof, and the prodrugs, for the manufacture of a medicament for treating depression, anxiety, movement disorders, psychosis, schizophrenia and body weight disorders.<br>
In vitro receptor and neurotransmitter transporter binding and signal-transduction studies can be used to evaluate the a2-adrenoceptor antagonism activity and serotonin<br>
(5-HT) reuptake inhibitor activity of the present compounds. As indices for central penetration and potency to block the a2-adrenoceptors and serotonin transporters,<br>
respectively, ex vivo a2-adrenoceptor and serotonin transporter occupancy can be used. As indices of ct2-adrenoceptor antagonism in vivo, the reversal of the loss of righting<br>
reflex, observed in rats after subcutaneous injection or oral dosage of the compound before intravenous medetomidine administration in rats can be used (medetomidine-test). As indices of serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibition activity, the inhibition of head-twitches and excitation in rats, observed after subcutaneous injection or oral dosage of the compound before subcutaneous p-chloroamphetamine administration in rats can be used (pCA-test).<br>
The compounds according to the invention can generally be prepared by a succession of steps, each of which is known to the skilled person.<br>
In particular, the compounds according to Formula (1) can be prepared by a reaction (generally called a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction) with an amine of<br>
Formula (V) on an intermediate compound according to Formula (IV),<br>

wherein all variables, except for R1 and R2, have the same meaning as in Formula (I), at least one of R1 and R2 is an halogen and at most one of R1 and R2 is selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxy, cyano, halo, OSO2H, OSO2CH3, N-RloRn, alkyloxy, alkyloxyalkyloxy, alkyloxyalkyloxyalkyloxy, tetrahydroruranyloxy, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylthio, alkyloxyalkylcarbonyloxy, pyridinylcarbonyloxy, alkylcarbonyloxyalkyloxy, alkyloxycarbonyloxy, alkenyloxy, alkenylcarbonyloxy and mono- or di(alkyl)amino-alkyloxy.<br>
Such a reaction can also be formulated either as<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Said reaction may be carried out in a reaction inert solvent such as pyridine, in the presence of a suitabele base such as KF and at a temperature between room and reflux temperature.<br>
The substituents R1 and R2 may be changed or interconverted into each other by methods well known in the art, such as demethylation, acylation, esterification, animation and amidation. In particular, some of the reactions known to apply for the reduction of secondary amines can be applied, for instance the reduction of a benzylamine radical to the corresponding amine-radical using for instance HBr and acetic acid or the synthesis of a secondary amine radical from a primary amine radical by the reaction with an isocyanate or an acylhalide in an appropriate reaction-inert solvent, such as trichloromethane in the presence of a suitable base, such as triethylamine.<br>
The starting materials and some of the intermediate compounds are compounds that are either commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art.<br>
The intermediate compounds, in particular the intermediate compounds according to Formula (IV), more in particular according to Formula (IVa), (IVb) and (IVc) can be prepared according to various ways.<br>
In particular, the compounds according to Formula (IVlla), i.e. compounds according to Formula (IV) with a Pir-radical according to Formula (Ila) can be prepared by a nucleophilic substitution reaction with a substituted piperazine according to Formula (VI) on an intermediate compound of Formula (VII). These reactions may be carried out in a reaction inert solvent such as dioxane, methylisobutylketone or N,W-dimethylforniamide, in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or triethylamine, or even without a base, using in this latter case excess of reagent of Formula (VI). Convenient reaction temperatures range between<br>
100Â°Candl50Â°C.<br>

(In the intermediate compound of Formula (VII), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy.<br>
The compounds according to Formula (IVlla) can also be prepared by a 2-step reaction scheme in which an intermediate compound of Formula (VII) is first reacted (step 1) with a substituted piperazine according to Formula (VIII) after which the R3-radical is introduced into the resulting intermediate compound of Formula (IX) (step 2). Reaction conditions are similar to those described above for intermediate compounds of Formula<br>
In intermediate compound of Formula (VII), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy.<br>
One of the nitrogen functions of the substituted piperazine of Formula (VIII) may also be protected, e.g. by a tert-butyloxycarbonyl-group.<br>
In the compound of Formula (X), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in<br>
particular halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as<br>
methylsulphonyloxy or 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy. Also, R3"CHO may be used<br>
instead of a compound of Formula (X) wherin R3 has the same meaning as in Formula<br>
(I).<br>
The compounds according to Formula (IVlla) can also be prepared by a 2-step reaction scheme in which an intermediate of Formula (IX) is reacted with an acid according to Formula (XI) (step 1), followed by a subsequent reduction of the carbonyl-function of the intermediate compound of Formula (XII) (step 2). Reactions of step 1 may be carried out in a reaction inert solvent, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or a mixture thereof, using any of methods known to a person skilled in the art using condensation reagents such as 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole,.7/,A^-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or by previous transformation of carboxylic acid of Formula (XI) into its corresponding acid chloride. Reactions shown in step 2 can be performed using a suitable reducing agent, such as lithium-aluminum hydride or aluminum hydride, in a suitable solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran. Generally, these reactions are run at a temperature ranging between -20Â°C and room temperature.<br><br>

In the intermediate compounds of Formula (XI), (XII) and (XIII), the A-group represents an optionally substituted aromatic homocyclic or heterocyclic ring system including a partially or completely hydrogenated hydrocarbon chain of maximum 5 atoms long of which one or more carbon atoms may be replaced by one or more atoms selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, with which the ring system is<br>
attached to the Pir radical that has been defined above.<br>
Intermediate compounds of Formula (VII) in which X=O may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme :<br>
In intermediate compound of Formula (XV), L represents any suitable reactive leaving group, in particular halo, such as chloro, bromo or iodo or sulfonyloxy, such as methylsulphonyloxy or 4-methylbenzenesulfonyloxy. Furthermore, Alk in intermediate compound of Formula (XV) represents any C|-6 alkyl-group, in particular an ethyl-group and m is defined as in Formula (I).<br>
Intermediates according to Formula (VII) in which X=NH may also be prepared in an equivalent manner according to above step 1 a, provided that the intermediate compound of Formula (XIV) is replaced by its amine-analog of Formula (XVII), preferably with the amine group protected with e.g. a COCFa- group. The alkylation step may be carried out in a reaction inert solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide, in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium or potassium hydride, and the addition of a crown-ether, such as 18-crown-6 or 15-crown-5. Convenient reaction temperatures range between room temperature and 60Â°C.<br>
Intermediates of Formula (XVIII) are converted to oximes of Formula (XIX) using art-known techniques, such as using hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of NaHCOa or pyridine in a reaction inert solvent, for example ethanol (step 2).<br>
C<br>
Intermediate compounds of Formula (XIX) are oxidized to their nitril oxides and undergoes in situ an intramolecular cycloaddition, yielding intermediate compounds of Formula (XX). This oxidation can be carried out using a sodium hypochlorite solution in the presence of triethylamine in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane at room temperature. Oxidation can also be performed using Chloramine-T (./V-chloro-4-methyl-benzenesulfonamide, sodium salt), stirring and heating in a solvent such as refluxing ethanol. At this stage the two stereocentres a and b of Formula (IV) are formed.<br>
Preparation of an intermediate compound of Formula (XXI) can be achieved using procedures known in the art, for instance by reduction of the carbonyl compound of Formula (XX) in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, for example, sodiumborohydride in a suitable solvent, such as water, an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof, generally at room temperature.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
The intermediate compound of Formula (VII) can be prepared from intermediate compound of Formula (XXI) using standard techniques. Thus, reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride or 4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, in a reaction inert solvent, for example dichloromethane, at<br>
reaction temperatures ranging between 0Â°C and room temperature, yields the corresponding sulfonyloxy derivative intermediate compound of Formula (VII). The corresponding halo-derivative can also be prepared, e.g. treating intermediate compound of Formula (XXI) with triphenylphosphine, in the presence of tetrachloromethane, in a reaction inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, stirring and refluxing the mixture.<br>
It is evident that in the foregoing and in the following reactions, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as extraction, crystallization and chromatography. It is further evident that reaction products that exist in more than one enantiomeric form, may be isolated from their mixture by known techniques, in particular preparative chromatography, such as preparative HPLC. Typically, intermediate compounds (VII) and (IV) and final compounds according to Formula (I) may be separated into their enantiomeric forms.<br>
Compounds according to the invention in which X=CH2 may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme (Scheme 1) in which an intermediate compound according to Formula (VI) is first Af-alkylated with a dihaloderivative of Formula<br>
using standard techniques, in the presence or absence of a base and in an inert<br>
reaction solvent, such as chloroform, dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, and at<br>
reaction temperatures ranging between room temperature and 80Â°C, yielding an<br>
intermediate compound of Formula (XXIII). An aldehyde of Formula (XXIV) is<br>
reacted with ter/'-butylamine (XXV) in an aprotic solvent such as toluene, stirring and<br>
heating at reflux temperature with removal of water using a standard device, such as a<br>
Dean-Stark water separator, yielding an imine of Formula (XXVI). C-alkylation of<br>
intermediate compound of Formula (XXVI) with intermediate compound of Formula<br>
can be achieved in the presence of an alkyl-lithium derivative, such as n-<br>
butyllithium, under an inert atmosphere and in a dry inert solvent, such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran, at low temperatures ranging between -78Â°C and 0Â°C, yielding an<br>
intermediate compound of Formula (XXVII). The intermediate compound of Formula<br>
(XXVIII) may be prepared by reaction of intermediate compound of Formula (XXVII) with hydroxylamine, in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate, in a solvent such as a lower alkyl-alcohol like ethanol, generally at room temperature. Finally, the oxidation of the oxime derivative of Formula (XXVIII) to its nitril oxide and subsequent in situ cycloaddition to give an intermediate compound of Formula (XXIX), may be achieved by similar standard techniques such as those described above for intermediate compound of Formula (XIX) to give intermediate compounds of Formula (Figure Remove)<br>

Example Cl : Binding experiment for a?-adrenergic receptor subtypes and for<br>
5-HT transporter<br>
The interaction of the compounds of Formula (I) with ha2-receptors and H5-HT-<br>
transporters was assessed in in vitro radioligand binding experiments. In general, a low concentration of a radioligand with a high binding affinity for a particular receptor or transporter is incubated with a sample of a tissue preparation enriched in a particular receptor or transporter or with a preparation of cells expressing cloned human receptors in a buffered medium. During the incubation, the radioligand binds to the receptor or transporter. When equilibrium of binding is reached, the receptor bound radioactivity is separated from the non-bound radioactivity, and the receptor- or transporter-bound activity is counted. The interaction of the test compounds with the receptor is assessed in competition binding experiments. Various concentrations of the test compound are added to the incubation mixture containing the receptor- or transporter preparation and<br>
the radioligand. The test compound in proportion to its binding affinity and its concentration inhibits binding of the radioligand. The radioligand used for ha2A&gt;<br>
ha,2C receptor binding was [-^HJ-raulwolscine and for the h5-HT transporter<br>
was [3H]paroxetine.<br>
Cell culture and membrane preparation.<br>
CHO cells, stabile transfected with human adrenergic-azA-, -a.2B or 0:20 receptor cDNA, were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/Nutrient mixture Ham's F12 (ratio l:l)(Gibco, Gent-Belgium) supplemented with 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Merelbeke-Belgium) and antibiotics (100 lU/ml penicillin G, 100 ug/ml streptomycin sulphate, 110 ug/ml pyruvic acid and 100 ug/ml L-glutamine). One day before collection, cells were induced with 5 mM<br>
sodiumbulyrate. Upon 80-90 % of confluence, cells were scraped in phosphate buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and collected by centrirugation at 1500 x g for 10 min. The cells were homogenised in Tris-HCl 50 mM using an Ultraturrax homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 23,500 x g. The pellet was washed once by resuspension and rehomogenization and the final pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl, divided in 1 ml aliquots and stored at -70Â°C.<br>
Binding experiment for a?-adrenergic receptor subtypes<br>
Membranes were thawed and re-homogenized in incubation buffer (glycylglycine 25 mM, pH 8.0). In a total volume of 500 ul, 2-10 ug protein was incubated with [3H]raulwolscine (NET-722) (New England Nuclear, USA) (1 nM final concentration) with or without competitor for 60 min at 25Â°C followed by rapid filtration over GF/B filter using a Filtermatel96 harvester (Packard, Meriden, CT). Filters were rinsed extensively with ice-cold rinsing buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 7.4). Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in a Topcount (Packard, Meriden, CT) and results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 uM oxymetazoline for ha.2A- and haas receptors and 1 uM spiroxatrine for ha^c receptors.<br>
Binding experiment for 5-HT transporter<br>
Human platelet membranes (Oceanix Biosciences Corporation, Hanover, MD, USA) were thawed, diluted in buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, 120 mM NaCl and 5 mM KC1) and quickly (max 3 s) homogenised with an Ultraturrax homogenizer. In a total volume of 250 uL, 50-100 ug protein was incubated with [3H]paroxetine (NET-869) (New England Nuclear, USA) (0.5 nM final concentration) with or without competitor for 60 min at 25 Â°C . Incubation was stopped by rapid filtration of the incubation mixture over GF/B filters, pre-wetted with 0.1 % polyethyleneamine, using a Filtermatel96 harvester (Packard, Meriden, CT). Filters were rinsed extensively with ice-cold buffer and radioactivity on the filters was counted in a Topcount liquid scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Data were expressed as cpm. Imipramine (at 1 uM final concentration) was used to determine the non-specific binding.<br>
Data analysis and results<br>
Data from assays in the presence of compound were calculated as a percentage of total binding measured in the absence of test compound. Inhibition curves, plotting percent of total binding versus the log value of the concentration of the test compound, were<br>
automatically generated, and sigmoidal inhibition curves were fitted using non-linear regression. The pICso values of test compounds were derived from individual curves.<br>
All compounds according to formula (I) produced an inhibition at least at the ha2A si<br>
(but often also at the hcc2B and hoc2C sites) and simultaneously at the 5-HT transporter<br>
site of more than 50 % (pICso) at a test concentration ranging between<br>
10~6 M and 10'9 M in a concentration-dependent manner.   Results are shown in Table<br>
