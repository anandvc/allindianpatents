CEI1/HSSUE CULTURING DEVICE, SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FIELD OFTHE INVENTION<br>
Tbeinyetifion is of a device, system and method for cell/tissue culture, and in particular, of such a deviee,. system and method for plant cell culture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cell and tissue culture techniques have been available for many years and are well known in the art. Theprospect of using such culturing techniques economically is for the extraction of secondary metabolites, such as phaimaceutically active compounds.; various -substances to be used in cosmetics, hormones, enzymes, proteins, antigens, food additives and natural pesticides, from a harvest of the cultured cells= or ^tissues. .While potentially lucrative, this prospect has nevertheless not been effectively. exploited with industrial scale bioreactors which use slow growing pl&amp;t^d Animal cell cultures, because of the high capital costs involved.<br>
Backgrbuntl'art technology for the production of cell and/or tissue culture at industrial scale,' to. tie! used' for the production of such materials, is currently based on . glass bioreactojns-.and stainless steel bioreactors, which are expensive capital items. Furthermore- these- types of industrial bioreactors comprise complicated and expensive mixing-technologies such as impellers powered through expensive and complicated sterile seals;.soirie expetisive fennentors comprise an airlift multipart /construction;^. Suc^essfiil, operation of these bioreactors often requires the implementation

capacity biofeacf6t?: namely, to -provide a number of smaller glass or stainless steel<br>
bioreactors :&gt;syfioseVtOteiI yplume capacity-matches requirements, while offering a<br>
degree of flejaljiSt^for increasing orreducing.overall capacity, is nevertheless much<br>
more e^en^e'\0^n.th[e provision" of a single larger bioreactor. Furthermore,<br>
T^ESs^%p^^4^^^^^^VBip^^s&amp; and stainless steel bioreactors are also high,<br>
due to ■ low^ji'j&amp;i^^^	sterilize the bioreactors after every<br><br>
culturing cycle.. Cqnseqtientiiyj the products extracted from cells or tissues grown in such bioreactors.i^.exp0iisiye, and cannot at present compete commercially with comparable, .prodnpte.produced with alternative techniques. In fact, only one Japanese compm^'is-foown to use the aforementioned cell/tissue culture technique a&gt;mmertiaUy^i§mg starless; steel bioreactors. This company produces Shikonin, a compound wM^h.iS-used'^hnbst exclusively in Japan.<br>
Indiistrial-'Scale, aixd even large scale, bioreactor devices are traditionally permanent;or'set^-pehnaient&gt; components, and no disclosure nor suggestion of the concept of a disposable bioreactor device for solving Ihe aforementioned problems regarding large' scale, cell/tissue culture production is known of. On the contrary, -disposable feimefitors and bioreactor devices are well known and exclusively directed to very small scale production volumes, such as in home brewing and for laboratory work. \ These bioreactor devices generally comprise a disposable bag which is. typipally cut open in.prder to harvest the cell/tissue yield, thus destroying any further ;us^]gte$s of the bag. One such known disposable bioreactor is produced by Osmotic, I^agl; (Agritech Israel, issue No. 1, Fall 1997, page 19) for small-scale use such as in ia|):0rat6ry research-. This bioreactor comprises a conical bag having an inlet through i^hich culture medium, air, inoculant and other optional additives may be introducedi/and h,as a volume of only about 1.5 litexs. Aeration is performed by introducing very stnall air bubbles which, in many cases, results in damage to cells, particularly'jri the. case.of plant cell cultures. In particular, these bags are specifically 4e?5igJi€d for asingle ciilture/harvest cycle only, and the bag contents are removed by cujHijig^ off the bottom of the bag- These bags are therefore not directed towards an: ecbnpinCal ?olutipn to Jhe question of providing industrial quantities of •    the materials/fcbe extracted ffom.the culture, as discussed above.<br>
The te^n ^disposable" in the present application means that the devices (bags,<br>
biore^dors etp.)^dfe' designed to be discarded after use with only negligible, loss.<br>
Thus devices ^aldefiorn stainless steel or glass are necessarily expensive devices and<br>
do not cdn?titute;a?ii^gjigiblelo,ss for the operator of such devices. On the other hand,<br>
devices, mad^iife;^^	flexible plastics, for example, are relatively<br>
inexp^iave-^^j^Y^ttie^fpip.be,-and are, disposed of after use with negligible economic loss^T%^ttie^disposability of these bioreactor devices does not generally present an. ec^npi^e.:.disadvantage to the u^er, since even the low capital costs of<br><br>
these items&amp;'Ofisef against ease of use, storage and other practical considerations. In fact, at the small: scale production levels to which these devices are directed, such is the ecoiaom^ Of :the devices that there is no motivation to increase the complexity of the device bj it$Gpea#tion_in orderto allow such a device to be used repeatedly for more than one c^ti^^h^vesting cycle.<br>
Furthdri:&amp;e*ile■'. oonditions outside the disposable bioreactor devices are neithern^eff ii6i^-possible:in many cases, and thus once opened to extract the harvestable )d?WJHf is,neither cost-effective, nor practical, nor often possible to maintaiu- the opting, stenle,* leading to contamination of the bag and whatever contents may.yemaiitinsidfe. Thus, these disposable devices have no further use after one culturing cydie:  * - .<br>
Disposable bioreactor devices are thus relatively inexpensive for the quantities andipfo^uction-volumes which are typically required by non-industrial-scale users, afl^. are relatively easy to use by non-professional personnel.

SUMMARY OF t5E INVENTION<br>
The background art does not teach or suggest a device, system or method for industrial-scale production of materials through plant or animal cell culture with a disposable device. The background art also does not teach or suggest such a device, system or method for industrial-scale plant cell culture.<br>
The present- invention overcomes these deficiencies of the background art by<br>
providing: a;deyipei?yst^m.aiid method for axenically culturing and harvesting cells<br>
and/or tissues^; including- biojreactors and fermentors. The device is preferably<br>
disposable but nevertheless iqaay be used.continuously for a plurality of consecutive<br>
cnilturing/haryfestttig.cycles prior to disposal of same. This invention also relates to<br>
batteries of such-deyices \vhich may be used for large-scale production of cells and<br>
tissues.  •       •   "., /	• ;   .<br>

Following stable tr^nsfonnation plant propagation can be exercised. The most cotnmon. method: of plant -propagation is by seed, or by micropropagation, which involves tissue cultoing, tissue culture multiplication, differentiation and plant formation.<br>

When the virus is a DNA-:virus, suitable modifications can be made to the<br>
vims itself . Alternatively, the virus can first be cloned into a bacterial plasmid for<br>
ease of constructing the desired viral vector with the foreign DNA. The virus can<br>
then be excised from theiplasmid.. If the virus is a DNA virus, a bacterial origin of<br>
replication can be .attached to/the viral DNA, which is then replicated by the bacteria.<br>
Transcription: £nd frataslstiori of this DNA will produce the coat protein which will<br>

Then, flie exogenous nucleic acid is. introduced via particle bcwnbardment into the cells with thtJ^idm^ofiritrbdiidpLg a£ least one exogenous.nucleic acdd molecule into the chn&gt;|tooplaste?^?Hhie exogenous nucleic add is selected such fhat it is integratable into the diroiippl^s-genome via homologotis recombination, which is readily effected by eriigah^s inherent i$ the ^nromoplast To this aid, the exogenous nucleic<br><br>
acid inc^e^%Sd3ition io a geaie of interest, at least one nucleic add stretch which<br>
is derived froin the chromoplastfs genome. In addition, the exogenous nucleic acid includes a selectable marker; which serves by sequential selection procedures to ascertain that-all: or substantially all of the copies of the chromoplast genomes following suclv selection will include the exogenous nucleic acid. Further details relating to thfe;technique are found in U.S. Pat Nos. 4,945,050; and 5,693,507 which areiricciporated herein by reference. A polypeptide can thus be produced by the protein expression system of the. chromoplast and become integrated into the chromoplast1 s inner, membrane.<br>
It shotud be appreciated that a drug resistance or other selectable marker is intended in"Mrtoto"facilitate the selection of the transfonnants. Additionally, the presence- of ar^el^abl^marker, such as drug resistance marker may be of use in detecting ;the ^es^iee of contaminating microorganisms in the fculture, and/or in the case of a r^^tmeVmarker ba^ed upon resistance to a chemical or other factor, the selection conditions), mayalso optionally and preferably prevent undesirable and/or contaminatinglriri^porg^sins froin multiplying in the culture medium. Such a pure culture of the%aiisfonned host: cell: would be obtained by culturing the cells under conditions which are.required for the induced phenotype's survival.<br>

[■  fi:;-	ILLUSTRATIVE SYSTEM<br>
The'.prbseiit.-invention also* relates to a battery of disposable devices for axenically cultunrig.and harvesting dells and/or tissue in cycles, wherein each of a plurality of thipse-devices, is structurally and operationally similar to device (10), hereinbefore defined and .described with reference to the first through the fifth embodiments thereof..      ;<br>
Referring to JFIG. 10, a battery (500) comprises a plurality of devices (10), as hereinbefore described with respect, to any one of the first through the fifth emboditnents^fefchrate heft on. a frame or frames (not shown) with an attacher or support structure $00), for example* Typically, the battery (500) may be divided into a numbpr ofgrouj^eaojtf group comprising a number of devices (10).<br>
In the j*^^	battery (500), the air inlets of the devices<br>
(10) in .each';sp&gt;JD$f;jffe iirterebtoected/ITius the air inlet pipes. (74) of each device (10) of the. grdup1ate conheclbd to common piping (174) having a free end (170), which is^ prpAgj^; with vsx. ^afeeptic; connector (175). Sterilized air is provided by a suitable air corn^^soi: (15&amp;) fiaviiig a suitable st«rilizeF orblocker (110) sudi as one or more ^teas. IheVcompcesspr (130) comprises a delivery pipe (101) having an aseptic eomecjbr.(136) aWtyfr^e end which is typically connectable to the aseptic connector (175) located at tKe.free end of common p^&gt;ing (174). This connection is made at.liebeginafing of ea6h. run of growth/harvesting cycles in a mobile sterile hood (380) .to .ensure/thai sterile conditions are .maintained durmg the connection.<br><br>
The sterile hood provides a simple relatively low-cost system for connecting the various services, such as air, media, inoculant and harvested cells, to and from the group of devices (10); wider substantially sterile conditions. Similarly, at the end of each run of gr6wfli/harvesting .cycles, the connectors (175) and (176) are disconnected in the stjeril^hdod (380), and the used devices are discarded, allowing the connector* (3 75) atltKe compressor end to be connected to the connector (176) of a new group'.Qffdeyices. Sterilized /air is typically provided continuously, or alternatively att^^^fefppin^i pulses, during each culturing cycle.<br>
In the^r^esxpd embodiment of the battery (500), excess air and/or waste<br>
gases from eaph;£&gt;f^be' .devices (10) is removed to the atmosphere via common-<br>
piping (290) .^|a^;cbn&amp;ected to each corresponding gas outlet (90). Common<br>
piping (290) i^p^^doi^itli'a suitable contaminant preventer (210), such as one or<br>
more filters, '$&amp;V-pn^&amp;ing contaminants from flowing into devices (10).<br>
Alternatively the j^s Outlet (90) of each device (10) may be individually allowed to<br>
vent to;ffie:dlmc$^pB«re,^ jnreYeKLbly via suitable filters which substantially prevent<br>
