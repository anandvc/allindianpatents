INFUSION FABRIC FOR MOLDING<br>
LARGE COMPOSITE STRUCTURES<br>
Technical Field and Industrial Applicability of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to an infusion fabric that may be molded into large<br>
composite structures as well as to a novel continuous filament mat and a novel binder<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Reinforcement fabrics made from fibrous materials formed into woven, knitted and<br>
non-woven material, are well known in the art Yarns of glass, carbon and aramid are<br>
typically formed into fabrics, and a plurality of layers of fabric are stacked and cut into dry<br>
fabric kits 01 performs The preforms are then infused or impregnated with a resin binder<br>
and cured to form a rigid composite<br>
Typically a glass reinforced fibrous mat is preformed and then placed in a mold for<br>
molding into a fiber-reinforced article Glass fiber-remforcement mats arc used in<br>
situations where a desired strength is necessary, such as in truck fenders, auto chassis or<br>
bus components and the like For example, layers of the continuous strand mat and layers<br>
of unidirectional or multidirectional reinforcement material are fabricated separately<br>
These layers arc individually placed in a set of preformed screens, which generally consist<br>
of an upper screen and a lower screen The upper and lower screens arc moved together in<br>
order to conform the layers to the shape of the preformed screens The layers are thus<br>
shaped into what is known as a preform The preform is then placed in a mold and<br>
injected with a suitable resinous material to make the fiber reinforced article<br>
U S Patent Publication No 2005-0070182, published on 31 March 2005, owned<br>
by the assignee of the present invention, discloses a crimp-free infusible reinforcement<br>
fabnc The unidirectional fabric has small size tows spaced between large size tows The<br>
"channels" that are formed from the small tows between the larger tows permit faster resin<br>
infusion and increased productivity<br>
The present invention relates to an improved infusion fabric that better optimizes<br>
kitting, preforming, conformability to tooling, resin infusion rate, consolidation thickness,<br>
surface aesthetics, and composite structural performance in a range of closed molding<br>

invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Detailed Description and Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
A first embodiment of the infusion fabric 10 of the present invention is illustrated<br>
in Figs 1 and la As illustrated the infusion fabric 10 includes a mat 12 and a woven<br>
roving or bonded reinforcement layer 14 Both the mat 12 and the woven loving<br>
reinforcement layer 14 may be constructed from a material selected from a group<br>
consisting of glass fibers, carbon fibers, graphite fibers, vitreous carbon fibers, non-<br>
graphite carbon fibers, boron monolithic graphite fibers, boron monolithic non graphite<br>
carbon fibers, silicone, aramid, ceramic fibers, thermoplastic polymer fibers, natural fibers<br>
(for example, cotton, kenaf, sisal, jute) and mixtures thereot Of couisc, the mat 12 and<br>
 <br>
woven roving reinforcement layer 14 may be constructed from the same or different<br>
materials from this list as desired<br>
The woven roving reinforcement layer 14 has an arcal weight of between about 8<br>
to about 60 oz/sq yd (about 0 27 to about 2 03 kg/sq m ) The woven roving<br>
reinforcement layer 14 is selected from a group consisting of plain, twill and satm style<br>
The woven roving or bonded reinforcement layer 14 also includes multiple parallel tows<br>
18, 20 at least two tows of which have differing yields so as to form spaced channels 21<br>
The first low 18 of the two tows has a yield A of between about 750 to about 2500 yds/lb<br>
(about 1511 9 to about 5039 7 m/kg) The second tow 20 of the two tows has a yield B of<br>
between about 52 to about 450 yds/lb (about 104 8 to about 907 2 m/kg) By placing one<br>
or more of the smaller first tows 18 between two or more of the larger second tows 20, a<br>
channel 21 is provided A typical woven roving reinfoi cement layer 14 includes a group<br>
of these channels 21 that allow rapid infusion of resin across the infusion fabric 10 during<br>
the molding process<br>
The spacing of the tows 18, 20 is typically determined by the resm utilized in the<br>
molding process More specifically, a more viscous resm requires a greater number of<br>
channels per suifacc area in order to better enhance the flow of resin during the molding<br>
process Alternatively, a less viscous resin flows more easily and requires fewer channels<br>
per surface area In such a situation a fewer number of small tows 18 are required<br>
between a larger number of large tows 20<br>
The woven roving or bonded reinforcement layer 14 typically includes<br>
unidirectional liber orientation Various methods may be utilized to maintain the primary<br>
fibers in position in the unidirectional layer Those methods include weaving, stitching<br>
and bonding as is known in the art In one particularly useful embodiment the layer 14 is<br>
constructed from ciimp-free warped knitted fabric otherwise known as stitch-bonded<br>
fabric In the illustrated embodiment, the lows 18 and 20 oi the woven roving or bonded<br>
reinforcement layer 14 are held in place by a secondary, non-structural stitching thread 22<br>
This may typically be a polyester thread or any other thread conventionally used in the art<br>
The mat 12 and woven roving or bonded reinforcement layer 14 are connected<br>
together by any appropriate means In the illustrated embodiment the connection is<br>
completed by stitch-bonding using conventional stitch-bonding techniques and styles such<br>
as chain, tricot, modified tncot or promal Conventional machines known in the art such<br>
as Liba stitch-bondmg machines may be used for this purpose<br>
 <br>
As also illustrated in Figs 1 and 1 a, the infusion fabric 10 may also include a<br>
second woven roving or bonded reinforcement layci 24 Ihe second woven roving<br>
reinforcement layer 24 has a structure similar to the first woven roving reinfoicemcnl layer<br>
14 that is, the second woven roving or bonded reinforcement layer includes multiple<br>
parallel tows 26, 28 at least two tows of which have differing yields so as to form spaced<br>
channels for resin infusion The tows 26, 28 do not have to have identical yields to the<br>
tows 18, 20 in the first woven roving reinforcement layer 14 It should be appreciated,<br>
however, that the tows 18, 20 of the fust woven roving reinforcement layer 14 extend in a<br>
first direction while the tows 26, 28 ol the second woven roving reinforcement layei 24<br>
extend in a second direction at a bias to the first direction Typically that bias is one of<br>
approximately 90 degrees This structural arrangement adds additional strength to the<br>
infusion fabric 10<br>
An alternative embodiment for the infusion fabric 10 is illustrated in Figs 2 and<br>
2a This embodiment includes a mat 12 and a woven roving or bonded reinforcement<br>
layer 14 substantially identical to that described above with respect to the Fig 1<br>
embodiment In addition, the infusion fabric 10 includes a surfacing mat 30 The<br>
surfacing mat 30 is connected to the face of the mat 12 opposite the woven roving<br>
reinforcement layer 14 so that the mat 12 is sandwiched between the surfacing mat 30 and<br>
the woven roving reinforcement layer 14 The surfacing mat 30 is formed from a print<br>
blocking media such as another continuous fiber mat or a veil incorporating glass fibers,<br>
polyester fibers, natural fibers (for example, cotton, kenaf, sisal, jute), polymer particles<br>
and binder The surfacing mat 30 may, for example, be connected to the mat 12 by spin<br>
bonding, wet bonding, dry bonding and needle punching<br>
As pieviously noted, the mat 12 may be a continuous filament mat For purposes<br>
of this document, "continuous filament" is defined as a colhmated assembly of individual<br>
fibers treated, sized or finished appropriately for wetting and adhering resin or polymer<br>
upon composite consolidation<br>
Also (or purposes of this document, a "continuous filament mat" is defined as a<br>
random swirl placement of continuous bundled fibers which has orientation defined by the<br>
loop formation ratio in the process creating a mat with planar isotropy A useful<br>
continuous filament mat 12 is made utilizing a loop formation latio of between about 2 0<br>
to about 8 0 and typically between about 6 0 and 6 6 (loop formation ratio is strand or<br>
bundle speed/oscillation rate)<br>
 <br>
A continuous filament mat 12 particularly useful in the present invention also<br>
includes E-glass and/or ECR-glass fibers, a binder and a size The glass fibers are<br>
provided as glass filament bundles The glass filament bundles include between about 20<br>
to about 140 filaments per bundle. Each filament has a mean diameter of between about<br>
11 and about 26 microns. The bundle diameter is between about 0 127 and about 3 175<br>
mm.<br>
In a particularly useful embodiment, the mean filament diameter is between about<br>
17 0 and about 20.0 microns. Further, there are between about 44 and about 50 filaments<br>
per bundle or loop strand. The strand or bundle diameter mean is about 0 3048 mm and<br>
the bundle diameter falls m an overall range of between about 0 127 to about 1.27 mm.<br>
The strand to mat architecture or preferred loop formation ratio is between about 6.0 and<br>
about 6 6<br>
The binder is a polyester or an epoxy compatible binder such as a powdered epoxy<br>
resin or an epoxy novolak. Epoxy resins include those made from epichlorohydrin and<br>
bisphenol A. Epoxy novolaks include resins made by reaction of epichlorohydrin with a<br>
novolak resin (phenol-formaldehyde).<br>
In one possible embodiment that polyester binder is based upon ethylene glycol<br>
and fumaric acid. The binder also includes talc and benzoyl peroxide. For a typical<br>
application the binder is ground to a particle size of between about 25 to about 200 mm.<br>
The talc is added as a crystallization enhancer. The binder is prepared by cryogemcally<br>
grinding the crystalline polymer with a little zinc stearate to the desired particle size. The<br>
powder is then dry blended with the benzoyl peroxide. More specifically describing the<br>
binder, the binder includes between about 95 to about 99.8 weight percent polyester,<br>
between about 0.05 to about 3 weight percent talc and between about 0.2 to about 2 weight<br>
percent benzoyl peroxide.<br>
The size utilized in the continuous filament mat 12 includes one or more<br>
formulations incorporating water, acetic acid, silane, and a biocide Silane coupling<br>
agents useful in the present invention include but are not limited to A-187, A-171, A-174<br>
and A-1100 silane available from General Electric Silanes. Lubricants useful in the<br>
present invention include but are not limited to Cirrosol 185AE and 185AN, each<br>
manufactured and sold by ICI America and Omega 16407 Biocides useful in the present<br>
invention include but are not limited to quaternary ammonium compounds containing<br>
 <br>
bis/tnbutyltinoxide. One such biocide is sold under the trademark Biomet 66 and is<br>
available from Atochem.<br>
The continuous filament mat 12 is manufactured by transporting glass filament<br>
bundles through the binder application process on a conveyor chain A portion of the<br>
conveyor chain is supported within an open-ended trough called a flood pan The purpose<br>
of the flood pan is to allow sufficient slurry to accumulate and fully submerse the non-<br>
woven web for some period of time. The slurry is fed from a reservoir located above and<br>
toward the inlet end of the flood pan (that is, the curtain coder). The reservoir discharges<br>
the slurry through its slot on the lowermost portion of the reservoir. The reservoir and slot<br>
extend across the width of the floor pan. The major axes of the reservoir and slot are<br>
oriented perpendicular to the machine direction (major axis) on the process conveyor<br>
The slurry is discharged vertically down from the reservoir slot, in a continuous<br>
curtain, toward the upper surface of the non-woven web of glass strands. The velocity of<br>
the curtain of slurry is a function of the discharge velocity of the slurry from the reservoir<br>
slot, the vertical distance between the slot and the surface of the web and the viscosity of<br>
the slurry.<br>
The non-woven web of glass strands and the conveyor chain are substantially<br>
permeable to the flow of the slurry, allowing the slurry to flow easily around both the glass<br>
strands and the conveyor chain wires and down to the impermeable flood pan. When the<br>
vertical slurry flow from the reservoir impinges on the flat surface of the flood pan<br>
(perpendicular to the surface of the flood pan), the flow is redirected to a horizontal flow.<br>
The flow of slurry upon interacting with the web, conveyor chain and flood pan, is<br>
generally redirected to flow in the same direction as the conveyor and web. The removal<br>
rate of the slurry from the flood pan is a function of the supply rate of slurry into the flood<br>
pan, the thickness of the conveyor chain, the drag of the chain and the slurry, the viscosity<br>
of the slurry, depth of slurry in the flood pan and other factors. The volumetric flow of<br>
slurry supplied by the reservoir is, by design, sufficient to ensure the web is fully<br>
submerged as it is carried through the majority of the length of the flood pan The slurry<br>
flows through the glass strands and leaves a binder deposit which is subsequently cured in<br>
the oven into a bound mat structure.<br>
In order for the continuous filament mat 12 to allow the desired resin infusion, the<br>
glass fiber bundles must not be too large or too close together. Both these aspects affect<br>
the openness or permeability of the mat construction for purposes of resin infusion.<br>
 <br>
Continuous filament mats 12 useful m the present invention include but are not limited to<br>
CFM 8610, CFM 8620, CFM 8630, CFM 8635, CFM 8636 and CFM 8643, commercially<br>
available from the assignee of the present invention<br>
Factors influencing resin infusion for RTM, RTM lite or VIP processes follow<br>
Darcy's law on the need to reduce resin viscosity and increase mat/fabric in-plane<br>
permeability Continuous filament mat permeability to balance resin infusion with mold<br>
conformabihty has been shown to improve with reduced Filamentization, proper solids and<br>
cure of the binder. The random swirl of the mat, continuous fiber and proper sizing/binder<br>
chemistry allow good composite mechanical and structural performance. For purposes of<br>
this document cure is measured as acetone extractables. The continuous filament mat has<br>
a cure of between about 50 to about 100 percent and more typically about 60 to about 90<br>
percent as measured by acetone extractables<br>
The various embodiments of the infusion fabric 10 of the present invention<br>
including those illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 are particularly useful in molding processes<br>
where resin must move through a fabric to create a consolidated composite. One<br>
particular process is resin transfer molding (RTM). Resin transfer molding (RTM) is a<br>
process by which a resin is pumped at low viscosities and low pressures into a closed mold<br>
die set containing a preform of dry fabric, that is, fabric 10 to infuse resin into the preform<br>
and to make a fiber-reinforced composite part. The RTM process can be used to produce<br>
at low cost composite parts that are complex in shape. These parts typically require<br>
continuous fiber reinforcement along with inside mold line and outside mold line<br>
controlled surfaces. The ability to include and place continuous fiber reinforcement in<br>
large and small structures sets RTM apart from other liquid molding processes<br>
The fabric 10 is also useful in a vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM)<br>
system. In VARTM, the preform is covered by a flexible sheet or liner, such as fabric 10.<br>
The flexible sheet or liner is clamped onto the mold to seal the preform in an envelope A<br>
catalyzed matrix resin is then introduced into the envelope to wet the preform. A vacuum<br>
is applied to the interior of the envelope via a vacuum line to collapse the flexible sheet<br>
against the preform. The vacuum draws the resin through the preform and helps to avoid<br>
the formation of air bubbles or voids in the finished article. The matrix resm cures while<br>
being subjected to the vacuum The application of the vacuum draws off any fumes<br>
produced during the cunng process. The fabric 10 of the present invention is useful in<br>
