BROADCASTING USER-SPECIFIC INFORMATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]      The present invention relates to broadcasting user-specific information.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]       Information has become increasingly available to the general puonc in recent years.<br>
Information that took a day or more to disseminate now is typically distributed in a matter of<br>
minutes or even seconds. As access to information increasingly contributes to productivity and<br>
efficiency gains for the economy, an increased emphasis has been placec on timely and accurate<br>
transfer of and access to this information.<br>
[0003]       For many individuals, reviewing information such as financial and business information,<br>
sports and entertainment news and information, traffic and weather infoimation and other<br>
information are intrinsically part of their daily routine. In fact, timely ar d accurate receipt of<br>
information can have a dramatic impact on successful investing, efficient business operations and<br>
positive time-management. Moreover, for many individuals and businesses, information must be<br>
accessible not only when the user is in front of a computer monitor, but when he or she is traveling.<br>
Accordingly, many individuals and businesses have employed various techniques to distribute<br>
information to mobile users, such as transmitting time-sensitive information via cellular<br>
communication.<br>
[0004]       Recently, however, satellite radio has become one mode of broadcasting information to<br>
mobile users. Satellite operators provide digital quality radio broadcast services covering the entire<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
2<br>
continental United States. Plans currently include providing these services around the globe. These<br>
satellite radio services offer many channels including music, news, sports, talk radio and other<br>
programming. Moreover, digital radio is available from conventional analog radio broadcasters that<br>
provide a terrestrial based system using signals co-located in the AM unc FM bands. Satellite radio<br>
improves terrestrial radio's potential by offering a better audio quality (digital quality), greater<br>
coverage and fewer commercials. As such, in October of 1997, the Federal Communications<br>
Commission (FCC) granted two national satellite radio broadcast licenses. The FCC allocated 25<br>
megahertz (MHZ) of the electro-magnetic spectrum for satellite digital b roadcasting, 12.5 MHz of<br>
which are owned by Sirius Satellite Radio and 12.5 MHz of which are owned by XM Satellite Radio<br>
Inc.<br>
[0005]       Satellite radio currently operates as a quasi-open communica ions network to any eligible<br>
user. That is, a channel of satellite radio is available to any user who subscribes to a particular<br>
satellite radio service. For example, a subscriber to XM Satellite Radio or Sirius Satellite Radio can<br>
listen to any programming {e.g., sports talk radio channel) offered by met respective broadcast<br>
provider. Other than general access to a various premium channels, one subscriber's ability to<br>
access specific content is no different than that of a second subscriber, Moreover, content offered by<br>
satellite radio is not customized for a particular subscriber or user. In addition, a non-subscriber to<br>
satellite radio is restricted from listening to any programming offered by the satellite broadcast<br>
â€¢  provider.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0006]       The invention features systems and methods, including computer program products, for<br>
broadcasting user-specific information via radio. More specifically, the description describes<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
3<br>
delivering user-specific information, such as financial information, to an authorized user of a radio<br>
receiver, such as a satellite radio receiver. Aspects utilize digital radio communication to deliver<br>
user-specific content and information to the authorized user. The techniques also discriminate<br>
between satellite radio subscribers by delivering user-specific content su
to only one of the many subscribers of a satellite radio service.<br>
[0007]      In general, in one aspect, systems broadcast user-specific information through a network,<br>
such as a satellite radio service or a digital radio service. In addition, systems include an<br>
information provider that further includes a first server in communication with the network. The<br>
first server retrievably stores user-specific information. Systems of the present invention also<br>
include a broadcast provider (e.g., satellite or digital radio) that further includes a second server in<br>
communication with the network. The first and/or second database servers further include at least<br>
one identifier that is associated with a user or receiver (satellite or digita. radio.) The receiver is<br>
associated with the user. The receiver also is in communication with the: network, and provides an<br>
authorized user with access to the user-specific information that is broadcast by the broadcast<br>
provider. The receiver can be in communication with a second server to selectively receive the<br>
information specific to the user. In addition, the first and/or second servers can include a database<br>
server.<br>
[0008]       In another aspect, methods provide for broadcasting user-spepne information.<br>
Generally, methods include receiving information specific. The informs ition is correlated with an<br>
identifier associated with a receiver associated with the user. In addition, methods include<br>
broadcasting the information to the receiver, such that use of the information is restricted to the<br>
receiver.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
4<br>
[0009]       In another aspect, methods include providing user-specific information from an<br>
information provider. The information provider includes a first server that is in communication with<br>
a network (such as satellite or digital radio.) In addition, the first server letrievably stores the user-<br>
specific information. The information provider also can include a server that further includes<br>
information that is associated with a specific user.<br>
[0010]       In this aspect, methods correlate the user-specific information received from the<br>
information provider with a second server operated by a broadcast provider (satellite or digital<br>
radio.) The second server is in communication with the network, and can be a database server.<br>
Networks include, for example, satellite radio and digital (high-definition) radio. In general,<br>
correlating includes matching the user-specific information with an ideniifier that is associated with<br>
a receiver. The receiver can be a satellite radio receiver or a digital, high definition radio receiver.<br>
Methods also include broadcasting the user-specific information to the appropriate receiver. The<br>
identifier allows an authorized user of the receiver to access the user-ispecific information.<br>
[0011]      The techniques described herein allow for a plurality of different users to receive user-<br>
specific information (i.e., customized information) on the same channel. For example, a broadcast<br>
over a single digital signal (or channel) can include a plurality of user-specific information, each of<br>
which is unique to a particular receiver or user. For example, a "FID EL ITY" channel can broadcast<br>
various digital information over a certain frequency that includes user-specific information that is<br>
uniquely associated to one of a plurality of receivers or users. As such, in information or broadcast<br>
provider can transmit user-specific information to a particular user or receiver over one broadcast<br>
channel or signal. In operation, each of a plurality of user-specific information broadcast over a<br>
digital channel can include an identifier that is associated with a particular receiver. The identifier<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
5<br>
allows an authorized user of the receiver to access the user-specific information. In addition, the<br>
receiver including the identifier unique to the receiver can use the information specific to the user.<br>
Likewise, the receivers not including the identifier unique to the receiver will not be able to use the<br>
information specific to the user.<br>
[0012]       In some embodiments, the identifier can act as the "key" for decrypting or de-<br>
multiplexing the signal. The identifier can also be encrypted. In some embodiments, a user can<br>
input a personal identification code ('TIN" code) so that he or she can access or use the information<br>
specific to the user. Like the identifier, the PIN code can also be enciyp :ed.<br>
[0013]      In some embodiments, a network includes a plurality of receivers. Each of the plurality<br>
of receivers is associated with an identifier that is unique to each of the respective plurality of<br>
receivers. In some embodiments, the receiver-specific identifier is stored at a server (e.g., database<br>
server) of the broadcast provider. The broadcast provider broadcasts user-specific information with<br>
the identifier so that only the receiver associated with the identifier is able to access the user-specific<br>
information. As such, the receiver selectively receives information specific to the user based on the<br>
identifier unique to the receiver.<br>
[0014]       Also in some embodiments, the network includes at least one: web server. The web<br>
server is in communication with the network. The web server allows for accessing and distributing<br>
information, user-specific or general information via the Internet. In some embodiments, the web<br>
server also directs or disseminates information between the first and sec and database servers. The<br>
web server can act uni-directionally or bi-directionally (i.e., send and/or receive) between the first<br>
and second database servers.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
6<br>
[0015]      Also, some embodiments can include a third database server that functions in a manner<br>
similar to the first server (operated by the information provider.) Likewise, some embodiments<br>
include a second information provider, which itself includes a server (i.e., third server) that is in<br>
communication with a network. The third database server also retrievably stores user-specific<br>
information, and can be a database server. Furthermore, in other embodiments, a third server of an<br>
information provider contains user-specific information that is redundant to or different from the<br>
second server. In such embodiments, the third database server can be in communication with the<br>
network. Like the second server, the third server also can correlate or match user-specific<br>
information with an identifier that is associated with a receiver (e.g., a satellite or digital radio<br>
receiver.) As such, the third server can broadcast the user-specific information to the appropriate<br>
receiver. The broadcast allows an authorized user of the receiver to acce ss the user-specific<br>
information.<br>
[0016]       Also, some embodiments include a third server that functions' in a manner similar to the<br>
second server (operated by the broadcast provider.) As such, multiple broadcast providers (and their<br>
respective servers) are in communication with the network. Like the second server, the third server<br>
also can correlate or match the user-specific information with an identifier that is associated with a<br>
satellite receiver, for example. Examples can include broadcasting the user-specific information to<br>
the appropriate receiver. The broadcast allows an authorized user of the receiver to access the user-<br>
specific information.<br>
[0017] As provided herein, the techniques allow for broadcasting user specific information to a<br>
receiver that is uniquely associated with an identifier. Only the appropr ate receiver will be able to<br>
access user-specific information intended to be disseminated to a particular user. User-specific<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
7<br>
information, can include financial information. Financial information mat is user-specific includes,<br>
among other things, a security ticker symbol, such as DELL (Dell, Inc.), MSFT (Microsoft<br>
Corporation) or GE (General Electric Company.) Financial information ilso can include the<br>
security name, such as Dell, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, or General Electric Company, thereby<br>
aiding an individual who is not able to associate a ticker symbol with the respective company.<br>
[0018]      Without limitation, the security and/or the security symbol ar s not limited to stocks, but<br>
can include its derivatives (e.g., options) or other publicly or privately traded securities such as<br>
mutual funds, bonds, commodities (e.g., gold, gas or corn) or other trading vehicles (e.g., REITs and<br>
private funds). Moreover, without limitation, the types of accounts for which financial information<br>
can be disseminated include retirement accounts (e.g., IRA or 401K accounts), trading accounts<br>
(Fidelity Investment account), and other accounts that typically is monitored by a broker, for<br>
example.<br>
[0019]      In addition, in some embodiments, financial information includes a security quote. For<br>
example, a satellite broadcast provider can receive a security ticker symbol and a security quote<br>
from an information provider that is to be transmitted to a user. This ini brmation can be general<br>
information or can be user-specific information (e.g., information taken directly from his or her<br>
trading account.) This information can be correlated by a broadcast provider to a particular satellite<br>
radio receiver through a unique identifier. For example, DELL $50.25 can be broadcast or<br>
transmitted to a specific XM Satellite receiver such that the authorized user who holds a position in<br>
Dell Computers can be informed of its current security quote. In some embodiments, the security<br>
quote that is broadcast can be a delayed quote (e.g., fifteen (15) minutes delayed) or, in other<br>
embodiments, the security quote can be in "real-time."<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
8<br>
[0020]      Likewise, other financial information can include a security position or the number of<br>
shares of a security that a user currently holds {e.g., "position") in their account. Accordingly, in<br>
some embodiments, the financial information transmitted to the receiver zan include "500 shares<br>
DELL." In embodiments that are particularly advantageous for a user with a current position in a<br>
company, the financial information that is broadcast can include a market value of the security<br>
position. In other words, if a user holds 500 shares of DELL, the last trade of which was $50.25, the<br>
market value of the security position that is broadcast to the receiver {e.g., user) can include<br>
"$25,125.00".<br>
[0021]       As such, in some embodiments, financial information can include a trade order, In<br>
operation, the user can operate the receiver to broadcast back to the financial information provider<br>
(e.g., Fidelity Investments) a order for "500 shares DELL" at market, for example. In some<br>
embodiments, a user can transmit a personal identification code ("PIN") to verify that the user has<br>
access to the financial account. This is particularly of interest for securi y reasons. In addition to<br>
the unique identifier attached to the user-information, a PIN code can aid in verifying the identity of<br>
the user for the financial information provider.<br>
[0022]      In other embodiments, financial information can include a trade confirmation. For<br>
example, a user can request a broker (e.g., a Fidelity advisor) to trade 500 shares of DELL security if<br>
the security reached $50.25 (i. e., a "limit" order). At any time when the DELL security hits $50.25,<br>
the information provider (in this case Fidelity) can relay the inforrnaiior. to the satellite broadcast<br>
provider. The satellite broadcast provider (e.g., Sinus Satellite Radio) can correlate the user-specific<br>
information with an identifier that is unique to a particular satellite receiver. Once broadcast, the<br>
authorized user (e.g., subscriber) of the satellite receiver can review the trade confirmation on the<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
9<br>
display of the satellite receiver or a display located on another device. In other embodiments, the<br>
receiver can provide the information audibly to a listener.<br>
[0023]       In other embodiments, financial information can include a trade recommendation from a<br>
Fidelity advisor, for example. Based upon the user (such as based upon :i pre-determined watch list<br>
of securities created by the user), recommendations can be relayed to the user through the network.<br>
Similarly, news alerts related to a certain security can be transmitted to the receiver of the authorized<br>
user. Also, an account alert can be transmitted. Various types of account alerts can be broadcast to<br>
the satellite receiver. For example, a user's account can be pre-set so the t if the account balance hits<br>
a certain level, a message is automatically forwarded to the user via the preferred network.<br>
Likewise, the brokerage company (e.g., Fidelity Investments) can broad
user's receiver. In some embodiments, an account balance for a user can be broadcast periodically<br>
(or on-demand) to the receiver. Without limitation, other types of user-specific information known<br>
to those in the art can be broadcast.<br>
[0024]       For any information (but of particular interest to important or time-sensitive<br>
information), the techniques enable a broadcast provider to transmit use;-specific information to a<br>
targeted user regardless of the particular signal, frequency or channel that the targeted user is then-<br>
currently receiving. For illustrative purposes, a "margin call" can be broadcast to the user (a Fidelity<br>
Investments account holder) even if the user is receiving a talk show or sports programming (a non-<br>
FIDELITY channel or signal) on his or her receiver, for example. As such, an information provider<br>
(through the broadcast provider) can "break in" to the receiver of a parti cular user regardless of the<br>
particular station or frequency the receiver is then-currently receiving.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
10<br>
[0025]       Examples also include the dissemination of general information to users through the<br>
network. For example, financial information can include general infomution that is not necessarily<br>
associated specifically with a user. For example, general information car. include each of the user-<br>
specific examples provided herein that may be transmitted regardless of whether the user has<br>
requested or has any interest in the particular financial quote, ticker symbol, a security price, a time<br>
of last trade, and news alert, for example.<br>
[0026]       The techniques described herein also can be used in business bperations, such as a livery<br>
service, for example. In embodiments involving a livery service, an information provider can<br>
include a livery business organization. The livery business organization can include a database<br>
server that is in communication with a network (e.g., a satellite radio ser/ice.) The database server<br>
retrievably stores user-specific information. In some embodiments, the user of a livery service can<br>
include, for example, a livery driver.<br>
[0027]      In such embodiments, the database server correlates the user-specific (i.e., driver-<br>
specific) information by matching the user-specific information with an identifier that is associated<br>
with a receiver, such as a satellite radio receiver. Also, these embodisne its can include broadcasting<br>
the user-specific information to the satellite radio receiver. The broadcast allows an authorized user<br>
(i. e., livery driver) of the satellite receiver to receive his or her user-spec ific information. Examples<br>
of user-specific information for a livery service includes a particular a p: ck-up location, a drop-off<br>
location, a time for the pick-up location, a passenger information and tb; like. Other information<br>
appropriate for a livery service is known to those in this business.<br>
[0028]       The techniques described herein also can be used to disseminate sports information to a<br>
satellite broadcast subscriber. On-line gaming and entertainment is a. burgeoning business. When<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
11<br>
wagering, accurate and timely information can help a user "beat" the odds. For example,<br>
information as to an injury to a star player can allow a user to make a wager based upon then-current<br>
odds that do not take this injury into account. Accordingly, the techniques include user-specific<br>
information that includes sports information.<br>
[0029]       In embodiments involving a gaming or entertainment operation, an information provider<br>
can include an on-line sports wagering business. The wagering business can include a database<br>
server that is in communication with a network (e.g., a digital radio service). The database server<br>
retrievably stores user-specific information. In some embodiments, a user of the on-line sports<br>
wagering business can include, for example, a customer.<br>
[0030]       In such embodiments, the database server can correlate the user-specmc information by<br>
matching the user-specific information with an identifier that is associated with a digital radio<br>
receiver, for example. Embodiments also can involve a network that is i. satellite radio service. The<br>
embodiments can also include broadcasting the user-specific information to the appropriate type of<br>
receiver. The broadcast allows an authorized user (i.e., customer) of the receiver to receive the user-<br>
specific information. Examples of user-specific information for an on-line sports wagering service<br>
includes, for example, a sports score, a sports odd, a sports over/under odds, a player performance<br>
information, a team performance information, an account balance, an amount of a wager, and other<br>
related wagering information. Other information appropriate for an on-line sports wagering<br>
business are known to those in this business.<br>
[0031]      The techniques described herein also can be used to inform t avelers of any travel<br>
advisories and other up-to-the-minute travel information that could save travelers time idling in<br>
traffic. For example, appropriate re-routing information can be disseminated to a user based upon,<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
12<br>
for example, the driver's past driving history. In these embodiments, an information provider can<br>
include a travel advisory organization. The travel advisory organization (such as a local television<br>
station) can include a database server that is in communication with a network. The database server<br>
is updated with current travel and traffic information which is retrievably stored along with user-<br>
specific information.<br>
[0032]       In such embodiments, the database server can correlate the user-specific information by<br>
matching the user-specific information with an identifier that is associated with a receiver, such as a<br>
satellite radio receiver. Also, embodiments can include broadcasting the user-specific information<br>
to the satellite radio receiver. The broadcast allows an authorized user (i e., traveler) of the satellite<br>
receiver to receive the user-specific information. Examples of user-spec: fie information beneficial<br>
for a traveler includes traffic information such as, for example, a traffic z dvisory, a traffic accident<br>
information, a traffic routing recommendation, a weather information, or a road condition<br>
information. Other information appropriate for traffic listeners are know n to those in this business.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0039]       FIG. 1 provides an exemplary system 100 for broadcasting ussr-specific information<br>
from an information provider 110. The system 100 includes the information provider 110, a<br>
network 115, a broadcast provider 120 and a receiver 130. In the financial services embodiment, as<br>
discussed herein, the information provider 110 can be a financial service 3 company such as Fidelity<br>
Investments. The information provider 110 transmits user-specific infor nation to a network 115,<br>
such as through a web-server. The transfer of user-specific information ;an be through any<br>
appropriate network.<br>
[0040]       The user-specific information contains an identifier that is unique to the user. The<br>
identifier can include any appropriate series of numbers and/or characters, or any other means that<br>
enables the information provider 110 to tag the user-specific information to a particular user. The<br>
user-specific information then is transmitted from the network 115 to a broadcast provider 120. One<br>
example of a broadcast provider 120 is a satellite broadcast provider. XM Satellite Radio and Sirius<br>
Satellite Radio are two examples of broadcast providers 120 that digital y transmit information to<br>
targeted subscribers. However, any broadcast providers that are capablf s of digitally transmitting<br>
information while discriminating between its users can be utilized. For example, digital radio or<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
14<br>
other broadcast channels {e.g., AM and FM frequencies) also can be used according to the<br>
techniques discussed in more detail herein.<br>
[0041]      The broadcast provider 120 correlates the user-specific inforniation tagged with the<br>
identifier to the appropriate user/receiver and then broadcasts the user-spocific information. A<br>
receiver 130 accepts the user-specific information that contains the uniquely tagged identifier and<br>
ignores all others. At the receiver 130, the user can have the option of listening to the user-specific<br>
information or having it displayed at the receiver 130 or any other appropriate console. For<br>
example, if the receiver 130 is located in an automobile, the user-specific information (in this case,<br>
financial information such as stock ticker symbol and stock quote) can be; displayed on a portion of<br>
the windshield using, for example, heads up display technology. In addition, any visual display or<br>
audio component that is capable of receiving and displaying and/or playing the user-specific<br>
information to the user can be included in the receiver 130.<br>
[0042]      As discussed herein, the broadcast provider 120 can transmit la plurality of user-specific<br>
information intended for different receivers 130 (or users) over a single signal or channel. A<br>
particular user can access his or her user-specific information that is broadcast over a particular<br>
channel by an identifier that is uniquely associated with his or her receiver 130, which is tagged to<br>
the user-specific information. A receiver 130 searches for the user-specific information that<br>
contains the uniquely tagged identifier. As such, different users can havs access to different user-<br>
specific information on the same broadcast channel or signal. In other words, during a broadcast;<br>
one user's information can be different from that of another user. To reject information not meant<br>
for the user associated with the receiver 130, encryption algorithms can nclude the use of the unique<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
15<br>
identifier for the receiver 130. Using such a technique ensures that the receiver 130 can only<br>
decipher information meant for that specific receiver 130.<br>
[0043]       The user also can transmit information from the receiver 130 ;o the broadcast provider<br>
120. The user-specific information can be tracked and maintained securely with the unique<br>
identifier associated with the receiver 130 and the user. In another embodiment, the receiver 130<br>
can transmit directly to the information provider 110 (e.g., using other wreless communication<br>
channels such as cellular, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.)<br>
[0044]       The user-specific information can be an order for securities (e .g., 500 shares of DELL at<br>
market price). If the broadcast provider 120 receives the order, the broadcast provider 120 can then<br>
transmit this user-specific information via the network 115, to the information provider (e.g.,<br>
Fidelity Investments) 110. Once the user-specific information (e.g., ordi ;r request) is accepted by<br>
the information provider 110, the order can be executed. Accordingly, after the trade is executed, a<br>
trade confirmation (i.e., user-specific information) can be communicated to the user, via the receiver<br>
130, through the network 115 and the broadcast provider 120, as described herein.<br>
[0045]       FIG. 2 provides another exemplary system 200 for broadcast: ng user-specific financial<br>
information from a financial information provider 205. The system 200 includes the financial<br>
information provider 205, a quotes engine 210, a user database 215, a financial information provider<br>
webserver 220, a WAN 225 (e.g., the Internet), a satellite broadcast prouder 230, a satellite<br>
broadcast provider webserver 235, a subscriber database 240, a satellite 245 and a receiver 250. A<br>
network of an exemplary system 200 described herein can include the Internet, company intranet,<br>
and satellite broadcast provider's communication channels.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
16<br>
[0046]       In. the financial services embodiment, the financial information provider 205 can be a<br>
financial services company such as Fidelity Investments. The financial information provider 205<br>
can transmit user-specific information intended to be sent to a particular user. In FIG. 2, quotes are<br>
transmitted from the quotes engine 210 to a user database 215. The quotes engine 210 is in<br>
communication with the user database 215, which includes an identifier tiat is unique to the<br>
financial services customer. The user database 215 is in communication with a financial<br>
information provider webserver 220. The quote (tagged with the identifier) is transmitted to the<br>
financial information provider webserver 220 securely via the Internet 225, The financial<br>
information webserver 220 also is in communication with the Internet 225.<br>
[0047]       The tagged quote is securely transmitted through the Internet 225 (e.g., using 128-bit<br>
cipher strength encryption) to the satellite broadcast provider 230. More specifically, the quote<br>
tagged with the user-specific identifier is transmitted to the satellite broadcast provider webserver<br>
235, which is in communication with the Internet 225. Once the quote is received by the satellite<br>
broadcast provider webserver 235, the quote is transmitted to the subscriber database 240. The<br>
subscriber database 240 is in communication with the satellite broadcast provider webserver 235.<br>
At the subscriber database 240, the quote (tagged with the unique identifier) is matched with the<br>
appropriate subscriber's receiver 250,<br>
[0048]       The quote (tagged with the unique identifier) then is transmitted from the subscriber<br>
database 240 to a satellite 245 for broadcasting. For example, a satellite broadcast provider 230 can<br>
broadcast the quote (tagged with the unique identifier) on a FIDELITY channel or signal. As<br>
discussed herein, more than one quote can be transmitted by the satellite broadcast provider 230.<br>
For example, a satellite broadcast provider 230, which can be XM Satellite Radio and Sirius<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
17<br>
Satellite Radio, broadcasts the information via satellite 245 to the appropiiate receiver 250. The<br>
subscriber database 240 and the satellite 245 are in communication wi'th each other. The appropriate<br>
receiver 250 only will accept the quote (e.g., user-specific information) ii the information contains<br>
the uniquely tagged identifier. As such, different quotes can be accessed by different users or<br>
receivers 250. At the receiver 250, the user can either listen to the quote or the quote can be<br>
displayed.<br>
[0049]       In another example, and as shown in FIG. 2, the user can transmit information from the<br>
receiver 250 to the financial information provider 205. In some embodir Tents, the receiver 250 can<br>
transmit the information directly to the financial information provider 205. For example, if a quote<br>
received by the user is acceptable, the user can manipulate the receiver 250 to transmit a purchase<br>
order, (e.g., 500 shares of MSFT) from the receiver 250 to the financial information provider 205.<br>
In some embodiments, a user also can transmit a personal identification code ("PIN") to verify that<br>
the user is authorized to access his or her financial account. This is particularly of interest for<br>
security purposes. In addition to the unique identifier attached to the user-information (i.e., order for<br>
500 shares of MSFT), a PIN code can aid in verifying the identity of the user for the benefit of a<br>
financial information provider. The PIN code also can be used in the encryption algorithm (e.g., a<br>
key) to ensure only the systems with knowledge of the PIN code will be able to decipher the<br>
transmitted information.<br>
[0050]       In some embodiments, the receiver 250 can transmit the purchase order to the satellite<br>
245, which directs the purchase order to the subscriber database 240. Tie purchase order is relayed<br>
to the satellite broadcast provider webserver 235, and further relayed through the Internet 225. The<br>
satellite 245 also can bypass the subscriber database 240 and relay the purchase order (or any other<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
18<br>
user-specific information) directly to the satellite broadcast provider webserver 235 for transmission<br>
to the Internet 225. The purchase order can arrive at the financial informs ition provider 205, or more<br>
specifically by the financial information provider webserver 220. Thereafter, the purchase order can<br>
be relayed to the user database 215, and can be directed to a broker 260 for order execution. After<br>
the order is executed, the financial information provider 205 can relay an order execution<br>
confirmation to the receiver 250 by way of the techniques described here n. In some embodiments,<br>
the financial information provider 205 can instruct the satellite broadcast provider 230 to "break-in"<br>
to the receiver 250 by transmitting the order execution confirmation, for example, to the receiver<br>
250 regardless of the particular station or channel that the receiver 250 is then-currently receiving.<br>
[0051]       In some examples, the financial information provider 205 can have multiple channels on<br>
which the provider 205 delivers information. For example, one channel ;an be a public channel that<br>
is available (e.g., not encrypted) for all subscribers of the satellite broadcast provider 230. Another<br>
channel can be limited to subscribers of the financial information provider 205 (such as a premium<br>
Fidelity Investments channel). Here, the encryption techniques can be the same as the ones the<br>
satellite broadcast provider 230 uses to enable premium channel selection and reception. Another<br>
channel can be a channel for delivering the user-specific information. In, other examples, where<br>
bandwidth allows, these three channels can be combined into a single channel.<br>
[0052]       FIG. 3 provides an exemplary network 300 for broadcasting user-specific information<br>
from a livery information provider 310 using a high-definition radio 1rar smission. The network 3 00<br>
includes the livery information provider 310, an interface 320, a digital radio broadcast provider<br>
330, a broadcast tower 340 and a plurality of receivers 350A, 350B and 350C. In the livery services<br>
embodiment, the livery information provider 310 can be a service company such as Boston Coach.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
19<br>
The livery information provider 310 transmits user-specific information through an interface 320,<br>
such as through a web-server. As described herein, user-specific information can be, for example, a<br>
pick-up location, a drop-off location, a time for the pick-up location, passenger information, or any<br>
other information appropriate for a livery service.<br>
[0053]       The user-specific information contains an identifier that is unique to the driver of a<br>
livery, for example. The user-specific information is transmitted from ths interface 320 to a digital<br>
radio broadcast provider 330. High-definition digital radio offers CD-quality sound on the FM band<br>
and brings FM stereo-quality to the AM band. For example, radio stations bundles a digital HD<br>
radio signal, which include digital binary numbers and a traditional analc g wave-form, to a<br>
broadcast tower 340. At the broadcast tower 340, the digital signal is compressed and the combined<br>
signals are broadcast over the frequency assigned to the station. In one embodiment, the traditional<br>
AM/FM receivers still get the analog signal, while those with high-defin.tion receivers decode the<br>
digital signal. One advantage of high-definition digital radio over conventional radio is that the high<br>
definition receivers can receive digital information (e.g., user mformEition) on a display, for<br>
example.<br>
[0054]       The digital radio broadcast provider 330 correlates the user-s pecific information with an<br>
identifier so that the appropriate receiver has access to the information. The digital radio provider<br>
330 can broadcast the user-specific information (appropriately tagged w ;th the unique identifier)<br>
through the broadcast tower 340. The appropriate receiver, such as one of receivers 350A, 350B or<br>
350C, accepts the user-specific information that contains the uniquely tagged identifier. At the<br>
appropriate receiver 350A, 350B or 350C, the user can have the option of listening to the user-<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
20<br>
specific information or having the user-specific information displayed. Ir. some embodiments, the<br>
identifier can act as the key for decrypting or de-multiplexing the signal.<br>
[0055]      Likewise, the user can also transmit information from the recever 350A, 350B, or 350C<br>
to the digital radio broadcast provider 330. The user-specific information can be tracked and<br>
maintained securely with the unique identifier associated with the receiver 350A, 350B or 350C and<br>
the user. The digital radio broadcast provider 330 can receive the user-specific information and<br>
forward the information through the interface 320 to the livery information provider 310.<br>
[0056]      FIG. 4 provides an exemplary satellite receiver 400 for use in receiving and transmitting<br>
user-specific information. The satellite receiver 400 can be equipped or programmed to allow a user<br>
to transmit information from the receiver 400 back to the satellite broadc ist provider (e.g., provider<br>
230) or to the information provider (e.g., provider 205). In this example, a satellite receiver 400<br>
includes a housing 410, a display 420, a turn dial 430, and a plurality of buttons 440. One advantage<br>
of this embodiment of the satellite receiver 400 is that these components typically exist on many<br>
satellite receivers. As such, no special features need to be added to the physical make-up of the<br>
receiver 400 to provide functionality to the satellite receiver 400 in ordei for information to be<br>
transmitted.<br>
[0057]      The following is exemplary functionality for a satellite recerv er 400 (or any other<br>
appropriate receiver, such as a digital radio receiver) that uses each of the hardware components<br>
already typically found on the device. For example, the display 420 is already designed to receive<br>
digital information that is broadcast by the satellite broadcast provider.  Most receivers 400<br>
generally have a turn dial 430 that, depending on the model, can change the frequency received by<br>
the user or adjust the audio volume of the broadcast. The turn dial 430, however can also be used to<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046S59<br>
21<br>
go forwards or backwards through the alphabet by turning the turn dial 42 0 to the right or left. For<br>
example, taming the turn dial 430 to the right can advance a letter from A to B to C3 and so on.<br>
Manipulating the turn dial 430 can change the letter from C to B back to A, for example. Similarly,<br>
the turn dial can be used to change a numeral from 0 to 9, for example. As such, a user can transmit<br>
any alphanumeric information to the intended recipient (e.g., information provider or broadcast<br>
provider), such as, for example, a PIN code, a financial order request, a location for pick-up, a sports<br>
wager, and so on.<br>
[0058]      In addition, the receiver 400 can include a plurality of buttons 440. In some<br>
embodiments, the buttons can represent pre-programmed stations. In other embodiments, two of the<br>
buttons can also be used to function like a turn dial, one button advancing through the alphabet (or<br>
number), and another button acting to go backwards through the alphabet (or number). Pressing one<br>
of the buttons can also serve to move to the next letter or number. In other embodiments, pressing<br>
one of the buttons can serve to act as a "SEND" signal to transmit the information from the receiver<br>
400 to the broadcast provider. In some embodiments, however, the rece: ver 400 can bypass the<br>
broadcast provider and transmit the information directly to the information provider, such as a<br>
financial services company (e.g., Fidelity Investments).<br>
[0059]       FIG. 5 provides an exemplary flow diagram 500 for a process of broadcasting user-<br>
specific information to a receiver, such as broadcasting financial information via a satellite broadcast<br>
provider. Generally, user-specific information is provided 510 from an: nformation provider<br>
comprising a first database server in communication with a network. The first database server<br>
retrievably stores the user-specific information. The user-specific information received from the<br>
information provider is correlated with a second database server of a satellite broadcast provider.<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
22<br>
The user-specific information is matched 520 with an identifier associated with a satellite receiver.<br>
The user-specific information is broadcast 530 to the satellite receiver. The broadcast allows an<br>
authorized user of said satellite receiver to access said user-specific information.<br>
[0060]      The above-described systems and methods can be implemented, in whole or in part, in<br>
digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of<br>
them. The implementation can be as a computer program product, i.e., a computer program tangibly<br>
embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage d ;vice or in a propagated<br>
signal, for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a<br>
programmable processor, a computer, or multiple computers. A computer program can be written in<br>
any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be<br>
deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a modulo, component, subroutine, or<br>
other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer projiram can be deployed to be<br>
executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites<br>
,and interconnected by a network.<br>
[0061]       Method steps can be performed by one or more programrnabj e processors executing a<br>
computer program to perform functions of the invention by operating, on input data and generating<br>
output. Method steps can also be performed by, and apparatus can be implemented as, special<br>
purpose logic circuitry, e.g., an FPGA (field programmable gate array) or an ASIC<br>
(application-specific integrated circuit). Modules can refer to portions cf the computer program<br>
and/or the processor/special circuitry that implements that functionality.<br>
[0062]       Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example,<br>
both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
23<br>
digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory<br>
or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for<br>
executing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally,<br>
a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data, from or transfer data to, or<br>
both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto-optical disks, or<br>
optical disks. Some data transmission and instructions can also occur ov zr a network. Information<br>
carriers suitable for embodying computer program instructions and data include all forms of non-<br>
volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memoiy 6 evices, e.g., EPROM,<br>
EEPROM, and flash memory devices; magnetic disks, e.g., internal hard disks or removable disks;<br>
magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. The proces sor and the memory can be<br>
supplemented by, or incorporated in special purpose logic circuitry.<br>
[0063]       To provide for interaction with a user, the above described techniques can be<br>
implemented on a receiver having a display device, e.g., a CRT (cathode ray tube) or LCD (liquid<br>
crystal display), for displaying information to the user. Other kinds of devices can be used to<br>
provide for interaction with a user as well; for example, feedback provided to the user can be any<br>
form of sensory feedback, e.g., visual feedback, auditory feedback, or tactile feedback; and input<br>
from the user can be received in any form, including acoustic, speech, or tactile input.<br>
[0064]       The above described techniques can be implemented in a distributed computing system<br>
that includes a back-end component, e.g., as a data server, and/or a middleware component, e.g., an<br>
application server, and/or a front-end component, e.g., a client computei having a graphical user<br>
interface and/or a Web browser through which a user can interact with an example implementation,<br>
or any combination of such back-end, middleware, or front-end components. The components of<br><br>
WO 2006/069230	PCT/US2005/046559<br>
24<br>
the system can be interconnected by any form or medium of digital data communication, e.g., a<br>
communication network. Examples of networks include a local area network ("LAN") and a wide<br>
area network ("WAN"), e.g., the Internet, and include both wired and wireless networks.<br>
[0065]      The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally<br>
remote from each other and typically interact through a network. The relationship of client and<br>
server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a<br>
client-server relationship to each other.<br>
[0066]       The invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments. The alternatives<br>
described herein are examples for illustration only and not to limit the alternatives in any way. The<br>
steps of the invention can be performed in a different order and still achieve desirable results. Other<br>
embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
