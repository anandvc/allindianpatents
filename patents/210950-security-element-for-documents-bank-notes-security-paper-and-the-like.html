COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10, Rule 13]<br>
SECURITY ELEMENT FOR DOCUMENTS, BANK NOTES, SECURITY PAPER AND THE LIKE;<br>
FABRIANO SECURITIES S.R.L., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF ITALY, WHOSE ADDRESS IS VIA MILANO, 71, 20021 BOLLATE (MILANO), ITALY.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a. security element for documents, oank notes, security paper and the like.<br>
As is known, security elements for documents, bank notes, security paper and the like have been produced by using threads which, generally speaking, are constituted by a substrate made of clear plastic on which metallic layers, magnetic layers, microprinted layers, fluorescent layers,- magnetic; codes" combined with metallization techniques and so forth have been applied, so as to provide the most disparate kinds of security element.<br>
The threads thus provided are inserted in the paper fully-or partially, in that the thread protrudes on the surface of the paper at discrete .portions-and is fully embedded in the paper in the remaining portions.<br>
The current trend has been to provide security elements that would allow the public to perform easy and  straightforward verification, and for this purpose threads have been provided in which demeta"llized regions were provided on. the metallized layer and could, for example, form lettering or the like, so as to allow the public to check the lettering; said" threads,, provided by means of a metallic surface that can also be of tie--high-reflectance .type, have the characteristic that once inserted in the. document they are not visible under reflected light but are visible when held up to the light, i.e.,.by placing the document between a light source and. the person who must perform the verification.<br>
However, these kinds of solution .have several drawbacks,- the first one being the.fact that the threads currendy used allow lettering or characters that are approximately 0,8 mm high- and are therefore not easily visible to" users.<br>
The aim of the invention is to .solve the problems noted above by providing a security element for documents, bank- notes, security paper and<br><br>
the like that allows to provide the user, i.e., the public,, with the-possibility to" immediately perceive the presence of the security element in the.document together with a. criterion that allows to assess its authenticity.<br>
Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of the invention is to provide a security element that allows to use various combinations of methods that are already, commercially, available, obtaining a particular combination of effects.<br>
Another object of fee present invention is to provide a security element that by virtue of its particular constructive characteristics is capable of giving the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in use. .<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a security element for documents, bank notes, security paper and-the like that can be .obtained easily starting  from commonly commercially available; elements and materials and is furthermore competitive from a purely economic standpoint. This aim, these objects and others that will become better" apparent hereinafter are achieved by a security element" for document"s, bank notes, security paper and the like, according to the invention, characterized in that -it comprises a continuous supporting layer on" which there is at least one metallized layer that forms at. least one high-feflectanee;.region that is flanked, on at least one face, by at least one low-reflectance region in order to have, when the"security element is- at least partially inserted"m a document and the like, a different dimensional .perception of the" security element when viewed under reflected light and when viewed against:the light. •<br>
Further characteristics and advantages will "become apparent from the description of a preferred but not exclusive embodiment of a security element for documents, bank notes, security paper" and the/like; illustrated only by way of non-limitative example with the aid of the"accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>

With reference to the cited figures, the security element for documents, bank notes, security paper and the like, according -to the" invention, is provided so" as to be able to perceive immediately its presence inside a document, without thereby requiring particular visual acuity.<br>
In particular, the security element according to the- invention, once inserted in a document, bank note, security card or-the.like has thepaiticular characteristic of providing a different dimensional perception when viewed under reflected light and when viewed against the light.   <br>
Considering the first embodiment, shown in Figures 3 and 4, a security. element, generally designated by the reference numeral I, is provided which has a supporting layer 2 that is-advantageously formed by a thread or ribbon<br><br>
of plastic such as polyester, polypropylene, polycarbonate- and. the like and advantageously but not necessarily has a thickness between 3 and-200 µm, preferably between 15 and 23 p.m. The security element thus provided is preset to be inserted in the paper both according to. the method" mat-provides for foil insertion in the paper and according to the method that provides for insertion by segments" or windows. A metallized layer 3- is.provided on the supporting layer 2, can be made of various materials and has the-particularity of having a high reflectance, which is preferably greater thati, or. equal to, 1.2 Optical Density.<br>
Said high-reflectance metallized layer can be obtained. .by means of various materials, such as- aluminum, chromium, nickel or other metals or combinations of metals or by deposition of alloys.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, on both faces of the metallized layer 3, . which in practice forms a high-reflectance region,, there is a low-reflectance region that is advantageously constituted" by a layer of .print" 4 applied by rotogravure, screen printing, offset printing or the like or by deposition and -.. transfer of ribbons, lacquers, or in any case any method capable of providing a region that has a different reflectance and more specifically a certain. degree"of opacity capable of absorbing light rays.  <br>
The layers 4 can be provided on both faces of the metallized-layer or optionally on a single face.<br>
The assembly is furthermore completed by providing .a hot-rnelt.adhesive layer 6, which facilitates the anchoring of the security-element when it is inserted in the.paper of the document and the like.<br>
In"the specific case, the printed layer affects the central region, while the" metallized layer forms two high-reflectance regions at the longitudinal edges. -of the supporting layer.<br>
With this type of security element, when using a security element that"has a supporting layer for example 4mm .wide, it is possible to. provide a central printed region of 2 mm, which in. practice delimits two bigh-refletance<br><br><br>
bands of 1 mm at each edge.<br>
By inserting this security element in the document, under reflected light the user easily perceives the presence of an element whose .width-is defined by the printed region, i.e., by the central low-reflectance or "high-opacity region.<br>
When viewing the document against the light, instead, one lias a completely different dimensional perception, since the "thread appears with its full-width, which in"the specific example is 4 mm.<br>
By providing the printed layer on only-one face, it is possible to have on<br>
one face a variation in dimensional perception under reflected light and<br>
against me light and to not see, on the opposite face, under reflected light,<br>
"       "	r<br>
the presence of the ribbon, which is instead visible against the light. .<br>
With reference to Figures 5 and 6, it is possible, to provide a security element, generally designated by the reference numeral 10/ which, has a supporting layer 11 again made of plastic, of the optically transparent type,, on which there is a metallized, layer. 12 that is subjected centrally or in another area thereof to demetallization, so as to produce-a region that can be affected by the printing 13, so that it is possible to obtain the high-reflectance region at the metallized layer that remains after demetallization and the low-reflectance region at the printed region.<br>
In the printed region it is.possible to provide characters, distinctive markings or the like 15, obtained in negative form, so that in addition to" having a dimensional difference under reflected light and- against the. light, as in the preceding case, it is possible to have lettering revealed!.<br>
The lettering can also be provided on a continuous metallized layer, so that they are visible in reflected light, and these applications can be provided on one face or on both faces.<br>
It should be added to the above that in order to provide banded regions or the like with the presence of metal, for. example alternated with printed regions, it is possible to use various known technologies, such as selective<br><br>
metallization with banded selective deposition by using spsciahmti-adhesion<br>
oils or by means of selective masks, or to provide the longitudinal, bands -.<br>
where printing is provided by demetallization of a preceding metallization<br>
layer that is protected in the regions where it must persist by .virtue Of the<br>
deposition of protective lacquers "that, cannot be attacked by the acids used<br>
for demetallization.<br>
As is evident, it is possible to perform a whole range of combinations of<br>
elements always by utilizing the adjacent arrangement of a high-jeflectanqe<br>
region and of a low-reflectance region, thus obtaining perceptual variations.<br>
between the viewing of the document that contains.the securty element<br>
under reflected light and against the light<br>
The security elements described above are preferably used fully inserted<br>
in the document.<br>
If one uses the method.of insertion by segments;- it is possible to increase<br>
the security criteria by .using a thread for example of the "type-shown in<br>
Figures 7 and 8.<br>
In this case, the thread, generally designated by the reference numeral 20,<br>
is provided with a supporting layer 21 on which"there is a high-reflectance<br>
region provided by metallized layers 21 made of various kinds of metal, on<br>
which a holographic lacquer 23 is applied. In tm^rnarmeritis possible to<br>
combine the perception of the different dimensions for. the portion that<br>
remains inserted in the document with a holographic viewing of the portions<br>
that remain externally.<br>
It is optionally possible to provide,-on the-printed regiqnthat constitutes<br>
the low-reflectance region,  designated by- the reference-.numeral 24,<br>
characters 25 in negative form. "<br>
Advantageously, there is a protective layer .2.6 made of. plastic, which<br>
protects the holographically treated surface.<br>
Furthermore, the holographic surfaces, constituted for example by two<br>
bands, can be provided in mutually different manners.<br><br>
It is also possible to apply to the metallised regions 22 a sequence of-materials such as alurxiinuni, magnesium sulfide and chromium. which when struck by light emit most colors between 400 and 800 nanometers in- the visual spectrum while maintaining a very high degree of.reflectance; m-this manner it is possible to provide a security element that allows-to provide a. variety of elements that are easy to interpret and can -allow to identify the validity of the document in which the thread is inserted.<br>
It should be added to the above. that in order to vary the - color characteristics it is possible- to- provide a. layer, of fluorescent or phosphorescent or iridescent material.<br>
For the sake of completeness in description, it should also be added-that on the security element 20 there are the usual" adhesive and -hot melt adhesive layers for connection, and embedding, generally designated by the" reference numeral 27.<br>
According to what is shown in Figures 9 to 11, a security element, generally designated by the reference numeral 30, is"provided which has a supporting layer 31 provided with metallized- bands or portions 32, optionally covered by holographic lacquer 33, which are arranged externally with respect to a low-reflectance printed region 35.<br>
The printed region, if evaluated in a. longitudinal; direction, has advantageously an alternation of markings and characters-36 that are visible in negative form, with regions affected by magnetic elements-37 that are protected by a covering layer 38 on the face that lies opposite the-one provided with the printed layer, which allow to provide" a code that can .be detected by a machine.<br>
In this manner it is therefore possible to have, in the low-reflectance region, graphic markings that are visible in negative-form arid-are alternated with regions where a magnetic code is provided.<br>
With the solutions described above, which can be combined in various manners, a thread or ribbon 4 mm wide, which has from the edge a region of<br><br>
1 mm of high-reflectance material and at the center a 2-mm region with" low reflectance and negative letters., has on the other .edge 1 mm of high-reflectance material.<br>
In these conditions, if the bank note is viewed in reflected -light, on both faces one notices the presence of a thread that is 2 mm wide; people with excellent eyesight might also detect the graphic rum-kings or texts provided in me low-reflectance region.<br>
By transferring the bank note or document from reflected, light, to backlit<br>
conditions, the dimensional difference become immediately evident, since<br>
the width changes from 2 to 4 mm and moreover the graphic markings or<br>
texts are particularly evident.	<br>
If the thread is inserted in the .paper with the" technique of insertion by segments, one has regions where the thread is fully inserted and regions in which the thread is on the outer face of the document<br>
By viewing the bank note in reflected light, on the face where the thread, is fully covered one notices the presence of a thread that is 2 mm wide; when the bank note is viewed on the other face, where the thread, is:inserted by segments, between full" insertion and non-insertion, one can see a 2-mm thread when it is covered by the paper, i.e., inserted, and a 4:mrii thread when it is not covered by the paper or not inserted; in these positions one can see all the effects produced by any optional holographic method or other color changing method."<br>
By moving the bank note from reflected light to backlit conditions and viewing the face in which the thread is fully inserted, one.; experiences a width variation from 2 to 4 mm, while by viewing the thread-on the opposite face one sees an image.with the same width but with an alternation of color-effects in register, following the pattern of the thread, which is covered of exposed.<br>
In the execution of the tliread it is preferable to use a supporting layer with a thickness of 15 to 23µm, on which the metallized layer, preferably<br><br>
aluminum, is deposited and is applied selectively or demetallised in the regions where the printed layer is provided.<br>
The aliiminmn is then printed, if the hologram is present, with a holographic lacquer and conventional embossing is performed. Then the central region is printed by virtue of a known method. It is optionally also possible, to print immediately the holographic lacquer onto clear polyester, emboss it and then proceed with the step for selective metallization or demetallization by virtue of a known method;" then the central region is printed as described earlier-It is thus evident from what has been described above that the invention . achieves the intended aim and- objects, and in particular the fact is stressed" that a security element for documents, bank notes, security paper and the like is provided which is extremely versatile and allows to provide a new kind of security document that provides a perceivable dimensional;variatidnbetween reflected light and backlit conditions.<br>
It should be added to the above that in the examples of embodiment provided, the individual characteristics presented in relatioa.to specific examples may actually be interchanged with other different characteristics that occur in other examples of embodiment.<br>
Moreover, it is noted that anything found to be already known during the patenting process is understood not to be claimed and to be deleted from the claims.<br>
The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of flic inventive concept.<br>
AD the details may frirthennore be replaced with various..technically equivalent elements.<br>
In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the specific use, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions; may be any according to the requirements and the state of the art.: .<br><br>
In particular; the low-reflectance region of the security element according to the present invention may comprise an ink. Preferably, the low-reflectance region comprises a non-metallic ink.<br>
The invention can be modified in that the aluminium is printed, if the hologram is present, by a casting process instead of the embossing process.<br>
Instead of aluminium, a noble metal, aluminium, chromium, copper, nickel or a combination thereof can be used. Preferably, the noble metal is gold.<br>
At said low-reflectance region, graphic markings can be printed not only<br>
in negative form, but they can also be printed in positive form or in both<br>
