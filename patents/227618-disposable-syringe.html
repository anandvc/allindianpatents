				<td>DISPOSABLE SYRINGE<br>
This invention relates to a disposable syringe, more<br>
particularly to a disposable syringe which enables a needle<br>
cannula to be retracted within a plunger cavity having a reduced<br>
pressure therein.<br>
Referring to Pigs. 1 and 2, a hypodermic injection syringe<br>
10 which includes a barrel 11, a base 12 fixed to an open front<br>
end 111 of the barrel 11, a needle cannula 13 having a rear needle<br>
end 132 that extends into the barrel 11 through the base 12 along<br>
an axis and that has an engagement recess 131, and a plunger<br>
18 slidable within the barrel 11. The plunger 18 includes a<br>
hollow shaft 14 with a vacuum chamber 141, and a head which has<br>
an elastic rubber ring 16 with a channel that is closed by a<br>
disc 161, and a plug 15 with a tube forcibly inserted into the<br>
channel of the ring 16 and secured to the shaft 14. A piston<br>
17 is slidable in a sealed manner within the chamber 141, and<br>
is provided with an engaging rod 172 formed with an elastic flap<br>
171 on a front end thereof.<br>
In use, when the plunger 18 is about to finish its injection<br>
stroke, the disc 161 is lacerated by the rear needle end 132,<br>
the rod 172 then engages the needle 13 by engagement of the flap<br>
171 and the engagement recess 131. In this state, under the<br>
action of vacuum present in the chamber 141, the rod 172 and<br>
the needle 13 are sucked into the chamber 141.<br>
Since the needle 13 can be retained in the chamber 141 of<br>
the plunger 18 for safety disposal, the following drawbacks<br>
arise:<br><br>
1.	The laceration of the disc 161 may occur when the injection<br>
procedure of the syringe 10 is not finished. Thus, some medicine<br>
or blood may will remain within the barrel 11 to result in<br>
contamination.<br>
2.	In order to smoothly suck the needle 13 into the chamber<br>
141, the securing of the needle 13 to the base 12 cannot be very<br>
tight. However, insufficient securing of the needle 13 will<br>
result in movement or removal of the needle 13 during the<br>
injection procedure.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
disposable syringe which can prevent trapping of medicine or<br>
blood therein after injection and which can be operated easily<br>
and smoothly to retract a used needle within a plunger.<br>
According to this invention, the disposable syringe includes<br>
a needle cannula, a barrel, a tubular barrier member, a tubular<br>
needle seat, and a plunger. The barrel has an inner surrounding<br>
barrel wall surface surrounding an axis and confining a passage<br>
with opposite rearward and forward openings. The inner<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface includes a larger-diameter<br>
segment and a smaller-diameter segment which confine rear and<br>
front passageways, respectively, to form a surrounding shoulder<br>
portion therebetween. The smaller-diameter segment includes a<br>
smaller front surrounding region and a larger rear surrounding<br>
region to form a surrounding abutment wall therebetween. The<br>
larger-diameter segment includes proximate and distal<br>
surrounding regions respectively proximate to and distal from<br>
the surrounding shoulder portion. The proximate surrounding<br><br>
region has a retaining area spaced apart from the surrounding<br>
shoulder portion.<br>
The tubular barrier member includes front and rear<br>
surrounding edge portions, and inner and outer barrier wall<br>
surfaces. The outer barrier wall surface is retained at the<br>
retaining area by virtue of a first frictional force generated<br>
therebetween while in water-tight engagement with the proximate<br>
surrounding region, thereby partitioning the rear passageway<br>
into a compressible chamber confronting the surrounding<br>
shoulder portion, and an accommodation chamber confronting the<br>
rear surrounding edge portion. The inner barrier wall surface<br>
has a grip segment.<br>
The tubular needle seat includes a hub portion disposed to<br>
fix the needle cannula therein. The hub portion has a surrounding<br>
front end wall, a surrounding gripped portion and an anchoring<br>
portion. The surrounding gripped portion is retained at the grip<br>
segment by virtue of a second frictional force generated<br>
therebetween when the surrounding front end wall abuts against<br>
the surrounding abutment wall and when the needle cannula is<br>
disposed outwardly of the forward opening.<br>
The plunger is movable in the accommodation chamber, and<br>
includes a plunger body and a seal member. The plunger body<br>
includes a top end wall disposed movably to abut against the<br>
rear surrounding edge portion of the tubular barrier member,<br>
and a bottom end wall extending outwardly of the rearward opening<br>
so as to be manually operable. The top end wall has an inner<br>
peripheral edge portion surrounding the axis to define a cavity<br><br>
therein. The cavity extends along the axis and towards the bottom<br>
end wall to contain a fluid at a reduced pressure. The seal member<br>
is disposed to be sealingly attached to the inner peripheral<br>
edge portion along a sealing line so as to trap the fluid in<br>
the cavity.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater detail,<br>
it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3, 4 and 5, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to the present invention<br>
is shown to comprise a barrel 20, a tubular barrier member 30,<br>
a plunger 50, and a needle assembly 40 including a needle cannula<br>
42, a tubular needle seat 41 and a tip protector 43.<br>
The barrel 20 has an inner surrounding barrel wall surface<br>
which surrounds an axis (X) and which confines a passage. The<br>
passage has rearward and forward openings 232,231 which are<br>
disposed opposite to each other in a longitudinal direction<br>
parallel to the axis (X). The inner surrounding barrel wall<br>
surface includes a larger-diameter segment 22 and a<br>
smaller-diameter segment 21 which confine rear and front<br>
passageways 221,210, respectively, and which are disposed<br>
proximate to the rearward and forward openings 232,231,<br>
respectively, to form a surrounding shoulder portion 222<br>
therebetween. The smaller-diameter segment 21 includes a front<br>
surrounding region 211, and a rear surrounding region 212 which<br>
is proximate to the surrounding shoulder portion 222 and which<br>
is of a larger dimension than that of the front surrounding<br>
region 211 so as to form a surrounding abutment wall 213<br>
therebetween. The larger-diameter segment 22 includes<br>
proximate and distal surrounding regions opposite to each other<br>
in the longitudinal direction and respectively proximate to and<br><br>
distal from the surrounding shoulder portion 222 . The proximate<br>
surrounding region has a retaining area which is spaced apart<br>
from the surrounding shoulder portion 222 in the longitudinal<br>
direction. In this embodiment, an annular first retaining<br>
protrusion 24 is formed on the proximate surrounding region in<br>
the retaining area. An annular injection limiting protrusion<br>
25	is formed on the distal surrounding region adjacent to the<br>
rearward opening 232. An outer surrounding barrel wall surface<br>
23 of the barrel 20 has a rib portion 235 which extends in the<br>
longitudinal direction and which is disposed at the front<br>
surrounding region 211 adjacent to the forward opening 231.<br>
The tubular barrier member 30 includes front and rear<br>
surrounding edge portions 33,34 opposite to each other in the<br>
longitudinal direction and which includes inner and outer<br>
barrier wall surfaces 31,35 opposite to each other and<br>
surrounding the axis (X) . The outer barrier wall surface 35 is<br>
formed with an annular first retaining groove 350 such that in<br>
a position of use, the first retaining protrusion 24 is retained<br>
in the first retaining groove 350 in a water-tight manner so<br>
as to generate a first frictional force therebetween, thereby<br>
partitioning the rear passageway 221 into a compressible chamber<br>
26	which confronts the surrounding shoulder portion 222, and<br>
an accommodation chamber 27 which confronts the rear surrounding<br>
edge portion 34. The inner barrier wall surface 31 has a second<br>
retaining groove 320 which serves as a grip segment. As shown<br>
in Fig. 5, the front surrounding edge portion 33 has a<br>
surrounding groove 39 surrounding the axis (X) such that the<br><br>
inner barrier wall surface 31 is more deformable in radial<br>
directions relative to the axis (X). In addition, the inner<br>
barrier wall surface 31 is divergent from the second retaining<br>
groove 320 to the front surrounding edge portion 33 so as to<br>
prevent friction contact between the inner barrier wall surface<br>
31 and the hub portion 410.<br>
The tubular needle seat 41 includes a hub portion 410 which<br>
is disposed to fix the needle cannula 42 therein, and which has<br>
a surrounding front end wall 411 that extends radially relative<br>
to the axis (X). An annular second retaining protrusion 414<br>
extends from the hub portion 410 in the longitudinal direction<br>
and away from the surrounding front end wall 411 to form a<br>
surrounding gripped portion, which is retained in the second<br>
retaining groove 320 to generate a second frictional force when<br>
the surrounding front end wall 411 abuts against the surrounding<br>
abutment wall 213 and when the needle cannula 42 is disposed<br>
outwardly of the forward opening 231. An anchoring portion 412<br>
extends from the second retaining protrusion 414 in the<br>
longitudinal direction and away from the hub portion 410, and<br>
has an annular third retaining protrusion 415 formed thereon<br>
(see Fig. 5).<br>
The tip protector 43 has a sleeve end 433 which is disposed<br>
to sleeve on the outer surrounding barrel wall surface 23. The<br>
sleeve end 433 includes a groove portion which mates with the<br>
rib portion 235 to result in a splined engagement between the<br>
tip protector 43 and the outer surrounding barrel wall surface<br>
23, thereby ensuring secure shielding of the needle cannula 42.<br><br>
Moreover, as the sleeve end 433 of the tip protector 43 is<br>
provided with the groove portion to engage the rib portion 235<br>
on the outer surrounding barrel wall surface 23, the sleeve end<br>
433 has a relatively large inner diameter, thereby enhancing<br>
safety during sleeving of the tip protector 43 onto the outer<br>
surrounding barrel wall surface 23.<br>
The plunger 50 is disposed to be slidable in the<br>
accommodation chamber 27, and includes a plunger body 54, an<br>
end cap 57, and a seal member 56.<br>
The plunger body 54 includes an open top end wall 541 which<br>
is disposed movably to abut against the rear surrounding edge<br>
portion 34 of the tubular barrier member 30, and an open bottom<br>
end wall 542 which is disposed opposite to the top end wall 541<br>
in the longitudinal direction and which extends outwardly of<br>
the rearward opening 232. The plunger body 54 has an inner<br>
peripheral edge portion 543 which surrounds the axis (X) and<br>
which defines a cavity 500 therein. The cavity 500 extends along<br>
the axis (X) from the top end wall 541 to the bottom end wall<br>
542 to contain a fluid at a reduced pressure. Preferably, the<br>
cavity 500 is in a substantially vacuum state. In this embodiment,<br>
the cavity 500 includes a smaller-diameter front cavity segment<br>
51 and a larger-diameter rear cavity segment 52 which are<br>
disposed proximate to the top and bottom end walls 541,542,<br>
respectively, to form a shoulder portion 55 therebetween.<br>
Preferably, an enlarged cavity segment 53 is disposed rearwardly<br>
of the rear cavity segment 52 and outwardly of the rearward<br>
opening 232 so as to be manually operable. A plurality of rib<br><br>
plates 549 are formed on an outer peripheral wall surface 544<br>
of the plunger body 54 at the front cavity segment 51, and are<br>
flush with the outer peripheral wall surface 544 at the rear<br>
cavity segment 52 . An annular injection limiting protrusion 545<br>
is formed on the outer peripheral wall surface 544 at the rear<br>
cavity segment 52 adjacent to the enlarged cavity segment 53,<br>
and is disposed to abut against the injection limiting<br>
protrusion 25 when the top end wall 541 reaches the rear<br>
surrounding edge portion 34 so as to indicate completion of an<br>
injection course.<br>
Moreover, an annular anchoring protrusion 546 and an annular<br>
retaining flange 547 are formed adjacent to the top end wall<br>
541. A surrounding sealing ring 59 is made of a deformable<br>
material, and is sleeved retainingly over the outer peripheral<br>
wall surface 544 adjacent to the top end wall 541 by means of<br>
the anchoring protrusion 546 and the retaining flange 547.<br>
The end cap 57 includes an outer surrounding wall 571 which<br>
engages threadedly a threaded segment 548 of the outer<br>
peripheral wall surface 544, an inner surrounding wall 572 which<br>
is attached to the inner peripheral edge portion 543, and an<br>
end cap wall 573 which is connected to the outer and inner<br>
surrounding walls 571,572 and which covers an opening in the<br>
bottom end wall 542 in an air-tight sealing manner.<br>
A plurality of barrier ribs 58 are formed between the rear<br>
cavity segment 52 and the enlarged cavity segment 53. Each<br>
barrier rib 58 extends from the inner peripheral edge portion<br>
543 radially and toward the axis (X).<br><br>
The seal member 56 is disposed to be sealingly attached to<br>
the inner peripheral edge portion 543 at the top end wall 541<br>
along an annular sealing line 566 so as to trap the fluid in<br>
the cavity 500 so as to maintain the reduced pressure (the<br>
substantially vacuum state in this embodiment). In the<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the seal member 56 is formed on the<br>
inner peripheral edge portion 543. Alternately, referring to<br>
Fig. 21, the seal member 56 is disposed to be press-fitted to<br>
the inner peripheral edge portion 543 so as to form a sealing<br>
region. The seal member 56 has an engaging recess 563 which<br>
confronts the anchoring portion 412 and which extends in the<br>
longitudinal direction, and a third retaining groove 565 which<br>
is disposed in a front side of the engaging recess 563 and which<br>
extends in a radial direction relative to the axis (X) , as shown<br>
in Fig. 5.<br>
In use, the plunger 50 is pressed forwardly by a pushing<br>
force applied to the end cap 57 to push the surrounding sealing<br>
ring 59 to reach the rear surrounding edge portion 34 until the<br>
injection limiting protrusion 545 abuts against the injection<br>
limiting protrusion 25 to indicate the completion of the<br>
injection course. In this state, the anchoring portion 412 is<br>
retained in the engaging recess 563 by engagement of the third<br>
retaining protrusion 415 and the third retaining groove 565,<br>
thereby resulting in securing the needle seat 41 to the seal<br>
member 56.<br>
Subsequently, with reference to Figs. 5 and 6, when a pushing<br>
force greater than the first and second frictional forces, i.e.<br><br>
frictional forces generated between the first retaining<br>
protrusion and groove 24,350 and between the second retaining<br>
protrusion and groove 414,320, is further applied to the end<br>
cap 57, the tubular barrier member 30 is pushed to move towards<br>
the surrounding shoulder portion 222 to force the second<br>
retaining groove 320 to disengage from the second retaining<br>
protrusion 414, so that the anchoring portion 412, which remains<br>
fixedly in place due to abutment of the surrounding front end<br>
wall 411 against the surrounding abutment wall 213, is exposed<br>
to and is impacted by an impact force from the seal member 56<br>
along the axis (X) that the sealing line 566 is ruptured. Thus,<br>
the seal member 56 is released from the plunger body 54, and<br>
the needle seat 41 and the needle cannula 42, together with the<br>
seal member 56, are suctioned into the cavity 500 by a suction<br>
force resulting from a pressure difference between the ambient<br>
atmosphere and the reduced pressure in the cavity 500, as shown<br>
in Fig. 7. Note that the seal member 56 has an outer surrounding<br>
seal surface 564 which is configured to be kept in slidable<br>
contact and air-tight engagement with the inner peripheral edge<br>
portion 543 when the seal member 56 is suctioned in the front<br>
cavity segment 51. Moreover, by virtue of the shoulder portion<br>
55 and the barrier ribs 58, the assembly of the needle seat 41,<br>
the needle cannula 42 and the seal member 56 can be trapped in<br>
the cavity 500.<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 8, the inner surrounding barrel<br>
wall surface of the barrel 20 is spaced apart from the needle<br>
cannula 42 in radial directions at the forward opening 231 to<br><br>
define a surrounding clearance therebetween. In particular, a<br>
plurality of ribs 237 are disposed on the inner surrounding<br>
barrel wall surface and are angularly displaced from one another.<br>
Each rib 237 extends toward the needle cannula 42 while forming<br>
an air duct 236 between two adjacent ones of the ribs 237 to<br>
communicate the passage of the barrel 20 with the ambient<br>
atmosphere. As such, the air ducts 236 can facilitate inflow<br>
of the ambient air into the cavity 500.<br>
Referring to Figs. 9 and 10, the second preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the aforesaid embodiment in construction. The<br>
disposable syringe of this embodiment further includes a biasing<br>
member 60, such as a compression spring, which is disposed in<br>
the front surrounding region 211 to bias the needle seat 41<br>
toward the seal member 56. The biasing member 60 has two ends<br>
61, 62 abutting against the inner surrounding barrel wall surface<br>
at the forward opening 231 and the surrounding front end wall<br>
411, respectively, so as to increase the impact force to<br>
facilitate retraction action of the suctioned assembly into the<br>
cavity 500.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11, 12 and 13, the third preferred<br>
embodiment, of the disposable syringe according to this invention<br>
is shown to be similar to the first preferred embodiment in<br>
construction. In this embodiment, the surrounding front end wall<br>
411 includes a sealing member 70 which abuts against the<br>
surrounding abutment wall 213 and which is in air-tight<br>
engagement with the rear surrounding region 212 so as to maintain<br><br>
air-tightness of the compressible chamber 26 . The sealing member<br>
70 includes an elastomeric plate 71 and an elastomeric ring 72<br>
which abut against each other and which have axial holes 711, 721<br>
that extend along the axis (X) to engage fittingly the needle<br>
cannula 42 therein. In addition, the inner barrier wall surface<br>
31 of the tubular barrier member 30 further extends from the<br>
front surrounding edge portion 33 to have a deformable sealing<br>
portion 381 which is in air-tight engagement with the hub portion<br>
410 of the tubular needle seat 41.<br>
The compressible chamber 26 is filled with fluid. The hub<br>
portion 410 of the tubular needle seat 41 has a plurality of<br>
through holes 416 which are formed therethrough to be in fluid<br>
communication with the compressible chamber 26 and which extend<br>
in the longitudinal direction. As such, when the tubular barrier<br>
member 30 is moved towards the surrounding shoulder portion 222,<br>
the fluid is compressed to flow into the through holes 416,<br>
thereby helping force the anchoring portion 412 to move toward<br>
the seal member 56 so as to increase the impact force.<br>
Referring to Figs . 14 and 15, the fourth preferred embodiment<br>
of the disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the third preferred embodiment in construction,<br>
and further includes a biasing member 60 similar to that of the<br>
second preferred embodiment to bias the needle seat 41 toward<br>
the seal member 56. The biasing member 60 has two ends 61,62<br>
abutting against the inner surrounding barrel wall surface at<br>
the forward opening 231 and the elastomeric plate 71 of the<br>
sealing member 70, respectively, so as to increase the impact<br><br>
force to facilitate retraction action of the suctioned assembly<br>
into the cavity 500.<br>
Referring to Figs. 16, 17, 18 and 19, the fifth, sixth,<br>
seventh and eighth preferred embodiments of the disposable<br>
syringe according to this invention are shown to be respectively<br>
similar to the first, second, third and fourth preferred<br>
embodiment in construction, but are used for an extremely small<br>
injection volume, such as 1 ml. Thus, the barrel 20, the tubular<br>
barrier member 30, the needle assembly 40, the plunger 50 and<br>
the biasing member 60 are comparatively smaller. In addition,<br>
in stead of a separate surrounding sealing ring 59, the<br>
surrounding sealing ring in these embodiments includes a<br>
plurality of ring portions 5441 which are formed integrally with<br>
the outer peripheral wall surface 544 adjacent to the top end<br>
wall 541 for slidable and air-tight engagement with the<br>
larger-diameter segment 22. Therefore, the annular anchoring<br>
protrusion 546 and the annular retaining flange 547 (see Fig.<br>
3) may be eliminated.<br>
As shown in Fig. 20, the ninth preferred embodiment of the<br>
disposable syringe according to this invention is shown to be<br>
similar to the fifth preferred embodiment in construction. In<br>
this embodiment, the tubular barrier member 30 further includes<br>
an annular flange 341 which extends from the rear surrounding<br>
edge portion 34 and which is configured to be inserted into a<br>
clearance between the top end wall 541 of the plunger body 54<br>
and the rear surrounding edge portion 34, thereby preventing<br>
trapping of medicine within the clearance.<br><br>
As illustrated, the disposable syringe of this invention has<br>
the following advantages:<br>
1.	The suction of the tubular needle seat 41 and the needle<br>
cannula 42 occurs after the top end wall 541, the surrounding<br>
sealing ring 59, the seal member 56 and the tubular barrier<br>
member 30 are in tight contact with the tubular needle seat 41.<br>
Thus, the clearance may not exist therebetween to minimize<br>
trapping of medicine or blood within the barrel 20 after use.<br>
2.	By virtue of the first and second frictional forces and<br>
the abutment of the surrounding front end wall 411 against the<br>
surrounding abutment wall 213, the tubular needle seat 41 can<br>
be retained firmly in the retaining area during use. In addition,<br>
once the tubular needle seat 41 is released from the tubular<br>
barrier member 30 by a pushing force applied to the tubular<br>
barrier member 30, the tubular needle seat 41 can be suctioned<br>
smoothly and easily into the cavity 500.<br>
3.	After use, the needle seat 41 and the needle cannula 42<br>
can be retracted into the cavity 500 of the plunger body 54<br>
without the application of a pulling force to the plunger 50.<br>
Thus, the plunger body 54 can remain in the rear passageway 221<br>
of the barrel 20, thereby facilitating the disposal of the<br>
disposable syringe.<br><br>

has a seal member (56) to seal a cavity (500) confined in a plunger<br>
body (54) and containing a fluid at a reduced pressure. When<br>
a pushing force applied to the plunger body (54) moves the<br>
barrier member (30) against the first and second frictional<br>
forces, the needle seat (41) is released, and the seal member<br>
(56) is ruptured, so that the needle seat (41) and the needle<br>
cannula (42) are suctioned into the cavity (500) due to the<br>
pressure difference between the ambient atmosphere and the<br>
reduced pressure.</td>
