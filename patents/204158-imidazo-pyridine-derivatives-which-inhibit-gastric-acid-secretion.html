BIOLOGICAL TESTS<br><br>
/. In vitro experiments<br>
Acid secretion inhibition in isolated rabbit gastric glands<br>
     Inhibiting effect on acid secretion in vitro in isolated rabbit gastric glands was measured as described by Berglindh et al. (1976) Acta Physiol. Scand. 97,401-414.<br>
Determination ofH+,K*-ATPase activity<br>
      Membrane vesicles {2.5 to 5 ug) were incubaved for 15 min at +37°C in IS mM Pipes/Ttis buffer pH 7.4 containing 2 mM MgCl2. 10 mM KC1 and 2 raM ATP. The ATPase activity<br>
38<br><br>
was estimated as release of inorganic phosphate from ATP, as described by LeBel et al. (1978) Anal. Biochem. 85. 86-89.<br>
2. In vivo experiments<br>
Inhibiting effect on acid secretion in female rats<br>
Female rats of the Sprague-Dawly strain are used. They are equipped with cannulated fistulae in the stomach (lumen) and the upper part of the duodenum, for collection of      gastric secretions and administration of test substances, respectively. A recovery period of 14 days after surgery is allowed before testing commenced.<br>
Before secretory tests, the animals are deprived of food but not water for 20 h. The stomach is repeatedly washed thirough the gastric cannula with tap water (+37°C), and 6 ml Ringer-<br>
      Glucose given subcutaneously. Acid secretion is stimulated with infusion during 2.5-4 h (1.2 ml/h, subcutaneously) of pentagastrin and carbachol (20 and 110 nmol/kg-h, respectively), during which time gastric secretions are collected in 30-min fractions. Test substances or vehicle are given either at 60 min after starting the stimulation (intravenous and intraduodenal dosing, 1 ml/kg), or 2 h before starting the stimulation (oral dosing, 5<br>
     ml/kg, gastric cannula closed). The time interval between dosing and stimulation may be increased in order to study the duration of action. Gastric juice samples are titrated to pH 7.0 with NaOH, 0.1 M, and acid output calculated as the product of titrant volume and concentration.<br>
     Further calculations are based on group mean responses from 4-6 rats. In the case of<br>
administration during stimulation; the acid output during the periods after administration of test substance or vehicle are expressed as fractional responses, setting the acid output in the 30-min period preceding administration to 1.0. Percentage inhibition is calculated from the fractional responses elicited by test compound and vehicle. In the case of administration<br>
     before stimulation; percentage inhibition is calculated directly from acid output recorded after test compound and vehicle.<br>
39<br><br>
Bioavailability in rat<br>
Adult rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain are used. One to three days prior to the      experiments all rats are prepared by cannulation of the left carotid artery under anaesthesia. The rats used for intravenous experiments are also cannulated in the jugular vein (Popovic (1960) J. Appl. Physiol. 15, 727-728). The cannulas are exteriorized at the nape of me neck.<br>
      Blood samples (0.1 - 0.4 g) are drawn repeatedly from the carotid artery at intervals up to 5.5 hours after given dose. The samples are frozen until analysis of the test compound.<br>
Bioavailability is assessed by calculating the quotient between the area under blood/plasma concentration (AUC) curve following (i) intraduodenal (i.d.) or oral (p.o.) administration      and (ii) intravenous (i.v.) administration from the rat or the dog, respectively.<br>
The area under the blood concentration vs. time curve, AUC. is determined by the log/linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to infinity by dividing the last determined blood concentration by the elimination rate constant in the terminal phase. The systemic :      bioavailability (F%) following intraduodenal or oral administration is calculated as F(%) = (AUC (p.o. or i.d.) / AUC (i.v.)) x 100.<br>
Inhibition of gastric acid secretion and bioavailability in the conscious dog.<br>
     Labrador retriever or Harrier dogs of either sex are used. They are equipped with a duodenal fistula for the administration of test compounds or vehicle and a cannulated gastric fistula or a Heidenhaim-pouch for the collection of gastric secretion.<br>
Before secretory tests the animals are fasted for about 18 h but water is freely allowed,      Gastric acid secretion is stimulated for up to 6.5 h infusion of histamine dihydrochloride (12 ml/h) at a dose producing about 80% of the individual maximal secretory response, and<br>
40<br><br>
gastric juice collected in consecutive 30-min fractions. Test substance or vehicle is given orally, i.d. or i.v., 1 or 1.5 h after starting the histamine infusion, in a volume of 0.5 ml/kg body weight. In the case of oral administration, it should be pointed out that the test compound is administered to the acid secreting main stomach of the Heidenham-pouch dog.<br>
The acidity of the gastric juice samples are determined by titration to pH 7.0, and the acid output calculated. The acid output in the collection periods after administration of test substance or vehicle are expressed as fractional responses, setting the acid output in the      fraction preceding administration to 1.0. Percentage inhibition is calculated from fractional responses elicited by test compound and vehicle.<br>
Blood samples for the analysis of test compound concentration in plasma are taken at intervals up to 4 h after dosing. Plasma is separated and frozen within 30 min after      collection and later analyzed. The systemic bioavailability (F%) after oral or i.d. administration is calculated as described above in the rat model.<br>
