IMPROVED SYNTHETIC PROCESS FOR MIZOLASTINE<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Mizolastine, 2-[ {1 - [-1 - [(4-Fluorophenyl)methyl] -1 -H-benzimidazol-2y 1] -4-} piperidinyl} methy lamino] 4(3H)-pyrimidinone, a second generation anti-histamine having the structural formula (1) given below. <br>
Background of invention;<br>
Histamine was first identified in 1910 and was recognized as major pathogenic mediator of allergic disorders such as rhinitis and urticaria. From 1940 to 1980 more than 40 histamine receptor antagonists reached the market. However first generation agents showed poor receptor specificity and CNS activity, which resulted in sedation and anticholinergic effects. Pharmaceutical industry embarked on the task of generating new antihistamines with improved selectivity and with less antichlonergic adverse effects, which resulted in second generation antihistamines like Cetirizine, Fexofenidine and Mizolastine, along with few others.<br>
Mizolastine was originally developed by Synthelabo, as described in their patent EP 217700B, 1944 (Priority Fr 13453, 1985, USP 4,820,710, 1989) for allergic rhinoconjuctivitis and urticaria and was launched in Europe in 2000.<br>
Mizolastine can be obtained in two related ways as shown in Scheme I. Condensation of 2-Chloro-l-(4-Fluorobenzyl)benzimidazole (2) with N-(4-Piperidinyl)carbamic acid ethyl ester (3) gives N-[l-{l-(4-Fluorobenzyl)benzimidazol-2-yl]piperidine-4-yl] carbamic acid ester (4) which was methylated with Mel in DMF using NaH as base. The decarboxylative hydrolysis of the compound 5 resulted in N~{l-[l-(4-Fluorobenzyl)-lH-benzimidazol-2-yl]piperidin-4-yl]-N-methylamine (6) which was finally condensed with 2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-4(3H)-one by heating at 170Â°C to give Mizolastine. The second  route  comprised of obtaining 6  by  direct  condensation of 2-Chloro-l-(4-<br><br>
Fluorobenzyl)-lH-benzimidazole (2) with 4-methylamine piperidine (7) by means of K2C03 in refluxing isoamyl alcohol.<br><br><br>
USP 4,820,710 also describes another process (Scheme II) apart from the one already discussed.<br>
According to this method compound 2 reacted with compound 8 in an alcoholic solvent at reflux temperature to give (1).<br><br>
Recognising the importance of new antihistamines, we continued the research to develop a more efficient, simple and commercially viable process for the preparation of the said compound (1).<br>
While developing the improved process we observed that the process for the preparation of Mizolastine (1) disclosed in EP 217700 suffered from the major draw-back for obtaining (6) is long and tedious which involves N-Protection and deprotection and were not able to get pure (6) in scale-up experiments.<br>
On the other hand, the processes described in EP21700 and USP 4,820,710 suffered major draw-back of using S-methylthiouracil which releases toxic mathanethiol in the final coupling reaction.<br>
Objectives of present invention :<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a convergent synthesis of Mizolastine of the formula (1) without employing exotic, toxic and expensive chemicals thereby making the process commercially viable.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to develop a simple and efficient process for the preparation of the compound of the formula (1) which would be friendly to manufacturing chemist with simple and safe operations even in commercial applications.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to avoid column chromatography in all stages thereby making the process cost and time effecive.<br><br>
