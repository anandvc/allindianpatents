DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows an invertor 10 in accordance with a preferred embodimert of the present invention. Inverter 10 comprises a full-bridge circuit 3 having a plurality (i.e. four) silicon controlled rectifier switches, or SCRs, SI, 52, S3, and S4, two pulse control circuits labelled 1 and 2<br>
respectively, a time sequencing circuit 4, and a power switch circuit 5. The full bridge citcuit 3 is connected directly to a positive DC input terminal 14 and is coupled through the power switch circuit 5 to a negative DC input terminal 16. Referring to Fig. 1, rectifiers SI and S4 are positively connected in ;;ories between the DC input 14 and node 15, so that the anode of SI is coupled to the positive DC input 14 and the cathode of 54 is connected to node 15 and is thereby coupled, through power switch circuit 5, to the negative DC input 16. As shown in Fig, 1, rectifiers 52 and S3 arc similarly connected and are in parallel with the series connection of 51 and S4. The AC output voltage of the invertor is generated between terminals Ol and O2. As shown in Fig, 1, an AC load 6 is coupled between the terminals Ol and O2. Output terminal Ol is coupled to the cathode of SI and the anode of 54, and output terminal O2 is coupled to the cathode of S2 and the anode of S3. Diode Dl is connected in parallel with 51 so that the cathode of Dl is connected to the anode of 51 and the anode of Dl is connected to the cathode of SI. Diodes D2, D3, and D4 are similarly connected in parallel across rectifiers S2, S3, and 54 respectively, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The gate and cathode of SCRs SI and S3 are connected to differential control voltage signals Ul and U3 which are generated by Pulse Control Circuit 1. Similarly, the gate and cathode of SCRs S2 and S4 are connected to differential control voltage signals U2 and U4 which .are generated by Pulse Contro. Circuit 2.<br>
Time Sequencing Circuit 4 outputs three time-sequencing pulse signals: II, a first half-cycle time sequencing pulse which is the input to Pulse Control Circuit 1; 12, a second half-cycle time sequencing pulse which is the input to Pulse Control Circuit 2; and 13, an intermittent break-off time sequencing pulse which pulses low between the first and second half-cycles and is the input to power switch circuit 5. (See also Fig. 5 which will be described shortly and which shows the waveforms for the signals II, 12,<br>
and 13.)<br>
Preferred embodiments of the Pulse Control Circuits 1 and 2 are<br>
shown in F.gs. 2 and 3 respectively, lulse Control Circuit 1 has two pairs of mutually isolated terminals to output the control pulso signals Ul and U3, and Pulse Control Circuit 2 has two pairs of mutually isolated terminals to output the control pulse signals U2 and U4.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, pulse transformer Tl has one primary winding and two secondary windings, with the polarity marked terminal of the primary winding connected to a reference voltage +Vf and the other terminal ol the primary winding connected to the collector of transistor Ql. Note that transformer Tl need not comprise an iron core transformer. The emitter of transistor Ql is connected to ground as is one terminal of resistor R5. The base of Ql is connectod to the other terminal of resistor R5 and to one terminal of capacitor C5. The other terminal of capacitor C5 is coupled to the input timing sequence pulse signal II, Diode D5 is connected in series with the first secondary winding of transformer tl, and capacitor Cl and resistor Rl are each connected across the first secondary winding o: transformer Tl in the manner shown in Fig, 2. Diode D6, capacitor C3, and resistor R3 are similarly connected to the second secondary winding of transformer Tl. Control pulse signal Ul is output across the terminals of Cl and Rl, and control pulse signal U3 is output across the terminals of C3 and R3.<br>
The description of the configuration of Pulse Control Circuit 2 is the same as the above description for Pulse Control Circuit 1, with components C5, R5, Ql, Tl, D5, Cl, Rl, D6, C3, and R3 correspondingly replaced by C6, R6, Q2, T2, D7, C2, R2, D8, C4, and R4 respectively.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, power switch circuit 5 may comprise one power field effect transistor S5, wherein the grid or gate of S5 receives the time sequencing pulse signal 13 and thereby controls whether the channel between the source and the drain of 55, i.e. the control path, is conducting.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a possible embodiment for the Time Sequencing Circuit 4 aid how time sequencing pulses II, 12, and 13 may be generated from the signal 10 which acts as an input to the Time Sequencing Circuit 4. In an alternative embodiment, the signals II, 12, and 13 may be generated<br>
by a programmable microprocessor or a pulse curren: supply (not shown) as will b.a clear to those skilled in the art. Referring to Fig. 4, Circuit 20 generates complementary high/low signals 28 and 30 which are inverted (by conventional means not shown) every half cycle of 10. Circuit 20 may comprise a flip flop triggered by 10, or alternatively signals 28 and 30 may be generated by a programmable microprocessor. One of the signals, signal 28, from circuit 20 and the signal 10 are inputs to NOR gate 22 which outputs U, and the other signal 30 from circuit 20 and the signal 10 are inputs to NOR gate 24 which outputs 12. As a result, signal II pulses high during the first half cycle of 10, i.e the time period of tl + tO, and signal 12 pulse hig;:\ during the second half cycle of 10, i.e the time period of t2 + tO (note that t2 = tl), so that signal II and signal 12 are in phase opposition (i.e. they are ] 80 degrees out of phase with each other) as shown in the timing diagram of l;ig. 5. Referring to Fig. 4, NOR gate 26 acts as a digital inverter which inverts the input U) to produce pulse signal 13,<br>
In operation, during tho onset of the first half cycle of 10 power transistor 55 is turned on by the rising edge of 13, and transistor Qt is turned on by the rising edge of II and conducts until the voltage at the base of Ql discharges/ at a rate determined by RS and C5, below tho base-emitter threshold voltage. During the short time that Ql is conducting/ pulses are produced on each of the secondary windings of transformer Tl which charge Cl and C3 respectively through D5 and D6 respectively to a certain voltage. When Ul and U3 reach the trigger voltage necessary to turn SI and S3 on, the output voltage across Ol and O2 becomes positive as shown for VO1O2 in Fig. 5. At the end of period tl, power transistor S5 shuts off and effectively cuts off tho entire circuit, while diodes D5 and D6 roversibly isolate the bridge circuit from any back swing of transformer Tl. Once cut off, the cvrrent flowing through rectifiers SI and S3 rapidly decreases to a value below the minimum current necessary to maintain the SCRs in a conducting state, i.e, the holding current. Once 51 and S3 switch off, the output voltage across Ol and O2 goes to zero and remains at that value until the Jirst half cycle of 10 ends. Note that to prevent SI and S3 from<br><br>
possible damage, diodes Dl and D3 form a discharge loop in case an inductivo load gives rise to an inductive current during cut off of the circuit.<br>
The load 6 has a high impedance which maintains a stable current when either of the switching device pairs S1-S3 or S2-S4 are conducting. This current through the load is greater than the holding current/ which is the minimum current required to maintain the conducting SCRs in a conducting state after they have been turned on.<br>
During the second half cycle of 10, power transistor S5 repeats the same turn on and cut off operation as just described for the first cycle, except in this case 12, and not II, pulses high when 13 goes high. Control pulses U2: and U4 eventually reach a level which turns on rectifiers S2 and S4 (whilo SI and S3 remain cut off). This causes the output voltage across<br>
01	and C&gt;2 to become negative as shown for VO1O2 in Fig. 5, before it<br>
returns to zero when S2 and S4 turn off shortly after 12 and 13 go low.<br>
When 13 j;oes high again, so does II, and the cycle repeats. As illustrated in<br>
Fig. 5, the output voltage, VO1O2, is a two step per half cycle AC voltage<br>
signal.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention which is illustrated in Fig. 6, a filter capacitor C7 is connected between output terminals Ol and<br>
02	so tha: it is effectively in parallel with the load 6. The output terminals<br>
Ol and O2 are additionally coupled to the series connected terminals of SI<br>
and 54 and the series connected terminals of S2 and S3 through inductor<br>
LI and inductor L2 respectively. Inductors LI and L2 and capacitor C7<br>
thereby comprise a filter circuit which increases the duration of the rise<br>
and fall times of the output signal, thereby inhibiting high frequency<br>
components during the rising and falling edges of the output signal and<br>
consequently reducing interference with the load. In addition, inductors LI<br>
and L2 aho serve to dampen the load current so that the circuitry can be<br>
protected.<br>
Also in Fig. 6, an alternate embodiment of the power switch circuit 5 is shown comprising the power field effect transistor 55, a second power<br>
field effact transistor S6, current limiting resistor RIO, over current detecting resistor R9, gate or grid control resistor R7, gate or grid control transistor Q3, and resistor R8. Referring to Fig. 6, RIO is connected between the drain terminals of S5 and S6. The source of S6 is connected to a first terminal of R8 and a first terminal of R9, while the second terminal of R9 is connected to the negative DC voltage 16. The first terminal of R8 is also connected to the source of S5 (so that the source of S5 is connected to the source of 56} and the second terminal of R8 is connected to the base of Q3. The emitter of Q3 is connected to tho negative DC voltage 16 and the collector of Q3 is connected to the gate of S5 and a first terminal of R7. The input 13 is coupled to the second terminal of R7 as well as directly to the gate of S5. In this manner, the combination of RIO, S6, and R9 form a control loop or control path for the power switch circuit 5.<br>
In operation, the rising edge of tho input pulse signal 13 simultaneously turns on power transistors S5 and S6. Resistor R9 samples the magnitude of the load current, and when the load current reaches a certain threshold magnitude, the voltage drop across R9 turns transistor Q3 on, wliich lowers the gate potential of power transistor 55, and in turn quickly leads to 55 shutting off, With S5 cut off, the load current shifts to flow through power transistor S6, whereby it is limited by the value of resistor RIO, The above described current limiting approach, which does not entirely cut off the current loop, ensures that maximum power can be outputted while still maintaining safe operation of the circuitry.<br>
The above approach is particularly advantageous in the case of a large capidtive load (i.e. approximately 200-400 micro-Farads), such as with a rectifying circuit comprising a large capacitor and a rectifying diode. At the risi ng edge of the output signal, a large load capacitance effectively acts as a shorted ioad as it begins to charge. The current limiting function of the power switch circuitry protects the load while the load capacitor charges with the maximum output current that ensures safety and protection. Once the load capacitance has charged to the operating potential, the load current becomes too small to maintain the current<br>
sampling voltage across R9 at a value great enough to keep Q3 on. As a result powt transistor S5 turns on. With S5 on, the power consumption or dissipation in the invertor circuit is principally due to the voltage drop across the conducting SCR pair (cither SI- S3 or S2 - S4) and the voltage drop across S5, thus providing a high power efficiency. At the failing edge of 13, transistors S5 and S6 are cut off/ and the inductive load current (from LI and L2) continues to flow towards S5 so that the drain voltage of 55 rises. Diodes; Dl, D2, D3, and D4 provide a discharge loop for this current so that the SCR switches are protected, and energy is returned to positive DC voltage 14.<br>
The inverter circuit according to the present invention docs not comprise ar iron core transformer and is capable of being designed so that it's size and weight are compatible for use in small type UPS systems. In addition, the power switch circuit 5 acts to protect the entire system and enables safe and reliable inverter operation. While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described, the embodiments disclosed are illustrative and not restrictive, and the scope of the invention is intended to be defined only by the appended claims.<br><br><br>
