				<td>This Invention relates to an AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER.<br>
This AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER can roast all types of grains, either with the intermediate material or without the intermediate material. This Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is totally atomized and requires minimal unskilled Labour. This machine is of batch type production, ensures uniform heating of the grains. Further  the roasting container is not exposed to the atmosphere, thereby making the operation hygienic. This Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is compact in size and as such occupies less space. The stirrer derives rotating power from the motor adjusted to suit the required torque and rpm. Further, temperature controller is coupled to the burner, which controls the roasting of the grains to the required temperature and thus also saves fuel. Provision has been made in the Control Panel to control the roasting time also.<br>
This Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster basically consists of a main body (2), housing an Inner Container (3), which is well insulated by Insulation Material (5), such as Fire Bricks, Wool etc., well designed to contain the flame around the Inner Container. A Burner (7) is positioned adjacent to the Inner Container as substantially shown in the accompanying Drawing. A Passage (6) for the flame way is provided all around the outer of the Inner Container. Inlet Funnel (1) is fixed to the top of the Main Body, through which the grains to be roasted are fed. A Bottom Door (8) is provided at the bottom of the Inner Container, through which the roasted particles exit. A handle (9) is provided to open and close the exit door.<br><br>
Stirrer Blades (4) along with the Stirrer Pipe (11) is mounted along with the stirrer housing (15) above the Inner Container. Stirrer Shaft(14) is inserted into the stirrer Pipe (11) and a slot (17) on this stirrer pipe helps to rotate the pipe with the shaft and also facilitates upward and downward movements. The Stirrer Pipe and Door Handle (9) are linked through a Connecting Pipe (16). This provision helps in opening the door automatically as and when the rotating stirrer moves upwards and vice-versa. A Control panel (10) is provided with automatic time and temperature control gadgets along with a stabilizer, a contactor and motor switches. A Motor (13) is provided at the top, which drives the stirrer rod to the required rpm through a suitable pulley. A flue gas outlet pipe (12) ensures the safe exit of the flue gases. An application for Patent Registration by the same applicants under No: 807/MAS/1999 dated 11*â€™ August, 1999 has already been made. However, in this Invention, certain improvisations have been made over the claims made vide the earlier application. In the earlier application, the heating zone that surrounded the inner container had a different profile. Whereas in this improvised version, the flame way has been modified to be more effective, thus increasing the overall efficiency of the roaster.<br>
The grains to be roasted are fed to the Inner Container through the Inlet<br>
Funnel. Owing to the force exerted by the stirrer, the grains are made to strike<br>
against the inner wall of the Inner Container. The flame from the burner passes<br>
through the fine way and surrounds the outer of the Inner Container, heating<br>
the container and consequently roasting the grains. The temperature and the<br>
time controlling gadgets provided on the Control Panel, take care of the<br>
prescribed      parameters.	Once      the     required      temperature      is<br>
reached and the grains   have been roasted to suffice the requirement, the<br><br>
movement of the stirrer in the upward direction facilitates the gathering of the roasted grains at the bottom of the inner Container, ready for exit, once the bottom door (8) gives way. A Voltage Stabilizer is provided in the Control Panel to take care of the voltage fluctuations. As the arrangement in the said Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is for roasting without intermediate material, roasting with intermediate material is also possible by providing a perforated assembly to separate grains from intermediate material, at the outlet end.<br>
In the conventional pan roasting method, after the roasting of the grains and the intermediate material, the operation has to be stopped to separate the roasted grains from the intermediate material by using mesh, manually. In such cases, uniform heating of the grains is not ensured. Consequent to which, each grain particle gets heated to a different degree, which has been overcome to a great extent in this Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster. Further, in this Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster, we can vary the roasting time depending upon the moisture content in the grain. In the Conventional systems, roasting depends upon the skill of the operator and many a times there are chances that the grains get over-roasted. This draw back has been overcome to a great extent in this Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster.<br>
A significant drawback in the continuous type roaster is that the exit of all the roasted grains from the heating zone is not simultaneous as in the case of batch-type roaster and is in the form of a queue. Consequently, there is a time lag, when taken to the crushing section, between the first grain mud the last grain that have left the roaster, as the first grain that exits, would have collected at the bottom of the collecting container and the last grain that exits at the top of the collecting container. This gestation period owing to the n on-simultaneous exit<br><br>
)f the roasted grains adversely affects the crushing quality, which has been }overcome in this Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster.<br>
The Flame way/Heat Zone (6) is crucial for the efficiency of the system and it has been tried out and established that a profile of the Heating Zone as shown in (6) of Fig. B is the most suitable to maximize the heating and consequently a profile of the Heating Zone as sketched is adopted in this system.<br><br><br>
We Claim,<br>
1.	An AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER, comprising of a Main Body (2), housing an Inner Container (3) in which the grains are roasted, which in turn accommodates a Stirrer-Blade, Stirrer Pipe Assembly (4 &amp; 11)  which not only rotate along their axis, but also move up and down linearly by virtue of their engagement with a Stirrer Shaft (14), which derives its rotary motion from a Motor -Pulley arrangement (13) and as the Stirrer -Blade, Stirrer-Pipe Assembly moves up the roasted grains collect at the bottom of the Inner Container, where an exit point for the roasted grains is provided manned by a Door (8), provided with a Handle (9), either to open or close the Door, the Stirrer Pipe and the Handle being linked by a Connecting Rod (16), which facilitates synchronization of the movements; roasting of the grains being taken care by the hot gas from a Burner (7), provided within the Main Body.<br>
2.	An AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER, as claimed in Claim (1), wherein the Inner Container is totally insulated by covering it with Insulating Material (5), comprising of either Fire Bricks or Wool, which constitute a Flame Way (6) surrounding the Inner Container and a Outlet Pipe (12) provides a safe exit for the flue gas.<br>
3.	An AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER, as claimed in Claims (1) &amp; (2), wherein a Control Panel (10) is provided, which carries temperature and time gadgets for controlling the temperature and time parameters and also is provided with a Voltage Stabilizer.<br><br>
4. An AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER, as claimed in Claims (1), wherein the axis of the Main Body(2) and the axis of the Inner Container (3) do not coincide and are offset</td>
