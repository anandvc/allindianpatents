PROCEDURE FOR NON SYNCHRONIZED RADIO ACCESS<br>
(NSRA) RESOURCE ASSIGNMENT<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[1]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
70/872,818 filed on October 25, 2007, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety.<br>
[2]	The present invention is directed to a RACH initial access procedure in a UE, and<br>
particularly, to a method for conveying the information necessary for the initial access<br>
procedure with less overhead.<br>
[3]	Universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a 3rd Generation (3G)<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system operating in wideband code division<br>
multiple access (WCDMA) based on European systems, global system for mobile<br>
communications (GSM) and general packet radio services (GPRS). The long-term<br>
evolution (LTE) of UMTS is under discussion by the 3rd generation partnership<br>
project (3GPP) that standardized UMTS.<br>
[4]	The 3GPP LTE is a technology for enabling high-speed packet communications.<br>
Many schemes have been proposed for the LTE objective including those that aim to<br>
reduce user and provider costs, improve service quality, and expand and improve<br>
coverage and system capacity. The 3G LTE requires reduced cost per bit, increased<br>
service availability, flexible use of a frequency band, a simple structure, an open<br>
interface, and adequate power consumption of a terminal as an upper-level re-<br>
quirement.<br>
[5]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating network structure of an evolved universal<br>
mobile telecommunication system (E-UMTS). The E-UMTS may be also referred to as<br>
an LTE system. The communication network is widely deployed to provide a variety<br>
of communication services such as voice and packet data.<br>
[6]	As illustrated in FIG. 1, the E-UMTS network includes an evolved UMTS terrestrial<br>
radio access network (E-UTRAN), an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and one or more<br>
user equipment. The E-UTRAN may include one or more evolved NodeB (eNodeB)<br>
20, and a plurality of user equipment (UE) 10 may be located in one cell. One or more<br>
E-UTRAN mobility management entity (MME)/system architecture evolution (SAE)<br>
gateways 30 may be positioned at the end of the network and connected to an external<br>
network.<br>
[7]	As used herein, "downlink" refers to communication from eNodeB 20 to UE 10, and<br><br>
"uplink" refers to communication from the UE to an eNodeB. UE 10 refers to com-<br>
munication equipment carried by a user and may be also be referred to as a mobile<br>
station (MS), a user terminal (UT), a subscriber station (SS) or a wireless device.<br>
[8]	An eNodeB 20 provides end points of a user plane and a control plane to the UE 10.<br>
MME/SAE gateway 30 provides an end point of a session and mobility management<br>
function for UE 10. The eNodeB and MME/SAE gateway may be connected via an S1<br>
interface.<br>
[9]	The eNodeB 20 is generally a fixed station that communicates with a UE 10, and<br>
may also be referred to as a base station (BS) or an access point. One eNodeB 20 may<br>
be deployed per cell. An interface for transmitting user traffic or control traffic may be<br>
used between eNodeBs 20.<br>
[10]	The MME provides various functions including distribution of paging messages to<br>
eNodeBs 20, security control, idle state mobility control, SAE bearer control, and<br>
ciphering and integrity protection of non-access stratum (NAS) signaling. The SAE<br>
gateway host provides assorted functions including termination of U-plane packets for<br>
paging reasons, and sw itching of the U-plane to support UE mobility. For clarity<br>
MME/SAE gateway 30 will be referred to herein simply as a "gateway," but it is<br>
understood that this entity includes both an MME and an SAE gateway.<br>
[11]	A plurality of nodes may be connected between eNodeB 20 and gateway 30 via the<br>
S1 interface. The eNodeBs 20 may be connected to each other via an X2 interface and<br>
neighboring eNodeBs may have a meshed network structure that has the X2 interface.<br>
[12]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram depicting architecture of a typical E-UTRAN and a typical<br>
EPC. As illustrated, eNodeB 20 may perform functions of selection for gateway 30,<br>
routing toward the gateway during a Radio Resource Control (RRC) activation,<br>
scheduling and transmitting of paging messages, scheduling and transmitting of<br>
Broadcast Channel (BCCH) information, dynamic allocation of resources to UEs 10 in<br>
both uplink and downlink, configuration and provisioning of eNodeB measurements,<br>
radio bearer control, radio admission control (RAC), and connection mobility control<br>
in LTE_ACTIVE state. In the EPC, and as noted above, gateway 30 may perform<br>
functions of paging origination, LTE-IDLE state management, ciphering of the user<br>
plane, System Architecture Evolution (SAE) bearer control, and ciphering and integrity<br>
protection of Non-Access Stratum (NAS) signaling.<br>
[13]	FIGS. 3 and 4 are block diagrams depicting the user-plane protocol and the control-<br>
plane protocol stack for the E-UMTS. As illustrated, the protocol layers may be<br>
divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based upon the<br>
three lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) standard model that is well<br>
known in the art of communication systems.<br>
[ 14]	The physical layer, the first layer (L1), provides an information transmission service<br><br>
to an upper layer by using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected with a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer located at a higher level through a transport<br>
channel, and data between the MAC layer and the physical layer is transferred via the<br>
transport channel. Between different physical layers, namely, between physical layers<br>
of a transmission side and a reception side, data is transferred via the physical channel.<br>
[15]	The MAC layer of Layer 2 (L2) provides services to a radio link control (RLC) layer<br>
(which is a higher layer) via a logical channel. The RLC layer of Layer 2 (L2) supports<br>
the transmission of data with reliability. It should be noted that the RLC layer il-<br>
lustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4 is depicted because if the RLC functions are implemented in<br>
and performed by the MAC layer, the RLC layer itself is not required. The PDCP layer<br>
of Layer 2 (L2) performs a header compression function that reduces unnecessary<br>
control information such that data being transmitted by employing Internet protocol<br>
(IP) packets, such as IPv5 or IPv7, can be efficiently sent over a radio (wireless)<br>
interface that has a relatively small bandwidth.<br>
[16]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer<br>
(L3) is only defined in the control plane and controls logical channels, transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to the configuration, reconfiguration,<br>
and release of the radio bearers (RBs). Here, the RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN.<br>
[17]	As illustrated in FIG. 3, the RLC and MAC layers (terminated in an eNodeB 20 on<br>
the network side) may perform functions such as Scheduling, Automatic Repeat<br>
Request (ARQ), and Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ). The PDCP layer<br>
(terminated in eNodeB 20 on the network side) may perform the user plane functions<br>
such as header compression, integrity protection, and ciphering.<br>
[18]	As illustrated in FIG. 4, the RLC and MAC layers (terminated in an eNodeB 20 on<br>
the network side) perform the same functions as for the control plane. As illustrated,<br>
the RRC layer (terminated in an eNodeB 20 on the network side) may perform<br>
functions such as broadcasting, paging, RRC connection management, Radio Bearer<br>
(RB) control, mobility functions, and UE measurement reporting and controlling. The<br>
NAS control protocol (terminated in the MME of gateway 30 on the network side) may<br>
perform functions such as a SAE bearer management, authentication, LTE_IDLE<br>
mobility handling, paging origination in LTE_IDLE, and security control for the<br>
signaling between the gateway and UE 10.<br>
[19]	The NAS control protocol may use three different states; first, a LTE_DETACHED<br>
state if there is no RRC entity; second, a LTE_IDLE state if there is no RRC<br>
connection while storing minimal UE information; and third, an LTE_ACTIVE state if<br>
the RRC connection is established. Also, the RRC state may be divided into two<br>
different states such as a RRC_IDLE and a RRC_CONNECTED.<br><br>
[20]	In RRC_IDLE state, the UE 10 may receive broadcasts of system information and<br>
paging information while the UE specifies a Discontinuous Reception (DRX)<br>
configured by NAS, and the UE has been allocated an identification (ID) which<br>
uniquely identifies the UE in a tracking area. Also, in RRC-1DLE state, no RRC<br>
context is stored in the eNodeB.<br>
[21]	In RRC_CONNECTED state, the UE 10 has an E-UTRAN RRC connection and a<br>
context in the E-UTRAN, such that transmitting and/or receiving data to/from the<br>
network (eNodeB) becomes possible. Also, the UE 10 can report channel quality in-<br>
formation and feedback information to the eNodeB.<br>
[22]	In RRCLCONNECTED state, the E-UTRAN knows the cell to which the UE 10<br>
belongs. Therefore, the network can transmit and/or receive data to/from UE 10, the<br>
network can control mobility (handover) of the UE, and the network can perform cell<br>
measurements for a neighboring cell.<br>
[23]	In RRC_1DLE mode, the UE 10 specifies the paging DRX (Discontinuous<br>
Reception) cycle. Specifically, the UE 10 monitors a paging signal at a specific paging<br>
occasion of every UE specific paging DRX cycle.<br>
[24]	The paging occasion is a time interval during which a paging signal is transmitted.<br>
The UE 10 has its own paging occasion.<br>
[25]	A paging message is transmitted over all cells belonging to the same tracking area. If<br>
the UE 10 moves from one tracking area to another tracking area, the UE will send a<br>
tracking area update message to the network to update its location.<br>
[261	A physical channel transfers signaling and data between layer L1 of a UE and eNB.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 5, the physical channel transfers the signaling and data with a<br>
radio resource, which consists of one or more sub-carriers in frequency and one more<br>
symbols in time.<br>
[27]	One sub-frame, which is 1.0 ms. in length, consists of several symbols. The<br>
particular symbol(s) of the sub-frame, such as the first symbol of the sub-frame, can be<br>
used for the L1 / L2 control channel. The L1 / L2 control channel carries L1 / L2<br>
control information, such as signaling.<br>
[28]	A transport channel transfers signaling and data between the LI and MAC layers. A<br>
physical channel is mapped to a transport channel.<br>
[29]	Downlink transport channel types include a Broadcast Channel (BCH), a Downlink<br>
Shared Channel (DL-SCH), a Paging Channel (PCH) and a Multicast Channel (MCH).<br>
The BCH is used for transmitting system information. The DL-SCH supports HARQ,<br>
dynamic link adaptation by varying the modulation, coding and transmit power, and<br>
both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation. The DL-SCH also may enable<br>
broadcast in the entire cell and the use of beamforming. The PCH is used for paging a<br>
UE. The MCH is used for multicast or broadcast service transmission.<br><br>
[30]	Uplink transport channel types include an Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH) and<br>
Random Access Channel(s) (RACH). The UL-SCH supports HARQ and dynamic link-<br>
adaptation by varying the transmit power and potentially modulation and coding. The<br>
UL-SCH also may enable the use of beamforming. The RACH is normally used for<br>
initial access to a cell.<br>
[31]	The MAC sublayer provides data transfer services on logical channels. A set of<br>
logical channel types is defined for different data transfer services offered by MAC.<br>
Each logical channel type is defined according to the type of information transferred.<br>
[32]	Logical channels are generally classified into two groups. The two groups are control<br>
channels for the transfer of control plane information and traffic channels for the<br>
transfer of user plane information.<br>
[33]	Control channels are used for transfer of control plane information only. The control<br>
channels provided by MAC include a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), a Paging<br>
Control Channel (PCCH), a Common Control Channel (CCCH), a Multicast Control<br>
Channel (MCCH) and a Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH). The BCCH is a<br>
downlink channel for broadcasting system control information. The PCCH is a<br>
downlink channel that transfers paging information and is used when the network does<br>
not know the location cell of a UE. The CCCH is used by UEs having no RRC<br>
connection with the network. The MCCH is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel<br>
used for transmitting MBMS control information from the network to a UE. The<br>
DCCH is a point-to-point bi-directional channel used by UEs having an RRC<br>
connection that transmits dedicated control information between a UE and the network.<br>
[34]	Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information only. The traffic-<br>
channels provided by MAC include a Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH) and a<br>
Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH). The DTCH is a point-to-point channel, dedicated<br>
to one UE for the transfer of user information and can exist in both uplink and<br>
downlink. The MTCH is a point-to-multipoint downlink channel for transmitting<br>
traffic data from the network to the UE.<br>
[35]	Uplink connections between logical channels and transport channels include a DCCH<br>
that can be mapped to UL- SCH and a DTCH that can be mapped to UL-SCH.<br>
Downlink connections between logical channels and transport channels include a<br>
BCCH that can be mapped to BCH, a PCCH that can be mapped to PCH, a DCCH that<br>
can be mapped to DL-SCH, and a DTCH that can be mapped to DL-SCH.<br>
[36]	It is known that different cause values may be mapped on the signature sequence<br>
used to send messages between a UE and eNB and that either Channel Quality<br>
Indicator (CQI) or path loss and cause or message size are candidates for inclusion in<br>
the initial preamble. FIG. 6 illustrates different messages exchanged between a UE and<br>
eNB during initial access.<br><br>
[37]	When a UE wishes to access the network and determines a message to be<br>
transmitted, the message may be linked to a purpose and a cause value may be<br>
determined. The size of the ideal message number 3 illustrated in FIG. 6 may also be<br>
determined by identifying all optional information and different alternative sizes, such<br>
as by removing optional information, or an alternative "scheduling request" message<br>
may be used.<br>
[38]	The UE acquires necessary information for the transmission of the preamble, UL in-<br>
terference, Pilot Transmit power and required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for the<br>
preamble detection at the receiver or combinations thereof. This information must<br>
allow the calculation of the initial transmit power of the preamble. It is beneficial to<br>
transmit the uplink message in the vicinity of the preamble from a frequency point of<br>
view in order to ensure that the same channel is used for the transmission of the<br>
message.<br>
[39]	The UE should take into account the uplink interference and the uplink path loss in<br>
order to ensure that the network receives the preamble with a minimum SNR. The<br>
uplink interference can be determined only in the ENodeB and, therefore, must be<br>
broadcast by the ENodeB and received by the UE prior to the transmission of the<br>
preamble. The uplink path loss can be considered to be similar to the downlink path<br>
loss and can be estimated by the UE from the received Rx (receiver) signal strength<br>
when the transmit power of some pilot sequence of the cell is known to the UE.<br>
[40]	The required uplink SNR for the detection of the preamble would typically depend<br>
on the NodeB configuration, such as a number of Rx antennas and receiver<br>
performance. There may be advantages to transmitting the rather static Transmit power<br>
of the pilot and the necessary uplink SNR separately form the varying uplink in-<br>
terference and possibly the power offset required between the preamble and the<br>
message.<br>
[41]	The initial transmission power of the preamble can be roughly calculated according<br>
to the following formula:<br>
[42]	Transmit power = TransmitPilot - RxPilot + ULInterference + Offset +<br>
SNRRequired.<br>
[43]	Therefore, any combination of SNRRequired, ULInterference, TransmitPilot and<br>
Offset can be broadcast. In principle, only one value must be broadcast. This is es-<br>
sentially the method in current UMTS systems, although the UL interference in LTE<br>
will mainly be neighboring cell interference that is probably more constant than in<br>
UMTS.<br>
[44]	The UE determines the initial uplink transmit power for the transmission of the<br>
preamble as explained above. The receiver in the eNB is able to estimate the absolute<br>
received power as well as the relative received power compared to the interference in<br><br>
the cell. The eNB will consider a preamble detected if the received signal power<br>
compared to the interference is above an eNB known threshold.<br>
[451	The UE performs power ramping in order to ensure that a UE can be detected even if<br>
the initially estimated transmission power for the preamble is not adequate. Another<br>
preamble will most likely be transmitted if no acknowledgement or a negative ac-<br>
knowledgement is received by the UE before the next random access attempt. The<br>
transmit power of the preamble can be increased, and / or the preamble can be<br>
transmitted on a different uplink frequency in order to increase the probability of<br>
detection,. Therefore, the actual transmit power of the preamble that will be detected<br>
does not necessarily correspond to the initial transmit power of the preamble as<br>
initially calculated by the UE.<br>
[46]	The UE must determine the possible uplink transport format<br>
[47]	The transport format, which may include Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)<br>
and a number of resource blocks that should be used by the UE, depends mainly on<br>
two parameters, specifically the SNR at the eNB and the required size of the message<br>
to be transmitted.<br>
[48]	In practice, a maximum UE message size, or payload, and a required minimum SNR<br>
correspond to each transport format. In UMTS, the UE determines before the<br>
transmission of the preamble whether a transport format can be chosen for the<br>
transmission according to the estimated initial preamble transmit power, the required<br>
offset between preamble and the transport block, the maximum allowed or available<br>
UE transmit power, a fixed offset and additional margin. The preamble in UMTS need<br>
not contain any information regarding the transport format selected by the UE since the<br>
network does not need to reserve time and frequency resources and, therefore, the<br>
transport format is indicated together with the transmitted message.<br>
[49]	The eNB must be aware of the size of the message that the UE intends to transmit<br>
and the SNR achievable by the UE in order to select the correct transport format upon<br>
reception of the preamble and then reserve the necessary time and frequency resources.<br>
Therefore, the eNB cannot estimate the SNR achievable by the UE according to the<br>
received preamble because the UE transmit power compared to the maximum allowed<br>
or possible UE transmit power is not known to the eNB, given that the UE will most<br>
likely consider the measured path loss in the downlink or some equivalent measure for<br>
the determination of the initial preamble transmission power.<br>
[50]	The eNB could calculate a difference between the path loss estimated in the<br>
downlink compared and the path loss of the uplink. However, this calculation is not<br>
possible if power ramping is used and the UE transmit power for the preamble does not<br>
correspond to the initially calculated UE transmit power. Furthermore, the precision of<br>
the actual UE transmit power and the transmit power at which the UE is intended to<br><br>
transmit is very low. Therefore, it has been proposed to code the path loss or CQI<br>
estimation of the downlink and the message size or the cause value in the uplink in the<br>
signature.<br>
[51]	Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the de-<br>
scription which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>
learned by practice of the invention. It is to be understood that both the foregoing<br>
general description and the following detailed description of the present invention are<br>
exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the<br>
invention as claimed.<br>
[52]	In one aspect of the present invention, a method of establishing a communication link<br>
between a mobile terminal and a network is provided. The method includes identifying<br>
at least two groupings of signatures for accessing the network, each of the at least two<br>
groupings representing at least one combination of at least one transport format and at<br>
least one radio condition, selecting a signature from one of the at least two groupings,<br>
the selection according to one of the represented combinations and requesting access to<br>
the network using the selected signature.<br>
[531	It is contemplated that each of the at least one radio condition includes one of<br>
required uplink transmit power, reception quality of downlink signals, uplink in-<br>
terference, available power headroom and an anticipated difference between maximum<br>
allowed uplink transmit power and uplink transmit power. It is further contemplated<br>
that no specific combination of at least one transport format and at least one radio<br>
condition is represented by both of the at least two groups<br>
[54]	It is contemplated that the method further includes receiving an indication of the at<br>
least two groupings of signatures. It is further contemplated that the method further<br>
includes receiving a response acknowledging receipt of the access request, the<br>
response including resources for accessing the network and transmitting data using the<br>
resources.<br>
[55]	It is further contemplated that selecting a signature from one of the at least two<br>
groupings includes determining an amount of data to transmit and allowable power<br>
headroom. It is further contemplated that determining an amount of data to transmit<br>
includes at least one of determining alternate message sizes for transmitting data and<br>
removing optional information from the data.<br>
[56]	It is contemplated that the method further includes not receiving a response ac-<br>
knowledging receipt of the access request within a specified amount of time and<br>
requesting access to the network again using a signature re-selected from one of the at<br>
least two groupings according to one of the represented combinations. It is further con-<br>
templated that the signature is re-selected from one of the at least two groupings<br>
according to whether a represented combination of at least one transport format and at<br><br>
least one radio condition can accommodate an increase in transmission power of the<br>
access request.<br>
[57]	It is contemplated that re-selecting a signature from one of the at least two groupings<br>

[80]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The<br>
present invention is directed to a RACH initial access procedure in a UE.<br>
[81]	The present invention proposes a method to allow an accurate choice of the UL<br>
transport format. The new method allows the UE to determine by itself whether a<br>
certain transport format may be used for the transmission of message 3 in FIG. 6 prior<br>
to the first preamble transmission and prior to the power ramping.<br>
[82]	The UE determines the transmit power for message 3 in FIG. 6 based on the transmit<br>
power of the preamble that has been detected by the eNB. It is clear that a minimum<br>
SNR is necessary for the successful transmission of an UL message, such as message 3<br>
in FIG. 6. At the same time, it is necessary that the preamble, such as message 1 in<br>
FIG. 6, be received with a certain SNR in order to be considered as successfully<br>
received by the NodeB.<br>
[83]	The eNB knows the SNR required for successful detection of the preamble since the<br>
SNR necessary for message 3 for each available transport format is also known by the<br>
eNB. The eNB can indicate an offset for transmission of message 3 compared to the<br>
transmission power of the preamble, the offset indicated even before the preamble is<br>
detected.<br>
[84]	The present invention takes into account more aspects of the potential procedure for<br>
the NSRA and considers how the information included in messages may be reduced<br>
through linking the physical procedure and the MAC behavior while still conveying<br>
the necessary information.<br>
[85]	A fixed or broadcast margin may be used as the offset relative to the estimated initial<br>
preamble transmission power. This is possible because the UE knows the currently<br>
used transmit power for the preamble, the maximum available or allowed transmit<br>
power. Alternatively, the UE may re-evaluate which transport format may be<br>
transmitted prior to each transmission of a preamble, assuming that the eNB detects the<br>
preamble.<br>
[86]	According to the present invention, it is essentially the UE that determines which of<br>
the available transport formats are available for transmission before each transmission<br>
of the preamble. This reduces sensitivity to an erroneous estimation of the necessary<br>
transmit power necessary for detection of the preamble.<br>
[87]	A UE would then only determine a transport format that it is able to transmit. The de-<br>
termination is made according to the transmit power of the preamble that the UE will<br>
use, the difference between preamble transmit power and the required power for<br>
transmission of message 3 as indicated by the eNB, and the maximum available or<br><br>
allowed UE Transmit power.<br>
[88] The eNB need not check whether the UE transmit power is sufficient when a UE<br>
indicates a signature corresponding to a certain transport format for transmission. This<br>
is because the detection of the UE already implies that the UE transmit power and the<br>
uplink channel quality is sufficient to transmit the required transport format.<br>
[89]	Therefore, the only information that the signature must indicate is the transport<br>
format that the UE requests to use and further information, such as CQI or path loss,<br>
need not be coded in the preamble in order to determine the possible transport formats<br>
for transmission of message 3. Furthermore, the eNB may indicate an additional offset<br>
in message 2 for the transmission of message 3 compared to the transmission power of<br>
the preamble if the transmit power chosen by the UE results in a higher SNR in the<br>
eNB than is needed for detection. It is beneficial to transmit the uplink message in<br>
vicinity of the preamble from a frequency point of view in order to ensure that the<br>
same channel is used for the transmission of the message.<br>
[90]	FIG. 7 illustrates a random access procedure according to the present invention. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7, the necessary information for the calculation of the preamble is<br>
gathered in steps S10 to S50 in order to ensure detection of the initial preamble and<br>
prepare a message, if any, for transmission.<br>
[91]	The information that is needed in the UE includes any combination of uplink in-<br>
terference, pilot transmit power, required SNR and possibly additional offsets in order<br>
to calculate the necessary preamble transmit power based on the measured received<br>
pilot receive power as well as allowed transport formats for transmission of a RACH<br>
message in the uplink, offsets related to the power with which the preamble has been<br>
transmitted for each transport format, and information related to power ramping for<br>
successive preamble transmissions. Transport formats should include at least the<br>
available payload size, but other information, such as coding type and necessary time /<br>
frequency resources, may be included.<br>
[92]	One additional margin, or a specific margin per transport format, is necessary if the<br>
estimation of the allowed transport formats for the uplink is done only once prior to the<br>
transmission of the initial preamble. This allows the UE to determine whether a<br>
transport format may be transmitted including a margin for eventual power ramping<br>
based on the estimated initial preamble transmission power. Signature / time /<br>
frequency resources associated with each transport format should also be made<br>
available, specifically if no message needs to be transmitted.<br>
[93]	The needed information may either be broadcast on the system information in a cell<br>
or fixed in a standard. The order in which steps S10 to S50 are performed is inter-<br>
changeable.<br>
[94]	The UE determines in step S60 which transport formats may be used based on the<br><br>
transmission power that will be used for the transmission of the preamble. This de-<br>
termination may be performed once before the transmission of the first preamble, with<br>
a set of possible transport formats identified by the UE according to the transport<br>
formats for which the following equation is fulfilled:<br>
[95] <br>
[96]	Alternatively the determination may be performed before each transmission of the<br>
preamble. In this case, the available set of possible transport formats may change<br>
during the procedure if the transmit power is increased or if parameters, such as the<br>
uplink interference value, change.<br>
[97]	The UE then chooses from the possible transport formats the transport format that<br>
allows the largest version of the message that should be transmitted. The transport<br>
format that requires the least transmit power, adds the least padding, or uses the least<br>
time / frequency resources may be chosen if several transport formats are possible.<br>
[98]	It is not necessary that the possible transport formats be determined prior to choosing<br>
the transport format that best suits the message size. The suitable transport formats<br>
may be determined first and then which of the suitable transport formats may be used<br>
is determined based on the initial power estimation.<br>
[99]	As illustrated in step S70, the RACH procedure is ended unsuccessfully if no<br>
transport format can be chosen that allows transmission of at least the smallest version<br>
of the message based on the determined preamble transmit power. As illustrated in step<br>
S80, the UE then selects a signature and a time / frequency resource for transmission<br>
from a set corresponding to the selected transport format if a suitable transport format<br>
has been identified.<br>
[100] Different transport formats might be coded on the same group of signatures, for<br>
example, if the time / frequency resources required are the same. A specific set of<br>
signatures and time / frequency resources could be reserved for when no message part<br>
is supposed to be transmitted and a UE that has no message to be transmitted can<br>
choose a signature from this set.<br>
[101] It is determined in step S80 whether the UE receives an ACK. The ACK may include<br>
a timing advance value and an uplink resource assignment.<br>
[102] The UE transmits the message using the determined transport format, as illustrated in<br>
step S100, if an ACK is received. An additional offset, such as Off overshoot, may be<br>
overshoot<br>
included in the ACK if the eNB detects that the transmission power of the preamble<br>
exceeds the threshold. In this case, the message is sent with a power determined<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
[103] <br><br>
[104] The UE determines whether to stop the procedure unsuccessfully or continue with<br>
the preamble transmission at another occasion, as illustrated in step S90, if a negative<br>
acknowledgement or no acknowledgement is received from the eNB. If it is<br>
determined to continue with the preamble transmission at another occasion, the UE<br>
will increase its preamble transmission power if applicable and / or change the<br>
frequency resources used for the transmission of the next preamble, as illustrated in<br>
step S110. Depending upon whether the UE determines the uplink transport format at<br>
each transmission of the preamble or whether uplink transport format is determined<br>
only once for the transmission of the first preamble, the process then returns to either<br>
step S60 or S0.<br>
[105] Two possible methods are contemplated. The UE may determine a transport format<br>
for use based on the message size and transport format information and associated<br>
offsets and, possibly, a margin compared to the transmission power of the initial or the<br>
next preamble, with transport format information and offset information either<br>
broadcast on system information or fixed in a standard. On the other hand, the UE may<br>
choose the signature and time / frequency resources for the preamble transmission<br>
based on a chosen transport format, where each transport format corresponds to a set of<br>
signatures and time / frequency resources that are either fixed in a standard or<br>
broadcast by the eNB and from which the UE chooses randomly or based on other<br>
criteria. Different transport formats may use the same set of signatures if, for example,<br>
different transport formats require the same time / frequency resources.<br>
[106] FIG. 8 illustrates a block diagram of a mobile station (MS) or access terminal 2. The<br>
AT 2 includes a processor (or digital signal processor) 110, RF module 136, power<br>
management module 106, antenna 150, battery 166, display 116, keypad 120, memory<br>
130, SIM card 126 (which may be optional), speaker 156 and microphone 160.<br>
[107] A user enters instructional information, such as a telephone number, for example, by<br>
pushing the buttons of a keypad 120 or by voice activation using the microphone 160.<br>
The microprocessor 110 receives and processes the instructional information to<br>
perform the appropriate function, such as to dial the telephone number. Operational<br>
data may be retrieved from the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 126 or the<br>
memory module 130 to perform the function. Furthermore, the processor 110 may<br>
display the instructional and operational information on the display 116 for the user's<br>
reference and convenience.<br>
[108] The processor 110 issues instructional information to the RF module 136, to initiate<br>
communication, for example, transmits radio signals comprising voice communication<br>
data. The RF module 136 comprises a receiver and a transmitter to receive and<br>
transmit radio signals. An antenna 150 facilitates the transmission and reception of<br>
radio signals. Upon receiving radio signals, the RF module 136 may forward and<br><br>
convert the signals to baseband frequency for processing by the processor 110. The<br>
processed signals would be transformed into audible or readable information outputted<br>
via the speaker 156, for example. The processor 110 also includes the protocols and<br>
functions necessary to perform the various processes described herein.<br>
