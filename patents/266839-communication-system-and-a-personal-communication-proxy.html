THE PATENT ACT 1970<br>
 (39 of 1970) <br>
&amp; <br>
The Patents Rules, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1.   Communication System And A Personal communication Proxy.<br>
2.<br>
(A)	IPRBOX OY<br>
(B)	FINLAND<br>
(C)	Keilaranta 14, FI-02150 Espoo Finland.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a communication system providing services to at least one subscriber apparatus which is capable of communicating over a short-range radio system, such as Bluetooth.<br>
2. Description of Prior Art<br>
Previously there are known communication systems where service providers offer services. Such services can in prior art solutions be accessed via computers connected to the Internet or by using mobile phones of cellular radio systems. In order to obtain services from a specific service provider the subscriber uses a computer or mobile phone in order to transmit a service request to the selected service provider. This service request is forwarded via the communication system to a server of the selected service provider based on address information included in the service request.<br>
A drawback in these prior art communication systems is lack of user , friendliness as the subscriber in practice has to manually use a computer or mobile phone in order to send a service request. A subscriber might have available several other subscriber apparatuses with a need to transmit service requests. However, prior art solutions fail to provide these other apparatuses with the possibility of transmitting service requests.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above-mentioned drawback and to provide a solution with improved user friendliness. This object is achieved with the communication system according to independent claim 1, the personal communication proxy according to independent claim 5 and the computer program according to independent claim 10.<br>
The invention utilizes the fact that more and more devices are already during their manufacturing provided with equipment for communicating over a short-range radio system. Bluetooth is an example of such a short-<br><br><br>
range radio system. These devices therefore have the basic capability needed for transmitting service requests. The personal communication proxy is capable of receiving and processing the service requests in accordance with information about service providers stored in advance in the memory of the personal communication proxy. Thus, the service requests can be forwarded via the personal communication proxy to service providers selected in advance by the subscriber. It is therefore no longer necessary for the subscriber to manually transmit service requests with a mobile phone or computer, but instead also several other subscriber apparatuses can be used to transmit service requests, in some cases even automatically. The user friendliness is thus significantly better than in prior art solutions.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the communication system and the personal communication proxy of the invention are disclosed in dependent claims 2 to 4 and 6 to 9.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the present invention will be described in closer detail by way of example and with reference to the attached drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a first preferred embodiment of the •  communication system according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a first preferred embodiment of a personal communication proxy according to the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a first preferred embodiment of the communication system according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a communication system including service providers 1 arranged to receive service requests. The service providers 1 can in practice be implemented as servers of different companies. One of the available services can be, for instance, printing of photographs, in which case a subscriber can send his pictures taken with a digital camera via the communication system to this service provider for printing. Another available service might be a repair shop for household appliances, such as for a dishwasher. In that case, a service request to the service provider offering this service might result in a service man from the company offering this service<br><br><br>
paying a visit to the home of the subscriber in order to check the condition of the dishwasher. It should, however, be observed that the above-mentioned subscriber apparatuses are only two examples of possible apparatuses which can be used in the system according to the invention.<br>
The system 1 further includes a service gateway 2 with a data storage 5. The service providers 1 and the service gateway 2 communicate with each other via a suitable wired or wireless communication path 6. One alternative is to use the Internet for this communication.<br>
The service gateway 2 maintains information about the service providers 1 in the data storage 5 (such as a computer memory or hard disk). This information includes also information about the services offered by the different service providers. When a new service provider is added to the system and when there is a change in the services offered by one of the service providers, the information in the data storage 5 is updated in order to take into account the change.<br>
The data storage 5 of the service gateway 2 also includes other information, such as information about each personal communication proxy 7 which is authorized to utilize services via the service gateway 2. Each time a service request is received at the service gateway 2 from a personal communication proxy 7, the service gateway analyses the service request in order to identify the personal communication proxy from where the service request was sent, and in order to ensure that the identified personal communication proxy is authorized to utilize services via the service gateway 2. If the personal communication proxy is authorized, then the service request is forwarded from the service gateway to a service provider 1. The service provider is identified based on information included in the service request.<br>
The service gateway 2 also maintains other information, such as billing information. Each time a service request is sent to one of the service providers 1, the account of the personal communication proxy from where the service request was received is updated in order to charge the subscriber (owner or user) of the personal communication proxy for the service request. One alternative is to charge only a fee for forwarding the request. Alternatively, also the service provided by the service provider 1 can be charged via the service gateway 2. In the latter case when the service is printing photographs, then the service provider carrying out the printing can transmit a message to<br><br><br>
the service gateway in order to indicate the amount that needs to be charged from the account of the personal communication proxy in question.<br>
To make such charging possible, it is necessary for subscribers who want to use the service gateway 2 to register in advance. Thus, an account can be established and a suitable charging routine (for instance via a bill or via a credit card) can be agreed on. If the service provided by a service provider is charged via the service gateway, then an account needs to be established also for the service provider in order to credit the service provider for the services provided.<br>
The personal communication proxy 7 can consist of a fixed device, such as a computer unit installed in the home of the subscriber. Alternatively, the personal communication proxy 7 can consist of a portable device, such as a mobile phone. The personal communication proxy communicates with the' service gateway 2 via a wired or wireless communication path 11. In case of a fixed device, this communication path can consist of the Internet, for instance. A wireless communication path can be implemented via a GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Service) or WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) connection.<br>
The subscriber (user) of the personal communication proxy 7 can ' access the information stored in the data storage 5 of the service gateway 2 in order to find out the services and service providers available via the service gateway 2. In this connection, the subscriber can select preferred service providers 1 and store information about them in the memory of the personal communication proxy 7. The subscriber can also store his address and name in the memory of the personal communication proxy. This information together with information identifying the personal communication proxy can be added to service requests transmitted from the personal communication proxy 7 to the service gateway 2.<br>
A digital camera is an example of a subscriber apparatus 8 which can be used in the communication system of Figure 1. In this example, it is assumed that the digital camera 8 and the personal communication proxy 7 are both equipped with devices that enable two-way communication between them via a short-range radio system 9, such as a Bluetooth system. In this example it is assumed that the subscriber apparatus uses the Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol (SDP).   In that case, when the subscriber has<br><br><br>
taken a picture with the camera 8 and wants to print it via a service provider 1, the subscriber uses the user interface of the camera 8 in order to access the communication system. The personal communication proxy 7 detects that a subscriber apparatus is accessing the system, and transmits a list of available service providers via the short-range radio system 9 to the camera 8. This list consists of information regarding those service providers which the subscriber has previously selected and which therefore is stored in the memory of the personal communication proxy 7. The subscriber can then view the list of the available service providers, select a service provider and transmit a service request including the picture information and an identifier of the service provider to the personal communication proxy 7. The personal communication proxy adds information which makes it possible to identify the personal communication proxy to the service request, and forwards it to the service gateway 2. The service gateway forwards the service request to the selected service provider 1, where the picture is printed and delivered by mail to the subscriber. The fee for printing the picture can be charged via the service gateway or alternatively as a separate bill from the service provider to the subscriber.<br>
An other example of a subscriber apparatus 10 which can be used ' in the communication system of Figure 1 is a dishwasher. In this example, it is assumed that the dishwasher is not capable of two-way communication with the personal communication proxy 7. Thus, it is sufficient that the dishwasher includes only a transmitter for the short-range radio system 9. The dishwasher is configured to automatically transmit a service request with this transmitter to the personal communication proxy 7, as soon as a malfunction has occurred in the dishwasher 10.<br>
The subscriber has stored information in advance in the memory of the personal communication proxy regarding the dishwasher. This information indicates that all service requests from this subscriber apparatus should be sent to a specific service provider 1, in other words such a service provider who provides the service of repairing dishwashers. Thus, the personal communication proxy is able to identify the correct service provider and send the service request to this service provider. Before sending, the address and name of the subscriber and also information identifying the personal communication proxy 7, are added to the service request. In this way, the<br><br><br>
service provider will automatically receive information about a malfunction in the dishwasher of the subscriber. A service man can then pay a visit to the home of the subscriber directly or alternatively having contacted the subscriber in order to agree about a suitable time for the visit.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates, the personal communication proxy 7 of Figure 1 in more detail as a block diagram.<br>
In order to facilitate communication over the short-range radio system the personal communication proxy is equipped with a radio transmitter and receiver 12. In case the subscriber apparatuses are of such a type that they are unable to handle two way communication (as the dishwasher in the previous example) it is sufficient that the personal communication has only a receiver.<br>
In this example, it is assumed that the personal communication proxy 7 comprises a user interface 13. Such a user interface can be implemented with a key pad and a display, for instance. This user interface 13 is used by the subscriber to access the information stored in the data storage 5 of the service gateway 2 in order to find out the services and service providers available via the service gateway 2. In this connection the subscriber can select preferred service providers 1 and store information about them in the memory 14 of the personal communication proxy 7. The subscriber can also store his address, name, telephone number and other suitable information in the memory 14 of the personal communication proxy.<br>
According to the present invention the personal communication proxy 7 does not need to have a user interface of the type described above. In that case, it is sufficient to have an interface to an external device instead in order to carry out the tasks described above. Such an interface can be for instance an interface to a computer, a mobile phone or to a network such as to a local area network or the Internet. In that case, the external device which is used for the above mentioned tasks can consist of a computer or mobile phone, which is used to make the selections of the service providers and to store the personal information of the subscriber in the memory via this interface.<br>
The personal communication proxy 7 also comprises a processor 15 which controls the operation of the personal communication proxy 7, and which also carries out the necessary tasks in order to process service requests<br><br><br>
received via the receiver. The computer program used by the processor in order to control the operation of the personal communication proxy can be stored in the memory 14.<br>
In the example of Figure 2, it is assumed that the service requests are sent via a fixed communication path 11 to the service gateway. In this case, only an interface to the fixed communication path is sufficient. However, in case the communication path 11 is a wireless communication path, then the personal communication proxy 7 also needs a transmitter and receiver in order to carry out the communication with the service gateway.<br>
The personal communication proxy 7 shown in Figure 2 can be implemented as a fixed computer unit installed in the home of the subscriber, for instance. Alternatively the personal communication proxy 7 can consist of a portable device, such as a mobile phone.<br>
In the previous examples it has been explained that the personal communication proxy 7 communicates with the service providers via the service gateway. It is, however, according to the present invention also possible to use the personal communication proxy 7 for communication directly with the service providers via a suitable communication path such as a cellular radio system). In such an embodiment the personal communication proxy is provided with suitable communication means, such as a radio transmitter and receiver, in order to send service requests to the service providers.<br>
It is to be understood that the above description and the accompanying figures are only intended to illustrate the present invention. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the invention can be varied and modified also in other ways without departing from the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
