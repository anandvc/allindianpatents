				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of air braked railway vehicles/locomotives. The device is used to stop a railway train soon after one or more of its vehicles/locomotives have derailed, without human attention, so as to minimize damage to Railway track, vehicles, other railway infrastructure, commodities or passengers and environment. The device also stops a railway train when one or more of its vehicles/locomotives experience abnormal riding due to certain types of defects/failures of track/ vehicles without need for human observation and action.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The prior art is associated with certain disadvantages in respect of reliability by way of unwarranted actuation of Abnormal riding /Derailment detectors and false indication without derailment or high vertical accelerations being experienced by the railway vehicle/locomotive, and need for stopping of train operations for manual resetting or replacement of the device.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improved device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of air braked railway vehicles which overcomes the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved device for detection of derailment and abnormal ridings of air braked railway vehicles so as to initiate braking action, to stop the train in shortest possible time and distance after any abnormal riding is experienced by the vehicle(s) due to initiation of derailment or otherwise irrespective of human observation and response, which also gives a signal to driver of the train through brake pipe by sudden drop in air pressure.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an improved device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of air braked railway vehicles so as to avoid actuation under a very high horizontal acceleration. Additionally the present invention also allows it to be reset automatically after a designed time lapse or as per another embodiment<br><br>
of the present invention manually, which allows the train to be stopped and driver to take requisite action and restart the train after ensuring safe condition of complete train without any attention by maintenance staff and need for isolation of the derailment detector.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for use with vehicles of a railway train to stop the train in case of abnormal riding of railway vehicles/locomotives, comprising a sealed pressure chamber disposed centrally between a rubber/polymer disc fixed on upper face of a mass provided with a special profile, which is spring loaded and being capable of sliding vertically in a bush disposed in the lower housing, and an upper housing, being closed by a diaphragm/bellow at its upper end. The upper face of the spring loaded diaphragm/bellow butting against the open end of the brake pipe connector so as to keep it closed when there is pressure due to air from brake pipe inside the sealed pressure chamber. The sealed pressure chamber gets charged with compressed air through a non-return/ pressure regulating valve fixed centrally in the diaphragm/bellow when train is in service and brake pipe is charged with compressed air from the locomotive for the first time or whenever<br><br><br>
pressure in sealed pressure chamber is low. Once the sealed pressure chamber is charged with maximum brake pipe air pressure, the auxiliary pressure chamber, formed on the side of upper housing with an air tight cover is also charged slowly through a choke with filters. A bellow fixed on the side of upper housing inside the auxiliary pressure chamber keeps a slidable lock pin in a horizontal bushed hole in upper housing, pressing the upper side of mass with a small force, when there is adequate pressure inside the auxiliary pressure chamber.<br>
When the mass experiences vertical accelerations higher than threshold value, it pulls the mass downward along with the rubber/polymer disc, and thus opens the sealed pressure chamber resulting in drop in air pressure inside it, and hence the sealing force of the diaphragm drops against end of brake pipe connector. This permits air from brake pipe to push the diaphragm/bellow downwards and vent air in brake-pipe connector through the side holes, dust filter and protective baffle cover fixed to the brake pipe connector and drops the pressure in brake pipe to apply brakes to the vehicle and adjoining vehicles automatically. The lock pin slides inwards so as to butt on top face of the mass, which has<br><br>
moved downward due to high acceleration being experienced by the device, thus temporarily restraining the rubber/polymer disc from closing the nozzle on the sealed pressure chamber. Air from the auxiliary pressure chamber discharges slowly through the choke into sealed pressure chamber where the pressure has dropped to near atmospheric pressure. When pressure in auxiliary pressure chamber reaches to a near atmospheric level after a lapse of some time, the spring loaded lock pin retracts outwards from the top face of the mass, forcing the bellow outward, thus permitting the mass to move upward due to spring force and rubber/polymer disc again closes the lower end of the nozzle on the sealed pressure chamber.<br>
Thus the device is reset and ready for normal train operation to be resumed provided there is no other unsafe condition on the train, when brake pipe is charged with compressed air from the locomotive.<br>
An indication device is provided by means of an indicator pin having two grooves, sliding in a hole in the upper housing and exposed on one end to an opening in the upper housing, and is attached to a bellow which<br><br>
is fixed on the side face of the upper housing. A spring loaded ball rests inside a hole in an extension of the upper housing and secured by a screw plug, and the ball rests in the outer groove of the indicator pin under normal conditions. When the mass moves downward due to high accelerations, the compressed air from the sealed pressure chamber rushes out into the space available between the upper housing and lower housing. This air pushes the indicator pin outwards, providing a clear passage for the air through another hole in the upper housing and lower housing through a filter. The indicator pin outward moves till the ball rests in the other groove of the indicator pin, along with the bellow or till the bellow and indicator pin are stopped by the partly open safety stop fixed to the side of housing. This results in a small portion of the specially colored bellow along with indicator pin projecting out from the side face of the upper housing, and becomes clearly visible to any train personnel, even after the device has got reset automatically. The bellow along with indicator pin is pushed back manually after observation by the train staff, so that in case of fresh actuation indicator device becomes functional again.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of the device, it is provided with a spring loaded lock pin, provided with a dust protected bellow/grommet, on side of the upper housing which locks the mass due to spring force when mass moves downwards and can be reset by pulling the pin outward manually. The auxiliary pressure chamber, choke and bellow actuated lock pin are not provided in the upper housing in this embodiment.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the device for use to activate the braking system of a running train having brake application system with the use of compressed air in any type of brake system and to stop the train in case of derailment or any other occurrence resulting in abnormal riding, the device is provided with the rail vehicles/ locomotives comprising of a upper/lower housing, adopted to be secured with brake pipe connector and upper housing. A spring loaded mass having special serrations on one end, being placed in a bush on the vertical side of the lower housing.<br>
A polymer/rubber disc is fixed on the upper face of the mass and a diaphragm/bellow being provided on the upper side of the upper housing<br><br>
in a hermetically sealed manner so as to provide a sealed pressure chamber being charged with compressed air from brake pipe connector through a non-return valve/pressure regulating valve to maintain a constant pressure above the atmospheric pressure. The upper face of diaphragm/bellow presses against the lower end of the brake pipe connector and keeps the end of pipe connector closed due to the high force exerted by compressed air inside the sealed pressure chamber under normal conditions of train running.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved device for detection of derailment and abnormal riding of air braked railway vehicles/locomotives comprising of a lower housing secured to an upper housing, wherein the lower housing accommodates a bush for enabling vertical movement of a specially profiled mass therein, in which the spring loaded mass is having a rubber/polymer disc on its top face, and a diaphragm along with a Non return/pressure regulating valve provided on upper end of the upper housing and at its lower end a nozzle is provided and the upper housing is secured to a brake pipe connector .<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Reference may be made to fig. 1, wherein the device has a lower housing (1), which is adapted to be secured with upper housing (5). A bush of suitable metal/polymer (2) is fixed in the lower housing (1) for enabling movement of specially profiled mass (3) in vertical direction under high vertical force/acceleration. Mass (3) is compressed by the spring (4). A<br><br>
rubber/polymer disc (7) is fixed on top face of the mass (3). An upper housing (5) is fixed on top of the lower housing (1). Lower end of the upper housing (5) is provided with a small nozzle (6) which butts against the rubber disc (7) fixed on top of mass (3), and a diaphragm (8) is fixed to upper end of upper housing (5) with a washer (9) and provided with a support disc (10) in its lower part. A non-return valve/pressure regulating valve (12) ( not an object of the present patent application) is provided centrally in the support disc (10). A brake pipe connector (13) is fixed to top of upper housing (5) so that its lower mouth butts against the top face of diaphragm/bellow (8). Thus a sealed pressure chamber ( C) is formed between rubber disc ( 7) and diaphragm (8) in upper housing (5).<br>
A plurality of holes (B) are provided on the sides of the brake pipe connector (13) for passage of air from brake pipe (A) through an isolating valve (14) ( not an object of present patent application) provided at the top of brake pipe connector (13). Chamber (C) is charged with compressed air from brake pipe of the train through the non-return valve/pressure regulating valve(12). The upper face of the diaphragm (8)<br><br>
keeps the end of the brake pipe connector (13) closed to the atmosphere in normal circumstances of train running. A filter (15) is fixed outside the holes in brake pipe connector (13) which is further provided with a protection cover (16) with baffles and fixed to the brake pipe connector (13).<br>
An auxiliary pressure chamber (D) is formed on the side of the upper housing (5) with a pressure chamber cover (17) which is charged with compressed air from sealed pressure chamber (C) through a choke (22) provided with filters (24), which fills it with compressed air gradually. A bellow (18) is fixed with washer (19) on a vertical side of the upper hosing (5) inside the auxiliary pressure chamber. The lock pin (20) is integrally attached to one end of the lock pin (20) which is slidably provided in a bush (23) in a horizontal hole in upper housing (5) and is capable of being forced outward by a spring (21) .<br>
An indicator pin (25) is slidably provided in a hole in an extension of upper housing (5) and its inner face is exposed to an opening in the upper housing. A ball (27) compressed by a spring (28) held by a screw plug (29) is provided in a hole in upper housing (5) so that ball rests on a<br><br>
groove in the indicator pin (25). The indicator pin (25) is integrally provided with a bellow (26) on its outer side which is also fixed to side of the upper housing (5). A thin safety strap (31) is fixed to side of the upper housing (5). A filter (30) is provided on the bottom end of the upper housing (5) to prevent entry of dust and permit compressed air escaping from sealed pressure chamber to vent upon actuation of the device and maintain atmospheric pressure through a hole (E) in top face of the lower housing(l). The upper housing (5) is provided with holes ( F) on another side of housing for fixing the device on the under frame of the railway vehicle / locomotive.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the device in actuated condition.<br>
The reduction in the pressure in the brake pipe (A) results in automatic application of brakes in the rail vehicle(s) / locomotive and this reduction in pressure can also be observed by the driver of the train, who then can take necessary action to supplement the braking action. After stoppage of the train and observing safety of the vehicles the driver can restart the train by releasing the brakes followed by charging brake pipe with<br><br>
compressed air, which also recharges the sealed pressure chamber and the device becomes fully functional again. After actuation of the device, the indicator pin gets pushed outside and stays in that position until detection of vehicle with actuated device in a train during manual examination and then reset by pushing it back inside .<br>
Fig. 3 shows another embodiment of the device suitable for use with air braked rail vehicles without automatic reset features but with manually re-settable lock. This is similar to that shown and explained in fig. 1. This device is provided with a spring (21) loaded lock pin (20) sliding in a bush (23) fixed in side of the upper housing (5). The spring is held between a collar (17) on lock pin (20) and lock support (19), which is fixed to the side of upper housing (5). A rubber bellow (18) is provided on the head of lock pin (20) to prevent entry of dust into the device. The lock pin (20) slides over top face of mass (4), as soon as it moves downwards due to high vertical accelerations being experienced beyond threshold limit by the device and locks the mass (40 in that position . The lock pin (20) needs to be pulled back manually by the train crew for resetting the device after stopping the train and compulsorily observing safe<br><br>
conditions for resumption of onward train operation as considered necessary.<br>
