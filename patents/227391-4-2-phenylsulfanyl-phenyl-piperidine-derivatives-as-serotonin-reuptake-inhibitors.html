4-(2-Phenylsulfanyl-phenyI)-piperidine derivatives as serotonin reuptake inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and as such effective in the treatment of for example depression and anxiety.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (hereinafter referred to as SSRIs) have become first choice therapeutics in the treatment of depression, certain forms of anxiety and social phobias, because they are effective, well tolerated and have a favourable safety profile compared to the classic tricyclic antidepressants.<br>
However, clinical studies on depression indicate that non-response to SSRIs is substantial, up to 30%. Another, often neglected, factor in antidepressant treatment is compliance, which has a rather profound effect on the patient's motivation to continue pharmacotherapy.<br>
First of all, there is the delay in therapeutic effect of SSRIs. Sometimes symptoms even worsen during the first weeks of treatment. Secondly, sexual dysfunction is a side effect common to all SSRIs. Without addressing these problems, real progress in the pharmacotherapy of depression and anxiety disorders is not likely to happen.<br>
In order to cope with non-response, psychiatrists sometimes malce use of augmentation strategies. Augmentation of antidepressant therapy may be accomplished through the co-administration of mood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate or triiodothyronin or by the use of electroshock.<br>
The effect of combined administration of a compound that inhibits serotonin reuptalce and a 5-HTIA receptor antagonist has been evaluated in several studies (Linis et al Eur. 1 Pharmacol 1987, 143, 1095-204 and Gartside5r. J. Pharmacol 1995, 115, 1064-1070, Blier et al Trends in Pharmacol Science 1994, 15, 220).    In these<br><br>
studies, it was found that 5-HT1A receptor antagonists would abolish the initial brake on 5-HT neurotransmission induced by the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thus produce an immediate boost of 5-HT transmission and a rapid onset of therapeutic action.<br>
Several patent applications have been filed, which cover the use of a combination of a 5-HTIA antagonist and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of depression (see e.g. EP-A2-687472 and EP-A2-714663).<br>
Another approach to increase terminal 5-HT would be through blockade of the 5-HTIB autoreceptor. Microdialysis experiments in rats have indeed shown that increase of hippocampal 5-HT by citalopram is potentiated by GMC 2-29, an experimental 5-HTIB receptor antagonist.<br>
Several patent applications covering the combination of an SSRI and a 5-HTIB antagonist or partial agonist have also been filed (WO 97/28141, WO 96/03400, EP-A-701819 and WO 99/13877).<br>
It has previously been found that the combination of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a compound having 5-HT2C antagonistic or inverse agonistic effect (compounds having a negative efficacy at the 5-HT2C receptor) provides a considerable increase in the level of 5-HT in terminal areas, as measured in microdialysis experiments (WO 01/41701). This would imply a shorter onset of antidepressant effect in the clinic and an augmentation or potentiation of the therapeutic effect of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).<br>
The present invention provides compounds which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of affective disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders including general anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, panic attacks, specific phobias, social phobia and agoraphobia. Some of the compounds also have a combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2C receptor modulation, which according to WOO 1/41701 would imply a faster onset of antidepressant activity.<br><br>

Measurements of [3H]-5-HT uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes.<br>
Whole brains from male Wistar rats (125-225 g), excluding cerebellum, are homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose supplemented with ImM nialamid with a glass/teflon homogenizes The homogenate is centrifuged at 600 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet is discarded and the supernatant is centrifuged at 20.000 x g for 55 min. The final pellet is homogenized (20 sec) in this assay buffer (0.5 mg original tissue/well). Test compounds (or buffer) and 10 nM [3H]-5-HT are added to 96 well plates and shaken briefly. Composition of assay buffer: 123 mM NaCl, 4.82 mM KCl, 0.973 mMCaCl2,1.12 mM MgS04, 12.66 mM Na2HP04, 2.97 mM NaH2P04, 0.162 mM EDTA, 10 mM glucose and 1 mM ascorbic acid. Buffer is oxygenated with 95% 02/5% CO2 for 10 min at 37 °C and pH is adjusted 7.4. The incubation is started by adding tissue to a final assay volume of 0.2 mL. After 15 min incubation with radioligand at 37 °C, samples are filtered directly on Unifilter GF/C glass fiber filters (soaked for 1 hour in 0.1% polyethylenimine) under vacuum and immediately washed with 3 x 0.2 mL assay buffer. Non-specific uptake is determined using citalopram (10 jiM final concentration). Citalopram is included as reference in all experiments as dose-response curve.<br>
Preferred compounds of the present invention exhibit serotonin reuptake inhibition below 200 nM (IC50) in the assay above. More preferred are the compounds which exhibit inhibition below 100 nM and most preferably below 50 nM.<br><br>
[3H]Mesulergine binding to 5-HT2C receptors.<br>
Cell lines expressing 10-20 pmol/mg protein human 5-HT2c-vsv receptors (Euroscreen) were harvested in ice-cold 50 mM Tris pH 7.7 buffer containing 125 mM NaCl and stored at -80 ° C. On the day of the experiment cells were quickly thawed and homogenized in 50 mM Tris pH 7.7 using an Ultra-Thurax. Aliqouts consisting of 6-30 (-tg protein, [3H]Mesulergine (1 11M) and testsubstance were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Total binding was determined using assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.7) and non-specific binding was defined in the presence of 100 |oM 5-HT. Bound and free [3H]Mesulergine was separated by vacuum filtration on GF/B filters (pre-soaked in 0.1% PEI for lA hour) and counted in a scintillation counter.<br>
5-HT2C receptor efficacy as determined by fluorometry.<br>
This assay was carried out as described by Porter et al. British Journal of Pharmacology 1999, 128, 13 with the modifications described below. 2 days before the experiment CHO cells expressing 10-20 pmol/mg protein human 5-HT2c-vsv receptors (Euroscreen) were plated at a density sufficient to yield a mono-confluent layer on the day of the experiment. The cells were dye loaded (Ca2+-Jrit from Molecular Devices, and according to their instructions) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator at 95% humidity. Lazer intensity was set to a suitable level to obtain basal values of approximately 8000 RFUs. The variation in basal fluorescence was less than 10%. EC50 values were assessed using increasing concentrations of test compound covering 3 decades. IC50 values were assessed challenging the EC85 of 5-HT with concentrations covering 3 decades of test substances. K1 values were calculated using Cheng-Prusoff equation.<br><br><br><br><br>
