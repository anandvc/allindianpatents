				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a biosensor for measuring dopamine or other biochemicals/metabolites such as dopamine glucose. Particularly, the present invention relates to a strip and a process for making disposable micro-band electrode based disposable test strips for dopamine and a Dopamine biosensor made there from. This particular invention is useful for monitoring dopamine concentration present in biological samples.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Mammals, particularly humans, are highly sensitive to external or internal stimuli which alter neurotransmitter impulse activity that indirectly after the steady-state level of messengers RNA encoding based neurotransmission. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system is relatively well defined and is responsible for neural function. Within the blood brain barrier the steady state of neural transmission is maintained based on the following biochemical recycling of neural transmitter :<br>
TH	DDC	DBH	PNMT<br>
Tyrosine —&gt; L-Dopa —► Dopamine —► Norepinephrine —►Epinephrine<br>
TH-tyrosine hydrolase; DDC-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; DBH=dopamine-ß-hydrolase; PNMT=phenylethanolamine-N-<br>
methyltransferase.<br>
The status of brain (physiological) is defined by the steady-state autonomous inter-conversion of above neurotransmitters in response to external or internal stimuli. A long term disorder, in response to a particular stimuli in steady-state autonomous inter-conversion of above neurotransmitters, causes disorder (European Patent, 0514490 Al 921125) in brain physiology (US Patent, 4701407, 1987, European Patent, WO 9858076 Al 19881223, European Patent, WO 9807426 Al 19880226) leading to psychotic problem (US Patent, 4772791, 1988) and manifest diseases like Parkinson's, Schizophrenia (European Patent, WO 9637780 Al 961128), mania etc. Additionally Epinephrine and Norepinephrine is also responsible for cardiac physiology, hence these disorder may cause cardiac arrest.<br>
One of the important Neurotransmitter i.e. dopamine play a central role during disorder of neuronal autonomous inter-conversion. When such disorder is physiologically adopted by the human, the concentration of dopamine alter in CSF first and subsequently in out side the blood brain barrier e.g. in blood. Both decrease and increase in dopamine concentration severely affects the status of brain. Drugs like cocaine (US Patent 5853696, 1998); morphine etc is likely to cause such disorder (US Patent, 4712561, 1987) and alter the dopamine concentration and in such cases an increased level of dopamine in cerebro-spinal fluids (CSF) and in blood is expected. Accordingly, a biosensor, suitable for detecting dopamine concentration in a drop of blood/CSF is essentially one of the emergent need not only in India but as a whole world. Efforts have<br>
been made to detect dopamine following direct or indirect detection systems are available. For examples indirect detection involves : a) the composition and methods for diagnosing schizophrenia based on modification of the dopamine receptor is reported (US Patent, 5686255, 1997); b) allelic diagnosis of susceptibility to compulative disorder (US Patent, 5550021, 1996); c) cDNA encoding a dopamine transporter (US Patent, 5312734, 1994); d) detection reagent and antibody specific for dopamine releasing protein (US Patent, 5330895, 1994); e) allelic association of the human dopamine receptor gene in compulsive disorder such as alcoholism (US Patent, 5210016, 1993); f) method for detecting dopaminergic diseases using fluorine-18 radiolabeled dopamine receptor ligands (US Patent, 4931270, 1990); g) methods land electrodes (individual or composite) for the detection and measurement of hydrogen peroxideformed by electrolytically oxidizing a phenolic compound (especially phenol itself or dopamine (European Patent, 0672167 Al 950920). The direct detection of dopamine is so far conducted by HPLC system. All the above systems for direct or indirect detection of dopamine has following major drawbacks :<br>
a)	Some of the methods are highly expensive for analysis (&gt; 10 lac casting the system),<br>
b)	require technical expertise,<br>
c)	non-portable,<br>
d)	relatively much longer time of analysis,<br>
e)	non-suitability for routine analysis,<br>
f)	Less feasibility of commercialisation.<br>
Several other methods of dopamine detection specifically electrochemical one have been developed at laboratory level. Many authors i.e. Hall et al, (Anal. Chim. Acta, 213 (1988) 113-119); Cosnier &amp; innocent (J. Electroanal. Chem., 328 (1992) 361-366), Cosnier and Labbe (in uses of Immobilized biological compounds; Eds. G.G. Guilbault &amp; M. Mascini, Academic Press, 1993. pp 231-244); Wang et al (Labbe (in uses of Immobilized biological compounds, Eds. G.G. Guilbault &amp; M. Mascini, Academic Press, 1993, pp 231-244); Campanella et al (Talanta, 41(1994)1397-1404); Iwuoha et al (Biosensor &amp; Bioelectronics, 10 (1995)661-667) describe the analysis of catacholamine in organic phase which does not suits for clinical purposes. Scheller et al (Biosensor &amp;Bioelectronics, 10 (1995) 717-722) describe a coupled enzymatic system for sensitive detection of catacholamine in aqueous phase however the system is so complicated that test protocol in one step can not be developed for routine analysis of these catacholamine. In all these cases the amperometric detection of catacholamine was conducted. A potentiometric sensor involving poly (crown ether) has also been reported for the detection of catacholamines and other dihydroxybenzene derivatives (Biosensor &amp; Bioelectronics, 10 (1995)705-715). In all these systems, the selectivity for dopamine is not observed and the system could not be put at commercial scale. Accordingly, lack of disposable strip based electronic digital display system for the real time analysis of dopamine and subsequently a commercial biosensor for dopamine is not available so far.<br>

EXAMPLE -1<br><br>
1)       Micro-band electrode based test strip for dopamine :   The<br>
micro band electrode which also referred as test strip is made using a DEK screen printer (DEK J 1202). For the printing of micro-band electrode on PVC substrate initially four different screen on which nylon cloth having mesh size 170 µl exposed by photography using a positive of desired dimension of the test strips with full printing covered area. The four different screens having the exposed area of; (i) having the unit micro-band dimension of 32 to 38 mm in length, 5 to 7 mm width with a 1 to 1.5 mm gap in center with a total printing area of 80 x 70 mm to provide 9-12 pairs of exposed screen area; the second one (ii) having unit microband dimension of 10 to 12 mm length, 2 to 3 mm width to provide 9 to 12 unit of exposed printing area; the dimension of third one (iii) is similar to that of second one however the exposed printed area is shifted to 3 to 4 mm in either direction of total printing area; the fourth one (iv) having unit micro-band dimension of 28 to 32 mm length, 2.2 to 3.2 mm width to with a exposed area of 8 to 9 mm x 1.8 to 3.2 mm at one end to provide 9 to 12 pairs micro-band electrodes. A PVC substrate of 100 mm x 100 mm is used for printing the different inks. First a silver conductive tracks are printed using screen (I) and silver paste followed by printing of silver-silver chloride track on one of end of conducting tracks (single conducting track of one pair micro-band electrode) which again followed by printing a graphite paste on the other conducting   tracks   which   is   not   covered   by   silver-silver<br>
chloride printing using screen (ii) On the graphite printed trach enzyme ink is printed using screen (iii) The first three inks (silver, silver chloride and graphite paste are purchased from ELTECKS corporation, Bangalore. The enzyme ink was made with (hydroxyethyl solution (1-2% w/w) containing 0.5% polyethylene glycol (Mol. Wt. 4000 to 6000), Horseradish peroxidase solution in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (25 to 35 % w/w) and graphite power (73 to 63 &amp; w/w) thoroughly mixed together to form a paste. The consecutive three printing silver tracks, silver-silver chloride tracks and graphite paste tracks are followed by curing each printing under UV drier at 40°C for 20 min. the enzyme ink printing is followed by its curing<br>
at 25°C in vacuum dessicator. Finally the un-desired printed<br>
*=—	<br>
area is masked by printing a vinyl ink which is commercially available and cured at 25°C for 5h. After drying the printed area, each pair of microband electrode comprising of a silver-silver chloride and enzyme tracks over silver conducting tracks are cut out and stored at 25°C.<br>
Electronic unit for holding micro-band electrode and subsequent arrangement of variable voltage source followed by signal processing through IC based LCD display: A printed circuit board (general purpose PCB) which commercially available is used for the fabrication of electronic circuit. All the Ics, resistors, capacitors and LCD as given in block diagram (Fig. 1} and circuit diagram (Fig.2) are fixed on PCB/PTH   followed   by   single   printing/double   printing   of<br>
desired components as shown in Fig.2. A strip holder is attached to the PCB to hold the strip with the arrangement for polarizing the test strip at desired voltage (200 mV vs Ag/AgCl).<br>
The strip function on the following reaction scheme :<br>
HRP(I) + peroxide	—►  HRP (II)   + H2O		(1)<br>
HRP(II) + dopamine         —► HRP (I) + oxidized dopamine ...(2)<br>
Oxidized dopamine + e- —► dopamine		(3)<br>
A small current change as a function of dopamine concentration is generated across the circuit. The HRP and peroxide are in excess so that it does not act as a rate limiting step. The activity of HRP on the strip is monitored to be 50 unit and the peroxide concentration choosed its 5 mM. Under this condition the presence of dopamine at ng/ml level could be monitored.<br>
The sensing of dopamine is conducted following the adjustment of gain (multiplexure) on calibrate mode. The micro-band electrode is then placed into the strip holder of the electronic unit. A standard solution of dopamine in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 containing 5 mM hydrogen peroxide is made. 5- 10 µl of the standard solution is placed over the active exposed portion of the test strip and the concentration of dopamine is read after 30 s delay.<br>
Advantages<br>
1.	The test strip is highly sensitive to dopamine.<br>
2.	Detect dopamine level is 30 s.<br>
3.	Ng/ml   sensitivity  of the   test  strip  in  combination  of digital electronic unit.<br>
4.	Inexpensive as compared to any other reported method for dopamine detection.<br>
5.	Portable unit for dopamine detection.<br>
6.	Real time analysis of dopamine.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
