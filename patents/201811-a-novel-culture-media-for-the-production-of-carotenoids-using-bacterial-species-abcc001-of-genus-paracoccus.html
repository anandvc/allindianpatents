				<td>The present invention relates to a novel f p. 7, for the production of carotenoids using bacterial specie genus II Paracoccus.<br>
nhshqcf<br>
The other objective of the present inventio carotenoid<br>
pigments from the bacterial strain ABCCOOl us ilture media<br>
for the growth of bacteria. Bacterial strain produces asia a, p-carotene,<br>
canthaxanthin, a-carotene etc.<br>
The Identification Reference Paracoccus sp. ABCCOOl has been deposited   at  Microbial   Type   Culture   Collection   &amp;   Gene   Bank  on 12/08/2008 and Accession Number given by the International Depositary Authority is MTCC 5248. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Carotenoids are natural pigments that are present in living organisms in yellow, orange and red colours. Among the living organisms, carotenoids are present in plants and microorganisms like bacteria, algae and fungi. The carotenoids have two main biological functions namely light harvesting pigment in photosynthesis and protect against photo-oxidative damage.<br>
In bacteria having carotenoids, these regulate the illumination for photosynthesis. As part of the light-harvesting antenna, carotenoids can absorb photons and transfer the energy to chlorophyll, thus assisting in the harvesting of light in the range of 450 - 570 nm (Cogdell EJ and Frank HA 1987).<br><br>
Apart from Photosynthetic bacteria, a few heterotrophic bacteria also produce yellow, orange and red pigment carotenoids. Flavobacterium sp. is reported as carotenoids producing bacteria in early 70's and later it is identified as a new genera, Paracoccus sp. in the late 90's.<br>
Presently eight species are recognized within the genus Paracoccus: P. denitrificans (the type species of the genus) [van Verseveld, H. W., and A. H. Stouthamer. 1992.

Bacteriol. 46:1125-1130].<br><br>
The strain previously known as P. halodenitrificans has recently been transferred to the genus Halomonas on account of its phylogenetic affiliation [Dobson, S. J., and P. D. Franzmann. 1996. Unification of the genera Deleya (Baumann et al. 1983), Halomonas (Vreeland et al. 1980), and Halovibrio (Fendrich 1988) and the species Paracoccus denitrificans (Robinson and Gibbons 1952) into a single genus, Halomonas, and placement of the genus Zymnobacter in the family Halomonadaceae. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 46:550-558].<br>
None of the eight known members of the Paracoccus genus produces carotenoids.<br>
The US Patent 5,935,808 relates to a novel carotenoid producing bacterial species type strain DSM 11574 which produces and secretes carotenoids in vesicles and a process for production of carotenoids comprising (a) culturing a bacterial species in an nutrient medium including sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic substances; and (b) recovering an individual carotenoid pigment or a mixture of carotenoid pigments from the cells, vesicles and/or medium and process for production of carotenoids using the same. (Prior application No.08/902,518, filed in July 29, 1997 now US patent 5,935,808). This strain is identified as Paracoccus marcusii MH I<br><br>
based   on   morphological,   biological,   biochemical   assays   and determined by 16S ribosomal RNA analysis.<br>
This patent specified that the said strain DSM 11574 as a gram-negative brightly orange coccoid bacterium that appeared as a contaminant on a nutrient agar plate as isolated. The phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence comparisons showed that the bacterium so isolated should be classified as a hitherto unknown species within the genus, Paracoccus with the proposed name Paracoccus marcusii sp. This invention further provided a process for production of carotenoids using a bacterial species secreting same as vesicles to the growth medium and extraction of the carotenoids from the vesicles. The term "vesicle" as used herein in the specification refers to any substantially globular lipophillic body which is not a life form, i.e., is not capable of reproduction.<br>
It is also observed that in respect of the said species and strain, when the NaCl concentration in the process medium is increased to 6 g per liter, growth is slow, and above 8 g per liter of NaCl no growth is obtained and that Nitrate did not support anaerobic growth, and is    * not reduced to nitrite.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention elucidates a novel culture media for the production of carotenoids using bacterial species ABCCOOl which is most similar to bacteria of the Paracoccus genus based on biochemical characterization. The Identification Reference Paracoccus sp. ABCCOOl has been deposited at Microbial Type Culture Collection &amp; Gene Bank on 12/08/2008 and Accession Number given by the International Depositary Authority is MTCC 5248. The bacterial species produces carotenoids like astaxanthin, P-carotene, canthaxanthin, adinoxanthin, a-carotene etc.<br>
Eight distinct species are presently associated with the Paracoccus genus and none other than that stipulated as an agar plate contaminant in US Patent 5935808, produce carotenoids. There is however no known species of this genus isolated from soil that produces carotenoids during its life cycle.<br>
The present invention provides a novel media for production of mixed carotenoids and/or single dominant carotenoid and minor carotenoids. The bacterial species ABCCOOl accumulates both primary and secondary carotenoids simultaneously as a mixed carotenoid profile. The bacterial species ABCCOOl accumulates single dominant carotenoids such as astaxanthin, P-carotene , canthaxanthin, adinoxanthin,   a-carotene   etc.        The    single    dominant     carotenoid<br><br>
betacarotene is produced in all its isomers and astaxanthin is accumulated in its free forms only.<br>
Out of all the bacterial genera presently known, the bacterial species used in the present invention is most similar to the Paracoccus genus, based on biochemical studies. This species producing carotenoid is a local soil isolate which is similar to the bacteria Paracoccus marcusii MHl isolated as contaminant in nutrient agar plate.<br>
The bacterial species ABCCOOl used in the present invention produces carotenoid inside the cell and is not secreted out as vesicles to the growth medium. In another aspect, the present invention differ from the carotenoid producing and secreting bacterial species by the following phenotypic and biochemical characterization as follows:<br><br>
Description	P. marcusii MHl	ABCCOOl<br>
Isolation	Nutrient agar plate contaminant	Soil isolates<br>
Colony on Agar	Smooth, flat, brightly orange colored	Smooth or dry,<br>
Opaque, brightly<br>
orange colored<br>
Optimum temperature	25-30°C	28-40°C<br><br>
Growth on NaCl at 8g and above per liter	No growth	Luxuriant<br>
Nitrate reduction to nitrite	-ve	+ve<br>
Carotenoid secretion as vesicles	Yes	No<br>
The bacterial species ABCCOOl is however similar to the genus Paracoccus in that it consists of gram-negative cocci or short rods, showing a substantial metabolic versatility. Representatives are able to grow aerobically on a wide range of organic compounds.<br>
Medium for production of carotenoids using the bacterial species ABCCOOl contains a carbon source, a nitrogen source and inorganic salts necessary for the growth of producer microorganisms, as well as if necessary special required substances (for example, vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids etc.).<br>
Various carbon sources, sugars such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, trehalose, mannose, mannitol, maltose, etc., added from 2 to 20 g per 1 liter in the process medium.<br>
Various nitrogen sources of organic and inorganic nitrogen are used, like potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride,<br><br>
ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonia, urea, Sodium glutamate etc., are used alone or in combination. The concentration of the nitrogen source added is varied according to the kind of the nitrogen source, preferably 1 to 7 g per 1 liter medium.<br>
Various inorganic salts like potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, cupric sulfate, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, etc., may be used alone or in combination. The concentration of inorganic acid varies according to the kind of the inorganic salt from 0.001 to 1 g per 1 liter medium.<br>
Various complex nutrient ingredients like vitamins, nucleic acids, yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, malt extract, etc., are used in combination or alone at a concentration from 0.2 g to lOg, per 1 liter medium.<br>
