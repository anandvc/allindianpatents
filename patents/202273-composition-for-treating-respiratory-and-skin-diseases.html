				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compositions for treating allergic rhinitis and other allergic diseases. The products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, particularly the leukotrienes, can mediate bronchoconstriction, mucous secretion, airway mucosal edema, chernotaxts and mobilization of cells into the airway in the inflammatory process of asthma. Although useful, leukotriene antagonists, in and of themselves, are not capable of effectively treating the multitude of symptoms that may be associated with disease of the respiratory tract, such as season allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, common colds, sinusitus and concommittant symptoms associated with allergic asthma. The symptoms of such diseases may include sneezing, itching runny nose, nasal congestion, redness of the eye, tearing, itching of the ears or palate, and coughs associated with postnasal drip. It would be highly desirable to enhance the efficacy of such leukotriene antagonists to improve their overall efficacy.<br><br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; in admixture with<br>
ii) an effective amount of at least one antihistamine which is descarboethoxyloratidine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, ebastine, astemizole, norastemizoie, epinastine, efletirizine or a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is designed for oral adminstration. Preferably the leukotriene antagonist is monteiukast and the pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt of monoleukast is monteiukast sodium. Also preferred is that the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of monoleukast is about 10 milligrams (mg). Most preferably the antihistamine Is descarboethoxyloratidine.  Preferably, a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt of cetirizine or fexofenadine is the hydrochloride salt. Also preferred is that descarboethoxyloratidine or cetirizine is about 2.5 to about 20 mg, more preferably about 5, 7.5 or 10 mg. Preferably, fexofenadine is from about 60 to 180 mg.
