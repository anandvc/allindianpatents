				<td>Heat-resistant filter layer, filter body, and process for<br>
producing it<br>
The invention relates to a heat-resistant filter layer made<br>
from a material which is at least partially permeable to a<br>
fluid, to a filter body having at least one heat-resistant<br>
filter layer of this type, and to a process for producing a<br>
filter body of this type. These filter bodies are used in<br>
particular for the purification of exhaust gases from mobile<br>
internal combustion engines used in automotive engineering.<br>
If new vehicle registrations in Germany are considered, it<br>
will be found that in 2000 around one third of all newly<br>
registered vehicles have diesel engines. By tradition, this<br>
percentage is significantly higher than in, for example,<br>
France and Austria. This increased interest in diesel vehicles<br>
stems, for example, from the relatively low fuel consumption,<br>
the currently relatively low prices of diesel fuel, but also<br>
from the improved driving properties of vehicles of this type.<br>
A diesel vehicle is also very attractive from environmental<br>
aspects, since it has a significantly reduced emission of CO2<br>
compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. However, it should be<br>
noted that the level of soot particulates produced during<br>
combustion is well above that of gasoline-powered vehicles.<br>
If the purification of exhaust gases, in particular of diesel<br>
engines, is considered, it is possible for hydrocarbons (HC)<br>
and carbon monoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas to be oxidized in<br>
a known way by, for example, being brought into contact with a<br>
catalytically active surface. However, it is more difficult to<br>
reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) under oxygen-rich conditions. A<br>
three-way catalytic converter, as is used, for example, in<br><br>
spark-ignition engines, does not provide the desired effects.<br>
For this reason, the selective catalytic reduction (SCR)<br>
process has been developed. Furthermore, NOX adsorbers have<br>
been tested for use for the reduction of nitrogen oxides.<br>
Discussions have long been ongoing as to whether particulates<br>
or long-chain hydrocarbons have an adverse effect on human<br>
health, but to date no definitive verdict has been reached.<br>
Irrespective of this, it is clearly desirable that emissions<br>
of this nature should not be released to the environment above<br>
a certain tolerance range. In this respect, the question<br>
arises as to what filtering efficiency is actually required in<br>
order to be able to comply with the well known statutory<br>
guidelines even in the future. If current exhaust emissions<br>
from commercially available vehicles in the Federal Republic<br>
of Germany are considered, it can be concluded that most<br>
passenger automobiles certified under EU III in 1999 are also<br>
able to satisfy the requirements of EU IV if they are equipped<br>
with a filter with an efficiency of at least 30 to 40%.<br>
To reduce the levels of particulate emissions, it is known to<br>
use particulates traps which are constructed from a ceramic<br>
substrate. They have passages, so that the exhaust gas which<br>
is to be purified can flow into the particulates trap. The<br>
adjacent passages are alternately closed off, so that the<br>
exhaust gas enters the passage on the inlet side, passes<br>
through the ceramic wall and escapes again through the<br>
adjacent passage on the outlet side. Filters of this type<br>
achieve an efficiency of approx. 95% over the entire range of<br>
particulate sizes which occur.<br>
In addition to chemical interactions with additives and<br>
special coatings, the reliable regeneration of the filter in<br>
the exhaust system of an automobile still constitutes a<br><br><br>
problem. It is necessary to regenerate the particulates trap,<br>
since the increasing accumulation of particulates in the<br>
passage wall through which the gas is to flow leads to a<br>
constantly increasing pressure loss which has adverse effects<br>
on engine performance. The regeneration substantially<br>
comprises brief heating of the particulates trap and the<br>
particulates which have accumulated therein, so that the soot<br>
particulates are converted into gaseous constituents. However,<br>
this high thermal loading of the particulates trap has adverse<br>
effects on the service life.<br>
To avoid this discontinuous regeneration, which is a major<br>
factor in promoting thermally induced wear, a system for the<br>
continuous regeneration of filters has been developed (CRT:<br>
continuous regeneration trap). In a system of this type, the<br>
particulates are burnt by means of oxidation with NO2 at<br>
temperatures which are already over 200Â°C. The NO2 which is<br>
required for this purpose is often generated by an oxidation<br>
catalytic converter arranged upstream of the particulates<br>
trap. However, in particular for use in motor vehicles using<br>
diesel fuel, this gives rise to the problem that there is only<br>
an insufficient level of nitrogen monoxide (NO) which can be<br>
converted into the desired nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the<br>
exhaust gas. Consequently, it has not hitherto been possible<br>
to ensure that continuous regeneration of the particulates<br>
trap in the exhaust system will occur.<br>
Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that, in addition to<br>
non-convertible particulates, oil or additional residues of<br>
additives also accumulate in a particulates trap and cannot<br>
readily be regenerated. For this reason, known filters have to<br>
be replaced and/or washed at regular intervals. Filter systems<br>
of plate-like structure attempt to solve this problem by<br>
allowing vibration-like excitation which leads to these<br><br><br>
constituents being removed from the filter. However, this<br>
means that the non-regeneratable fraction of the particulates<br>
in some cases passes directly into the environment without any-<br>
further treatment.<br>
In addition to a minimum reaction temperature and a specific<br>
residence time, it is necessary to provide sufficient nitrogen<br>
oxide for the continuous regeneration of particulates using<br>
NO2. Tests relating to the dynamic emission of nitrogen<br>
monoxide (NO) and particulates have clearly demonstrated that<br>
the particulates are emitted in particular when there is no or<br>
only a very small amount of nitrogen monoxide in the exhaust<br>
gas, and vice versa. What this means is that a filter with<br>
true continuous regeneration substantially has to function as<br>
a compensator or store, so that it is ensured that the two<br>
reaction partners are present in the filter in the required<br>
quantities at a given instant. Furthermore, the filter is to<br>
be arranged as close as possible to the internal combustion<br>
engine in order to be able to reach temperatures which are as<br>
high as possible immediately after a cold start. To provide<br>
the required nitrogen dioxide, an oxidation catalytic<br>
converter is to be connected upstream of the filter, so as to<br>
react carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) and in<br>
particular also to convert nitrogen monoxide (NO) into<br>
nitrogen dioxide (NO2). If this system comprising oxidation<br>
catalytic converter and filter is arranged close to the<br>
engine, a suitable position is in particular upstream of a<br>
turbocharger which is often used in diesel motor vehicles to<br>
increase the boost pressure in the combustion chamber.<br>
If these basic considerations are looked at, the question<br>
arises, for actual deployment in automotive engineering, as to<br>
how a filter of this type, which in such a position and in the<br>
presence of extremely high thermal and dynamic loads has to<br><br><br>
achieve a satisfactory filtering efficiency, is constructed.<br>
In this context, account should be taken in particular of the<br>
spatial conditions, which require a new design of filters.<br>
Whereas the maximum possible volume was to the fore in the<br>
case of conventional filters, which were arranged in the<br>
underbody of a motor vehicle, in order to ensure a long<br>
residence time of the as yet unreacted particulates in the<br>
filter and therefore a high efficiency, if the filters are<br>
arranged close to the engine, there is not sufficient space or<br>
room available.<br>
For this purpose, a new concept has been developed, mainly<br>
referred to by the term "open filter system". These open<br>
filter systems are distinguished by the fact that there is no<br>
need for the filter passages to be alternately closed off by<br>
structural means. In this context, it is provided that the<br>
passage walls be constructed at least in part from porous or<br>
highly porous material and that the flow passages of the open<br>
filter have diverting or guiding structures. These internal<br>
fittings cause the flow and the particulates contained therein<br>
to be diverted toward the regions made from porous or highly<br>
porous material. Surprisingly, it has emerged that the<br>
particulates, as a result of being intercepted and/or<br>
impacting, are retained on and/or in the porous passage wall.<br>
The pressure differences in the flow profile of the flowing<br>
exhaust gas are of importance to this effect occurring. The<br>
diversion additionally makes it possible to produce local<br>
reduced pressure or excess pressure conditions, leading to a<br>
filtration effect through the porous wall, since the<br>
abovementioned pressure differences have to be compensated<br>
for.<br>
The particulate trap, unlike the known closed screen or filter<br>
systems, is open, since there are no flow blind alleys. This<br><br><br>
property can therefore also be used to characterize<br>
particulate filters of this type, so that, for example, the<br>
"freedom of flow" parameter is suitable for describing the<br>
systems. By way of example, a "freedom of flow" of 20% means<br>
that, when viewed in cross section, it is possible to see<br>
through approx. 2 0% of the surface area. In the case of a<br>
particulate filter with a passage density of approx. 600 cpsi<br>
(cells per square inch) with a hydraulic diameter of 0.8 mm,<br>
this freedom of flow would correspond to a substantially<br>
continuous area of over 0.1 mm2. To provide a better<br>
explanation, it can also be stated that a particulate filter<br>
is referred to as open if in principle particulates can fully<br>
pass through it, even particulates which are considerably<br>
larger than the particulates which are actually to be filtered<br>
out. Consequently, a filter of this type cannot become blocked<br>
even in the event of an agglomeration of particulates during<br>
operation. One suitable method for measuring the openness of<br>
the particulate filter is, for example, to test the maximum<br>
diameter of spherical particles which can still trickle<br>
through a filter of this type. In the present applications, a<br>
filter is open in particular if spheres with a diameter of<br>
greater than or equal to 0.1 mm can still trickle through,<br>
preferably spheres with a diameter of over 0.2 mm, and in<br>
particular spheres with a diameter of more than 0.3 mm.<br>
In particular with a view to realizing an open filter system<br>
of this type, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a heat-resistant filter layer which is suitable in<br>
particular for use in the context of continuous regeneration<br>
and is especially suitable for the demands which result from<br>
this application. In this respect, the filter system has to be<br>
able to withstand the high thermal and dynamic loads in the<br>
exhaust system of a passenger automobile, which stem from the<br>
pulsed emission of very hot exhaust gas. Furthermore, it is<br><br><br>
intended to provide a corresponding filter body which is<br>
suitable for significantly reducing the levels of particulates<br>
in the exhaust system. In addition, it is intended to provide<br>
a process for producing the filter body. The filter layer<br>
should be configured in such a way that the formation of<br>
connections by joining, in particular solder connections or<br>
welded connections, is promoted.<br>
These objects are achieved by a heat-resistant filter layer<br>
having the features of patent claim 1, a filter body for<br>
purifying exhaust gases from an internal combustion engine<br>
having the features of patent claim 7, and a process for<br>
producing a filter body of this type comprising the process<br>
steps described in patent claim 15. Further advantageous<br>
configurations are described in the respective dependent<br>
claims; the features disclosed therein can be employed<br>
individually or in any desired and suitable combination with<br>
one another.<br>
The heat-resistant layer is at least in part made from<br>
material which is permeable to a fluid and has at least one<br>
filter section and at least one boundary region. The filter<br>
layer according to the invention is distinguished by the fact<br>
that it has a different layer thickness in the at least one<br>
boundary region than in the at least one filter section. In<br>
this respect, the filter layer has different regions which<br>
each have different functions. Whereas the filter section<br>
serves primarily to filter out the particulates or the like<br>
contained in the exhaust gas and to at least temporarily store<br>
or accumulate them in cavities, pores or the like or on the<br>
filter material, the at least one boundary region serves to<br>
form connections by joining. Designing the filter layer to<br>
have different layer thicknesses in these regions creates a<br>
clearly apparent spatial boundary, so that assembly errors<br><br><br>
relating, for example, to the manufacture of a filter body<br>
which has such a filter layer are avoided.<br>
With regard to the spatial arrangement of the at least one<br>
boundary region and of the at least one filter section with<br>
respect to the filter layer, it should be noted that the<br>
filter section is preferably arranged in a central region of<br>
the filter layer. The at least one boundary region is<br>
preferably formed at least close to an edge, although under<br>
certain circumstances it is also possible for the boundary<br>
region to be formed all the way around the filter section,<br>
like a frame. In this respect, it is possible to form a<br>
relatively large-area, centrally arranged filter section which<br>
is surrounded by at least one boundary region; as an<br>
alternative, it may under certain circumstances, however, also<br>
be appropriate for a plurality of filter sections to be<br>
provided, so that they are each delimited by at least one<br>
boundary region (in particular designed in a similar manner to<br>
a frame), so as to resemble a chessboard pattern. The<br>
configuration of the heat-resistant filter layer with a<br>
plurality of filter sections which are each surrounded by at<br>
least one boundary region allows relatively strong connections<br>
to be made within a corresponding filter body, since<br>
connecting adjacent filter layers in the plurality of boundary<br>
regions, which are also arranged in central regions of the<br>
filter layer, creates an areal, uniformly distributed<br>
attachment.<br>
According to a further configuration of the filter layer, the<br>
layer thickness in the at least one boundary region is less<br>
than in the at least one filter section, in particular less<br>
than 60%, preferably less than 50% or even less than 35%.<br>
Configuring the filter layer in this way has the advantage<br>
that a larger volume is provided in the at least one filter<br><br>
section, which is designed with a greater wall thickness. The<br>
result of this is that sufficient pores, cavities or the like<br>
are provided in this at least one filter section, these pores,<br>
cavities or the like being used to accommodate or store, for<br>
example, soot particulates. In this case, with large pores of<br>
this type, in particular particulates with a diameter of from<br>
100 ran to 250 run are accumulated. The heat-resistant filter<br>
layer is preferably made from a fiber material which, for<br>
example, forms a relatively loose assembly of fibers. This<br>
assembly of fibers may, for example, be a woven or knitted<br>
fiber fabric formed from ceramic fibers, but as an alternative<br>
or in addition it is also possible to use metal fibers,<br>
sintered materials, wire fabrics or the like.<br>
The at least one boundary region substantially comprises the<br>
same material as the at least one filter section, preferably<br>
comprising a compressed or compacted fiber assembly. Whereas a<br>
fluid, in particular an exhaust-gas stream, can flow through<br>
the filter material in the region of the at least one filter<br>
section, the at least one boundary region is preferably<br>
substantially impervious to a fluid. This means that at least<br>
partial compacting of the fiber material of this nature has<br>
been performed and that a large number of cavities, openings,<br>
pores, apertures or the like have been closed up. In this<br>
respect, the reduced layer thickness is the consequence of the<br>
filter material being compressed.<br>
The impervious nature of the filter material in the at least<br>
one boundary region means that, for example, connecting<br>
material or additional material (solder, welding additives or<br>
the like) can be applied in targeted fashion to the surface in<br>
the at least one boundary region, while preventing the joining<br>
agent or welding additives from accumulating in the interior<br>
of the fiber material when they are heated, so that they would<br><br><br>
not be available for joining adjacent filter layers. Depending<br>
on the joining agents which are required to form connections<br>
by joining, suitable compression is to be carried out, so that<br>
the layer thickness is reduced in the at least one boundary<br>
region, advantageously by at least 40%, in particular at least<br>
50% or even by more than 65%. This results, in the at least<br>
one boundary region, in layer thicknesses of less than 1 mm,<br>
in particular less than 0.5 mm and even less than 0.1 mm.<br>
According to a further configuration, the at least one<br>
boundary region, starting from an edge of the filter layer,<br>
has a boundary width of at most 30 mm, in particular of at<br>
most 20 mm, preferably of at most 10 mm or even of only at<br>
most 5 mm. This means that in particular the edge region of<br>
the filter layer is used to form connections by joining. This<br>
is particularly advantageous since it is particularly these<br>
regions which are subjected to particular loads in view of the<br>
pulsating flow of exhaust gas. Designing the filter layer to<br>
have a relatively strongly compressed filter material in this<br>
edge region prevents detachment phenomena, since the assembly<br>
of fibers is significantly stronger there. Moreover, the<br>
adjacent filter layers in a corresponding filter body are<br>
connected to one another in this edge region, with the result<br>
that vibration or flapping of these regions is also avoided.<br>
The boundary width is to be designed in particular with a view<br>
to the dynamic loads which occur in use; account should also<br>
be taken of the thermal expansion characteristics of the<br>
filter layer. In this respect, it is advantageous to select<br>
boundary regions which are as narrow as possible if the filter<br>
layer is exposed to moderate dynamic loads and moderate to<br>
high thermal loads.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the filter layer comprise at<br>
least one fiber layer, which preferably has a fiber layer<br><br><br>
thickness of at most 3 mm, in particular of at most 1 mm and<br>
preferably of at most 0.5 mm. The fiber layer thickness is to<br>
be selected in particular taking account of the exhaust-gas<br>
stream which is to be purified and/or the particulates<br>
contained therein. Furthermore, it should be noted that a<br>
greater fiber layer thickness provides a greater storage<br>
volume and/or an increased number of fibers, and consequently<br>
filter layers of this type do not have to be regenerated as<br>
frequently, and consequently can be fitted even in areas which<br>
are remote from the engine, such as for example in the<br>
underbody of an automobile. In positions which are remote from<br>
the engine of this nature, the exhaust gas only reaches the<br>
temperature required for regeneration after a relatively long<br>
period of time, and consequently sufficient storage capacity<br>
for this period of time has to be provided. If it is desirable<br>
for the filter layer to be arranged in very hot areas of an<br>
exhaust system, in particular close to the engine, possibly<br>
even continuous regeneration may be ensured, and consequently<br>
in this case it is preferable to use filter layers with a very<br>
small fiber layer thickness.<br>
An advantageous refinement of the filter layer comprises at<br>
least one metal layer, which preferably delimits the filter<br>
layer on the outside and in particular has a thickness of at<br>
most 0.05 mm, preferably of at most 0.03 mm or even of at most<br>
just 0.015 mm. A fluid can preferably penetrate through this<br>
metal layer in the at least one filter section, i.e. this<br>
metal layer preferably has openings, apertures or the like.<br>
The metal layer preferably extends as far as or over the at<br>
least one boundary region, in which case the metal layer in<br>
the at least one boundary region is advantageously configured<br>
so as to be impervious to a fluid. Suitable materials for a<br>
metal layer of this type are in particular aluminum-chromium<br>
alloys, as are already known from the production of metallic<br><br><br>
honeycomb bodies as catalyst supports for the purification of<br>
exhaust gases. The metal layer may in this case be formed as a<br>
coating or as a separate foil.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for the filter layer to be a<br>
sandwich structure and to have at least one fiber layer and at<br>
least one metal layer. In this case, the metal layer<br>
preferably forms a sleeve which surrounds the fiber layer, so<br>
that the fiber layer is arranged captively inside the at least<br>
one metal layer. In this context, the term sleeve is to be<br>
understood as meaning an arrangement of the at least one metal<br>
layer in which the at least one metal layer also extends at<br>
least in part beyond the periphery of the fiber layer, in<br>
particular completely surrounds the fiber layer. In this<br>
respect, at least in part, a sleeve is formed over the entire<br>
periphery of the fiber layer. Accordingly, the metal layer<br>
surrounding the periphery of the fiber layer in this way leads<br>
to a relative movement of the fiber layer with respect to the<br>
at least one metal layer being impeded in a positively locking<br>
manner in at least one direction.<br>
The formation of a sandwich structure of this type combines a<br>
number of advantages which are of significance in particular<br>
with a view to a filter layer of this type being arranged<br>
close to the engine. The at least one metal layer forms a type<br>
of protective sleeve which protects the interior fiber layer<br>
from the pressure shocks and temperature peaks which occur.<br>
The fiber layer represents a significantly looser assembly of<br>
fibers than the metal layer. The fiber layer may in this case<br>
have a very high porosity, since the presence of a metal layer<br>
protecting it means that it does not have to be designed<br>
primarily for strength. In this respect, it is possible in<br>
particular to realize large free spaces, pores or the like in<br>
the fiber layer. This is boosted in particular by the fact<br><br><br>
that the at least one metal layer is constructed in a form<br>
similar to a strip or sheet, i.e. offers a relatively large<br>
bearing surface area. Consequently, in this case it is<br>
possible to use fiber materials which are packed significantly<br>
more loosely than, for example, with known wire meshes which<br>
have hitherto been used to ensure the dimensional stability of<br>
the filter layers.<br>
Since then, sandwich structures of this type have been<br>
designed in such a way that there is in each case one<br>
supporting structure arranged on both sides of the filter<br>
material (in particular braided wire fabrics), and this<br>
sandwich has then been bent or deformed into the desired<br>
shape. These sandwich structures have been arranged in the<br>
exhaust-gas stream in such a way that the periphery (or end<br>
face) of the filter material was exposed to the pulsating<br>
exhaust-gas stream without protection. This led to detachment<br>
phenomena in particular in these end regions. To ensure that<br>
the fiber material is fixed between the wire fabrics for a<br>
prolonged period of time, this sandwich structure had to be<br>
pressed together under a high pressure, over a large area (in<br>
some cases even over the entire surface area) which, on<br>
account of the resultant very small pores or free spaces for<br>
the accumulation of particulates, had noticeable adverse<br>
effects on the efficiency of the filter material and led to an<br>
undesirably high pressure loss across the filter. This is<br>
avoided in a simple way in the filter assembly according to<br>
the invention, since the fact that the at least one covering<br>
layer engages around the periphery of the fiber layer means<br>
that the fiber layer is arranged captively in the interior.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a filter body for<br>
purifying exhaust gases from an internal combustion engine,<br>
which comprises at least partially structured layers which are<br><br><br>
stacked and/or wound in such a way as to form passages through<br>
which an exhaust gas can flow. The filter body according to<br>
the invention has at least one heat-resistant filter layer as<br>
described above. The filter body can be constructed in<br>
accordance with conventional principles, such that the<br>
passages are alternately closed off, with the result that the<br>
entire flow of exhaust gas flows through the heat-resistant<br>
filter layer. However, it is preferable to use a configuration<br>
of the filter body in accordance with the "open system"<br>
described in the introduction, i.e. with a freedom of flow of<br>
at least 20%, in particular at least 40% or even of over 50%.<br>
This means that the open filter body has cross sections<br>
through which medium can flow freely over the entire length of<br>
the passages, with means for generating pressure differences<br>
and/or means for influencing the direction of flow in the<br>
passage being provided within the passages. This causes the<br>
exhaust gas which is to be purified to be at least partially<br>
diverted toward the heat-resistant filter layer, to at least<br>
partially penetrate through the filter layer and thereby to<br>
cause particulates to accumulate and/or be stored in the<br>
filter material.<br>
The configuration of the filter body with layers which<br>
comprise at least one structured sheet-metal foil and at least<br>
one substantially smooth or unstructured filter layer is<br>
particularly preferred, the layers being connected to one<br>
another by joining, in particular by soldering or welding, in<br>
at least one connecting section. This means that the at least<br>
one structured sheet-metal foil and the at least one filter<br>
layer are stacked and/or wound, with passages being formed as<br>
a result of the structure of the sheet-metal foil, which in<br>
principle functions as a spacer between adjacent smooth filter<br>
layers. These passages preferably run substantially parallel<br>
to one another. To ensure that a relative movement of the<br><br><br>
layers of the filter body is substantially avoided even under<br>
high thermal and dynamic loads, these layers are to be<br>
connected to one another by joining. In particular solder<br>
joints or welded joints, as are already known from the<br>
production of metallic honeycomb bodies as catalyst supports<br>
in automotive engineering, are suitable for this purpose.<br>
In this context, it is particularly advantageous for the at<br>
least one connecting section to be arranged in the at least<br>
one boundary region of the filter layer. This means, for<br>
example, that the connecting section is preferably to be<br>
designed to be smaller than if it covered the entire extent of<br>
the filter layer. This is advantageous because in the present<br>
case two different materials (sheet-metal foil and filter<br>
layer) are being connected to one another, these materials<br>
having different coefficients of thermal expansion. Connecting<br>
these adjacent components in just a relatively small<br>
connecting section ensures that this expansion is not<br>
significantly impeded as a result of the components being<br>
connected to one another. This has particularly beneficial<br>
effects on the service life of a filter body of this type,<br>
since the probability of cracks forming in the vicinity of the<br>
connecting section is significantly reduced. A spatially<br>
coinciding arrangement of the at least one connecting section<br>
and the at least one boundary region leads to particularly<br>
durable connections, since the filter layer is impervious to<br>
the joining agent (solder or welding material) in the boundary<br>
region, and consequently this material continues to be made<br>
available even while the connection by joining is being formed<br>
in the contact region between the components which are to be<br>
connected to one another.<br>
In view of the fact that the heat-resistant filter layer<br>
according to the invention is designed with different layer<br><br><br>
thicknesses, it is particularly advantageous for there to be<br>
means for compensating for the different layer thicknesses of<br>
the filter layer in the filter body. When an adjacent<br>
component is brought to bear against the filter layer<br>
according to the invention, the components bear against one<br>
another in a substantially positively locking manner in the<br>
region of the at least one filter section. Since, by way of<br>
example, the sheet-metal foils have a substantially planar<br>
bearing surface, but the filter layer according to the<br>
invention forms a shoulder at the transition from the at least<br>
one filter section to the at least one boundary region, a type<br>
of gap would form between the sheet-metal foil and the filter<br>
layer in the at least one boundary region. The size of the gap<br>
would be such that solder or welding material alone would<br>
often be unable to bridge it. In this respect, there is a need<br>
for means for compensating for this gap, which ensure contact<br>
between adjacent components of the filter body even in the at<br>
least one boundary region of the filter layer. The following<br>
text will explain, by way of example, a number of different<br>
compensation means.<br>
If the layer thickness of the filter layer is reduced in the<br>
at least one boundary region compared to the at least one<br>
filter section, it is proposed that the at least one boundary<br>
region have a deformation region which at least partially<br>
overlaps itself and is preferably even soldered together. This<br>
means that the at least one boundary region, which is in<br>
particular arranged close to at least one edge of the filter<br>
layer, is designed with a greater boundary width than a<br>
connecting section is subsequently to generate. That part of<br>
the boundary region which projects beyond the connecting<br>
section is then bent over, folded, creased or the like in such<br>
a way that these projecting regions project back into the<br>
connecting section. Consequently, partial regions of the<br><br><br>
boundary region lie adjacent to one another, preferably even<br>
bear against one another, so that the layer thickness is at<br>
Least doubled at least in parts of the at least one boundary<br>
region. This is recommended, for example, for filter layers<br>
which have a layer thickness in the at least one boundary<br>
region which amounts to substantially just 50% of the layer<br>
thickness in the at least one filter section. Therefore,<br>
during the deformation of the at least one boundary region, a<br>
substantially planar bearing surface for adjacent components<br>
of the filter body is provided at least on one side of the<br>
filter layer. To prevent this deformed or bent-over partial<br>
region of the at least one boundary region from starting to<br>
flap or vibrate as a result of the dynamic loads in an exhaust<br>
system of an automobile, or even becoming detached from the<br>
filter layer, it is particularly advantageous for the<br>
overlapping part of the boundary region, which preferably<br>
bears against the boundary region itself, also to be welded or<br>
soldered to itself. In terms of a welding process, the roller<br>
seam welding process has proven particularly suitable.<br>
According to an advantageous refinement, it is proposed that,<br>
in the case of a design of the filter layer with a reduced<br>
layer thickness in the at least one boundary region, that zone<br>
of a layer, in particular of a structured sheet-metal foil,<br>
which is arranged adjacent to the at least one boundary region<br>
has a height which is greater than a (its) remaining zone. If<br>
the adjacent layer is a structured sheet-metal foil, it is<br>
particularly advantageous for this to be formed in the zone<br>
with a structure height which is greater than that of the<br>
remaining zone, with a material thickness of the sheet-metal<br>
foil preferably being equal in the various zones. Contrary to<br>
the principle described above, according to which the<br>
different layer thicknesses are compensated for by the filter<br>
layer itself, in this case it is proposed that the<br><br><br>
compensation be carried out by means of components arranged<br>
adjacent to the filter layer.<br>
As has already been explained, the structure of the sheet-<br>
metal foil serves primarily as a spacer for the adjacent<br>
filter layers. Accordingly, in the case of a configuration of<br>
the filter layers with different structure heights, different<br>
distances between the adjacent filter layers are also bridged.<br>
In the case of the structure height being designed to be<br>
larger in the zone arranged adjacent to the at least one<br>
boundary region compared to the remaining zone arranged<br>
adjacent to the filter section, it is ensured that the sheet-<br>
metal foil is in contact with adjacent filter layers over the<br>
entire length of the passages, with the result that it becomes<br>
possible for these components to be connected to one another<br>
by joining (in particular in the at least one boundary region.<br>
Accordingly, the structure height is to be increased by a<br>
similar percentage as a reduction in the layer thickness at<br>
the transition from the at least one filter section to the at<br>
least one boundary region.<br>
According to yet a further configuration, the filter body is<br>
provided with at least one additional compensation layer,<br>
which is preferably arranged adjacent to the at least one<br>
boundary region of the filter layer with a reduced layer<br>
thickness. Consequently, these additional compensation layers<br>
do not extend over the entire length of the filter body, but<br>
rather preferably only substantially over the connecting<br>
section in which the adjacent components of the filter body<br>
are connected to one another. In this case, the compensation<br>
layer substantially fills the gap which has been produced as a<br>
result of the reduced layer thickness of the filter layer in<br>
the at least one boundary region, and is preferably likewise<br>
connected to the adjacent components by joining, in particular<br><br><br>
by soldering. Under certain circumstances, it is also possible<br>
for the additional compensation layer to be designed to be<br>
longer than the at least one boundary region, in which case it<br>
at least partially projects beyond the filter layer or the at<br>
least one sheet-metal foil. This projecting subregion may if<br>
appropriate also be arranged around a boundary region of the<br>
filter layer, so that two gaps which are formed with respect<br>
to a boundary region of the filter layer in the vicinity of<br>
the edge can be compensated for using one compensation layer.<br>
In this way, the edges of the filter layer, which are exposed<br>
to particularly high dynamic loads, are provided with further<br>
protection, with the number of additional compensation layers<br>
which are to be integrated in the filter body being reduced.<br>
A further aspect of the invention proposes a process for<br>
producing a filter body as described above, which comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
- production of at least one heat-resistant filter layers-<br>
- formation of at least one boundary region of the at least<br>
one filter layer of reduced layer thickness;<br>
- provision of means for compensating for the different layer<br>
thicknesses of the at least one filter layer;<br>
- stacking and/or winding of at least one filter layer and at<br>
least one structured sheet-metal foil so as to form a<br>
honeycomb body with passages through which an exhaust gas can<br>
flow;<br>
- supplying solder in at least one connecting section between<br>
the at least one filter layer and the at least one sheet-metal<br>
foil; and<br>
- heating of the honeycomb body in order to form solder<br>
joints in the at least one connecting section.<br><br><br>
With regard to the formation of solder joints, reference is<br>
made to the known techniques used for the production of<br>
metallic honeycomb bodies as catalyst support bodies for<br>
mobile exhaust systems of automobiles. In this respect, it is<br>
preferable for nickel-based solders in powder form to be used<br>
as solder, with the heating of the honeycomb body preferably<br>
being carried out in a protective gas atmosphere or a<br>
virtually complete vacuum.<br>
According to a further configuration of the process, the<br>
honeycomb body is introduced into a casing before the solder<br>
is supplied, with the solder, while it is being supplied, also<br>
adhering in at least one attachment region for attaching the<br>
at least one filter layer and/or the at least one sheet-metal<br>
foil to the casing, so that solder joints are likewise<br>
generated during heating in the at least one attachment<br>
region. For this purpose, in a known way the connecting<br>
section and the attachment region are first of all provided<br>
with a bonding agent to which the pulverulent solder adheres<br>
during the operation of applying the solder. It is also known<br>
to use means which limit the flow of solder (solder stop, oil,<br>
wax, ceramic coating or the like) to delimit the connecting<br>
section and/or the attachment region, and these means may also<br>
be employed here. The introduction of the honeycomb body into<br>
a casing prior to the application of solder means that it is<br>
possible to avoid a plurality of solder-application steps and<br>
to produce uniform solder joints, since these joints are<br>
exposed to the same degree of thermal treatment.<br>
According to a refinement of the process, the at least one<br>
boundary region of reduced layer thickness is formed by the<br>
application of a compressive force to the filter layer in the<br>
at least one boundary region. This compressive force can be<br>
produced, for example, by means of a roller or the like, with<br><br><br>
this roller pressing the filter layer onto a die or the like,<br>
so that primarily the filter material is compacted. In this<br>
context, it is also possible for this compressive force to be<br>
exerted, for example, in parallel during a welding process.<br>
If, for example, a configuration of the filter layer with a<br>
deformed boundary region is selected, the filter layer can<br>
first of all be deformed in the boundary region, and then<br>
compacted and, at the same time, welded together by means of<br>
the roller seam welding process.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that the compensation means be<br>
produced by the deformation of the at least one boundary<br>
region of the filter layer. This means has already been<br>
described in more detail above, and a further, more detailed<br>
description is given in connection with Fig. 5.<br>
According to yet a further configuration of the process, the<br>
compensation means are produced by at least one compensation<br>
layer being arranged between a filter layer and an adjacent<br>
foil. This process step has already been explained above and<br>
is to be described in more detail below with reference to Fig.<br>
5.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail on the<br>
basis of the figures, which show particularly advantageous and<br>
particularly preferred configurations of the heat-resistant<br>
filter layer according to the invention and of the filter<br>
body. Furthermore, the figures serve to illustrate the process<br>
according to the invention which is described. Nevertheless,<br>
it should be noted at this point that the invention is not<br>
restricted to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the<br>
figures.<br>

configuration of the process according to the invention for<br>
producing a filter body.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of an<br>
embodiment of the filter layer 1 according to the invention,<br>
through which a fluid can flow at least in a filter section 2<br>
(as indicated by the direction of flow 35) . The filter layer 1<br>
is at least in part constructed from a porous material (cf.<br>
dotted filter region 2) and has two boundary regions 3 in the<br><br><br>
vicinity of opposite edges 5. The boundary regions 3 have been<br>
compressed by a compressive force 29 (indicated by the<br>
arrows), and consequently have a reduced layer thickness 4<br>
compared to the filter section 2. The compression is signaled<br>
by the pores or cavities illustrated in section, which are<br>
significantly smaller in the boundary region 3 than in the<br>
filter section 2.<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a sectional view through a<br>
further embodiment of a filter layer 1, which is designed as a<br>
sandwich structure 11, the filter layer 1 having two metal<br>
layers 9 which form a sleeve around a fiber layer 7. The metal<br>
layers 9 each have two boundary regions 3, with the metal<br>
layers 9 being connected to one another by joining in the<br>
boundary regions 3. The connection by joining is in this case<br>
ensured by means of a solder 26, with a solder stop 30 being<br>
provided outside the boundary region 3, preventing the solder<br>
26 from reaching the vicinity of the fiber layer 7 during a<br>
heat treatment. The boundary region 3 extends from an edge 5<br>
of the metal layer 9 over a boundary width 6 of preferably<br>
between 3 and 15 mm. With regard to the material thicknesses,<br>
it can be explained with reference to Fig. 2 that the metal<br>
layers 9 are designed, for example, as metal foils and have a<br>
thickness 10 of less than 0.04 mm. Furthermore, it can be seen<br>
that the fiber layer 7 has a fiber layer thickness 8 which is<br>
preferably in the range from 0.01 mm to 1 mm.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a metal layer 7 which is provided with flow-<br>
guiding surfaces 41. This is designed in particular as a<br>
microstructure. In the embodiment illustrated, this<br>
microstructure or the flow-guiding surfaces 41 fulfils or<br>
fulfil two functions. Firstly, the exhaust gas which flows by<br>
is diverted or swirled up, so that partial gas streams are<br>
diverted toward or penetrate through the adjacent porous wall,<br><br><br>
in particular a filter layer according to the invention.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen that with a microstructure of this<br>
type it is also possible to effect a clamping action with<br>
respect to the inner fiber layer 7. This improves the<br>
stability of the fiber layer 1. Moreover, this enables the<br>
porosity of the metal layers 9 to be increased, since the<br>
clamping forces which are additionally introduced already<br>
sufficiently prevent any possible detachment phenomena in the<br>
fiber layer 7. The filter layer 1, which in Fig. 2 is designed<br>
as a sandwich structure 11, has two layer thicknesses 4, 4',<br>
with the layer thickness 4 in the region of the boundary<br>
region 3 being significantly thinner than the layer thickness<br>
4' in the region of the filter section 2. This figure<br>
illustrates a particular embodiment, since the fiber layer 7<br>
does not extend into the boundary regions 3.<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts the structure of an exhaust<br>
system 36 for an internal combustion engine 13. An internal<br>
combustion engine 13 of this type is preferably designed as a<br>
diesel engine. In the direction of flow 35 of the exhaust gas,<br>
the exhaust system 36 comprises the following components:<br>
- an upstream oxidation catalytic converter 31,<br>
- a filter body 12 according to the invention,<br>
- a turbocharger 32, and<br>
- a further catalytic converter 34.<br><br>
The individual components may be arranged in separate casings<br>
or may be partially combined with one another in a single<br>
casing, and are connected to one another via an exhaust pipe<br>
33. As has already been stated in the introduction, it is<br>
particularly advantageous for the filter body 12 to be<br>
arranged as close as possible to the internal combustion<br>
engine. A distance 37 from the internal combustion engine 13<br>
of less than 0.7m, in particular even less than 3 0 cm, is<br>
particularly suitable in this respect. With the individual<br><br>
components arranged in this way, first of all a sufficient<br>
quantity of nitrogen dioxide is made available with the aid of<br>
the oxidation catalytic converter 31, ensuring (continuous)<br>
regeneration of the accumulated soot particulates in the<br>
filter body 12 arranged immediately downstream. The downstream<br>
catalytic converter 34 may, for example, also be designed as a<br>
hybrid converter, in which case it has partial regions with<br>
different heat capacities. In this context, it is to be<br>
designed in such a way that its heat capacity increases in the<br>
direction of flow.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a diagrammatic and perspective illustration of a<br>
further embodiment of the filter body 12 according to the<br>
invention. The filter body 12 in this case comprises sheet-<br>
metal foils 15, between which there is in each case one filter<br>
layer 1 according to the invention. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated, the filter layer 1 is formed with two metal<br>
layers 9 and a fiber layer 7 arranged between them; the<br>
connection by joining in the boundary region cannot be seen on<br>
account of the sectional illustration. In the excerpt<br>
illustrated here, the filter layer 1 is illustrated only in<br>
the filter section 2, and consequently in this figure also<br>
only the layer thickness 4' is visible.<br>
The sheet-metal foils 15 have a constant material thickness 22<br>
and are in this case provided with a structure, while the<br>
filter layer 1 has a substantially smooth surface. This<br>
structure of the sheet-metal foils 15 helps to form passages<br>
14 through which an exhaust gas can flow in a direction of<br>
flow 35. The sheet-metal foils 15 in this case have different<br>
heights 20 of the structure, so that the passages 14 which are<br>
formed are matched to the characteristics of the incoming flow<br>
of exhaust gas. The embodiment illustrated here substantially<br>
shows a detail of an open filter body. This property is<br><br><br>
described by the fact that there is a freedom of flow of at<br>
least 20%. In this context, the term freedom of flow means<br>
that in any desired cross section it is possible to see<br>
through at least 20% of the area, i.e. at least 20% of the<br>
area is free of internal fittings, such as diverting surfaces<br>
39 or the like. In other words, this also means that when a<br>
particulate filter of this type is viewed from the end side,<br>
it is possible to see through at least some of the passages,<br>
provided that the internal fittings are all in approximately<br>
the same installation position, i.e. are arranged aligned one<br>
behind the other. This is typically the case with honeycomb<br>
bodies made from at least partially structured sheet-metal<br>
layers. However, the freedom of flow, in the case of internal<br>
fittings which are not aligned with one another, does not<br>
necessarily mean that it is actually possible to see through<br>
part of a honeycomb body of this type. The sheet-metal foils<br>
15 are provided with apertures 38 and diverting surfaces 39<br>
which divert the exhaust-gas stream toward the filter assembly<br>
1. This produces pressure differences which cause partial<br>
flows of exhaust gas to penetrate through the filter layer 1,<br>
so that soot particulates or the like remain and accumulate in<br>
the fiber layer 7.<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts a detailed view of a further<br>
embodiment of the filter body 12, in which a filter layer 1<br>
according to the invention is arranged between two sheet-metal<br>
foils 15. The filter layer 1 once again has two layer<br>
thicknesses 4, 4' with the layer thickness 4 in the boundary<br>
region 3 being designed to be thinner than in the filter<br>
section 2. In a connecting section 16, the sheet-metal layers<br>
15 are connected, in particular soldered (using solder 26), to<br>
the filter layer 1 directly or via a compensation layer 23,<br>
which in this case is additionally arranged in the boundary<br>
region 3 or the connecting region 16. In this case, the sheet-<br><br><br>
metal foils 15, the compensation layer 23 and the filter layer<br>
1 end flush at their end sides. The thin boundary region 3 of<br>
the filter layer 1 shown is substantially designed to be twice<br>
as long as the connecting section 16, with a deformation<br>
region 17 having been formed, so that the boundary region 3 at<br>
least partially overlaps itself. The overlapping partial<br>
regions of the edge region 3 now bear against one another and<br>
are even soldered together.<br>
On account of the fact that the layer thickness 4 in the<br>
embodiment illustrated corresponds to approximately 1/3 of the<br>
layer thickness 4' in the filter section, bending over or<br>
folding the boundary region 3 allows the filter layer 1 to be<br>
connected directly to the adjacent sheet-metal layer 15 at<br>
least on one side. In this respect, the boundary region 3 now<br>
fills up 2/3 of the layer thickness 4', so that the additional<br>
compensation layer 23 now bridges the remaining third and<br>
there is then an indirect connection between the filter layer<br>
1 and the opposite sheet-metal foil 15. As an alternative to<br>
an embodiment of this type, it is also possible for the<br>
(undeformed) boundary region 3 to be indirectly connected to<br>
the adjacent sheet-metal foils 15 on both sides by means of a<br>
compensation layer 23, in which case the compensation layer 23<br>
is preferably designed with a deformation region, so that this<br>
deformation region projects around the end-side end of the<br>
boundary region 3, so that a single compensation layer 23<br>
simultaneously fills up both distances between the boundary<br>
region 3 and the sheet-metal foils 15.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of an<br>
embodiment of a sheet-metal foil 15 for compensating for the<br>
different layer thicknesses 4, 4' of the filter layer 1 (not<br>
shown). The structured sheet-metal layer 15 is arranged<br>
adjacent to the filter layer 1, in the manner which has<br><br><br>
already been explained, and is used to compensate for the<br>
different layer thicknesses thereof. For this purpose, the<br>
sheet-metal foil 15, in the zone 18, has a structure height 21<br>
which is greater than that of the remaining zone 19, with a<br>
material thickness 22 (not shown) of the sheet-metal foil 15<br>
preferably being equal in the various zones 18, 19.<br>
Accordingly, the magnitude of the structure height 21 of the<br>
zone 18 is to be increased in such a way that contact of the<br>
metal foil 15 is ensured in the zone 18 or the boundary region<br>
3 of the filter layer 1. For example, if the starting point<br>
used is an embodiment of the filter layer 1 as shown in Fig.<br>
5, it is advantageous for the structure height 21 in the zone<br>
18 to be greater than the structure height 21' by an amount<br>
which substantially corresponds to the difference between the<br>
layer thickness 4' and the layer thickness 4. In this case, it<br>
is advantageously possible to dispense with the need for<br>
additional compensation layers.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a diagrammatic and perspective view of an<br>
embodiment of the filter body 12 which comprises a honeycomb<br>
body 2 4 arranged in a casing 27. The honeycomb body 24 is<br>
formed with a plurality of alternately arranged filter layers<br>
1 and structured sheet-metal foils 15, which are first of all<br>
stacked and then wound together in such a way as to produce a<br>
substantially cylindrical configuration of the honeycomb body<br>
24. As an alternative, it is also possible to produce conical,<br>
rectangular or oval configurations, and it is also possible in<br>
each case to provide just one sheet-metal foil 15 and one<br>
filter layer 1, which in particular are wound up together in<br>
helical form. The structured sheet-metal foils 15 and the<br>
filter layers 1 delimit passages 14 through which an exhaust<br>
gas can flow and which extend from one end face 2 5 to the<br>
opposite end face 25. This ensures that it is possible to at<br>
least partially see through these passages 14. This is ensured<br><br><br>
with the freedom of flow of at least 20% as explained in the<br>
introduction.<br>
The structured sheet-metal foils 15 and the filter layers 1<br>
are connected to one another by joining, in particular<br>
soldering (preferably high-temperature vacuum soldering), in a<br>
connecting section 16. In addition, the honeycomb body 24 is<br>
attached to the casing 27 in at least one attachment region<br>
28; in this context, it is preferable for the same joining<br>
process to be used (at the same time) as for the connection of<br>
the sheet-metal foils 15 and the filter layers 1 to one<br>
another. The attachment and the connections are not performed<br>
over the entire length 42 of the honeycomb body, with the<br>
result that even under thermal load differential expansions<br>
resulting from the different coefficients of thermal expansion<br>
of the components are possible. The result of this is that no<br>
stresses which would lead to premature loss of the structural<br>
integrity of the filter body are produced in the honeycomb<br>
body 24 or between honeycomb body 24 and casing 27.<br>
Fig. 8 diagrammatically depicts the sequence of one<br>
configuration of the process according to the invention for<br>
producing a filter body 12. This process comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
a) Production of at least one heat-resistant filter layer 1:<br>
According to step 1, the filter layer 1 is produced by a<br>
central fiber layer 7 being assigned two metal layers 9 which<br>
delimit the fiber layer 7 with respect to the outside, so that<br>
a type of protective sleeve is formed (cf. sandwich<br>
structure). The filter layer 1 is preferably produced from<br>
strip-like or sheet-like raw materials (metal sheets, fabrics,<br>
etc.), by these materials being cut to the desired dimensions.<br><br><br>
b) Forming at least one boundary region 3 of the at least one<br>
filter layer 1 of reduced layer thickness 4:<br>
The two opposite boundary regions 3 with reduced layer<br>
thicknesses 4 are formed by the application of a compressive<br>
force 29 to the filter layer 1 (cf. step 1: indicated by<br>
arrows) in the boundary regions 3. This significantly<br>
compresses at least the fiber layer, so that these boundary<br>
regions 3 become substantially impervious to a solder (cf.<br>
step 2). Numerous production processes are suitable for such a<br>
compression process; in this context, pressing using a roller<br>
may be mentioned by way of example.<br>
c) Providing means for compensating for the different layer<br>
thicknesses 4, 4' of the at least one filter layer 1:<br>
As has been explained above, substantially two different<br>
principles, or alternatively a combination of these<br>
principles, are suitable for this purpose. In the<br>
configuration illustrated in step 3, the different layer<br>
thicknesses 4, 4' of the at least one filter layer 1 are<br>
compensated for exclusively by means of the layers arranged<br>
between the filter layers 1. Accordingly, the sheet-metal foil<br>
15 has a plurality of end-side zones with a height 20 which is<br>
designed to be greater than the height 20' in - the central or<br>
intervening remaining zone. In this respect, the adjacent<br>
layers bear against one another over the entire length, so<br>
that relative movement of the layers with respect to one<br>
another is avoided even after connections by joining have been<br>
formed (examples of such movements include flapping or<br>
vibrating of the boundary regions of the filter layers 1).<br><br><br>
d) Stacking and/or winding at least one filter layer 1 and at<br>
least one structured sheet-metal foil 15 to form a honeycomb<br>
body 24 with passages 14 through which an exhaust gas can<br>
flow.<br>
The sheet-metal foils 15 and the filter layers 1 are then<br>
stacked in the manner illustrated in step 3 and then shaped<br>
into a cylindrical honeycomb body 24. The boundary regions are<br>
at least in part to be arranged in a plane which is parallel<br>
to an end face 25 of the honeycomb body 24, and in particular<br>
all the boundary regions adjoin at least one end face 25. The<br>
structure of the sheet-metal foils 15 leads to the formation<br>
of passages 14 through which an exhaust gas can flow, ensuring<br>
a freedom of flow of at least 20%. With regard to the winding<br>
process, reference should also be made to known techniques<br>
which are already in widespread use for the production of a<br>
metallic honeycomb structure as a catalyst support body. The<br>
honeycomb body 24 is then also introduced into a casing 27<br>
(cf. step 4), so that the honeycomb body 24 and the casing 27<br>
can then together be provided with a bonding agent and/or the<br>
solder 26.<br>
e) Supplying solder 26 in at least one connecting section 16<br>
connecting the at least one filter layer 1 to the at least one<br>
sheet-metal foil 15:<br>
For this process step too, reference should be made to the<br>
known technique for applying solder to metallic honeycomb<br>
structures which are used, for example, as catalyst support<br>
bodies in exhaust systems for automobiles. In addition to the<br>
use of solid strips of solder or the like, in this context it<br>
is also preferable to use solders in powder form. In this<br>
case, first of all a bonding agent is applied in the contact<br>
regions between the layers which are to be connected to one<br><br><br>
another, with a filter body 12 which has been pretreated in<br>
this way then being brought into contact with the pulverulent<br>
solder 26, which adheres to the bonding agent (cf. step 5) .<br>
f) Heating the honeycomb body 24 in order to form solder<br>
joints in the at least one connecting section 16:<br>
To form corrosion-resistant and temperature-resistant<br>
connections between the layers (connecting section 16) and to<br>
attach them to the casing 27 (attachment region 28), it has<br>
proven particularly expedient to use a high-temperature vacuum<br>
process. In this case, the filter body 12 is heated in vacuo<br>
in a furnace 40 at temperatures of up to 1200Â°C and is then<br>
cooled again. The heating and cooling process usually takes<br>
place in accordance with a specifiable pattern which can be<br>
described using temperature transients and holding times.<br>
The filter body 12 produced in this way satisfies the very<br>
high thermal and dynamic requirements, for example in exhaust<br>
systems of diesel engines as are currently used in automotive<br>
engineering. This applies in particular with a view to the<br>
filter body being arranged close to the engine, in which case<br>
the filter body can be regenerated continuously. This<br>
configuration of the open filter body causes the reaction<br>
partners for converting the soot particulates and the soot<br>
particulates themselves to dwell in the filter body for a<br>
longer period of time, so that the probability of all the<br>
required reaction partners and ambient conditions being<br>
present is increased. Tests have confirmed this, demonstrating<br>
a filter efficiency of, for example, over 50%. This means that<br>
most passenger automobiles which are currently in use will<br>
continue to be able to comply with the most stringent exhaust<br>
emission guidelines and/or statutory regulations even in the<br><br><br>
future. In this respect, this filter body is particularly-<br>
suitable for retrofitting.<br><br><br>
