				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention pertains to energy integrated processes for making detergent<br>
range alkylbenzenes, and particularly to such processes using a solid, acidic catalyst for benzene alkylation. In the processes of this invention, benzene from the regeneration of the solid, acidic catalyst for benzene alkylation is used as a feed to a transalkylation of heavies co-produced during the benzene alkylation.<br>
[0002]	Alkylation of benzene with olefin of 8 to 16 carbon atoms produces<br>
alkylbenzenes that may find various commercial uses, e g, alkylbenzenes can be sulfonated<br>
to produce detergents   As used herein, alkylbenzenes refers to phenylalkanes wherein the<br>
alkane group has between 8 and 16 carbon atoms  Alkylbenzenes are produced as a<br>
commodity product in large-scale facilities, e g often in amounts of 50,000 to 200,000 metnc<br>
tonnes per year per plant  In the alkylation process, benzene is reacted with an olefin the<br>
desired length to produce the sought alkylbenzene   The alkylation conditions compose the<br>
presence of homogeneous or heterogeneous alkylation catalyst such as aluminum chloride,<br>
hydrogen fluoride, silica alumina or zeolitic catalysts and elevated temperature<br>
[0003]	The alkylbenzene must meet stringent product specifications to be<br>
commercially acceptable   For instance, alkylbenzenes, to be desirable for making sulfonated surfactants, must be capable of providing a sulfonated product of suitable clarity, biodegradability and efficacy  The benzene content of the alkylbenzene product should be relatively free from benzenes, e g., less than 1 part per million by weight (ppmw). and often less than 0 5 ppmw  Also, desirable alkylbenzene products are relatively free, e g, less than 50, preferably less than 5, ppmw, from byproducts such as dialkylbenzenes, oligomers of olefins, and the like (herein referred to as "heavies")  Additional considerations for commercial alkylbenzene products include the 2-phenyl content and linearity of the alkyl substituent   With respect to efficacy, alkylbenzenes having higher 2-phenyl contents are desired as they tend, when sulfonated, to provide surfactants having better detergency but less solubility if the 2-phenyl content becomes too high  Thus alkylbenzenes having a 2-phenyl isomer content in the range from 25 to 40 percent are particularly desired<br>
 [0004]	The catalysts are not selective and other reactions of olefins can occur to<br>
produce heavies, i e . dimers and dialkylaryl compounds  Also, skeletal isomenzation of the olefin can occur, resulting in a loss of selectivity to the sought alkylbenzene   The formation of dialkylaryl compounds is particularly problematic as the reaction approaches complete conversion of the olefin and the concentration of the alkylbenzene has thus increased thereby increasing the likelihood that an olefin molecule will react with an alkylbenzene molecule rather than benzene   Accordingly, typical processes use a large excess of benzene to reduce the molar ratio of the sought alkylbenzene to the olefin in the reactor  For homogeneous hydrogen fluoride catalyzed processes, the benzene to olefin ratio is generally in the range of 6 1 to 8 1. Solid catalysts are prone to generate more heavies  Hence, for these solid catalysts the mole ratio of benzene to olefin is typically greater than 15 1   For making alkylbenzenes with reduced skeletal isomenzation, the benzene to olefin ratio is often in excess of 20 1 and sometimes as much as 30 1<br>
{0005]	As the ratio of benzene to olefin increases, additional process costs are also<br>
incurred in the recovery and recycling of the unreacted benzene in the alkylation product The refining system for alkylbenzene production is summarized in Pujado, Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB) Manufacture, Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes, Second Edition, pp 1 53 to 1 66 (1996), especially pages 1 56 to 1 60  Especially for large-scale, commercial alkylation processes such as are used for the production of linear alkylbenzenes, capital and operating costs can be very important, and the addition of additional distillation steps can thus be undesirable   Of the distillations effected in the alkylbenzene refining system, the benzene distillation requires the highest heat duty<br>
[0006]	Transalkylation of heavies from the alkylation of benzenes using solid<br>
catalysts has been proposed  However, the transalkylation requires benzene and, for purposes of regeneration, benzene is the preferred regenerant. Typically better catalyst performance is obtained with higher ratios of benzene to dialkylbenzene m the heavies being transalkylated Often the mole ratios of benzene to dialkylbenzene are greater than 20 1   Accordingly, a transalkylation unit operation will be a significant consumer of benzene   Hence, the benzene distillation would have to produce incremental benzene for the transalkylation   This incremental production requires both a distillation assembly of sufficient size and additional reboiler duty  Transalkylation is not practiced in commercial complexes to make detergent range alkylbenzenes  Transalkylation has found application in making other alkylaromatics<br>
having low molecular weight substituents such as xylenes, ethylbenzene, and the like   But<br>
the refining systems and product quality issues differ from those in making alkylbenzenes<br>
[0007J	In addition to being a reactant to make alkylbenzenes, benzene is also<br>
commonly used for other purposes in an alkylbenzene production complex   For instance, benzene is used for regeneration of solid, acidic alkylation catalysts. Where the olefin-containmg feedstock is denved from the dehydrogenation of paraffins, it is often treated with a solid sorbent to remove impurities, especially aromatics, and benzene is used as a regenerant  Proposals have been made to use benzene from the regeneration of solid, acidic alkylation catalyst for regenerating solid sorbent<br>
[0008]	A desire exists for an integrated alkylbenzene production facility that can<br>
employ a transalkylation unit operation in an economically viable manner to enhance production of alkylbenzenes<br>
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DISCLOSURES<br>
[0009]	The use of alkylation and transalkylation unit operations in the preparation of<br>
monoalkylated aromatics is well known  Often such processes have been particularly<br>
suggested for making ethylbenzene and cumene although broader disclosures have been<br>
made   See, for instance, US 4,870,222, column 1, lines 30 to 34<br>
[0010]	Specific suggestions for transalkylating heavies made in the alkylation of<br>
benzenes for detergent range alkylbenzenes include Ganeshpure, et al, Transalkylation of Benzenes with Heavy Alkylbenzenes, Consisting of Dialkylbenzenes and Diphenylalkanes (C10-C14 alkyl chains) Catalysed by Nafion-H, Indian Journal of Technology, Vol 31, July 1993, pp 503-506   Radici, et al, in US 5,574,198 disclose a process for producing linear alkylbenzenes using an aluminum chloride catalyst  At column 3, lines 35 to 40, the patentees indicate that the heterogeneous catalytic phase makes possible a transalkylation of polyalkylated species.<br>
[0011]	Travers, et al, in US 2003/0040653 disclose the use of a heteropolyacid<br>
catalyst for alkylation   At paragraph 0023 the applicants provide for the recycle of at least a portion of a fourth fraction from the alkylation product, which fraction contains polyalkylbenzerc      the reacnon zone so as to be at least partially transalkylated  They also<br>
contemplate a separate transalkylation zone containing a different catalyst   See paragraph<br>
0025<br>
[0012]	Euzen, et al, in US 2005/0177017 disclose the use of a catalyst based on<br>
silicated alumina for alkylation. At paragraph 0219 the applicants provide for the recycle of<br>
at least a portion of a fourth fraction from the alkylation product, which fraction contains<br>
polyalkylbenzene, to the reaction zone so as to be at least partially transalkylated  They also<br>
contemplate a separate transalkylation zone containing a different catalyst   See paragraph<br>
0225<br>
[0013]	Euzen, et al, in US 2006/0224030 disclose the use of a catalyst based on<br>
silica-alumma for alkylation. At paragraph 0237 the applicants provide for the recycle of at<br>
least a portion of a fourth fraction from the alkylation product, which fraction contains<br>
polyalkylbenzene, to the reaction zone so as to be at least partially transalkylated  They also<br>
contemplate a separate transalkylation zone containing a different catalyst   See paragraph<br>
0243<br>
[0014]	Bozzano, et al, in US 6,740,789 and US 6,979,394, disclose the use of<br>
benzene that is spent from the regeneration of alkylation catalyst for further use in an<br>
alkylbenzene complex, such as for regenerating selective sorbent used to treat the olefin-<br>
containing feed and recycle to the alkylation reactor<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]	By this invention, processes are provided for enhancing the production of<br>
alkylbenzene of detergent range having desirable product quality through the integrated use of a transalkylation unit operation while still achieving low energy consumption   In the processes of this invention spent benzene from regeneration of solid, acidic catalyst for the alkylation of benzene is used as at least 50 mass percent, and preferably between 80 and essentially all, of the benzene supplied to the transalkylation unit operation   Often, the amount of benzene used for regeneration of alkylation catalyst is between 20 and 25 percent of the total benzene from the benzene distillation   Accordingly, ample benzene from the regeneration of the catalyst is available to maintain a high ratio of benzene to dialkvlbenzene in the transalkylation unit<br>
 [0016]	In accordance with the broad aspects, the continuous, integrated processes of<br>
this invention for prepanng linear alkylbenzenes by the alkylation of benzene with olefin having between 8 and 16 carbon atoms, said olefin being contained in admixture with paraffin, in the presence of regenerable, solid, acid alkylation catalyst comprise<br>
a.	continuously supplying benzene and a mixture of said olefin and paraffin to at<br>
least one alkylation zone of at least two alkylation zones, said alkylation zone being at<br>
alkylation conditions including the presence of a catalyticaJly effective amount of said<br>
catalyst to provide an alkylation product containing alkylbenzene, dialkylbenzenes<br>
and unreacted benzene, wherein said alkylation deactivates said catalyst,<br>
b	separating benzene from the alkylation product to provide a benzene-nch<br>
fraction, at least a portion of which is recycled to step (a) and a substantially benzene-<br>
free fraction, said fraction containing alkylbenzene, paraffin and dialkylbenzene,<br>
c	separating paraffin from said substantially benzene-free fraction to provide a<br>
paraffin-rich fraction and a substantially paraffin-free fraction containing alkylbenzene and dialkylbenzenes;<br>
d	separating alkylbenzene from said paraffin-free fraction to provide an<br>
alkylbenzene fraction and a heavies fraction containing dialkylbenzenes,<br>
e	periodically regenerating said catalyst in at least one of said alkylation zones<br>
by continuously passing through said zone benzene under regeneration conditions to<br>
provide a spent benzene-containing regeneration stream,<br>
f	subjecting at least a portion of the heavies fraction to transalkylation<br>
conditions comprising the presence of a catalytically effective amount of solid transalkylation catalyst and benzene, at least 50 mass percent, and preferably between 80 and essentially all, of which is derived from the spent benzene-containing stream, to provide a transalkylation product containing alkylbenzene and unreacted benzene, and<br>
g	passing the transalkylation product to step (b)<br>
[0017]	In a preferred aspect of the processes of this invention, the mole ratio of<br>
benzene to olefin supplied to step (a) is sufficiently low that dialkylbenzene to total alkylbenzene and dialkylbenzene in the alkylation product is greater than 5, and sometimes in the range of between 6 and 10, mass percent  Often the mole ratio of benzene to olefin supplied to step (a) is between 6 1 to 30 1, most preferably between 8.1 to 25 1, and<br>
sometimes between 10 1 and 20 1   At the lower benzene to olefin mole ratios, further advantages exist even though more dialkylbenzene will be co-produced at lower ratios than at higher ratios  Not only will a portion of the dialkylbenzene be converted to alkylbenzene product to maintain desirable alkylbenzene production rates, but also the amount of benzene needed to be distilled in the refining system is reduced because of the lower ratio and because benzene for the transalkylation is derived from spent benzene from regenerating alkylation catalyst<br>
[0018]	In preferred embodiments of the processes of this invention, the mole ratio of<br>
benzene to total alkylbenzene and dialkylbenzene (Bz.TAB) in the heavies fed to the<br>
transalkylation of step (f) is between 2 1 to 100 1 and preferably between 20 1 to 80 1   At<br>
the higher mole ratios, transalkylation catalyst stabilities tend to improve<br>
[0019]	The processes of this invention may use all or a portion of the spent benzene-<br>
containing regeneration stream as feed for transalkylation  Where a portion of the spent benzene-containing stream is used, it may be an aliquot portion or may be taken from select stages of the regeneration process   In one preferred embodiment, the regeneration of step (e) produces a spent benzene-containing stream having a varying degree of impurities, and the portion of the benzene from the spent benzene-containing stream used for step (f) is that containing a lesser degree of impurities  The spent benzene-containing stream may also be subjected to purification conditions prior to being introduced into step (f) as a feed for transalkylation   For instance, if the spent benzene-containing stream contains olefin purged from the catalyst being regenerated, a clay treatment may be use<br>
[0020]	While the processes of this invention are continuous, it is within the scope of<br>
this invention to operate the transalkylation of step (f) in a semicontinuous or continuous manner  For instance, the heavies fraction from step (d) may be allowed to accumulate and the transalkylation of step (0 conducted in a batch mode   In a semicontinuous mode, the transalkylation product may be passed immediately to step (b) or may be allowed to accumulate to provide a relatively constant flow of transalkylation product to step (b)<br>

[0027]	The 2-phenyl content of an alkylbenzene is the mass percent of the<br>

DETAILED DISCUSSION<br>
[0028]	Various processes have been proposed for the alkylation of benzene  See, for<br>
instance, Pujado, Linear Alkylbenzene (LAB) Manufacture, Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes, Second Edition, pp I 53 to 1 66 (1996)   One type of process uses a solid acidic catalyst involving contacting an olefin with a stoichiometric excess of benzene at elevated<br>
temperature to produce alkylbenzene  The reaction product stream will contain, in addition<br>
to alkylbenzene, benzene, some unreacted olefin, and reaction byproducts such as<br>
dialkylbenzene and oligomers and polymers of the olefin  For commercial processes, the<br>
feedstocks may include other components as well   For instance, the olefin may be obtained<br>
by the dehydrogenation of a paraffinic feedstock and thus contain significant amounts of<br>
paraffin<br>
The Olefin-containing Feedstock<br>
[0029]	Olefin-containing aliphatic compound and benzene are used for the alkylation<br>
process  The selection of the olefin is dependent upon the sought alkylation product  The olefin-containing aliphatic compound is preferably has between 8 and 16, and for detergent applications 9 to 14, carbon atoms  The olefin-containing aliphatic compound is an acyclic, mono-olefinic compound. The positioning of the olefinic bond in the molecule is not critical as most alkylation catalysts have been found to promote migration of the olefinic bond However, the branching of the hydrocarbon backbone is often more of a concern as the structural configuration of the alkyl group on the alkylbenzene product can affect performance especially in surfactant applications and for biodegradation properties  For instance, where alkylbenzenes are sulfonated to produce surfactants, undue branching can adversely affect the biodegradabihty of the surfactant  On the other hand, some branching may be desired such as the lightly branched modified alkylbenzenes such as described in US 6,187,981   The olefin may be unbranched or lightly branched, which as used herein, refers to an olefin having three or four primary carbon atoms and for which none of the remaining carbon atoms are quaternary carbon atoms A primary carbon atom is a carbon atom which, although perhaps bonded also to other atoms besides carbon, is bonded to only one carbon atom A quaternary carbon atom is a carbon atom that is bonded to four other carbon atoms   Although branched, these alkylbenzenes have been characterized by their 2-phenyl content, see for instance, US 6,589,927.<br>
[0030]	The olefin-containing aliphatic compound is usually a mixture of two or more<br>
olefins   For commercial processes, the feedstocks may include other components as well such as aromatics, lighter mono-olefins, diolefins, paraffins, halogenated hydrocarbons, and oxygenated hydrocarbons such as aldehydes, ethers, esters and carboxyhc acids   For instance, the olefin may be obtained by the dehydrogenation of a paraffinic feedstock and<br>
thus contain paraffin   Of course, other olefin synthesis procedures such as dehydration of alcohols and dechlorination, can provide the olefin-contaimng feedstock   Feedstocks from such sources may have little, if any, paraffin<br>
[0031]	The paraffin is inert in the alkylation reaction but it can serve an important<br>
function as a heat sink as the alkylation reaction is exothermic   Where lower benzene to olefin feed ratios are used, the importance of paraffins as heat sinks to adsorb the heat of the alkylation reaction, becomes more important Nevertheless, in the broad aspects of the processes of this invention, the olefin may be in any concentration in the feedstock including substantially pure. Often, however, the feedstock comprises at least 5 or 10 mole percent olefin   Especially where the feedstock is from the catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin, the olefin is usually in an amount of 5 to 30, and more frequently 9 to 20, mass-percent of the feedstock<br>
[0032]	Where the olefin is obtained by the dehydrogenation of paraffin, the source of<br>
the paraffinic feedstock is not critical although certain sources of paraffinic feedstocks will likely result in the impurities being present  Conventionally, kerosene fractions produced in petroleum refineries either by crude oil fractionation or by conversion processes therefore form suitable feed mixture precursors   Fractions recovered from crude oil by fractionation will typically require hydrotreatmg for removal of sulfur and/or nitrogen prior to being fed to the subject process The boiling point range of the kerosene fraction can be adjusted by fractionation to adjust the carbon number range of the paraffins In an extreme case the boiling point range can be limited such that only paraffins of a single carbon number predominate Kerosene fractions contain a very large number of different hydrocarbons and the feed mixture to the subject process can therefore contain 200 or more different compounds<br>
[0033]	The paraffinic feedstock may be at least in part derived from ohgomerization<br>
or alkylation reactions Such feed mixture preparation methods are inherently imprecise and produce a mixture of compounds The feed mixtures to the process may contain quantities of paraffins having multiple branches and paraffins having multiple carbon atoms in the branches, cycloparaffins, branched cycloparaffins, or other compounds having boiling points relatively close to the desired compound isomer The feed mixtures to the process of this invention can also contain aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
 [0034]	Another source of paraffins is in condensate from gas wells   Usually<br>
insufficient quantities of such condensate are available to be the exclusive source of paraffinic feedstock  However, its use to supplement other paraffinic feedstocks can be desirable   Typically these condensates contain sulfur compounds, which have restricted their use in the past   As this invention enables the use of sulfur-containing feeds, these condensates can be used to supply paraffins for alkylation<br>
[0035]	Paraffins may also be produced from synthesis gas (Syngas), hydrogen and<br>
carbon monoxide  This process is generally referred to as the Fischer-Tropsch process Syngas may be made from various raw materials including natural gas and coal, thus making it an attractive source of paraffinic feedstock where petroleum distillates are not available The Fischer-Tropsch process is a catalytic process conducted under elevated temperature and pressure. The reaction is temperature sensitive, and temperature control is essential to achieve a desired hydrocarbon product  The products from the Fischer-Tropsch process include not only paraffins but also monoolefins, diolefins, aromatics and oxygenates such as alcohols, ethers, aldehydes and ketones, and thus are normally treated to eliminate oxygenates<br>
[0036]	The olefin-containing feedstock should be sufficiently free of impurities that<br>
can unduly adversely affect the life of the alkylation catalyst and that can adversely affect the quality of the alkylbenzene product  The dehydrogenation of paraffins will result in a product containing aromatics, herein referred to as aromatic by-products. The aromatic byproducts can compnse substituted phenyl compounds such as toluene, xylenes, and higher methylated benzenes, ethylbenzene, diethylbenzene, and tnethylbenzenes, isopropylbenzene (cumene), n-propylbenzene, and higher propylbenzenes. butylbenzenes. and pentylbenzenes and the like, biphenyl compounds and substituted biphenyl compounds, and fused ring compounds and substituted fused nng compounds such as napthalenes, mdanes, tetralins, and the like   Where the feedstocks are used to make alky 1 benzenes and a paraffin-containing stream is generated during the purification of the alkylbenzenes and is recycled to the dehydrogenation, the feedstocks may also contain alkylbenzenes. In many instances, the aromatic by-products have the same carbon number as the mono-olefins  The concentration of the aromatic by-products can vary widely, e g, from 0 3 to 10 mass-percent based upon the mass of the feedstock<br>
 [0037]	Advantageously at least a portion of the aromatic by-products in the mono-<br>
olefin-containing feedstock is removed using at least one aromatics removal zone   An aromatics removal zone may be placed in one or more locations   For instance, where the feedstock is obtained from a catalytic dehydrogenation including a seiectn e diolefin hydrogenation zone, the aromatic by-products may be selectively removed before or after the selective hydrogenation.<br>
[0038]	Suitable aromatics removal zones for this embodiment of the invention include<br>
sorptive separation zones   Sorptive separation zones include fixed bed or moving or fluidized sorbent bed systems, but the fixed bed system is preferred  The sorbent may be installed in one or more vessels and in either series or parallel flow The flow of the feedstock containing the aromatic by-products through the sorptive separation zones is preferably performed in a parallel manner so that one or more sorption beds can be undergoing regeneration while one or more beds are removing aromatic by-products<br>
[0039]	Suitable sorbents may be selected from materials which exhibit the primary<br>
requirement of selectivity for the aromatic by-products and which are otherwise convenient to use Suitable sorbents include, for example, molecular sieves, silica, activated carbon activated charcoal, activated alumina, silica-alumina, clay, cellulose acetate, synthetic magnesium silicate, macroporous magnesium silicate, and/or macroporous polystyrene gel It should be understood that the above-mentioned sorbents are not necessarily equivalent in their effectiveness The choice of sorbent will depend on several considerations including the capacity of the sorbent to retain aromatic by-products, the selectivity of the sorbent to retain the aromatic by-products which are more detrimental to solid alkylation catalysts, and the cost of the sorbent The preferred sorbent is a molecular sieve, and the preferred molecular sieve is 13 X zeolite (sodium zeolite X)<br>
[0040]	Those skilled m the art are able to select the appropriate conditions for<br>
operation of the sorbent without undue experimentation For example, a fixed bed sorptive separation zone containing 13 X zeolite may be maintained at a temperature generally from 20°C to 300°C, and preferably from 100°C to 200°C, a pressure effective to maintain the stream containing the aromatic by-products in a liquid phase at the chosen temperature, and a liquid hourly space velocity from 1 hr-1 to 10 hr-1 and preferably from I hr-1 to 3 hi -1   The flow of the feedstock through a fixed or moving sorption bed may be conducted in an upflow, downflow or radial-flow manner<br>
 [0041]	Although both liquid and vapor phase operations can be used in many sorptive<br>
separation processes, liquid phase operation is preferred for the sorptive separation zone<br>
because of the lower temperature requirements and because of the higher sorption yields of<br>
the aromatic by-products that can be obtained with liquid phase operation over those obtained<br>
with vapor phase operation   Therefore, the temperature and pressure of the sorptive<br>
separation are preferably selected to maintain the feedstock in a liquid phase   The resulting<br>
unsorbed stream having a reduced concentration of aromatic by-products is a desorption<br>
effluent  However, the operating conditions of a sorptive separation zone can be optimized<br>
by those skilled in the art to operate over wide ranges which are expected to include the<br>
conditions in the reaction zones of the invention and its variants Therefore, a sorptive<br>
separation zone may be contained in a common reaction vessel with the dehydrogenation<br>
zone, the selective diolefin hydrogenation zone, or the selective alkylation zone<br>
[0042]	A sorbent bed is periodically subjected to regeneration conditions   A benzene-<br>
containing stream is use for the regeneration  Generally it is preferred that the benzene be highly pure to avoid undue sorption of any impurities on the sorbent during regeneration Nevertheless, the regenerant may contain components that do not matenally interfere with the regeneration and are acceptable in the sorption effluent   For integrated processes where the sorption effluent is used as a feed to a benzene alkylation reactor and benzene from the refining system is used as regenerant, to prevent undue buildup of paraffins in the regeneration effluent distillation system, the regenerant should contain less than 0 1 mass-percent paraffins, more preferably less than 100 mppm (mass part per million) paraffins Typically the regenerant contains at least 50, preferably at least 90 or 99, more preferably to at least 99 5, to essentially 100, mass-percent benzene   A purge may be intermittently or continuously withdrawn from at least one point in the recycle loop consisting of the sorber assembly and the regeneration effluent distillation system in order to avoid excessive concentrations of paraffins   Where the sorption effluent is used as a feed to an alkylation reactor to make alkylbenzene, the regenerant is conveniently a pure benzene stream from the refining of the alkylbenzene-containing reaction effluent  Any suitable regeneration method may be used, including altenng the temperature and pressure of the sorbent and treating with liquid or vaporous or mixed phase regenerant to displace or desorb aromatic by-products<br>
 [0043]	The spent benzene from the regeneration of the sorbent may be recycled to the<br>
alkylbenzene refining system or may be treated as disclosed in copending US 11/313071. filed December 20, 2005, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety<br>
The Alkylation<br>
[0044]	In the alkylation step, benzene and olefin feedstock are reacted under<br>
alkylation conditions to provide an alkylbenzene product  Alkylation conditions include the presence of a solid, acidic catalyst  The alkylation conditions selected will affect the nature of the alkylbenzene product as well as the conversion and selectivity to alkylbenzenes   For instance, higher alkylation temperatures can reduce the linearity of the alkylbenzene product and the type of catalyst can affect the 2-phenyl content of the alkylbenzene product  The benzene to olefin mole ratio is a major determinant of the extent of heavies generated during the alkylation<br>
[0045]	Alkylation conditions generally include a temperature in the range between<br>
80°C and 200°C, most usually at a temperature not exceeding 175°C   Since the alkylation is<br>
typically conducted in at least partial liquid phase, and preferably in either an all-liquid phase<br>
or at supercritical conditions, pressures must be sufficient to maintain benzene as a liquid<br>
The requisite pressure necessanly depends upon the temperature, but normally is in the range<br>
of 1300 to 7000 kPa(g), and most usually between 2000 and 3500 kPa(g)   Preferably the<br>
alkylation conditions do not result in substantial skeletal isomenzation of the olefin   For<br>
instance, less than 15 mole percent, and preferably less than 10 mole percent, of the olefin,<br>
the aliphatic alkyl chain, and any reaction intermediate undergoes skeletal isomenzation<br>
[0046]	Any suitable alkylation catalyst may be used in the present invention, provided<br>
that the requirements for conversion, selectivity, and activity are met  Alkylation catalysts comprise zeolites having a zeolite structure type selected from the group consisting of FAU. BEA, MOR, MTW, and NES Such zeolites include mordenite, ZSM-4, ZSM-12, ZSM-20, ZSM-38, MCM-22, MCM-36, MCM-49, UZM-8, offreUte, gmelinite, zeolite Y, NU-87. and gottardite  Another class of acidic, solid catalyst components are acidified refractory oxides such as chlonded, fluonded, or sulfated alumina, gallia, bona, molybdia, ytterbia, titania. chromia, silica, zirconia, and the like and combinations thereof Clays and amorphous catalysts may also find utility   Further discussion of alkylation catalysts can be found in US 5,196,574, US 6,315,964 and US 6,617,481<br>
 [0047J	The catalyst may contain suitable binder or matrix material such as inorganic<br>
oxides and other suitable materials   The relative proportion of molecular sieve or other catalytically active component in the catalyst may range from 10 to 99 mass-percent, with 20 to 90 mass-percent being preferred   A refractory binder or matrix can be used to facilitate fabrication of the catalyst, provide strength and reduce fabrication costs The binder should be uniform in composition and relatively refractory to the conditions used in the process Suitable binders include inorganic oxides such as one or more of alumina, magnesia, zirconia. chromia, titania, bona and silica The catalyst also may contain, without so limiting the composite, one or more of (1) other inorganic oxides including, but not limited to, beryllia, germama, vanadia, tin oxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide and cobalt oxide, (2) non-zeolitic molecular sieves, such as the aluminophosphates of US 4,310,440, the sihcoaluminophosphates of US 4,440,871 and ELAPSOs of US 4,793,984. and (3) spinels such as MgAl2CU, FeAl2O4, Z11AI2O4, CaAhOa, and other like compounds having the formula MO—AI2O3 where M is a metal having a valence of 2, which components can be added to the composite at any suitable point<br>
[0048]	Alkylation of benzene by the olefins is conducted in a continuous manner, 1 e ,<br>
both the benzene and the olefin-containing feedstock are continuously introduced into the<br>
alkylation zone containing the catalyst bed   For purposes herein, a catalyst bed is termed a<br>
reactor whether in the same or a separate vessel from another bed  The catalyst may be used<br>
as a packed bed or a fluidized bed  The feed to the reaction zone may be passed either<br>
upflow or downflow, or even horizontally as in a radial bed reactor  In one desirable variant,<br>
olefin-containing feedstock may be fed into several discrete points within the reaction zone<br>
[0049]	One or more alkylation zones can be used  The alkylation zones may be<br>
configured in parallel with the same or different catalyst in each  Alkylation zones may also<br>
be configured in series, especially with a portion of the olefin-containing feedstock being fed<br>
to two or more alkylation zones  The benzene may be fed to the first reaction zone thereby<br>
providing a high benzene to olefin ratio in that zone, and the alkylation product is then fed.<br>
with additional olefin-containing feedstock to a subsequent reaction zone   Often 3 reactors<br>
are used to achieve an advantageous combination of performance and capital expense<br>
avoidance with one alkylation reaction zone being off-line for regeneration<br>
[0050]	Where a low benzene to olefin ratio is used, there is less benzene to adsorb the<br>
heat of the alkylation reaction   As higher alkylation temperatures can result in loss of<br>
linearity of the alkylbenzene product can occur, It may.be .desired to use a plurality of alkylation zones with cooling there between  For instance, benzene and a portion of the olefin feedstock at a first blend temperature can be passed to a first zone where the mass ratio of benzene to olefin feedstock is sufficient that the temperature of the first zone effluent is less man 15°C, preferably less than 12°C, and most preferably less than 10°C, above the blend temperature, the first zone effluent is cooled and combined with another portion of the aliphatic feedstock at a second blend temperature  This mixture is passed to a second reaction zone to produce a second zone effluent comprising alkylbenzene and the mass ratio of benzene to olefin feedstock is sufficient that the temperature of the second zone effluent is less than 15°C, preferably less than 12°C, and most preferably less than 10°C, above the blend temperature  This technique can be repeated a sufficient number of times to use the olefin feedstock<br>
[0051J	The cooling of each zone effluent may be by direct or indirect heat exchange,<br>
and is preferably at least partially effected by direct heat exchange with the portion of the olefin feedstock being passed to the zone, the olefin feedstock being provided at a cooler temperature than the preceding zone effluent  The cooling is often sufficient to reduce the temperature increased expenenced in the previous reaction zone by at least 60 percent, and preferably the temperature reduction is at least to that of the blend temperature of the previous reaction zone.<br>
[0052]	A trim reaction zone containing solid alkylation catalyst can be used in any<br>
alkylation reaction scheme  The trim reaction zone does not receive any portion of the<br>
aliphatic feedstock but rather is maintained under liquid phase alkylation conditions sufficient<br>
to consume substantially all olefin contained in the zone effluent from the last of me zones<br>
[0053J	Another technique is to remove at least a portion of the alkylbenzene between<br>
alkylation zones to reduce the production of dialkylbenzenes   The separation may be by any convenient means including membrane separation, selective sorption and distillation  In one technique a lights distillation is used to recover a portion of the unreacted benzene contained in the effluent from an alkylation reaction zone  The benzene is recycled to the alkylation zone, and the remaining portion of the unreacted aromatic compound is recovered in a subsequent distillation  The column size and energy requirements for the subsequent distillation are thus reduced   Because the lights distillation need not provide a relatively pure aromatic stream, the energy requirements and size of the lights distillation can be<br>
commercially viable   Often, the lights distillation is effected using less than 5 theoretical distillation trays, especially a flash distillation  Thus, the overhead can contain appreciable amounts of alkyibenzene product as well as paraffins, if paraffins are present in the alkylation reactor effluent   Although arylalkane can be reacted to produce heavies under alkylation conditions, the processes of this invention can still provide an alkylation reaction effluent without an undue amount of heavies   Advantageously, the distillation is conducted at a lower pressure than the alkylation zone, and is often at between 80 and 250 kPa absolute such that a significant portion of the aromatic compound in the at least a portion of the effluent fed to the first distillation zone, is vaporized<br>
Catalyst regenerations<br>
[0054]	During use, the catalyst becomes deactivated  This deactivation is<br>
substantially reversible and thus the catalyst can be regenerated   Without intending to be limited to theory, it is believed that a significant portion of the deactivation occurs through the deposit of deactivating components on the catalyst and in its pore structure  Hence, when using two or more selective alkylation reactors, at least one is on-stream where alkylation occurs and at least one off-stream where catalyst regeneration takes place   Regeneration is effected by contacting the catalyst in the off-stream reactor with a stream comprising benzene<br>
[0055]	After a reactor has been taken off-stream but before catalyst regeneration<br>
begins, the catalyst is typically purged, or flushed, to remove at least some of the unreacted<br>
monoolefins, paraffins, and alkyibenzene from the void volume of the now off-stream<br>
reactor  The purging conditions are not critical and may be any conditions that are effective<br>
for at least partially purging the void volume of the alkylation catalyst  Preferably the off-<br>
stream reactor purging conditions comprise at least a partial liquid phase<br>
[0056]	The contacting conditions for purging the catalyst in the off-stream reactor can<br>
be the same throughout the off-stream reactor purging, although some changes could be made The purging can be started by simply stopping the flow of the olefinic feed stream to the on-stream reactor, thereby taking the on-stream reactor off-stream   The contacting temperature is preferably low enough that the deactivating components on the catalyst are not removed   The temperature is usually between 120°C and 170°C   The duration of the purge step can vary widely   The purging need not be complete pnor to entering the subsequent step<br>
of ramping the temperature up to a suitable regeneration temperature  Often, the duration of the purge step will be determined by the use of the benzene from the purge step and by the cycle time for regeneration that is available   See, for instance, US 6,740,789, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety<br>
[0057]	After purging, catalyst regeneration can begin The catalyst regeneration<br>
conditions are not critical to the success of this invention The regeneration conditions can be any conditions that are effective for at least partially reactivating the alkylation catalyst Although olefins may contact the catalyst bed during regeneration, preferably no olefins contact or pass to the catalyst during regeneration Preferably the regeneration conditions comprise at least a partial liquid phase<br>
[0058J	The contacting conditions can be the same throughout the regeneration, but<br>
typically some changes in conditions are made Commonly, the contacting temperature is changed during regeneration<br>
[0059]	Typically a heating stage is used to increase the temperature to that suitable<br>
for regeneration  Generally, the temperature is raised by from 50°C to 200°C above the<br>
temperature of the purging  Typically the regeneration is conducted at a temperature between<br>
200°C and the critical temperature of benzene, and preferably between 220°C and 270°C<br>
The temperature may be ramped up steadily or can be increased step-wise with temperature<br>
holds  Any suitable method may be used to raise the temperature One method is heating the<br>
benzene by indirect heat exchange and then passing it into the reactor<br>
[0060]	As the temperature increases, the benzene-containing stream begins to remove<br>
deactivating components that accumulated on the surface of the catalyst and block reaction sites  Since some of the components are gum-like materials that have some color (i e , are color bodies), the presence of these materials in the regeneration effluent may begin to lower its Saybolt color<br>
[0061]	Once the desired temperature for regeneration is reached, usually a hold period<br>
follows  The penod of time for the regeneration depends on the nature of the catalyst and the extent and nature of the catalyst deactivation, typically from 2 to 20 hours As the catalyst becomes depleted in the deactivating components, the amount and concentration of these materials in the spent benzene regenerating stream will decline The regeneration is typically deemed complete when the content of the deactivating components in the spent benzene regeneration stream drops to a relatively low level<br>
 [0062]	Finally the reactor is a cooled down The inlet regeneration temperature is<br>
reduced from the temperature at the end of the second step to the alkylation temperature The manner and rate of temperature decrease is not critical to the success of this invention The temperature may be ramped down steadily or dropped step-wise with temperature holds<br>
Refining<br>
[0063]	The alkylbenzene effluent from an alkylation reactor generally has the<br>
components and concentrations as set forth in Table 1<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0064]	Typically refining of the alkylbenzene product involves the use of a benzene<br>
distillation, a paraffin distillation and a heavy alkylate distillation, the benzene distillation is generally conducted with a bottoms temperature of less than 300°C, preferably less than 275°C, usually between 230° and 270°C, and at a pressure at which the overhead is provided of between 5 and 300, preferably between 35 and 70, kPa gauge  The overhead generally contains less than 2, preferably less than 1.5, weight percent paraffins   The benzene distillation assembly may comprise one or more distillation columns   More than one overhead may be obtamed from the benzene distillation assembly  For instance, a highly pure stream may be obtained for process needs such as regenerating catalysts or soi bents, e g, having a paraffin concentration less than 1, preferably less than 0 1, weight percent  A lesser punty overhead may be obtained from the benzene distillation assembly, e g , as a side draw, for use as a recycle to the alkylation reaction<br>
[0065]	Each column may contain any convenient packing or distillation trays, but<br>
most often trays such as sieve and bubble trays, are used   Often the assembly provides at least 5, say 6 to 70, and preferably 20 to 50, theoretical plates   The reflux ratio (herein<br>
defined as the distillate to reflux weight ratio) is often in the range of 2 1 to 1 10, preferably<br>
1 5 1 to 1 5   The bottoms stream from the benzene distillation generally contains less than<br>
1000 ppmw, preferably less than 50 ppmw, and sometimes less than 5 ppmw, benzene  The<br>
benzene distillation may occur in a single column or two or more distinct columns may be<br>
used   For instance, a stripping column may be used to remove a portion, e g . 20 to 50<br>
percent, of the benzene and then the bottoms from the stripping column would be subjected to<br>
rectification in a subsequent column to obtain the desired separation<br>
[0066]	The paraffin distillation is generally conducted with a bottoms temperature of<br>
less than 300°C, preferably less than 275°C, usually between 250°C and 275°C, and at a pressure at which overhead is provided of between 5 and 110, preferably between 10 and 50, kPa absolute  The column may contain any convenient packing or distillation trays but most often sieve trays are used  Often the paraffins distillation assembly provides at least 5, say 7 to 20, theoretical plates  The reflux ratio is often in the range of 3 1 to 1 10. preferably 1 1 to 1 3   The bottoms stream from the paraffins distillation generally contains less than 10, preferably less than 5, weight percent paraffins and preferably less than 10. often less than 1, ppmw benzene   Preferably, the bottoms stream contains between 0 5 and 5, say 1 to 5, weight percent paraffins  The paraffins distillation may occur in a single column or two or more distinct columns may be used.<br>
[0067]	The heavy alkylate distillation is generally conducted with a bottoms<br>
temperature of less than 300°C, preferably less than 275°C, usually between 250°C and 275°C, and at a pressure of between 0 5 and 30, preferably between 1 and 5, kPa absolute The column may contain any convenient packing or distillation trays, but most often structured packing is used  Often the heavy alkylate distillation assembly provides at least 5, say 10 to 30, and preferably 10 to 20, theoretical plates  The reflux ratio is often in the range of 2 1 to 1 5, preferably 0 2 1 to 1 1   The overhead from the heavy alkylate distillation generally contains less than 2 weight percent, preferably less than 1 weight percent, and sometimes less than 0.1 weight percent, total heavies   The benzene content of the overhead stream is generally less than 5, preferably less than 1, ppmw and the paraffins content is often less than 10 weight percent<br>
[0068]	In some instances a finishing distillation may be used where a lights-<br>
containmg overhead stream is provided, it is not essential that the paraffin distillation substantially remove all the paraffin from the alkylbenzene stream   Hence opportunities exist<br>
for energy savings   For instance, the amount of reboiler heat can be reduced as the internal reflux in the distillation column need not be as great as when the bottoms stream has a lesser concentration of paraffins   Also, for a given column, the capacity of the column can be increased, e g, to debottleneck an existing refining system<br>
[0069)	With respect to the heavy alkylate distillation column, the finishing column<br>
can remove, as a bottoms stream, heavies   Therefore the heavy alkylate column can be operated to permit significant amounts of heavies to be in the overhead   As with the paraffins distillation, the flexibility provided by tfiese processes enables a reduction in reboiler duty for the heavy alkylate distillation  This reduction, in turn, reduces the reflux in the column thereby allowing more heavies to pass into the overhead stream   In addition to the reduction in reboiler heat duty that could be achieved, the capacity of a given distillation column can be increased<br>
[0070]	The finishing distillation is generally conducted with a bottoms temperature of<br>
less than 300°C, preferably less than 275°C, usually between 250°C and 275°C. and at a<br>
pressure of between 5 and 110, preferably between 10 and 50, kPa absolute   The assembly<br>
may contain any convenient packing or distillation trays, but most often stiuctured packing is<br>
used   Often the assembly provides at least 2, say 5 to 20, theoretical plates  The mid-cut is<br>
generally taken from a point where at least 2, often at least 3, theoretical plates exist above<br>
and at least 2, often at least 3, theoretical plates exist below  Preferably the distillation<br>
assembly is a divided wall column or has an internal column with a dedicated reboiler  The<br>
finishing distillation assembly may also be two separate columns<br>
[0071]	In some instances it may be desired to subject an alkylbenzene stream that<br>
contains olefinic components to a catalytic operation to improve bromine index, the<br>
alkylbenzene stream is passed to a catalytic conversion zone containing an acidic catalyst<br>
under olefin reduction conditions  The particular unit operation is not critical to the broad<br>
aspects of the invention and any suitable operation may be used<br>
[0072]	A number of processes for improving the quality of alkylbenzenes and<br>
reducing olefin content have been proposed  The catalysts may be clay or molecular sieve (natural or synthetic)   Included in the clays are smectites, laponite, saponite, and pillared clays   Filtrol F-24 (Engelhard Corporation, Isehn, New Jersey) is a preferred clay Molecular sieves include zeolites A, beta, L, S, T, X and Y and omega, mordenite, enonite, chabazite, boggsite, clovente, gmehmte, offretite, pentasil molecular sieves having silica to<br>
alumina ratios greater than 10, and SAPO (such as SAPO 5 and 41)  Engelhard Corporation represents that Filtrol F-24 has a pH of 3 5<br>
[0073]	The bromine index reduction is typically conducted at temperatures between<br>
25°C and 250°C, and most often between 70°C and 150°C. under a pressure sufficient to maintain the stream under liquid conditions, e g , within the range of 0 1 to 150 kPa absolute The contact time with the catalyst is sufficient to provide the desired reduction in bromine index   For a fixed bed system, the weight hourly space velocity is typically in the range of 0 1 to 20 hr-1   The bromine index of the treated alkylbenzene stream is preferably below 10 The bromine index reduction conditions also cause byproducts such as the formation of dialkylbenzene and benzene from alkylbenzene and form oligomers and polymers from olefinic components.<br>
[0074]	The effluent from the bromine index reduction is subjected to the fourth<br>
distillation to remove as an overhead, benzene, and heavies such as the dialkylbenzene and the oligomers and polymers from olefinic components Transalkylation<br>
[0075J	The bottoms from the heavy alkylate column can be recovered and used as a<br>
heavy alkylate product, or can be subjected to a further separation, e g , by distillation to<br>
recover alkylbenzene contained therein, or can be subjected to a transalkylation in the<br>
presence of benzene to convert, e g , dialkylbenzenes to monoalkylbenzene<br>
J0076J	The transalkylation can be continuous or batch (semicontmuous)  The<br>
transalkylation conditions including catalyst can vary widely  Typical catalysts include those having acidic functionality   Acidic catalysts compnse zeolites having a zeolite structure type selected from the group consisting of FAU, BE A, MOR, MTW, and NES Such zeolites include mordenite, ZSM-4, ZSM-12, ZSM-20, ZSM-38, MCM-22. MCM-36, MCM-49 UZM-8, offretite, gmelinite, zeolite Y. NU-87, and gottardite  Another class of acidic, solid catalyst components are acidified refractory oxides such as chlonded, fluonded, or sulfated alumina, gallia, bona, molybdia, ytterbia, titania, chromia, silica, zircoma, and the like and combinations thereof Clays such as beidellite clays, hectonte clays, laponite clays, montmonllomte clays, nontomte clays, saponite clays, bentonite clays and mixtures thereof and amorphous catalysts may also find utility<br>
[0077J	If desired, the transalkylation catalyst may be metal stabilized  The metal<br>
component typically is a noble metal or base metal   The noble metal is a platinum-group<br>
metal is selected from platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, and iridium. The<br>
base metal is selected from the group consisting of rhenium, tin. germanium, lead, cobalt,<br>
nickel, indium, gallium, zinc, uranium, dysprosium, thallium, and mixtures thereof The base<br>
metal may be combined with another base metal, or with a noble metal   Preferably the metal<br>
component comprises rhenium   Suitable metal amounts m the transalkylation catalyst range<br>
from 0 01 to 10 mass-percent, with the range from 0 1 to 3 mass-percent being preferred and<br>
the range from 0 1 to 1 mass-percent being highly preferred   In some instances, it may be<br>
desirable to modify the catalyst such as by sulfidmg either m-situ or ex-situ<br>
[0078J	The catalyst may contain suitable binder or matrix material such as inorganic<br>
oxides and other suitable materials  The relative proportion of molecular sieve or other catalytically active component in the catalyst may range from 10 to 99 mass-percent, with 20 to 90 mass-percent being preferred. A refractory binder or matrix can be used to facilitate fabncation of the catalyst, provide strength and reduce fabrication costs The binder should be uniform in composition and relatively refractory to the conditions used in the process Suitable binders include inorgamc oxides such as one or moie of alumina, magnesia, zirconia, chromia, titania, boria and silica. The catalyst also may contain, without so limiting the composite, one or more of (1) other inorganic oxides including, but not limited to, berylha, germama, vanadia, tin oxide, zinc oxide, iron oxide and cobalt oxide, (2) non-zeolitic molecular sieves, such as the aluminophosphates of US 4,310,440, the sihcoaluminophosphates of US 4,440,871 and ELAPSOs of US 4,793,984, and (3) spinels such as MgAl204, FeAhC^, Z11AI2O4, CaA^CU, and otiier like compounds having the formula MO—AI2O3 where M is a metal having a valence of 2, which components can be added to the composite at any suitable point<br>
[0079]	The transalkylation is conducted in the liquid phase with a benzene to total<br>
alkyl substituted benzenes ratio (Bz TAB) of at least 11   Often this ratio is between 2 1 to 100 1   In general, higher Bz TAB is preferred as the liquid flow assists in removing coke precursors from the catalyst, thereby enhancing time on stream prior to regeneration or replacement   Preferred Bz TAB will depend upon the seventy of the transalkylation conditions, the superficial liquid velocity in the catalyst bed and the conversion per pass Typically, the Bz TAB is within the range of 20 1 to 80 1, say, 30 1 to 60 1   The spent benzene-containing regeneration stream may be used directly or may be subjected to a purification to remove undesirable components such as gums and coke precursors   The<br>
purification may be a selective sorption, membrane separation or, preferably, a distillation<br>
Advantageously, adequate purification via a distillation may be obtained by a flash<br>
distillation or one containing up to 2 theoretical distillation plates and low reflux to feed<br>
ratios  The spent benzene-containmg stream provides at least 50 mass percent<br>
[0080]	As stated above, the processes of this invention may use all or a portion of the<br>
spent benzene-containing regeneration stream as feed for transalkylation   Where a portion of the spent benzene-containing stream is used, it may be an aliquot portion or may be taken from select stages of the regeneration process  The regeneration of the alkylation catalyst proceeds in generally four stages, purge, heating stage, hold period and cool down period The composition of the spent benzene-containmg stream will vary by each stage   As the spent benzene stream from the purge stage contains paraffins, alkylbenzene, and heavies from the interstices of the catalyst bed, it can readily be used as a benzene source for the transalkylation  When the regeneration of the alkylation catalyst proceeds to stages where deactivating components are being removed, often the spent benzene can be used without intervening treatment such as a flash distillation, without undue adverse effects on the transalkylation catalyst stability or alkylbenzene product quality<br>
[0081]	Conditions employed for transalkylation normally include a temperature of<br>
from 130°C to 270°C, preferably from 180°C to 240°C   At higher temperatures, a greater<br>
amount of cracking occurs with increased co-production of lights, l e , aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
having 9 and fewer carbon atoms   Also, the higher temperatures tend to result in loss of<br>
linearity of the alkylbenzene which is not desirable for alkylbenzenes to be used for<br>
sulfonation to detergents   Hence, the more preferred transalkylation temperatures are from<br>
190°C to 220°C   Moderately elevated pressures broadly ranging from 100 kPa to 10 MPa<br>
absolute are also used for transalkylation such that the reactants remain in the liquid state<br>
[0082]	The transalkylation reaction can be effected over a wide range of space<br>
velocities, with higher space velocities enhancing the stability of the catalyst but at the expense of conversion of dialkylbenzenes to monoalkylbenzene   Often, the conversion of dialkylbenzenes in the feed to a transalkylation zone is less than 60 mass percent, say, between 20 and 50 mass percent   Weight hourly space velocity generally is in the range of from 0 1 to 30, and frequently between 0 5 and 4, hr"1   In general, lower space velocities are preferred with lower Bz TAB's from the standpoint of catalyst stability   The adding of hydrogen is optional   If present, free hydrogen is associated with the feedstock and recycled<br>
hydrocarbons in an amount of 0 1 moles per mole of TAB up to 10 moles per mole of TAB<br>
As the temperature for transalkylation is typically more severe than that used for the<br>
alkylation of benzene, isomenzation of the alkyl groups is more prevalent   Since the ratio of<br>
dialkylbenzene to total alkylbenzenes from the alkylation reaction is typically low, the<br>
linearity of the combined alkylbenzenes, that from the alkylation and that from the<br>
transalkylation, is often at least 85, preferably at least 88, mass percent<br>
[0083]	For purposes herein, a catalyst bed is termed a reactor whether in the same or a<br>
separate vessel from another bed   The catalyst may be used as a packed bed or a fluidized bed  The feed to the reaction zone may be passed either upflow or downflow, or even horizontally as in a radial bed reactor  In one desirable variant, olefin-contaming feedstock may be fed into several discrete points within the reaction zone<br>
[0084]	One or more transalkylation zones can be used. The transalkylation zones<br>
may be configured in parallel with the same or different catalyst in each   A preferred transalkylation process effectively uses the benzene by separating at least a portion of the benzene from at least one transalkylation zone and passing that benzene to one or more transalkylation zones as all or a part of the benzene The separation, if by distillation, will result in some of the lights also being recycled and a continuous or intermittent purge may be required to maintain the lights at a suitable concentration, e g , less than 20, preferably less than 10, volume percent of the separated benzene   Preferably the fraction containing the alkylbenzene will also contain benzene to assist in maintaining a steady state operation  One advantage with this preferred process using a separation unit operation associated with the transalkylation zone is that the amount of fresh benzene required is reduced while still being able to provide a high Bz TAB<br>
[0085]	With respect to the associated separation being a distillation (transalkylation<br>
distillation), the amount of effluent from one or more transalkylation zones that is directed to the transalkylation distillation may be as little as 20 weight percent of the total effluent or may comprise the entire effluent stream  Often at least 50, and sometimes at least 80, weight percent of the effluent is subjected to the transalkylation distillation   Where more than one transalkylation zone is used, the effluent from one or more of the zones can be fed to the transalkylation distillation<br>
[0086]	In any event, sufficient fluid must be removed from the transalkylation zone<br>
and the transalkylation distillation loop to prevent an undue build-up of merts or other<br>
impurities m the loop  Typically the concentration of lights in the alkylation zone is less than 20 weight percent, and preferably less than 10, weight percent   Only a portion of the benzene contained in the feed to the transalkylation distillation zone is intended to be recovered in the overhead   The amount of the aromatic compound recovered in the overhead is often between 20 and 98, say, 50 to 70 or 90, weight percent of that in the distillation feed   The overhead may also contain lights<br>
[0087]	Advantageously, the distillation equipment need not be extensive to achieve<br>
such recovery, e g , the distillation may be accomplished with less than 5 theoretical plates Moreover, the lights distillation is preferably conducted without significant reboiler heat Preferably the sought recovery of benzene is accomplished by a flash distillation due to temperature of the effluent from the transalkylation zone without the need for a heat source Where heat is supplied to the transalkylation distillation, e g, to provide for internal reflux in a fractionation column, it preferably is less than 40, more preferably less than 30, kilocalones per kilogram of the feed to the transalkylation distillation   Where a reflux is used, the rate of external reflux (distillation feed to reflux, F/R) is preferably between 0 1 1 to 2 1, more preferably between 0 4 1 and 0 8 1, kilogram per kilogram of effluent fed to the transalkylation distillation zone<br>
[0088]	The transalkylation distillation may be effected in an open vessel for a flash<br>
distillation or may contain suitable trays or packing for a fractionation   A flash distillation<br>
may contain a demister to prevent liquid carryover in the overhead   Heat to the lights<br>
distillation zone may be provided by indirect heat exchange at the bottom of the zone, or by<br>
withdrawing, heating and recycling to the base of the column a portion of the liquid contained<br>
at the bottom of the lights distillation zone   The transalkylation distillation will provide a<br>
higher boiling fraction containing alkylbenzene, heavies and benzene<br>
[0089]	All or a portion of the transalkylation product (obtained either or both from the<br>
transalkylation zone or the separation) is passed to the benzene column of the refining section   Unreacted heavies, of course, will be recovered in the refining section and can be thus recycled to the transalkylation unit operation   Where the transalkylation is operated to achieve a low conversion per pass, say, 20 to 40 weight percent conversion of the dialkylbenzenes, a portion of the transalkylation product (obtained either or both from the transalkylation zone or the separation) can be passed to a transalkylation zone for further<br>
conversion   Since low conversion is acceptable, lower temperatures can be used to enhance the linearity of the alkylbenzene produced by the transalkylation<br>
[0090]	In some instances it may be desired to regenerate the transalkylation catalyst<br>
Any suitable regeneration conditions may be used   Conveniently, the regeneration is effected by passing through the catalyst bed benzene at elevated temperature   The benzene may be from any suitable source, especially a portion of the spent benzene-containing stream from the regeneration of the alkylation catalyst  The temperature for the regeneration should not be so high as to adversely affect the transalkylation catalyst  Usually the temperature is in the range of 170°C to 300°C, say, 190°C to 220°C or 250°C   The duration of the regeneration may vary depending upon the extent of regeneration sought and the other conditions for the regeneration  Typically, the regeneration proceeds for at least 1 hour, e g, from 4 to 50 hours  The spent regenerant can be disposed of in any suitable manner  The spent benzene-containing regenerant may be subjected to a flash distillation to remove high boiling impurities such as carbonaceous deposits and precursors, and then passed to the benzene distillation in the alkylbenzene refining system<br>
THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0091]	The drawings are provided in illustration of an embodiment of the invention<br>
and are not in limitation thereof<br>
[0092]	Figure 1 schematically depicts an alkylbenzene complex 100 including the<br>
dehydrogenation of paraffin feedstock to make the olefin-containmg feedstock for the alkylation  As shown, paraffin feedstock is supplied via line 102 to olefin production unit 104   Olefin production unit dehydrogenates paraffin and yields an olefin-contaimng feedstock which is withdrawn via line 106   Within olefin production unit 104 is not only a dehydrogenation reactor but also a distillation refining system and a selective hydrogenation unit operation to eliminate diolefins   The olefin-contaimng feedstock in line 106 contains predominantly paraffins, 10 to 15 volume percent olefins and other co-boiling hydrocarbons including aromatics   Thus the feedstock is passed to selective sorption unit 108 for removal of aromatic impurities   The selective sorption unit 108 may be of any suitable design such as disclosed above  The selective sorption unit uses solid sorbent which can be regenerated with a benzene stream as will be discussed later<br>
 [0093]	The treated olefin-containing feedstock is then passed via line 110 to<br>
alkylation reaction assembly 112   Alkylation reaction assembly is discussed in connection with Figure 2   In Figure 2, the olefin-containing feedstock in line 110 is passed to olefin header 114 and then to control valve assemblies 116a, 116b and 116c associated with reactors 118a, 118b and 118c   Control valve assemblies may be one or more valves to control flows into and out of each reactor<br>
[0094J	Benzene is supplied via line 120 to benzene header 122 which is in flow<br>
communication with each of control valve assemblies 116a, 116b and 116c   Each of control valve assemblies 116a, 116b and 116c are in fluid communication with reactors 118a, 118b and 118c, respectively via lines 124a, 124b and 124c   Reactors 118a, 118b and 118c are in fluid communication with the next sequential control valve assembly 116b. 116c and 116d, respectively via lines 126a, 126b and 126c   Each of control valve assemblies 116a, 116b, 116c and 116d are in fluid communication with internal flow header 128   Internal flow header 128 allows for the passage of a reactor effluent from one reactor to the inlet for another reactor   Each of control valve assemblies 116b, 116c and 116d are in fluid communication with alkylation effluent header 130 which in turn is in communication with line 132 for withdrawing alkylation effluent from alkylation reaction assembly 112   Each of control valve assemblies 116b, 116c and 116d are also in fluid communication with spent benzene header 134 which in turn is m communication with line 136 for withdrawing spent benzene from alkylation reaction assembly 112.<br>
[0095]	In operation, alkylation reactor assembly permits two reactors to be<br>
sequentially on stream while one reactor is undergoing regeneration and permits any of the reactors to be the first reactor in the series on stream   By way of illustration, olefin-containing feedstock m header 114 is partitioned by valve assemblies 116a, 116 b and 116c to provide a portion of the feedstock only to reactors 118a and 118b   With reactor 118a being the first in the series, the control valve assemblies provide for benzene for the alkylation reactor to be all introduced into reactor 118a  Thus control valve assembly 118b permits no benzene from benzene header 122 from entering into reactor 118b   However, control valve assembly 116c permits benzene at a rate suitable for regeneration to be introduced into reactor 118c   The effluent from reactor 118a passes via line 126a to control valve assembly 116b As reactor 118b is the next reactor in series, the effluent is directed via line 124b to reactor 118b  Control valve assembly directs the effluent from reactor 118b which is<br>
conveyed by line 126b to alkylation effluent header 130 to be withdrawn from reactor assembly 112 via line 132   Reactor 118c is undergoing regeneration and the spent benzene regenerant is passed via line 126c from reactor 118c to control valve assembly 116d which directs it to benzene purge header 134 and withdrawal from alkylation reactor 112 via line 136<br>
[0096]	Upon completion of the regeneration of the catalyst in reactor 118c, it is<br>
placed back on-line and one of the other reactors is taken out of service for catalyst regeneration   Typically, the second reactor in the series on line is transitioned to regeneration   In such event, reactor 118c becomes the first reactor in the series and reactor 118a becomes the second in series  The control valve assembly appropriately changes the flows of the various streams  Thus, the benzene for the alkylation reaction is passed through valve assembly 116c and line 124c to reactor 118c while no benzene passes through valve assembly U6a  Benzene for regeneration is passed through valve assembly 116b and line 124b to reactor 118b   Olefin-contaimng feedstock is partitioned between valve assemblies 116a and 116c   The effluent from reactor 118c is passed via line 126c to valve assembly 116d to internal flow header which directs the effluent to valve assembly 116a to be passed to reactor 118a  Valve assembly 116b directs the effluent from reactor 118a to alkylation effluent header 130 The effluent from reactor 118b, which is being regenerated, is directed by valve assembly 116c to benzene purge header 134<br>
[0097]	As can be seen from the above, each of the reactors can be cycled to different<br>
positions while on stream and taken off-stream for regeneration<br>
[0098]	Returning to Figure 1, alkylation effluent from reactor assembly 112 is passed<br>
via line 132 to benzene column 138 to provide a benzene-containing fraction which is recycled via line 120 to reactor assembly 112   Fresh benzene is provided via line 140 to benzene column 138   Not shown, but optional uses for the benzene-containing fraction from benzene column 138 is as a feed to the transalkylation reaction system and as a regenerant for the solid sorbent in selective sorption unit 108<br>
[0099]	The bottoms fraction from benzene column, which contains alkylbenzene,<br>
heavies and paraffin is passed via line 142 to paraffins column 144   A lower boiling fraction rich in paraffins is passed via line 146 to olefin production unit 104   The bottoms fraction of paraffins column 144, which contains alkylbenzene and heavies is passed via line 148 to heavy alkylate column 150  Heavy alkylate column 150 provides a lower boiling fraction<br>
rich in alkylbenzene that is withdrawn via line 152   This fraction may also contain some benzene and paraffins as well as some olefinic components and thus a clay treater and finishing column are used  As shown, the lower boiling fraction in line 152 is passed to clay treater 154 and then via line 156 to finishing column 158   A side draw from finishing column 158 is taken via line 160 which is the alkylbenzene product  An overhead fraction containing paraffin and benzene is passed via line 162 to line 146 for ultimate recycling to olefins production unit 104   The bottoms fraction from finishing column 158 contains dialkylbenzene and is passed via line 164 for combination with the bottoms fraction from heavy alkylate column 150 which is withdrawn via line 166   The bottoms fraction from the heavy alkylate column contains heavies, l e , dialkylbenzene, other heavier aromatics and olefin oligomers, and some alkylbenzene  The combmed stream passes to transalkylation assembly 168   A stream may be split off via line 198 eidier as a purge to prevent undue build-up of heavy hydrocarbons or for further refining to provide a dialkyl benzene-containing product<br>
100100]	Returning to alkylation reactor assembly 112, spent benzene regenerant, which<br>
contains benzene as well as deactivating components removed from the catalyst, is passed via line 136 to distributor assembly 170   While not essential, distributor assembly directs the spent benzene regenerant that contains little color formers and gums directly to transalkylation assembly 168 via line 172  This spent benzene is from a purge of the reactor undergoing regeneration and thus contains alkylbenzenes, paraffin, and dialkylbenzene from the interstitial regions and from the catalyst surface and possibly some of the regenerant as the reactor cools down to temperatures suitable for alkylation  As the color formers and gums start to be removed from the regenerating catalyst, distributor 170 dnects the spent benzene regenerant to hold tank 174 via line 176   Hold tank 174 serves as a reservoir for the spent benzene regenerant from which a constant flow of benzene can be withdrawn via line 178 for distillation in column 180<br>
[00101]	A bottoms fraction containing higher molecular weight color formers and<br>
deactivating components is withdrawn via line 182 from column 180   A benzene fraction is withdrawn via line 184   As shown, a portion of the benzene fraction in line 184 is directed to selective sorption unit 108 as regenerant   The spent regenerant from selective sorption unit 108 is passed via line 186 to hold tank 174<br>
 [00102]	A portion of the benzene fraction in line 184 is passed via line 188 to valve<br>
assembly 190 which can direct all or part of the stream via line 192 to line 172 for the transalkylation assembly 168 and all or part of the stream via line 194 to line 196 which is in communication with benzene column.<br>
[00103]	Transalkylation assembly 168 is described further with reference to Figure 3<br>
The combined bottoms fraction from heavy alkylate column 150 and from finishing column<br>
158 is passed to transalkylation assembly 168 via line 166, and a portion of the stream is<br>
directed to each of reactors 200 and 202 via lines 204 and 206, respectively   The make-up<br>
benzene is supplied by line 172 to line 204 and is passed to transalkylation reactor 200  The<br>
transalkylation effluent is withdrawn from reactor 200 via line 208 and supplied to stripping<br>
column 210 which serves to provide a benzene-containing fraction in line 212   A purge of<br>
the benzene-containing fraction can be effected via line 214  This purge can be passed to the<br>
benzene column, used for fuel value or exhausted from the complex   As shown, a portion of<br>
the benzene-containing fraction can be recycled, if desired, to reactor 200   The balance of<br>
this fraction is passed via line 218 to serve as the benzene for the transalkylation in reactor<br>
202  Alternatively, part of the make-up benzene in line 172 can be passed to reactor 202<br>
The effluent from reactor 202 is passed via line 220 to stripping column 210<br>
[00104]	The bottoms fraction from stripping column 210 contains alkylbenzene<br>
produced by the transalkylation, unreacted dialkylbenzene, other heavies and a portion of the benzene  The bottoms fraction is withdrawn via line 196 and passed to benzene column 138 where benzene is recovered   The remaining unit operations in the refining section recover alkylbenzene, paraffin and return dialkylbenzene to the transalkylation assembly   If desired, a stream can be removed from line 196 and recycled to reactors 200 and 202 via lines 222 and 224, respectively for further conversion of unreacted dialkylbenzene<br>
