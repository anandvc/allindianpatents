The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to substituted benzoylpyrazoles.<br>

further reaction auxiliaries. Suitable (further) reaction auxiliaries for the processes<br>

Suitable diluents for carrying out the processes (a), (b) and (c) according to the<br>
15	invention are especially inert organic solvents. These include, in particular, aliphatic,<br>
alicyclic or aromatic, optionally halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example,<br>
benzine, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, petroleum ether,<br>
hexane, cyclohexane,  dichloromethane,  chloroform,  carbon  tetrachloride  or  1,4-<br>
dichloro-ethane;    ethers,    such    as    diethyl    ether,    diisopropyl    ether,    dioxane,<br>

The processes (a), (b) and (c) according to the invention are generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, it is also possible to carry out the processes according to the invention under elevated or reduced pressure - in general between 0.1 bar and 10 bar. 5<br>
For carrying out the processes (a), (b) and (c) according to the invention, the starting<br>
materials are generally employed in approximately equimolar amounts. However, it<br>
is also possible to use a relatively large excess of one of the components. The<br>
reaction is generally carried out in a suitable diluent in the presence of a dehydrating<br>
10	agent, and the reaction mixture is generally stirred for a number of hours at the<br>
required temperature. Work-up is carried out by customary methods (cf. the Preparation Examples).<br>
The  active compounds  according to the invention  can  be used  as defoliants,<br>
15	desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weed killers. By weeds in the broadest<br>
sense there are to be understood all plants which grow in locations where they are undesired. Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
20	According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By<br>
plants are understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or<br>
25	combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant<br>
varieties which may or may not be protected by plant variety protection rights. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds<br>
30	and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include crops, and vegetative<br>
and  generative  propagation  material,  for example  seedlings,  tubers,  rhizomes, • cuttings and seeds.<br><br>

The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
5	spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of<br>
propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by single- or multi-layer coating.<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds according to the invention are<br>
5	suitable for total weed control, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks and on<br>
paths and areas with or without tree growth. Equally, the active compounds<br>
according to the invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops,<br>
for example forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut<br>
orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations,<br>
10	oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns<br>
and turf and pastures and for selective weed control in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
activity and a broad activity spectrum when applied to the soil and on above-ground<br>
15	parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for selective control of<br>
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
20	solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
25	These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
30	If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents<br>
as auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics, such as xylene,  toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics  and chlorinated<br>

form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>

The precipitated dicyclohexylurea is removed by filtration with suction, and the mother liquor is extracted twice with diethyl ether. With stirring, the aqueous phase is adjusted by addition of cone, hydrochloric acid to a pH of about 1. The oily product that separates off during the addition is extracted with methylene chloride, and the extraction solution is dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is carefully distilled off under waterpump vacuum.<br>
This gives 1.5 g (72% of theory) of 4-methyl-5-trifluoromethyl-2-[3-chloro-4-(l-ethyl-5-hydroxy-pyrazol-4-yl-carbony])-phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one as an amorphous product.<br>

10	10 g (49 mmol) of 2-methyl-4-tnfluoromethyl-benzoic acid are dissolved in 150 ml<br>
of ethanol and admixed with 1 ml of cone, sulfuric acid. The solution is heated at reflux for 24 hours and then concentrated, the residue is taken up in methylene chloride and the mixture is extracted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The methylene chloride phase is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under<br>
