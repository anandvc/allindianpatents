				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of monovinylarene-conjugated<br>
diene block copolymers. More particularly, it concerns blends of such copolymers with<br>
other monovinylarene-containing polymers.<br>
Thermally-formed packaging articles include categories that may be referred to<br>
herein as thermoformed packaging articles and shrink labels. Thermoformed packaging<br>
articles, for example, so-called clamshell packages and blister packs, are well known for<br>
packaging relatively small, relatively light articles, especially those for which it is desired<br>
to allow a consumer to visually inspect the article prior to purchase. Examples of<br>
packaged products include, but are not limited to, portable electronic devices (such as<br>
personal music players, telephone accessories, handheld electronic games, computer<br>
accessories, and game console accessories, among others), prepackaged foods (such as<br>
pudding cups, among others), and medical supplies, among others. To allow visual<br>
inspection and consumer handling of thermoformed packaging articles, such articles are<br>
generally made from materials having both high clarity and high toughness.<br>
Shrink labels are known for use in labeling preformed packages or sealing the<br>
closures of preformed packages. Examples of such uses of shrink labels include, but are<br>
not limited to, labels on contoured bottles of beverages and containers of prepackaged<br>
foods and tamper-evident seals over the caps of pharmaceutical bottles, among others.<br>
Two materials frequently used in thermally-formed packages are<br>
polyvinylchloride (PVC) and glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG).<br>
PETG is generally considered to have a relatively low glass transition temperature and a<br>
relatively high shrinkage upon exposure to heat, and as a result has been frequently used<br>
in shrink film applications. However, PETG is relatively expensive and has low melt<br>
strength, low heat deflection temperature, a tendency to absorb moisture, and relatively<br>
high specific gravity. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is relatively inexpensive, and has been<br>
used in thermally-formed packaging applications, but its poorer shrink performance (in<br>
shrink film applications), relatively high specific gravity, formation of corrosive and<br>
hazardous gases during extrusion, and a negative public perception of both several<br>
plasticizers often used to soften PVC and several of its incineration products render it less<br>
desirable.<br>
Styrenic polymers, including styrene-butadiene copolymers, do not have these<br>
disadvantages. However, it remains challenging to produce thermally-formed packaging<br>
articles containing styrene-butadiene copolymers which have clarity, toughness, and<br>
shrink properties competitive with PVC or PETG.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a composition, comprising (i)<br>
from about 25 parts by weight to about 95 parts by weight of a mono vinyl areneconjugated<br>
diene coupled block copolymer comprising at least one tapered block, having<br>
a blocky monovinylarene content of less than 90 wt% of total mono vinyl arene units, and<br>
comprising a terminal monovinylarene block having a molecular weight of less than<br>
60,000 g/mol; and (ii) from about 5 parts by weight to about 75 parts by weight of a<br>
monovinylarene-alky] (meth)acrylate copolymer, comprising (ii-a) monovinylarene units<br>
and (ii-b) either alkyl acrylate units, alkyl methacrylate units, or both.<br>
In other embodiments, the present invention relates to shrink films and rigid<br>
packaging, each comprising a layer comprising the composition described above.<br>
In other embodiments, the present invention relates to methods of packaging<br>
products by use of the shrink films or rigid packaging described above.<br>
We report styrene-butadiene copolymers which have clarity, toughness, and<br>
shrink properties competitive with PVC or PETG and their use in thermally-formed<br>
packaging article applications for which PVC or PETG have been used.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a composition, comprising:<br>
(i) from about 25 parts by weight to about 95 parts by weight of a<br>
monovinylarene-conjugated diene coupled block copolymer comprising at least one<br>
tapered block, having a blocky monovinylarene content of less than 90 wt% of total<br>
monovinylarene units, and comprising a terminal monovinylarene block having a<br>
molecular weight of less than 60,000 g/mol; and<br>
(ii) from about 5 parts by weight to about 75 parts by weight of a<br>
monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer, comprising (ii-a) monovinylarene units<br>
and (ii-b) either alkyl acrylate units, alkyl methacrylate units, or both.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary or apparent from the plain meaning of a phrase,<br>
the word "or" has the inclusive meaning. The adjectives "first," "second," and so forth<br>
are not to be construed as limiting the modified subjects to a particular order in time,<br>
space, or both, unless specified to the contrary. A "copolymer" is used herein to refer to<br>
any polymer comprising at least two types of units, e.g., two types of units, three types of<br>
units, etc.<br>
The composition comprises a blend of the two polymers, as will be discussed in<br>
more detail below. Any physical form of the blend is a composition, as the term is used<br>
herein. By way of example only, the composition can be in the form of a melt, pellets, a<br>
solution of the polymers in a solvent, one or more layers in a single-layer or multi-layer<br>
film, or one or more layers in a single-layer or multi-layer formed structure (such as a<br>
clamshell package, a blister pack, a thermoformed tray, or a shrink label, among others),<br>
among others.<br>
The basic starting materials and polymerization conditions for preparing<br>
monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymers are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
4,091,053; 4,584,346; 4,704,434; 4,704,435; 5,130,377; 5,227,419; 6,265,484; 6,265,485;<br>
6,420,486; and 6,444,755, which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
techniques taught therein are generally applicable to the preparation of the<br>
monovinylarene-conjugated diene rubbers discussed below.<br>
"Monovinylarene," as used herein, refers to an organic compound containing a<br>
single carbon-carbon double bond, at least one aromatic moiety, and a total of 8 to 18<br>
carbon atoms, such as 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Exemplary monovinylarenes include, but<br>
are not limited to, styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, 2-methylstyrene, 3-methylstyrene, 4-<br>
methylstyrene, 2-ethylstyrene, 3-ethylstyrene, 4-ethylstyrene, 4-n-propylstyrene, 4-tbutylstyrene,<br>
2,4-dimethylstyrene, 4-cyclohexylstyrene, 4-decylstyrene, 2-ethyl-4-<br>
benzylstyrene, 4-(4-phenyl-n-butyl)styrene, 1-vinylnaphthalene, 2-vinylnaphthalene, and<br>
mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the monovinylarene is styrene. A unit of polymer,<br>
wherein the unit is derived from polymerization of a monovinylarene monomer, is a<br>
"monovinylarene unit."<br>
"Conjugated diene," as used herein, refers to an organic compound containing<br>
conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds and a total of 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as 4 to<br>
8 carbon atoms. Exemplary conjugated dienes include, but are not limited to, 1,3-<br>
butadiene, 2-methy]-l,3-butadiene, 2-ethyl-l,3-butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene,<br>
1,3-pentadiene, 3-butyl-l,3-octadiene, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the<br>
conjugated diene can be 1,3-butadiene or isoprene. A unit of polymer, wherein the unit is<br>
derived from polymerization of a conjugate diene monomer, is a "conjugated diene unit."<br>
A "monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer" is a polymer comprising<br>
monovinylarene units and conjugated diene units. The polymer comprises one or more<br>
blocks, wherein each block comprises monovinylarene units or conjugated diene units.<br>
Any particular block can comprise either or both monovinylarene units or conjugated<br>
diene units. If it comprises only one type of units, it can be termed a "monoblock." If it<br>
comprises both, it can be a random block, a tapered block, a stepwise block, or any other<br>
type of block. In the present invention, "monovinyl arene-conjugated diene block<br>
copolymer" does not include monovinylarene-conjugated diene rubbers, as defined<br>
below.<br>
A block is "random" when the mole fractions of conjugated diene units and<br>
monovinylarene units in a section of the block are substantially the same as the mole<br>
fractions of conjugated diene units and monovinylarene units in the entire block. This<br>
does not preclude the possibility of sections of the block having regularity (i.e., appearing<br>
non-random), but such regular sections will typically be present at no more than about the<br>
level expected by chance.<br>
A block is "tapered" when both (a) the mole fraction of conjugated diene units in<br>
a first section of the block is higher than the mole fraction of conjugated diene units in a<br>
second section of the block, wherein the second section of the block is closer to a given<br>
end of the block and (b) condition (a) is true for substantially all sections of the block.<br>
(Depending on the size of the sections being considered, condition (a) may not be true for<br>
all sections, but if so, will be not true at no more than about the level expected by<br>
chance).<br>
A block is "stepwise" when a first section of the block contains substantially all<br>
monovinylarene units of the block and a second section of the block contains<br>
substantially all conjugated diene units of the block. In light of the above definition, the<br>
first section is not necessarily prior to the second section in time, space, or any other<br>
parameter.<br>
In one embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene copolymer is a block<br>
copolymer comprising styrene blocks and butadiene blocks (a "styrene-butadiene<br>
copolymer")- An exemplary styrene-butadiene copolymer is commercially available<br>
under the name K-Resin® SBC (Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., The Woodlands, TX).<br>
Generally, each block is formed by polymerizing the monomer or mixture of<br>
monomers from which the desired units of the block are derived. The polymerization<br>
process will generally be amenable to a relative lack of change in process parameters<br>
between different blocks, but the skilled artisan, having the benefit of the present<br>
disclosure, may make some minor changes in process parameters between different<br>
blocks as a matter of routine experimentation. The following descriptions of the<br>
polymerization process will generally apply to the formation of all types of blocks in the<br>
inventive polymer, although certain descriptions may be of more or less value to forming<br>
one or more of the types of blocks in the inventive polymer.<br>
The polymerization process can be carried out in a hydrocarbon diluent at any<br>
suitable temperature in the range of from about -100°C to about 150°C, such as from<br>
about 0°C to about 150°C, and at a pressure sufficient to maintain the reaction mixture<br>
substantially in the liquid phase. In one embodiment, the hydrocarbon diluent can be a<br>
linear or cyclic paraffin, or mixtures thereof. Exemplary linear or cyclic paraffins<br>
include, but are not limited to, pentane, hexane, octane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and<br>
mixtures thereof, among others. In one embodiment, the paraffin is cyclohexane.<br>
The polymerization process can be carried out in the substantial absence of<br>
oxygen and water, such as under an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
The polymerization process can be performed in the presence of an initiator. In<br>
one embodiment, the initiator can be any organomonoalkali metal compound known for<br>
use as an initiator. In a further embodiment, the initiator can have the formula RM,<br>
wherein R is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aryl radical containing 4 to 8 carbon atoms, such as<br>
an n-butyl radical, and M is an alkali metal, such as lithium. In a particular embodiment,<br>
the initiator is n-butyl lithium.<br>
The amount of initiator employed depends upon the desired polymer or block<br>
molecular weight, as is known in the art and is readily determinable, making due<br>
allowance for traces of reaction poisons in the feed streams.<br>
The polymerization process can further involve the inclusion of small amounts of<br>
randomizers. In one embodiment, the randomizer can be a polar organic compound, such<br>
as an ether, a thioether, or a tertiary amine. In another embodiment, the randomizer can<br>
be a potassium salt or a sodium salt of an alcohol. The randomizer can be included in the<br>
hydrocarbon diluent to improve the effectiveness of the initiator, to randomize at least<br>
part of the monovinylarene monomer in a mixed monomer charge, or both. The inclusion<br>
of a randomizer can be of value when forming a random or tapered monovinylareneconjugated<br>
diene block of the present polymer.<br>
Exemplary randomizers include, but are not limited to, dimethyl ether, diethyl<br>
ether, ethyl methyl ether, ethyl propyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-octyl ether, anisole,<br>
dioxane, 1,2-dimetboxyethane, dibenzyl ether, diphenyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, potassium tert-amylate, dimethyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, di-n-propyl<br>
sulfide, di-n-butyl sulfide, methyl ethyl sulfide, dimethylethylamine, tri-n-ethylamine, trin-<br>
propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, trimethylanine, triethylamine,<br>
tetramethylethylenediamine, tetraethylethylenediamine, N,N-di-methylaniline, N-methyl-<br>
N-ethylaniline, N-methylmorpholine, and mixtures thereof, among others.<br>
When forming a particular block, each monomer charge or monomer mixture<br>
charge can be polymerized under solution polymerization conditions such that the<br>
polymerization of each monomer charge or monomer mixture charge, to form the<br>
particular block, is substantially complete before charging a subsequent charge.<br>
"Charging," as used herein, refers to the introduction of a compound to a reaction zone,<br>
such as the interior of a reactor vessel.<br>
Though not to be bound by theory, if an initiator is included in a charge, a block<br>
will typically form either de novo or by addition to the end of an unterminated,<br>
previously-formed, block. Further not to be bound by theory, if an initiator is not<br>
included in a charge, a block will typically only form by addition to the end of an<br>
unterminated, previously-formed, block.<br>
A coupling agent can be added after polymerization is complete. Suitable<br>
coupling agents include, but are not limited to, di- or multivinylarene compounds; di- or<br>
multiepoxides; di- or multiisocyanates; di- or multialkoxysilanes; di- or multiimines; dior<br>
multialdehydes; di- or multiketones; alkoxytin compounds; di- or multihalides, such as<br>
silicon halides and halosilanes; mono-, di-, or multianhydrides; di- or multiesters, such as<br>
the esters of monoalcohols with polycarboxylic acids; diesters which are esters of<br>
monohydric alcohols with dicarboxylic acids; diesters which are esters of monobasic<br>
acids with polyalcohols such as glycerol; and mixtures of two or more such compounds,<br>
among others.<br>
Useful multifunctional coupling agents include, but are not limited to, epoxidized<br>
vegetable oils such as epoxidized soybean oil, epoxidized linseed oil, and mixtures<br>
thereof, among others. In one embodiment, the coupling agent is epoxidized soybean oil.<br>
Epoxidized vegetable oils are commercially available under the tradename Vikoflex™<br>
from Atofina Chemicals (Philadelphia, PA).<br>
If coupling is to be performed, any effective amount of the coupling agent can be<br>
employed. In one embodiment, a stoichiometric amount of the coupling agent relative to<br>
active polymer alkali metal tends to promote maximum coupling. However, more or less<br>
than stoichiometric amounts can be used for varying coupling efficiency where desired<br>
for particular products.<br>
Following completion of the coupling reaction, if any, the polymerization reaction<br>
mixture can be treated with a terminating agent such as water, carbon dioxide, alcohol,<br>
phenols, or linear saturated aliphatic mono-dicarboxylic acids, to remove alkali metal<br>
from the block copolymer or for color control.<br>
After termination, if any, the polymer cement (polymer in polymerization solvent)<br>
usually contains about 10 to 40 weight percent solids, more usually 20 to 35 weight<br>
percent solids. The polymer cement can be flashed to evaporate a portion of the solvent<br>
so as to increase the solids content to a concentration of about 50 to about 99 weight<br>
percent solids, followed by vacuum oven or devolatilizing extruder drying to remove the<br>
remaining solvent.<br>
The block copolymer can be recovered and worked into a desired shape, such as<br>
by milling, extrusion, or injection molding. The block copolymer can also contain<br>
additives such as antioxidants, antiblocking agents, release agents, fillers, extenders, and<br>
dyes, and the like.<br>
In the present invention, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer<br>
can be polymodal, that is, a population of block copolymer molecules can have two or<br>
more peaks in a histogram of the population's molecular weight distribution, or it can be<br>
monomodal, that is, a population of block copolymer molecules can have one peak in a<br>
histogram of the population's molecular weight distribution. In one embodiment, the<br>
monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer can be polymodal, such as biomodal<br>
(having two peaks in the molecular weight distribution histogram).<br>
In the present invention, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer<br>
can be coupled, as described above.<br>
In the present invention, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer<br>
can have at least one tapered block. In one embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated<br>
diene block copolymer has from 1 to 3 tapered blocks, inclusive. In another embodiment,<br>
the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer comprises two or three tapered<br>
blocks. In one embodiment, the monovinylarene- conjugated diene block copolymer<br>
comprises two or three tapered blocks which are adjacent (i.e., directly bonded to each<br>
other)<br>
The monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer can have a blocky<br>
monovinylarene content of less than about 90 wt%. The blocky monovinylarene content<br>
is defined as the weight of monovinylarene units whose two nearest neighbors on the<br>
polymer chain are both monovinylarene units, divided by the total weight of<br>
monovinylarene units in the copolymer, with the quotient expressed as a percentage.<br>
The blocky monovinylarene content can be measured by H-l NMR, as described in more<br>
detail in the Examples.<br>
In one embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer<br>
comprises a terminal monovinylarene block having a molecular weight of less than<br>
60,000 g/mol. A terminal block is a block resident at an end of a polymer chain. In one<br>
embodiment, the terminal block can be the temporally-first block prepared during<br>
polymerization of the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer, i.e., the block<br>
formed as a result of the temporally-first charge to the reaction vessel. In one<br>
embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer comprises two<br>
terminal monovinylarene blocks.<br>
As stated above, the composition can comprise from about 25 parts by weight to<br>
about 95 parts by weight of the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer. In<br>
one embodiment, the composition can comprise from about 30 parts by weight to about<br>
80 parts by weight of the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer. In one<br>
embodiment, the composition can comprise from about 35 parts by weight to about 75<br>
parts by weight of the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer. In one<br>
embodiment, the composition can comprise from about 40 parts by weight to about 70<br>
parts by weight of the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer. In a further<br>
embodiment, the composition can comprise from about 45 parts by weight to about 65<br>
parts by weight. In one embodiment, the composition can comprise from about 70 parts<br>
by weight to about 90 parts by weight.<br>
The monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer can comprise from about<br>
20 wt% to about 30 wt% conjugated diene units. If the copolymer contains only<br>
monovinylarene and conjugated diene units, it can comprise from about 70 wt% to about<br>
90 wt% monovinylarene units. In one embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated<br>
diene block copolymer can comprise from about 75 wt% to about 80 wt%<br>
monovinylarene units. In another embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene<br>
block copolymer can comprise from about 70 wt% to about 75 wt% monovinylarene<br>
units. In still another embodiment, the monovinylarene-conjugated diene block<br>
copolymer can comprise from about 80 wt% to about 85 wt% monovinylarene units.<br>
The monovinylarene-conjugated diene block copolymer can further comprise<br>
other units known in the art for inclusion in monovinylarene-conjugated diene block<br>
copolymers.<br>
The composition also comprises a monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate<br>
copolymer, by which is meant a polymer comprising (ii-a) monovinylarene units and (iib)<br>
either alkyl acrylate units, alkyl methacrylate units, or both.<br>
The monovinylarene units of the monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer<br>
are as described above. In one embodiment, the monovinylarene units are styrene units.<br>
The alkyl acrylate units or alkyl methacrylate units can be incorporated into the<br>
monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer by free radical polymerization (such as<br>
processes comprising the use of free-radical generating peroxide catalysts such as<br>
benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, or di-t-butyl peroxide, among others, at temperatures<br>
generally lower than those described above), although this is not limiting and use of other<br>
polymerization techniques can be a matter of routine experimentation for the skilled<br>
artisan having the benefit of the present disclosure.<br>

copolymer.<br>
The monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer can further comprise other<br>
units known in the art to be suitable for inclusion in such copolymers.<br>
The monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer can be prepared by free<br>
radical polymerization, as described above, or by other techniques known to the skilled<br>
artisan. The monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer can be a block copolymer,<br>
and the blocks can be monoblocks, random blocks, tapered blocks, or stepwise blocks, as<br>
described above.<br>
As stated above, the composition can comprise from about 5 parts by weight to<br>
about 75 parts by weight of the monovinylarene-alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer. In one<br>

comprise other polymers.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition further comprises from about 0.1 parts by<br>
weight to about 20 parts by weight of a monovinylarene-conjugated diene rubber. A<br>

The polymers described above can be combined by any appropriate technique. In<br>
one embodiment, pellets of each polymer are combined by mechanical mixing prior to<br>
introduction of the mix into the plasticating screw of the converting equipment in use.<br>
One example of converting equipment is a sheet extruder. This mechanical mixing can<br>
be performed by stirring the polymer components, tumbling the components,<br>
simultaneous metering of the components, or by a combination of these techniques. The<br>
mechanical mixing can take place separate from or as an integral part of the feed hopper<br>
of the plasticating screw of the converting equipment.<br>
In another embodiment, the individual polymers can be introduced into a<br>
compounding extruder to produce pellets, each of which contains some quantity of each<br>
of the individual polymers. These compounded pellets may then be introduced into the<br>
plasticating screw of the converting equipment in use. The compounding extruder melts<br>
the individual polymers and mixes them together in the molten state to produce pellets<br>
which are reasonably homogeneous in their blend composition. The individual polymers<br>
may be introduced into the compounding extruder through the feed hopper using the<br>
mechanical mixing techniques previously described, or by use of side feed extruders<br>
metering one or more of the melted components directly into the barrel of the<br>
compounding extruder.<br>
In addition to the polymers described above, the composition can further comprise<br>
a solvent or solvents, one or more of various additives known in the art to be suitable for<br>
inclusion with such a composition, or the like, as a matter of routine experimentation for<br>
the ordinary skilled artisan.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a film, comprising a layer,<br>
comprising a composition as described above. "Film" is used herein to refer to any<br>
extruded material having a relatively thin structure and comprising the composition as a<br>
component of at least one layer of the film. The extruded material can be flexible or<br>
rigid, monolayer or multilayer, molded or unmolded, raw or processed into a structure<br>
suitable for end-use, or the like and be a film under this definition, Materials informally<br>
referred to in the industry as "sheets" are films under this definition.<br>
In one embodiment, the film is a shrink film, that is, the film has been oriented in<br>
at least one direction.<br>
A shrink film or shrink label, used interchangeably herein, is a film portion which<br>
will shrink in at least one direction upon exposure to heat. The terms "shrink film" or<br>
"shrink label" encompass such a film portion before, during, or after heat exposure and<br>
decrease in the length or the width. Before heat exposure, the shrink film can be referred<br>
to as an "unshrunk shrink film" while also being a shrink film according to the definition<br>
given above. The thickness of the shrink film can be any appropriate thickness, such as<br>
from about O.I mil to about 10 mil.<br>
The shrink film can have any structure, such as a patch-like structure or a<br>
cylindrical structure. When the shrink film has a cylindrical structure, it can be termed a<br>
shrink sleeve.<br>
Any geometry of the shrink film, in terms of size, shape, number of sides, radius,<br>
or the like, is contemplated, and will be matter of routine experimentation for the skilled<br>
artisan having the benefit of the present disclosure.<br>
A film can be produced by any technique known in the art of monolayer and<br>
coextruded film making; and if the film is a shrink film, it can be oriented by any<br>
technique known in the art of uniaxial and biaxial orientation. A film can have a machine<br>
direction ("MD") (the direction in which the film comes off the production apparatus)<br>
and a transverse direction ("TD") (the direction perpendicular to the machine direction).<br>
Generally, a shrink film oriented in the TD can be called a "sleeve label". In one<br>
embodiment, the sleeve label can be printed and slit in the MD direction. Solvent<br>
bonding can then be used to form a seam parallel to the TD and make a sleeve. The<br>
sleeve can be applied from the top of a container, resulting in the TD direction of the film<br>
around the circumference of the container. The materials making up a sleeve label can be<br>
chosen to have a desirable degree of shrinkage.<br>
Generally, a shrink film oriented in the MD can be called a "roll fed" label. A roil<br>
fed label can be fed in the machine direction from a roll into a labeling machine. The<br>
labeling machine can wrap the roll fed label around a container, cut the roll fed label, and<br>
solvent bond the roll fed label, with the MD direction of the film around the<br>
circumference of the container.<br>
Generally, a shrink film can be produced by sheet extrusion, followed by<br>
tentering; or blown or cast film techniques (with or without additional orientation steps).<br>
For example, a shrink film can be extruded on a sheet extrusion line to form a sheet.<br>
Molten polymer can flow from a flat die across the width of the line and onto a chill roll<br>
stack, which can cool the molten material. It can then be fed directly into an orienter or<br>
trimmed and wound onto a roll for later orientation. The sheet can be fed into a tentering<br>
frame for TD orientation, or an MD orienter, or both. Some tentering frames are capable<br>
of orienting the sheet in the MD and TD directions simultaneously. The finished film is<br>
typically about 0.2 times as thick as the extruded sheet, but this is an observation and not<br>
a statement limiting the present invention.<br>
A shrink film can also be produced using conventional cast film extrusion<br>
techniques. In one embodiment of a cast process, molten material can flow from a flat<br>
die across the width of the line and onto a chilled drum, which can cool the molten<br>
material. It can then be trimmed and wound on a final drum into rolls of film. Typically,<br>
cast film has higher shrinkage in the machine direction than in the transverse direction,<br>
but this is solely an observation of typical films, and not a limiting description of the<br>
invention. Cast films can be oriented in the MD, TD, or both directions, as well.<br>
Commonly, orientation of cast films can be performed by film extrusion followed by<br>
tentering.<br>
In a blown film process, the extrusion process upstream of the die can be similar<br>
to the cast process, but the die and downstream can be different. In an exemplary blown<br>
film process, the die can be annular (circular) and typically point upward. This can<br>
produce a cylindrical tube, which can be collapsed at the top, resulting in a flattened tube.<br>
In a "double bubble" process, the tube can be reinflated, reheated, stretched to introduce<br>
additional orientation, and recollapsed. A collapsed tube or recollapsed tube can have its<br>
edges removed and then be wound into separate rolls of film.<br>
Multi-layer structures, produced by coextrusion, can be produced on sheet<br>
extrusion, blown film, or cast film equipment. In coextrusion, two or more polymers can<br>
be simultaneously extruded through one die. Two or more extruders can be used<br>
simultaneously to feed the die. In coextrusion, various polymer melts can be introduced<br>
into the die under conditions of laminar flow such that there is little intermixing, but<br>
bonding occurs at the interface between the film layers.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of applying a<br>
label to a container, comprising:<br>
shrinking (a) a shrink film, as described above, to (b) at least a portion of the<br>
exterior surface of a container structure.<br>
The container structure can be any structure known in the art for use in storing or<br>
transporting a food, a beverage, or any other product. The container structure has an<br>
interior surface and an exterior surface, wherein at least a portion of the interior surface is<br>
in contact with the product and the exterior surface is generally in greater contact with the<br>
environment. The container structure also can have an opening allowing liquid, solid, or<br>
gas communication between the volume defined by the container structure and the<br>
environment. The opening can be closed with a cap, cork, lid, or other closing item. The<br>
portion of the closing item in contact with the environment can be considered as a<br>
component of the exterior surface of the container structure. Common container<br>
structures include, but are not limited to, bottles, cartons, cups, trays, bags, and boxes,<br>
among others. Common materials from which container structures can be fabricated<br>
include, but are not limited to, glass, paperboard, cardboard, polypropylene, polystyrene,<br>
and polyethylene terephthalate, among others.<br>
The container structure can have any shape. In particular exemplary<br>
embodiments, it can have a substantially cylindrical body, a curved body, a cubic body, a<br>
parellelepipedal body, or a relatively amorphous body, among others. Any of the<br>
foregoing container structures, or any others, can have a neck or gable-top of any shape<br>
or size. Any of the foregoing container structures, or any others, can have an opening of<br>
any shape or size. The opening of any container structure can be closed with a cap, cork,<br>
lid, or other closing item of any shape, size, and closing means. Exemplary closing<br>
means include, but are not limited to, screw caps, corks, pull-tabs, or lids, among others.<br>
As stated above, the shrink label is in contact with at least a portion of the exterior<br>
surface of the container structure. In one embodiment, the portion of the exterior surface<br>
does not define the opening of the container structure. Figure 1 shows a cross sectional<br>
view of an exemplary container structure according to this embodiment. The container<br>
structure 110 can be, e.g., a bottle formed from, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate. The<br>
opening can be sealed by a cap or other seal 112. The shrink label 120 can be in<br>
circumferential contact with the exterior of the container structure 110, including at least<br>
partial contact with the exterior of the base of the container structure 110.<br>
In another embodiment, the portion of the exterior surface defines the opening of<br>
the container structure. Figure 2 shows a cross sectional view of an exemplary container<br>
structure according to this embodiment. The container structure 210 can be, e.g., a bottle<br>
formed from, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate. The opening can be sealed by a cap 212,<br>
and the shrink label 220 can be applied over at least a portion of the cap 212 and adjacent<br>
portions of the exterior of the container structure 210. The shrink label 220 can form a<br>
tamper-evident or safety seal, such as are known for use in packaging pharmaceutical<br>
products and the like, although this is merely one possible use and it will be clear to the<br>
skilled artisan that the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
As a reminder, the embodiments shown in Figures 1-2 are exemplary, and the<br>
invention is not limited thereto. Specifically, other container structure body shapes,<br>
openings, and closing items, as well as other arrangements of the shrink label relative to<br>
the container structure, are within the scope of the claims.<br>
The shrinking step involves positioning the unshrunk shrink label in proximity to<br>
the exterior surface of the container structure, followed by exposing the unshrunk shrink<br>
label to heat. The exposure to heat will lead to shrinking of the shrink label into contact<br>
with the exterior surface. Generally, the shrink film will shrink in the direction in which<br>
it was oriented; for example, if the shrink film was oriented by stretching in the machine<br>
direction, upon exposure to heat, it will shrink in the machine direction.<br>
In one embodiment, positioning the unshrunk shrink label comprises wrapping the<br>
unshrunk shrink label around the container structure. This embodiment can be termed a<br>
"roll fed" embodiment.<br>
In another embodiment, positioning the unshrunk shrink label comprises creating<br>
a sleeve from the unshrunk shrink label and sliding the sleeve over the container<br>
structure. This embodiment can be termed a "shrink sleeve" embodiment.<br>
An example of the "shrink sleeve" embodiment is shown in Figure 3. As shown<br>
in cross section, an unshrunk sleeve 320 is positioned around a container structure 310, to<br>
yield the arrangement shown in the upper portion of Figure 3. After exposing to heat, the<br>
shrink sleeve 320 is shrunk to contact at least a portion of the exterior surface of the<br>
container structure 310. This embodiment is merely exemplary. Any portion of the<br>
exterior surface of the container structure can be contacted by the shrink sleeve after<br>
shrinking; the portion may, but need not, encompass any one or more of the bottom, the<br>
sides, the neck, or the cap or other closing item, among others.<br>
Any temperature which can lead to shrinking of the shrink label can be used in the<br>
shrinking step. In one embodiment, the temperature is less than about 150°C. In a<br>
further embodiment, the temperature is less than about 100°C. In yet a further<br>
embodiment, the temperature is less than about 80°C.<br>
The result of the shrinking step is the container structure with a shrink label<br>
adhered to its exterior surface.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a packaging article,<br>
comprising a layer, comprising a composition as described above.<br>
Any packaging article which can comprise the composition is within the scope of<br>
"packaging article", as used herein. In one embodiment, the packaging article is in the<br>
form of a thermoformed package. Exemplary thermoformed packages include, but are<br>
not limited to, those loosely referred to as "clamshell packages," "lidded trays," or<br>
"blister packs." A typical clamshell package is a closable package consisting of a rigid<br>
top and rigid bottom. The top may be hinged to the bottom using a living hinge or a<br>
mechanical hinge, or the top may be a separate piece. The clamshell may be held in the<br>
closed position by welding, bonding, or mechanical means. The clamshell may be used<br>
for packaging a variety of products including, but not limited to consumer, industrial,<br>
medical, or food products. A typical lidded tray consists of a rigid tray covered by a<br>
flexible lid. The flexible lid may or may not be bonded or sealed to the tray. Lidded<br>
trays may be used for packaging a variety of products including, but not limited to<br>
consumer, industrial, medical, or food products. A typical blister pack consists of a rigid<br>
backing bonded or mechanically attached to a thermoformed plastic blister. Blister packs<br>
may be used for packing a variety of products including, but not limited to consumer,<br>
industrial, medical, or food products. Many other thermoformed packages can exist<br>
which are not readily classifiable into one of the terms given above.<br>
Typically, the wall of the thermoformed packaging article of this embodiment is<br>
both thicker than a shrink film prepared from a similar composition and not oriented,<br>
save by incidental orientation occurring as a result of the sheet extrusion or package<br>
formation process, described in more detail below. However, this is merely a general<br>
observation, not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of packaging a<br>
product, comprising:<br>
forming a layer comprising the composition as described above into a packaging<br>
article structured to receive the product; and<br>
sealing the product into the packaging article.<br>
Forming the composition into the packaging article can be performed by any<br>
technique known in the art. In one embodiment, the composition is provided as pellets,<br>
which can be melted to form a melt, and the melt can then be extruded to yield a film.<br>
The film can then be molded, according to the product for which packaging is desired, to<br>
yield a packaging article, such as a clamshell package or a blister pack, structured to<br>
receive the product. Structuring the packaging article to receive the product is a routine<br>
matter for the skilled artisan having the benefit of the present disclosure. The structure<br>
will vary depending on the product to be packaged, the type of the packaging article, and<br>
the like.<br>
Sealing the product into the packaging article can be performed by any technique,<br>
depending on the product and the packaging article, among other parameters. In a<br>
clamshell package, the product generally can be fit into the portion of the receiving<br>
structure in one half of the package; the other half of the package is closed around the<br>
product; and the package is sealed by heating, welding, solvent bonding, adhesive<br>
bonding, mechanical sealing such as stapling, or other techniques known in the art, or a<br>
combination of two or more of the foregoing. If the packaging article is a blister pack,<br>
the structure for receiving the product typically comprises a portion of the blister pack.<br>
In a blister pack, the product is generally fit between the blister pack and the rigid<br>
backing (the latter commonly being cardboard or paperboard, although other materials<br>
can be used in blister backings), and the package is sealed, such as by the techniques<br>
referred to above for sealing a clamshell package.<br>
The following examples are included to demonstrate specific embodiments of the<br>
invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques<br>
disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor<br>
to function well in the practice of the invention. However, those of skill in the art should,<br>
in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the<br>
specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
Materials and methods<br>
Blocky monovinylarene content (or monovinylarene blockiness), as stated above,<br>
is the proportion of the monovinylarene units of a polymer whose two nearest neighbors<br>
in the polymer chain are both monovinylarene units. The monovinylarene blockiness is<br>
determined after using H-l NMR to measure two experimental quantities as follows.<br>
First, the total number of monovinylarene units (i.e. arbitrary instrument units<br>
which cancel out when ratioed) is determined by integrating the total monovinylarene<br>
aromatic signal in the H-l NMR spectrum from 7.5 to 6.2 ppm and dividing this quantity<br>
by x, wherein x is the number of hydrogen atoms on the arene ring.<br>
Second, the blocky monovinylarene units are determined by integrating that<br>
portion of the aromatic signal in the H-l NMR spectrum from the signal minimum<br>
between 6.88 and 6.80 to 6.2 ppm and dividing this quantity by, e.g., 2 to account for the<br>
2 ortho hydrogens on each blocky styrene aromatic ring (or other divisor, routinely<br>
determined by the skilled artisan and depending on the monovinylarene units known to<br>
be in the polymer). The assignment of this signal to the two ortho hydrogens on the rings<br>
of those styrene units which have two styrene nearest neighbors was reported in F. A.<br>
Bovey, High Resolution NMR of Macromolecules (Academic Press, New York and<br>
London, 1972), chapter 6. The monovinylarene blockiness is simply the percentage of<br>
blocky monovinylarene to total monovinylarene units:<br>
Blocky %=100 * (Blocky Monovinylarene Units/Total Monovinylarene Units)<br>
Quantities of reagents are expressed in parts per hundred monomer (phm) based<br>
on the total weight of monovinylarene and conjugated diene employed. Peak molecular<br>
weights were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography from a conventional<br>
calibration curve generated with commercial polystyrene standards. Tetrahydrofuran was<br>
used as eluent at room temperature.<br>
Examples 1-5<br>
Styrene and 1,3-butadiene were dried by passage over activated alumina.<br>
Styrene/butadiene block copolymers were prepared employing a sequential solution<br>
polymerization. Polymerization runs were carried out under nitrogen in a stirred,<br>
jacketed, stainless steel 2.5-gallon reactor employing essentially anhydrous reactants and<br>
conditions. The anhydrous mixtures were stirred continuously during the polymerization<br>
process. About 75% of the total amount of cyclohexane solvent was charged initially.<br>
The remaining cyclohexane was added during the run as a diluent or flush for the various<br>
reactants added in subsequent steps. The cyclohexane was preheated to about 50°C<br>
before monomers were charged to the reactor. For each polymerization nin, a total of<br>
approximately 2000 grams of monomers (butadiene and styrene) were used.<br>
Tetrahydrofuran was charged as a 20% solution in cyclohexane. The n-butyllithium was<br>
charged as a 2% solution in cyclohexane. After each addition of monomer, initiator or<br>
additive, the feed lines were rinsed with approximately 90 grams of cyclohexane solvent<br>
and cleared with a nitrogen sparge. After each charge of monomer or monomer mixture<br>
polymerization was allowed to continue to completion prior to the next addition of<br>
monomer or reagent. After the Styrene 1 charge had completely polymerized a sample<br>
was withdrawn from the reactor and coagulated in nitrogen-purged isopropyl alcohol to<br>
determine peak molecular weight by Gel Permeation Chromatography. In the<br>
polymerization step(s) in which both butadiene and styrene were charged, they were<br>
charged simultaneously.<br>
In the coupling step, epoxidized soybean oil Vikoflex® 7170 from Atofma was<br>
charged as a 50% solution in cyclohexane. In the terminating step, water was added in an<br>
amount slightly in stoichiometric excess of the initiator to separate the lithium residues<br>
from the polymer chain. Carbon dioxide was also added at about 0.4 phm to the reactor<br>
from a pressurized cylinder.<br>
The antioxidant mixture added in the stabilizing step contained a hindered phenol,<br>
Irganox 1010 a product of Ciba Specialty Chemicals, added at 0.2 phm and an organic<br>
phosphite, tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite available from GE Specialty Chemicals added at<br>
0.5 phm.<br>
Following the stabilization step, each copolymer solution was flashed at 178 -<br>
180°C to remove a portion of the solvent. Substantially all of the remaining solvent was<br>
removed in a vacuum oven by drying at 90°C for one hour. The resulting polymer was<br>
chopped in a granulator into crumb size and then dried for an additional hour in a vacuum<br>
oven.<br>
The recipes for the Example and Comparative Example copolymers are described<br>
in Table 1. Butadiene and styrene charges enclosed in parentheses are simultaneous<br>
charges that produce tapered butadiene/styrene blocks. Table 2 reports the recipes of the<br>
binary and ternary blends.<br>

BA, Styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer; SBMA, Styrene-butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymer<br>
Testing of the di- and triblends emphasized characterization of toughness, optical<br>
properties, and stiffness of sheet extruded from the various blends. The extruded sheet<br>
utilized in all the testing was 0.025" thick.<br>
An indication of toughness was given by consideration of MTS Impact, Gardner<br>
Impact, and Tensile Break Strain (Table 3). An indication of optical clarity was given by<br>
consideration of % Haze, % Light Transmission, and % Clarity, with % Clarity having<br>
the best correlation to visual inspection of these blends (Table 4). An indication of color<br>
was given by consideration of Hunter "b" color, and Hunter "-b" color (Table 4). An<br>
indication of stiffness was given by Tensile Modulus (Table 3).<br>
MTS Impact was a high speed puncture test, similar to that described by ASTM<br>
D3763. MTS Impact used hydraulic actuation of the tup to achieve an approximately<br>
constant speed. The sample was clamped in an aperture of 3" diameter and a tup with<br>
1.5" diameter was driven through the sample at a controlled speed. The tup penetrated<br>
the sample at a speed of approximately 100 inches per second. Transducers recorded the<br>
forces experienced by the tup and its position as a function of time, allowing calculation<br>
of the total energy required for the tup to penetrate the sample. This "Total Energy"<br>
measurement can be used as one comparative measure of toughness.<br>
Gardner Impact was a falling weight impact test. The Gardner Impact testing<br>
used in development of the comparative data complied with the requirements of ASTM<br>
D5420, using a striker diameter of 0.625" and an aperture ring diameter of 0.640". The<br>
Gardner Impact measurement can be used as one comparative measure of toughness.<br>
Tensile Break Strain was a low speed test, measuring the amount of tensile<br>
elongation required to break the sample. The Tensile Break Strain testing used in<br>
development of the comparative data complied with the requirements of ASTM D638,<br>
using the Type IV specimen geometry and speed of 2 inches per minute. Elongation of<br>
the sheet sample was tested along the extrusion machine direction, abbreviated as "MD".<br>
Elongation was also tested along a direction 90 degrees from MD referred to as the<br>
transverse direction, abbreviated as "TD". Tensile Break Strain MD and Tensile Break<br>
Strain TD can be used as one comparative measure of toughness.<br>
Tensile Modulus testing used in development of the comparative data complied<br>
with the requirements of ASTM D638, using the Type IV specimen geometry and speed<br>
of 2 inches per minute. This measurement can be used as one comparative measure of<br>
stiffness.<br>
Measurements of Tensile Break Strength, Tensile Yield Strain, and Tensile Yield<br>
Strength complied with the requirements of ASTM D638, using the Type IV specimen<br>

Example 6<br>
Shrink sleeve label materials comprising Chevron Phillips K-Resin® were tested<br>
on either a lab scale line which ran a continuous sheet of film which was stretched to<br>
varying degrees or on a pilot scale batch process in which individual samples were<br>
stretched in one or both directions to the desired length. In comparison to the state of the<br>
art, PETG is known to have high shrinkage at temperatures below 100°C.<br>
One exemplary test focused on 50/50 blends by weight parts of (i) a styrenebutadiene<br>
copolymer (K-Resin® DK11) or (ii) a styrene-butadiene tapered copolymer<br>
(K-Resin® DK13) with (a) styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer containing 10 - 17.5 wt%<br>
butyl acrylate (SBA-a) or (b) styrene-butyl acrylate copolymer containing 17.5 - 25 wt%<br>
butyl acrylate (SBA-b). Five stretching temperatures (75°C, 80°C, 85°C, 90°C, and<br>
95°C); two stretch ratios (4:1 and 5:1); and two stretch rates (50% per second and 25%<br>
per second) were tested. Table 5 summarizes the maximum shrinkage values obtained:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 5, 50/50 blends by weight parts of OKI 1 or DK13 with SBA-b<br>
were roughly comparable in shrink properties to PETG.<br>
Figure 4 compares blends containing DK11 and blends containing DK13. DK13<br>
exhibited lower shrink initiation and maximum shrinkage at or below 100°C.<br>
Figure 5 provides a further comparison between DK11 and DK13 blends, and also<br>
shows the effect of SB A level and shrinkage.<br>
Figure 6 shows the effect of SBA level in a blend with DK13.<br>
