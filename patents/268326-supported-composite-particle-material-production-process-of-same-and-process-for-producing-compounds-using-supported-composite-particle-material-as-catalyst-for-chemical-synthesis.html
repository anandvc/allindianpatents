SPECIFICATION<br>
SUPPORTED COMPOSITE PARTICLE MATERIAL, PRODUCTION PROCESS OF<br>
SAME AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING COMPOUNDS USING SUPPORTED<br>
COMPOSITE PARTICLE MATERIAL AS CATALYST FOR CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001 ]<br>
The present invention relates to a supported composite particle material in<br>
which composite particle formed of an oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at<br>
least one type of elements selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium,<br>
platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) is supported onto a support, a process<br>
for producing the supported composite particle material, and a process for producing<br>
compounds, using the supported composite particle material as a catalyst for<br>
chemical synthesis.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Nickel or nickel compounds are widely used as catalysts for chemical synthesis<br>
such as in oxidation reactions, reduction reactions, hydrogenation reactions or the like.<br>
Conventional examples of the use of nickel or nickel compounds in oxidation<br>
reactions may include: (1) an alcohol oxidation reaction in which nickel peroxide<br>
(NiO2) is used as a stoichiometric oxidizing agent (Non-Patent Document 1), (2) an<br>
alcohol aerobic oxidation reaction using Ni-AI hydrotalcite as a catalyst (Non-Patent<br>
Document 2), (3) an alcohol aerobic oxidation reaction using Mg-AI hydrotalcite<br>
containing Ni(ll) as a catalyst (Non-Patent Document 3), and (4) an alcohol aerobic<br>
oxidation reaction using nickel peroxide (NiO2) nanoparticles as a catalyst<br><br>
(Non-Patent Document 4).<br>
As described in (1) above, highly oxidized nickel peroxide has a higher level of<br>
oxidizing power than nickel oxide, and has long been known to be able to oxidize<br>
various alcohols stoichiometrically. This type of nickel peroxide has not been<br>
obtained in pure form or in the form of an anhydride, there are many aspects of its<br>
structure that remain unclear, and is also said to be a nickel oxide that has adsorbed<br>
oxygen. However, since nickel peroxide is extremely useful as a stoichiometric<br>
oxidizing agent, if it were possible to catalytically generate active oxidizing active<br>
species using moleculer oxygen for the oxidizing agent, it would be able to be applied<br>
to aerobic oxidation of numerous organic substrates.<br>
Catalytic alcohol aerobic oxidation reactions have been realized in recent years<br>
as a result of various modifications and improvements to nickel-based catalysts. The<br>
nickel-hydrotalcite-based catalysts described in (2) and (3) above realize highly<br>
efficient activation of moleculer oxygen by compounding Ni with dissimilar metal<br>
elements (such as Al or Mg), thereby achieving aerobic oxidation with a<br>
heterogeneous nickel catalyst. In these catalysts, Ni functions as an oxygen<br>
activation site as a result of compounding Ni with a dissimilar metal element, and is<br>
thought to result in the formation of peroxo species serving as reactive species on the<br>
Ni. In addition, in the method described in (4) above using nickel peroxide, the<br>
reaction has been reported to proceed catalytically as a result of forming the nickel<br>
oxide into nanoparticles.<br>
In the chemical industry, the use of nickel and nickel compounds is not limited to<br>
alcohol oxidation reactions, but have also been shown to be widely effective in various<br>
reactions such as various oxidation reactions, reduction reactions and hydrogenation<br>
reactions, as well as in catalysts for purification of automobile exhaust gas and in<br>
photocatalysts.<br><br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0004]<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
However, the known methods described above do not necessarily have<br>
adequate target product selectivity or catalyst activity, and are unlikely to be<br>
considered as industrially advantageous methods. In addition, in consideration of<br>
the objective of realizing a reduction in the amount of active ingredient used and high<br>
reactivity, nickel and nickel compounds used as catalysts are generally used by<br>
dispersing and supporting onto a support in order to increase specific surface area<br>
and enhance usage efficiency during use as catalyst components. Although<br>
supports on which nickel or nickel compounds are supported are of various types<br>
depending on reaction characteristics and application, these supports have problems<br>
such as not always being able to obtain satisfactory reaction activity or catalyst active<br>
ingredients being susceptible to dropout from the support depending on the<br>
distribution of catalyst components within the support.<br>
The present inventors conducted extensive studies on the supported composite<br>
particle material of the present application, in which composite particles comprising<br>
oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one of elements selected from<br>
the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper)<br>
are supported onto a support, based on the premise of practical application thereof in<br><br>
an industrial process. As a result, in the case of using as a catalyst for chemical<br>
synthesis, since a supported composite particle material in which composite particles<br>
are uniformly supported on the inside of a support inhibit diffusion of reaction raw<br>
materials and reaction products due to the resistance of pores inside the support,<br>
composite particles supported inside a support are not used effectively, and such<br>
supported composite particle material has been clearly demonstrated to prevent the<br>
obtaining of catalysts that are not necessarily satisfactory from the viewpoint of<br>
reaction activity. In addition, the composite particles supported onto the outer<br>
surface of support particles were determined to have problems such as a loss of<br>
activity due to concealment of active sites due to the adsorption of reaction<br>
by-products and accumulation of toxic substances depending on the type of reaction<br>
or type of reaction apparatus and the like, and a loss of catalyst activity due to<br>
composite particles dropping out from the support due to wear caused by collisions<br>
between support particles and between support particles and reactor walls and the<br>
like.<br>
[0005]<br>
With the foregoing in view, an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
supported composite particle material that maintains high reactivity for a long period of<br>
time by stably supporting composite particles comprised of an oxidized nickel and X<br>
(wherein X represents at least one of elements selected from the group consisting of<br>
nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) on a support, a<br>
process for producing the supported composite particle material, and a process for<br>
producing compounds using the supported composite particle material as a catalyst<br>
for chemical synthesis.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0010]<br>
The following provides an explanation of the best mode for carrying out the<br>
present invention (to be referred to as "the present embodiment"). The following<br>
embodiment is exemplified for explaining the present invention, and is not intended to<br>
limit the present invention to only this embodiment. The present invention can be<br><br>
carried out in various forms without deviating from the gist thereof.<br>
[0011]<br>
[Supported Composite Particle Material]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
comprises composite particles comprised of an oxidized nickel and X (wherein X<br>
represents at least one of elements selected from the group consisting of nickel,<br>
palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper) and a support on which the<br>
composite particles are supported, and has a supported layer in which the composite<br>
particle is localized.<br>
[0012]<br>
The term "supported layer in which the composite particles are localized" used<br>
herein refers to a region in the support in which the composite particles are<br>
concentrated. In the supported composite particle material according to the present<br>
embodiment, since the composite particles are not randomly supported in the support,<br>
but rather selectively supported in a fixed region, this region is generically referred to<br>
as a "supported layer in which the composite particles are localized". In the<br>
supported composite particle material, since a region is a "supported layer in which<br>
the composite particles are localized" provided the composite particles are<br>
concentrated in a fixed region as compared with other portions, which region is a<br>
"supported layer in which the composite particles are localized" can be determined by<br>
X-ray microprobe analysis to be described later or from secondary electron reflected<br>
images obtained with a high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The<br>
supported layer in which the composite particles are localized is preferably present in<br>
a region extending from the surface of the supported composite particle material to<br>
40% of the equivalent diameter of the supported composite particle material. If the<br>
supported layer in which the composite particles are localized is present in this region,<br><br>
the effects of diffusion rates of the reactants within the support are reduced, which<br>
tends to improve reaction activity.<br>
[0013]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
can have various sizes and various shapes such that the substantial thickness of<br>
particle diameter is on the µm to cm order. Specific examples of the shape of the<br>
supported composite particle material may include various shapes such as spheres,<br>
ovals, cylinders, tablets, hollow cylinders, plates, rods, sheets, honeycombs or the like.<br>
The shape of the supported composite particle material can be suitably changed<br>
according to the reaction form, and in a fixed bed reaction, for example, hollow<br>
cylindrical or honeycomb-shaped particles are selected due to their low pressure loss,<br>
while spherical particles are typically selected under conditions of suspending in a<br>
liquid phase slurry.<br>
[0014]<br>
The term "equivalent diameter" used herein refers to the diameter of spherical<br>
particles, or in the case of irregularly shaped particles, the diameter of a sphere<br>
having an equal volume as the particles or having a surface area equal to the surface<br>
area of the particles. Equivalent diameter is measured by measuring the mean<br>
particle diameter (volume-based) using a laser diffraction/scattering particle size<br>
distribution measuring apparatus and using the resulting value as the equivalent<br>
diameter. Alternatively, number average particle diameter as measured with a<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM) can also be used to represent equivalent<br>
diameter.<br>
[0015]<br>
The thickness of the supported layer in which the composite particles are<br>
localized is selected to an optimum range according to the thickness of the support,<br>
particle diameter, type of reaction and reaction form. Furthermore, since the<br><br>
"equivalent diameter of the supported composite particle material" is usually the same<br>
as the "equivalent diameter of the support", the "equivalent diameter of the supported<br>
composite particle material" can be determined from the equivalent diameter of the<br>
support.<br>
[0016]<br>
For example, in the case of using a support of a size such that the thickness of<br>
the support exceeds 200 µm (for example several mm or more), the supported<br>
composite particle material is generally used in a liquid phase reaction having a<br>
comparatively slow reaction rate or in a vapor phase reaction. Thus, by providing a<br>
region in which the active component in the form of composite particles extend from<br>
the surface of the supported composite particle material to 40% of the equivalent<br>
diameter of the supported composite particle material, and a layer in which the<br>
composite particles are supported to 80 µm from the outer surface of the supported<br>
composite particle material but not supported inside the supported composite particle<br>
material, the supported composite particle material can be obtained that is resistant to<br>
the effects of the diffusion rates of the reactants. As a result, the composite particles<br>
can be used effectively.<br>
[0017]<br>
On the other hand, in the case the thickness of the support is 200 µm or less, the<br>
composite particles are preferably supported in a region extending from the surface of<br>
the supported composite particle material to 30% of the equivalent diameter of the<br>
supported composite particle material. In the case of using in a liquid phase reaction<br>
in particular, the support was conventionally designed to have a small particle<br>
diameter in line with the reaction due to the effects of the reaction rate and the<br>
intrapore diffusion rates of reactants within the support. In the present embodiment,<br>
a highly active supported composite particle material can be obtained without<br><br>
reducing the particle diameter of the support by reducing the thickness of the<br>
supported layer in which the composite particles are localized. Namely, according to<br>
the present embodiment, it becomes easy to separate the catalyst by settling, thereby<br>
resulting in the advantage of enabling separation to be carried out using a<br>
small-volume separator. However, if the volume of the portion of composite particles<br>
in the supported composite particle material that are not supported becomes<br>
excessively large, the volume not required by the reaction per container increases,<br>
thereby resulting in waste. Thus, it is preferable to set the particle diameter of the<br>
support, the required thickness of the supported layer in which composite particles are<br>
localized and the thickness of the layer in which composite particles are not supported<br>
according to the reaction form.<br>
[0018]<br>
The supported composite particle material may also have an outer layer<br>
substantially free of composite particles on the outside of the supported layer in which<br>
composite particles are localized. The outer layer is preferably formed at a thickness<br>
of 0.01 to 15 µm from the outer surface of the support. As a result of providing the<br>
outer layer within this range, the supported composite particle material can be used as<br>
a catalyst strongly resistant to catalyst poisoning that inhibits the loss of composite<br>
particles due to abrasion in reactions using reactors such as a fluidized bed, bubble<br>
column, stirring reactor or other reactor for which there is the risk of friction of catalyst<br>
particles, and in reactions in which there is accumulation of catalytic poisons. In<br>
addition, since the outer layer can be controlled to be extremely thin, large decreases<br>
in activity can be suppressed.<br>
[0019]<br>
The thickness of the outer layer substantially free of composite particles is<br>
selected to an optimum range according to the reaction characteristics, physical<br><br>
properties of the support, loading of composite particles and the like, and is preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 15 µm, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 µm, and even more preferably<br>
from 0.2 to 5 µm. If the thickness of the outer layer (composite<br>
particle-non-supported layer) exceeds 15 µm, although there is no change in the<br>
effect of improving catalyst life when using the composite particles as a catalyst, this<br>
leads to a decrease in catalyst activity. If the thickness of the outer layer is less than<br>
0.01 urn, susceptibility to loss of catalyst particles due to abrasion tends to increase.<br>
[00020]<br>
In the present embodiment, the term "substantially free of composite particles"<br>
used herein refers to the substantial absence of a peak indicating the distribution<br>
oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one of elements selected from<br>
the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper)<br>
having a relative intensity of 10% or more in X-ray microprobe analysis to be<br>
described later or in secondary electron reflected images obtained with a<br>
high-resolution scanning electron microscope.<br>
[0021]<br>
The composite particles of the present embodiment are particles comprised of<br>
an oxidized nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one of elements selected from<br>
the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and<br>
copper).<br>
[0022]<br>
Preferable examples of the oxidized nickel may include nickel oxides formed by<br>
bonding nickel and oxygen (such as Ni2O, NiO, NiO2, Ni3O4 or Ni2O3), and composite<br>
oxides containing nickel such as nickel oxide compounds formed by bonding nickel<br>
and X and/or one or more types of other metal elements and oxygen, or a solid<br>
solution or mixture thereof.<br>
[0023]<br><br>
The term "nickel oxide" used herein refers to a compound containing nickel and<br>
oxygen. Nickel oxides may include the previously exemplified Ni2O, NiO, NiO2,<br>
Ni3O4 or Ni2O3 or hydrates thereof, hydroperoxides of nickel containing an OOH group,<br>
peroxides of nickel containing an O2 group, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0024]<br>
In addition, the term "composite oxide" used herein refers to an oxide containing<br>
two or more types of metals. The term "composite oxide" used herein refers to an<br>
oxide in which two or more types of metal oxides form a compound, and although it<br>
includes multiple oxides not containing an ion of an oxoacid as a structural unit (such<br>
as pervoskite oxides and spinel oxides of nickel), it refers to that having a broader<br>
context than multiple oxides, and includes all oxides in which two or more types of<br>
metals are compounded. Oxides in which two or more types of metal oxides form a<br>
solid solution are also within the scope of composite oxides.<br>

The present inventors found that, in the case of using the supported composite<br>
particle material according to the present embodiment as a catalyst for synthesis of<br>
carboxylic acid esters, by compounding nickel oxide with X, the inherent catalytic<br>
ability of nickel oxides having oxidative esterification activity can be brought out and a<br>
remarkably high level of catalyst performance can be demonstrated unlike that<br>
realized with a catalyst comprised of each component alone. This is thought to be a<br>
unique effect demonstrated as a result of compounding a nickel compound and X that<br>
is the result of a novel catalyst action completely different from that demonstrated by<br>
each component alone due to a dual functional effect between both metal<br>
components or the formation of a new active species. On the basis of this novel<br>
concept, in the case of supporting oxidized nickel and X on a support in a highly<br>
dispersed state, astonishing catalyst performance unable to be obtained with<br><br>
conventional catalysts was able to be realized.<br>
[0026]<br>
For example, if gold is selected for X and nickel oxide and gold are supported<br>
onto a support in a highly dispersed state, remarkably high catalyst performance<br>
appears. This catalyst was observed to demonstrate a high degree of carboxylic<br>
acid ester selectivity and a considerable improvement in activity at a specific<br>
composite ratio of Ni/Au as compared with respectively supporting nickel oxide or gold<br>
alone onto a support. The catalyst also demonstrates high catalytic activity per metal<br>
atom as compared with support particles comprised of each component alone, and<br>
the appearance of catalyst performance as a result of their compounding is strongly<br>
dependent on the supported composition of nickel and gold. This is presumed to be<br>
due to the presence of an optimum ratio for the formation of a nickel oxidation state<br>
that is optimum for the reaction. In this manner, highly prominent compounding<br>
effects, which cannot be predicted from the simple combined addition of each<br>
component alone, are demonstrated as a result of dispersing two components<br>
comprising the nickel oxide and gold and supporting onto a support.<br>
[0027]<br>
The supported composite particle material in which gold is selected for X have<br>
the oxidized nickel and gold supported onto a support in a highly dispersed state, and<br>
both components have been observed to be compounded at the nanometer level.<br>
Based on the results of transmission electron microscope/scanning transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM/STEM) observations, nearly spherical nanoparticles<br>
measuring 2 to 3 nm are uniformly dispersed and supported on a support. According<br>
to an elementary analysis of the nanoparticles by energy dispersive X-ray<br>
spectrometry (EDS), all of the particles were observed to contain nickel and gold, and<br>
the nickel was observed to be coating the surface of gold nanoparticles. In addition,<br><br>
a nickel component alone was also observed to be supported onto the support in<br>
addition to the nanoparticles containing nickel and gold.<br>
[0028]<br>
According to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and powder<br>
X-ray diffraction (XRD), although gold is present in the form of a crystalline metal,<br>
nickel is presumed to be present in the form of an amorphous oxide having a<br>
bivalence.<br>
[0029]<br>
On the basis of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), a surface plasmon<br>
absorption peak (at about 530 nm) originating from gold nanoparticles observed in<br>
gold nanoparticles of a single metal species was determined to disappear when nickel<br>
oxide and gold were compounded. The phenomenon involving disappearance of<br>
this surface plasmon absorption peak was not observed in catalysts comprised of<br>
combinations of gold and metal oxide species other than nickel oxide not observed to<br>
have an effect on the reaction (including metal oxides such as chromium oxide,<br>
manganese oxide, iron oxide, cobalt oxide, copper oxide or zinc oxide). The<br>
disappearance of this surface plasmon absorption peak is thought to be the result of<br>
the formation of a mixed electron state mediated by the contact interface between<br>
oxidized nickel and gold, or in other words, the result of hybridization of two types of<br>
metallic chemical species.<br>
[0030]<br>
Conversion to highly oxidized nickel oxide can be confirmed by a color change<br>
of a catalyst and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). As a result of adding gold<br>
to nickel oxide, the nickel oxide changed in color from grayish green to brown, and the<br>
UV spectrum demonstrated absorbance over nearly the entire visible light region.<br>
The shape of the UV spectrum and the color of the catalyst were similar to that of<br>
highly oxidized nickel oxide (NiO2) measured as a reference sample. On the basis of<br><br>
this finding, nickel is presumed to be converted to a highly oxidized nickel oxide by the<br>
addition of gold.<br>
[0031]<br>
On the basis of the above results, the structure of the composite particles in the<br>
case of selecting gold for X is believed to be such that the gold particles serve as the<br>
core and the surface thereof is coated with highly oxidized nickel oxide, without any<br>
gold atoms present on the surface of the composite particles.<br>
[0032]<br>
The supported composition of nickel and X onto a support is preferably within a<br>
range of from 0.20 to 0.99, more preferably within a range of from 0.30 to 0.90, and<br>
even more preferably within a range of from 0.50 to 0.90, in terms of the atomic ratio<br>
of Ni/(Ni + X). The term "atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + X)" used herein refers to a ratio of<br>
the number of atoms of nickel supported onto the support to the total number of atoms<br>
of nickel and X.<br>
[0033]<br>
The composite particles are preferably supported onto the support in a highly<br>
dispersed state. The composite particles are more preferably supported by being<br>
dispersed in the form of microparticles or a thin film, and the mean particle diameter<br>
thereof is preferably from 2 to 10 nm, more preferably from 2 to 8 nm, and even more<br>
preferably from 2 to 6 nm.<br>
If the mean particle diameter of the composite particles is within the above<br>
ranges, a specific active species structure comprised of nickel and X is formed and<br>
reaction activity tends to improve. Here, mean particle diameter in the present<br>
embodiment refers to the number average particle diameter as measured with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM). More specifically, in an image observed<br>
with a transmission electron microscope, area of black contrast indicate composite<br>
particles, and the mean particle diameter thereof can be calculated by measuring the<br><br>
diameter of each particle for all particles.<br>
[0034]<br>
The composition of nickel and X in the composite particles is preferably within a<br>
range of from 0.1 to 10, more preferably within a range of from 0.2 to 5.0 and even<br>
more preferably within a range of from 0.3 to 3.0 in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni/X.<br>
If the atomic ratio of Ni/X is within the above ranges, a specific active species<br>
structure comprised of nickel and X and a nickel oxidized state optimum for the<br>
reaction are formed, and as a result thereof, activity and selectivity tend to be higher<br>
than a supported composite particle material comprised of nickel and X outside the<br>
above ranges.<br>
[0035]<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the form of the composite<br>
particles provided both of the components of nickel and X are contained therein,<br>
preferably both components are present in the particles, and the particles are in a<br>
form having a phase structure, such as a solid solution structure in which chemical<br>
species randomly occupy crystal sites, a core-shell structure in which each chemical<br>
species is separated in the shape of concentric spheres, a anisotropic phase<br>
separation structure in which phases are separated anisotropically, or a<br>
heterobondphilic structure in which both chemical species are present adjacent to<br>
each other on the particle surface. More preferably, the composite particles have a<br>
form in which they have a core comprised of X and oxidized nickel is coated onto the<br>
surface of the cores. There are no particular limitations on the shape of the<br>
composite particles provided both components are contained therein, and the shape<br>
may be spherical or hemispherical and the like.<br>
[0036]<br>
As previously described, transmission electron microscopy/scanning<br>
transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM), for example, is effective as an<br><br>
analysis technique for observing the form of the composite particles, and elementary<br>
analyses within the particles and extraction of images of the distribution of elements<br>
therein are possible by irradiating nanoparticles observed by TEM/STEM with an<br>
electron beam. The composite particles of the present embodiment contain nickel<br>
and X in all of the particles thereof as will be indicated in the examples to be described<br>
later, and have been confirmed to have a form in which the surface of X is coated with<br>
nickel. In the case of having such a form, the atomic ratio of nickel and X varies<br>
according to the locations of the composition analysis points in the particles, and<br>
nickel is detected in larger amounts on the edges of the particles than in the central<br>
portion thereof. Thus, there are variations in the atomic ratio of nickel and X<br>
depending on the locations of the analysis points even among individual particles, and<br>
the range thereof is included in the range of the atomic ratio of Ni/X as previously<br>
described.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the case of having selected gold, silver or copper for X, ultraviolet-visible<br>
spectroscopy (UV-Vis) is an effective means of identifying the structure thereof. In<br>
the case of nanoparticles of gold, silver or copper alone, coupling occurs between the<br>
photoelectric field of the visible to near infrared region and free electrons on the<br>
surface of the metal resulting in the occurrence of surface plasmon absorption. For<br>
example, when a catalyst supported with gold particles is irradiated with visible light,<br>
an absorption spectrum is observed that is based on plasmon resonance originating<br>
from gold particles at a wavelength of about 530 nm. However, in the supported<br>
composite particle material in which nickel oxide and gold are supported according to<br>
the present embodiment, since the surface plasmon absorption thereof disappears,<br>
gold can be considered to not be present on the surface of the composite particles of<br>
the present embodiment.<br><br>
[0038]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the solid form of the nickel provided the<br>
prescribed activity is obtained, and is preferably in an amorphous form in which<br>
diffraction peaks are not observed in X-ray diffraction. As a result of having such a<br>
form, in the case of using as a catalyst of an oxidation reaction, interaction with<br>
oxygen is presumed to increase, and since the bonding interface between the<br>
oxidized nickel and X increases, even better activity tends to be obtained.<br>
[0039]<br>
In the present embodiment, X is at least one of elements selected from the<br>
group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, gold, silver and copper,<br>
and is more preferably selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium,<br>
ruthenium, gold and silver.<br>
[0040]<br>
Although the chemical state of X may be a metal, an oxide, an hydroxide, a<br>
composite oxide containing X and nickel or one or more types of another metal<br>
element, or a mixture thereof, the chemical state of X is preferably a metal or oxide,<br>
and more preferably a metal. In addition, there are no particular limitations on the<br>
solid form of X provided the prescribed activity is obtained, the form may be either a<br>
crystalline form or an amorphous form.<br>
[0041]<br>
The term "another metal element" used herein refers to a constituent element of<br>
a support to be described later, a third component other than oxidized nickel and X<br>
contained in the supported composite particle material, or a metal component such as<br>
an alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal or rare earth metal.<br>
[0042]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
has oxidized nickel and X supported onto a support as previously described, and<br><br>
demonstrates superior effects as a result of forming composite particles comprised of<br>
oxidized nickel and X. Furthermore, the term "composite particle" used herein refers<br>
to a particle containing different binary metal species in a single particle. Examples<br>
of different binary metal species may include binary metal particles in which both the<br>
nickel and X are metals and metal particles forming an alloy or intermetallic compound<br>
of nickel and X, and the case of using these as catalysts for chemical synthesis, the<br>
selectivity of the target product and the activity of the catalyst tend to be lower than the<br>
supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment.<br>
[0043]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
preferably contains oxidized nickel alone on the support in addition to the composite<br>
particles comprised of oxidized nickel and X. The presence of oxidized nickel not<br>
compound with X further enhances the structural stability of the supported particles,<br>
and inhibits increases in pore diameter caused by prolonged reactions as well as the<br>
accompanying growth of the composite particles. This effect is particularly<br>
remarkable in the case of using an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
containing silica and alumina for the support as will be described later.<br>
[0044]<br>
The following provides an explanation of mechanism that enhances structural<br>
stability of the supported composite particle material and that inhibits increases in<br>
pore diameter caused by prolonged reactions as well as the accompanying growth of<br>
composite particles by having oxidized nickel alone present on a support.<br>
[0045]<br>
As will be described later, in a synthesis reaction of a carboxylic acid ester, by<br>
adding a compound of an alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal to the reaction system<br>
to maintain a pH of the reaction system at 6 to 9, and more preferably to neutral<br>
conditions (for example, pH 6.5 to 7.5), namely as close to pH 7 as possible, it is<br><br>
possible to inhibit the production of acetals and other by-products caused by acidic<br>
substances exemplified by methacrylic acid or acrylic acid that are unique by-products<br>
of carboxylic acid ester production reactions.<br>
[0046]<br>
According to studies conducted by the present inventors, in the case of carrying<br>
out a prolonged reaction according to the reaction procedure described above using a<br>
supported gold particle material in which single-component gold particles are<br>
supported onto a support comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based<br>
composition containing silica and alumina, structural changes were determined to<br>
occur, although gradually, in the supported gold particle material. This phenomenon<br>
is thought to be caused by an increase in pore diameter of the supported particle<br>
material due to the supported particle material being locally and repeatedly exposed<br>
to acid and base causing a portion of the Al in the support to dissolve and precipitate<br>
and resulting in rearrangement of the silica-alumina crosslinked structure. In<br>
addition, accompanying changes causing an increase in pore diameter, sintering of<br>
the gold particles occurs, and this was determined to lead to a decrease in catalyst<br>
activity due to a decrease in surface area.<br>
[0047]<br>
On the other hand, the presence of composite particles and oxidized nickel<br>
alone on the support enhanced the structural stability of the supported particle<br>
material according to the reaction procedure described above, thereby inhibiting<br>
increases in pore diameter and growth of the composite particles. As was previously<br>
described, the formation of nickel oxide compounds or composite oxides containing<br>
nickel in the form of a solid solution and the like as result of oxidized nickel reacting<br>
with constituent elements of the support is considered to be factor behind the reason<br>
for this, and as a result of such nickel compounds acting to stabilize the silica-alumina<br><br>
crosslinked structure, structural changes in the supported particle material are thought<br>
to have greatly improved. The present inventors presumed that the appearance of<br>
this support structure stabilizing effect is attributable to the oxidized nickel present in<br>
the support. Consequently, although this effect is naturally obtained in the case<br>
oxidized nickel contained in composite particles is in contact with the support, even<br>
greater stabilizing effects are thought to be obtained in the case oxidized nickel is<br>
present alone on the support.<br>
[0048]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the support of the supported composite<br>
particle material according to the present embodiment provided oxidized nickel and X<br>
can be supported onto the support, and conventional catalyst supports used for<br>
chemical synthesis can be used.<br>
[0049]<br>
Examples of supports may include various types of supports such as activated<br>
charcoal, silica, alumina, silica-alumina, titania, silica-titania, zirconia, magnesia,<br>
silica-magnesia, silica-alumina-magnesia, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, zeolite,<br>
crystalline metallosilicate or the like. Preferable examples of supports may include<br>
activated charcoal, silica, alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia,<br>
silica-alumina-magnesia, titania, silica-titania and zirconia. More preferable<br>
examples may include silica-alumina and silica-alumina-magnesia.<br>
[0050]<br>
In addition, one or a plurality of types of metal components selected from the<br>
group consisting of alkaline metals (Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs), alkaline earth metals (Be, Mg,<br>
Ca, Sr or Ba) and rare earth metals (La, Ce or Pr) may be contained in the support.<br>
Metal components that become oxides as a result of firing, such as nitrates or<br>
acetates, are preferably used for the metal components supported onto the support.<br>
[0051]<br><br>
A support comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
containing silica and aluminum is preferably used for the support. The support has<br>
higher water resistance than silica and higher acid resistance than alumina. In<br>
addition, the support is provided with properties superior to supports typically used in<br>
the prior art, including greater hardness and higher mechanical strength than<br>
activated charcoal, and is also able to stably support the active components in the<br>
form of oxidized nickel and X. As a result, the reactivity of the supported composite<br>
particle material can be maintained over a long period of time.<br>
[0052]<br>
The supported composite particle material having a specific atomic ratio for<br>
oxidized nickel and X and using an aluminum-containing silica-based composition for<br>
the support has high mechanical strength, is physically stable and satisfies corrosion<br>
resistance with respect to liquid properties unique to the reaction despite having a<br>
large surface area suitable for use as a catalyst support in the case of using as a<br>
catalyst for chemical synthesis.<br>
[0053]<br>
The following provides an explanation of the characteristics of a support<br>
comprised of an alumina-containing silica-based composition containing silica and<br>
alumina of the present embodiment capable of considerably improving catalyst life.<br>
Reasons for being able to greatly improve the mechanical strength and chemical<br>
stability of the support are as described below.<br>
[0054]<br>
The support comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
contains newly formed Si-O-AI-O-Si bonds resulting from the addition of aluminum<br>
(Al) to a non-crosslinked silica (Si-O) chain of a silica gel, and as a result of an<br>
Al-crosslinked structure having been formed without any loss of the inherent stability<br>
to acidic substances of the Si-0 chain, it is thought that the Si-O bonds are<br><br>
strengthened, thereby resulting in a considerable improvement in the stability of<br>
hydrolysis resistance (to be simply referred to as "water resistance"). In addition,<br>
when a Si-O-AI-O-Si crosslinked structure is formed, the number of non-crosslinked<br>
Si-0 chains decreases in comparison with the case of silica gel alone, and this is<br>
thought to increase mechanical strength. Namely, there is presumed to be a<br>
correlation between the number of Si-O-AI-O-Si structures formed and improvement<br>
of the mechanical strength and water resistance of the resulting silica gel.<br>
[0055]<br>
One of the reasons for it being possible to stably support the oxidized nickel and<br>
X on a support for a long period of time is that the mechanical strength and chemical<br>
stability of the support are greatly improved as previously described, enabling it to be<br>
provided with superior physical properties in comparison with typically used supports<br>
of the prior art. As a result, it is difficult for the active components in the form of<br>
nickel and X to separate from the support, which is thought to enable the nickel and X<br>
to be stably supported over a long period of time.<br>
[0056]<br>
In the case of typically used supports such as silica or silica-titania, nickel<br>
components are observed to elute from the support, although gradually, in prolonged<br>
reactions. In contrast, in the case of using the support described above, the present<br>
inventors found that elution of nickel components is suppressed over a long period of<br>
time. On the basis of the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),<br>
transmission electron microscopy (TEM/EDX) and high-resolution X-ray fluorescence<br>
(HRXRF), in the case of using a silica or silica-titania support, eluted nickel<br>
components were confirmed to be nickel oxide present alone on the support. Since<br>
nickel oxide is a soluble compound in acid, in the case of using as a catalyst for<br>
carboxylic acid ester synthesis, it is presumed to be eluted by acidic substances<br><br>
exemplified by methacrylic acid or acrylic acid that are unique by-products of the<br>
reaction.<br>
[0057]<br>
On the basis of analyses of the chemical state of nickel by high-resolution X-ray<br>
fluorescence (HRXRF), the nickel in the supported composite particle material<br>
according to the present embodiment is presumed to not contain a single compound<br>
in the form of nickel oxide alone, but rather form composite oxides containing nickel<br>
such oxidized compounds of nickel formed as a result of bonding between nickel<br>
oxide and constituent component elements of the support, or a solid solution or<br>
mixture thereof.<br>
[0058]<br>
High-resolution X-ray fluorescence (HRXRF) has extremely high energy<br>
resolution and is able to analyze chemical state from the energy levels (chemical<br>
shifts) and shapes of the resulting spectrum. In the Ka spectra of 3d transition metal<br>
elements in particular, changes appear in chemical shift and shape due to changes in<br>
valence or electronic state, thereby making it possible analyze the chemical state in<br>
detail. In the supported composite particle material according to the present<br>
embodiment, changes appear in the Ni Ka spectrum, and a chemical state was<br>
confirmed for nickel that differs from that of a single compound in the form of nickel<br>
oxide.<br>
[0059]<br>
For example, nickel aluminate, which is formed from nickel oxide and alumina, is<br>
a compound that is insoluble in acid. As a result of forming such a nickel compound<br>
on a support, elution of nickel components is presumed to be greatly improved.<br>
[0060]<br>
In a preferable elementary composition of the support comprised of an<br>
aluminum-containing silica-based composition containing silica and alumina, the<br><br>
amount of aluminum is from 1 to 30 mol%, preferably from 5 to 30 mol% and more<br>
preferably from 5 to 25 mol% based on the total molar amount of silicon and aluminum.<br>
If the amount of aluminum is within the above ranges, acid resistance and mechanical<br>
strength tend to be satisfactory.<br>
[0061]<br>
In addition, the support in the supported composite particle material according to<br>
the present embodiment preferably further contains an oxide of at least one of basic<br>
metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and<br>
rare earth metals, in addition to silica and alumina, from the viewpoint of further<br>
improving mechanical strength and chemical stability. Examples of alkaline metals of<br>
the basic metal components may include Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs, examples of alkaline<br>
earth metals may include Be, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba, while examples of rare earth metals<br>
may include La, Ce and Pr.<br>
[0062]<br>
In the elementary composition of the support containing silica, alumina and at<br>
least one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, the amount of aluminum is from 1 to 30<br>
mol%, preferably from 5 to 30 mol% and more preferably from 5 to 25 mol% based on<br>
the total molar amount of silicon and aluminum. In addition, the compositional ratio<br>
of basic metal oxide to alumina, in terms of the atomic ratio of (alkaline metal + 1/2 x<br>
alkaline earth metal + 1/3 x rare earth metal) / Al, is preferably within a range of from<br>
0.5 to 10, more preferably within a range of from 0.5 to 5.0 and even more preferably<br>
within a range of from 0.5 to 2.0. If the elementary composition of silica, alumina and<br>
basic metal oxide is within the above ranges, the silicon, aluminum and basic metal<br>
oxide form a specific stable bonding structure, and as a result thereof, the mechanical<br>
strength and water resistance of the support tend to be satisfactory.<br>
[0063]<br><br>
The following provides an explanation of a preferable method for preparing a<br>
support having a composition as described above.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method for preparing a support<br>
comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based composition containing silica and<br>
alumina, and an aluminum-containing silica-based composition obtained according to<br>
any of (1) to (5) below can be prepared by firing under conditions to be described later.<br>
(1)	Use of a commercially available silica-alumina compound solution<br>
(2)	Reacting a silica sol with an aluminum compound solution<br>
(3)	Reacting a silica sol with an aluminum compound insoluble in water<br>
(4)	Reacting a silica gel with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble aluminum<br>
compound<br>
(5)	Reacting a silica gel and an aluminum compound in a solid phase reaction<br>
[0064]<br>
The following provides a detailed explanation of the support preparation<br>
methods referred to in (2) to (5) above.<br>
In the methods of (2) to (5) above, a silica sol or silica gel is used for the silica<br>
source. The silica gel is that having non-crosslinked Si sites that react with Al, and<br>
there are no particular restrictions on the length of the Si-0 chain. Although<br>
water-soluble compounds such as sodium aluminate, aluminum chloride hexahydrate,<br>
aluminum perchlorate hexahydrate, aluminum sulfate, aluminum nitrate nonahydrate<br>
or aluminum diacetate are preferable for the aluminum compound, compounds that<br>
are insoluble in water, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide, can also be<br>
used provided they are compounds that react with non-crosslinked Si in the silica sol<br>
and silica gel.<br>
[0065]<br>
In the case of the methods of (2) and (3) that use a silica sol as a starting<br><br>
material, after obtaining a mixed sol containing silica sol and an aluminum compound<br>
by mixing the silica sol and an aluminum compound, the mixed sol is subjected to a<br>
hydrothermal reaction at 20 to 100°C for 1 to 48 hours and dried to obtain a gel<br>
followed by firing under temperature, time and atmospheric conditions to be described<br>
later. Alternatively, an alkaline aqueous solution is added to the above-mentioned<br>
mixed sol followed by co-precipitating silica and an aluminum compound, drying and<br>
firing under conditions to be described later. In addition, a support comprised of an<br>
aluminum-containing silica-based composition having a desired particle diameter can<br>
be obtained by either pulverizing the above-mentioned mixed sol directly using a<br>
spray dryer or by a step in which the mixed sol is dried following by granulating the<br>
gel.<br>
[0066]<br>
In the case of the method of (3) in particular, although a silica sol is reacted with<br>
an aluminum compound insoluble in water, at this time the aluminum compound can<br>
be pulverized in advance to a prescribed particle diameter or can be preliminarily<br>
coarsely pulverized. After mixing and reacting the silica sol and the water-insoluble<br>
aluminum compound and drying, the mixture is further fired under conditions to be<br>
described later. The fired silica-alumina compound may also be pulverized to a<br>
prescribed particle diameter without pre-pulverizing the aluminum compound.<br>
[0067]<br>
In the case of the method of (4) using a silica gel for the starting material, an<br>
aqueous solution of a water-soluble aluminum compound is reacted with the silica gel,<br>
and the silica gel may be pulverized to a prescribed particle diameter in advance, or<br>
may be preliminarily coarsely pulverized. After mixing and reacting the silica gel with<br>
the water-soluble aluminum compound at 20 to 100°C for 1 to 48 hours, the mixture is<br>
dried and further fired for 1 to 48 hours under conditions to be described later. The<br><br>
fired silica-alumina compound may also be pulverized to a prescribed particle<br>
diameter without preliminarily pulverizing the silica gel.<br>
[0068]<br>
The method of (5), which similarly uses a silica gel for the starting material,<br>
involves the preparation of an aluminum-containing silica composition by reacting the<br>
silica gel with an aluminum compound in a solid phase reaction. The Al is reacted in<br>
a solid phase state with non-crosslinked Si. The silica gel and the aluminum<br>
compound may be pulverized to a prescribed particle diameter in advance. In<br>
addition, they may also be preliminarily coarsely pulverized. Pulverization may be<br>
carried out for each substance alone or may be carried out after mixing both<br>
substances. Firing is carried out under temperature, time and atmospheric<br>
conditions to be described later.	After the reaction, the resulting<br>
aluminum-containing silica composition can also be used after pulverizing to a<br>
prescribed particle diameter following the reaction without preliminarily pulverizing the<br>
silica gel and aluminum compound.<br>
[0069]<br>
In a method for preparing a support containing silica, alumina and an oxide of at<br>
least one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, the support can be prepared by drying a<br>
slurry obtained by mixing an alkaline metal oxide, alkaline earth metal oxide and/or<br>
rare earth metal oxide into silica and aluminum components and then firing under<br>
conditions to be described later in accordance with the above-mentioned method for<br>
preparing a support comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based composition<br>
containing silica and alumina.<br>
[0070]<br>
Atypical commercially available compound can be used as a raw material of the<br>
alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal or rare earth metal in the same manner as the<br><br>
aluminum raw materials. The raw material is preferably a water-soluble compound<br>
and more preferably a hydroxide, carbonate, nitrate or acetate.<br>
[0071]<br>
In another preparation method that can be used, a basic metal component<br>
selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare<br>
earth metals is adsorbed onto a support comprised of an aluminum-containing<br>
silica-based composition. For example, a method using an immersion method in<br>
which a support is added to a liquid in which is dissolved a basic metal compound<br>
followed by drying treatment, or a method using an impregnation method in which a<br>
basic metal compound equivalent to pore volume is worked into a support followed by<br>
drying treatment, can be applied. However, a method in which the basic metal<br>
component is adsorbed later requires caution in that liquid drying treatment must be<br>
carried out under mild conditions after having highly dispersed the basic metal<br>
component in the support.<br>
[0072]<br>
In addition, inorganic substances or organic substances can be added to the<br>
mixed slurry of each of the raw materials described above in order to control slurry<br>
properties and finely adjust the pore structure or other characteristics of the product or<br>
the properties of the resulting support.<br>
[0073]<br>
Specific examples of inorganic substances used may include inorganic acids<br>
such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, salts of metals such as alkaline<br>
metals such as Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs or alkaline earth metals such as Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba,<br>
water-soluble compounds such as ammonia or ammonium nitrate, and clay minerals<br>
that form a suspension by being dispersed in water. In addition, specific examples of<br>
organic substances may include polymers such as polyethylene glycol, methyl<br>
cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide or the like.<br><br>
[0074]<br>
Although there are various effects of adding inorganic substances or organic<br>
substances, the main effects include the formation of a spherical support and<br>
controlling pore diameter and pore volume. More specifically, the liquid properties of<br>
the mixed slurry are an important factor in obtaining a spherical support. Adjusting<br>
viscosity and solid content using an inorganic substance or inorganic substance<br>
makes it possible to alter the liquid properties to facilitate the obtaining of a spherical<br>
support. In addition, pore diameter and pore volume can be controlled by selecting<br>
the optimum organic compound that remains inside the support at the molding stage<br>
after which residual substances are able to be removed during firing after molding and<br>
by washing.<br>
[0075]<br>
The support can be produced by spray-drying the mixed slurry of each raw<br>
material and additive described above. A known spraying device of, for example, a<br>
rotating disk type, two-fluid nozzle type or pressurized nozzle type can be used as the<br>
method for converting the mixed slurry into liquid droplets.<br>
[0076]<br>
The liquid to be sprayed is required to be used in a well-mixed state. If the<br>
liquid is not properly mixed, it affects the performance of the support, such as<br>
decreased durability caused by uneven distribution of components. When<br>
formulating the raw materials in particular, increases in slurry viscosity or partial<br>
gelling (colloidal condensation) may occur, resulting in the risk of the formation of<br>
non-uniform particles. Consequently, in addition to taking into consideration<br>
gradually mixing the raw materials while stirring, for example, controlling a pH to a<br>
semi-stable region of the silica sol such as around pH 2 may be preferable by using a<br>
method such as adding acid or alkali.<br>
[0077]<br><br>
The liquid to be sprayed is also required to have a certain degree of viscosity<br>
and solid content. If viscosity and solid content are excessively low, the porous body<br>
obtained by spray-drying may not form a perfect sphere and instead may form<br>
numerous indentations therein. In addition, if viscosity and solid content are<br>
excessively high, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the dispersibility of<br>
porous bodies, stable droplets are unable to be formed depending on the properties<br>
thereof. Consequently, the viscosity is preferably within a range of from 5 to 10,000<br>
cps provided the liquid is able to be sprayed, and in terms of shape, higher viscosities<br>
tend to be preferable provided the liquid is able to be sprayed, while in consideration<br>
of the balance with ease of manipulation, the viscosity is selected to be within a range<br>
of from 10 to 1,000 cps. In addition, a solid content within a range of from 10 to 50%<br>
by mass is preferable in terms of shape and particle diameter. Furthermore, as a<br>
general reference for spray-drying conditions, the hot air temperature at the entrance<br>
to the drying tower of the spray dryer is preferably within a range of from 200 to 280°C,<br>
and the drying tower outlet temperature is preferably within a range of from 110 to<br>
140°C.<br>
[0078]<br>
The support firing temperature is typically selected to be within a range of from<br>
200 to 800°C. If the support is fired at a temperature above 800°C, specific surface<br>
area tends to decrease considerably, thereby making this undesirable. In addition,<br>
although there are no particular limitations on the firing atmosphere, firing is typically<br>
carried out in air or nitrogen. In addition, although the firing time can be determined<br>
according to the specific surface area after firing, it is generally from 1 to 48 hours.<br>
Since firing conditions cause changes in the porosity and other properties of the<br>
support, it is necessary to select suitable temperature conditions and heating<br>
conditions. If the firing temperature is too low, it tends to be difficult to maintain<br><br>
durability as a composite oxide, while if the firing temperature is too high, there is the<br>
risk of causing a decrease in pore volume. In addition, heating conditions are<br>
preferably such that the temperature rises gradually by using a heating program and<br>
the like. In the case of firing under extremely high temperature conditions,<br>
gasification and combustion of inorganic substances and organic substances<br>
becomes violent, thereby exposing the support to a high-temperature state beyond<br>
that which has been set and causing the support to be pulverized.<br>
[0079]<br>
From the viewpoints of ease of supporting composite particles, reaction activity<br>
in the case of using as a catalyst, resistance to separation and reaction activity, the<br>
specific surface area of the support is preferably 10 m2/g or more, more preferably 20<br>
m2/g or more, and even more preferably 50 m2/g or more as measured by BET<br>
nitrogen adsorption. Although there are no particular limitations on specific surface<br>
area from the viewpoint of activity, from the viewpoints of mechanical strength and<br>
durability, the specific surface area is preferably 700 m2/g or less, more preferably 350<br>
m2/g or less and even more preferably 300 m2/g or less.<br>
[0080]<br>
The pore structure of the support is an extremely important property in terms of<br>
long-term stability, including supporting characteristics of metal components other<br>
than strength, as well as reaction characteristics. Pore diameter is a physical<br>
property value required to demonstrate these characteristics. If pore diameter is<br>
smaller than 3 nm, although the separation properties of the supported metal tend to<br>
be satisfactory, in the case of using as a catalyst in a liquid phase reaction and the like,<br>
pore diameter is preferably 3 nm or more from the viewpoint of not making the<br>
intrapore diffusion resistance excessively great so that the diffusion process of the<br>
reaction substrate is not rate-limiting as well as maintaining reaction activity at a high<br><br>
level. On the other hand, the pore diameter is preferably 50 nm or less from the<br>
viewpoints of resistance to cracking of the supported material and resistance to<br>
separation of the supported metal. Thus, the pore diameter of the support is<br>
preferably from 3 to 50 nm, and more preferably from 3 to 30 nm. Pore volume is<br>
required for the presence of pores capable of supporting compounded nanoparticles.<br>
However, if pore volume is excessively large, a tendency is observed for strength to<br>
suddenly decrease. Thus, from the viewpoints of strength and supporting<br>
characteristics, pore volume is preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 1.0 mL/g and<br>
more preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 0.5 mL/g. The support of the present<br>
embodiment preferably satisfies the above ranges for both pore diameter and pore<br>
volume.<br>
[0081]<br>
The shape of the support is selected according to the reaction form, selecting a<br>
hollow cylindrical support or honeycomb structure resulting in little pressure loss in the<br>
case of a fixed bed reaction, while under conditions of a liquid phase slurry<br>
suspension, a spherical shape is generally selected after selecting the optimum<br>
particle diameter in consideration of reactivity and the separation method. For<br>
example, in the case of employing a generally simple catalyst separation process<br>
based on precipitation separation, a particle diameter of from 10 to 20 µm is preferably<br>
selected, that of from 20 to 150 µm is more preferably selected and that of from 30 to<br>
150 µm is even more preferably selected based on the balance with reaction<br>
characteristics. In the case of a cross filter reaction, small particles of 0.1 to 20 µm or<br>
less are preferable since they yield higher reactivity. The supported composite<br>
particle material can thus be used as a catalyst for chemical synthesis by changing<br>
the type and form of the support according to the purpose of use.<br>
[0082]<br><br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the loading of oxidized nickel on<br>
the support, the loading of oxidized nickel is generally from 0.01 to 20% by mass,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 10% by mass, more preferably from 0.2 to 5% by mass and<br>
even more preferably 0.5 to 2% by mass as nickel based on the weight of the support.<br>
The loading of X supported onto the support is generally from 0.01 to 10% by mass,<br>
preferably from 0.1 to 5% by mass, more preferably from 0.2 to 2% by mass, even<br>
more preferably from 0.3 to 1.5% by mass and particularly preferably from 0.5 to 1.0%<br>
by mass as metal based on the weight of the support.<br>
[0083]<br>
Moreover, in the present embodiment, a preferable range exists for the atomic<br>
ratio between nickel and the above-mentioned constituent elements of the support.<br>
In the case of using the support comprised of an aluminum-containing silica-based<br>
composition containing silica and alumina in the present embodiment, the<br>
compositional ratio of nickel and alumina in a catalyst in terms of the atomic ration of<br>
Ni/AI is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.8 and even more<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 0.6. In addition, in the case of using a support containing<br>
silica, alumina and an oxide of at least one of basic metals selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals, the atomic<br>
ratio of nickel and alumina in the supported material in terms of the atomic ratio of<br>
Ni/AI is preferably from 0.01 to 1.0, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.8 and even more<br>
preferably from 0.04 to 0.6, and the compositional ratio of nickel and alkaline metal<br>
component in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni/(alkaline metal + alkaline earth metal +<br>
rare earth metal) is preferably from 0.01 to 1.2, more preferably from 0.02 to 1.0 and<br>
even more preferably from 0.04 to 0.6.<br>
[0084]<br>
If the atomic ratios of nickel to support constituent elements in the form of<br><br>
aluminum and basic metal oxide are within the above ranges, the effects of improving<br>
nickel elution and structural changes in supported particle materials tend to increase.<br>
This is thought to be because the nickel, aluminum and basic metal oxide form a<br>
specific composite oxide within the above ranges, thereby forming a stable bonding<br>
structure.<br>
[0085]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
can also contain a third constituent element in addition to the active components in the<br>
form of oxidized nickel and X. Examples of third constituent elements that can be<br>
contained may include titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, lead, cobalt, zinc,<br>
gallium, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, rhodium, cadmium, indium, tin, antimony,<br>
tellurium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, iridium, mercury, thallium,<br>
lead, bismuth, aluminum, boron, silicon and phosphorous. The content of these third<br>
constituent elements is preferably from 0.01 to 20% by mass and more preferably<br>
from 0.05 to 10% by mass in the supported material. In addition, at least one of<br>
metal component selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth<br>
metals and rare earth metals may also be contained in the supported composite<br>
particle material. The content of alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal or rare earth<br>
metal is preferably selected to be within a range of 15% by mass or less in the<br>
supported material.<br>
[0086]<br>
Furthermore, these third constituent elements or alkaline metal, alkaline earth<br>
metal or rare earth metal may be contained in the supported composite particle<br>
material during production or reaction of the supported composite particle material, or<br>
a method may be used in which they are contained in the support in advance.<br>
[0087]<br>
The specific surface area of the supported composite particle material according<br><br>
to the present embodiment is preferably within a range of from 20 to 350 m2/g, more<br>
preferably from 50 to 300 m2/g and even more preferably from 100 to 250 m2/g as<br>
measured by BET nitrogen adsorption from the viewpoints of reaction activity and<br>
resistance to separation of active components.<br>
[0088]<br>
The pore structure of the supported composite particle material is an extremely<br>
important property in terms of long-term stability, including supporting characteristics<br>
and separation of metal components, as well as reaction characteristics, and pore<br>
diameter is a physical property value required to demonstrate these characteristics.<br>
If pore diameter is smaller than 3 nm, although the separation properties of the<br>
supported metal component tend to be satisfactory, in the case of using as a catalyst<br>
in a liquid phase reaction and the like, pore diameter is preferably 3 nm or more from<br>
the viewpoint of not making the intrapore diffusion resistance excessively great so that<br>
the diffusion process of the reaction substrate is not rate-limiting as well as<br>
maintaining reaction activity at a high level. On the other hand, the pore diameter is<br>
preferably 50 nm or less from the viewpoints of resistance to cracking of the supported<br>
material and resistance to separation of the supported composite particles. Thus,<br>
the pore diameter of the supported composite particle material is preferably from 3 to<br>
50 nm, more preferably from 3 to 30 nm and even more preferably from 3 to 10 nm.<br>
From the viewpoints of supporting characteristics and reaction characteristics, pore<br>
volume is preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 1.0 mL/g, more preferably within a<br>
range of from 0.1 to 0.5 mL/g and even more preferably within a range of from 0.1 to<br>
0.3 mL/g. The supported composite particle material according to the present<br>
embodiment preferably satisfies the above ranges for both pore diameter and pore<br>
volume.<br>
[0089]<br><br>
[Process For Producing Supported Composite Particle Material]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the method used to prepare the supported<br>
composite particle material according to the present embodiment provided a<br>
supported material as described above is obtained. The following provides an<br>
explanation of a typical process for preparing the supported composite particle<br>
material according to the present embodiment.<br>
[0090]<br>
In a first step, an aqueous slurry containing a support supported with an oxide of<br>
at least one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals is mixed with an acidic aqueous solution of<br>
a soluble metal salt containing nickel and X (wherein X represents at least one of<br>
elements selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium,<br>
gold, silver and copper). The temperature of the mixture of both liquids is adjusted<br>
so that the temperature thereof is 60°C and above. A precursor of a supported<br>
composite particle material in which nickel and the X component have precipitated is<br>
formed on the support in the mixture.<br>
[0091]<br>
Next, in a second step, the precursor obtained in the first step is rinsed with<br>
water and dried as necessary followed by subjecting to heat treatment to obtain the<br>
supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment.<br>
[0092]<br>
According to this process, a supported composite particle material can be<br>
obtained that has a supported layer in which the composite particles are localized but<br>
does not contain composite particles in a region that includes the center of the<br>
support.<br>
[0093]<br>
Prior to the first step, the support supported with an oxide of at least one of basic<br><br>
metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and<br>
rare earth metals is preferably aged in water. Aging the support in advance allows<br>
the obtaining of a layer having a sharp distribution of composite particles. Based on<br>
the results of measuring pore distribution by nitrogen adsorption, the effect produced<br>
by aging the support is presumed to be the result of a more uniform and sharper pore<br>
structure due to the occurrence of realignment of the support pore structure.<br>
Although support aging can be carried out at room temperature, due to the slow rate<br>
of changes in the pore structure thereof, a temperature higher than room temperature<br>
is preferably selected within a range of from 60 to 150°C. In the case of aging at<br>
normal pressure, a temperature within a range of from 60 to 100°C is preferable. In<br>
addition, although the duration of aging treatment varies according to the temperature<br>
conditions, it is preferably from 1 minute to 5 hours, more preferably from 1 to 60<br>
minutes and even more preferably from 1 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 90°C, for<br>
example. In the procedure of the first step, although the support can be used after<br>
initially drying and then firing after it has been aged, a slurry in which the support is<br>
dispersed in water is preferably contacted with the acidic aqueous solution of a<br>
soluble metal salt containing nickel and X followed by insoluble fixation of the nickel<br>
and X on the support.<br>
[0094]<br>
Examples of soluble metal salts containing nickel used to prepare a catalyst may<br>
include nickel nitrate, nickel acetate, nickel chloride or the like. In addition, examples<br>
of soluble metal salts containing X may include palladium chloride, palladium acetate<br>
or the like in the case of selecting palladium for X, ruthenium chloride, ruthenium<br>
nitrate or the like in the case of selecting ruthenium for X, chloroauric acid, sodium<br>
tetrachloroaurate, potassium dicyanoaurate, gold diethylamine trichloride, gold<br>
cyanide or the like in the case of selecting gold for X, and silver chloride, silver nitrate<br><br>
or the like in the case of selecting silver for X.<br>
[0095]<br>
The respective concentrations of aqueous solutions containing nickel and X are<br>
generally within a range of from 0.0001 to 1.0 mol/L, preferably from 0.001 to 0.5<br>
mol/L and more preferably from 0.005 to 0.2 mol/L. The ratio of nickel and X in the<br>
aqueous solutions in terms of the atomic ratio of Ni/X is preferably within a range of<br>
from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.2 to 5.0 and more preferably from 0.5 to 3.0.<br>
[0096]<br>
The temperature during contact between the nickel and acidic aqueous solution<br>
of a soluble metal salt containing nickel and X is one important factor for controlling<br>
the distribution of composite particles, and although varying according to the amount<br>
of oxide of at least one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals supported in advance onto the<br>
support, if the temperature is excessively low, the reaction slows and the distribution<br>
of composite particles tends to widen. In the production process according to the<br>
present embodiment, the temperature during contact with the acidic aqueous solution<br>
of a soluble metal salt containing nickel and X, from the viewpoint of obtaining a<br>
supported layer in which the composite particles are more sharply localized, is a<br>
temperature at which the supported composite particle material is obtained at a high<br>
reaction rate, and is preferably 60°C or higher, more preferably 70°C or higher, even<br>
more preferably 80°C or higher and particularly preferably 90°C or higher. Since the<br>
acidic aqueous solution and aqueous slurry are mixed so that the temperature of the<br>
mixed liquid thereof is 60°C or higher, the aqueous slurry may be heated to a degree<br>
such that the mixed liquid exceeds 60°C even after the acidic aqueous solution is<br>
added, or conversely only the acidic aqueous solution may be heated. Both the<br>
acidic aqueous solution and the aqueous slurry may naturally also be heated to 60°C<br><br>
or higher.<br>
[0097]<br>
Although the reaction can be carried out under an applied pressure at a<br>
temperature equal to or higher than the boiling point of the solvent, based on the ease<br>
of the procedure, it is generally preferably carried out at a temperature equal to or<br>
lower than the solvent boiling point. There are no particular limitations on the<br>
duration of fixation of the nickel and X components, and although varying according to<br>
conditions such as the type of support, the loading of nickel and X and the ratio<br>
thereof, the duration is generally within a range of from 1 minute to 5 hours, preferably<br>
from 5 minutes to 3 hours and more preferably from 5 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
[0098]<br>
The production process of the supported composite particle material according<br>
to the present embodiment is based on the principle of insoluble fixation of the nickel<br>
and X components by carrying out a chemical reaction between an oxide of at least<br>
one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline<br>
earth metals and rare earth metals supported in advance on the support, and a<br>
soluble metal salt containing nickel and X. These components are preferably fixed<br>
simultaneously from a mixed solution containing both components in order to ensure<br>
more adequate compounding of the nickel and X.<br>
[0099]<br>
In addition, in the production process according to the present embodiment, the<br>
aqueous slurry containing a support supported with an oxide of at least one of basic<br>
metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and<br>
rare earth metals preferably contains a salt of at least one of basic metals selected<br>
from the group consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth<br>
metals.<br>
[0100]<br><br>
As a result, the formation of metal black of X is inhibited, compounding of nickel<br>
and X is promoted, and the distribution of composite particles can be controlled more<br>
precisely. Such effects are presumed to be caused by controlling the rate of the<br>
chemical reaction between the basic metal oxide supported in advance on the support<br>
and the soluble metal salt containing nickel and X as a result of adding to the aqueous<br>
solution a salt of at least one of metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals.<br>
[0101]<br>
Examples of salts of at least one of basic metals selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals that can be<br>
used may include one or more types selected from water-soluble salts of these metals<br>
such as organic acid salts, nitrates, chlorides or the like.<br>
[0102]<br>
The amount of the salt of at least one of basic metals selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkaline metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals as described<br>
above varies according to the amounts and ratio of the nickel and X components, and<br>
is determined according to the amount of basic metal oxide supported in advance<br>
onto the support. Generally, the amount of the above salt is from 0.001 to 2 times<br>
moles and preferably from 0.005 to 1 times moles based on the amount of nickel and<br>
X components in the aqueous solution.<br>
[0103]<br>
In addition, the aqueous slurry containing a support supported with an oxide of<br>
at least one of basic metals selected from the group consisting of alkaline metals,<br>
alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals preferably contains a soluble aluminum<br>
salt. Examples of soluble aluminum salts that can be used may include aluminum<br>
chloride and aluminum nitrate.<br>
[0104]<br><br>
The addition of a soluble aluminum salt to the aqueous slurry allows the<br>
formation of an outer layer substantially free of composite particles on the outside of<br>
the supported layer in which composite particles are localized. This is also based on<br>
the principle of insoluble fixation as previously described. Aluminum chloride or<br>
aluminum nitrate and the like is used for the soluble aluminum salt, aluminum is<br>
reacted on the outer surface of the support by a chemical reaction with the basic metal<br>
oxide supported in advance onto the support, the nickel and X are consumed thereby,<br>
and the outer layer is fixed by a reaction between the basic metal oxide inside and the<br>
nickel and X.<br>
[0105]<br>
The amount of aluminum component varies according to how many µm the<br>
thickness of the layer not supported with nickel or X component is set to, and is<br>
determined according to the amount of basic metal oxide supported in advance onto<br>
the support. Generally, the amount of aluminum component is from 0.001 to 2 times<br>
moles and preferably from 0.005 to 1 times moles based on the amount of basic metal<br>
oxide supported in advance onto the support.<br>
[0106]<br>
Although there are many aspects of the details of the mechanism by which the<br>
nickel and X components are distributed that are unclear, it is presumed that the<br>
balance with the rate at which the components are insolubilized by a chemical<br>
reaction was effectively attained under the conditions of the present embodiment,<br>
thereby making it possible to fix the composite particles in a narrow region near the<br>
surface of the support.<br>
[0107]<br>
In addition, in the case of forming the outer layer substantially free of composite<br>
particles on the outer surface of the support, since aluminum and a basic metal<br>
component near the outer surface of the support are allowed to react resulting in<br><br>
consumption of basic metal components capable of reacting with nickel and X<br>
components near the outer surface of the support, and when nickel and X are<br>
subsequently supported, the reactive basic metal components near the outer surface<br>
of the support are already consumed, the nickel and X are presumed to be fixed as a<br>
result of reacting with a basic metal compound inside the support.<br>
[0108]<br>
The following provides an explanation of the second step.<br>
The precursor of the supported composite particle material is rinsed with water<br>
and dried as necessary prior to the heat treatment of the second step. The<br>
temperature at which the precursor is heated is generally from 40 to 900°C, preferably<br>
from 80 to 800°C, more preferably from 200 to 700°C and even more preferably from<br>
300 to 600°C.<br>
[0109]<br>
Heat treatment is carried out in an atmosphere such as air (or atmospheric air),<br>
an oxidizing atmosphere (such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide,<br>
hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid or inorganic or organic peroxides), or an inert<br>
gas atmosphere (such as helium, argon or nitrogen). The heating time is suitably<br>
selected according to the heating temperature and amount of precursor. In addition,<br>
heat treatment can be carried out at normal pressure, under applied pressure or under<br>
reduced pressure.<br>
[0110]<br>
Following the second step as described above, reduction treatment can be<br>
carried out in a reducing atmosphere (such as hydrogen, hydrazine, formalin or formic<br>
acid) as necessary. In this case, a treatment method is selected that prevents the<br>
oxidized nickel from being completely reduced to a metallic state. The temperature<br>
and duration of reducing treatment are suitably determined according to the type of<br>
reducing agent, type of X and amount of catalyst.<br><br>
[0111]<br>
Moreover, oxidizing treatment can be carried out following the above-mentioned<br>
heat treatment and reducing treatment in air (or atmospheric air) or an oxidizing<br>
atmosphere (such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, hydrogen<br>
peroxide, hypochlorous acid or inorganic or organic peroxides) as necessary. The<br>
temperature and duration in this case is suitably determined according to the type of<br>
oxidizing agent, type of X and amount of catalyst.<br>
[0112]<br>
A third constituent element other than nickel and X can be added during<br>
production of the supported material or under reaction conditions. The alkaline metal,<br>
alkaline earth metal or rare earth metal can also be added during catalyst preparation<br>
or to the reaction system. In addition, the raw materials of the third constituent<br>
element, alkaline metal, alkaline earth metal and rare earth metal are selected from<br>
salts of organic acids, salts of inorganic acids, hydroxides and the like.<br>
[0113]<br>
As has been described above, according to the supported composite particle<br>
material production process according to the present embodiment, the supported<br>
composite particle material can be obtained having the supported layer in which<br>
composite particles are localized comprised of oxidized nickel and X in specific<br>
shallow region near the outer surface of the support, and as necessary, having a layer<br>
substantially free of the composite particles on the outer surface of the support.<br>
[0114]<br>
[Process for Producing Compounds Using the Supported Composite Particle Material<br>
as a Catalyst for Chemical Synthesis]<br>
The supported composite particle material according to the present embodiment<br>
can be widely used as a catalyst for chemical synthesis. For example, it can be used<br>

[0125]<br>
These reaction substrates can be used alone, or two or more types can be used<br>
as a mixture. In addition, these reaction substrates are not necessarily required to<br>
be purified, and may be in the form of mixtures with other organic compounds.<br>
[0126]<br>
The following provides an explanation of an example of a process for producing<br>
carboxylic acid ester from aldehyde and alcohol in the presence of oxygen by an<br>
oxidative esterification reaction using the supported composite particle material<br>
according to the present embodiment as a catalyst.<br>
[0127]<br>
Examples of the aldehyde used as a raw material may include C1 to C10 aliphatic<br><br>
aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetoaldehyde, propionaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde,<br>
glyoxal or the like; C2 to C10 alicyclic α-β unsaturated aldehydes such as acrolein,<br>
methacrolein, crotonaldehyde or the like; C6 to C20 aromatic aldehydes such as<br>
benzaldehyde, tolylaldehyde, benzylaldehyde, phthalaldehyde or the like; and<br>
derivatives of these aldehydes. These aldehyde can be used alone, or any two or<br>
more types can be used as a mixture.<br>
[0128]<br>
Examples of alcohols may include C1 to C10 aliphatic saturated alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, octanol or the like; C5 to C10<br>
alicyclic alcohols such as cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol or the like; C2 to C10 diols such<br>
as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediol or the like; C3 to C10 aliphatic<br>
unsaturated alcohols such as allyl alcohol, methallyl alcohol or the like; C6 to C20<br>
aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol or the like; and hydroxyoxetanes such as<br>
3-alkyl-3-hydroxymethyloxetane or the like. These alcohols can be used alone, or<br>
any two or more types can be used as a mixture.<br>
[0129]<br>
There are no particular limitations on the weight ratio of aldehyde to alcohol, and<br>
although the reaction can be carried out over a wide range of molar ratios of<br>
aldehyde/alcohol of from 10 to 1/1,000 the reaction is generally carried out within the<br>
range of a molar ratio of from 1/2 to 1/50.<br>
[0130]<br>
The amount of catalyst used can be varied considerably according to, for<br>
example, the types of reaction raw materials, composition and preparation method of<br>
the catalyst, reaction conditions and reaction form, and although there are no<br>
particular limitations thereon, in the case of reacting the catalyst in the form of a slurry,<br>
the amount of catalyst in terms of the solid content in the slurry is preferably within the<br>
range of from 1 to 50 wt/vol%, more preferably from 3 to 30 wt/vol% and even more<br><br>
preferably from 10 to 25 wt/vol%.<br>
[0131]<br>
In the production of carboxylic acid ester, the reaction may be carried out either<br>
in batches or continuously using an arbitrary method such as a vapor phase reaction,<br>
liquid phase reaction or reflux reaction.<br>
[0132]<br>
Although the reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent, it can also be<br>
carried out using a solvent that is inert with respect to the reaction components such<br>
as hexane, decane, benzene, dioxane or the like.<br>
[0133]<br>
A known form such as a fixed bed type, fluidized bed type or stirred tank type<br>
can be used for the reaction form. For example, when carrying out the reaction in a<br>
liquid phase, any type of reactor can be used, such as a bubble column reactor, draft<br>
tube type reactor, stirred tank reactor or the like.<br>
[0134]<br>
The oxygen used to produce carboxylic acid ester can be molecular oxygen,<br>
namely can be in the form of oxygen gas itself or a mixed gas in which the oxygen gas<br>
has been diluted with a diluent that is inactive in the reaction such as nitrogen or<br>
carbon dioxide gas, and air is preferably used for the oxygen raw material from the<br>
viewpoints of ease of manipulation, economy and the like.<br>
[0135]<br>
Although oxygen partial pressure varies according to the reaction raw materials<br>
such as the type of aldehyde or type of alcohol, the reaction conditions or the type of<br>
reactor and the like, the oxygen partial pressure at the reactor outlet is, for practical<br>
reasons, within the range equal to or lower than the lower limit of the explosive range,<br>
and is preferably controlled to, for example, from 20 to 80 kPa. Although reaction<br>
can be carried out at a reaction pressure extending over a wide pressure range from<br><br>
depressurization to pressurization, the reaction is normally carried out at a pressure<br>
within the range of from 0.05 to 2 MPa. In addition, it is preferable from the viewpoint<br>
of safety to set the total pressure so that the oxygen concentration of the reactor<br>
outflow gas does not exceed the explosive limit (for example, a concentration of 8%).<br>
[0136]<br>
In the case of carrying out a carboxylic acid ester production reaction in a liquid<br>
phase, the pH of the reaction system is preferably maintained at from 6 to 9 by adding<br>
a compound of an alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal (such as an oxide, hydroxide,<br>
carbonate or carboxylate) to the reaction system. These alkaline metal or alkaline<br>
earth metal compounds can be used alone, or two or more types can be used in<br>
combination.<br>
[0137]<br>
Although the reaction temperature during production of carboxylic acid ester is<br>
such that the reaction can be carried out at high temperatures above 200°C, the<br>
reaction temperature is preferably from 30 to 200°C, more preferably from 40 to<br>
150°C and even more preferably from 60 to 120°C. There are no particular<br>
limitations on the reaction time, and although not determined unconditionally since it<br>
varies according to the set conditions, it is generally from 1 to 20 hours.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[0138]<br>
Although the following provides a more detailed explanation of the present<br>
embodiment through examples and comparative examples thereof, the present<br>
embodiment is not limited thereto. A person with ordinary skill in the art can not only<br>
carry out the examples indicated below, but also make various changes thereto, and<br>
such changes are also included within the scope of the claims for patent.<br>
[0139]<br><br>
Furthermore, in the examples and comparative examples, measurement of the<br>
distributions of nickel and X in the supported composite particle material, observation<br>
of the form of the support and supported composite particle material, measurement of<br>
mean particle diameter, determination of the loading of Ni and X and atomic ratio of<br>
Ni/(Ni + X), determination of the content of support constituent elements (Si, Al, basic<br>
metal), analysis of the crystal structure of composite particles, analysis of the<br>
chemical state of composite particle metal elements, analysis of the chemical state of<br>
nickel, morphological observation and elementary analysis of composite particles,<br>
measurement of the ultraviolet-visible spectra of composite particles and<br>
measurement of the physical properties of the support and supported composite<br>
particle material (specific surface area, pore diameter, pore volume) were carried out<br>
according to the methods described below.<br>
[0140]<br>
[Measurement of Distributions of Nickel and X in Supported Composite Particle<br>
Material]<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was measured at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV<br>
using the Shimadzu Model 1600 X-ray Microprobe (EPMA). Ni and X (Au) in the<br>
direction of depth from the outer surface were analyzed on the basis of electron<br>
reflected images and X-ray analysis (Ni - wavelength: 14.5829, analyzing crystal:<br>
RAP; X (Au) -wavelength: 5.8419, analyzing crystal: PET).<br>
[0141]<br>
[Morphological Observation of Support and Supported Composite Particle<br>
Material]<br>
The support and supported composite particle material were observed using the<br>
Hitachi X-650 Scanning Electron Microscopy System (SEM).<br>
[0142]<br><br>
[Measurement of Mean Particle Diameter of Support and Supported Composite<br>
Particle Material]<br>
Mean particle diameter (volume-based) was measured using the<br>
Beckman-Coulter Model LS230 Laser Diffraction/Scattering Particle Size Distribution<br>
Measuring System.<br>
[0143]<br>
[Determination of Loading of Ni and X and Atomic Ratio of Ni/(Ni+X)]<br>
The concentrations of Nickel and X in the supported composite particle material<br>
were quantified using the Thermo Fisher Scientific Model IRIS Intrepid III XDL ICP<br>
Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, MS).<br>
Samples were prepared by weighing out a supported material into a Teflon<br>
decomposition vessel, adding nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride and heating and<br>
decomposing with the Milestone General Model ETHOS-TC Microwave<br>
Decomposition System, followed by evaporating to dryness over a heater, adding<br>
nitric acid and hydrochloric acid to the precipitated residue, heating under an applied<br>
pressure with a microwave decomposition system, and using a fixed amount of the<br>
resulting pure decomposition product as a test liquid.<br>
The quantification method was carried out by quantifying with ICP-AES with an<br>
internal standard and then determining the contents of nickel and X in the catalyst by<br>
subtracting a simultaneously determined blank value followed by calculating the<br>
loading and atomic ratio.<br>
[0144]<br>
[Determination of Contents of Support Constituent Elements (Si, Al,<br>
Basic Metal]<br>
Samples were prepared by dissolving the support with aqua regia and dissolving<br>
with molten alkali salt. The content of basic metal and/or Mg was measured for the<br><br>
sample dissolved with aqua regia and the contents of Al and Si were measured for the<br>
sample dissolved with molten alkali salt using the Seiko Instruments Model JY-38P2<br>
ICP Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES) followed by calculation of the atomic ratios<br>
from the resulting metal contents.<br>
[0145]<br>
[Analysis of Crystal Structure of Composite Particles]<br>
Crystal structure was analyzed using the Rigaku Model Rint 2500 Power X-Ray<br>
Diffraction System (XRD) under conditions of a Cu tube for the X-ray source (40 kV,<br>
200 mA), measuring range of 5 to 65 degrees (0.02 deg/step), measuring speed of<br>
0.2 deg/min and slit widths (scattering, divergence, reception) of 1 deg, 1 deg and<br>
0.15 mm.<br>
The sample was prepared by uniformly spraying onto a non-reflective sample<br>
plate and fixing with neoprene rubber.<br>
[0146]<br>
[Analysis of Chemical State of Composite Particle Metal Components]<br>
The chemical state of composite particle metal components was analyzed using<br>
the Thermo Electron Model ESCALAB 250 X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy<br>
System (XPS) under conditions of Al Ka at 15 kV x 10 mA for the excitation source,<br>
analyzed surface area of about 1 mm (shape: oval), using a 0 to 1,100 eV survey scan<br>
and an Ni2p narrow scan for the uptake region.<br>
The measurement samples were prepared by crushing the supported composite<br>
particle material with an agate mortar and pestle and placing on a special-purpose<br>
powder sample stage followed by XPS measurement.<br>
[0147]<br>
[Analysis of Chemical State of Nickel]<br>
Ni Ka spectra were measured with the Technos Model XFRA190<br>
High-Resolution X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy System (HRXRF), and each of<br><br>
the resulting parameters was compared with those of standard substances (nickel<br>
metal, nickel oxide) to predict the chemical state such as valence of nickel present in<br>
the supported material.<br>
The measurement samples were used directly for measurement. The Ka<br>
spectrum of Ni was measured in the partial spectral mode. At that time, Ge (220)<br>
was used for the analyzing crystal, a slit having a vertical divergence angle of 1<br>
degree was used for the slit, and the excitation voltage and current were set to 35 kV<br>
and 80 mA, respectively. Filter paper was then used for the absorber in the case of<br>
the reference sample, counting time was selected for each sample in the case of<br>
supported material samples, and measurements were carried out so that the peak<br>
intensity of the Ka spectra was 3,000 cps or less and 10,000 counts or more.<br>
Measurement was repeated five times for each sample, and metal samples were<br>
measured before and after each repeated measurement. After subjecting measured<br>
spectra to smoothing processing (S-G method, 7 points, 5 times), the peak locations,<br>
half-width values (FWHM) and asymmetry indices (Al) were calculated, and peak<br>
locations were treated as a chemical shift (AE) from the measured value of the metal<br>
sample measured before and after measurement of each sample.<br>
[0148]<br>
[Morphological Observation and Elementary Analysis of Composite Particles]<br>
TEM bright field images, STEM dark field images and STEM-EDS compositional<br>
analyses (point analyses, mapping, line analyses) were measured using the JEOL<br>
Model 3100FEF transmission electron microscope/scanning transmission electron<br>
microscope (TEM/STEM) (acceleration voltage: 300 kV, with energy dispersive X-ray<br>
detector (EDX)).<br>
The data analysis software contained Digital Micrograph™ Ver. 1.70.16 from<br>
Gatan for TEM image and STEM image analyses (length measurement, Fourier<br><br>
transform analysis), and the NORAN System SIX Ver. 2.0 from Thermo Fisher<br>
Scientific for EDS data analyses (mapping image processing, compositional<br>
quantification and calculation).<br>
The measurement samples were prepared by crushing the supported composite<br>
particle material with a mortar and pestle followed by dispersing in ethanol. After<br>
subjecting to ultrasonic cleaning for about 1 minute, the powder was dropped onto a<br>
molybdenum microgrid and air-dried to obtain TEM/STEM observation samples.<br>
[0149]<br>
[Measurement of Ultraviolet-Visible Spectra of Composite Particles]<br>
UV and visible spectra were measured using the Jasco Model V-550<br>
Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometer (UV-Vis) (with integrating sphere unit and<br>
powder sample holder) at a measuring range of 800 to 200 nm and scanning speed of<br>
400 nm/min.<br>
The measurement samples were prepared by crushing the supported composite<br>
particle material with an agate mortar and pestle and placing in the powder sample<br>
holder for measurement of UV-Vis spectra.<br>
[0150]<br>
[Measurement of Physical Properties of Support and Supported Composite<br>
Particle Material: Specific Surface Area, Pore Diameter, Pore Volume]<br>
Physical properties were measured with the Yuasa Ionics 3MP AutoSorb<br>
System using nitrogen gas for the adsorbing gas (nitrogen adsorption method). The<br>
BET method was used for specific surface area, the BJH method for pore diameter<br>
and pore distribution, and the amount of adsorption at maximum P/Po was used for<br>
pore volume.<br>
[0151]<br>
[Support Production Reference Example]<br>
An aqueous solution in which 3.75 kg of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, 2.56 kg<br><br>
of magnesium nitrate and 540 g of 60% nitric acid were dissolved in 5.0 L of pure<br>
water was gradually dropped into 20.0 kg of a silica sol solution having a colloidal<br>
particle diameter of 10 to 20 nm while stirring and holding at 15°C (Nissan Chemical<br>
Industries, Snowdex N-30, Si02 content: 30% by mass) to obtain a mixed slurry of<br>
silica sol, aluminum nitrate and magnesium nitrate. Subsequently, the mixed slurry<br>
was aged by holding at 50°C for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the<br>
mixed slurry was spray-dried with a spray dryer set to an outlet temperature of 130°C<br>
to obtain a solid.<br>
Next, the resulting solid was filled to a thickness of about 1 cm into a stainless<br>
steel container having an open top followed by heating an electric furnace from room<br>
temperature to 300°C over the course of 2 hours and holding at that temperature for 3<br>
hours. Moreover, after heating to 600°C over the course of 2 hours and holding at<br>
that temperature for 3 hours, the solid was cooled to obtain a support. The resulting<br>
support contained 83.3 mol%, 8.3 mol% and 8.3 mol% of silicon, aluminum and<br>
magnesium, respectively, based on the total molar amount of silicon, aluminum and<br>
magnesium. The specific surface area as determined by nitrogen adsorption was<br>
149 m2/g, the pore volume was 0.27 mL/g and the mean pore diameter was 8 nm.<br>
The mean particle diameter of the support was 60 µm based on the results of<br>
measurement of laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution. In addition, the<br>
form of the support was determined to be nearly spherical based on observations<br>
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).<br>
[0152]<br>
[Example 1]<br>
300 g of the support obtained in the Support Production Reference Example<br>
were dispersed in 1.0 L of water heated to 90°C followed by stirring for 15 minutes at<br>
90°C. Next, an aqueous solution containing 16.35 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate<br><br>
and 12 mL of a 1.3 mol/L aqueous solution of chloroauric acid was prepared followed<br>
by heating to 90°C, adding the above-mentioned support slurry and continuing to stir<br>
for 30 minutes at 90°C to insolubly fix the nickel and gold component on the support.<br>
Next, after removing the supernatant by allowing to stand undisturbed and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the washed supernatant was filtered.<br>
After drying for 10 hours at 105°C with a dryer, the product was fired for 5 hours at<br>
450°C in air in a muffle furnace to obtain a supported composite particle material<br>
(NiOAu/SiO2-AI2O3-MgO) supported with 1.05% by mass of nickel and 0.91 % by mass<br>
of gold. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Au) of the supported material thus obtained was<br>
0.80.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle<br>
cross-section using an X-ray microprobe (EPMA). The results are shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As can be clear from FIG. 1, the supported composite particle material had an outer<br>
layer substantially free of nickel and gold in a region at a depth of 0.5 µm from the<br>
outermost surface of the support, nickel and gold were supported in a region<br>
extending to a depth of 10 µm from the surface, and composite particles were<br>
confirmed not be present within the support.<br>
Next, when the form of the above-mentioned supported composite particle<br>
material was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM),<br>
spherical nanoparticles extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 2 to 3 nm<br>
(number average particle diameter: 3.0 nm) was confirmed to be supported on the<br>
support. Observation of the nanoparticles under higher magnification revealed<br>
lattice fringe corresponding to the interplanar spacing of Au (111) in the nanoparticles.<br>
Compositional point analysis of individual nanoparticles by STEM-EDS indicated that<br>
nickel and gold were detected in all of the particles. The mean value of the atomic<br><br>
ratio of nickel/gold of the nanoparticles (calculated quantity: 50) was 1.05. Moreover,<br>
analysis of the nanoregions of the observed particles revealed the Ni/Au atomic ratio<br>
in the central portions of the particles to be 0.90, while that on the edges of the<br>
particles was 2.56. Trace amounts of nickel only were detected in portions other<br>
than the particles. As a result of carrying out fifty similar measurements, nickel was<br>
detected in large amounts in the edges of all particles. The distribution of nickel and<br>
gold was observed to be nearly consistent based on the results of EDS elementary<br>
mapping. In addition, the magnitude of the distribution of nickel was found to be one<br>
level greater than that of the distribution of gold in all scanning direction based on the<br>
results of compositional line profiles.<br>
Based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), a diffraction pattern<br>
attributable to nickel was not observed, and nickel was confirmed to be present in an<br>
amorphous state. On the other hand, although not well-defined, a broad peak was<br>
present corresponding to gold crystals. Although the value is close to the detection<br>
limit of powder X-ray diffraction (2 nm), the mean crystallite diameter thereof was<br>
about 3 nm as calculated according to the Scherrer equation. With respect to the<br>
chemical state of nickel, nickel was confirmed to be bivalent based on the results of<br>
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
The chemical state of nickel was also predicted to be such that the nickel was in<br>
a high-spin state and have a valence of 2 based on the results of high-resolution X-ray<br>
fluorescence (HRXRF), and was determined to have a different chemical state than a<br>
single compound in the form of nickel oxide due to differences in the Ni Kα spectra.<br>
The half-width value (FWHM) of the Ni Ka spectrum of the resulting catalyst based on<br>
the measured spectrum was 3.470 and the chemical shift (AE) was 0.335. The<br>
half-width value (FHWM) of the Ni Kα spectrum of nickel oxide measured as a<br>
reference substance was 3.249 while the chemical shift (AE) was 0.344.<br><br>
In addition, as a result of investigating changes in electron excitation states of<br>
the supported composite particle material by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis),<br>
a surface plasmon absorption peak originating from gold nanoparticles did not appear<br>
in the vicinity of 530 nm, while broad absorption attributable to NiO2 was observed in<br>
the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm.<br>
On the basis of these results, the microstructure of the composite particles was<br>
predicted to have a form in which the surfaces of gold nanoparticles are covered by<br>
oxidized nickel.<br>
[0153]<br>
[Example 2]<br>
1.0 L of an aqueous solution in which was dissolved 2.90 g of magnesium<br>
chloride was heated to 80°C and stirred followed by the addition of 300 g of the<br>
support obtained in the Support Production Reference Example and further stirring for<br>
15 minutes at 80°C. Next, an aqueous solution containing 37.16 g of nickel nitrate<br>
hexahydrate and 35 mL of a 2.0 mol/L aqueous solution of palladium chloride was<br>
prepared followed by adding that heated to 80°C to the above-mentioned support<br>
slurry and continuing to stir for 30 minutes at 80°C to insolubly fix the nickel and<br>
palladium component on the support.<br>
Next, after removing the supernatant by allowing to stand undisturbed and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the washed supernatant was filtered.<br>
After drying for 10 hours at 105°C, the product was fired for 5 hours at 500°C in air.<br>
Next, the supported material thus obtained was subjected to reducing treatment at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours in a hydrogen atmosphere to obtain a supported<br>
composite particle material (NiOPd/α-alumina) supported with 2.48% by mass of<br>
nickel and 2.30% by mass of palladium. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Pd) of the<br>
supported material thus obtained was 0.66.<br><br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle<br>
cross-section using an X-ray microprobe (EPMA). The results are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
As can be clear from FIG. 2, nickel and palladium were confirmed to be supported in a<br>
region at a depth of 17 µm from the support surface while being absent inside.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the supported<br>
composite particle material, a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>
observed, and nickel was confirmed to be present in an amorphous state. On the<br>
other hand, although not well-defined, a broad peak was present corresponding to<br>
palladium crystals. The mean crystallite diameter thereof was about 5 nm as<br>
calculated according to the Scherrer equation. With respect to the chemical state of<br>
Ni, nickel was confirmed to be bivalent based on the results of X-ray photoelectron<br>
spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
In addition, when the state of active species of this supported material was<br>
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM), nanoparticles<br>
extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 4 to 5 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 4.8 nm) were confirmed to be supported on the support. Elementary<br>
analyses (20 points) were then carried out on individual observed nanoparticles with<br>

confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/palladium (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 0.8.<br>
[0154]<br>
[Example 3]<br>
1.0 L of an aqueous solution in which was dissolved 3.66 g of aluminum nitrate<br>
nonahydrate was heated to 80°C and stirred followed by the addition of 300 g of the<br>
support obtained in the Support Production Reference Example and further stirring for<br><br>
10 minutes at 80°C. Next, an aqueous solution containing 25.78 g of nickel nitrate<br>

slurry and continuing to stir for 15 minutes at 80°C to insolubly fix the nickel and gold<br>
component on the support.<br>
Next, after removing the supernatant by allowing to stand undisturbed and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the washed supernatant was filtered.<br>
After drying for 10 hours at 105°C, the product was fired for 5 hours at 400°C in an air<br>
to obtain a supported composite particle material (NiOAu/SiO2-Al2O3-MgO) supported<br>
with 2.20% by mass of nickel and 1.96% by mass of gold. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni<br>
+ Au) of the supported material thus obtained was 0.79.<br>

nickel and gold in a region extending to a depth of 2.0 µm from the outermost surface<br>
of the support, and nickel and gold were supported in a region extending to a depth of<br>
15 µm from the surface, while being absent inside.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the supported<br>
composite particle material, a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>
observed, and nickel was confirmed to be present in an amorphous state. On the<br>
other hand, although not well-defined, a broad peak was present corresponding to<br>
gold crystals. The mean crystallite diameter thereof was about 4 nm as calculated<br>
according to the Scherrer equation. With respect to the chemical state of Ni, nickel<br>
was confirmed to be bivalent based on the results of X-ray photoelectron<br>
spectroscopy (XPS).<br><br>
In addition, when the state of active species of this supported material was<br>
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM), nanoparticles<br>
extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 3 to 4 nm (number average particle<br>

analyses (20 points) were then carried out on individual observed nanoparticles with<br>
the energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) provided, and nickel and gold were<br>
confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/gold (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 1.10.<br>

[Example 4]<br>
A supported composite particle material (NiOAu/SiO2-AI2O3-MgO) supported<br>
with 1.02% by mass of nickel and 0.89% by mass of gold was obtained by preparing in<br>
the same manner as Example 1 with the exception of not aging the support and<br>
stirring the support slurry and aqueous solution containing nickel and gold for 15<br>
minutes at 60°C. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Au) of the supported material thus<br>
obtained was 0.79.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle<br>

the energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) provided, and nickel and gold were<br>
confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/gold (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 1.02.<br>

obtain a supported composite particle material (NiOAu/SiO2-La2O3) supported with<br>
1.10% by mass of nickel and 1.02% by mass of gold. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Au)<br>
of the supported material thus obtained was 0.78.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle<br>
cross-section using an X-ray microprobe (EPMA). As a result, the supported<br>
composite particle material was confirmed to have an outer layer substantially free of<br>
nickel and gold in a region extending to a depth of 5.0 µm from the outermost surface<br>
of the support, and nickel and gold were supported in a region extending to a depth of<br>
30 µm from the surface, while being absent inside.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the supported<br>
composite particle material, a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>

the mean crystallite diameter thereof was about 3 nm as calculated according to the<br>
Scherrer equation. With respect to the chemical state of Ni, nickel was confirmed to<br>
be bivalent based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
In addition, when the state of active species of this supported material was<br>
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM), nanoparticles<br>
extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 3.2 nm) were confirmed to be supported on the support. Elementary<br>
analyses (20 points) were then carried out on individual observed nanoparticles with<br>
the energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) provided, and nickel and gold were<br>
confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/gold (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 1.02.<br><br>
[0157]<br>
[Example 6]<br>
A commercially available spherical alumina (Sumitomo Chemical, KHD, particle<br>
diameter: 3 mm) was impregnated with 5% by mass of potassium followed by firing in<br>
air for 5 hours at 600°C. Next, 300 g of the resulting alumina support was dispersed<br>
in 1.0 L of water heated to 90°C and stirred for 15 minutes at 90°C. Next, an<br>
aqueous solution containing 38.65 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate and 30 ml_ of a 1.3<br>

that heated to 90°C to the support slurry and further continuing to stir for 30 minutes at<br>
90°C to insolubly fix the nickel and gold component on the support.<br>
Next, after removing the supernatant by allowing to stand undisturbed and<br>
washing several times with distilled water, the washed supernatant was filtered.<br>
After drying for 10 hours at 105°C, the product was fired for 5 hours at 400°C in air to<br>
obtain a supported composite particle material (NiOAu/Al2O3-K) supported with 2.50%<br>
by mass of nickel and 2.46% by mass of gold. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Au) of the<br>
supported material thus obtained was 0.77.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported composite particle<br>
material in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle<br>
cross-section using an X-ray microprobe (EPMA), and measurement of the<br>
distribution of nickel and gold was able to confirm that nickel and gold were supported<br>
in a region extending to 50 µm from the surface of the support, while being absent<br>
inside.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the supported<br>
composite particle material, a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>
observed, and nickel was confirmed to be present in an amorphous state. On the<br>
other hand, although not well-defined, a broad peak was present corresponding to<br><br>
gold crystals. The mean crystallite diameter thereof was about 4 nm as calculated<br>

confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/gold (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 0.94.<br>
[0158]<br>
[Comparative Example 1]<br>
1.0 L of an aqueous solution containing 16.35 g of nickel nitrate hexahydrate<br>
and 12 ml of a 1.3 mol/L aqueous solution of chloroauric acid was heated to 40°C. A<br>
supported composite particle material (NiOAu/SiO2-AI2O3-MgO) supported with 1.07%<br>
by mass of nickel and 0.90% by mass of gold was obtained by preparing using the<br>
same procedure as Example 1 with the exception of adding 300 g of the support<br>
obtained in the Support Production Reference Example to this aqueous solution,<br>
continuing to stir for 30 minutes while holding at 40°C and insolubly fixing the nickel<br>
and gold component on the support. The atomic ratio of Ni/(Ni + Au) of the<br>
supported material thus obtained was 0.80.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the supported material thus obtained in resin<br>
and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle cross-section using an<br>
X-ray microprobe (EPMA). The results are shown in FIG. 3. On the basis of FIG. 3,<br><br>
nickel and gold can be seen to be supported by being uniformly distributed from the<br>
surface to the interior.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the supported<br>
composite particle material, a diffraction pattern attributable to nickel was not<br>
observed, and nickel was confirmed to be present in an amorphous state. On the<br>
other hand, although not well-defined, a broad peak was present corresponding to<br>
gold crystals. Although close to the detection limit of powder X-ray diffraction (2 nm),<br>
the mean crystallite diameter thereof was about 3 nm as calculated according to the<br>
Scherrer equation. With respect to the chemical state of Ni, nickel was confirmed to<br>
be bivalent based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
In addition, when the state of active species of this supported material was<br>
observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM), nanoparticles<br>
extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 3.2 nm) were confirmed to be supported on the support. Elementary<br>
analyses (20 points) were then carried out on individual observed nanoparticles with<br>
the energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) provided, and nickel and gold were<br>
confirmed to be contained in all particles. The atomic ratio of nickel/gold (mean<br>
value) of these composite particles was 0.97.<br>
[0159]<br>
[Comparative Example 2]<br>
A supported gold particle material (Au/SiO2-AI2O3-MgO) supported with 0.90%<br>
by mass of gold was obtained by preparing a supported material using the same<br>
procedure as Example 1 with the exception of not adding nickel nitrate hexahydrate.<br>
A sample obtained by embedding the resulting supported gold particle material<br>
in resin and polishing was subjected to X-ray analysis of a particle cross-section using<br>
an X-ray microprobe (EPMA). The results are shown in FIG. 5. On the basis of FIG.<br><br>
1<br>
5, gold can be seen to be supported by being uniformly distributed from the surface to<br>
the interior.<br>
Next, based on the results of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), a broad peak was<br>
present corresponding to gold crystals. The mean crystallite diameter thereof was<br>
about 3 nm as calculated according to the Scherrer equation. When the state of the<br>
supported gold particle material was observed with a transmission electron<br>
microscope (TEM), gold particles having a mean particle diameter of 2.9 nm were<br>
confirmed to be supported on the support. In addition, as a result of investigating the<br>
electron excitation state of this supported gold particle material by ultraviolet-visible<br>
spectroscopy (UV-Vis), a surface plasmon absorption peak originating from gold<br>
particles was observed (at about 530 nm).<br>
Table 1 shows the physical properties of the supported composite particle<br>
material of Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2.<br>
[0160]<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br><br>
[Example 7]<br>
240 g of the supported composite particle material of Example 1 were charged<br>
into a stirred stainless steel reactor equipped with a catalyst separator and having a<br>
liquid phase portion of 1.2 liters, followed by carrying out a oxidative carboxylic acid<br>
ester formation reaction from aldehyde and alcohol while stirring the contents at a rate<br>
in terms of the stirrer tip speed of 4 m/s. A 36.7% by masst methacrolein/methanol<br>
solution at 0.6 liters/hr and a 1 to 4% by mass NaOH/methanol solution at 0.06<br>
liters/hr were continuously supplied to the reactor, air was blown in at a reaction<br>
temperature of 80°C and reaction pressure of 0.5 MPa so that the outlet oxygen<br>
concentration was 4.0% by volume (equivalent to oxygen partial pressure of 0.02<br>
MPa), and the concentration of NaOH supplied to the reactor was controlled so that a<br>
pH of the reaction system was 7. The reaction product was continuously extracted<br>
from the reactor outlet by overflow and reactivity was investigated by analyzing by gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
At 500 hours after the start of the reaction, the methacrolein conversion rate was<br>
75.4%, the selection rate of methyl methacrylate was 97.2%, and the formation<br>
activity of methyl methacrylate based on the supported material unit mass was 9.568<br>
mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 2000 hours had elapsed indicated a methacrolein<br>
conversion rate of 75.1%, methyl methacrylate selection rate of 97.1% and methyl<br>
methacrylate formation activity of 9.520 mol/h/kg-cat, thus showing hardly any change<br><br>
in reactivity. When the supported composite particle material was recovered and the<br>
loading of nickel and gold after 2000 hours were compared with the initial loading<br>
thereof, the nickel and gold losses were 0.1% or less, respectively, thus confirming<br>
that separation and elution of active components in the form of nickel and gold was<br>
inhibited.<br>
Next, when the recovered supported composite particle material was observed<br>
with a transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM), composite particles<br>
extensively distributed within a particle diameter of 2 to 3 nm (number average particle<br>
diameter: 3.2 nm) were confirmed to be supported on the support. Compositional<br>
point analysis of individual composite particles by STEM-EDS confirmed that nickel<br>
and gold were contained in all of the particles. The mean value of the atomic ratio of<br>
nickel/gold of the composite particles (calculated quantity: 50) was 1.10. In addition,<br>
as a result of investigating changes in electron excitation states of the supported<br>
material by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), a surface plasmon absorption<br>
peak originating from gold particles was not observed in the vicinity of 530 nm.<br>
[0162]<br>
[Comparative Example 3]<br>
A reaction was carried out under the same operating conditions as Example 1<br>
using the supported composite particle material of Comparative Example 1. As a<br>
result, at 500 hours after the start of the reaction, the methacrolein conversion rate<br>
was 63.4%, the selection rate of methyl methacrylate was 95.8%, and the formation<br>
activity of methyl methacrylate based on the supported material unit mass was 6.608<br>
mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 2000 hours had elapsed indicated a methacrolein<br>
conversion rate of 58.7%, methyl methacrylate selection rate of 95.7% and methyl<br>
methacrylate formation activity of 6.111 mol/h/kg-cat, thus showing decreases in<br>
reaction activity and selectivity. When the supported composite particle material was<br><br>
recovered and the loading of nickel and gold after 2000 hours were compared with the<br>
initial loading thereof, the nickel and gold losses were 3.0% and 2.0%, respectively.<br>
The number average particle diameter of the composite particles as determined with a<br>
transmission electron microscope (TEM) was 3.8 nm, and sintering of composite<br>
particles was observed.<br>
[0163]<br>
[Comparative Example 4]<br>
A reaction was carried out under the same operating conditions as Example 1<br>
using the supported composite particle material of Comparative Example 2. As a<br>
result, at 200 hours after the start of the reaction, the methacrolein conversion rate<br>
was 25.1%, the selection rate of methyl methacrylate was 81.5%, and the formation<br>
activity of methyl methacrylate based on the supported material unit mass was 2.671<br>
mol/h/kg-cat. Reactivity after 700 hours had elapsed indicated a methacrolein<br>
conversion rate of 18.3%, methyl methacrylate selection rate of 79.1% and methyl<br>
methacrylate formation activity of 1.89 mol/h/kg-cat, thus showing decreases in<br>
reaction activity and selectivity. When the supported composite particle material was<br>
recovered and the loading of gold after 700 hours were compared with the initial<br>
loading thereof, the gold loss was 8.5%. The number average particle diameter of<br>
gold particles as determined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) was 4.8<br>
nm, and sintering of gold particles was observed.<br>
[0164]<br>
On the basis of the above results, the supported composite particle material of<br>
the present embodiment was confirmed to maintain an extremely high level of<br>
reactivity for a long period of time and the structure of the composite particles thereof<br>
were confirmed to not change before and after the reaction in the case of using as a<br>
catalyst of a carboxylic acid ester formation reaction as previously described.<br><br>
Moreover, as a result of being provided with an outer layer substantially free of the<br>
composite particles, a supported composite particle material is obtained in which<br>
nickel and gold component loss caused by friction and the like can be inhibited. As<br>
observed in the previously described reaction examples, when composite particles<br>
are supported near the surface of the support, reaction activity increases and metal<br>
component loss decreases. Thus, in comparison with conventional supported<br>
materials, considerable improvement in economy can be obtained not only in this<br>
specific reaction, but also in general in a wider range of numerous other reactions.<br>
