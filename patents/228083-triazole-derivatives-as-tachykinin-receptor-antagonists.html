				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compounds of Formula (I), compositions thereof,<br>
and a method of antagonizing the NK-1 subtype of tachykinin feceptor that comprises<br>
administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula<br>
(I). In addition, the present invention relates to processes for preparing the compounds of<br>
Formula 1 and intermediates thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Techykinins are a femily of neotides that are widely distributed in both the central<br>
and peripheral nervous systems. These peptides exert a number of biological effects<br>
throuch actions at tachykinin receptors. To date, three such receptors have been<br>
characterized, including the NK-1, NK-2, and NK-3 subtypes of tachykinin receptor.<br>
The role of the NK-1 receptor subtype in numerous disorders of the central<br>
nervous system and the periphery has been thoroughly demonstrated in the art. For<br>
instance, NK-3 receptors arc believed to play a role in depression, anxiety, and central<br>
regulation of various autonomic, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory functions, NK-<br>
1 receptors in the spinal cord are believed to play a role in pain transmission, especially<br>
the pain associated with migraine and arthritis. In the periphery, NK-1 receptor activation<br>
has been implicated in numerous disorders, including various inflammatory disorders,<br>
asthma, and disorders of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract.<br>
There are a actrictive which recognion; that selectiv NK) receptor antagonists.<br>
would prove useful in the treatmem of many diseases of the central nervous system and<br>
the periphery. While many of these disorders are being treated by new medicines, there<br>
are still many shortcomings associated with existing treatments. For example, the newest<br>
class of anti-depressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are increasingly<br>
prescribed for the treatment of depression; however, SSRIs have numerous side effects,<br>
including nausea, insomnia, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction. This could significantly<br>
affect patient compliance rate. As another example, current treatments for chemotherapy-<br>
induced nausea and emesis, such as the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, are ineffective in<br><br>
managing delayed cmests. The development of NK-1 receptor antagonists will therefore<br>
greatly enhance the ability to treat such disorders more effectively. Thus, the present<br>
invention provides a class of potent, non-peptidc NK-1 receptor antagonists, compositions<br>
comprising these compounds, and methods of using the compounds.<br>

The skilled arnsav. will appreate that additional promesed emboudiment may be<br>
selected by combining the preferred embodiments above, or by reference to the examples<br>

Schemes<br>
The compounds disclosed herein can be made according to the following schemes<br>
and examples. The examples should in no way be understood to be limiting in any way as<br>
to how the compounds may be made.<br><br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that the introduction of certain substituents will create<br>
asymmetry in the compounds of Formula (I). The present invention contemplates all<br>
enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, including racemates. It is preferred that the<br>
compounds of the invention containing chiral centers are single enantiomers.<br>
The compounds: of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of<br>
procedures, some of which are illustrated in the Schemes below. It will be recognized by<br>
one of skill in the art that the individual steps in the following schemes may be varied to<br>
provide the compounds of Formula (I). The particular order of steps required to produce<br>
the compounds of Formula (I) is dependent upon the particular compound being<br>
synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties.<br><br>
In Scheme 1. the triazole compounds of Formula (3) are formed by reacting a beta,<br>
keto estei of Formula (2), such as a beta keto C1-C6 alkyl or benzyl ester, with an azide of<br>
Formula (1). Such ring formations are well known and appreciated in the art. See Savini<br>
et al., Farmaco (1994) 49(5): 363-370; Martini et al., J. Phann. Sci. (198S) 77(11): 977-<br>

al., J. Heterocycl. Chem. (1991) 28(2): 301-304. The product of Formula (3) can be<br>
isolated and purified by techniques well known in the art, such as precipitation, filtration,,<br>
extraction, evaporation, trituration, chromatography, and recrystallization.<br>
Azides of Formula (1) are commercially available or can be synthesized from the<br>
corresponding halide or sulfonate ester derivatives by reaction with an azide source, such<br>
as NaN3, LiN3, or tetrabutyl ammonium azide (BU4NN3), with NaN3 being preferred in a<br>
suitable solvent mixture as DMSO and water.<br>
Alternatively, the skilled artisan would also appreciate that a malonate derivative<br>
maybe used in the reaction of step a, instead of a beta keto ester. Both the malonates and<br>
the beta keto esters are well known and appreciated in the art. See Benetti, S.; Romagnoli,<br>
R.; De Risi, C; Zanirato, Z "Mastering (3-Keto Esters," Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 1065-1114.<br>
When dialkylmalonates are chosen as the starting reagent, R5 in the resulting<br>
product of Formula (3) is a hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl 'group may be readily<br>
converted to the corresponding halide intermediate. This type of transformation is well<br>
known and appreciated in the art. See Buckle, D. R.; Rockell, C. J. M. J. Chem. Soc,<br>
Perkin I, 1982, 627-630.<br>
Step b depicts the reduction of lH-[1,2,3]triazole-4-carboxylic acid ester of<br>
Formula (3) to give a lH-[1,2,3]triazol-4-yl-methanol of Formula (4). Such reduction<br>
steps are well known and appreciated in the art. See Larock, R. C, Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations, 2nd Ed., copyright 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp 1117-1120.<br>
In one variation of step b, the 1H-[1,2,3]triazole-4-carboxylic acid ester of<br>
Formula (3) may be reduced by a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride,<br>
lithium aluminumhydride, lithium borohydride, or diisobutyl aluminumhydride, with<br>
sodium borohydride being the preferred reducing agent. Such reductions are generally<br>
camed out m a solvent such as MeOH, LtOh. iPrOH THI . toluene, methylend chlonde.<br>
or mixtures thereof. The preferred solvent is absolute ethanol. The product can be<br>
isolated and purified by techniques described above.<br>
Oxidation of an alkyl-hydroxy group of Formula (4) is well known in the art. A<br>
representative example is shown in step c, in which the lH-[1,2,3]triazol-4-yl-methanol of<br>
Formula (4) can be oxidized by reacting it with an appropriate oxidizing agent, such as<br>
manganese oxide. Other oxidizing agents include pyridine sulfurtrioxide complex, 1,1.1-<br>
triacetoxy-l,l-dihydro-l,2-benziodoxol-3(lH)-one (Dess-Martin reagent), pyridinium<br><br>
chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, and catalytic tetrapropylarrunonium perruthenate<br>
(TPAP) with N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) as a co-oxidant. The aldehydes of<br>
Formula (5) can be isolated by techniques described above.<br>
Hydrolysis of the carboxyl esters of Formula (3) to give the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acids of Formula (6) is well known reaction. See Larock, R. C,<br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 2nd Ed., copyright 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
pp 1959-1968. For example, an appropriate ester of Formula (3) is dissolved in a suitable<br>
solvent, such as methanol or dioxane and water, and treated with a suitable base, such as<br>
NaOH or LiOH, to give a compound of Formula (6).<br>
The reaction of step e, in which a carboxylic acid, such as that of Formula (6), is<br>
coupled with an appropriate amine, under standard peptide coupling conditions, is well<br>
known to the skilled artisan. Specifically, the amine and the carboxylic acid are coupled<br>
in the presence of a peptide coupling reagent, optionally in the presence of a catalyst. .<br>
Suitable peptide coupling reagents include N,N'-carbonyldiiraidazo]e (CDI), N,N'-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride (EDC), and 1-(3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (PEPC).<br>
Suitable catalysts for the coupling reaction include N,N-[dimethyl3-4-aminopyridine<br>
(DMAP). Such coupling reactions are well known and appreciated in the art. See Larock,<br>
R. C, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 2nd Ed., copyright 1999, John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, pp 1941-1949.<br>
Alternatively, a compound of Formula (6) may be converted to an acid chloride<br>
derivative, preferably by reaction with oxalyl chloride and DMF, and used to acylate the<br>
appropriate amine to give a compound of Formula (7). Such acylation reactions are well<br>
known and appered in the art SEC Lamond R Comprehemer Organ<br>
Transformations, 2nd Ed., copyright 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp 1929-1930. The<br>
product can be isolated and purified by techniques described above.<br>
One skilled in the art could also appreciate the formation of the amides of Formula<br>
(7) by a direct conversion of the carboxyl ester of Formula (3) by the use of a trialkyl-<br>
aluminum reagent with an appropriate amine or by use of a magnesium amide to afford<br>
compounds of Formula (7). Formula (7) can further undergo a reduction, step g, by<br>
treatment of a suitable reducing agent, such as diisobutylaluminiun hydride, lithium<br>
aluminum hydride or a borane-methyl sulfide complex to afford aldehydes of Formula (5).<br><br><br>
The alkynyl-ketones of Formula (9) can be synthesized from the aldehydes of<br>
Formula (5) (see Scheme 1) or the N-methyl-N-methoxyamide derivatives of Formula<br>
(10).<br>
Step h depicts the addition of an alkynyl anion to an aldehyde of Formula (5) or a<br>
N-methyl-N-methoxyamide of Formula (9). The alkynyl anion is generated by treating the<br>
appropriate alkyne with a suitable base, such as methyl lithium, n-butyl lithium, tert-buty]<br>
lithium, lithium diisopropylamine, preferably methyl or ethyl magnesium bromide. Wher<br>
the aldehydes of Formula (5) are used, the hydroxy intermediate, Formula (8), can be<br>
oxidized to afford the ketone of Formula (9). Such reactions are well known in the art.<br>
See Larock, R.C., Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 2nd ed, Wiley-VCH: New<br>
York, 1999, pp 1234-1246. Alternatively, when the N-methyl-N-methoxyamide<br>
derivatives of Formula (10) are used compounds of Formula (9) are obtained directly.<br><br><br>
Stannaries of Formula (13) can be made from the reaction of an appropriate azide,<br>
Formula (1), with an appropriate starmyl-acetylene of Formula (12). The reactants are<br>
combined in a suitable solvent, such as benzene, chloroform, THF, preferably toluene,<br>
and heated until the reaction is complete. The compound of Formula (13) is isolated and<br>
purified by techniques known in the art and described above.<br>
The stannyl-acetylenes of Formula (12) are readily available from commercial<br>
sources or can be prepared from compounds of Formula (11) or (14). A compound of<br>
Formula (11) may be dissolved in an appropriate solvent, such as THF, followed by<br>
addition of bis(tributyl)tin oxide and an appropriate desilylating agent, such as TBAF<br>
(tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride), or potassium trimethylsilanolate. Alternatively, the<br>
compound of Formula (1.2) is made by dissolving an alkyne in an appropriate solvent,<br>
such as ether or THF, at -15 to -10 °C. To this mixture is added nBuLi, followed by<br>
tributyltin chloride. The compound of Formula (12) may be used directly or isolated and<br>
purified by techniques described above<br>
The formation of various stannyl acetylenes of Formula (12) has been described<br>
elsewhere. For example, see WO 00/51614; WO 00/01702; WO 9S/46228; Lambert et<br>
al., Journal of the Chemical Society, Perkin Transactions 2 (2001) 6: 964-974;<br>
Yamamoto et al., J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans.1 (1991) 12: 3253-7; Zhou et al., J. Chem.<br>
Soc, Perkin Trans. J (1991) 11: 2827-30; Warner et al., J. Org. Chem. (1994), 59(19):<br>
5822-23; and Jacobi et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society (2000), 122(18):<br>
4295-4303.<br><br>
The silyl-acetylenes of Formula (11) are readily available from commercial<br>
sources. Alternatively, the skilled artisan will recognize that compounds of Formula (11)<br>
may be prepared by reacting an appropriate aryl halide compound with trimethylsilyl<br>
acetylene to give the silyl-alkyne. The reaction proceeds in the presence of copper iodide<br>
and a palladium catalyst, such as dichlorobis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium (U)- Other<br>
suitable catalysts include Pd(Ph3)4, Pd2dba3.CHCl3, or Pd(OAc)2.<br><br>
To make the compound of Formula (17), where L can be a halide, trimethylsilyl<br>
(TMS) or trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate), preferably a bromide, a heteroaryl of<br>
Formula (18) is heated with a suitable base, such as LDA (lithium diisopropyl amide) or<br>
LiTMP (lithium tetramethylpiperidine), in a suitable solvent, such as ether, or preferably<br>
THF, and then reacted with a commercially available aldehyde, step n, to give the<br>
substituted heteroaryl of Formula (17). in which X is -CH(OH). Compounds of Formula<br>
(17) can bt isolated anc punfled by lechniques descnbec above.<br>
Alternatively, for compounds of Formula (17) in which A2 and A4 are both<br>
nitrogen, the 5-bromopyrimidine of Formula (18) and a commercially available aldehyde<br>
are dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as ether, and heated to reflux. A suitable base<br>
such as LDA is added to afford the compound of Formula (17), which may be isolated<br>
and purified by techniques described above. See reference: Kress, T. J., J. Org. Chew.,<br>
1979, 44(13), 2081-2082. One skilled in the art would appreciate the use of an<br><br>
appropriate substituted disulfide compound, of the form R6-X-X-R6, instead of an<br>
aldehyde, to also afford compounds of Formula (17), where X is a sulfur.<br>
Compounds of Formula (17) in which X is -CH(OH)- can be oxidized by<br>
techniques well known in the art to give a ketone of Formula (17), in which X is -C(O)-.<br>
For instance, the alcohol may be dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as toluene or<br>
CH2Cl2, followed by addition of MnO2- The ketone can be isolated and purified by<br>
techniques that are well known in the art. It will be generally recognized that other<br>
oxidizing conditions can be used to give the compound of Formula (17), in which X is -<br>
C(O)-. For example, oxidation can be achieved by use of Dess-Martin periodinane.<br>
Other oxidizing conditions are well known in the art. See Larock, R.C.,Comprehensive<br>
Organic Transformations, 2nd ed, Wiley-VCH: New York, 1999, pp 1234-1246.<br>
As shown in step m, ketones of Formula (17) in which A1 and A2 are both<br>
nitrogen can alternatively be made by reacting the dihydropyridazinone of Formula (15)<br>
with the appropriate aldehyde of Formula (19) in the presence of a suitable base, such as<br>
NaOH, or KOH, in a suitable solvent, such as MeOH or EtOH. The preferred<br>
combination is KOH in EtOH. The compound of Formula (16), in which X is methylene,<br>
is isolated and purified by techniques well known in the art and described above. The<br>
methylene can be further oxidized to give a compound of Formula (16) in which X is -<br>
C(O)- by treating with a solution of acetic acid and sodium dichromate and heating. The<br>

Allcylations of this type are well known in the literature. An appropriate solvent for such<br>
reactions is dirnethylforrnamide. A suitable non-nucleophilic base may include potassium<br>
carbonate. Sodium iodide is added in a catalytic amount.<br>
Compounds of Formula (62) are conveniently prepared by the reaction of the,<br>
esters of Formula (3) and commercially available diamines in the presence of<br>
trimethylaluminum. Products can be purified by techniques previously described.<br><br>
Route 3 depicts the formation of compounds of Formula (63) by the read ion of an<br>
appropriate amino-anucie of formula (64) m the presence of phosphorus pemachlond in<br>
a suitable solvent such as chloroform at reflux, step xx. Compounds of Formula (63) can<br>
be purified by techniques described previously. One skilled in the art would recognize<br>
compounds of Formula (64) can be prepared by transformation of compounds of Formula<br>
(43) of Scheme 12.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that imidazolines of Formula (63) (in<br>
which Rx is a bond) maybe further aromatized to give compounds of Formula (63) in<br>
which R4 is a radical of Formula (IC) and -G4-G5-G6- is -N-CR8-CR8-, which are<br><br>
encompassed in Formula (I). The dehydrogenation conditions include dissolving the<br>
imidazoline in a solvent such as xylenes and adding a palladium catalyst such a 10%<br>
palladium on carbon. The dehydrogenation reaction is allowed to heat until the reaction is<br>
complete. A reference for the dehydrogenation conditions is Amemiya, Y.; Miller, D.D.;<br>
Hsu, F.L.; Synth. Comm. 1990, Vol 20 (16) 2483-2489. The pioduct of the reaction can<br>
be isolated and purified using techniques well know in the art. These techniques include<br>

NK-1 Receptor Binding Assay<br>
The IM cell line is a well-characterized and readilv available human cell line<br>
See, e.g.. Annak oi the New York Acadeny of Science. 190. 224, -234 (1972); Nanire<br>
(London), 251:443-444 (1974); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA),<br>
71:84-88 (1974). These cells are routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 50<br>
Hg/ml gentamicin sulfate and 10% fetal calf serum.<br>
The IM-9 cells are homogenized from cell pellets for crude membranes. The<br>
membranes are isolated by homogenizing tissue samples in 30 ml w/v with 50 mM Tris<br>
buffer (pH 7.4). After an initial spin at 900 x g, the supernatant is transferred to a clean<br>
centrifuge tube and the membranes isolated by centrifugation at 3S,000 x g.<br><br>
Approximately 25 µg of membranes are incubated with 0.2nM [125I]-substance P<br>
(NEN, Boston, MA) in a receptor binding assay. The assay buffer contains 50 mM Tris,'3<br>
mM MnCl2, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 40 ug/ml bacitracin, 2 ug/ml chymostatin, 4<br>
ug/ml leupeptin and 40 µg/ml thiorphan (pH 7.4). Binding studies are conducted in a<br>
final volume of 200 µl containing various concentrations of test compounds. Non-<br>
specific binding is determined by incubating some rubes in the presence of 1 uM<br>
substance P (Peninsula, Belmont, CA).<br>
Binding is terminated 1 hour later by rapid filtration using a TOMTEC 96-well<br>
cell harvester (TOMTEC, Orange, CT) through GF/A filters that have been presoaked<br>
with 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Sigma, St Louis) for 1 hour. The filters are washed with 5<br>
ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and placed in a drying oven at 60°C. The dried<br>
filters are treated with MeltiLex A melt-on scintillator sheets (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD),<br>
and the radioactivity retained on the filters counted using the Wallac 1205 Betaplate<br>
scintillation counter. The results are analyzed using a Log-Logit plot from a Microsoft<br>
Excel workbook and converted to Ki values with the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Protein<br>
concentrations are measured using Coomassie® protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford,<br>
IL), with BSA for standards (Bradford, 1976).<br>
Binding studies are carried out to evaluate the ability of compounds of the present<br>
invention to inhibit NK-1 receptor activation. Such studies provide in vitro data regarding<br>
the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention. Compounds described herein as<br>
EXAMPLES have been demonstrated to have binding affinities (Kj values) of 
The results of NK-1 receptor binding studies demonstrate the ability of<br>
compounds of the present invention to act as antagonists of NK-1 receptors. It is<br>
recognzed that the conpounds of the presents cannan would be expected inhibit the<br>
effects of NK-1 receptor activation. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are<br>
expected to be useful in the treatment of various disorders associated with excess<br>
tachykinins, as described to be treated herein, and other disorders that can be treated by<br>
such antagonists, as are appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides methods of treating disorders<br>

a compound of formula or a phanmacai. composmon there. that is the present<br>
invention provides methods of treating disorders associated with an excess of tachykinins,<br>
comprising: administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound<br>
of Formula I or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
The present invention contemplates the various disorders described to be treated<br>
herein and others that can be treated by such antagonists, as appreciated by those skilled<br>
in the art.<br><br>
The disorders associated with an excess of tachykinins are treated by<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound or phannaceutical composition o<br>
Formula I. An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician,<br>
as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results<br>
obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining an effective amount, the dose-of<br>
a compound of Formula I, a number of factors are considered by the attending<br>
diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the compound of Formula I to be<br>
administered; the species of mammal - its size, age, and general health; the specific<br>
disorder involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disorder; the response<br>
of the individual patient; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of<br>
the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of other concomitant<br>
medication; and other relevant circumstances.<br>
An effective amount of a compound of Formula I is expected to vary from about<br>
0.001 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100<br>
mg/kg/day. Preferred amounts may be readily determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
Of the disorders associated with an excess of tachykinins that are treated according<br>
to the present invention, the treatment of depression and anxiety are particularly preferred.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
treating a depressive disorder, including major depressive disorder, comprising:<br>
administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula I<br>
or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
According to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br>
Disorders (DSM-IV™) (1994, American Psychiatric Association. Washington. D.C.),<br>
major depress disorders an. charnil one of more<br>
Thus, the skilled artisan will recognize that the present invention is useful for the<br>
treatment of a single episode and recurrent episodes of major depressive disorder.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
treating anxiety, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-<br>
compulsive disorder, comprising: administering to a patient in need thereof an effective<br>
amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
At present, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br>
Disorders (DSM-IV™) (1994, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C.),<br><br>
provides a diagnostic tool for anxiety and related disorders. These disorders include:<br>
panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic<br>
disorder, specific phobia, social phobia or social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive<br>
disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety<br>
disorder, anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, substance-induced anxiety<br>
disorder and anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. As used herein, the term "anxiety"<br>
includes treatment of those anxiety disorders and related disorder as described in the<br>
DSM-FV. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures,<br>
nosologies, and classification systems for neurological and psychiatric disorders,<br>
particularly anxiety, and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress. Thus,<br>
the term "anxiety" is intended to include like disorders that are described in other<br>
diagnostic sources.<br>
Several preclinical laboratory animal models have been described for a number of<br>
the disorders associated with an excess of tachykinins. One such in vivo assay, described<br>
below, may be used to determine whether NK-1 receptor antagonists are CNS-penetrant.<br>

The stock solution is further diluted to 10 µg/ml in saline (0.9% normal saline), aliquoted<br>
and kept frozen until use. The stock solution is further diluted to 3 pmol/5 pi in saline for<br>
i.c.v. injections.<br>
Test compounds are formulated in appropriate vehicle to a concentration of 1<br>
ml/100 gm body weight. Compounds are dosed by oral eavage (p.o.) or subcutaneously<br>
(s.c.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) at pre-determined times prior to intracerebroventricular<br><br>
(i.c.v.) challenge of agonist. For i.e.v. administration, test compound is co-injected with<br>
agonist.<br>
Free hand i.c.v. injection is performed by direct vertical insertion of a cuffed 27-<br>
gauge needle with a Hamilton 50 µl syringe, to a depth of 4.5 mm below bregma. Light<br>
anesthesia with isoflurane may be needed prior to the injection, but is not used routinely.<br>
Following i.c.v. injection of agonist, animals are placed in a plexiglas observation<br>
box, and hind foot tapping events are counted for 5 minutes. Data collection is<br>
computerized.<br>
Data are analyzed by AMOVA followed by Dunnett's test using JMP statistical<br>
program (IBM platform). Data are expressed as number of events/5 minutes.<br><br><br>
