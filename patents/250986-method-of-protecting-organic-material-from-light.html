				<td>Method of protecting organic material from light<br>
The present invention relates to a method of protecting organic material from damage that daylight ("visible light"), and especially an artificial light, may cause.<br>
Organic material, for example pharmaceuticals or, especially, organic material from the food and nutrition sector, for example vegetables, fruit, meat, contains organic substances that are sensitive to light irradiation, especially in the short-wave range of daylight (up to 500 nm) and in the UV range.<br>
The spectra of daylight and artificial light are different. For example, in the spectrum of a neon tube the proportion of UV from 250 to 400 nm is smaller compared with daylight, but the proportion of light having an extinction from 400 to 500 nm, with a maximum at about 480 nm (blue region), is significantly greater than in the case of daylight.<br>
Many foodstuffs, for example fruit, meat, milk, beer, mushrooms, contain vitamin B2, which is known to be very sensitive to UV light as well as to daylight up to 500 nm. Vitamin B2, also known by the name riboflavin, is present in high concentrations especially in eggs, milk, liver, cheese and fish.<br><br>
The light sensitivity of riboflavin is also one of the reasons why, for example, milk is mainly stored and sold in tetrapacks that are impermeable to light or in white-coloured bottles.<br>
The use of UV absorbers for protection from light is known perse in the food industry. It has been shown, however, that commercially available UV absorbers are active only in the<br>
spectral range of approximately from 300 to 400 nm but not in the likewise critical spectral range of from 400 to 500 nm.<br>
There is accordingly still a need for better protection of organic material from the damaging action of light over the entire critical spectral range.<br>
It has now, surprisingly, been found that the method according to the invention substantially meets the above-mentioned criterion.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a method of protecting organic material, espe¬cially from the food and nutrition sector, from light, which method comprises applying to or incorporating in a carrier material a combination of the dye of formula <br>
and, optionally, further dyes,<br>
and positioning the so-treated carrier material between the light source and the organic ma¬terial to be protected.<br>
In addition to the dyes of formulae (1) and (2), other dyes may also be present in the combi¬nation according to the invention.<br>
Preference is given to a combination of the dyes of formulae (1) and (2) and the dye of for¬mula<br><br>
and a UV absorber.<br>
The amounts in which the combination being used is admixed with the carrier material or applied to the carrier material can vary within wide limits; amounts of from 0.001 to 5 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, more especially from 0.03 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the carrier material, have generally proved advantageous.<br>

CrCi2Alkyl and CrCealkyl as R2 or R3 may be linear or may be branched from C3 upwards.<br>
The combination used in accordance with the invention especially comprises one or more UV absorbers of the formulae <br>
The amount of the UV absorber may vary within wide limits; advantageously from 0.01 to 1.0 % by weight, especially from 0.02 to 0.6 % by weight, and more especially from 0.05 to 0.4 % by weight of a UV absorber, based on the weight of the carrier material, is used.<br>
The compounds of formulae (1) to (11) are known and can be prepared in a manner known perse according to known methods.<br>
The carrier material suitable for the method according to the invention generally consists of glass or of transparent plastics films or plastics sheets produced from high molecular weight organic material.<br>
Suitable high molecular weight organic materials for the production of the plastics films or sheets are, very generally, polymers, such as especially polyesters (PES, PET), polycarbo¬nate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, ethyl-butyl acrylate (EBA), polyvinyl butyrate (PVB), styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS).<br>
Especially preferred are polyesters, polymethyl methacrylate and polyamide. More especially preferred are linear aromatic polyesters obtainable by polycondensation of terephthalic acid and glycols, especially ethylene glycol, or condensation products of terephthalic acid and 1,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane, for example polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethy¬lene napthalate (PEN) or polybutylene terephthalate (PBTP); also polycarbonates, for example those obtained from a,a-dimethyl-4,4-dihydroxy-diphenylmethane and phosgene, or<br>
polymers based on polyvinyl chloride and on polyamide, for example polyamide 6 or polyami- de 6.6.<br>
The method according to the invention is carried out, for example, by admixing the dyes of formulae (1) and (2) and, optionally, (3), and a UV absorber, using extruders, roll mills or mi¬xing or grinding apparatuses, with the plastics or polymeric colour particles used to produce the plastics films or sheets, with the result that the dyes and the UV absorber are dissolved or finely distributed in the high molecular weight material. The addition of the dye compo¬nents of the combination used according to the invention and of a UV absorber may take pla¬ce simultaneously or in succession, the order in which they are added being chosen as desi¬red.<br>
The plastics or polymeric colour particles treated in that manner are then processed accor¬ding to methods known perse to form a film or a sheet or to form mouldings, such as contai¬ners for solid or liquid substances, for example containers and bottles for drinks, or for phar¬maceutical preparations, for example pills or drops.<br>
Admixture of the dyes and of the UV absorber can also be effected immediately prior to the actual processing step, for example by continuously simultaneously feeding the dye compo¬nents of the combination used according to the invention, a pulverulent UV absorber and a granulated or pulverulent high molecular weight organic material and, optionally, also additio¬nal ingredients, such as additives, directly into the intake zone of an extruder, the consti¬tuents being mixed just prior to processing. Generally, however, preference is given to mixing the combination used according to the invention into the high molecular weight organic mate¬rial beforehand.<br>
It is often desirable, in order to reduce brittleness, to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high molecular weight compounds prior to the film production. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. In the method according to the invention, the plasticisers may be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the combination used according to the invention. It is also possible, in order to achieve different shades of colour, to add to the high molecular weight organic materials, in addition to the dyes of formulae (1) and (2) and, optionally, (3) also furt¬her dyes or other colorants in any desired amounts, optionally together with further additives, e.g. fillers or siccatives.<br>
A further embodiment of the method according to the invention comprises treating glass or previously produced transparent plastics film by, for example, spraying on or applying the combination used according to the invention, or spraying on or applying the dye components of the combination used according to the invention and a UV absorber independently of one another, the spraying or application being carried out in any order.<br>
The above-mentioned materials treated by the method according to the invention, especially those made of polyesters, are distinguished by very good in-use fastness properties, such as especially good fastness to light and to hot light.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of a combination of the dyes of formulae (1) and (2) and, optionally, (3), and a UV absorber in the protection of organic materials against light.<br>
Various methods can be used for introducing the carrier material treated with the combina¬tion according to the invention between the light source and the organic material to be pro¬tected.<br>
The organic material to be protected may, for example, be encapsulated by a plastics film treated with the combination according to the invention. The film produced according to the invention can also be used, for example, for covering a greenhouse. A further possibility comprises applying the combination according to the invention directly, for example, to glass windows, glass bottles, containers or packaging for pharmaceutical pro¬ducts and preparations, to plastics windows or to cupboard doors made from glass or plas¬tics, or providing the glass or plastics windows or the cupboard doors made from glass or plastics with a plastics film treated with the combination according to the invention. In addition, a direct light source, for example a neon tube, can be provided with a finish by application of the combination according to the invention thereto or by adhesion of a plastics film treated with the combination according to the invention.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, parts are parts by weight and percentages are percentages by weight. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. The relationship between parts by weight and parts by volume is the same as that between grams and cubic centimetres.<br>
