				<td>AN INDICATOR MACROMOLECULE FOR DETECTION OF ANALYTES IN AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENrS AND METHOD FOR ITS PRODUCTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1.  Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to indicator molecules for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte in a medium, such as a liquid, and to methods for achieving such detection.  More particularly, the invention relates to copolymer macromolecules containing relatively hydrophobic indicator component monomers,, and hydrophilic monomers, such that the macromolecule is capable of use in an aqueous environment.<br>
2 -  Description of the Related Art .<br>
Indicator molecules for detecting the presence or concentration of an analyte in a medium are known. Unfortunately, many of such indicators are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water.  For example, U.S. Patent 5,503,770 (James, et al.) describes a fluorescent boronic acid-containing compound that emits fluorescence of a high intensity upon binding to saccharid.es, including glucose.  The fluorescent compound has a molecular structure comprising a fluorophore, at least one phenylboronic acid moiety- and at least one amine-<br>
—1-<br><br>
providing nitrogen atom where the nitrogen atom is disposed in the vicinity of the phenylboronic acid moiety so as to interact intramolecularly with the boronic acid. Such interaction thereby causes the compound to emit fluorescence upon saccharide binding.  See also.T. James, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117(35):8982-87 (1995). However, the compound described in example 2 of U.S. Patent 5,503,770 (having formula (6)) is substantially insoluble in water, and as a practical matter requires the presence of an organic solvent such as methanol in order to work in a liquid environment.<br>
Lack of sufficient aqueous solubility is a severe problem when dealing with applications in an aqueous environment, for example, in vivo applications.  Thus, there remains a great need for adapting insoluble or sparingly soluble indicators for use in aqueous environments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides a way to utilize, in an aqueous environment, indicator components which by themselves are insoluble or sparingly soluble in an aqueous environment.  Such indicators are, in effect, copolymerized with one or more monomers which are sufficiently hydrophilic such that the resulting indicator macromolecule is sufficiently hydrophilic overall so as to overcome the hydrophobic contribution of the indicator component monomers.<br>
Suitable indicator components include indicator molecules which are insoluble or sparingly soluble in water, and whose analyte is at least sparingly soluble in water.  Suitable analytes include glucose, fructose and other vicinal diols; a-hydroxy acids; ß-keto acids; oxygen; carbon dioxide; various ions such as zinc, potassium, hydrogen (pH measurement), carbonate, toxins, minerals, hormones, etc.  It will be appreciated that within the scope of indicator component monomer as used herein are included mixtures of two or more individual monomers (at least one of which is not sufficiently soluble to function adequately in an aqueous environment) which, when incorporated into the macromolecules of the present invention, function as an indicator.<br>
Many such indicator components are known.  For example, the compounds depicted in U.S. Patent 5,503,770 are useful for detecting saccharides such as glucose, but are sparingly soluble to insoluble in water.  Other classes of indicators include the lanthanide chelates<br>
-6-<br><br>
disclosed in copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/265,979 filed March 11, 1999 (and published as PCT International Application WO 99/46600 on September 16, 1999), incorporated herein by reference; polyaromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives; the indicators disclosed in co-pending application Serial No. 09/754,217 filed January 5, 2001 and application Serial No. 60/269,887 filed February 21, 2001, both of which describe indicators having two recognition elements capable of discriminating between glucose and interfering 	?-hydroxy acids or (3-diketones, etc.<br>
The indicator components of the present invention will generally have a detectable quality that changes in a concentration-dependent manner when the macromolecule is exposed to the analyte to be measured.  Many such qualities are known and may be used in the present invention.  For example, the indicator may include a luminescent (fluorescent or phosphorescent) or chemiluminescent moiety, an absorbance based moiety, etc. The indicator may include an energy donor moiety and an energy acceptor moiety, each spaced such that there is a detectable change when the macromolecule interacts with the analyte.  The indicator may include a fluorophore and a quencher, configured such that the fluorophore is quenched by the quencher when the analyte is absent.  In that situation, when the analyte is present, the indicator undergoes a configurational change which causes the quencher to move sufficiently distant from the fluorophore so that fluorescence is emitted.  Conversely, the fluorophore and quencher may be configured such that' in the absence of analyte, they are sufficiently separated and the fluorophore emits fluorescence; upon interaction with the analyte, the fluorophore and<br>
—7—<br><br>
quencher are moved in sufficient proximity to cause quenching.  The configurational change concept is described in more detail in co-pending application Serial No. 09/754,219, filed January 5, 2001, entitled "Detection of Analytes", incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other detectable moieties include those whose fluorescence is affected by analyte interaction via photoinduced electron transfer or inductive effects. These include the lanthanide chelates disclosed in copending U.S. Application Serial No. 09/265,979 filed March 11, 1999 (and published as PCT International Application WO 99/46600 on September 16, 1999), incorporated herein by reference; polyaromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives; coumarins; BODIPY® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); dansyl; catechols; etc. Another class of moieties include those whose absorbance spectrum changes upon interaction of the indicator compound with the analyte, including Alizarin Red, etc. Another class of moieties include those whose fluorescence is modulated by proximity effects, e.g., energy donor/acceptor pairs such as dansyl/dabsyl, etc.<br>
Preferably, the detectable quality is a detectable optical or spectral change, such as changes in absorptive characteristics (e.g., absorptivity and/or spectral shift), in fluorescent decay time (determined by time domain or frequency domain measurement), fluorescent intensity, fluorescent anisotropy or polarization; a spectral shift of the emission spectrum; a change in time-resolved anisotropy decay (determined by time domain or frequency domain measurement), etc.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic monomers should be sufficiently hydxophilic so as to overcome the sum of the hydrophobic<br>
-8-<br><br>
indicator component monomers, such that the resultant indicator macromolecule is capable of functioning in an aqueous environment.  It will be readily apparent that a wide variety of hydrophilic monomers are suitable for use in the present invention.  For example, suitable hydrophilic monomers include methacrylamides, methacrylates, methacrylic acid, dimethylacrylamide, TMAMA, vinyls, polysaccharides, polyamides, polyamino acids, hydrophilic silanes or siloxanes, etc., as well as mixtures of two or more different monomers.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic monomers for a given application will vary according to a number of factors, including intended temperature of operation, salinity, pH, presence and identity of other solutes, ionic strength, etc.  It would be readily apparent that the degree of hydrophilicity of the indicator macromolecule can be increased by adding additional functional constituents such as ions (e.g., sulfonate, quartenary amine, carboxyl, etc.), polar moieties (e.g., hydroxyl, sulfhydryl, amines, carbonyl, amides, etc.), halogens, etc.<br>
It will be appreciated that the molar ratio of hydrophilic monomer to indicator component monomer may vary widely depending on the specific application desired.  Preferred ratios of hydroplilic monomer:indicator component monomer range from about 2:1 to about 1000:1, more preferably from about 5:1 to about 50:1.<br>
The indicator macromolecules of the present invention may generally be synthesized by simply copolymerizing at least one indicator component monomer with at least one hydrophilic monomer.  Optimum polymerization conditions (time, temperature, catalyst, etc.) will vary according<br><br>
to the specific reactants and the application of the final product, and can easily be established by one of ordinary skill.<br>
It will be appreciated that the indicator macromolecules of the present invention may have any desired extent of water solubility.  For example, the indicator macromolecule of Examples 1 and 2 below is very soluble, readily dissolving in aqueous solution.  On the other hand, indicator macromolecules containing, for example, the hydrophilic monomer HEMA (hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or other common hydrogel constituents, can be non-soluble yet hydrophilic.<br>
The soluble indicator macromolecules may be used directly in solution if so desired.  On the other hand, if the desired application so requires, the indicator macromolecule may be immobilized (such as by mechanical entrapment, covalent or ionic attachment or other means) onto or within an insoluble surface or matrix such as glass, plastic, polymeric materials, etc.  When the indicator macromolecule is entrapped within, for example, another polymer, the entrapping material preferably should be sufficiently permeable to the analyte to allow suitable interaction between the analyte and the indicator components in the macromolecule.<br>
Many uses exist for the indicator macromolecules of the present invention, including uses as indicators in the fields of energy, medicine and agriculture.  For example, the indicator macromolecules can be used as indicator molecules for detecting sub-levels or supra-levels of glucose in blood, tissues, urine, etc., thus providing valuable information for diagnosing or monitoring such diseases as diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.  Medical/pharmaceutical production of<br><br>
glucose for human therapeutic application requires monitoring and control.<br>
Uses for the present invention in agriculture include detecting levels of an analyte such as glucose in soybeans and other agricultural products.  Glucose must be carefully monitored in critical harvest decisions for such high value products as wine grapes.  As glucose is the most expensive carbon source and feedstock in fermentation processes, glucose monitoring for optimum reactor feed rate control is important in power alcohol production.  Reactor mixing and control of glucose concentration also is critical to quality control during production of soft drinks and fermented beverages, which consumes the largest amounts of glucose and fermentable sugars internationally.<br>
When the indicator macromolecules incorporate fluorescent indicator substituents, various detection techniques also are known in the art that can make use of the macromolecules of the present invention.  For example, the macromolecules of the invention can be used in fluorescent sensing devices (e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,517,313) or can be bound to polymeric materials or other substrates such as test paper for visual inspection.  This latter technique would permit, for example, glucose measurement in a manner analogous to determining pH with a strip of litmus paper.  The macromolecules described herein may also be utilized as simple reagents with standard benchtop analytical instrumentation such as spectrofluorometers or clinical analyzers as made by Shimadzu,.Hitachi, Jasco, Beckman and others.  These molecules would also provide analyte specific chemical/optical signal transduction for fiber<br><br>
optic-based sensors and analytical fluororaeters as made by Ocean Optics (Dunedin, Florida), or Oriel Optics.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a fluorescence sensing device in which the macromolecules of the present invention can be used to determine the presence or concentration of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound in a liquid medium.  The sensing device comprises a layered array of a fluorescent indicator molecule-containing matrix (hereafter "fluorescent matrix"), a high-pass filter and a photodetector.  In this device, a light source, preferably a light-emitting diode ("LED"), is located at least partially within the indicator material, or in a waveguide upon which the indicator matrix is disposed, such that incident light from the light source causes the indicator molecules to fluoresce.  The high-pass filter allows emitted light to reach the photodetector, while filtering out scattered incident light from the light source.<br>
The fluorescence of the indicator molecules employed in the device described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313 is modulated, e.g., attenuated or enhanced, by the local presence of an analyte such as glucose or other cis-diol compound.<br>
In the sensor described in U.S. Patent 5,517,313, the material which contains the indicator molecule is permeable to the analyte.  Thus, the analyte can diffuse into the material from the surrounding test medium, thereby affecting the fluorescence emitted by the indicator molecules.  The light source, indicator molecule-containing material, high-pass filter and photodetector are configured such that at least a portion<br><br>
of the fluorescence emitted by the indicator molecules impacts the photodetector, generating an electrical signal which is indicative of the concentration of the analyte (e.g., glucose) in the surrounding medium.<br>
In accordance with other possible embodiments for using the indicator macromolecules of the present invention, sensing devices also are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,910,661, 5,917,605 and 5,894,351, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The macromolecules of the present invention can also be used in an implantable device, for example to continuously monitor an analyte in vivo (such as blood or tissue glucose levels).  Suitable devices are described in, for example, co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/383,148 filed August 26, 1999, as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 5,833,603, 6,002,954 and 6,011,984, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The macromolecules of the present invention have unique advantages.  For example, absorbance of a sample is directly proportional to both the concentration of the absorber and the sample path length.  Thus, in an absorbance-based assay, it is apparent that for a given level of absorbance, the sample path length may be greatly reduced if the absorber concentration is greatly increased.  That desirable increase in concentration may be accomplished by decreasing the ratio of the hydrophilic monomer:indicator component monomer.  In effect, the present invention allows the localized concentration of much more absorber component into a limited space, thereby increasing the absorbance per unit thickness.  Thus the present invention additionally allows use of much smaller equipment when performing absorbance-based assays.  It will also be apparent that<br><br>
for any optically-based assay, including fluorescence based assays, the ability to greatly increase the local concentration of the indicator component offers several advantages.  For example, a higher local concentration of the indicator component can permit the utilization of thinner layers of indicator macromolecule, which in turn can greatly reduce the response time of the macromolecule to the presence or concentration of the analyte. Further, it can result in a higher extinction of excitation light, which can desirably reduce the incidence of autofluorescence when working in tissue systems or physiological solutions.  For example, when working with a fluorescence based macromolecule, non-absorbed excitation light can interact with, e.g., NADH, tryptophan, tyrosine, etc. which may be present in tissue or physiological solutions resulting in undesirable interfering fluorescent emission from those moieties. Having a high local concentration of indicator component with high absorption can reduce that undesired interfering emission.  Additionally, when utilizing an absorbance-based macromolecule in tissue or physiological solutions, it is desirable to reduce the amount of the source radiation that is reflected in potentially varying amounts by components in surrounding tissue or fluid, such as bilirubin, e.g.  Therefore, having a high local concentration of indicator component with high absorption can reduce that undesired effect.<br>
As a further aspect of the present invention, it has been discovered that certain macromolecules exhibit an excimer effect.  By way of background, when two planar molecules with aromatic structure (such as is common with fluorophores) are concentrated to a point where their pi electron orbital lobes may overlap, a resonance condition<br><br>
can then occur for some species where the resonance from overlap results in a hybrid (couplet) structure which is energy favorable and stable.  These two planar molecules become oriented in a coplanar configuration like two slices of bread on a sandwich with their electron clouds overlapping between them.  For fluorescent planar species, a characteristic downfield emission occurs relative to the uncoupled species at wavelength of substantially lower energy than the parent species. Molecules able to form such favorable resonant configurations are known as excimers.  As used herein, an excimer effect refers to the resulting characteristic longer wavelength emission from excimers.<br>
Some examples of typical excimer-forming polyaromatic hydrocarbons include anthracene and pyrene.  There are many others.  An example is the anthracene derivative (boronate included), the indicator component used in Examples 1 and 2 of the present application.  Although anthracene is known to form excimers in solution, one must be able to concentrate the molecule to sufficiently high levels to observe any excimer character.  In the case of the anthracene derivative of Examples 1 and 2, the molecule is insoluble in water and insufficiently soluble in a solvent such as methanol to observe excimer characteristics.  In the present examples, the relative concentration of the anthracene derivative monomer was increased in proportion to the hydrophilic monomer in the copolymer from 500:1, 400:1, 200:1, 100:1, 50:1, 25:1, 15:1 and then 5:1.  All have the characteristic blue emission at 417 nm of the anthracene derivative except at 5:.l ratio, a green emission suddenly appears.  This green emission is that of an excimer hybrid and the emission has been shifted downfield by approximately 100+<br><br>
nanometers (-515-570 ran, green).  The concentration of the overall solution does not need to be high since the distance between planar species is being controlled by placement along the polymer backbone rather than soluble concentration in 3-D space.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the excimer emission region is not responsive to changes in analyte concentration, but is responsive to all other aspects of the system analyzed, such as excitation intensity, temperature, and pH.  As a result, the present indicator macromolecules may serve as both an indicator and an internal reference.  For example, an ideal referencing scheme is one where the emission intensity at an indicator wavelength (i.e., the wavelength influenced by the analyte) is divided optically using select bandpass filters, by the emission intensity at the excimer wavelength.  The resultant value corrects for interfering factors which affect fluorescent emission properties, such as fluorescent quenching by, e.g., oxygen, drift and error in pH, power factors and drift affecting LED intensity, ambient temperature excursions, etc.<br>
It will be readily appreciated that the<br>
macromolecules of the present invention which exhibit an excimer effect will be useful in both aqueous and non-aqueous environments.  Consequently, those macromolecules, as well as the component monomers (excimer-forming and other monomer) , may range from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, depending upon the desired application.<br>
Also, when the excimer macromolecules of the present invention are used to detect the presence or concentration of an analyte, the macromolecule may be<br><br>
used directly in solution, or may be immobilized as described above.<br>
The macromolecules of the present invention can be prepared by persons skilled in the art without an undue amount of experimentation using readily known reaction mechanisms and reagents, including reaction mechanisms which are consistent with the general procedures described below.<br>

It was saturated with nitrogen and then heated to 70°C in 1 hour, and kept at 70°C for 80 minutes, and a viscous liquid was obtained.<br>
The liquid obtained was treated with water (26 mL) and filtered through a microfilter (0.45 urn) to give a clear solution.  After dialysis through a cellulose acetate membrane (MWCO 3500) with water 5 L x 4), it was concentrated with polyethylene glycol (MW 20 K) to a clear solution (34.54 g).  Concentration: 24.0 mg solid in 1.0 g solution, total solid 829 mg, yield 79.5%.<br><br>

Glucose Modulation of 50:1 and 25:1 Co-polymers<br>
The modulation of the fluorescence of the 50:1 and 25:1 indicator macromolecules by glucose solutions having various concentrations is shown below in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the results using two different concentrations (15 mg/ml and 25 mg/ml) of the 25:1 indicator macromolecule of this example with four different glucose concentrations.  Table 2 shows the results using two different concentrations (10 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml) of the 50:1 indicator macromolecule of this example with four different glucose concentrations.  In both Tables, I/Io is the ratio of the emitted intensities at 420 nm after and before exposure to glucose (365 nm excitation).<br>
Table 1<br><br><br><br>
Example  2<br>
This  example demonstrates  a  surprising and useful excimer  effect  present  in  connection with the  5:1 indicator macromolecule prepared  in Example  1.<br>
Figure   1   depicts  the  emission   spectra  of  the   5:1 indicator macromolecule when  exposed to  three concentrations   of  glucose   (0  mM,   30  mM  and  60  mM)   after excitement  by  light  at  365   nm.      Also   shown  in  the   shaded region  of   Figure   1  is  the  emission  of  the  non-excimer 25:1   indicator macromolecule   from  Example   1.     The  excimer emission   region  shows  an   "isosbestic  region"   rather  than an   isosbestic  point.     It   can  be   seen  from  Figure   1   that the  excimer  emission  region   (the  region where the   0  mM, 30  mM  and   60 mM glucose  lines  overlap)   is  not  responsive to  changes  in  glucose concentration   (just  like  an isosbestic  point).     The  excimer   emission  region begins approximately  100  nm downfield  from the peak responsive wavelength  of  the  anthracene  derivative  modulation. Except   for  glucose,   the  excimer   is   responsive  to   all other  aspects  of  the  system,   such  as  excitation intensity,   temperature,   and pH.     Therefore,   an  ideal referencing  scheme  is  one  where  the  amplitude  or  signal value   at   415   nm  is   divided  electronically by the amplitude   or   signal  value  at   515   nm or  another wavelencrth<br><br>
or range of wavelengths within the excimer emission region, and the resultant value will be corrected for drift and error in pH, power factors and drift affecting LED intensity, ambient temperature excursions, etc.  That is demonstrated below.<br>
Demonstration of Excitation Intensity , Temperature and pH Correction<br>
The glucose modulation of the 5:1 indicator macromolecule was measured with three different glucose solutions (0 mM, 100 mM and 200 mM).  The emission spectra were determined for each of the glucose solutions at three different spectrophotometer slit configurations for source and emitted light (1.5 being narrower and 3 being wider).  The data are shown in Table 3.  In the Table, the ratio of the emission intensity at 420 nm to the emission intensity at 550 nm is relatively independent of slit configuration.<br>
Table 3<br><br><br><br>
The pH stability of the 5:1 excimer indicator macromolecule was also determined.  The ratio of the emissions at 420 ran and 550 ran for a 1 mg/ml solution of the 5:1 excimer indicator macromolecule at three different pH levels (6.5, 7.0 and 7.5) were determined (excitation light at 370 ran, slits 1.5,3), and are shown in Table 4.  The full emission spectra are shown in Figure 2.  The variation over the range tested was statistically insignificant.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
It   is  believed that  the   stability of the excimer complex   (presumably  through  the  pi   cloud)   exceeds   that   of the  non-excimer anthracene derivative,   and,   that  the boronate  recognition  feature,   which is  able  to perturb the  properties  of the non-excimer,   and thus make  a   good indicator,   is  not able to perturb  the more  stable  excimer complex  and  thus  the  excimer makes   a  very  good  reference indicator.      The  reference molecule  is   structurally unaltered  from the  read channel  indicator.     The polymer matrix may be the  same,   and  in this  example  is   in  fact the   same  macromolecule.      The   recognition  element   is   open and  intact,   but  the   inductive  energy influence between recognition  element  and  fluorophore  center  has  been muted.<br>
The   foregoing is  guite  significant,   because  it   can eliminate  the  need  for  separate physical  and/or chemical environments  between  indicator and reference molecules.<br>
Example  3<br><br>
The synthesis of a suitable lanthanide chelate indicator component monomer is depicted in Figure 3. Compounds (1) and (2) are commercially available from Macrocyclics, Richardson, TX (compound (2) is known as p-NH2-Bz-DOTA).  The end product (9) may be co-polymerized with one or more other monomers to form an indicator macromolecule.<br>
