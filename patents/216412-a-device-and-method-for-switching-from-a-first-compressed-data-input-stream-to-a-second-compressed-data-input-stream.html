				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of and its corresponding device for switching from a first compressed data input stream to a second compressed data input stream, resulting in a compressed data output stream.<br>
Such an invention can be useful, for; example, for switching and editing MPEG compressed video signals.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
International patent application WO 99/05870 describes a method and device of the above kind. This patent application relates, in encoding/decoding systems, to an improved method of switching from a first encoded video sequence to a second one. In order to avoid underflow or overflow of the decoded buffer, a transcoding of the input streams is used to shift the temporal position of the switching point and to obtain at the output of the transcoders, sfreams containing an identical entry point and the same decoder buffer characteristics.<br>
The previously described method has several major drawbacks. According to the background art, the output bit rate of each transcoder is equal to its input bit rate, which makes the switching method not very flexible. Moreover, said method implies that the first picture of the second video sequence just after the switch will be an Intra-coded (I) picture.<br>
Finally, the solution of the background art is rather complex and costly to implement as the switching device needs two transcoders.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method of switching and its corresponding device that is both flexible and easy to implement.<br>
To this end, the invention relates to a switching device as described in the field of the invention and comprising:<br><br>
a buffer system intended to store the data contained in ine nrst ana second input<br>
streams,<br>
control means intended to control the storage of the input streams in the buffer system<br>
in order to switch, at a switch request, from the first input stream to the second input<br>
stream using a commutation device,<br>
and a transcoding system intended to provide the output stream in a seamless way<br>
from the output of the commutation device.<br>
The present invention allows to switch from a first compressed data stream encoded at a bit rate Rl to a second compressed data stream encoded at a bit rate R2, the output stream resulting from the switch being encoded again, using the transcoding system, at a bit rate R where R may be different from Rl and R2. Thus, such a switching device has a flexible behavior.<br>
The switching device according to the invention is also characterized in that:<br>
-	the buffer system comprises a first buffer and a second buffer intended to store the<br>
data contained in the first and the second input stream, respectively,<br>
-	the transcoding system comprises one transcoder,	<br>
-—	—	—...„....«—	<br>
-	the commutation device is controlled to switch from the output of the first buffer to <br>
the output of the second buffer when said first buffer has transmitted a set of M	<br>
pictures of the first input stream, said second buffer being controlled by the control   <br>
means to transmit an I picture,	<br>
-	and said switching device comprises means for generating B pictures without forward<br>
predictions for a set of M pictures of the second input stream including said I picture.<br>
As this switching device uses only one transcoder, its implementation will be less complex and less expensive.<br>
Finally, the switching device according to the invention is characterized in that:<br>
-	the buffer system comprises a first buffer and a second buffer intended to store the<br>
data contained in the first and the second input stream, respectively,	^^<br>

for decoding and second means for decoding,	/<br>
-	the commutation device is controlled to switch from the first input stream after	(<br>
decoding by the first means to the second input stream after decoding by the second	^<br>
means when the first buffer has transmitted a set of M pictures of the first input	 <br>
stream, the second buffer being controlled by the control means to transmit an I    ")<br>
picture or a P picture, which is re-encoded as an I picture using decoding-encoding<br>
means,	/<br>
-	and said switching device comprises means for generating B pictures without forward<br>
predictions for a set of M pictures of the second input stream including said I picture.<br>
Such a switching device allows to switch to a second compressed video stream that is starting with a P picture. Thus, the flexibility of the system is increased.<br>
These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to an improved device for switching and editing of compressed data signals. It relates, more especially, to MPEG signals but is also applicable to any type of compressed data such as, for example, those provided by H-261 or H-263<br><br>
standards of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The principle of the switching device according to the invention is depicted in figure 1.<br>
Such a switching device SW allows to switch from a first compressed data input stream IS 1 to a second compressed data input stream IS2, resulting in a compressed data output stream OS.<br>
This switching device comprises a buffer system BS intended to store the data contained in the first and second input streams, and control means CONT which controls the storage of the input streams in the buffer system in order to switch, at a switch request SWR, from the first input stream to the second input stream, using a commutation device COM.<br>
A transcoding system TS is intended to receive the data stream at the output of the commutation device and to provide the output stream in a seamless way. The use of a transcoding system allows to avoid an underflow or an overflow of the buffer of the decoder that will have to decode the output stream. Moreover, said transcoding system allows to encode the output stream at a bit rate R, where R may be different from the bit rate Rl of the first input stream and the bit rate R2 of the second input stream.<br>
The present invention Avill now be described more specifically for MPEG video data switching. Figure 2 is a block diagram corresponding to a first embodiment of a switching device of MPEG video streams. In this first embodiment, the switching device comprises:<br>
-	a first buffer BUFl and a second buffer BUF2 intended to store the data contained in the first and the second input stream, respectively,<br>
-	a commutation device COM, and<br>
-	a transcoder TRANS.<br>
The switching operation from a first video input stream to a second video mput stream can be performed if the second input stream starts, in the order of transmission, with a picture with no reference to the past (Intra-coded (I) picture) and if the last presented picture of the first input stream, in the order of display, has no reference to the future (Predicted (P) picture or I picture). Furthermore, the bidirectional (B) pictures following, in the order of transmission, the first inserted picture of the second input stream shall not contain forward predictions, that is, the first inserted Group Of Pictures (GOP) of the second input stream has to be a closed GOP. For this purpose, the switching device according to the invention also comprises means for generating B pictiu-es without forward predictions for the<br><br>
first set of M pictures of the second input stream transmitted after switching, M being the distance between two consecutive I or P pictures.<br>
As a first consequence, if the second input stream does not start with a closed GOP, then the first B pictures following the I picture will be:<br>
—	either ejected<br>
-	or replaced by Uniform Color (UC) pictures obtained by freezing the last picture, in<br>
the order of display of the first input stream, or by freezing the first I picture of the<br>
second input stream.<br>
As a second consequence, the commutation device is intended to switch from the output of the first buffer to the output of the second buffer when said first buffer has transmitted a set of M pictures, said second buffer being ready to transmit an I picture. To this end, the two buffers are at least N pictures long, where N is the distance between two consecutive I pictures and are filled using a writing pointer and read using a reading pointer, the writing and reading pointers being controlled by a controller. At a switch request, the reading of the current set of M pictures (PicBk-aBk-i or I|cBk.2Bk.i in the order of transmission and Bic-jBk-iPk or Bk-iBk-iIk in the order of display) in the first buffer is first completed, then the commutation device switches to the output of the second buffer while the reading pointer of the second buffer is positioned at the beginning of the current I picture.<br>
The transcoder according to the invention comprises a Variable Length Decoding block VLD and a dequantization block DQ for decoding the incoming stream, connected in series to a quantization block Q and a Variable Length Coding block VLC for re-encoding the stream, and a buffer BUF. To prevent overflow or underflow of this buffer, a regulation REG is performed; the buffer occupancy is controlled by a feedback to the DCT coefficient quantization. When switching from a video sequence encoded at a bit rate Rl to another one that has been separately encoded at a bit rate R2, the respective decoder buffer delays at the switching point do not match. The role of the transcoder is to compensate the difference between these buffer delays in order to provide the output stream OS in a seamless way. Furthermore, the encoded bit rate R of the output stream can be chosen by the user.<br>
In this first embodiment, the first picture of the second input stream can only be an I picture, as this first picture must not have reference to previous pictures, which are included in the first input stream. Moreover, the switching operation is reversible, which means that, at a switch request, a switch can also be made from the second input stream to the first input stream.<br><br>
The transcoder of figure 2 is a simple one which mainly contains requantization means. Figures 3 and 4 show a switching device comprising more complex transcoders using motion compensation means. Such motion compensation means are used to correct the error drift on P/B pictures that occurs when only requanti2ation means are used. In figure 3, the transcoder comprises:<br>
-	a decoding channel comprising a Variable Length Decoding block VLD cormected in series to a dequantization block DQ,<br>
-	an encoding-decoding channel comprising a quantization block Q connected in series to a Variable Length Coding block VLC, the output of the quantization block also being cormected to an extra dequantization block DQm,<br>
-	an interface sub-assembly, cormected between the decoding channel and the encoding-decoding channel, and comprising:<br><br>
■	a first subtractor si, whose positive input receives the output of the decoding chaimel and whose output is cormected to the input of the Q block,<br>
■	a second subtractor s2, whose positive input receives the output of the DQm block and whose negative input is connected to the output of the first subtractor,<br>
■	an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCT, a frame memory MEM, a motion compensation block MC and a Discrete Cosine Transform block DCT, all cormected in series between the output of the second subtractor and the negative input of the first subtractor, the motion compensation being performed fi-om motion vectors representing the motion of each macro-block of the current picture relative to the corresponding macro-block of a previous picture in the transmission order.<br>
In figure 4, the transcoder is more sophisticated and comprises:<br>
-	a decoding chaimel comprising a Variable Length Decoding block VLD connected in series to a dequantization block DQ and an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCT,<br>
-	an encoding-decoding channel comprising a Discrete Cosine Transform block DCT cormected in series to a quantization block Q and a Variable Length Coding block VLC, the output of the quantization block also being connected to an extra dequantization block DQm followed by an extra Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCTm,<br><br>
-	an interface sub-assembly, connected between the decoding channel and the<br>
encoding-decoding channel, and comprising:<br>
■	a first subtracter si, whose positive input receives the outut of the decoding channel and whose output is connected to the input of the DCT block,<br>
■	a second subtracter s2, whose positive input receives the output of the IDCTm block and whose negative uaput is connected to the output of the first subtracter,<br>
■	a fi:ame memory MEM and a motion compensation block MC connected in series between the output of the second subtracter and the negative input of the first subtracter.<br>
Figure 5 is a block diagram corresponding to a second embodiment of the switching device. In this second embodiment, the switching device comprises:<br>
-	a buffer system comprising a first buffer BUFl and a second buffer BUF2, said buffers being at least M pictures long,<br>
-	a transcoding system comprising:<br><br>
■	a first decoding channel, whose input corresponds to the output of the first buffer, comprising a first Variable Length Decoding block VLDl cermected in series to a first dequantization block DQl,<br>
■	a second decoding channel, whose input corresponds to the output of the second buffer, comprising a second Variable Length Decoding block VLD2 connected in series to a second dequantization block DQ2,<br>
■	an encoding charmel comprising a quantization block Q connected in series to a Variable Length Ceding block VLC and a buffer BUF providing the encoding output stream OS, regulation means REG for controlling the buffer occupancy by a feedback to the quantization block,<br><br>
-	a conunutation device comprising a first commutator COMl, whose inputs are the outputs of the dequantization blocks DQl and DQ2 and which is connected, before switching from the first input stream to the second input stream, to the output of the DQ2 block, and a second commutator COM2 having three inputs A, B and C, whose input A is the output of the dequantization block DQl, whose input B is the output of the dequantization block DQ2 and whose output C is the input of the encoding channel,<br>
-	and a decoder comprising:<br>
■	an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCTa,<br><br>
■	an adder a, whose first input is the output of the IDCTa block and a subtractor s, whose positive input is the output of the adder,<br>
■	a frame memory MEMa and a motion compensation block MCa connected in series, on the one hand to the output of the adder and, on the other hand to the second input of the adder and the negative input of the subtractor,<br>
■	and a Discrete Cosine Transform block DCTa, which receives the output of the subtractor and whose output is the third input C of the commutator COM2.<br>
In comparison with the previous schemes, the decoder has been added and allows to switch from a first input stream to a second input stream at a P picture of said second input stream. For this purpose, the decoder decodes all the P picture of the second input stream arriving before the switch from the first input stream to the second input stream. During this step, the first input stream is transcoded. Once the user wants to switch to the second input stream, the last decoded P picture, provided at the output of the IDCTa block, is re-encoded as an I picture provided at the output of the adder. Furthermore, the B pictures following this new I picture are modified into B pictures having only backward vectors thanks to the motion compensation means MCa and the subtractor, B pictures without forward predictions are, for example, uniform color pictures as previously described in the first embodiment.<br>
As a consequence, at a switch request, the reading of the current set of M pictures in the first buffer is completed first. Then, the commutator COM2 switches from input A to input C, the decoder being ready to transmit the decoded P picture that has been re-encoded as an I picture and the rest of the set of M pictures. Finally, the commutator COM2 switches from C to B, the reading pointer of the second buffer being positioned at the begiiming of the second set of M pictures.<br>
In this second embodiment, the first picture of the second input stream can be an I picture or a P picture. The switching operation is also reversible, which means that a switch can be made, at a switch request, from the second input stream to the first input stream, the commutator COMl being connected, before the switch, to the output of the DQl block and the commutator COM2 being positioned at input B.<br>
The transcoder of figure 5 is a simple one that mainly contains a requantization step. Figures 6 and 7 show a switching device comprising more complex transcoders using motion compensation means.<br>
In figure 6, the transcoder comprises:<br><br>
-	an interface sub-assembly, connected between the second commutator and the<br>
encoding channel, and comprising:<br>
■	a first subtractor s 1, whose positive input receives the output of the second commutator and whose output is connected to the input of the Q block,<br>
■	a second subtractor s2, whose positive input receives the output of a dequantization block DQm connected to the output of the Q block, and whose negative input is connected to the output of the first subtracter,<br>
■	an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCT, a fi-ame memory MEM, a motion compensation block MC and a Discrete Cosine Transform block DCT, all connected in series between the output of the second subtractor and the negative input of the first subtractor.<br>
In figure 7, the transcoder comprises:<br>
-	the two decoding channels described in figure 5 with, in addition, an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCTl or IDCT2 coimected between the output of DQl or DQ2 block and the input A or B of the second commutator, respectively,<br>

-	a third decoding channel connected to the output of the Q block and comprising an extra dequantization block DQm followed by an extra Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform block IDCTm,<br>
-	an mterface sub-assembly, connected between the second conmiutator and the encoding channel, and comprising:<br><br>
■	a first subtractor si, whose positive input receives the output of second commutator and whose output is connected to the input of the DCT block,<br>
■	a second subtractor s2, whose positive input receives the output of the DDCTn, block and whose negative input is connected to the output of the first subtractor,<br>
■	a fi-ame memory MEM and a motion compensation block MC connected in series between the output of the second subtractor and the negative input of the first subtractor.<br><br><br>
