COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
" AN ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING RF WAVES" <br>
AMC CENTURION AB, a Swedish company of Box 500, SE-184 25, AKERSBERGA, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an antenna system including an antenna device and feed device for transmitting and receiving FR waves. Specifically, it relates to a system for a mobile radio communication device, e.g., a hand-portable telephone, which is capable of both transmitting and receiving on multiple separate frequency bands.<br>
In  the  communication  services   today  it  is  an  increasing  demand for availability and small  sizes  of  the  user units.   A user  of a  hand-portable  communication unit  wishes  to be  reached wherever  his  location may be.   This  puts  requirements  on  the operators  to provide  for good coverage  of  their mobile networks.   For  areas with  few users,   e.g.   in  low-populated areas,   at  the   countryside,   or  at   sea,   it   is  uneconomical  or impossible   to  provide  for  good  coverage  by means   of terrestrial mobile phone  systems.   For  such  areas,   good coverage  can be  obtained by means  of  communication  via satellites.   Since  communication  with  linearly polarised RF waves,   which are used in the  terrestrial  mobile  communication systems,   requires  a  certain degree  of  alignment  between  the transmitting  and receiving antennas,   this  type  of  signals  are unsuitable  for  satellite communication.   Instead  circularly polarised RF waves  are  used.   This means   that  a  special   type  of antenna has  to be used.   It  is practical  when the  same mobile telephone  can  be used for both  satellite  communication  and terrestrial communication-  To obtain this,   telephones  have been provided with  two antennas.<br><br><br>
This does not comply with the demands on antennas for hand-portable telephones, to be compact, and to occupy a small space.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
US-A-5,628,057 discloses a radiotelephone transmitter having an antenna for satellite communication. The antenna is attached to the telephone at a pivot point. This antenna only operates in a circular polarisation mode, and is not provided with means for operation in a linear polarisation mode.<br>
Each of WO 96/06468, WO 97/37401 and EP 0 791 978 discloses an antenna for receiving circularly polarised RF waves in a satellite positioning system (GPS). Each of the antennas includes a ceramic core having four helical radiating elements. A feeder line passes through the core from the bottom of the antenna, and is connected to the radiating elements at the top of the antenna. The self phasing structure of the antenna and the feeding thereof makes the antenna operable in a very narrow frequency band, viz. a relative bandwidth of a few tenths of a percent. This is sufficient since the antenna is designed for receiving GPS signals. It is not suitable for two way radio communication, where a relative bandwidth of a few or up to ten percent is required.<br>
Further, ys-A-5.600,341 discloses an antenna operating with circular polarisation and linear polarisation. A QHA (quadrifilar helical antenna) for circular polarisation is stacked on a linear antenna fed by a two wire helix. The linear antenna operates with linear polarisation and a part of the antenna function is performed by the two wire helix, although some coupling to the feed line will occur. This<br><br>
document does not teach how the quadrifilar helical antenna should operate with linear polarisation. No phasing network is described, and the helix is therefore supposed to be self-phased although this is not mentioned. A self-phased helix is an antenna operating in a very narrow frequency-band, and usually limited to GPS service where 
JP-A-09219621 discloses an antenna for linear polarisation stacked on a helical antenna for circular polarisation. Since a helical antenna having less then three helices normally need to have a circumference of X to give circular polarisation, this antenna must be very space demanding or work in some other way which is not explained. No phasing network is present, and is not needed if the helices are self-phased, but then a very narrow frequency band is achieved.<br>
JP-A-08298410 discloses an antenna including two helices, one inside the other. The inner helix is extendable, and when extended it acts as an antenna for circular polarisation. Since only one helical element is present the circumference has to be X  in order to give circular polarisation, why also this antenna must be very space demanding. In the retracted state of the inner helix the antenna acts as an antenna for linear polarisation. No phasing network is needed since only one helical element is employed for achieving the circular polarisation.<br><br><br>

It is also an object of the invention to provide an antenna system providing good isolation between the radiating structure for circularly polarised waves and the means for excitation of said radiating structure for operation with linearly polarised waves, in order to avoid that the high transmission power for one polarisation mode will damage the sensitive receiver of the other polarisation mode.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an antenna system which exhibits high efficiency in different frequency bands and modes of operation, and advantageous radiation lobe pattern.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide an antenna system that exhibits broad band characteristics, necessary for radio telephone use within most systems.<br>
These and other objects are attained by an antenna means according to the appended claims.<br>
By the features of claim 1 it is achieved an antenna system having a good antenna function, since the current maximum in linear polarisation mode can be located high above a telephone.<br>
Through the arrangement of a central radiator in the radiating structure, it is achieved an efficient and uniform excitation of the helical radiating elements in order to provide for<br><br>
Transmission/reception of linearly polarised RF waves in a second mode of operation.<br>
Through the arrangement of the centrally arranged radiator protruding beyond the second end of the radiating structure for circularly polarised RF waves, it is achieved an improved antenna operation in the linear polarisation mode.<br>

characterised in<br>
-	that means are arranged for essentially uniform excitation of the<br>
helical radiating elements in order to provide for<br>
transmission/reception of linearly polarised RF waves in a second<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to Figure   1,   an antenna  system including an antenna device and feed device for transmitting and receiving RF waves in connection to a radio communication device, according to the invention is diagrammatically shown. The<br><br>
system shown in Figure 1 is designed for communication via satellite by means of circularly polarised RF waves. It includes a radiating structure 10, which comprises a support 11, which can be a flexible film, a flexible printed circuit board (PCB), or a solid tubular body. On the support 11, a number N of conductive helical radiating elements, are coextending and coaxially arranged. In the figure N=4, but it could be any number greater than 1. However, it is preferred that N is greater 2, in order to achieve isolation (discrimination) between right-hand and left-hand circular polarisation. The smallest number for N in order to achieve this discrimination is 3, which gives the most space efficient solution. N=4 is mostly used, since it is suited for common types of components. The helical radiating elements are denoted 12 A-D, and preferably have a width being several times their thickness, e.g. four times. The radiating elements may be formed by initially plating the surface of the support 11 with a metallic layer, and then selectively etching away the layer to expose the support according to a pattern applied in a photographic layer similar to that used for etching printed circuit boards. Alternatively the metallic material may be applied by selective deposition or by printing techniques. The radiating structure 10 can also be manufactured by the use of MID (moulded interconnection device) technology, and it is possible to form the helical radiating elements in wire form.<br>
The radiating structure 10 is shown to have a circular cross section, but it could be of other shapes, e.g. quadratic, and still be included in a coaxial configuration.<br>
The so formed N-filar radiating structure 10 has a first end 15 and a second end 14. At the first end 15, the helical<br><br>
radiating elements 12 A-D are provided with a respective feed point, or feed portion 13 A-D.<br>
A feeding means 20 is connected to the radiating structure 10, for feeding and reception of signals. The feeding means 20 possibly comprises a diplexer 30 having an input Tx for signals to be transmitted by the antenna system and comes from the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device, and an output Rx for signals received by the antenna system to be transmitted to the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device. When the antenna is<br>
retractable/extendable it is preferred that the diplexer 30, if needed, is included in the circuitry of the radio communication device. In that case the connection between the diplexer and the feeding means 20 preferably is a flexible coaxial cable. The output 31 of the diplexer 30 or the output of the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device is connected to a phasing network 21. The phasing network comprises a 90° power divider, which divides the signals on the input into two signals, one phase shifted 90° in relation to the other. Each of the outputs of the 90° power divider is connected to the input of a 180° power divider, dividing the signals on the input into two signals, one phase shifted 180° in relation to the other. Thus the feeding means 20 has four outputs, with signals phase shifted 0°, 90° ,180° and 270° respectively. Each of the outputs is connected, possibly via matching means 23 A-D, with a respective feed portion 13 A-D, so as to obtain a progressive phase shift on the feed portions 13 A-D. The matching means are used for providing a predetermined impedance, preferably 50 ohm, of the antenna structure, towards the connected circuits. A signal put on the Tx input of the diplexer and so divided into phase shifted<br><br>
signals and fed to the radiating structure 10 will create a circularly polarised RF wave to be radiated by the radiating structure 10. In the general case with N helical radiating elements, there are N feed portions, matching means and outputs of the phasing network, which provides a progressive phase shift, where the exact choice of components is obvious to a person  skilled in the art. Preferably, the progressive phase shift is 360°/N. However without full geometric symmetry of the helical radiating elements the phases are shifted accordingly. The phase shift between each pair of feed portions corresponds to the angle between them. When the angle between a line from the centre axis of the radiating structure through a first feed portion and a line from the centre axis of the radiating structure through a second feed portion is for example 4 5°, the phase shift between the feed portions is selected to be 45°.<br>
Since the radiating structure 10 and the feeding means 20 are passive, they will operate reverse when receiving a circularly polarised RF wave polarised in the same direction.<br>
It is preferable that the 180° power dividers consists of wide band baluns, i.e. giving good balance for all involved frequency bands, since signals having the same phase on the feed portions 13 A-D, e.g. linearly polarised signals received by the radiating structure 10, then will cancel each other, and not enter the circuitry of the radio communication device. The 90° power divider preferably consists of a 90° hybrid.<br>
The radiating structure 10 preferably has a diameter d in the range 10- 14 mm, and a length 1 preferably in the range 80-120 mm, for operation in the frequency range 1.4- 2.5 GHz.<br><br>
The so described antenna device and feed device can be used for radio communication in systems using satellites, and also for receiving signals in positioning systems using satellites, e.g. GPS. The radio communication systems using satellites usually operate in relatively wide bands (e.g. at centre frequencies between 1.4 and 2.5 GHz) and in some cases bands widely separated in uplink and downlink (e.g. 1.6 GHz and 2.5 GHz) . Therefore broad band antenna systems must be used in such applications. Through the design of the radiating structure 10 and the feeding means 20 the antenna system described has broad band characteristics. Self phasing helical antennas customer used for GPS are generally too narrow in bandwidths for radio telephone purposes.<br>
Figure 2 shows the feeding means 20 of the antenna system according to Figure 1, when adapted for use in a first mode of operation, when transmitting/receiving circularly polarised RF waves, as described above, and for use in a second mode of operation when transmitting/receiving linearly polarised RF waves. The operation in the second mode is used for radio communication in a terrestrial communication system e.g. a GSM, PCN, DECT, AMPS, PCS, and/or JDC cellular telephone system.<br>
To provide for operation in the second mode, a diplexer 24 A-D is connected on one of its inputs to a respective output of the phasing network 21. The other input of each diplexer is connected to a common line 25 connected to the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device for communication with linearly polarised RF waves. When the antenna is retractable/extendable this line preferably is a flexible coaxial cable. The outer conductor should be connected to a<br><br><br>
ground structure or ground plane. The output of each diplexer is connected to the respective matching means 23 A-D. Through this feeding the signals put on the feed portions 13 A-D, entered through line 25, will have the same phase, and the radiating structure 10 will operate essentially as a straight radiator. Also here where the components are passive the operation when receiving a signal is reverse to that of transmitting a signal.<br>
The feeding means 20 and possibly the diplexer(s) are preferably arranged on a PCB or other suitable .means, and are constituted of discrete or distributed components.<br>
Figure 3 shows the radiating structure 10 broken up, and an arrangement for the excitation or feeding of the helical radiating elements 12 A-D for them to operate with linearly polarised RF waves. The radiating structure 10 is coupled to the feeding means 20 and the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device, and operates in the first mode, in the same or similar manner as described in connection with Figures 1 and 2. For the operation in the second mode, with linearly polarised RF waves, a straight radiator 16 is arranged coaxially with the radiating structure 10.<br>
The straight radiator 16 is fed at its feed portion 13 at its first end, which preferably is located essentially in the plane of the first end 15 of the radiating structure 10. The feed portion 13 is connected with the line 25A, possibly via a matching means 23. The line 25A is connected with the transceiver circuits of the radio communication device. When the line is a flexible coaxial cable, as described above, the outer conductor is connected with a ground structure or ground<br><br>
plane. The second end of the straight radiator 16 is a free end.<br>
The length of the straight radiator 16 can be smaller than the length of the radiating structure 10. Preferably the straight radiator 16 is about 10-20 mm longer than the radiating structure 10, as illustrated with the dotted lines in the figure.<br>
When the straight radiator 16 is fed with a signal it couples to the radiating structure 10, which will be excited and radiate essentially as a straight radiator. When receiving an RF signal the operation is the reverse. In the case the straight radiator 16 extends beyond the second end of the radiating structure 10, the portion not surrounded by the radiating structure 10 will operate as a straight radiator.<br>
Figure 4 shows a variation of the embodiment of Figure 3, with the difference being the construction of the centrally arranged radiator. This radiator comprises a feed line 16, acting as a straight radiator, connected at its second end to a normal mode helical radiator 17. A normal mode helical radiator is a helically wound single wire radiator having a circumference « X.   The length of the combined radiator 16+17 can be the same as in the previous embodiment, and is preferably longer than the radiating structure 10.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further variation of the embodiment of Figure 3, with the difference being the construction of the centrally arranged radiator. This radiator comprises a straight radiator 16 extending beyond the second end 14 of the radiating structure 10, and is provided with a capacitive top loading<br><br>
18. The straight radiator 16 is provided with a conductive cross-like element 18 with the ends folded down. The element 18 is seen in a top view in Figure 6. Through this capacitive top loading 18, the current maximum of the centrally arranged radiator is moved towards the second end, with improved antenna performance. The cross structure prevents circulating currents in   the capacitive  top load  element   18.<br>
Figure 7 shows a further variation of the embodiment of Figure 3, with the difference being the construction of the centrally arranged radiator. This radiator comprises a normal mode helical radiator 17. The length of the radiator 17 can be longer than the radiating structure 10 or the same, but preferably it is shorter.<br>
Figure 8 shows a further variation of the embodiment of Figure 3, with the difference being the construction of the centrally arranged radiator. This radiator comprises a sleeve antenna, with a sleeve 19 and a radiator denoted 17. The pocket under the folded back sleeve 19 has an electrical length being essentially L./4, and prevents currents from flowing on the outside of the feeding cable 25A. The radiator 17 can be straight or helical e.g. a normal mode helical radiator. The electrical length of the radiator 17 is preferably also essentially L./4. The sleeve antenna can be shorter then the radiating structure 10 or have the same length. However, it is to prefer that it is longer and will protrude beyond the second end of the radiating structure 10. When using a sleeve antenna, the matching means can possibly be excluded. The sleeve antenna is fed by a coaxial cable 25A with the outer conductor connected to a ground plane means or similar structure.<br><br><br>
Linearly polarised RF waves received by the radiating structure 10 will cause signals being in phase on the feed portions 13 A-D. If they are not separated by diplexers as in the embodiment of Figure 2, they can enter the transceiver circuits for circularly polarised RF waves of the radio communication device through the phasing network 21. In the cases where the received linearly polarised RF waves are coupled to a centrally arranged radiator it is advantageous to cancel or drain off these signals. This can be made by means of filters 40 A-D, shown in Figure 9. Each filter is connected at one end with a respective feed portion 13 A-D of the radiating structure 10. The other ends of the filters are connected to each other and to signal ground. These filters have resonance frequency at the frequencies of the linearly polarised RF waves which are well separated from those of the circularly polarised RF waves.<br>
Figure 10 shows a hand portable telephone provided with antenna system according to the invention. The antenna including the radiating structure 10 and the radiators 16, 17 ,18, 19 are preferably protected by an electrically insulating cover 51. The antenna is shown in its retracted position in the figure. It is seen that a part of the antenna protrudes from the telephone housing 50, even if the antenna is in its retracted position. This is advantageous, since the antenna then can operate in the satellite system with paging function and standby mode or even call mode in the terrestrial systems.<br>
The housing of the telephone may be conductive, providing shielding to the PCB(s) of the unit, and connected to signal ground. A ground plane can be formed by the housing 50 of the telephone or a portion thereof, which is connected to the<br><br><br>
signal ground of transceiver circuits of the telephone. The ground plane could alternatively be a conductive plate, conductive foil or a printed circuit board.<br>
Although the invention is described by means of the above examples, naturally, many variations are possible within the scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
