				<td>QUINOLINE DERIVATIVES AS ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS<br>
The present invention relates to the use of quinoline derivatives for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a bacterial infection.<br>
Resistance to first-line antibiotic agents is an emerging problem. Some important examples include penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, muhi-resistant salmonellae.<br>
The consequences of resistance to antibiotic agents are severe. Infections caused by resistant microbes fail to respond to treatment, resulting in prolonged illness and greater risk of death. Treatment failures also lead to longer periods of infectivity, which increase the numbers of infected people moving in the community and thus exposing the general population to the risk of contracting a resistant strain infection. Hospitals are a critical component of the antimicrobial resistance problem worldwide. The combination of highly susceptible patients, intensive and prolonged antimicrobial use, and cross-infection has resulted in infections with highly resistant bacterial pathogens.<br>
Self-medication with antimicrobials is another major factor contributing to resistance. Self-medicated antimicrobials may be unnecessary, are often inadequately dosed, or may not contain adequate amounts of active drug.<br>
Patient compliance with recommended treatment is another major problem. Patients forget to take medication, interrupt their treatment when they begin to feel better, or may be unable to afford a full course, thereby creating an ideal environment for microbes to adapt rather than be killed.<br>
Because of the emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics, physicians are confronted with infections for which there is no effective therapy. The morbidity, mortality, and financial costs of such infections impose an increasing burden for health care systems worldwide.<br>
Therefore, there is a high need for new compounds to treat bacterial infections, especially for the treatment of infections caused by resistant strains.<br>
WO 2004/011436 discloses substituted quinoline derivatives having activity against Mycobacteria, in particular against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. One particular compound of these substituted quinoline derivatives is described in Science (2005), 307, 223-227.<br>
It has now been found that quinoline derivatives described in WO 2004/011436 also show activity against other bacteria than Mycobacteria.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to the use of a compound for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a bacterial infection, said compound being a compound of formula (la) or (Ib)<br>

The Ar or Het listed in the definitions of the substituents of the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) (see for instance R3) as mentioned hereinbefore or hereinafter may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (Ta) or (Tb) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when Het is imidazolyl, it may be 1 -imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl and the like.<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
When two vicinal R6 radicals are taken together to form a bivalent radical of formula -CH-CH-CH=CH-, this means that the two vicinal R6 radicals form together with the phenyl ring to which they are attached a naphthyl.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not, are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove or hereinafter are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfbnic, 4-methyl-benzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with arnino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.<br>
The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The N-oxids forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.<br>
The compounds of formula (la) and (Ib) may be converted to the corresponding TV-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its W-oxide form. Said JV-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tbutyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketoncs,<br>
e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their W-oxides or addition salts may contain one or more centres of chirality and exist as stereocheraically isomeric forms.<br>
Compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) and some of the intermediate compounds invariably have at least two stereogenic centers in their structure which may lead to at least 4 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (la) and (lb), and their Af-oxides, addition salts or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enanliomers of the basic molecular structure. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusammen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (la) and (Ib) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-mgold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R* ] or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R *,R *] indicates centers with the same chirality and [/?*,£*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R*,S*]. If "a" and "ß" are used : the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric<br>
carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "ß", if it is on the olher side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
When a specific slereoisomeric form is indicated, this means that said form is substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 50 %, preferably less than 20 %, more preferably less than 10 %, even more preferably less than 5 %, further preferably less than 2 % and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomer(s). Thus, when a compound of formula (la) or (Ib) is for instance specified as (otS, PR), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (αR, (ßS) isomer.<br>
The compounds of either formula (la) and (Tb) may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecifk methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The tautomeric forms of the compounds of either formula (la) and (Tb) are meant to comprise those compounds of either formula (la) and (Ib) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto group (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient. For example,<br>
the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al., "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985, 29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to either Formula (la) and (Ib), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically •isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the Af-oxide forms thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COOR*, where Rx is a C1-6alky 1, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRyRz, wherein Ry is H, Ci-ealkyl, phenyl or benzyl and R2 is -OH, H, C1-6 alkyl, phenyl or benzyl.<br>
Compounds according to the invention having an amino group may be derivatised with a ketone or an aldehyde such as formaldehyde to form a Mannich base. This base will hydrolyze with first order kinetics in aqueous solution.<br>
Whenever used herein, the term "compounds of formula (la) or (Ib)" is meant to also include their pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts, their JV-oxide forms, their tautomeric forms or their stereochemically isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) which are stereochemically pure.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Of some compounds the absolute stereochemical configuration of the stereogenic carbon atom(s) therein was not experimentally determined. In those cases the stereochemically isomeric form which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" isomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by a person skilled in the art, using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br>
In case "A" and "B" are stereoisomeric mixtures, in particular mixtures of diastereoisomers, they can be further separated whereby the respective first fractions isolated are designated "Al" respectively "Bl" and the second as "A2" respectively "B2", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "Al", "A2" and "Bl", "B2" isomeric forms, in particular said "Al", "A2" and "Bl", "B2"enantiomeric forms, can be unambiguously characterized by a person skilled in the art, using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.<br>
Hereinafter, "THF" is defined as tetrahydrofuran, "DMF" is defined as N,N-dimethylformamide, "DIPE" is defined as diisopropyl ether and "GDI" is defined as 1,1 '-carbonyldiimidazole.<br>

-Pharmacological examples<br>
Preparation of bacterial suspensions for susceptibility testing:<br>
The bacteria used in this study were grown overnight in flasks containing 100 ml Mueller-Hinton Broth (Becton Dickinson - cat. no. 275730) in sterile de-ionized water, with shaking, at 37 °C. Stocks (0.5 ml/tube) were stored at -70 °C until use. Bacteria titrations were performed in microtiter plates and colony forming units (CPUs) were determined. In general, an inoculum level of approximately 100 CPUs was used for susceptibility testing.<br>
Anti bacterial Susceptibility testing: ICyo determination<br>
Microtitre plate assay<br>
Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180 n\ of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes in column 2. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 \il in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to reach column 11. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Depending on the bacteria type, approximately 10 to 60 CPU per well of bacteria inoculum (100 TCTD50), in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours under a normal atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, one day after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fiuorometrically. Therefore resazurin (0.6 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 20 ul to all wells 3 hours after inoculation, and the plates were re-incubated overnight. A change in colour from blue to pink indicated the growth of bacteria. The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 run. The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods. The lG&gt;o (expressed in ug/ml) was defined as the 90 % inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 8 below.<br>
MIC99 values (the minimal concentration for obtaining 99 % inhibition of bacterial<br>
growth) can be determined by performing the standard Agar dilution method according<br>
to NCCLS standards* wherein the media used includes Mueller-Hinton agar.<br>

bacteria that grows Aerobically: approved, standard -sixth edition<br>
Time kill assays<br>
Bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the compounds may be determined in a time kill assay using the broth microdilution method *. In a time kill assay on Staphyiococcus aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the starting inoculum of S. aurues and MRSA is 106 CPU / ml in Muller Hirrton broth. The antibacterial compounds are used at the concentration of 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (ie. IC9Q as determined in microtitre plate assay). Wells receiving no antibacterial agent constitute the culture growth control. The plates containing the microorganism and the test compounds are incubated at 37 °C. After 0, 4, 24, and 48 hrs of incubation samples are removed for determination of viable counts by serial dilution (10-1 to 10-6) in sterile PBS and plating (200 ul) on Mueller Hinton agar. The plates are incubated at 37 "C for 24 hours and the number of colonies are determined. Killing curves can be constructed by plotting the logioCFU per ml versus time. A bactericidal effect is commonly defined as 3-logio decrease in number of CFU per ml as compared to untreated inoculum. The potential carryover effect of the drugs is removed by serial dilutions and counting the colonies at highest dilution used for plating. No carryover effect is observed at the dilution of 10*2 used for plating. This results in limit of detection 5 X 102 CFU / ml or

Determination of cellular A TP levels<br>
In order to analyse the change in the total cellular ATP concentration (using ATP bioluminescence Kit, Roche), assays are carried out by growing a culture of S. aureus (ATCC29213) stock in 100 ml Mueller Hinton flasks and incubate in a shaker-incubator for 24 hrs at 37 °C (300 rpm). Measure 00405 nm and calculate the CFU/ml. Dilute the cultures to 1 x 106 CFU/ml (final concentration for ATP measurement: 1 x 10s CFU/100 ul per well) and add test compound at 0.1 to 10 times the MIC (Le. ICjo as determined in microtitre plate assay). Incubate these tubes for 0, 30 and 60 minutes<br>
at 300 ipm and 37 °C. Use 0.6 ml bacterial suspension from the snap-cap tubes and add to a new 2 ml eppendorf tubes. Add 0.6 ml cell lysis reagent (Roche kit), vortex at max speed and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cool on ice. Let the luminometer warm up to 30°C (Luminoskan Ascent Labsystems with injector). Fill one column (= 6 wells) with 100 ul of the same sample. Add 100 ul Luciferase reagent to each well by using the injector system. Measure the luminescence for 1 sec.<br>
