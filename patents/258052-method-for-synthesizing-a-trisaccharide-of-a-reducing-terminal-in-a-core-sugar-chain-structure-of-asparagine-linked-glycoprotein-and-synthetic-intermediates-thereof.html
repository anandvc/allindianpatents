SPECIFICATION<br>
SYNTHESIS OF CORE SUGAR CHAIN STRUCTURE OF ASPARAGINE-LINKED GLYCOPROTEIN<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a field of chemical synthesis of sugar chain, and specifically, to a convenient method for chemically synthesizing sugar chains of glycoprotein and a synthetic intermediate thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Glycoprotein means a protein comprising a moiety of oligosaccharide referred to as a sugar chain.<br>
Recently, glycoprotein has been found to be closely involved with biological processes such as cell adhesion or signaling, and structures of sugar chains which trigger various biological processes have gradually emerged. However, only a small amount of glycoprotein is expressed in a living body for the sugar chain to mediate a biological process, and it is quite difficult to obtain pure glycoprotein in sufficient quantity to determine the chemical and physical properties of the sugar chain.<br>
An asparagine-linked glycoprotein is one of the glycoproteins and ubiquitously found in human serum or ovalbumin. The asparagine-linked glycoprotein is classified into a high mannose-type, a complex type and a mixed type according to characteristics of a branch of the sugar chain and/or constituting sugar. All of these types have a common core sugar chain structure of a penta-saccharide comprising<br><br>
three molecules of mannose and two molecules of N-acetyl glycosamine at the reducing terminal of the chain;<br><br>
the core sugar chain structure of asparagine-linked glycoprotein<br>
Accordingly, chemical synthesis of the core sugar chain structure shown in the formula above provides the basis for studying the function of asparagine-linked sugar chain.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
However, an efficient method for synthesizing the core sugar chain structure of the asparagine-linked sugar chain is not yet known. One of the reasons is that the core sugar chain structure contains a moiety chemical synthesis of which is quite difficult.<br>
In the chemical synthesis of the core sugar chain structure, it is extremely difficult to form a bond of mannose β-glycoside, that is a bond of β-manno-glycoside (Manβ1 —&gt;4-GlcNAc). The reason comes from the facts that a neighboring group effect is not available since 2-OH group of mannose is linked at the axial position and the β-manno glycoside bond brought an electrically unstable structure against an anomer effect typically found in sugars.  Kunz et al. discloses a chemical method for preparing a {β-manno glycoside structure, which<br><br>
contains a complicated process and requires the time and cost of running (Kunz, H. and Gunther, W. (1988) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27, 1086-1087).<br>
Other reasons why a bond of p-manno glycoside (Manβl—&gt;4-GlcNAc) is difficult to be formed are that the acceptor of the glycosilation reaction is N-acetyl glucosamine of low solubility in the reaction medium and the reactivity of 4-OH group is low compared with the other OH groups (reactivities of OH groups; 1-OH&gt;&gt;6-OH&gt;&gt;2-OH&gt;3-0H&gt;4-0H).<br>
In addition, synthesis of a structure of GlcNAc β 1—&gt;4GlcNAc has some problems in the chemical synthesis of the core sugar chain structure of asparagine-linked sugar chain.<br>
As described above, synthesis of the trisaccharide (Man β 1 —&gt; 4GlcNAβ 1—&gt;4GlcNAc) at the reducing terminal especially remains as a big problem in the chemical synthesis of the core sugar chain structure of asparagine-linked sugar chain. In order to synthesize the core sugar chain structure, how to synthesize the p-manno glycoside bond effectively is especially an issue to be solved.<br>
The inventors of the present invention focused their attention to a natural polysaccharide having the structure of mannoside β1—&gt;4 bonds, especially galactomannan, guar gum and mannan, which have mannoside β1—&gt;4 bonds.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to break the primary barrier in the synthesis of the core sugar chain structure, specifically to form a p-manno-glycoside bond by using a disaccharide unit of Man β1 —&gt;4Man comprised in a structure of natural polysaccharides, and to establish an efficient method for synthesizing the structure of the core sugar chain.<br><br>
As a result, the present invention relates to a method comprising,<br>
(1)	a process of preparing a compound of mannose disaccharide(a<br>
type of ManP1β1—&gt;4ManP1)shown with a formula (I);<br><br>
wherein P1 is an OH-protecting group and the wavy line means that -OP1 is linked at an axial or equatorial position or mixture of both, by hydrolyzing a polysaccharide having mannose β-l,4-bonds, preferably galactomannan, guar gum or mannan having mannose β-1,4-bonds, more preferably a galactomannan derivative shown with a formula (V);<br><br>
(n is an integer of 50 or more)<br>
or a mannan derivative shown with a formula (VI);<br><br>
(n is an integer of 50 or more)<br>
and protecting hydroxyl groups of the resulted compound,<br>
(2)	each process for converting the obtained mannose<br>
disaccharide compound (a type of ManP1β1—&gt;4ManP1) into a glycal<br>
compound in which mannose at the reducing terminal of the mannose<br>
disaccharide compound is changed into a glycal, by halogenating and<br>
reducing the mannose disaccharide, and<br>
(3)	preparing an azide disaccharide compound (a type of ManP1βl<br><br>
—&gt;HManP1) shown with a formula (II) in which the 2-azide group of mannose in the reducing terminal is linked at the equatorial position;<br><br>
wherein P1 is the same above, and the wavy line means that -NO2 is linked at an axial or equatorial position or mixture of both, by azidenitration reaction of the glycal compound above,<br>
(4)	each process for substituting the nitro group of the azide<br>
disaccharide compound (a type of ManP1β1—&gt;4ManP1) with a leaving<br>
group, preferably<br>
(4-1) substituting the nitro group of the azide disaccharide compound (a type of ManP1βl—&gt;4ManP1) with a -OP10 group (P10 is an OH-protecting group), and preparing a trihaloacetoimidate derivative by reacting with trihaloacetonitrile after removal of the P10 group, or<br>
(4-2) substituting the nitro group of the azide disaccharide compound (a type of ManP1—&gt;4ManP1) with a leaving group, and<br>
(5)	preparing a trisaccharide compound (a type of Manβl—&gt;<br>
4GlcNP1βl—&gt;4GlcNP2) shown with a formula (III);<br><br>
wherein P1, P2, P3 and P11 are the same above,<br>
by reacting the derivative above in which a leaving group was<br>
introduced with amino-protected glucopyranoside of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein P2 and P11 are an OH-protecting group and P3 is an amino-protecting group, and<br>
(6) a process for preparing an asparagine-linked trisaccharide compound (Manβ1—&gt;4GlcNP1βl—&gt;4GlcNP2) shown with a formula (IV);<br><br>
wherein P1 and P2 are the same above, P4 and P6 are independently amino protecting groups and P5 is a carboxyl-protecting group, and a method of each process, when preparing the trisaccharide (Man β 1—&gt;4GlcN β1—&gt;4GlcN) at the reducing terminal of the core sugar chain structure in the asparagine-linked glycoprotein.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the azide disaccharide compound (a type of Manβl—&gt;4M-ManP1) of the formula (II) which is a useful synthetic intermediate in the methods of the present invention;<br><br>
wherein P1 is an OH-protecting group, the wavy line means that -NO2 is linked at an axial or equatorial position or mixture of both, and to the trisaccharide compound shown with the formula (III);<br><br>
wherein P1, P2 and P11 are OH-protecting groups and P3 is an amino-<br><br>
protecting group.<br>
According to the present invention, the trisaccharide moiety(Manβ1—&gt;4GlcNβ—&gt;4GlcN) of the reducing terminal in the core sugar chain structure of the asparagine-linked glycoprotein sugar chain is easily synthesized and it is useful to clarify the function and structure-characteristics of the asparagine-linked glycoprotein which causes various life processes.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The outline of the novel route for synthesizing the core sugar chain structure in the present invention is deβcted as follows;<br><br>
wherein the wavy line means that the -Oβ or nitro group is linked at an axial or equatorial position or mixture of both.<br>
At first, the disaccharide compound (I), Manβl—&gt;4Man, is obtained after acid hydrolysis of a polysaccharide having mannose (3-1,4-bonds and acetylation of the product. Next, it is converted to the glycal derivative wherein mannose of the reducing terminal was converted to glycal by a chemical method, and followed by azide nitration reaction to give the compound (II). The compound (II) which has the equatorial 2-azide group at the reducing terminal can be transformed to the moiety of Manβ—&gt;4GlcNAc in the core sugar chain<br><br>
structure and is a useful key intermediate.<br>
Thus, the intermediate (II) is easily converted to the moiety of Man4GlcNAc which is difficult to prepare through other synthetic scheme, while the intermediate (II) can be easily prepared in a large scale at a reasonable cost from the compound (I), which is available from galactomannan, guar gum or mannan derivatives.  Furthermore, the trisaccharide compound (III), which is ready to be converted to the trisaccharide (Manβ1—&gt;4GlcNAcβ—&gt;4GlcNAc) of the reducing terminal in the core sugar chain structure, is synthesized when the intermediate (II) is used as a glycosyl donor.<br>
Thus, the inventors of the present invention succeeded to simplify the scheme for synthesizing the trisaccharide of the reducing terminal in the core structure by utilizing a natural polysaccharide available at a low cost.<br>
In the following description, each process of the present invention is explained in detail. Process (1)<br>
In Process (1), the compound (I) of mannose disaccharide (Manββ1—&gt;4Manβ) is prepared from a polysaccharide having mannoseβ-l,4-bonds. At first, a polysaccharide having mannoseβ-l,4-bonds is hydrolyzed, the OH groups are protected and the desired disaccharide is isolated.<br>
As a starting material, a polysaccharide having mannoseβ-1,4-bonds, preferably galactomannan, guar gum or mannan having mannosep-l,4-bonds, more preferably a galactomannan derivative of the formula (V);<br><br><br>
whrein n is an integer of 50 or more<br>
or a mannan derivative of the formula (VI);<br><br>
wherein n is an integer of 50 or more is used.<br>
Galactomannan derivatives (also referred to as<br>
galactomannoglycan) are extensively present in seeds of legume family, e.g., alfalfa or clover. Galactomannan in the seeds of guar (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus) and carob or locust bean (Ceratonia siliqua) is available in the market as gum products derived from pants.<br>
Guar gum extracted from guar seeds is a natural polysaccharide having a straight sugar chain comprising a series of mannose βl—&gt;4 bonds wherein galactose is linked through a 1—&gt;6bond to every mannose residue as a branch. Almost uses of this material are food additives such as thickeners of various canned products, quality improving agent (inhibitor of shape-loosing) or taste-regulator of various foods and easily available at an extremely low cost.<br>
A mannan derivative is a generic name of polysaccharides comprised of D-mannose. βant mannan derivatives contained in endosperm of ivory nut or bulbs of orchidaceous βant have straight chain structure in which D-mannose residues are linked through β1—&gt; 4 bonds and insoluble in water.<br><br>
In detail, these are described in "Comprehensive Dictionary for Utilization of Regional Biological Resources", Ed., Hiroshi Fujimaki, 1998, Rural Culture Association; Y. C. Lee, et al. (1977) Analytical Biochem., 79, 329-337; and Shiryo Yaga, et al. (1995) Mokuzai Gakkaishi, vol.41, No 4, 440-443.<br>
Usually, acid hydrolysis is apβied to hydrolyze polysaccharides having mannosep-l,4-bonds. For the purpose, sulfuric acid, preferably 10-20% sulfuric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or sulfuric acid-acetic acid is used and the reaction temperature of 50-70°C is preferable.<br>
Materials of which the polymerization degree is equal or more than 9 are removed by isolation of galactomannan soluble in 70%EtOH. In general, the polymerization revel is increased the more, the derivative remains in the insoluble residue.<br>
In order to protect the hydroxyl group, acetyl, benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, benzoyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydroβranyl, torimethylsilyl, and triethylsilyl group etc., are usually used.<br>
Isolation of the disaccharide is achieved by silica gel chromatography and/or HβC. Process 2<br>
In Process 2, a glycal compound is prepared from the mannose disaccharide compound (I) (a type of Manp1β—&gt;4Manp1. At first, the glycal compound is prepared from the disaccharide by halogenation and successive reduction of the position 1 in mannose of the reducing terminal. Usually, mannose is halogenated around r.t, using hydrogen halide or acid halide etc. Reduction is carried out by using a metal such as zinc etc., while avoiding a reaction at high temperature. Process 3<br>
In Process 3, the azide disaccharide compound (II), in which the<br><br>
2-azide group of mannose in the reducing terminal is linked at the equatorial position, is prepared by azidenitration reaction of the glycal compound.<br>
The azidenitration reaction is carried out by simultaneous azidation and nitration. A mixture of equatorial and axial isomers is provided, and the compound having the 2-azide group of mannose in the reducing terminal at the equatorial position is isolated by purifying the mixture. Process 4<br>
In Process 4 the nitro group in the azide disaccharide compound is substituted for a leaving group, which generally includes fluorine, bromine, chlorine, trichloroacetoimidate, 4-pentenyl, alkylthio (sulfur) and arylthio.<br>
Preferably, the nitro group in the azide disaccharide compound is substituted for the -Op10 group (p10 is an OH-protecting group), and the trihaloimidate derivative is obtained by the reaction with trihaloacetonitrile after removal of the p10 group or a halogenated derivative is obtained by the reaction with hydrogen halide. Alternatively, the -Op10 derivative or p10-deprotected derivative may be converted to the derivatives having a leaving group such as a penteny, acetylthio or arylthio group. Process 5<br>
In Process 5, the resulting derivative having a leaving group is reacted with amino-protected glucopyranoside to prepare the trisaccharide compound (a type of Manβ1—&gt;4GlcNp1β1—&gt;4GlcNP2).<br>
The amino-protected glucopyranoside may be prepared according to the following scheme.<br><br><br>
As the P3 group which is an amino protecting group, phthalimide, tert-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, benzoyl or benzyl group etc. is usually used.<br>
Next, this compound is reacted with the above derivative having a leaving group under acidic (Lewis-acidic) condition. Process 6<br>
In Process 6, the trisaccharide compound is couβed with asparagine. The couβing with asparagines is carried out according to the next scheme, for example.<br><br>
I<br>
  I*<br>
The trisaccharide prepared above may be coupled with an asparagine residue of the desired protein and the sugar chain may be elongated by adding a new sugar unit. Also a pre-elongated sugar chain prepared by adding a sugar unit to the trisaccharide may be introduced to the desired protein.<br>
Alternatively, a protein sequence may be elongated when<br><br>
standard peptide chemistry is apβied to the asparagines residue in the asparagines-linked trisaccharide derivative. Also, a sugar chain may be elongated when standard carbohydrate chemistry is apβied to mannose in the reducing terminal.<br>
