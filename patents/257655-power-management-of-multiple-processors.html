				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>An information handling system having a plurality of physical processors capable of operating in either a low power or a high power state, and capable of running logical processors that may execute program threads. Each program thread is assigned to be executed in a respective logical processor. The assignment of each program thread to the respective logical processor is determined by whether the program thread requires high-utilization or low-utilization of the plurality of physical processors in the information handling system. To conserve power in the information handling system, high-utilization program threads are assigned to be executed in logical processors running in as few physical processors operating in the high power state, and low-utilization program threads are assigned to physical processors operating in the low power state. To maximize execution speed of program threads in the information handling system, high-utilization program threads are assigned to be executed in logical processors running in different physical processors operating in the high power state, and low-utilization program threads are assigned to any physical processor.

				<td>[0001]	The present disclosure relates generally to information handling<br>
systems, and more particularly, to power management of multiple processors in the information handling system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals<br>
and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information.   One option available to users are information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes, thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information.  Because technology and information handling needs and requirements van' between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction   processing,   airline   reservations,   enterprise  data  storage,   or  global communications.  In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage   systems,   and  networking  systems,   e.g.,   computer,   personal  computer workstation, portable computer, computer server, print server, network router, network hub, network switch, storage area network disk array, RAID disk system and telecommunications switch.<br>
[0003]	An information handling system may comprise a plurality of digital<br>
processors, e.g., microprocessors. These digital processors (hereinafter "processors") are able to switch between different clock frequencies and operating voltages with negligible impact to software running on these processors. An operating system may<br><br>
conserve power in the information handling system by operating at least one of the plurality of processors at a lower clock frequency and/or operating voltage when at least one processor is not being fully utilized.<br>
[0004]	Each of the plurality of processors (hereinafter "physical processors")<br>
may operate as a plurality of "logical processors." This is referred to as "Hyperthreading." However, when switching operating voltages, e.g., power state, of each physical processor all of the logical processors associated with that physical processor must operate under the same power state because each physical processor has only one set of power state registers.<br>
[0005]	For   example,   an   information   handling   system   may  have   two<br>
Hyperthreading physical processors where each of these physical processors has two power states, e.g., low-power and high-power. An operating system controlling the two physical processors must execute three threads (program instruction steps) at once, two of these threads require high processor utilization (high power operation) and the third thread only requires low processor utilization (low power operation). Conservation of power is of prime importance, e.g., portable battery operation.<br>
[0006]	Since the operating system is not aware of what logical processor is<br>
associated with which physical processor, the operating system may assign a high-utilization thread and a low-utilization thread to one physical processor, and the remaining high-utilization thread to the odier physical processor. This scenario would require that both physical processors are operating in a high power state.<br>
[0007]	What would be preferred in order to conserve power would be for die<br>
two high-utilization threads to run on one physical processor operating in the high power state and die low-utilization thread to run on the ouier physical processor that may now operate in the low power state.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	If the operating system would know the logical-to-physical processor<br>
mapping, it could have assigned the high-utilization threads to respective logical processors that were associated with just one physical processor running in the high power state, and the remaining low-utilization thread to a respective logical processor<br><br>
that was associated with the other physical processor that need only run in the low power state. Thus power would be conserved without sacrificing performance.<br>
[0009]	Conversely, if maximum operating performance was desired, e.g.,<br>
power consumption was not of primary concern, then assigning only one high-utilization thread to each physical processor and running both of these physical processors in the high power state would be more desirable. Running each high-utilization thread on different physical processors may increase performance ot the information handling system. Thus for a best performance, assigning each high-utilization thread to an associated logic processor running on difference physical processors will yield best performance. Since each of the physical processors is now running in the high power state. The low-utilization thread may be assigned to any logical processor running on either one of the physical processors.<br>
[0010]	A thread may change from high-utilization to low-utilization, or visa-<br>
versa, while it is executing. For example, a thread may use a processor less when it is accessing I/O devices (disk, network, etc.), and then it would use a processor more when it is performing arithmetic on data. Suppose a thread alternates between reading data from the network for a time (low-utilization) and then performing calculations on that data for a subsequent time (high-utilization). The operating system may re-assign the thread to different physical processors while the thread is executing in response to the changes in its utilization requirements.<br>
[0011]	According to specific example embodiments of this disclosure, a<br>
logical-to-physical mapping may be implemented by using an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) object, in accordance with the ACPI Specification, Revision 3, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. The "PSD" (P-State Dependency) object may be used to notify the operating system which logical processors are mapped to the same "domain." Each of the logical processors in a domain shares a dependency with the other logical processors in that domain. A domain may be defined as a physical processor and/or a plurality of physical processors, each domain having a certain power state. Thus, the operating system may have knowledge of which logical processors are associated with each physical processor (domain). The operating system also may know and be<br><br>
able to control the power state for each physical processor. Thus, the information handling system may be configured for optimum low power use, or optimum performance when power use is not of primary concern.<br>

[0022]	While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0023]	For purposes of this disclosure, an information handling system may<br>
include any instrumentality or aggregate of instrumentalities operable to compute, classify, process, transmit, receive, retrieve, originate, switch, store, display, manifest, detect, record, reproduce, handle, or utilize any form of information, intelligence, or data for business, scientific, control, or other purposes. For example, an information handling system may be a personal computer, a network storage device, or any other suitable device and may vary in size, shape, performance, functionality, and price. The information handling system may include random access memory (RAM), one or<br><br>
more processing resources such as a central processing unit (CPU), hardware or software control logic, read only memory (ROM), and/or other types of nonvolatile memory. Additional components of the information handling system may include one or more disk drives, one or more network ports for communicating with external devices as well as various input and output (I/O) devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, and a video display. The information handling system may also include one or more buses operable to transmit communications between the various hardware components.<br>
[0024]	Referring now to the drawings,  the details of specific example<br>
embodiments are schematically illustrated. Like elements in the drawings will be represented by like numbers, and similar elements will be represented by like numbers with a different lower case letter suffix.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figure 1, depicted is an information handling system<br>
having electronic components mounted on at least one printed circuit board (PCB) (motherboard) and communicating data and control signals therebetween over signal buses, according to a specific example embodiment of the present disclosure. In one example embodiment, the information handling system is a computer system. The information handling system, generally referenced by the numeral 100, comprises a plurality of physical processors 110, generally represented by processors 110a-11 On, coupled to a host bus(es) 120. A north bridge 140, which may also be referred to as a memory controller hub or a memory controller, is coupled to a main system memory 150. The north bridge 140 is coupled to the plurality of processors 110 via the host bus(es) 120. The north bridge 140 is generally considered an application specific chip set that provides connectivity to various buses, and integrates other system functions such as a memory interface. For example, an Intel 820E and/or 815E chip set, available from the Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, California, provides at least a portion of the north bridge 140. The chip set may also be packaged as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The north bridge 140 typically includes functionality to couple the main system memory 150 to other devices within the information handling system 100. Thus, memory controller functions such as main memory control functions typically reside in the north bridge 140.   In addition, the<br><br>
north bridge 140 provides bus control to handle transfers between the host bus 120 and a second bus(es), e.g., PCI bus 170, AGP bus 171 coupled to a video graphics interface 172 which drives a video display 174. A third bus(es) 168 may also comprise other industry standard buses or proprietary buses, e.g., ISA, SCSI, I2C, SPI, USB buses through a south bridge(s) (bus interface) 162. A disk controller 160 and input/output interface 164 may be coupled to the third bus(es) 168.<br>
[0026]	Referring to Figure 2, depicted is a schematic block diagram of a<br>
plurality of logical processors running in associated physical processors. Each of the physical processors 110 may have a plurality of logical processors 210 running concurrently therein. This allows each of the plurality of logical processors 210 to execute a different program thread substantially concurrently. Each of the physical processors 110 may operate under different conditions, e.g., voltage, current, clock frequencies, etc., however, all logical processors 210 associated with a physical processor 110 will perform the same based upon that physical processor 110 operating parameters, e.g., low or high power states.<br>
[0027]	When a physical processor 110 is in a high power state, program<br>
(thread) execution by the associated logical processors 210 may perform at higher throughputs than when the physical processor 110 is in a low power state. For example, when a high-utilization thread is executed in a physical processor that is running at higher frequencies/voltages there is a noticeable performance enhancement to a user. However, when a low-utilization thread is executed in a physical processor that is running at higher frequencies/voltages there is negligible performance improvement to the user. Therefore, program threads 202 and 204 are high-utilization threads that may be preferably processed with logical processors 210 running in a physical processor 110 operating in the high power state, e.g., at higher clock frequencies and/or voltages. Program thread 206 is a low-utilization thread that may be adequately processed with a logical processor 210 running in a physical processor 110 operating in the low power state, e.g., at lower clock frequencies and/or voltages.<br>
[0028]	A thread may change from high-utilization to low-utilization, or visa-<br>
versa, while it is executing, e.g., if all threads become low utilization then the operating system may switch all pliysical processors to the low power state.   For<br><br>
example, a thread may use a processor less when it is accessing I/O devices (disk, network, etc.), and then it would use a processor more when it is performing arithmetic on data. Suppose a thread alternates between reading data from the network for a time (low-utilization) and then performing calculations on that data for a subsequent time (high-utilization). The operating system may re-assign the thread to different physical processors while the thread is executing in response to the changes in its utilization requirements.<br>
[0029]	A logical-to-physical mapping for each logical processor 210 and<br>
physical processor 110 may be implemented by using an Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) object, in accordance with the ACPI Specification, Revision 3, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. A P-State Dependency ("PSD") object may be used to notify the operating system which logical processors 210 are mapped to the same physical processors) 110, e.g., "domain(s)." The _PSD object corresponds to multiple states of the processor, e.g., provides processor power state control information to the program operating system. The _PSD object may evaluate to a packaged list of information that correlates with power state information of the physical processors 110.(e.g., domains). Each packaged list entry may identify a dependency domain number for the power states associated with each logical processor 210, the coordination type for those power states and the number of logical processors belonging to a domain. The operating system may then assign program threads based upon each program thread's utilization requirement and available logical processors 210 running in a physical processor operating in an appropriate power stale.<br>
[0030]	Each of the logical processors of a physical processor domain shares a<br>
dependency with the other logical processors 210 in that physical processor domain, e.g., when a physical processor domain changes power states, all logical processors 210 within that physical processor domain change to that domain power state. A physical processor domain may be defined as one physical processor 110 and/or a plurality of physical processors 110, each domain having a certain power state. Thus, the operating system may have knowledge of which logical processors 210 are associated with each physical processor 110 (domain).   The operating system also<br><br>
may know and be able to control the power state for each physical processor 110. Thus, the information handling system may be configured for optimum low power use, or optimum performance when power use is not of primary concern.<br>
[0031 ]	Referring now to Figure 3, depicted is a schematic block diagram of a<br>
plurality of program threads running in associated logical processors selected for minimum power operation, according to a specific example embodiment of the present disclosure. Program threads 202 and 204 are being executed in logical processors 210a that are running in associated physical processor 110a. The physical processor 110a is operating in the high power state and the high-utilization program threads 202 and 204 are being processed at substantially maximum throughputs for two concurrently running high-utilization program threads. Since the low-utilization program thread 206 does not require high throughput for proper execution, a logical processor 21 On running in a physical processor 1 lOn operating in the low power state is adequate. By assigning the two high-utilization program threads 202 and 204 to logical processors 210a running in the same physical processor 110a, and assigning the low-utilization thread 206 to a logical processor 21 On running in a different physical processor 11 On, only the physical processor 110a need be in the high power state. The other physical processor 11 On can remain in a low power state, thus conserving power in the information handling system 100.<br>
[0032]	Referring to Figure 4, depicted is a schematic block diagram of a<br>
plurality of program threads running in associated logical processors selected for maximum program execution speed, according to another specific example embodiment of the present disclosure. Program tliread 202 is being executed in a logical processor 210a and program thread 204 is being executed in a logical processor 21 On. The logical processor 210a is running in the physical processor 110a and the logical processor 21 On is running in the physical processor II On. Both physical processors 110a and 11 On are operating in the high power state. The program thread 206 may be executed in either one of the logical processors 210a or 21 On (processor 210a shown). Therefore since thread 206 is a low-utilization program tliread, it may not substantially affect execution speeds of the logical processors 210 running in the associated physical processor 110.   By assigning each<br><br>
of the high-utilization program threads 202 and 204 to individual logical processors 210 running in different physical processors 110, and assigning the low-utilization thread 206 to a logical processor 210 running in either one of the physical processors 110, maximum program throughput will be achieved in the information handling system 100.<br>
