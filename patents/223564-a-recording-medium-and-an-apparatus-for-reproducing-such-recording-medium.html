				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF MANAGING COPY PROTECTION INFORMATION<br>
OF A RECORDING MEDIUM, RECORDING MEDIUM WITH COPY<br>
PROTECTION INFORMATION FOR CONTENTS RECORDED<br>
THEREON, AND REPRODUCING METHOD FOR THE<br>
RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
1.	Technical   Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of managing copy protection information (CPI) .(for preventing an illegal copying of encrypted contents recorded on a high-density recording medium such as a BD-ROM (Blu-ray Disc ROM) , a recording medium having the copy protection information stored thereon, and a method of reproducing the recording medium.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
The standardization of new high-density optical disks capable of recording large amounts of high-quality video and audio data has been progressing rapidly and new optical disk related products are expected to be commercially available on the market in the near future. The Blu-ray Disc Rewritable (Called 'BD-RE1 in general) is one example of these new optical disks.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a BD-RE disk comprises a clamping area, a transition area, a. burst cutting area (BCA) , a lead-in area, a data area, and a lead.ut area in order- starting from the innermost circumference.<br>
The load-in area comprises .several pre-assigned areas such as a first guard (Guard 1) area, a permanent information &amp; control data (PIC) area, a second guard (Guard 2) area, a second information (Info 2) area, and an optimum power calibration (OPC) area. The Guard 1 area and the PIC area are pre-recorded areas in which some initial data is -pre-recorded,<br><br>
whereas the other areas of . the lead-in area, the data area, and the lead-out areas are all rewritable areas.<br>
In the PIC area, important: information about the dink, which is to be preserved permanently, is encoded in. a wobbled gi~oove by high frequency modulation (HFM) . As shown in FIG. 2, the wobble-shaped data encoding is performed by bi-phase modulation.<br>
In the mean time, the development of the read-only Blu-ray disk (BD-ROM) its also under way along with the development of the BD-RE. A BD-ROM disk comprises an inner area, a clamping area, a transition area, an information area, and a rim area, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The contents of A/V streams are recorded in the data zone belonging to the information area in an encrypted manner using the copy protection information (CPI) with a view to preventing an illegal copying of the contents.<br>
Disc information (DI) such as disc type is recorded in the PIC area belonging to the information area. In the case where the main data recorded in the data zone is encrypted, copy protection information (CPI) for decrypting the encrypted data is also recorded in the PIC area.<br>
When an optical disk (a BD-ROM disk) is loaded into an optical disk reproducing apparatus, the optical disk reproducing apparatus first detects the copy protection information (CPI) recorded in the PIC area and then decrypts the main data recorded in the data zone using the copy protection information (CPI) if the main data is encrypted.<br>
If an error occurs when the apparatus detects the copyprotection information (CPI), which is required to decrypt the encrypted data, the contents of the BD-ROM disk cannot be decoded even if there in no data read error.<br>
3. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is one object, of the invention to provide a method of recording copy protection information on a recording medium that allows reliable read-out of the copy protection information for decrypting contents recorded on thereon.<br><br>
It is another object of the pre.sent invention to provide a receding medium hawing copy protection information for decrypting encrypted contents recorded thereon.<br>
It i ,s .slUl another oh j eft ol tin1 pro.'iont i ii.veut i on to provide: a method of reproducing and decrypting encrypted contents recorded on a recording medium by using copy protection information recorded thereon.<br>
A method of recording copy protection information on a recording medium in accordance with the present invention comprises recording encrypted data on the recording medium, and recording the copy protection information required for decrypting the encrypted, data in a predetermined first area and additionally in an area other than the first area at least once.<br>
A recording medium in accordance with the present invention comprises a data urea storing encrypted data, a first area storing copy protection information required for decrypting the encrypted data, and at least one second area storing a duplicate of the copy protection information.<br>
A method of reproducing a recording medium by a disk reproducing apparatus in accordance with the present invention comprises the steps of (a) driving the recording medium storing encrypted data, (b) detecting copy protection information, which is required for decrypting the encrypted delta, recorded in a first area of the recording medium, and (c) if an error occurs in the detection of the copy protection information, detecting duplicated copy protection information from an area other than the first area and decrypting the encrypted data using the detected copy protection information.<br>
The method of recording and. reproducing the copy<br>
protection information of a recording medium in accordance<br>
with the present invention allows encrypted data recorded on<br>
the recording medium to be reproduced normally even when the<br>
copy protection information cannot be read from the PIC area<br>
in which the copy protection information is supposed to be<br>
recorded, due to scratches, finger-prints, etc.		<br>

5. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
In order that the invention may be fully understood, preferred embodiments thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A BD-ROM disk in accordance with the invention has a disk structure comprising an inner area, a clamping area, a transition area, an information area, and a rim area, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The data zone assigned in the information area stores moving picture contents such as movies. As shown in FIG. 4, the PIC area assigned in the data zone stores the disk information, which is general information about the disk, and the copy protection information (CPI), which is required to decrypt contents recorded in the data zone in an encrypted manner. In case of a BD-ROM disk, the data recording is conducted by forming pre-pits on the surface of the BD-ROM<br><br>
disk.<br>
The disk information and CBI stored in the PIC area is recorded as straight pits, or wobbled pits, or partly a,s wobbled plus and partly as straight pita.<br>
The CBI  stored in the area, which is a key value used co encrypt the main data recorded in the data zone, is duplicated at least once} in areas other than the PIC area.<br>
FIG. 5 shows an example in which the CPI is written additionally in areas other than the PIC area.<br>
In FIG. 5, the duplicated CPI if, found in a reserved area of the lead-in area and in a reserved area of the lead-out area. In FIG. 5, the disk information as well as the CPI is duplicated in these areas.<br>
The CPI may be duplicated at. least once only in the lead-in area, at least once only in the lead-out area, or at least once both in the lead-in area and in the lead-out area.<br>
The areas on a BD-ROM in which the CPI is to be duplicated may be specified by the BD-ROM standard or may vary depending on manufacturers. In the latter case, information on the position of each duplicated CPI is included in the disk information table.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the structure of the disk information table in accordance with the present invention. The disk information table includes various types of information on the disk, including a disk information identifier, disk sise/version, and disk structure. In addition, the disk information table includes information on respective duplicated CPI positions (CPI_position) in a reserved field.<br>
The size of the position information (CPI_position) is proportional to the number of the duplicated CPIs. If information on the position of each duplicated. CPI is assigned 4 bytes and. there are N duplicated CPIs, the size of the position information (CPI_jposition) is '±*N bytes.<br>
In the case where the disk information is duplicated along with the CPI in the lead-in area and/or lead-out area,<br>
.the	Information on	the	respective ..CPI .....positions ...is... also<br>
duplicated.<br><br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a brief block diagram of an optical disk reproducing apparatus in which the present invention may be advantageously embodied. The apparatus, which comprises am optical pickup 11 for reading optical information from a BU-\ROM disk, a Vdp(video disc play) system 12 tor signal processing and servo control, and a D/A converter 13, decrypts the contents recorded on the BD-ROM disk using the copy protection information and outputs A/V .signals by following a procedure illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
If a BD-ROM disk having copy protection information stored thereon, is inserted into the apparatus (S10) , the VDP system 12 rotates the BD-ROM and controls the optical pickup 11 to search the PIC area ol the BD-ROM for the CPI and disk information (Sll)<br>
If an error occurs when reading the CPI (S12) , the VDP system 12 checks if there is an error in the disk information (S13) . If no error is found (S13-1) , the VDP system 12 reads information  on  duplicated  CPI  positions   (CPI_position) recorded in the disk information (S14) and then reads the CPI by moving  the optical pickup  11  to  a position where  a duplicated CPI is written (Sib) . If a read error occurs again, the VDP system 12 moves the optical pickup 11 to a next position where a duplicated CPI is written and reads the CPI recorded therein (S16).<br>
If the disk information read from the PIC area has an error (S13-1), the optical disk reproducing tipparatus reads information on the position of CPI and/or disk information stored in a predetermined position of the apparatus (S20) and reads the CPI by moving the optical pickup 11 to the position (S21).<br>
If the CPI is detected normally, the VDP system 12 moves the optical pickup 11 to the data zone from which to begin reproducing encrypted contents and decrypts the reproduced contents using the CPI (S1V) . And the VDP system 12 decodes the decrypted contents and finally outputs A/V signals (S18).<br>
The described method of recording and reproducing the copy protection information for a recording medium allows<br><br>
encrypted data recorded 011 the recording medium to be reproduced normally even when the copy protection information cannot be read from the PIC area due to scratches, finger prints, etc.<br>
