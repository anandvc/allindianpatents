				<td>A Process For The Preparation Of A Polymer Composite Comprising<br>
Internally distributed Deposition Matter<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a polymer<br>
composite comprising contacting polymer with plasticising fluid and deposition<br>
matter and isolating polymer comprising internally distributed deposition<br>
matter, the polymer composite obtained thereby, and apparatus for the<br>
preparation thereof, a polymer scaffold, drug delivery device or the like<br>
comprising the composite in suitably sized and shaped form, the use as a<br>
pharmaceutical or veterinary product, a human or animal health or growth<br>
promoting, structural, fragrance or cosmetic product, an agrochemical or crop<br>
particularly as a biodegradable slow release product, or as biodegradable<br>
surgical implant, synthetic bone composite, organ module, and the like or for<br>
bioremediation, as a biocatalyst or biobarrier and the like.<br>
The use of supereritical fluids in the produuction of polymers as a plasticising<br>
foaming or purification agent is known. Supercritical fluids (SCFs) act as<br>
plasticisers for many polymers, increasing the mobility of the polymer chains.<br>
This results in an increase in the free volume within the polymeric material.<br>
Supercritical fluid has found application in incorporation of dyes and other<br>
inorganic materials which are insoluble in the supercritical fluid, for example<br>
inorganic carbonates and oxides, into polymers with a good dispersion to<br>
improve quality, in particular dispersion in products such as paints for spray<br>
coating and the like.<br><br>
Moreover the fluid can be used to foam the polymer by transition to non-critical<br>
gaseous state whereby a porous material may be obtained and this has been<br>
disclosed in US 5,340,614, WO91/09079 &amp; US 4,598,006.<br>
US 5,340,614 discloses simultaneously contacting polymer., impregnation<br>
additive and SCF. US 4,598,006 discloses dissolving impregnation additive in<br>
SCF, adding polymer and releasing fluid with transition to subcritical<br>
conditions.<br>
WO 91/09079 (De Ponti) discloses preloading polymer microspheres with an<br>
active ingredient such as a drug by dissolving polymer in solvent, adding a<br>
solution of active ingredient, and mixing in silicone oil to obtain loaded<br>
microspheres. These are washed and hardened. Microspheres are then SCF<br>
processed to produce a porous structure.<br>
However the double emulsion process of WO 91/09079 has shown in some<br>
cases only 68% retained drug activity compared with control and this is<br>
attributed to solvent effects, homogenising the double emulsion, breaking up<br>
droplets and the like.<br>
Moreover this process is quite complex, requiring two polymer processing<br>
stages, and does not necessarily ensure good internal distribution.<br>
Polymers have also been used in biomedical applications to develop materials<br>
in which biocompatibility can be influenced to promote favourable tissue<br>
responses whilst also producing materials with acceptable mechanical and<br>
surface properties. Biofunctional composite materials e.g. calcium<br><br>
hydroxyapatite dispersed in various polymers are well established for<br>
orthopaedic, dental and other applications. These materials are prepared with<br>
very high loadings of inorganic solid, of up to 80%, in the form of a powder,<br>
and a composite is formed either by vigorous mixing of the powdered material<br>
into the solid or molten polymer, or by polymerisation of the monomers in the<br>
presence of suspended inorganic powders. In both cases, the material becomes<br>
entrapped within the polymer matrix.<br>
These methods for preparation however are prone to insufficient and<br>
uncontrolled mixing of material leading to large aggregate formation whereby<br>
the composite is prone to fracture and may not be suitable for commercial<br>
processing.<br>
WO 98/51347 (Howdle et at) discloses the preparation by dense phase fluid<br>
processing of biofunctional polymers comprising biofunctional material having<br>
the desired mechanical properties both for commercial processing and for<br>
implant into a human or animal host structure such as bone or cartilage, dental<br>
and tissue structures into which they are surgically implanted for orthopaedic<br>
bone and implant, prosthetic, dental filling or restorative applications, prolonged<br>
release applications and the like,. Biofunctional material is in particular any<br>
pharmaceutical, veterinary, agrochemical, human and animal health and growth<br>
promoting, structural, cosmetic and toxin absorbing materials, such as a broad<br>
range of inorganic or organic molecules, peptides, proteins, enzymes,<br>
oligosaccharides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and the like.<br>
Particular application is in the production of bone composites formed from a<br>
biofunctional polymer with inorganic calcium hydroxyapatite uniformly<br><br>
distributed throughout. This process uses the addition of CO2 to plasticise<br>
polymeric material and highly efficient stirring to ensure homogeneous<br>
incorporation of particulate material throughout the polymer.<br>
This and other work from the same authors has shown high uniformity.<br>
However there is a need for further improved uniformity for both high and low<br>
loading levels, with milder processing conditions. Therapeutic concentrations<br>
of growth factors and other biotechnology drugs are of the order of ppb, whilst<br>
those of biocompatibilisers such as hydroxyapatite are of the order of 80 wt%.<br>
Greater uniformity manifests itself in more uniform prolonged release, and<br>
stronger monolithic structures.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that controlled internal distribution of matter<br>
within a polymer composite can be achieved in a simple and reproducible<br>
process, which enables the accurate and efficient handling of biologically active<br>
molecules in small or large amount in solution while retaining the manifold<br>
advantages of SCF processing. The present invention provides deposition of<br>
matter on a polymer surface in a first stage and internal distribution and optional<br>
pore formation in a second polymer plasticisation stage. This is in contrast to<br>
WO 91/09079 which teaches dissolving polymer and emulsifying with<br>
impregnation matter in a first stage, and plasticising in a second stage.<br>
Accordingly in the broadest aspect of the invention there is provided a process<br>
for the preparation of a polymer composite comprising internally distributed<br>
deposition matter wherein the process comprises providing a deposit of<br>
deposition matter at the surface of a solid state polymer substrate, contacting the<br>
surface deposited polymer with a plasticising fluid, or a mixture of plasticising<br><br>
fluids under plasticising conditions to plasticise and/or swell the polymer and<br>
internally distribute deposition matter, and releasing the plasticising fluid or<br>
fluids to obtain polymer composite.<br>
Preferably the process comprises providing a deposit at the surface of a high<br>
surface area polymer substrate, more preferably a powder bed or a high porosity<br>
matrix. Preferably the process provides a deposition layer of deposition matter<br>
on the internal and external surfaces of the polymer substrate, more preferably<br>
any exposed surfaces, including any exposed surface pores. By this means a<br>
more dilute deposit is formed which is of greater uniformity than depositing the<br>
same quantity of material on a smaller surface area. Deposition may be over the<br>
entire surface area or only part or parts thereof.<br>
Preferably a porous solid state polymer substrate is obtained by contacting<br>
polymer with plasticising fluid and subsequently releasing fluid in suitable<br>
manner to foam the polymer as is known in the art. In a preferred embodiment<br>
therefore the process comprises in a first stage contacting polymer with<br>
plasticising fluid or a mixture of plasticising fluids under plasticising conditions<br>
to plasticise the polymer, and releasing the fluid to obtain a solid state substrate<br>
polymer; in a second stage providing a surface deposit of deposition matter at<br>
the surface of the polymer, and in a third stage contacting the surface deposited<br>
polymer with a plasticising fluid or a mixture of plasticising fluids under<br>
plasticising conditions to plasticise and/or swell the polymer and internally<br>
distribute deposition matter, and releasing the plasticising fluid or fluids to<br>
obtain polymer composite. Preferably in the first stage the plasticising and<br>
releasing the fluid(s) is in manner to foam the polymer and obtain a porous solid<br>
state substrate polymer, for use in the second stage.<br><br>
The product composite may be porous or non-porous, even if obtained from a<br>
porous substrate. It is a particular advantage that porosity may serve to facilitate<br>
surface deposition, but be of little interest in the product composite or vice versa<br>
or a combination thereof.<br>
Deposition may be of discrete particles or of dissolved deposition matter and<br>
may be by solid or fluid phase deposition. Preferably deposition matter is<br>
provided in fluid phase, and deposition comprises immersion., spraying and the<br>
like with a solution, dispersion or suspension of deposition matter and drying<br>
by freezing, evaporation, heating, blotting etc.<br>
Alternatively deposition matter is provided in solid phase and deposition<br>
comprises powder coating, dusting, rolling or adhering.<br>
Deposition may be aided by softening or adhesion of surface polymer, in<br>
particularly in the case of deposition of insoluble or dry phase deposition matter.<br>
Deposition may be with or without physical interaction with the polymer<br>
surface. In a particularly preferred embodiment, on contacting polymer substrate<br>
with a solution, dispersion or suspension of deposition matter, the deposition<br>
matter adsorbs from liquid phase onto the polymer surface and forms an<br>
adsorption layer of deposition matter at desired levels. This layer remains intact<br>
to solvent and impact effects and the like, for example if subsequently surface<br>
washed with liquids.<br>
Immersion time may be of the order 1 second up to 48 hours, depending on the<br><br>
materials used. Drying time may be up to 48 hours depending on sensitivity to<br>
extreme heat or freezing or the like.<br>
Preferably deposition matter is provided in particulate or powder form and may<br>
be of particle size in the range up to 1mm, preferably 50 - 1000 micron.<br>
Deposition matter may be of uniform or mixed particle size, depending on<br>
practical constraints and the required distribution, and may be of same or<br>
different matter.<br>
The polymer is suitably in the solid phase or is a highly viscous fluid and may<br>
present limited or good mixing characteristics. Solid phase polymer may be<br>
particulate, eg in the form of granules, pellets, microspheres, powder, or<br>
monolithic eg matrix form. Plasticising conditions comprise conditions of<br>
reduced viscosity to plasticise and/or swell the polymer. It is known that<br>
particulate polymer agglomerates on plasticisation to a larger structure. This<br>
may revert to a particulate composite or form a monolithic composite on release<br>
of plasticising fluid, as hereinbelow defined. Polymer volumes of 5 or 10 mg<br>
or g up to multi kg scale may be used.<br>
Reference herein to a plasticising fluid is to a fluid which is able to plasticise<br>
polymer in its natural state or in supercritical, near critical, dense phase or<br>
subcritical state. Fluid may be liquid or gaseous, and is preferably selected for<br>
a suitable density which is capable of plasticising a given polymer, fluid density<br>
may be in the range 0.001 g/ml up to 10 g/ml for example 0.001 g/ml up to 2<br>
g/ml.<br>
Plasticising conditions comprises elevated or ambient temperature, and/or<br><br>
elevated or ambient pressure. Fluid may be selected for effective plasticisation<br>
of a given polymer under conditions which are amenable to the deposition<br>
matter or alternatively fluid is selected by preferred chemical type and suitable<br>
plasticising conditions are chosen for that fluid, preferably selecting a first<br>
amenable condition (T) and compensating with second condition (P) to obtain<br>
desired density.<br>
Preferably the plasticising conditions comprise a desired temperature less than,<br>
equal to or greater than the fluids critical temperature (Tc) in the range -200°C<br>
to +500°C, preferably -200°C to 200°C, more preferably -100 to +100°C, for<br>
example -80 or -20°C to +200 or +100°C. For most fluids this will be in the<br>
range approximately 10 to 15°C, 15 to 25°C, 25 to 30°C, 30 to 35°C, 35 to 45°C<br>
or 45 to 55°C, most preferably approximately 28 to 33°C (CO2). Other sub<br>
ranges may be envisaged and are within the scope of the invention. Preferably<br>
the lowest temperature is employed which is compatible with sufficient<br>
lowering of the polymer Tg to achieve plasticisation. To operate at ambient<br>
temperature, the process of the invention may require compensation by increase<br>
in pressure.<br>
Preferably the plasticising fluid comprises a desired pressure less than, equal to<br>
or greater than the plasticising fluids critical pressure (Pc) from in excess of 1<br>
bar to 10000 bar, preferably 1 to 1000, more preferably 2 to 800 bar, more<br>
preferably 2 to 400 bar, more preferably 5 to 265 bar, most preferably 15 to 75<br>
bar. For most fluids this will be in the range approximately 30 to 40 bar, 40 to<br>
50 bar, 50 to 60 bar, 60 to 75 bar or 80 to 215 bar, and is most preferably<br>
approximately 34 to 75 bar for dense phase or supercritical CO2. Other sub<br>
ranges may be envisaged and are within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
Fluid may be provided at plasticising conditions prior to contacting with<br>
polymer and deposition matter or may be brought to plasticising conditions in<br>
contact with surface deposited polymer.<br>
Preferably the process is carried out for a contact time of surface deposited<br>
polymer and plasticising fluid of 1 millisecond up to 5 hours. Short contact time<br>
may be preferred for example 2 milliseconds up to 10 minutes, more preferably<br>
20 milliseconds to 5 minutes, more preferably 1 second to 1 minute, more<br>
preferably 2 to 30 seconds, most preferably 2 to 15 seconds. Alternatively long<br>
contact time minimises detrimental effects of pressurising the vessel, and allows<br>
superior distribution, for example 15 minutes to 2 hours, preferably 15 minutes<br>
to 40 minutes or 30 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
Pressurising plasticising fluid may be in situ, or ex situ prior to contacting with<br>
surface deposited polymer as hereinbefore defined. The pressurisation period<br>
whereby in the case of in situ or ex situ pressurisation the fluid is pressurised or<br>
is introduced to the surface deposited polymer, is suitably for a period of 1<br>
second to 3 minutes, more preferably from 1 second to 1 minute, more<br>
preferably from 1 to 45 seconds.<br>
The process may be carried out with or without stirring or blending. Blending<br>
and conditions may be selected to assist plasticisation or according to the<br>
desired uniformity and distribution of loading. In the case that uniform<br>
distribution is required the process preferably comprises blending for prolonged<br>
period and/or high intensity. In the case that non-uniform distribution is<br>
envisaged, the process may be carried out simply with stirring.<br><br>
Blending may be by physical mixing, pumping, agitation for example with<br>
aeration or fluidising gas flow, lamellar flow or otherwise impregnation or<br>
diffusion of plasticising fluid throughout the surface deposited polymer.<br>
Stirring is typically with use of stirrers and impellers, preferably helical<br>
impellers such as helical ribbon impellers for enhanced blending and the like.<br>
Blending may be for a period of 1 millisecond up to 5 hours and may be for the<br>
duration of contacting with plasticising fluid or otherwise. Preferably stirring<br>
or blending is for substantially the duration of contacting with plasticising fluid,<br>
with period of stirring or blending corresponding to period of plasticising fluid<br>
contacting as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The process comprises subsequently releasing the plasticising fluid. In the case<br>
that plasticising conditions comprises elevated pressure release is under reduced<br>
pressure conditions, conducted over a desired depressurisation period, whereby<br>
the polymer composite is obtained comprising internally distributed deposition<br>
matter. Depressurisation may be achieved in situ, by depressurising a pressure<br>
vessel in which the process is carried out, whereby a monolithic block of<br>
polymer composite is obtained. Alternatively the contents of a pressure vessel<br>
in which the process is conducted may be discharged into a second pressure<br>
vessel at lower pressure whereby a homogeneous powder of polymer composite<br>
as hereinbefore defined is obtained by known means.<br>
Release of fluid may be in manner to foam the polymer substrate and create a<br>
porous structure, with deposition matter distributed throughout the polymer<br>
matrix and internal pore surface. Typically this is achieved by rapid release over<br><br>
a period of up to 2 minutes.<br>
Depressurisation period may be selected to foam the polymer if desired, and<br>
therefore determines the porosity of composite. Transition is preferably rapid<br>
over a period of from 1 ms to 10 minutes, preferably from 1 second to 3<br>
minutes, more preferably from 1 to 3 seconds for high porosity polymer.<br>
Alternatively plasticising fluid may be released in manner to allow fluid<br>
diffusion out of the polymer, avoiding foaming, to create a non-porous<br>
structure. Typically this is achieved by prolonged gradual release of fluid over<br>
a period of in excess of 10 minutes up to 12 hours. Preferably transition is to<br>
near ambient pressure i.e. substantially 1 arm (101.325 kPa).<br>
The process may be carried out in the presence or absence of additional solvents<br>
or fluids. In the case of physical interaction of deposition matter with the<br>
polymer surface additional solvents or fluids may be used without affecting the<br>
uniform deposition layer. Preferably however the process is carried out in the<br>
absence of solvent capable of dissolving the deposition matter. Suitable carriers,<br>
agents, preservation agents and the like may be employed as desired.<br>
A plasticising fluid as hereinbefore defined may comprise any fluid which is<br>
capable of plasticising a desired polymer. As is known in the art such fluids may<br>
be subjected to conditions of elevated temperature and pressure increasing<br>
density thereof up to and beyond a critical point at which the equilibrium line<br>
between liquid and vapour regions disappears. Supercritical and dense phase<br>
fluids are characterised by properties which are both gas like and liquid like.<br>
In particular, the fluid density and solubility properties resemble those of<br>
liquids, whilst the viscosity, surface tension and fluid diffusion rate in any<br><br>
medium resemble those of a gas, giving gas like penetration of the medium.<br>
Preferred plasticising fluids include carbon dioxide, di-nitrogen oxide, carbon<br>
disulphide, aliphatic C2-10 hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane,<br>
pentane, hexane, ethylene, and halogenated derivatives thereof such as for<br>
example carbon tetrafluoride or chloride and carbon monochloride trifluoride,<br>
and fluoroform or chloroform, C6-10 aromatics such as benzene, toluene and<br>
xylene, C1-3 alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, sulphur halides such as<br>
sulphur hexafluoride, ammonia, xenon, krypton and the like, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Typically these fluids may be brought into plasticising conditions at<br>
temperature of between -200°C to + 500°C and pressures of in excess of 1 bar<br>
to 10000 bar, as hereinbefore defined. It will be appreciated that the choice of<br>
fluid may be made according to its properties, for example diffusion and<br>
polymer plasticisation. Preferably the fluid acts as solvent for residual<br>
components of a polymer composite as hereinbefore defined but not for polymer<br>
or deposition matter as hereinbefore defined. Choice of fluid may also be made<br>
with regard to critical conditions which facilitate the commercial preparation of<br>
the polymer as hereinbefore defined. Supercritical conditions are shown of some<br>
fluids in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Preferably the plasticising fluid comprises carbon dioxide optionally in<br>
admixture with any further fluids as hereinbefore defined or mixed with<br>
conventional solvents, so-called "modifiers". CO2 is generally approved by<br>
regulatory bodies for medical applications, is chemically inert, leaves no residue<br>
and is freely available.<br>
The plasticising fluid may be present in any effective amount with respect to the<br>
polymer. Preferably the plasticising fluid is provided at a desired concentration<br>
in the reaction vessel to give a desired plasticisation and/or swelling of polymer.<br>
Such range may be from 1% to 200% of the polymer weight, e.g. with<br><br>
plasticising fluid in sufficient excess to achieve 10% to 40% absorption with<br>
respect to polymer weight.<br>
The deposition matter may be present in any effective amount with respect to<br>
polymer. Typical values are therefore 1 x 10-12 wt % to 99.9 wt%, preferably<br>
0.01 or 0.1 to 99.0 wt%, more preferably greater than 0.5 wt% or 1.0 wt% up<br>
to 50 wt%. In a particularly preferred embodiment therefore the process is<br>
carried out in low volumes of the order of picogram and nanogram levels with<br>
respect to 5g amounts of polymer. For example, presented as concentration of<br>
deposition matter on polymer, low volumes in the range 1x101 to 1x103 ng/mg<br>
may be present, for example 50 to 150 ng/mg. This is beneficial for most<br>
biologically active molecules such as enzymes or protein molecules because<br>
their therapeutic concentrations are very low. For example: the therapeutic<br>
amount of the growth factor HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) required to<br>
provide a therapeutic response in liver cells during liver regeneration process<br>
in tissue engineering is 10 ng/ml ((Tsubouchi, Niitani et al. 1991).<br>
The deposition matter may be selected from any desired matter adapted to<br>
perform a function on a desired biolocus comprising or otherwise associated<br>
with living matter, and which may be bioactive, bioinert, biocidal or the like;<br>
and non-biofunctional material including dyes, additives and the like.<br>
Preferably deposition matter is selected from a component, or precursor,<br>
derivative or analogue thereof, of a host structure into which implantation or<br>
incorporation is desired and preferably comprises matter intended for growth or<br>
repair, shielding, protection, modification or modelling of a human, animal,<br>
plant or other living host structure for example the skeleton, organs, dental<br><br>
structure and the like; to combat antagonists; for metabolism of poisons, toxins,<br>
waste and the like or for synthesis of useful products by natural processes, for<br>
bioremediation, biosynthesis, biocatalysis or the like.<br>
More specifically the deposition material includes but is not limited to the<br>
following examples typically classed as (pharmaceutical) drugs and veterinary<br>
products; agrochemicals as pest and plant growth control agents; human and<br>
animal health products; human and animal growth promoting, structural, or<br>
cosmetic products including products intended for growth or repair or modelling<br>
of the skeleton, organs, dental structure and the like; absorbent biodeposition<br>
materials for poisons, toxins and the like.<br>
Pharmaceuticals and veterinary products, i.e. drugs, may be defined as any<br>
pharmacologically active compounds that alter physiological processes with the<br>
aim of treating, preventing, curing, mitigating or diagnosing a disease.<br>
Drugs may be composed of inorganic or organic molecules, peptides, proteins,<br>
enzymes, oligosaccharides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and the like.<br>

components adapted for incorporation as implants into meniscus, cartilage,<br>
tissue and the like and preferably promote growth, modelling, enhancing or<br>
reinforcing of collagen, fibroblasts and other natural components of these host<br>
structures.<br>
Absorbent deposition matter for poisons, toxins and the like may be defined as<br>
any natural or synthetic products capable of immobilising by absorption,<br>
interaction, reaction or otherwise of naturally occurring or artificially introduced<br>
poisons or toxins.<br>
The deposition matter may be in any desired form suited for the function to be<br>
performed, for example in solid, semi-solid such as thixotrope or gel form,<br>
semi-fluid or fluid such as paste or liquid form, and may be miscible or<br>
immiscible but is insoluble in the polymer and plasticising fluid, eg as a<br>
suspension. It may be convenient to adapt the deposition matter form to render<br>
it in preferred form for processing and the function to be performed. The matter<br><br>
is preferably in the form of solid particles having particle size selected<br>
according to the desired application. Preferably particle size is of similar or of<br>
lesser order to that of the polymer composite, and optionally of any pores,<br>
preferably 10-9m - 10-2, for example of the order of picometers, nanometers,<br>
micrometers, millimetres or centimetres.<br>
The polymer composite may be in desired form suitable for the hereinbefore<br>
mentioned uses. For application to living matter, the polymer composite may<br>
be introduced as a dry or wet spray, powder, pellets, granules, monoliths and the<br>
like, comprising the deposition material substrate in releasable manner by<br>
dissolution, evaporation or the like, for example in the hereinbefore defined<br>
agrochemical, insecticidal and the like uses. For administration as a healthcare,<br>
pharmaceutical or the like composition to the human or animal body, the<br>
composition may be suitably formulated according to conventional practices.<br>
For use as pharmaceutical and veterinary products fabricated using the inventive<br>
process composites may be in the form of creams, gels, syrups, pastes, sprays,<br>
solutions, suspensions, powders, microparticles, granules, pills, capsules,<br>
tablets, pellets, suppositories, pessaries, colloidal matrices, monoliths and<br>
boluses and the like, for administration by topical, oral, rectal, parenteral,<br>
epicutaneous, mucosal, intravenous, intramuscular, intrarespiratory or like.<br>
The composite may be non porous or porous, and may comprise open or closed<br>
cell pores. Composite obtained with a very open porous structure, known as<br>
microcellular, is ideal for prolonged or staged release, for pharmaceutical and<br>
animal health etc applications as hereinbefore defined, also for biomedical and<br>
biocatalytic applications for example supporting growth of blood vessels and<br><br>
collagen fibres throughout the matrix, and forming structures resembling bone,<br>
meniscus, cartilage, tissue and the like, and providing a structure for throughput<br>
of substrate for biocatalysis and bioremediation and the like.<br>
Non-porous, open or closed cell composite may be useful for biodegradable<br>
staged or prolonged release delivery applications of deposition matter not<br>
requiring leaching in or out or other access. Release may be in vitro or in vivo<br>
and by parenteral, oral, intravenous, application or surgical for release proximal<br>
to the treatment locus, eg in tissue tumor treatment, or hyperthermic bone tumor<br>
treatment.<br>
A porous polymer composite may be obtained with uniform or varied porosity,<br>
preferably provides pores of at least two different orders of magnitude, for<br>
example of micro and macro type, each present in an amount of between 1 and<br>
99% of the total void fraction of the polymer composite.<br>
Reference herein to micro and macro pores is therefore to be understood to be<br>
respectively pores of any unit dimension and its corresponding 10n multiple.<br>
For example micro pores may be of the order of 10-(10-7)m with respective<br>
macro pores of the order of 10-(7-5)m, preferably 10-(8-7)m and 10-(6-5)m<br>
respectively, more preferably of micron and 102 micron order, for example 50<br>
to 200 micron. The pores may be of any desired configuration. Preferably the<br>
pores form a network of tortuous interlinking channels, more preferably wherein<br>
the micro pores interlink between the macro pores.<br>
Deposition matter may be distributed throughout relatively smaller and<br>
relatively larger pores or confined to larger pores. Deposition matter may be<br><br>
embedded in the walls of pores or may be freely supported but not encased in<br>
polymer matrix.<br>
An open cell structure may create a channel structure throughout the polymer<br>
composite, for leaching in and out of fluids for prolonged release, or for supply<br>
and removal of materials, in particular fluids and release matter. Different<br>
particle size deposition matter may selectively distribute between smaller and<br>
larger pores.<br>
A composite created in this maimer may enhance the biomechanical properties<br>
of the polymer, in contrast to that of known polymers comprising<br>
inhomogeneous distribution and large aggregates of inorganic materials.<br>
The process may be controlled in manner to determine the dimensions and void<br>
fraction of micro and macro pores and the morphology of the final product. The<br>
period for plasticising fluid release determines in part the level of porosity.<br>
Additionally the difference in pressure is proportional to porosity. Also a higher<br>
critical temperature confers a higher porosity. The composite is suitably<br>
obtained with porosity of 15% to 75% or greater, preferably 50% up to 97%.<br>
Suitably the polymer retains its solid or highly viscous fluid form subsequent<br>
to release of plasticising fluid, in order to retain the porous structure induced by<br>
the fluid.<br>
Further processing of the polymer, for example additional extraction with super<br>
critical fluid as known in the art or with other extractants, post-polymerisation<br>
and cross-linking, may be subsequently performed as required and as known in<br><br>
the art.<br>
The polymer may be selected from any known polymer, (block) copolymer,<br>
mixtures and blends thereof which may be crosslinked or otherwise, which is<br>
suited for introduction into or association with the human or animal body, plants<br>
or other living matter, or in vitro, or for use in the environment in non-toxic<br>
manner. Suitable polymer materials are selected from synthetic biodegradable<br>
polymers as disclosed in "Polymeric Biomaterials" ed. Severian Dumitriu, ISBN<br>

Preferably the polymer is selected from homopolymers, block and random<br>
copolymers, polymeric blends and composites of monomers which may be<br>
straight chain, (hyper) branched or cross-linked.<br>
Polymer may be of any molecular weight for the desired application, and is<br>
suitably in the range of from 1 to 1,000,000 repeat units. Higher molecular<br>
weight may be useful for longer release patterns or slower degradation.<br>
Polymers may include but are not limited to the following which are given as<br>
illustration only.<br>

monomer or lactic acid as the principal monomer with glycolic acid as the<br>
comonomer. The latter are termed poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymers;<br>
particularly suitable are polymers prepared from lactic acid alone, glycolic acid<br>
alone, or lactic acid and glycolic acid wherein the glycolic acid is present as a<br>
comonomer in a molar ratio of 100:0 to 40:60;<br>

described by Tamada and Langer in Journal of Biomaterials Science- Polymer<br>
Edition, 3, 315-353,1992 and by Domb in Chapter 8 of the Handbook of<br><br>
Biodegradable Polymers, ed. Domb A.J. and Wiseman R.M., Harwood<br>
Academic Publishers;<br>
Poly(amino acids); polyacetals; polyketals; polyorthoesters;<br>

Polyphosphazenes including derivatives of poly[(dichloro) phosphazene],<br>
poly[(organo) phosphazenes], polymers described by Schacht in Biotechnology<br>
and Bioengineering, 52, 102-108, 1996; and<br>
Azo polymers<br>
Including those described by Lloyd in International Journal of Pharmaceutics,<br>
106,255-260,1994.<br>
Synthetic Non-biodegradable Polymers may be selected from:<br>
Vinyl polymers including polyethylene, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate),<br>
polypropylene, poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(vinyl alcohol) and<br>
copolymers of vinyl alcohol and. vinyl acetate, poly(acrylic acid)<br>

Preferably a non biodegradable polymer is selected from polymers such as ester<br>
urethanes or epoxy, bis-maleimides, methacrylates such as methyl or glycidyl<br>
methacrylate, tri-methylene carbonate, di-methylene tri-methylene carbonate;<br>
biodegradable synthetic polymers such as glycolic acid, glycolide, lactic acid,<br>
lactide, p-dioxanone, dioxepanone, alkylene oxalates and caprolactones such as<br>
gamma-caprolactone.<br>
Polymer substrate may be obtained from its precursors in the process of the<br>
invention. The precursors may react to form the polymer substrate(s) in situ<br>
during or subsequent to plasticising fluid processing.<br>
The polymer may comprise any additional polymeric components having<br>
performance enhancing or controlling effect, for example determining the<br>
degree and nature of cross-linking for desired degradation, release, or fluid<br>
access, fiexural and general mechanical properties, electrical properties and the<br>
like.<br>
Additional components which may be incorporated during the manufacture of<br>
the polymer composite, for example other active agents, initiators, accelerators,<br>
hardeners, stabilisers, antioxidants, adhesion promoters, fillers and the like may<br><br>
be incorporated within the polymer. Additional materials(s) may be mixed with<br>
the polymer before or after contacting with deposition matter, or may be<br>
introduced by subsequent soaking or impregnation of the product composite<br>
having internally distributed deposition matter.<br>
If it is desired to introduce an adhesion promoter into the polymer composite,<br>
the promoter may be used to impregnate or coat particles of deposition matter<br>
prior to introduction into the polymer composite, by means of simple mixing,<br>
spraying or other known coating steps, in the presence or absence of fluid as<br>
hereinbefore defined. Preferably coating is performed in conjunction with<br>
mixing with fluid as hereinbefore defined whereby excellent coating is obtained.<br>
For example the adhesion promoter is dissolved in fluid as hereinbefore defined<br>
and the solution is contacted with particles of deposition matter as hereinbefore<br>
defined. Alternatively the adhesion promoter is introduced into the autoclave<br>
during the mixing and/or polymerisation step whereby it attaches to particles<br>
of deposition matter in desired maimer.<br>
Preferably the total amount of fillers including the deposition matter lies in the<br>
region of 0.01-99.9 wt %, preferably 0.1-99 wt%, more preferably in excess of<br>
50 or 60 wt%, up to for example 70 or 80 wt %.<br>
In some cases it may be desirable to introduce an initiator or accelerator to<br>
initiate (partial) curing prior to and/or subsequent to release of fluid, and<br>
initiation may be simultaneous with introduction or may be delayed, activated<br>
by increase in temperature. Alternatively a spray drying step may be employed<br>
in place of the curing step prior to or simultaneously with release of the fluid.<br>
In this case a post-curing may be employed. This may have advantages in terms<br><br>
of ease of manufacturing and simplicity of apparatus employed.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a polymer composite<br>
obtained with the process of the invention as hereinbefore defined.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a polymer composite<br>
comprising a porous or non porous polymer throughout which particulate<br>
deposition matter as hereinbefore defined is distributed with desired uniformity,<br>
preferably with high uniformity in excess of 80% for example in excess of 9S%.<br>
In a particular advantage the composite comprises exceedingly low levels of<br>
deposition matter of the order of picograms or nanograms per 5 g polymer, or<br>
presented as concentration of deposition matter on polymer, in low volumes in<br>
the range 1x101 to 1x103 ng/mg at excellent levels of uniformity and batch<br>
reproducibility, and/or of very low particle size of the order of 10 microns, 1<br>
micron or 0.1 microns.<br>
In a further advantage, contrasted with other methods of encapsulating (e.g.<br>
double emulsion) and introducing biological material which give rise to<br>
relatively large particles which give an uneven release with time, the process of<br>
the present invention enables internally distributing very small particles of<br>
deposition matter thus giving a much even release profile (reduced burst phase<br>
effect). Moreover the composite of the invention has been found to give release<br>
over a period of several months, and this is in contrast to the corresponding<br>
surface deposited polymer which may lose its surface deposit over the course<br>
of days.<br>
The composite of the invention may be distinguished from prior art: composite<br><br>
prepared by simple impregnation techniques and those of WO 91/09079 which<br>
show agglomeration of impregnation matter etc.<br>
Advantageously it has been found that very low and veiy high loading may be<br>
obtained according to the process of the present invention, which is not possible<br>
with known processes, by virtue of the uniform morphology of polymer and<br>
deposition matter, and loadings of deposition matter in the range from 1x10-<br>
12 - 99.9 wt %, for example in the region 1 x 10 -12 to 1 x 10 -9 wt %,<br>
midrange of from 20 to 50 wt% or in excess of 50 wt%, or in excess of 80 wt%<br>
may be obtained.<br>
The polymer composite may be in desired form suitable for the hereinbefore<br>
mentioned uses. Suitably the composite may be obtained in granular or<br>
monolith form and is preferably in monolith form for use as a scaffold or drug<br>
delivery device.<br>
For use as bioremediation, biocatalyst or biobarrier for human or animal or plant<br>
matter, the composite may be in a suitable shaped form or may be impregnated<br>
into a shaped product, to provide a barrier film, membrane, layer, clothing or<br>
sheet.<br>
For use as a structural component, for example comprising the polymer and<br>
optional additional synthetic or natural metal, plastic, carbon or glass fibre<br>
mesh, scrim, rod or like reinforcing for medical or surgical insertion, the<br>
composite may be adapted for dry or wet insertion into a desired host structure,<br>
for example may be in powder, pellet, granule or monolith form suited for<br>
insertion as a solid monolith into bone or tissue, as fillers or cements for wet<br><br>
insertion into bone or teeth or as solid aggregates or monoliths for orthopaedic<br>
implants such as pins, or dental implants such as crowns etc. Insertion may be<br>
by injection, surgical insertion and the like.<br>
The polymer composite may be of any desired particle size in the range of 0.1<br>
or 1 micron powders, preferably from 50 or 200 micron for use with larger<br>
particle size deposition matter up to monoliths of the order of 20 centimetres<br>
magnitude. It is a particular advantage of the present invention that the polymer<br>
composite is obtained in the desired form in uniform size particles such as<br>
powder, pellets and the like. Accordingly if it is desired to obtain a random or<br>
discrete distribution of particle size the polymer composite may be milled or<br>
may be blended from different size batches.<br>
Composite particle size may be controlled according to known techniques by<br>
controlled removal of plasticising fluid. If it is desired to obtain particulate<br>
composite, the process mixture is suitably removed from the mixing chamber<br>
under plasticising conditions into a separate container under ambient conditions<br>
through a nozzle or like orifice of desired aperture, and under desired difference<br>
of conditions and removal rate, adapted to provide the desired particle size.<br>
Spray drying apparatus and techniques may commonly be employed for the<br>
technique.<br>
If it is desired to obtain a polymer composite in the form of monoliths, the<br>
plasticising fluid is suitably removed using known techniques for foaming<br>
polymers. Accordingly the polymer mix is retained in the reaction vessel and<br>
conditions are changed from plasticising to ambient at a desired rate to cause<br>
removal of the fluid from the polymer mix. Depending on the nature of the<br><br>
polymer it is possible to obtain the monolith in porous foamed state if desired,<br>
having interconnecting pores and channels created by the removal of the<br>
plasticising fluid, simply by selecting a polymer consistency which is adapted<br>
to retain its foamed state.<br>
Monoliths may be formed into desired shape during the processing thereof, for<br>
example by removal of plasticising fluid from a mixing vessel, or from a mould<br>
internal to mixing vessel having the desired monolith shape. Alternatively<br>
monolith may be removed from the mixing vessel and cut to desired shape or<br>
transferred directly into a mould.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a scaffold comprising a<br>
polymer composite having internally distributed deposition matter as<br>
hereinbefore defined, suitably sized and shaped for a desired application as<br>
hereinbefore defined.<br>
A scaffold according to the invention is suitably in the form of a surgical<br>
implant, synthetic bone composite, organ module, biocatalyst for remediation<br>
or synthesis, or the like. The scaffold may be biodegradable or otherwise, for<br>
biodegradation in the body and ingrowth by native cells, or for biodegradation<br>
in the environment after completion of bioremediation avoiding in each case the<br>
need for subsequent operation to remove the polymer.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention mere is provided an apparatus for use in the<br>
preparation of a polymer composite as hereinbefore defined. Suitably the<br>
apparatus comprises one or more pressure vessels adapted for temperature and<br>
pressure elevation and comprising means for mixing the contents. The pressure<br><br>
vessel may include means for depressurisation or for discharging of contents<br>
into a second pressure vessel at lower pressure. The apparatus comprises means<br>
for introduction of polymer, deposition matter and plasticising fluid and any<br>
other materials whilst the vessel is pressurised, as commonly known in the art.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a polymer composite as<br>
hereinbefore defined or a scaffold thereof for use as a support or scaffold for<br>
drug delivery, for use in bioremediation, as a biocatalyst or biobarrier for human<br>
or animal or plant matter, for use as a structural component, for example<br>
comprising the polymer and optional additional synthetic or natural metal,<br>
plastic, carbon or glass fibre mesh, scrim, rod or like reinforcing for medical or<br>
surgical insertion, for insertion as a solid monolith into bone or tissue, as fillers<br>
or cements for wet insertion into bone or teeth or as solid aggregates or<br>
monoliths for orthopaedic implants such as pins, or dental implants such as<br>
crowns etc.<br>
The invention is now illustrated in non limiting manner with reference to the<br>
following examples and Figures wherein<br>
Figure 1 A - D shows scanning electron micrograph images of composites<br>
fabricated by the process of WO 98/51347 (Howdle et al) employed in the<br>
present invention; in Images A and B of an internal fracture surface of a<br>
monolith composite of calcium hydroxyapatite (40 wt%) and PLGA (60 wt%),<br>
at low magnification the distribution of calcium hydroxyapatite throughout the<br>
matrix and the production of pores is evident, at higher magnification the<br>
intimate mixing of guest particles and polymer is observed; in image C catalase<br>
(50% wt) is shown incorporated into a PLGA matrix (50%), micron scale pores<br><br>
in the polymer and the distinctive protein particle morphology are evident; in<br>
image D a high surface area microparticle composite (fluorescein (sodium salt)<br>
(8 wt%) and polycaprolactone (92 wt%)) are observed produced by direct<br>
atomisation, ie after fast depressurisation through an orifice.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show scanning electron micrograph images and corresponding<br>
mercury porosimetry data for PLA composites fabricated by the process of WO<br>
98/51347 (Howdle et at) employed in the present invention with control of<br>
PLA pore structure by changing de-pressurisation conditions; in Figure 2 the<br>
image shows presence of a small population of large pores obtained by de-<br>
pressurisation over a 2-hour period ("slow"); in Figure 3 the image shows an<br>
increase in porosity and a more heterogeneous distribution obtained by de-<br>
pressurisation over a 2-minute period ("fast"); data obtained by mercury<br>
porosimetry demonstrate that fine control over micropore distribution is<br>
achieved by changing only the de-pressurisation rate, with "slow"<br>
depressurisation creating pores in the 50 to 500 nm range, whilst "fast"<br>
depressurisation is strikingly different and creates pores in the 500 nm to 5 μm<br>
range<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic of the method of the invention in which fluorescent<br>
protein solution is adsorbed onto the polymer surface, the protein is confined to<br>
the surface and does not penetrate the bulk; confocal cross section through the<br>
polymer from the top surface shows protein confined to the edge and outer<br>
pores of the PLA scaffold; thereafter the polymer: protein complex is plasticised<br>
in CO2, the protein is shown distributed throughout the sample, and the<br>
resulting fluorescence is homogeneous with the protein redistributed from the<br>
surface to the bulk of the polymer<br><br>

Methods and Materials<br>
Cell culture<br>
Bone marrow samples (16 patients in total: 11 females and 5 males aged 14-83,<br>
with a mean age of 63.8 years) were obtained from patients undergoing routine<br>
total hip replacement surgery. Only tissue, which would have been discarded,<br>
was used with ethical approval. Human bone marrow cells were cultured on<br>
poly(-lactic acid) porous scaffolds encapsulated with and without recombinant<br>
human BMP-2 or PLA scaffolds adsorbed with rhBMP-2. In vitro assays<br>
included human bone marrow cells with or without addition of recombinant<br>
human BMP-2 (50ng/ml) in basal (10% aMEM) and osteogenic conditions<br>
(10% aMEM supplemented with 100μg/ml ascorbate and 10nM<br>
dexamethasone).<br>
Chorioallantoic membrane assay<br>
Fertilised eggs were incubated for 10-18 days using a Multihatch automatic<br>
incubator (Brinsea Products, Sandford, UK) at 37°C in a humidified<br>
atmosphere. Chick femurs were excised from day 18 chick embryos and a<br>
wedge-shaped segmental defect created in the middle of the femur, into which<br>
the scaffold construct was placed to fill the defect site. Chick bone and scaffolds<br>
(29 samples) were placed directly onto the CAM of 10-day-old eggs (through<br>
a 1cm2 square section cut into the shell) and incubation continued for a further<br>
7 days. The femoral/scaffold explant was then placed onto the CAM and<br>
incubation, at 37°C, continued for a further 7 days. Explants were then<br><br>
harvested and the chick embryo killed by decapitation. Prior to histochemical<br>
analysis, scaffold and explant samples were then fixed in 95% ethanol,<br>
processed to paraffin wax and 5μm sections prepared for histology.<br>

- 1.4) was ground to a fine grain size powder in a pestle and mortar.<br>
Alternatively, particles were produced by forcing the poly(DL-lactic acid) out<br>
of a vessel pressurized with CO2 through an orifice. The particles were<br>
retrieved from a cyclone collector, the CO2 may be repressurised and recycled.<br>
The methodology is based on the antisolvent technique of particle generation<br>
from supercritical suspension (PGSS).<br>
The polymer may also be prepared as a highly porous monolith using<br>
supercritical fluid processing. In this case porous scaffolds were prepared in<br>
moulds prepared from 48-well tissue culture plates (Costar, LISA). 12x100mg<br>
(±lmg) PLA were weighed out into the wells, and the mould was sealed inside<br>
the autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 35°C before filling with CO2 over<br>
a period of 30 minutes to a pressure of 207 Bar. This long filling time<br>
minimised the potentially detrimental effects of excessive Joule-Thompson<br>
heating on the biologically active substrate as the system was pressurised. The<br>
plasticising CO2-polymer mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes<br>
before venting to atmospheric pressure over 8 minutes. The pressure was<br>
controlled throughout the preparation using a JASCO BP-1580-81<br>
programmable backpressure regulator. The autoclave temperature remained<br><br>
below 38°C throughout the filling step, and the flow rate of CO2 during the<br>
equilibration step was 12cm3min-1. After the CO2 processing, the mould<br>
containing the foamed polymer was removed from the autoclave and the<br>
residual gas allowed to escape for 2 hours.<br>
Example 2 - Addition of the Biological Material - protein<br>
The protein, in this example avidin tagged with the fluorescent molecule<br>
rhodamine (Sigma), was dissolved in distilled water to give solutions at a<br>
concentration of 1 microgram and 10 microgram per ml in water). The liquid<br>
may alternatively be chosen from any liquid that dissolves the biological<br>
molecule but does not dissolve the polymer. 0.5cm3 aliquots of protein solution<br>
were pipetted onto approx 250mg samples of polymer material and remained<br>
in contact with the samples for a period of between 1 sec and 48 hours. During<br>
this exposure, a freeze drying process was used to remove the liquid. We have<br>
freeze-dried a range of avidin-rhodamine and ribonuclease solutions (1<br>
microgram - 250 mg/ml) onto both porous scaffolds and polymer powders for<br>
periods of up to 48 hours. Control scaffolds without any protein addition were<br>
prepared.<br>
Confocal fluorescence microscopy of this material confirmed that the avidin<br>
rhodamine was confined to the surface of the polymer material and was not<br>
distributed with the solid mass of the polymer (Figure 4).<br>
Example 3 -Re-distribution of the biological material - protein<br><br>
One scaffold from each protein concentration sample from Example 2, was<br>
removed from the well to act as control. The remaining examples were placed<br>
into a high pressure autoclave and heated to 35°C, replasticised in CO2 using<br>
the same procedure as Example 2 above. Figure 4 shows a schematic of the<br>
plasticising process. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of this re-processed<br>
material showed that the avidin rhodamine was re-distributed within the bulk<br>
of the polymer (Figure 4). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica<br>
TCS4D system with a Leica DMRBE upright fluorescence microscope and an<br>
argon-krypton laser. The red fluorescence of TRITC Avidin-Rhodamine was<br>
excited with the 568 nm laser line.<br>
Example 4 - Addition of biological material - enzyme<br>
To prove that the activity of biological material was unaffected by this<br>
treatment, 100 microlitres of 250 mg/ml of the enzyme ribonuclease A (Sigma)<br>
was adsorbed onto 8 batches of 100 mg poly(DL-lactic acid) powder using the<br>
method of the above Examples and freeze-dried for 48-hours.<br>
Example 5 - Redistribution of biological material - enzyme<br>
The powder of Example 4 was processed using the conditions in Example 3 to<br>
produce polymer foam composites.<br>
Example 6 — Evidence for Retention of Activity<br>
The ribonuclease enzyme was released from the foams obtained in Example 5<br>
in a Tris buffer (pH 7.13) at physiological temperatures. Using a specific<br><br>
ribonuclease substrate, cytidine-2':3'-monophospate, the recovery of activity<br>
was monitored by the conversion of the substrate to a form that could be<br>
detected by a UV spectrophotometer (Table 1). Full biological activity of the<br>
protein was retained.<br>
Results<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic of the supercritical fluid process. Concentration<br>
profiles of the fluorescent avidin-rhodamine complex are shown after the<br>
freeze-drying step and after plasticising CO2 reprocessing. Following the initial<br>
freeze-drying, fluorescence is localised at the exposed surfaces of the scaffold,<br>
i.e. the top surface and the walls of pores. After CO2 reprocessing, the complex<br>
is distributed throughout the sample, and the resulting fluorescence is<br>
homogeneous.<br>
The schematic is supported by data from confocal microscopy. On the left are<br>
eight images that follow the edge of a pore in a sample from the top surface to<br>
a depth of 77.4μm after the initial freeze-drying step. The images show a<br>
decreasing intensity of fluorescence as the distance from the top surface<br>
increases, except for a narrow region localised at the edge of the pore.<br>
The series on the right depicts a sample that has been reprocessed in plasticising<br>
CO2. Here again, the series follows the edge of a pore to a depth of 82.5μm<br>
below the surface. In contrast to the unprocessed scaffold, fluorescence is<br>
observed throughout the scaffold with appreciable intensity seen both in the<br>
bulk and at the pores' surface.<br><br>
Ribonuclease activity was measured after release into Tris buffer solution from<br>
scaffolds after processing in scCO2 (Figure 5). The rate of reaction of<br><br>
cytidine-2', 3'-monophosphate to cytidine-3 '-phosphate was measured by the<br>
change in absorbance at 284 nm. The black circles (samples) represent the<br>
activity of the enzyme compared to the standards (open circles). The mean<br>
recovery of activity was 100.8% (±9.8%) indicating that enzyme activity is<br>
retained throughout the process. The correlation between sample and standard<br>
activity is high (R2 = 0.9959;.<br>
Example 7 - Evidence of Controlled Release<br>
Figure 6 displays the protein release behaviour from Example 6 as a function<br>
of time. Where the protein has been dried onto the polymer scaffold without a<br><br>
second plasticising CO2 processing step, the protein is released very quickly<br>
with nothing remaining after two days (Black triangles). In samples which have<br>
been subjected to the SCF reprocessing step, the release is far more protracted.<br>
After an initial "burst" phase (0-1 days), the rate of release stabilises for<br>
approximately three weeks before degradation of the polymer matrix allows the<br>
protein to escape. The profile then follows a rectilinear relationship until the<br>
exhaustion of the protein after approximately 80 days.<br>
Example 8 - Addition of Biological Material - Growth Factor<br>
Scaffold generation and rhBMP-2 encapsulation<br>
Polymer obtained as in Example 1 was loaded with the Growth Factor<br>
recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Poly(DL-lactic<br>
acid) and rhBMP-2 (100ng/mg PLA) were mixed together using a combination<br>
of conventional solution and supercritical carbon dioxide processing to generate<br>
porous (50-200μm) scaffolds (23). Briefly, .Recombinant BMP-2 was adsorbed<br>
onto poly(D,L-lactic acid) powder (Alkermes Inc., USA; low inherent viscosity,<br>
Mw 84 kDa, polydispersity = 1.4) at a concentration of 100ng/mg polymer. The<br>
polymer:protein mixture was processed using a supercritical carbon dioxide<br>
pressurized to 207bar and heated to 35°C for 20 minutes in a high pressure<br>
vessel. Upon depressurization, the protein is encapsulated within the polymer<br>
and pores are formed in the polymer matrix by the escape of the carbon dioxide<br>
gas. Functionally active recombinant human BMP-2 was derived from E.Coli,<br>
at greater than 98% purity in a largely homogenous form.. In this procedure, the<br>
efficient processing of the liquefied polymer in scCO2 at near ambient<br>
temperatures results in a homogeneous distribution of the bioactive factor<br>
throughout the polymer matrix. These mild processing conditions allow the<br>
processing of growth factors that are heat or solvent sensitive without further<br><br>
degradation or damaging their biological activity.<br>
Example 9 - Cell growth in PLA<br>
Human bone marrow cell/ PLA constructs were cultured in 10% FCS aMEM<br>
supplemented with osteogenic medium containing 5 raM inorganic<br>
phosphate for the final 48 hours of the culture period and mineralization was<br>
detected by von Kossa staining.<br>
Histochemistry and immunocytochemistry<br>
Prior to histochemical analysis, PLA scaffold samples were fixed with 4%<br>
Paraformaldehyde or 95% ethanol, dependent on the staining protocol and, as<br>
appropriate, processed to paraffin wax and 5μm sections prepared. Negative<br>
controls were included in all studies, i) Alkaline phosphatase activity: Cultures<br>
stained using the Sigma alkaline phosphatase kit (no.85) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions; ii) Alcian blue/Sirius red: Samples were stained<br>
using Weigert's haematoxylin, 0.5% alcian blue (in 1% acetic acid) and sirius<br>
red (in saturated Picric acid).iii) Toluidine Blue and Von Kossa Staining:<br>
Samples were stained with 1% AgN03 under UV light for 20 minutes until<br>
black deposits were visible and after air drying, slides were counterstained with<br>
toluidine blue.<br>
C2C12 alkaline phosphatase assay<br>
BMP-2 has the ability to induce C2C12 promyoblast differentiation into the<br>
osteoblast lineage<br>
(33,34,35).<br>
After encapsulation of 0.01% (w/w) rhBMP-2<br>
within PLA scaffolds, the bioactivity of rhBMP-2 released from the polymer<br>
was determined using C2C12 cells. Briefly, human bone marrow stromal cells<br>
were cultured in the presence or absence of rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA<br><br>
scaffold, or passaged onto rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffold or PLA scaffold<br>
alone in 10% FCS DMEM at 37°C and 5% CO2 for three days. Samples were<br>
fixed in ethanol and stained for alkaline phosphatase.<br>
Bioactivity of rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffolds<br>
After encapsulation of rhBMP-2 within PLA scaffolds (100ng/mg PLA), the<br>
bioactivity of rhBMP-2 released from PLA scaffolds was determined using<br>
induction of the C2C12 promyoblast cell line into the osteogenic lineage as<br>
detected by alkaline phosphatase expression. Alkaline phosphatase-positive<br>
cells were observed following culture of C2C12 cells in presence of or on<br>
rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffolds (Fig. 1A, C). No induction of alkaline<br>
phosphatase-positive cells was observed using blank scaffolds (Fig. 1B, D). As<br>
expected, rhBMP-2 (50ng/ml) adsorbed on PLA promoted human bone marrow<br>
stromal cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation on PLA<br>
porous scaffold in vitro as observed by SEM, confocal microscopy and<br>
expression of type I collagen histochemistry (data not shown).<br>
Human osteoprogenitor growth on rhBMP-2 encapsulated scaffolds<br>
Following demonstration of the ability of using rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA<br>
scaffold to stimulate differentiation of C2C12 promyoblast towards the<br>
osteoblast lineage, the potential of rhBMP-2 scaffolds to induce differentiation<br>
and mineralisation of human bone marrow stromal cells was examined in vitro<br>
and in vivo.<br>
i) CAM culture<br>
Culture of human osteoprogenitors on rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffolds on<br>
the chick chorioallantoic membrane model showed that encapsulated rhBMP-2<br>
stimulated human bone marrow stromal cell growth and differentiation in the<br><br>
PLA scaffolds (Fig. 2B-D). Extensive angiogenesis, as evidenced by new blood<br>
vessel growth, was observed on the scaffold/cell constructs from the CAM to<br>
the implanted construct over a period of 7 days (Fig. 2A). New cartilage and<br>
bone were observed within the chick bone defect as detected by alcian blue and<br>
sirius red staining ( Fig 2B, C) and the use of polarized light microscopy to<br>
demonstrate collagen birefringence within the newly formed matrix (Fig. 2D).<br>
Subcutaneous implantation<br>
Confluent primary human bone marrow cells were trypsinised and seeded<br>
(2x105 cells/sample in serum free aMEM) onto PLA scaffolds adsorbed with<br>
rhBMP-2 or rhBMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffolds for 15 hours. Blank (PLA<br>
alone) scaffolds were set up in the absence of cells. After 15 hours, constructs<br>
were placed in osteogenic media for a further 3 days, prior to subcutaneous<br>
implantation into MF1-nu/nu mice (20-24g, 4-5 weeks old) as previously<br>
described(36). After 4-6 weeks, the mice were killed and specimens were<br>
collected and fixed in 95% ethanol for histochemical analysis.<br>
ii) Subcutaneous implant model<br>
Primary human bone marrow cells were seeded onto PLA scaffolds<br>
encapsulated with rhBMP-2 and subcutaneous implanted (8 samples) in nude<br>
mice for 6 weeks (PLA alone served as a negative control). Poor cell growth<br>
and negligible bone matrix synthesis was observed on PLA scaffolds alone (in<br>
the absence of rhBMP-2) implanted in nude mice with only fibrous tissue and<br>
adipose tissue observed (Fig. 3E). In contrast, rhBMP-2 encapsulated scaffolds<br>
promoted human bone marrow stromal cell adhesion, proliferation,<br>
differentiation with extensive evidence of new bone matrix deposition as<br><br>
detected by Alcian blue/Sirius red staining for cartilage and bone respectively<br>
(Fig. 3 A and 3B). Furthermore, evidence of organised new woven bone within<br>
the encapsulated constructs was confirmed by birefringence of collagen using<br>
polarized microscopy (Fig 3B). The efficacy of rhIBMP-2 to induce bone<br>
formation was confirmed by HBM cell in-growfh and bone matrix formation<br>
into rhBMP-2 adsorbed PLA scaffolds as detected by Alcian blue and Sirius red<br>
staining (Fig 3C) and (Fig 3D) Type I collagen staining. Only fibrous tissue and<br>
fat tissue were observed in blank (PLA alone) scaffolds (Fig 3E).<br>
Intra-peritoneal implantation<br>
The diffusion chamber (130ΜL capacity) model provides an enclosed<br>
environment within a host animal to study the osteogenic capacity of skeletally<br>
derived cell populations, which resolves the problems of host versus donor bone<br>
tissue generation. Cells were recovered by collagenase (Clostridium<br>
histolyticum, type IV; 25U/ml) and trypsin/EDTA digestion. Human bone<br>
marrow cells were sealed in diffusion chambers (2 x 106 cells/chamber)<br>
together with PLA porous scaffold encapsulated or adsorbed with or without<br>
rhBMP-2. Chambers were implanted intra-peritoneally in MF1-nu/nu mice and<br>
after 10 weeks the mice were killed, chambers were removed and examined by<br>
X-ray analysis prior to fixation in 95% ethanol at 4°C. Polymer samples were<br>
processed undecalcified and sectioned at 5 μm and stained for toluidine blue,<br>
type I collagen, osteocalcin and mineralisation by von Kossa.<br>
iii) Diffusion chamber model<br>
Recombinant human BMP-2 encapsulated PLA scaffolds seeded with human<br>
osteoprogenitor cells, showed morphologic evidence of new bone and cartilage<br>
matrix formation as examined by Alcian blue and Sirius red staining (Fig. 3G,<br><br>
3J) and by X-ray analysis (Fig. 31) after 10 weeks implantation within diffusion<br>
chambers. Metachromatic staining was observed using toluidine blue and<br>
collagen deposition and new matrix synthesis was confirmed by birefringence<br>
microscopy (Fig. 3H). Cartilage formation could be observed within rhBMP-2<br>
encapsulated PL A scaffolds confirming penetration of human osteoprogenitors<br>
through the scaffold constructs (Fig. 3J). No bone formation was observed on<br>
cell/PLA scaffold constructs alone (Fig. 3F).<br>
Further aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
foregoing.<br><br>
