				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:-<br>
The Invention describes Automated Meter Reader cum Control Unit (AMRCU): The Unit is to provide service to consumers of electrical energy, single or three phase, with remote reading, monitoring, tamper proofing, switching off and on facility individually or collectively in case of multiple consumers. The complete unit as referred in the enclosed drawing comprising of: -<br>
(1)	Terminal Block for incoming supply<br>
(2)	Electronic Energy Meter.<br>
(3)	Intelligent Control System having: -<br><br>
(a)	Relay Control Drive: - This facilitates switching off or on activity of the<br>
consumer load, on receipt of direction either form the operation of a limit<br>
switch by way of tampering or from the distribution system.<br>
(b)	Interface for Common Meter Reading Instrument (CMRI): - This enables<br>
the utility provider to download energy meter data by connecting hand<br>
held meter reader unit through serial port if need be.<br>
(c)	Interface for Global  System Mobile Communication (GSM) / Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Unit: - This is for connecting Modem<br>
for data transmission to and from main distribution system.<br>
(d)	Interface for Electronic Energy Meter: - This is to interact with the<br>
Energy Meter for collection of different parameters measured by the<br>
energy Meter.<br>
(e)	Interface for Limit Switch: - This is to monitor any unauthorised opening<br>
of system enclosure, thus provide full protection against any tampering of<br>
the system.<br>
(f)	Switch   Mode   Power   Supply   (SMPS):   -   The   combined   system   is<br>
connected to its own SMPS to cater to its power requirement.<br>
(4)   Global System Mobile Communication (GSM) / Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Modem with power supply.<br><br>
(5)	Antena<br>
(6)	Limit Switch to ensure consumer load safety and protection from un<br>
authorised opening of the enclosure.<br>
(7)	Latching Relay for switching OFF Or ON individual consumer load.<br>
(8)	Isolator circuit Breaker for protection.<br>
(9)	Terminal Block for consumer load.<br>
The system thus is capable to monitor load, based on the information received about loading pattern. The micro - controller based control unit is capable of switching off or on the individual consumer load with LATCHING RELAYS of suitable rating from the load monitoring stations of utility provider.<br>
The load for each consumer is routed through the Latching relay. The relay facilitates switching off - on as the case may be for the consumer as and when required by the utility provider, based on the power consumption pattern being monitored. Use of latching relay is to ensure proper connection of consumer load without any internal power consumption. These relays require power only to change the state i.e. either for switching on or off the consumer load. It remains in the same state unless it is again energized to change the prevailing state.<br>
The system is to monitor the energy consumption of individual consumer as per required time interval or on continuous basis and send the information to monitoring control station through the GSM / CDMA transreceiver as and when require. Based on the information received, the monitoring control station ensures necessary action, which is conveyed to the GSM / CDMA transreceiver. The instruction received by the measurement system GSM / CDMA transreceiver is transmitted to micro - controller based Relay Control unit. On receipt of the information the Relay Control Unit ensure necessary action to operate the corresponding Latching Relay for OFF - ON operation of the consumer load.<br><br>
PROBLEMS WITH PRIOR ART:-<br>
1.	At    present    Meter    reading,    monitoring,    Load    Connection    and<br>
disconnection can only be done after physically visiting the consumer<br>
premises.<br>
2.	Human movement from one place to another either for Meter reading,<br>
monitoring,   Load   Connection   or   disconnection   is   not   only   time<br>
consuming but also costly.<br>
3.	Many a time the meter reader faces problem of premises locked etc.for<br>
taking the reading.<br>
4.	In case of urgent need of mass scale Meter reading, monitoring, Load<br>
Connection or disconnection in a single day with the existing system, is<br>
virtually impossible or need huge manpower deployment vis - a vis<br>
excessive cost.<br>
5.	The present system is not suitable for monitoring at regular interval, in<br>
case of any particular need. The data thus collected manually is rather<br>
difficult to analyse for management purposes and timely action cannot be<br>
taken to monitor the same.<br>
6.	The  present   system  is   not  suitable   for  instantaneous   connection<br>
disconnection of load at consumer premises. Also in the present system,<br>
as all the action is to be done only on the physical movement of human at<br>
the consumer premises, it is costly.<br>
7.	In the present system, possibility of the Meter tampering cannot be traced<br>
easily without physical examination.<br>
8.	The present system is prone to human observation error also.<br><br>
