TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a medicament<br>
More specifically this invention relates to an anthelmintic preparation.<br>
More specifically this invention relates to the oral treatment of worms in equine species, such as horses and other animals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Anthelmintics are widely used in aqueous suspension formulations for the control of parasitic helminths, namely round worms (nematodes), tapeworms (cestodes), or flukes (trematodes).<br>
Anthelmintics have been used in a variety of animal species including sheep, cattle, goats, deer, horses, cats, dogs, llama, buffalo and poultry.<br>
Benzimidazole anthelmintic compounds are widely used in veterinary medicine. Common forms include oxfendazoie, mebendazole, fenbendazole, albendazole and the probenzimidazoles febantel and netobimin, which are metabolised to the active benzimidazole moiety within the animal.<br>
In general, benzimidazole compounds are sparingly soluble in aqueous solutions. Pour-on solutions utilizing these compounds for the treatment of parasitic helminths are well known, for example British Patent Specification No, 1527584 discloses a pour-on formulation. This is characterised in that the active compound is dissolved, emulsified or suspended in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture which is tolerable to the skin and applied with the aid of a suitable device, for example a measuring cup or spray bottle to the skin of the animal to be treated.  The active<br>
 <br>
ingredients disclosed are Tetramisole and Levamisole.<br>
The current applicant has previously developed a liquid pour on product making use of benzimidazole anthelmintics such as oxfendazole, thiabendazole, albendazole, cambendazole, fendendazoie, flubendazole, mebendazole, oxibendazole, parbendazoie, thiophanate, febantel and netobimin.<br>
Horses have a high work load and high energy requirements, and regular worming of horses is important. Untreated parasitic infestations can result in a number of health problems, including tail rubbing, colic, loss of condition, poor performance, coughing, anemia, diarrhoea, and in very extreme cases death.<br>
Worming horses can be a difficult exercise, despite the large number of worming products currently available and attempts to increase the palatability of products.<br>
For the treatment of horses, drenches pour-on products, granular products put into feed, and pastes have been used with varying success.<br>
Drenches have traditionally been administered to horses directly into the stomach through a tube that was inserted through the mouth into the proximal oesophagus. This method of administration, which is colloquially known as 'tubing', allows dosing of low strength high volume anthelmintics. This method also has the advantage that it maximizes the chances of the full dose of the drench being delivered to the site of action and/or the site of absorption. The major disadvantage is that this administration method usually has to be carried out by a vet due to the risk of administering the product via the trachea into the lung. This method also requires a reasonable level of co-operation from the horse and therefore administering an anthelmintic in this way can be extremely difficult in factious animals.<br>
 <br>
Pour-on products, granular products put into feed, and pastes also have significant disadvantages.  These are discussed in turn below.<br>
Pour-on solutions are not a preferred method of administration of worming formulations to horses. Pour-on solutions will often rub off on covers, when the horse rolls, or be consumed by other horses during grooming after administration. The use of pour-on formulations therefore requires isolation of the horse for a period of time after administration to ensure that the dosage has been absorbed.<br>
Granules, powders or pellets containing worming formulations can be mixed with a horse's feed. The significant disadvantage with this method is the requirement to ensure that the entire dosage has been eaten. Many horses will carefully separate their feed from the wormer, leaving the drug in the bottom of the feed container. This method also has significant problems if a number of horses are feed in the same area or paddock, as the varying appetite of the horses will result in unpredictable dosage.<br>
Alternatively wormers can be in the form of a paste which is administered orally using a syringe. Worming in this way can be difficult. The paste must be administered far enough to the back of the horses mouth/throat to ensure that it is swallowed and not spat out. This usually involves holding the horses tongue in one hand and administering the paste as far back in the mouth as possible. While this approach might be attractive in theory, much of the paste often ends up on the ground or person administering the dosage. This common loss of part (often a significant part) of the dosage decreases the accuracy with which the actual dosage administered can be determined, and also decreases the dose administered. Under dosing can commonly lead to a build up of resistance of a worm species to that particular active compound. This is highly undesirable.  It can<br>
 <br>
also be a time consuming and messy process. This method can also lead to injury of the person administering the dosage through unpredictable behavior of uncooperative animals.<br>
A further complicating factor is that some worm species have developed resistance to a number of commonly used worming drugs.<br>
The more frequently worms are exposed to the drug, the greater the chance of resistance developing.<br>
Treating or preventing worms in horses is not as simple as giving a dose of wormer which results in the host's helminth population being killed. Horses travel to different events and eat from different pastures in the presence of different horses with high frequency and are therefore exposed to a wide variety of parasites including different strains of the same species. Frequent worming is necessary and issues of drug resistant worms are critical.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a product which is easily administered  to  horses  or other equine  species,   and  overcomes  the  above<br>
mentioned problems.<br>

It is acknowledged that the term 'comprise' may, under varying jurisdictions, be attributed with either an exclusive or an inclusive meaning. For the purpose of this specification, and unless otherwise noted, the term 'comprise' shall have an inclusive meaning - i.e. that it will be taken to mean an inclusion of not only the listed components it directly references, but also other non-specified components or elements.

It is an object of the present invention to address the foregoing problems or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.<br>
Further aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the ensuing description which is given by way of example only.<br>
DISCLOSURE QF INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a medicament for oral administration to a subject, which includes<br>
at least one compound which is selected for its activity against strongyles,<br>
at least one macrocyclic lactone (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof),<br>
and<br>
praziquantel (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof),<br>
the medicament characterised in that the medicament is within a viscosity range that ensures that once administered orally the medicament spreads readily into the mouth of the subject.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament of the present invention may be used to  treat  parasitic  helminths,   namely  round  worms  (nematodes),   tapeworms<br>
 <br>
^cestodes), or flukes (trematodes), and shall be referred to as such herein. However, this should not be seen as limiting, as the active ingredients, or the combination used herein may also be active against other parasitic species, in this instance, these additional parasitic species should be considered to be covered by the present application.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may include at least three active ingredients.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compound which is selected for its activity against strongyles may be a benzimidazole compound (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof).<br>
In an alternative embodiment the compound which is selected for its activity against strongyles may be a tetrahydropyrimidine compound (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof).<br>
However, this should not be seen as limiting as any other compound which is active against strongyles, and which is compatible with the subject species may be utilised with the present invention. Another example of a compound which is active against strongyles is levamisole. Levamisole is toxic to equine species, and therefore would not be utilised when the medicament is prepared for equine use. However, levamisole could be utilised if the medicament was for use in another species, such as cattle, or camel.<br>
Therefore, in one preferred embodiment the medicament may include;<br>
at   least   one   anthlemintically   active    benzimidazole   compound   (or pharmaceutical equivalent thereof),<br>
at least one macrocyclic lactone compound (or pharmaceutical equivalent<br>
 <br>
thereof), and<br>
praziquantel (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof).<br>
in an alternative embodiment the medicament may include:<br>
at  least  one  anthlemintically  active  tetrahydropyrimidine  compound  (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof)<br>
at least one macrocyciic lactone compound (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof), and<br>
praziquantel (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof).<br>
One skilled in the art would however realise that the above combinations are not limiting, and that combinations including both a benzimidazole and tetrahydropyimidine compounds may be utilised with the present invention.<br>
One skilled in the art would also appreciate that the medicament may also include additional active ingredients in addition to the three anthetminitically active compounds selected from the classes above.<br>
It should be appreciated that each of the three classes of active components in the medicament act on different parasitic helminths, for example:<br>
•	Macrocyciic lactones are active against most parasitic helminth species,<br>
except tapeworms and some species of strongyles which have built up<br>
resistance to macrocyciic lactones, for example p. equorum.<br>
i	•     Praziquantel is active against tapeworms, and<br>
•	Compounds which are selected for their activity against strongyles, such as<br>
benzimidazole  or  tetrahydropyrimidine   are   active   against  species   of<br>
 <br>
strongyles which have  built up  resistance to  macrocyclic  lactone^, tor example p. equorum.<br>
The medicament of the present invention therefore covers and is active against a very wide spectrum of parasitic helminth species.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the anthelminticaiiy active benzimidazole compound may be oxfendazoie, and shall be referred to as such herein. However, this should not be seen as limiting, as any other suitable benzimidazole such as fenbendazole, mebendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole or any other benzimidazole with anthelmintic activity may be utilised with the present invention.<br>
Oxfendazoie is particularly preferred when the animal to be treated is an equine.<br>
Oxfendazoie is the sulfoxide form of fenbendazole, and is a broad spectrum benzimidazole anthelmintic used against roundworms, strongyles and pinworms. It is a white to grey powder; insoluble in water, slightly soluble in acetone, chloroform, ether and methanol. Its chemical designation is [5-(phenylsulfinyl)-lH-benzimidazol-2-yl] carbamic acid methyl ester.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the tetrahydropyrimidine compound may be morantel or pyrantel. However, this should not be seen as limiting, as any other suitable tetrahydropyrimidines with anthelmintic activity may be utilised with the present invention<br>
It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that	the replacement of a<br>
benzimidazole compound (or other active ingredient) with	a tetrahydropyrimidine<br>
compound  would   overcome   resistance,   if this  should	build   up   against  the<br>
benzimidazole compound.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment the macrocyclic lactone may be a milbemycin.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the macrocyclic lactone may be one of the following: ivermectin, abamectin or moxidectin.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the macrocyclic lactone may be abamectin, and shall be referred to as such herein. However, this should not be seen as limiting, as any other suitable macrocyclic lactone may be utilised with the present invention.<br>
Abamectin is a mixture of avermectins containing &gt; 80% avermectin B1a and 
In an alternative particularly preferred embodiment, the macrocyclic lactone may be moxidectin. Moxidectin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, being the 23-methyloxime analogue of the milbemycin nemadectin.<br>
Praziquantel is an antiparasitic (antihelmintic) medication which is used for the treatment of intestinal tapeworms,<br>
The active ingredients should be taken to include pharmaceutical equivalents thereof, which may include salts of, analogues of, or compounds having the same activity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the subject may be a non-human mammal.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the subject may be an equine mammal, including horses, ponies, donkeys, mules and asses.<br>
 <br>
V.<br>
However, this should not be seen as limiting as the medicament may also be used for other animals, including, but not limited to camels, cattle, sheep, goats and deer.<br>
In the case of a medicament including a benzimidazole, a macrocyclic lactone and praziquantel as the active ingredients, these may be present in the medicament in the following concentrations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient benzimidazole (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 0.1 io 50 % w/w of the<br>
medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient benzimidazole (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 18 to 22 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient benzimidazole (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 18.9 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient macrocyclic lactone (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 0.05 to 5.0 % w/w of the<br>
medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient abamectin (or a pharmaceutical )     equivalent thereof) may be approximately 0.36 to 0.46 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient abamectin (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 0.42 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient moxidextin (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 0.8 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient praziquantel may make up approximately 1 to 20 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the active ingredient praziquantel (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 4,5 to 5.5 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
in a preferred embodiment the active ingredient praziquantel (or a pharmaceutical equivalent thereof) may be approximately 5.1 % w/w of the medicament.<br>
It should be noted, that the ratio of the three active ingredients in the medicament may alter depending oty the target animal species for treatment. This ratio may take into account the most common parasitic species in the target animal species, the resistance of those species, and the route of metabolism of each of the active ingredients in the target animal species.<br>
One skilled in the art would realize, and readily be able to determine the desired concentrations of active ingredients when these differ from above.<br>
in  a  preferred  embodiment the medicament may also include  at least one )     preservative.<br>
In a preferred  embodiment the medicament may also  include  at least one<br>
thickener.<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may also include at least one dispersing and/or suspending agent.<br>
The following are given by way of example only, and one skilled in the art would be aware that other agents with the same or similar properties may be utilized in the<br>
present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may also include the following agents. The following approximate concentrations are given by way of example only:<br>
 <br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may also include at least one flavoring agent to increase the palatability of the medicament.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the flavoring may be apple flavor. This is especially palatable for equines. However, this should not be seen as limiting, as a number of flavorings may be utilized with the present invention, depending on the target<br>
 <br>
&gt; animal species for treatment, for example, peach or other fruit flavoring.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the apple flavoring may be present at an approximate concentration of 2% w/w.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may be administered orally, this may be via a syringe as in preferred embodiments the present invention is administered as a single dosage. Tubing on the other hand, is more suitable for presentation of multiple doses.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may be within the viscosity range of any of the following:<br>
•	Viscosity at 20 °C (Helipath spindle T-F at 0.6 rpm) - within the range of 100,000 to 800,000 cp<br>
•	Viscosity at 20 °C (Helipath spindle T-F at 6 rpm) - within the range of 20,000 to 150,000 cp<br>
•	Thixotropic Index (Helipath spindle T-F, 0.6rpm/6 rpm) - within the range of 1.0 to 8.0.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the pH of the medicament may be within the range of 5.5 to 6.5 at 20°C for a 10% aqueous solution. This is suitable to ensure the stability of abamectin, moxidectin, or other macrocyclic lactone.<br>
This viscosity range provides the following characteristics and advantages to the medicament of the present invention:<br>
•	The viscosity is sufficiently creamy to adhere to the inner surface of the<br>
subject's mouth or checks, including the buccal membrane.<br>
 <br>
This allows quick and easy absorption of the medicament both through the buccal membrane and through the gut when the medicament is swallowed.<br>
The spreading of the medicament in the mouth of the animal leads in part to a coating of the medicament over the buccal mucosa and may lead to some absorption through same. This is one manner in which the medicament of the present invention may be absorbed into the animal.<br>
However, this should not be seen as limiting, as a significant amount, or most of the medicament may, or is likely to be swallowed by the animal, as the medicament is washed off the buccal membrane into the saliva, or as the medicament is administered.<br>
•	The viscosity is low enough that the animal cannot gather the medicament<br>
in its tongue and spit it out. In contrast, this is possible with paste like<br>
formulations.<br>
One of the main advantages of the formulation having the stated degree of viscosity is that it allows the medicament to disperse in the buccal cavity in such a way that the animal cannot spit it out.<br>
•	The medicament spreads easily and reliably throughout the mouth of the<br>
subject. It does not clump together, like more viscous pastes, which are<br>
commonly used. This is a distinct advantage of the medicament of the<br>
present invention.<br>
It is anticipated by the applicants that while some absorption through the buccal membrane may occur, the majority of the- active administered is absorbed or performs its action within the gastrointestinal tract.    The<br>
 <br>
temporary coating of the buccal membrane has the advantageous effect of facilitating the flushing of the medicament into the saliva where it will then be swallowed by the subject.<br>
The clumping tendency of more viscous pastes allows the subject to easily spit the accumulated paste out. This is both a waste of the medicament, and decreases the accuracy with which the dosage can be applied.<br>
• The viscosity is high enough that the medicament is not too fluid, an overly fluid medicament is likely to naturally collect within areas of the animal's mouth, which will result in it being easily spat out.<br>
Similarly, if the medicament is too fluid, it may dribble out of the animal's mouth of its own accord; again this may lead to wastage of the medicament and a decrease in the accuracy with which a dosage of the medicament may be administered.<br>
Further, if the medicament is too fluid there may be leaks of the medicament from the syringe prior to or during administration. Often, the user may have a struggle to administer the medicament to an animal which is not co-operating, if the medicament is too fluid, it can easily be lost during this process by accidental triggering of the syringe by the user.<br>
Further, if the medicament is too fluid, there is a danger of separation of the active ingredients from the liquid carrier.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that suitable physiologically acceptable thickeners or thinners may be required to obtain the desired viscosity. These may be any known compounds which are suitable for administration to the subject, and which will preferably not affect the active<br>
 <br>
ingredients of the medicament, in summary:<br>
•	The medicament is easy to handle and produce.<br>
•	The medicament spreads readily into the mouth as defined above.<br>
•	The combination of at least three different active components decreases the risk of the relevant parasitic species becoming resistant to a particular active ingredient.<br>
•	The combination of at least three different active components also ensures that any parasitic species which have become resistant to one active ingredient may be removed or killed with one of the other active components, thus ensuring more complete and efficient treatment.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the medicament may be administered at a dosage rate suitable for the particular animal species being treated. The dosage rate may vary considerably between species.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, for equine use, the medicament may be administered at a dosage rate of 1 g per 20 kg body weight.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a subject for parasitic helminths, characterised by the step of administering to a subject a sufficient dosage of a medicament substantially as previously described.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of a medicament substantially as herein described for the treatment of an animal.<br>
 <br>
. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for manufacturing a medicament, including the steps of:<br>
a)	mixing the active ingredients, and<br>
b)	adding sufficient additional ingredients in the proportion and type to ensure that the medicament has a viscosity within the range specified herein.<br>
in  one  preferred embodiment the medicament may be manufactured via the following method:<br>
1.	Dissolve sodium metabisulphate in deionised water, and then mix in ceilogen 7A, Tween 80 and Sorbitol 70% with stirring. Suspend praziquantel and oxfendazole and mix well.<br>
2.	in a separate manufacturing vessel, dissolve methyi parabens, propyl parabens and abamectin in benzyl alcohol. Add to the main bulk (1) and mix well.<br>
3.	Add the apple flavor to the main bulk and mix well.<br>
4.	Add wacker silica and then mix plasdone K 25 to the main bulk and mix well.<br>
5.	Heat diethylene glycol stearate at 50-60°C, and then add it to the main bulk and mix well. Homogenise for 20-30 minutes until a smooth and homogenous paste is obtained.<br>
One skilled in the art would realise that this method may vary depending on the preservative, thickening, dispersing and suspending agents utilised.<br>
 <br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following experimentation is given by way of example only:<br>
Objective:<br>
To develop a medicament which has a viscosity or texture which allows the medicament to coat the horses (or other animal's) mouth after administration, and prevent the animal from spitting out the medicament.<br>
Coating of the animal's mouth prevents clumping of the medicament and minimizing the ability of the animal to spit out the product.<br>
The objective was that the medicament was an oral broad spectrum wormer and boticide paste for horses containing three bioactives: Abamectin, Praziquantel and Oxfendazole (or pharmaceutical equivalents thereof) for the treatment and control of tapeworms, roundworms and bots.<br>
Background of product development:<br>
Two medicaments were trialed, (herein referred to product 1 and product 2 respectively).<br>
Conclusions:<br>
The medicament of the present invention is product 1.<br>
The creaminess, texture (viscosity) and pH of this formulation gave it preference to product 2.<br>
Results of the physical and chemical assays of 5 weeks accelerated stability trial indicated that this product was stable over the studied period.<br>
 <br>
Further stability trials over 18 months on samples of this formulation confirmed stability over 18 months.<br>
Product 1 has a viscosity within the desired range, whereas product 2 was a thick paste, this is undesirable as it facilitates the animal spitting out the formulation.<br>
Product 1 also has the following advantages over product 2:<br>
•	It does not form a clump or form a hard ribbon when delivered,<br>
•	It spreads easily within the mouth of the animal, and<br>
