				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel<br>
pharmaceutical use of a compound having an antagonistic<br>
action against AMPA receptor as a therapeutic agent for<br>
glioblastoma.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Glioma is the general name of tumors originating<br>
from ependymoblasts, which is the stem cell for glia, in<br>
the course of the differentiation thereof into ependymal<br>
cell, astroglia and oligodendroglia [Seikagaku Jiten<br>
(Dictionary of Biochemistry), the third edition, Tokyo<br>
Kagaku Dojin, Tokyo, 1998].<br>
Glioblastoms multiforme (referred to as glioblastoma<br>
hereinafter) highly invades the central nervous system and<br>
is ranked at a higher malignancy level among gliomas.<br>
Thus, glioblastoma is a typical one of malignant brain<br>
tumors.<br>
Additionally, the lethal rate thereof is very high<br>
so that the onset thereof induces death in 9 to 12 months.<br>
Even today with the progress in the various therapeutic<br>
methods thereof, the 5-year survival from 1986 to 1990 is<br>
8.0%, compared with the 5-year survival 20 years ago namely<br>
the 5-year survival from 1969 to 1975, which was 11.9%.<br>
Thus, almost no difference is observed (Neurology Progress,<br>
43(3), 338-350, 1999). Accordingly, it is strongly desired<br>
that an effective therapeutic method thereof should be<br>
established.<br>
Tumor cells of glioblastoma are the most<br>
undifferentiated among brain tumors, so the tumor cells<br>
have high potentials of migration and proliferation and are<br>
highly invasive, leading to very poor prognosis.<br>
Glioblastoma is classified into primary glioblastoma<br>
de novo and secondary glioblastoma, depending on the<br>
difference in the gene mechanism of the malignant<br>
transformation of undifferentiated astrocyte or precursor<br>
cells. Secondary glioblastoma occurs in a young generation<br>
of 45 years old or younger. In 4 to 5 years on average,<br>
secondary glioblastoma occurs from astrocytoma through<br>
undifferentiated astrocytoma. Meanwhile, primary<br>
glioblastoma de novo frequently occurs in an older<br>
generation of the mean age of 55 years old. Generally,<br>
primary glioblastoma de novo takes the form of fulminant<br>
glioblastoma (referred to as de novo glioblastoma as well)<br>
which occurs within 3 months from the state with no<br>
clinical or pathological abnormalities [Pathology and<br>
Genetics of the Nervous Systems. 29-39 (IARC Press, Lyon,<br>
France, 2000)].<br>
Glioblastoma migrates along myelinated nerve and<br>
spreads widely in the central nerve. Therefore, surgical<br>
treatment thereof cannot show any satisfactory therapeutic<br>
effect (Neurol. Med. Chir. (Tokyo) 34, 91-94, 1994; Neurol.<br>
Med. Chir. (Tokyo) 33, 425-458, 1993; Neuropathology 17,<br>
186-188, 1997). Additionally, pharmaceutical agents with<br>
an indication for glioblastoma are limited in Japan to for<br>
example ranimustine and interferon. Additionally, the<br>
efficacy thereof is insufficient.<br>
a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic<br>
acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors belong to ionotropic<br>
glutamate receptors are responsible for rapid nerve<br>
conduction of almost all excitatory synapses (Trends<br>
Neurosci. 16, 359-365, 1993; Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17, 31-<br>
108, 1994; Prog. Neurobiol. 54, 581-618, 1998). AMPA<br>
receptors are expressed in many glyacytes like those in<br>
neurons (Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 21, 252-258, 2000). AMPA<br>
receptors are composed of four subunits, namely GluRl<br>
through GluR4. The Ca2+ permeability of an AMPA receptor<br>
depends on the composition with the subunits thereof.<br>
Specifically, an AMPA receptor with the 61uR2 subunit has<br>
low Ca2+ permeability, while an AMPA receptor without GluR2<br>
has high Ca2+ permeability. A higher content of the GluR2<br>
subunit decreases the Ca2+ permeability more (Trends<br>
Neurosci. 16, 359-365, 1993; Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17, 31-<br>
108, 1994; Prog. Neurobiol. 54, 581-618, 1998). Further,<br>
the unique feature of GluR2 is described as follows. In case that one amino acid<br>
residue in the second hydrophobk region (M2), which is originally arginine ( R),<br>
is substituted with glutamlne (Q), the resulting homomer receptor composed of<br>
the substituted GluR2 (Q) has high Ca2* permeability (Trends Neurosci. 16,359-<br>
365, 1993, Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17, 31-108, 1994). In other words, such<br>
receptor at a higher content of the GluR2 subunft when the subunit is GkiR (Q)<br>
type is highly permeable to Ca2+. When the subunit is GluR2 (R), however, the<br>
resulting receptor does not shows any Ca2+ permeability.<br>
Concerning glioma cells and glutamate, reports showed that the expression of<br>
the GluR2 gene is low in C6-glioma (I Neurosci. Res. 46,164-178,1996) and<br>
that 66% of glioblastoma culture cells respond to a glutamate receptor against<br>
and depolarize (Eur. J. Neurosci. 10,2153-2162,1998).<br>
The following reports have been issued about the inhibiting action of antagonists<br>
against the ionotropic glutamate receptor family on glioma and the like.<br>
1) Document WO 00/24395 discloses an invention relating to the method for<br>
inhibiting the interaction between AMPA receptor complexes and<br>
glutamate for cancer treatment, wherein specific examples of brain tumor<br>
include medulbblastoma classified as a fetal tumor and human brain<br>
astrocytoma as one glioma type. The Reference describes<br>
the in vitro effect of an antagonist GYK152446 against AMPA<br>
receptor on brain astrocytoma.<br>
However, the reference does not disclose or suggests<br>
the use of the antagonist against AMPA receptor for<br>
treatment of glioblastoma with high malignancy to have<br>
resistance to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.<br>
 2) Non-patent reference 1 by the inventor<br>
described above includes a description that antagonists<br>
against NMDA- and AMPA receptors are highly sensitive to<br>
tumor cells derived from peripheral cells but poorly<br>
sensitive to tumor cells derived from nerve and glyacites.<br>
Additionally, the reference describes that these<br>
antagonists are useful as therapeutic agents of peripheral<br>
cancer. Thus, the effect of the invention on glioblastoma<br>
cannot be anticipated on the basis of the in vitro effect<br>
using the tumor cells with lower malignancy levels than<br>
that of glioblastoma.<br>
3) Non-patent reference 2 reports that MK-801<br>
and memantin as antagonists against NMDA receptor exert a<br>
proliferation inhibition in the C6 and R62 glioma<br>
transplanted rat models.<br>
However, it is criticized that the previous research<br>
on glioma using such animal models are criticized since<br>
they do not represent real growth of tumor (non-patent<br>
Reference 3)<br>
4) Additionally, non-patent reference 4 as one<br>
critical review of the non-patent reference 1 suggests the<br>
possibility of the inhibition AMPA receptors and NMDA<br>
receptors as a multiple therapy for glioma. However, the<br>
authors are suspicious about whether or not the animal<br>
models using C6 and R62 glioma used in the non-patent<br>
reference 1 can reflect human tumor.<br>
Based on those described above, these previous<br>
techniques do not include any specific descriptions about<br>
the possibility that antagonists against AMPA receptor will<br>
become a therapeutic agent of the most malignant human<br>
glioblastoma among various types of glioma. The effect on<br>
C6 and RG2 glioma does not suggest any possible therapeutic<br>
effect on human glioblastoma.<br>
Thus, the invention is not described in any these<br>
previous techniques, and it cannot be derived readily from<br>
them.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It is an objective of the invention to provide a<br>
therapeutic agent for glioblastoma, which has a novel<br>
action mechanism.<br>
The inventors made investigations so as to attain<br>
the object. The inventors found that the GluR1 and/or<br>
61uR4 subunit was expressed widely in glioblastoma cells,<br>
particularly human primary glioblastoma cell and functioned<br>
as a Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor. Specifically, the<br>
inventors found that the transformation of biological Ca2+-<br>
permeable AMPA receptor into Ca2+-non-permeable AMPA<br>
receptor by transfection of the GluR2(R) gene with<br>
adenovirus vector inhibited migration and induced the<br>
apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. In other words, the<br>
inhibition of Ca2+ permeability by the presence of the<br>
subunit GluR2(R) induces the cell death of glioblastoma<br>
cells. Further, the inventors found that in contrast,<br>
excess expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor promoted<br>
not only the morphological change and growth of the tumor<br>
cell but also the migration ability.<br>
Still further, the inventor established an animal<br>
model highly reflecting the pathological feature of human<br>
glioblastoma and used this model for verifying the effect<br>
in accordance with the invention. The animal model with a<br>
transplanted human glioblastoma cell line CGNH-89 as<br>
established by the inventor reflects the pathological<br>
feature of human glioblastoma, where the cell vigorously<br>
invades the inside of brain parenchyma and the subpial<br>
brain to induce disseminated meningitis.<br>
Accordingly, the inventors certified that a<br>
compound, which has high antagonistic effect against AMPA<br>
receptor inhibits tumor growth in an animal model<br>
reflecting human glioblastoma, based on the findings that<br>
the AMPA receptors of glioblastoma cell were composed of<br>
the GluRl and/or GluR4 subunit not GluR2 and the high Ca2+<br>
permeability of the AMPA receptor was responsible for the<br>
marked growth and migration abilities of human glioblastoma<br>
cell. Thus, the invention has been achieved.<br>

therapeutic agent for glioblastoma, which comprises a<br>

A pharmaceutical formulation containing the compound<br>
for use in accordance with the present invention or one<br>
type or two types or more of the salt thereof as the active<br>
ingredients are prepared, using carriers, excipients and<br>
other additives for general use in formulation.<br>
The carriers and excipients for formulation may be<br>
solid or liquid, and include for example lactose, magnesium<br>
stearate, starch, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, gum arabic,<br>
olive oil, sesame oil, cacao butter, and ethylene glycol<br>
and other routine such ones.<br>
Administration thereof may satisfactorily be either<br>
oral administration via tablets, pills, capsules, granules,<br>
powders, liquids and the like or parenteral administration<br>
via injections via intravenous injections, intramuscular<br>
injections and the like, suppositories and transcutaneous<br>
agents.<br>
The dose is appropriately determined, depending on<br>
each case, in terms of the symptom, age, sex and the like<br>
of a subject to be dosed. Generally, the daily dose of the<br>
compound of the present invention is about 100 to 2,000 mg<br>
per adult per day, preferably about 900 mg per adult per<br>
day. 100 to 2,000 mg per adult per day by dividing the<br>
daily dose into one or two to four doses per day. In case<br>
of intravenous administration or sustained intravenous<br>
administration, the administration may satisfactorily be<br>
administered for one hour to 24 hours per day.<br>
As described above, the dose can be determined by<br>
taking into consideration various conditions. A dose less<br>
than the range described above may also be used in case<br>
that the dose is effective.<br>
The compound for use in accordance with the present<br>
invention is mainly administered by parenteral<br>
administration, specifically including subcutaneous<br>
administration, intramuscular administration, intravenous<br>
administration, transcutaneous administration, intrahecal<br>
administration, epidural administration, intrajoint<br>
administration and local administration, or may also be<br>
administered in various dosage forms, for example by oral<br>
administration if possible.<br>
The injections for parenteral administration include<br>
for example sterile, aqueous or non-aqueous solutions,<br>
suspensions and emulsions. The aqueous solutions and<br>
suspensions include for example distilled water for<br>
injections and physiological saline. The non-aqueous<br>
solutions and suspensions include for example propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive<br>
oil, alcohols such as ethanol, and Polysorbate 80 (under<br>
trade name). Such composition may contain auxiliary agents<br>
such as preservatives, moistening agents, emulsifying<br>
agents, dispersing agents, stabilizers (for example,<br>
lactose) and dissolution auxiliary agents (for example,<br>
meglumine). These are sterilized by filtering through<br>
bacteria-retaining filters, blending sterilizing agents, or<br>
irradiation. Alternatively, these may be produced once<br>
into a sterile solid composition and then dissolved or<br>
suspended in sterile water or sterile solvents for<br>
injections, prior to use.<br>
As the solid composition for oral administration,<br>
tablets, powders, granules and the like are used. In such<br>
solid composition, one or more active substances are mixed<br>
with at least one inert excipient, for example lactose,<br>
mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
metasilicic acid and magnesium aluminate. According to<br>
general methods, the composition may contain inert<br>
additives other than diluents, lubricants for example<br>
magnesium stearate, disintegrators for example fibrin<br>
calcium glucorate, stabilizers such as lactose and<br>
dissolution auxiliary agents such as glutamate or aspartic<br>
acid. On a needed basis, the tablets or pills may<br>
satisfactorily be coated with sugar coating or with films<br>
of stomach-soluble or gut-soluble substances such as<br>
sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate.<br>

diluents for general use, for example distilled water and<br>
ethanol. The composition may contain auxiliary agents such<br>
as moistening agents and suspending agents, sweetening<br>
agents, flavoring agents, aromatic agents and<br>
preservatives, other than the inert diluents.<br>
[Examples]<br>
The present invention is now described in detail in<br>
the following Examples. However, the invention should not<br>
be limited to those in the following Examples.<br>
The therapeutic effect of the present invention was<br>
confirmed by the following experimental method.<br>
Experimental Example 1<br>
Growith inhibition of glioblastoma in vitro<br>
Human glioblastoma cell (CGNH-89 cell line) was used<br>
at this experiment. These cells were randomly divided in<br>
the following three groups: a group of a glutamate-free<br>
medium (no glutamate group; control group); a group of<br>
the glutamate-f ree medium added 100 mM glutamate (100 mM<br>
glutamate group); a group of the glutamate-free medium<br>
added 100 mM glutamate and 20 mM NBQX (100 mM glutamate +<br>
20 mM NBQX group) . The cells were incubated for 48 hours.<br>
The CGNH-89 cell was cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco"s modified<br>
Eagle"s medium) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf<br>
serum.<br>
CGNH-89 cell line<br>
CGNH-89 cell line was established through resection<br>
from the tumor at the right front lobe of a 56-year old<br>
lady according to the Explant method by Nicolas et al.<br>
(Science 196, 60-63, 1977). The cell line shows activities<br>
of glia cell fibrous acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, A2B5,<br>
O4 and myelin basic protein (J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol.,<br>
57653-663, 1998) . Additionally, the mRNAs of GluRl through<br>
GluR4 were analyzed with antibodies against the AMPA<br>
receptor subunits GluRl, GluR2, GluR3 and GluR4 and RT-PCR.<br>
Consequently, the cell line expresses GluRl and GluR4 but<br>
not expresses GluR2 and GluR3. As described above, the<br>
cell line has the same profile as that of the cell of<br>
primary glioblastoma de novo.<br>
Furthermore, the cell line is provided by the<br>
inventor and is available on request to? the inventor.<br>
The anti-tumor action was evaluated by calculating<br>
the apoptosis score by TUNEL method (terminal<br>
deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end<br>
labeling) 48 hours after culturing. Additionally,<br>
proliferation of the human glioblastoma cell was evaluated,<br>
using the antibody Ki67.<br>
The results are shown as mean ± standard deviation<br>
and statistically analyzed by the Student"s t-test.<br>
Significance level was set at p 
Test Results<br>
In the no glutamate group, apoptosis was induced in<br>
18% of the human glioblastoma cells within the 48-hour<br>
incubation period. Additionally, almost no proliferation<br>
was observed. In contrast, the addition of 100 mM<br>
glutamate to the culture medium decreased the apoptosis<br>
down to 3%, while the proliferative activity increased to<br>
18.5%. Meanwhile, NBQX as an antagonist against AMPA<br>
receptor inhibited the action of suppressing apoptosis as<br>
induced by glutamate, so that NBQX induced the apoptosis.<br>
Additionally, NBQX suppressed the glutamate-induced<br>
proliferative activity (Table 1).<br>
TUNEL-SCORE:<br>
The number of TUNEL positive cell meaning a cell<br>
with DNA fragmented by apoptosis in the microscopic field<br>
of vision divided by the number of total cells represented<br>
as PI (propidium iodine) positive nucleus in the same field<br>
of vision is shown as the TUNEL SCORE.<br>
Staining index with Ki-67:<br>
The number of Ki-67 positive cells in the<br>
microscopic field of vision as divided by the number of<br>
total cells represented as PI (propidium iodine) positive<br>
nucleus in the same field of vision is shown as the<br>
staining index.<br>
* p 
** p 
Based on the results, it was confirmed that the AMPA<br>
receptor antagonist inhibits the suppression of the<br>
apoptosis by glutamate and inhibits glutamate-induced<br>
proliferation of glioblastoma in vitro.<br>
Experimental Example 2<br>
Growth inhibition on the glioblastoma (human glioblastoma)<br>
in vivo<br>
Nude mice (5-6 weeks old) were used at this<br>
experiment. 107 cells of CGNH-89 used in Example 1 were<br>
transplanted subcutaneously in the nude mice. On the next<br>
day of transplantation, the mice were divided randomly in<br>
two groups; a group (n = 12) to be administered with 100<br>
mg/kg compound A and a group (n = 12) to be administered<br>
with PBS (phosphate buffered saline) . The drug was<br>
administered repeatedly intraperitoneally for 14 days<br>
starting on the next day of transplantation. Up to day 8<br>
after the completion of the administration, the mice were<br>
observed. The tumor size was measured every two days with<br>
a vernier micrometer, to calculate the volume according to<br>
the formula (length x width2) x 1/2.<br>
The results are shown in mean ± standard deviation<br>
and statistically analyzed by the Student"s t-test. The<br>
significance level was set at p 
Test results<br>
Compound A as an antagonist against AMPA receptor<br>
expressed a significant tumor growth inhibition on days 11<br>
and 13 after the onset of administration and on days 2, 4,<br>
6 and 8 after the completion of administration (Fig. 1).<br>
Based on the results, it was confirmed that the<br>
antagonist against AMPA receptor showed an excellent tumor<br>
growth inhibition even in vivo on the glioblastoma cell<br>
with the pathological feature of human glioblastoma.<br>
Experimental Example 3<br>
Growth inhibition on glioblastoma (human glioblastoma) in<br>
the orthotopic xenograft model<br>
Using an orthotopic xenograft model, in which CGNH-<br>
89 is transplanted in the brain parenchyma of mouse or rat,<br>
the anti-tumor effect of an antagonist against AMPA<br>
receptor is evaluated. The dose of compound A is 50 mg/kg<br>
or 10 mg/kg. On the next day of the transplantation of the<br>
tumor, intraperitoneal administration of compound A<br>
started for 14 days. On day 21, a specimen is prepared for<br>
pathological analysis.<br>
Example (Production of freeze-dried formulation)<br>
33.3 g of meglumine was dissolved in 400 ml of<br>
distilled water for injections, to which 10 g of compound A<br>
was added for dissolution with stirring. 1,400 ml of<br>
distilled water for injections was added to the resulting<br>
solution. Additionally, 40 g of mannitol was dissolved in<br>
the solution, to which distilled water for injections was<br>
added to 2,000 ml. The resulting solution was filtered<br>
aseptically by general method. 15 ml of the resulting<br>
filtrate was charged in a 30-ml vial and freeze-dried by<br>
general method, to prepare a freeze-dried formulation of<br>
the compound for use in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
In accordance with the present invention, compounds<br>
with an antagonistic action against AMPA receptor, which is<br>
preferably zonanpanel or a salt or hydrate thereof or NBQX,<br>
are useful as therapeutic agents of glioblastoma,<br>
particularly primary glioblastoma de novo with a high<br>
malignancy level.<br>
