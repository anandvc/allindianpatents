				<td>TOWER DISPENSER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to beverage dispensing and, more particularly, but not<br>
by way of limitation, to methods and an apparatus for dispensing beverages effectively<br>
with a reduced width beverage dispenser.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the beverage dispensing industry, counter top space continues to be a precious<br>
commodity. Store owners continuously face the problem of not having adequate counter<br>
top space to house all of the different types of product dispensing equipment and related<br>
supplies. Beverage dispenser manufacturers are continually pressed to provide smaller<br>
dispensers while increasing dispenser capabilities. Beverage dispensers with increased<br>
features typically include additional valves and additional flow controllers for additional<br>
product flow paths.<br>
Existing beverage dispenser designs require a minimum width per nozzle or in the<br>
case of a multi-flavor nozzle, a certain width per flow control module pair. As such, any<br>
increased number of flavors or dispensing valves in a beverage dispenser creates a<br>
compounding width dimension, as the flow control modules are typically in close<br>
proximity to the dispensing nozzle for easy servicing.<br>
Further, the recent popularity and increased usage of non-carbonated beverages<br>
and ambient refreshments creates increased demands on remote towers, as more flow<br>
control devices must be utilized to control the flows of the added products. The situation<br>
if still further complicated by the addition of bonus flavors that are injected into a brand<br>
beverage, as the beverage dispenser likewise must accommodate and control the flow of<br>
the bonus flavorings.<br>
Accordingly, an easily serviceable beverage dispenser able to provide increased<br>
capabilities without the increased width associated with standard beverage dispenser<br>
designs would be beneficial to beverage dispenser operators, beverage dispenser<br>
manufacturers, and beverage dispenser service agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a beverage dispenser includes a tower<br>
having a tower cavity and a tower head disposed atop the tower. The beverage dispenser<br>
further includes at least one beverage syrup flow path and at least one control module<br>
disposed within the tower to regulate the flows of a beverage syrup through the at least<br>
2<br><br>
one flow path. In this arrangement, the beverage dispenser tower head size requirements<br>
are minimized, as fewer components are located within the tower head. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the beverage dispenser may further include additional flow paths to provide<br>
the beverage dispenser with the capability to dispense uncarbonated diluents, carbonated<br>
diluents, ambient beverages, injected flavorings, and the like. One of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will recognize that control modules for the varying flow paths may be located within<br>
the tower to further reduce the envelope of the tower head of the beverage dispenser.<br>
The tower head further includes a fully accessible cavity having a cover and an<br>
interface plate that opens for increased access into the cavity. Once opened, a crossbar<br>
may be removed to provide unlimited frontal and top access, such that any components<br>
disposed within the tower head may be readily accessible. The beverage dispenser further<br>
includes a control board including at least one input receptor and an output device<br>
disposed on a top of the beverage dispenser, such that an operator may easily interact with<br>
the control board to configure the beverage dispenser. In this embodiment, the control<br>
board is attached to a plate rotatably mounted to the cover, such that the control board is<br>
substantially vertical when the cover is open, and horizontal and beneath the cover when<br>
the cover is in a closed position. In this arrangement, the control board is usable by the<br>
operator from a front of the beverage dispenser.<br>
In another embodiment, the beverage dispenser may be utilized in a master/slave<br>
arrangement, wherein a slave beverage dispenser without a control board is disposed<br>
adjacent to and in communication with the control board of the master beverage dispenser,<br>
such that the master beverage dispenser conducts all global operations, and configuration<br>
operations.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a reduced width<br>
beverage dispenser having at least one control module disposed within a tower cavity.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a beverage dispenser with a<br>
control board disposed at a top of the beverage dispenser, wherein an operator interacts<br>
with the control board from a front of the beverage dispenser.<br>
It is still further an object of the present invention to provide a beverage dispenser<br>
with an increased accessibility to a cavity.<br>
It is still yet further an object of the present invention to provide a beverage<br>
dispenser system including a master beverage dispense in communication with a slave<br>
beverage dispenser, wherein the master beverage dispenser conducts all global and<br>
configuration operations<br>
3<br><br>
Still other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become<br>
evident to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the following. Also, it should be<br>
understood that the scope of this invention is intended to be broad, and any combination of<br>
any subset of the features, elements, or steps described herein is part of the intended scope<br>
of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT:<br>
As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein;<br>
however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of<br>
the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. It is further to be understood that<br>
the figures are not necessarily to scale, and some features may be exaggerated to show<br>
details of particular components or steps.<br>
Beverage dispensers are commonly known in the art as the devices that deliver on<br>
demand beverages to consumers. Historically, the beverage dispenser provided a mixing<br>
and dispensing point for a syrup concentrate and a carbonated diluent. In recent times, the<br>
term "beverage," as utilized in conjunction with the beverage dispenser, has been<br>
expanded to additionally refer to ambient drinks, plain waters, flavored waters, and bonus<br>
flavorings. The expansion of the term was necessary, as newer dispenser designs currently<br>
4<br><br>
provide the capability to dispense the aforementioned types of beverages. The increased<br>
versatility of the beverage dispenser generally requires more components than older type<br>
dispensers. As such, beverage dispenser manufacturers are continually forced to devise<br>
new ways of putting more components into smaller packages. As one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will recognize, most beverage dispensers provide flow paths for each type or flavor<br>
of product, as well as for any diluents, carbonated diluents, and bonus flavors. Each flow<br>
path still further includes a control module in communication with a control system;<br>
illustratively, a valve in communication with a processor, wherein the control module<br>
commences and ceases the product flow. Control module accordingly in this disclosure<br>
refers to a control module for a diluent flow path, a beverage syrup flow path, a bonus<br>
flavor flow path, or the like. While there may be slight differences between the locations<br>
of the control modules within a tower dispenser of the preferred embodiments, the<br>
locations of the control modules are interchangeable with each other. At least one<br>
embodiment of this disclosure relates to the relocation of control modules to locations not<br>
ordinarily utilized in typical beverage dispensers, illustratively, a tower portion.<br>
As shown in Figures 1-3, a beverage dispenser 100 includes a housing 140, an<br>
interface panel 111, a nozzle 135, a splash plate 145, and a cover 112. The housing 140<br>
may include a tower 143 and a tower head 144. The tower 143 is rectangular in shape,<br>
and includes a first wall 156, a second wall 157, and a third wall 158 at substantially right<br>
angles, such that the tower walls 156,157, and 158 create a tower cavity 160. The tower<br>
143 further includes a first flange 161 disposed adjacent to the first wall 156, and a second<br>
flange 162 adjacent to the third wall 158 along a front 105 of the beverage dispenser 100.<br>
The first flange 161 and the second flange 162 further enclose the tower cavity 160. In<br>
this first embodiment, the first and second flanges 161 and 162 extend the full length of<br>
the tower 143, and have a width suitable for housing restraint features 146 for the splash<br>
plate 145. In this configuration, the tower cavity 160 is accessible from the front 105 of<br>
the beverage dispenser 100. Access to the tower cavity 160 from the front 105 of the<br>
beverage dispenser 100 is advantageous to operators, as the beverage dispensers are<br>
typically situated adjacent to one another on a counter top. While this first embodiment is<br>
shown with a rectangular tower 143, it should be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
that a tower 143 may be of virtually any shape or configuration.<br>
The tower 143 may further include a drip tray 120 near a first end 148 of the tower<br>
143, and in this first embodiment, the drip tray 120 is integral to the tower 143. The drip<br>
tray 120 may further include a cup rest 125, whereby the cup rest 125 supports cups that<br>
5<br><br>
are going to be filled at the beverage dispenser 100. The drip tray 120 may include a drain<br>
154 to evacuate fluids that end up within the drip tray 120. The first end 148 of the tower<br>
143 is planar, such that the tower 143 may rest on a flat surface such as a counter top.<br>
The tower head 144 is an enclosure having a first wall 165, a second wall 166, a<br>
third wall 167, a first flange 168, and a second flange 169. The first wall 165 is joined to<br>
the second wall 166 at substantially a ninety-degree angle, and the second wall 166 is<br>
mounted to the third wall 167 at substantially a ninety-degree angle, such that the walls<br>
form a cavity 170. The size of the tower head 144 is complementary to the width of the<br>
tower 143. The first flange 168 and the second flange 169 of the tower head 144 are<br>
disposed along the front 105 of the beverage dispenser 100, and folded toward the cavity<br>
170 at approximately ninety-degree angles to further enclose the cavity 170. A first end<br>
151 of the tower head 144 includes a floor 172 that closes out a lower portion of the tower<br>
head 144. The floor 172 may include a nozzle port 174 for accepting the dispensing<br>
nozzle 135. While the floor 172 is shown with a single nozzle port 174, one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will recognize that multiple nozzles may be utilized in a beverage dispenser.<br>
While the tower head 144 has been described as a rectangular section, it should be clear to<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art that the tower head 144 may be any form or shape capable<br>
of having a cavity.<br>
A second end 152 of the tower head 144 may include a first flange 176 attached to<br>
the first wall 165, and a second flange 177 attached to the third wall 167. The first flange<br>
176 and the second flange 177 are directed inward toward the cavity 170, and are of a<br>
width suitable for supporting a roller, illustratively one half of an inch. The first flange<br>
176 and the second flange 177 may further include an engagement slot 178 for accepting<br>
reinforcement components. The housing 110 further includes a crossbar 180. In this first<br>
embodiment, the crossbar 180 extends from the first wall 165 to the third wall 167 to<br>
provide lateral support to the walls 165 and 167 of the tower head 144. The cross bar 180<br>
is of a sheetmetal construction, preferably stainless steel, and includes a first side 181 and<br>
a second side 182 at substantially a ninety degree angle. The first side 181 of the crossbar<br>
180 may further include restraint mechanisms 184. Each end of the crossbar 180 may<br>
include a tab 183 for engagement purposes.<br>
On assembly of the housing 140, the tower head 144 is positioned on top of the<br>
tower 143, such that the first end 151 of the tower head 144 is adjacent to a second end<br>
149 of the tower 143. The tower head 144 is further positioned such that the cavity 170<br>
exposed between the first and second flanges 168 and 169 faces the same direction as the<br>
6<br><br>
exposed portion of the tower cavity 160, illustratively the front 105 of the beverage<br>
dispenser 100. The tower head 144 further includes a first hinge 187. The first hinge 187<br>
includes a first leg, a second leg, and an axis. The first leg of the first hinge 187 is<br>
attached along an uppermost edge of the second wall 166.<br>
The cover 112 closes out a top portion of the cavity 170. In this first embodiment,<br>
the cover 112 is formed from sheet metal, and includes a planar surface 191 having a first<br>
flange 192, a second flange 193, a third flange 194, and a fourth flange 195. The flanges<br>
192, 193, 194, and 195 extend in the same direction and are joined to form an enclosure.<br>
In this embodiment, the fourth flange 195 is located nearest the second wall 166 of the<br>
tower head 144, and is further attached to the second leg of the first hinge 187, such that<br>
the cover 112 may rotate downward about the axis of the first hinge 187 to close out the<br>
cavity 170 or upward to access the cavity 170. In this arrangement, the cover 112 lifts<br>
away from the front 105 of the beverage dispenser 100, such that an operator may view<br>
into the cavity 170. The second flange 193 and the third flange 194 further include at least<br>
one pin aperture 196, and at least one pin aperture 197, respectively. The pin apertures<br>
196 and 197 are disposed on an inner lip of the first flange 192 and the third flange 194, at<br>
a point substantially central along the length of the first and third flanges 192 and 194.<br>
The beverage dispenser 100 still further includes a board mounting plate 214<br>
having a first end 219, a second end 220, a first leg 215, a second leg 216, a first mount<br>
217 and a second mount 218. In this first embodiment, the board mounting plate 214 is<br>
complementary to a width between the first and second flanges 176 and 177 of the tower<br>
head 144. The board mounting plate 214 may be constructed from virtually any material<br>
suitable for rigid support, preferably non conductive materials, however, one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will recognize that metal such as stainless steel may be utilized if<br>
electrically isolated from any powered components. The first leg 215 and the second leg<br>
216 may be any form of screw, pin, or roller secured to the extreme ends of the first end<br>
219 such that they protrude from the board mounting plate 214. The first mount 217 and<br>
the second mount 218 may be any type of screw or removable pin connection, such that<br>
the board mounting plate 214 may be attached to the cover 112. In this first embodiment,<br>
the first mount 217 of the board mounting plate 214 passes through the pin aperture 196,<br>
and the second mount 218 passes through the pin aperture 197, such that the board<br>
mounting plate 214 is rotatably coupled to the cover 112. In this configuration, the first<br>
and second legs 215 and 216 of the board mounting plate 214 rest on top of the first and<br>
second flanges 176 and 177 of the tower head 144. Once pinned, the board mounting<br>
7<br><br>
plate 214 translates with the cover 112 when the cover 112 moves from the open position<br>
to the closed position. Accordingly, in the raised position the board mounting plate 214 is<br>
slightly tilted away from the front 105 of the beverage dispenser 100, illustratively twenty<br>
to thirty degrees, such that an operator may easily view the board mounting plate 214. In<br>
the closed position the board mounting plate 214 is lies in a substantially horizontal<br>
position beneath the cover 112. This arrangement creates an easily accessible board<br>
mounting plate 214.<br>
The interface panel 111 provides a means for a user to interact with the beverage<br>
dispenser 100. The interface panel 111 includes a first end 201, a second end 202, and<br>
attraction plates 203 disposed on the second end 202 of the interface panel 111. The<br>
housing 110 farther includes a second hinge 188 having a first leg, a second leg, and an<br>
axis therebetween. The first leg of the second hinge 188 is attached to an edge of the floor<br>
172 that is exposed between the first flange 168 and the second flange 169 on the tower<br>
head 144. The first end 201 of the interface panel 111 is attached to the second leg of the<br>
second hinge 188, such that the interface panel 111 may pivot about the axis of the second<br>
hinge 188. In a lowered position, the interface panel 111 provides access to the cavity 170<br>
from the front 105 of the beverage dispenser 100. In a closed position, the attraction<br>
plates 203 move the second end 202 of the interface panel 111 toward the restraint<br>
mechanisms 184. In this first embodiment, the restraint mechanisms 184 are magnets<br>
secured to the crossbar 180, and the attraction plates 203 are of a magnetic construction,<br>
such that they force the interface panel 111 toward the tower head 144 when within range<br>
of the magnetic field, thereby closing out the cavity 170. The ability to readily access and<br>
close out the cavity 170 from the front of the beverage dispenser 100 provides an added<br>
benefit to operators of the beverage dispenser 100, as they can easily access components<br>
disposed within the cavity 170. The interface panel 111 may further be complementary in<br>
shape to a front 212 of the tower head 144. The second hinge 188 may be secured to the<br>
attached components using any suitable means, including screws, welding, or the like.<br>
The splash plate 145 may be any structure suitable for redirecting fluids moving<br>
toward the tower cavity 160. The splash plate 145 may be constructed from any suitable<br>
material that is impervious to beverage concentrates, carbonated waters, and the like, for<br>
example, stainless steel. The splash plate 1,45 is complementary in size to the exposed<br>
portion of the tower cavity 160, such that it closes out the tower cavity 160. In this first<br>
embodiment, the splash plate 145 includes at least one attraction plate 205 mounted to an<br>
inner surface 206 of the splash plate 145. The attraction plates 205 are complementary in<br>
8<br><br>
location to the restraint features 146 located on the flanges 161 and 162 of the tower 143.<br>
When the splash plate 145 is placed onto the tower 143, the restraint features 146 pull the<br>
attraction plates 205 against the restraint features 146, thereby holding the splash plate 145<br>
in a mounted position. In the mounted position, the splash plate 145 redirects misdirected<br>
fluids to the drip tray 120 for at least a partial containment. The use of an easily<br>
removable and replaceable restraint scheme provides the operator with the ability to<br>
quickly access components disposed behind the splash plate 145.<br>
The beverage dispenser 100 utilizes a multi-flavor nozzle 135 such as that<br>
disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 6,098,842; 6,047,859; and 6,345,729, the<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, to eliminate the width<br>
requirement associated with conventional single flavor nozzles. The nozzle 135 is<br>
disposed in the nozzle port 174 located in the floor 172 of the tower head 144. The nozzle<br>
135 is elevated above the drip tray 120 and the cup rest 125, such that there is clearance<br>
for a cup to be placed beneath the nozzle 135, and errant fluids will land within the<br>
confines of the drip tray 120.<br>
In this first embodiment, the beverage dispenser 100 is an island dispenser for a<br>
larger dispensing system, and accordingly, as one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize, any syrups and diluents must be conditioned by a backroom or remote device<br>
(not shown). The dispensing system may further include a recirculation pump (also<br>
remote). In this arrangement, all product lines from the beverage dispenser 100 pass<br>
through the counter to mate with lines from the back room system. In this first<br>
embodiment, the beverage dispenser 100 includes flow paths for four syrup brand circuits,<br>
two diluent circuits, and two injected flavor circuits. For illustrative purposes, only one of<br>
the brand and one of the injected flavor circuits will be discussed herein.<br>
A first brand flow path commences exterior to the tower 143, such that syrup<br>
connections to the beverage dispenser 100 may be made beneath a counter when the<br>
beverage dispenser 100 is in an installed position. The brand connection line passes<br>
through the tower 143 to gain access to the cavity 170, where it mates to a first control<br>
module 226. The first brand flow path then moves to a delivery tube. The delivery tube<br>
then leads to a first syrup port on the nozzle 135. In this first embodiment, the first control<br>
module 226 is a volumetric syrup module. As one of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
recognize, the volumetric control module may be replaced with manual flow controls to<br>
reduce costs.<br>
9<br><br>
A first diluent circuit also commences exterior to the tower 143. A first diluent line<br>
passes through the tower cavity 160 and enters the tower head 144 to mate with a second<br>
control module 233 that is disposed within the cavity 170. The first diluent circuit<br>
continues to a first diluent delivery tube. The first diluent delivery tube leads to a first port<br>
of a tee. A second port of the tee is then coupled to a second diluent feed tube that mates<br>
to the diluent port of the nozzle 135. In this first embodiment, the second control module<br>
233 is a volumetric control module that is routinely utilized in the industry. As one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize, a volumetric second control module 233 may be<br>
replaced with manual flow controls to reduce costs.<br>
A second diluent circuit includes a second diluent line, a third control module 252,<br>
a second diluent delivery tube, the tee, and the diluent feed tube. A first end of the second<br>
diluent line protrudes from the first end 148 of the tower 143 for mating to a suitable<br>
supply. The second diluent line leads to the third control module 252 that is disposed<br>
within the tower cavity 160. The second diluent circuit continues through the second<br>
diluent delivery tube that attaches to a third port of the tee. The second diluent circuit<br>
continues through to the second port of the tee, and through the diluent feed tube to the<br>
diluent port of the nozzle 135. In this first embodiment, the second diluent circuit carries<br>
plain water, however one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that virtually any<br>
suitable diluent may be utilized within the confines of the second diluent circuit, including<br>
carbonated diluent, plain water, and the like. The placement of the third control module<br>
252 into the tower cavity 160 reduces the width associated with having additional control<br>
modules in the cavity 170, thereby providing increased capabilities within a smaller<br>
envelope.<br>
A first flavor injection circuit commences with a first flavor line protruding from<br>
the tower 143 in similar fashion to the previously described lines, and connecting to a<br>
fourth control module 262. The first flavor injection circuit continues through the fourth<br>
control module 262 to a flavor delivery tube. The flavor delivery tube then connects to a<br>
first flavor port of the nozzle 135. In this first embodiment, the fourth control module 262<br>
is a flow control valve, and is located within the tower cavity 160. The placement of the<br>
fourth control module 262 into the tower cavity 160 further reduces the volume and width<br>
required in standard dispenser designs with equivalent dispensing options.<br>
The beverage dispenser 100 further includes a control system 270 to regulate the<br>
product flows of the beverage dispenser 100. The control system 270 is of the type that<br>
utilizes a valve control module 271 to control the direct dispense related operations. The<br>
10<br><br>
control system 270 further includes a control board 272 having a controller 273, an output<br>
device 274, and input receptors 275. In this first embodiment, the output device 274 is a<br>
lead crystal display panel that provides feedback to an operator. The input receptors 275<br>
are disposed on the same side of the control board 272 as the output device 274. In this<br>
first embodiment, the input receptors 275 are buttons. The control board 272 further<br>
includes multiple communication ports, illustratively a first communication port 284, a<br>
second communication port 285, a third communication port 286, and a fourth<br>
communication port 287.<br>
In this first embodiment, the control board 272 is mounted to the board mounting<br>
plate 214, such that the output device 274 is readable from the front 105 of the beverage<br>
dispenser 100 when the cover 112 is in a raised position. The placement of the control<br>
board 272 onto the board mounting plate 214 allows the operator to quickly access the<br>
control board 272 by raising the cover 112 to the raised position. Once the control board<br>
272 has been accessed, the operator may utilize the input receptors 275 and output device<br>
274 during setup and/or diagnosis of problems. The control system 270 further includes a<br>
power harness 279, a communication harness 278, and a valve wiring harness 277. The<br>
power harness 279 provides power to the control board 272. The communication harness<br>
278 connects to the first communication port 284, and provides a path for communication<br>
between the valve control module 271 and the controller 273 disposed on the control<br>
board 272. The valve wiring harness 277 transmits signals from the valve control module<br>
271 to the individual control modules 226, 233, 252, and 262 disposed in the fluid flow<br>
paths, thereby commencing and ceasing the flows associated with a selected dispense.<br>
The valve control module 271 is disposed within the interface panel 111 of the<br>
beverage dispenser 100. The valve control module 271 is of the type that provides a<br>
backlit touch sensitive user interface 118 that is configurable to operate and dispense<br>
virtually any combination of zones 119 that represent four brands of concentrate, two<br>
types of diluent, and two bonus flavors, as described in United States Patent application<br>
10/677,854, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In this<br>
configuration, the valve control module 271 controls the user interface 118 for product<br>
selection and dispensing. As such, when a user touches a zone 119 of the user interface<br>
118 of the valve control module 271, a particular beverage associated with the zone 119 is<br>
dispensed. A user is further able to select a bonus flavor with the brand selection, or a<br>
plain water dispense instead of a brand selection.<br>
11<br><br>
In the assembled form, the beverage dispenser 100 provides a reduced footprint<br>
dispenser suitable for use on a counter top. The placement of at least one control module<br>
226, 233, 252 or 262 into the tower 143 portion of the beverage dispenser 100 clearly<br>
reduces the number of components that must be placed in the cavity 170 for flow control,<br>
as well as the volume of the beverage dispenser 100. While this embodiment has been<br>
shown with the second control module 252 and fourth control module 262 disposed within<br>
the tower cavity 160, it should be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art that the control<br>
modules 226, 233, 252 and 262 from any of the flow paths may be placed within the tower<br>
cavity 160, thereby further reducing the size and volume requirements of the beverage<br>
dispenser 100. It should further be noted that any combination of the control modules 226,<br>
233, 252, or 262 may be placed within the tower cavity 160, illustratively, one diluent<br>
control module in combination with one syrup control module, all diluent control modules,<br>
or the like.<br>
The use of magnets 146 on the splash plate 145 provides the ability to easily access<br>
the tower cavity 160 to service any control modules 226, 233, 252 or 262 that have placed<br>
into the tower cavity 160. Components located within the cavity 170 are also easily<br>
accessible by lowering the interface panel 111. The use of magnets in restraining the<br>
interface panel 111 provides frontal access to the components disposed within the cavity<br>
170. Raising the cover 112 to an open position provides top access to the cavity 170.<br>
With the cover 112 and the interface panel 111 opened, an operator may remove the<br>
crossbar 180 to gain total access from a front 105 to rear direction.<br>
The raising of the cover 112 further provides access to the control board 272, the<br>
output device 274 and the input receptors 275. In the raised position, the operator may<br>
interact with the control board 272 to program the beverage dispenser 100. Illustratively,<br>
the operator may read the liquid crystal display and input selections into the input<br>
receptors 275. Once the beverage dispenser 100 has been configured, the operator may<br>
lower the cover 112 to close out the cavity 170.<br>
In operation, the control board 272 conducts and directs the beverage dispenser<br>
operations including programming of the valve control module 271, and the valve control<br>
module 271 conducts the dispensing operations. As the beverage dispenser 100 is shorter<br>
than most counter dispensers, approximately between twenty and twenty one inches,<br>
operators are able to view over the beverage dispenser 100, or at the control board 272<br>
when the cover 112 is in an open position. With the cover 112 in the closed position, the<br>
12<br><br>
cover 112 protects the control board 272. With the interface panel 111 in the closed<br>
position, the valve control module 271 is accessible for use.<br>
As shown in the method flowchart of Fig. 3b, an operator lifts the cover 112 to<br>
gain access to the control board 272, step 2. While the cover 112 moves to the raised<br>
position, the upper end of the control board 272 moves with the cover 112 to the raised<br>
angled position. In this position, the control board 272 is within the sight and reach of the<br>
operator. The operator may then conduct any necessary configuration operations<br>
including reading the output device 274 and providing input through the input receptors<br>
275, step 4. Once the configuration changes have been accomplished, the operator may<br>
then lower the cover 112 and return to dispensing product, step 6. Once the beverage<br>
dispenser 100 is properly configured, an operator is able to secure a beverage from the<br>
beverage dispenser 100 by placing a cup below the nozzle 135, touching a particular zone<br>
119, and retrieving the cup.<br>
In this configuration, the beverage dispenser 100 is easily serviceable, as shown in<br>
the method flowchart of Figure 3c. The process commences with step 10, wherein the<br>
cover is raised to gain access to a top portion of the cavity 170. The operator then lowers<br>
the interface panel 111 to gain access to the cavity 170 from the front 105 of the beverage<br>
dispenser 100, step 12. The operator may then remove the crossbar 180 as shown in step<br>
14 to ease access to all components housed in the cavity 170. With the front and top<br>
sections of the cavity 170 now exposed, the operator may service or replace any<br>
malfunctioning components, step 16. Once the servicing of the components is completed,<br>
the operator may then reinstall the crossbar 180 to reinforce the tower head 144, as shown<br>
in step 18. Step 20 provides for raising the interface panel 111 to close out the front of the<br>
cavity 170, and step 22 provides for lowering the cover 112 to close the upper portion of<br>
the cavity 170.<br>
Servicing of components disposed within the tower cavity 160 may be<br>
accomplished by the method provided in Figure 3d. The process commences with step 30,<br>
wherein the operator removes the splash plate 145 to gain access to the tower cavity 160.<br>
The use of magnets as the restraint features 146 in the securing of the splash plate 145 to<br>
the tower 143 provides an easily removable and replaceable access solution. Step 32<br>
provides for replacing or servicing any failed components, and step 34 provides for<br>
replacing the splash plate 145 to close out the tower cavity 160.<br>
In a second embodiment, the beverage dispenser 100 is utilized as a master in a<br>
master/slave beverage dispenser setup, and accordingly, like parts have been identified<br>
13<br><br>
with like numerals. As shown in Figure 4, at least one beverage dispenser 101, of virtually<br>
identical construction to the beverage dispenser 100, may be placed adjacent to the<br>
beverage dispenser 100 to form a beverage dispenser 300. The beverage dispenser 101 is<br>
identical to the beverage dispenser 100, except that the beverage dispensers 101 do not<br>
include a control board 272 or the board mounting plate 214. In this configuration, the<br>
beverage dispensers 101 also include an extended control harness 305 that connects to a<br>
next available communication port, illustratively the second communication port 285 on<br>
the control board 272 of the beverage dispenser 100. Accordingly, a third beverage<br>
dispenser 101 including an extended communication harness 306 connects to the third<br>
communication port 286 on the control board 272. Once the desired slave beverage<br>
dispensers 101 are connected, the controller 273 of the beverage dispenser 100 may<br>
conduct any operations other than dispensing routines for the master and the slave<br>
beverage dispensers, 100 and 101 respectively. The controller 273 may then also conduct<br>
global lighting routines between the master and slave beverage dispensers 100 and 101.<br>
Accordingly, the beverage dispenser 300 is modular, such that virtually any number of<br>
slave beverage dispensers 101 may be utilized if a communication port is available on the<br>
control board 272.<br>
In a third embodiment, the beverage dispensers 100 and 300 of the first and second<br>
embodiments may be modified to further include a second beverage nozzle, thereby<br>
providing simultaneous dispensing capability. In this third embodiment, the beverage<br>
dispensers 100 and 300 are virtually identical in form, and accordingly, like parts have<br>
been numbered with like numerals. A beverage dispenser 400 is identical to the beverage<br>
dispenser 100, except that the beverage dispenser 400 includes an additional multi-flavor<br>
beverage dispensing nozzle 135 to provide dual dispensing points. One of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will recognize that various modifications must be made to a beverage dispenser 100<br>
when moving from a single dispense point to dual dispense points, and that dual dispense<br>
points may provide an additional level of flexibility in the beverage dispenser 400. One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will further recognize that the advantages and methods associated<br>
with the first and second embodiments are not hindered by the addition of a second<br>
dispense point, and that a beverage dispenser 400 having dual dispense points may be<br>
utilized in place of the beverage dispenser 100, as well as the beverage dispensers 101.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of the foregoing<br>
preferred embodiment, such description has been for exemplary purposes only and, as will<br>
be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, many alternatives, equivalents, and<br>
14<br><br>
