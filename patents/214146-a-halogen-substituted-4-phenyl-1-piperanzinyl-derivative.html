Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of halogen substituted 4-phenyl-l-piperaziny!, 5    -piperidinyl and -tetrahydropyridyl derivatives having affinity for dopamine D4 receptors and D3 receptors. The compounds of the invention are considered useful in the treatment of certain psyciiiatric and neurologic disorders, including psychosis.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
10<br>
us patent No. 3.188.313 relates to certain 1-(1-, 2-, and 3-indolylalkyl)piperazines, which are said to have CNS depressant and tranqmllising effect.<br>
Other coEQpounds related to the compounds of the invention, which are said to interact with 15    the dopamine and/or the serotonin system, are known in the art.<br>
Thus, EP-B1-496 222, claims compounds having the formula<br><br>
20 wherein Ar is a phenyl group, which may be substituted with halogen, alkyl, cyano, hydroxy etc. and Ind is 3-indolyl, which may be substituted with cyano, aminocaibonyl and aminocaxbonylamino. The compounds disclosed in EP-B 1-496 222 are said to be serotonine antagonists and agonists. It is also mentioned that the compounds have effect on dopamine accumulation in striatum and 5-HTP accumultation in N. Raphe. The compounds are said to<br>
25    be useful as anxiolytica, antidepressiva, neuroleptica and antihypertonica.<br>
WO 99/09025 claims certain 2-(4-aiyl-pipera2rn-l-yl)methyl-lir-indole derivatives.   The compounds are said to be dopamine D4 receptor agonists.   Further, WO 94/24105 relates to 2-(2-(4-aryl-piperazin-l-yl)ethyl-LH"-indole derivatives, which are said to have selective 30    affinity for the dopamine D4 receptor subtype.<br><br>
EP-Bl-354 094 relates to certain oxindoles navmg me lormula<br><br>
wherein R1 is hydrogen, halogen or alkyl, R2 is hydrogen or alkyl, R2 is hydrogen, alkyl or -S-alkyl and Ar may be chlorophenyl and other substituted aryl groups. The compounds bind 5    to the 5-HT1A receptor and are said to be agonists, partial agonists or antagonists at this receptor. Certain of the compounds are said to possess activity at S-HT2 receptors.<br>
WO 98/08816 also describes oxindoles, which are said to be psychotropic drugs, and the application contains data showing the activity of certain of the compounds at the D4 receptor.<br>
Pharmazie, 1997, 52, 423-428 describes N-[3-(4-aryl-l-piperazinyl)alkyl] derivatives of 10 indolin-2(lH)-one, quinolin-2(lH)-one and isoquinolin-l(2fl)-one and their receptor aflSnities at the 5-HTIA and the S-HTIA receptor. The compound l-{3-(4-phenyl-l-piperazinyl)propyl)indolin-2(lif)-one is described as a S-HTZA antagonist with weak 5-HTIA agonistic properties. The compound is suggested as a potential antidepressant and/or anxiolytic agent 15<br>
Subramanian  et al.. Heterocyclic Commimications 1999,  5,   63-68  describes  certain piperazinyl indolyl propanones claimed to show antagonism at dopamine D1/D2 receptors.<br>
Further, Bottcher et al., J. Med Chem. 1992, 35, 4020-4026. describes certain 3-(l,2,3,6-20    tetrahydro-1 -pyridylalkyl)indoles having dopaminergic activity.<br>
Fmally, Pol. J. Pharmacol Pharm. 1984, 36, 697-703 describes the confound l-(3-(4-(3-chlorophenyl)-l-piperazinyl)propyl)indane as having serotinolytic properties.<br>
25    Dopamine D4 receptors belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors, which is<br>
considered to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics. The side effects of<br><br><br>

R1 and R2 are independently selected from hydrogen and halogen provided that at least one of R1 andR2 is a halogen atom;<br>
R3 is selected from hydrogen, halogen, C1-6-alkyl, C2-6-alkenyl, C2-6-alkynyl, 10    trifluoromethyl, C1-6-alkoxy, aiyloxy, aralkoxy, hydroxy, amino, C1-6-alkylamino, di(C1-6-alkyl)amino, nitro and cyano<br>

R4R5R6R7R8andR9 are independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, C1-6-alkyl, C2-6-alkenyl, C2-«-alkynyl, C1-6-alkoxy, C1-6-alkylthio, C1-6-alkylsulfonyl, hydroxy, hydroxy-C1-6 alkyl, amino, C1-6-alkylamino, di(C1-6-alkyl)amino, acyl, aminocarbonyl,C1-6-alkylaminocarbonyl and<br><br>
neuroleptic drugs, which primarily exert their effect via antagonism of D2 receptors, are known to be due to D2 receptor antagonism in the striatal regions of the brain. However, dopamine D4 receptors are primarily located in areas of the brain other than striatum, suggesting that antagonists of the dopamine D4 receptor will be devoid of extrapyramidal    side effects. This is illustrated by the antipsychotic clozapine, which exerts higher affinity for D4 than D2 receptors, and is lacking extrapyramidal side effects (Van Tol et al. Nature 1991,350,610; Hadley Medicinal Research Reviews 1996,16, 507-526 and Sanner Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998,8, 383-393).<br>
   A number of D4 ligands, which were postulated to be selective D4 receptor antagonists (L-745,879 and U-101958) have been shown to posses antipsychotic potential (Mansbach et al. Psychopharmacology 1998,135,194-200). However, recently is has been reported that these compoimds are partial D4 receptor agonists in various in vitro efficacy assays (Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998,124, 889-896 and Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999,128, 613-620).<br>
    Furthermore, it was shown that clozapine, which is an effective antipsychotic, is a silent antagonists (Gazi et al. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999,128, 613-620).<br>
Consequently, D4 ligands, which are partial D4 receptor agonists or antagonists, may have beneficial effects against psychoses. <br>
Dopamine D4 antagonists may also be useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits (Jentsch et al. Psychopharmacology 1999,142, 78-84.<br>
It has also been suggested that dopamine D4 antagonists may be useful to reduce dyskinesia    occurring as a result of the treatment of Parkinson"s disease with L-dopa (Tahar et al. Etir. J. Pharmacol. 2000,399,183-186).<br>
Dopamine D3 receptors also belong to the dopamine D2 subfamily of receptors, and they are preferentially located in limbic regions of the brain (Sokoloff et al. Nature 1990, 347, 146- 151), such as the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine receptor blockade has been associated with antipsychotic activity (Willner Int. Clinical Psychopharmacology 1997,12, 297-308). Furthermore, an elevation of the level of D3 receptors in the limbic part of schizophrenic brains has been reported (Gurevich et al. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 1997,54,225-32). Therefore, D3 receptor antagonists may offer the potential for an effective antipsychotic<br><br>
therapy, free of the extrapyramidal side effects of the classical antipsychotic drugs, which primarily exert their effect by blockade of D2 receptors (Shafer et al. Psychopharmacology 1998,135,1-16; Schwartz et al. Brain Research Reviews 2000, 31,277-287).<br>
 Moreover, D3 receptor blockade results in a slight stimulation in the prefrontal cortex (Merchant et al. Cerebral Cortex 1996, 6, 561-570), which could be beneficial against negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. In addition, dopamine D3 antagonists can reverse D2 antagonist-induced EPS (Millan et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 321, R7-R9) and do not cause changes in prolactin (Reavill et al. J.  Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2000, 294, 1154-1165). Consequently, D3 antagonistic properties of an antipsychotic drug could reduce the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits and result in an improved side effect profile with respect to EPS and hormonal changes.<br>
1<br>
Dopamine D3 agonists have also been considered relevant in the treatment of schizophrenia    (Wustow et al. Current Pharmaceutical Design 1997, 3, 391-404).<br>
According to the present invention, a novel class of dopamine D4 receptor ligands is provided. Most of the compoxmds of the invention also have high affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor and as mentioned above, dopamine D3 antagonistic properties of an  antipsychotic drug may reduce the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and result in an improved side effect profile.<br>
Moreover, certain of the compounds of the invention have the further advantage of having only very weak effect at adrenergic alpha-1-receptors which imply a low propensity to cause     orthostatic hypotension.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to the novel compounds of formula I <br><br>

5 <br>
wherein R , R , R , n, X and Q are as previously defined, whereupon the compoimd of formula I is isolated as the firee base or an acid addition salt thereof.<br>
The reduction according to method a) is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent 10    such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of alane or lithimn aluminium hydride firom 0 °C to reflux temperature. Method b) may be used to prepare starting materials of formula III.<br>
The alkylation according to method b) is conveniently performed in an inert organic solvent 15 such as a suitably boiling alcohol or ketone, preferably in the presence of an organic or inorganic base (potassium carbonate, diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine) at reflux temperature. Alternatively, the alkylation can be perfonned at a fixed temperature, which is different firom the boiling point, in one of the above-mentioned solvents or in dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or A""-methylpyirolidin-2-one (NMP), 20    preferably in the presence of a base.<br>
Amines of formula IV are either commercially available or known from the literature (e.g. Oshiro et al. /. Med. Chem. 1991,34,2014-2023, Oshiro et al. J. Med. Chem. 1998,41, 658-667, and Oshiro et al. J. Med. Chem. 2000,43,177-189). Alkylating reagents of formula V 25    are known firom the Hterature, or they can be prepared by methods obvious to a chemist skilled in the art by an analogues synthetic sequence. Thus, key intermediates such as halo-(2,3-dihydro-l/r-indol-l-yl)alkan-l-one are prepared by addition of a haloalkanoyl chloride to a 2,3-dihydro-lif-indole in the presence of base. Similarly, halo-(3,4-dihydro-liZ-isoquinolin-2-yl)alkan-l-one may be prepared firom a haloalkanoyl chloride and a 3,4-<br><br>
dihydro-lH-isoquinoline. The 2,3-(3ihydro-liy-mdoIes are either commercially available or prepared from the corresponding lif-indoles by reduction of the li7-indole with e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride in acetic acid or in trifluoroacetic acid whereas the 3,4-dihydro-liir-isoquinolines are commercially available or described in the Hterature. Alkylating haloalkyl-5    liif-indoles were prepared by literature methods (Benghiat et al. /. Med. Chem. 1983,26, 1470-1477) or analogues to methods described in the literature (Brodfiiehrer et al. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62,9192 and WO 00/35872). Alkylating 3-haloaIkylindanes or other types of alkylating alky lindanes can be prepared from known indanylalkancarboxylic acids (Mukhopadhyay et al. J. Indian Chem. Soc. 1985, 62, 690-692 and Tanaka et al. /. Med. 10    Chem. 1994, S7,2071-2078) by well known procedures. Alkylating l-(haloalkyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(l/0-one can be prepared as described in EP-B1-512525.<br>
The reductive alkylation according to methods c) and e) can be performed in two steps, e.g. coupling of amines of formula VLTI" with reagent of formula VII/IX by standard methods<br>
15 via the carboxylic acid chloride, activated esters or by use of carboxylic acids in combination with coupling reagents such as e.g. dicyclohexyl carbodiimide followed by reduction of the resulting amide with lithium aluminium hydride or alane. The reaction can also be performed by a standard one-pot procedure, e.g. by the use of reductive amination of amines of formula VI/II with aldehydes of formula VII/TX. Caiboxylic acids or aldehydes of<br>
20 formula VII are either commercially available or described in the literature. Thus, key intermediates have been described in the hterature such as indanylalkancarboxylic acids (Mukhopadhyay et al.

Melting points were determined on a Buchi B-535 apparatus and are imcorrected. Mass spectra were obtained on a Quattro MS-MS system from VG Biotech, Fisons Instnmients or on a Sciex API 150EX from Perldn Elmer. Spectra were obtained at two sets of operating conditions by the use of either electrospray ionisation or ACPI: one set to obtain moleciilar<br>
25    weight information and the other set to induce fragmentation patterns. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 250.13 MHz on a Bruker AC 250 or at 500.13 MHz on a Bruker DRX 500. Deuterated chloroform (99.8% D) or dimethylsulfoxide (99.9% D) were used as solvents. T^IS was used as internal reference standard. Chemical shifts are expressed as ppm values. The following abbreviations are used for multipHcity of NMR signals: s=singlet, d=doublet,<br>
