				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BLOCK COPOLYMER FOR DRUG CONJUGATES AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention provides a block copolymer for a drug conjugate that permits an excellent retention of the conjugate in the blood. BACKGROUND ART<br>
When a drug is systemically administered to an individual orally or by intravenous injection, etc., side effects may be recognized at normal tissues other than the focal lesions to be targeted, which may force the modification and/or suspension of the therapeutic regimen.  Also for some drugs, it may be difficult to maintain the effective drug concentration, or some may be metabolized before being delivered to the target site.<br>
In order to resolve these problems, active research is currently underway on technologies that will have introduced advanced pharmaceutical methods and concepts in which the control of the pharmacokinetics or selective delivery of a drug in the body leads to the desired drug concentration/time pattern at the action site of interest in order to optimize the therapeutic effect.  These technologies and concepts are referred to as the drug delivery system (DDS), and in recent years growing importance has been recognized in that they permit the safer and more effective delivery of anti-cancer drugs, DNA, peptides etc. to pathological lesions such as tumor sites and inflammatory sites.<br>
As specific means of DDS, a method that employs liposomes, emulsions, or nanoparticles as the drug carrier, a method in which drugs are incorporated in polymer carriers such as polymeric micelles, a method in which drugs are covalently bound to synthetic polymers or naturally occurring polysaccharides, and the like have been developed.  In attempts to put these systems into<br>
practical use, there are various problems to be solved, and, among them, evasion from the biological mechanism of recognizing foreign objects, the containment of a drug at a high concentration in a DDS drug carrier, and the control of the release rate of a drug are posing serious challenges.<br>
With regard to evasion from the biological mechanism of recognizing foreign objects, it is becoming possible to avoid the capture at the reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the liver, the spleen etc. by enhancing drug stability in the blood by coating the surface of a drug carrier such as liposomes with a hydrophilic polymer such as polyethylene glycol thereby preventing the adhesion of serum proteins, opsonin proteins etc.  As a result, the high retention of liposomes and polymeric micelles in the blood circulation after intravenous administration can be obtained, and they have come to be passively accumulated in such tissues as the tumor tissues and inflammatory sites in which vascular permeability has been enhanced, thereby leading to efficient treatment.<br>
On the other hand, with reference to the content of a drug in DDS drug carriers, a high drug content can reduce the amount of the carrier required to deliver the desired drug, which is advantageous in terms of both therapeutic effects and drug design [J. Med. Chem. 45: 4336-4343 (2002)].  Nevertheless, with regard to liposomes and polymeric micelles, the content of drugs is limited due to a poor physical stability thereof, and with regard to the polymer conjugate type, increases in drug content can affect the properties of water-soluble polymers, thereby reducing water solubility.  As a result, their interaction with plasma components can no longer be controlled, retention of the conjugate in the blood circulation becomes impossible, and in most cases the drug content therein is as low as several percents [CRIPS 5(2): 2-8 (2004)].  Thus, it is impossible at present to attain a high drug content and an excellent<br>
retention in the blood at the same time.<br>
For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2003-34653 discloses a DDS compound which has been optimized and of which therapeutic range has been substantially expanded by a specific means for optimizing DDS, and describes that DDS compounds that make use of characteristics of each anti-cancer drug can be generated by selecting the sequence of a peptide linker for conjugating the drug and a carrier and the structure of the carrier.  However, the content of anti-cancer drugs is merely about 1-10 % relative to the total weight of the DDS compound.<br>
With regard to the release of a drug, an ideal system in terms of reduced side effects and enhanced therapeutic effects is such that the drug is stably encapsulated in or bound to the carrier in the blood and, after reaching the lesional tissue, the drug is quickly released.<br>
For example, Japanese patent No. 3270592, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 7-69900, and W097/12895 disclosed pharmaceutical preparations of block copolymer-anthracycline anti-cancer drug.  The drug has been encapsulated by physicochemical bonding or an amide bond utilizing the amino acid group of the drug and the carboxyl group of the block copolymer.  Thus, the drug has been bound to the carrier and stabilized, but it is hardly conceivable to be quickly released after reaching the pathological tissue.<br>
In order to highly realize the control of drug release, various environment-responsive carriers are being investigated, i.e. pharmaceutical carriers of which properties change in response to environmental changes resulting from diseases, or to differences in the environment of the normal tissue and the focal lesions.<br>
For example, there has been reported HPMA copolymer-doxorubicin (PK1) in which doxorubicin has been bound to a HPMA polymer with a molecular weight of about 30,000<br>
dalton via a GFLG spacer.  In PK1, the drug is released by cathepsin B that is more expressed at tumor sites than at the normal tissues, and the drug content is 8.5%, i.e. it has not attained high drug content.<br>
On the other hand, investigations are being made to attain the release of drugs in response to environmental changes due to pH changes at pathological lesions such as tumor sites and inflammatory sites by utilizing the fact that local pH at these affected regions is lower than at the normal tissues [Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 56: 1023-1050 (2004), Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1329(2): 291-301 (1997)].<br>
An intracellular low-pH environment-responsive polymer conjugate [J. Controlled Release 87: 33-47 (2003)] and polymeric micelles [Bioconjugate Chem. 16: 122-130 (2005)] that release doxorubicin hydrochloride precisely in response to the low-pH environment in the endosome after the drug was incorporated into individual cancerous cells at local tumors via the endocytosis route have been reported.  For this polymeric micelles, specifically, the pH dependence of drug release and a relatively high drug content have been attained.<br>
The present inventors have found, however, that the increase in the amount of the drug in said polymeric micelles leads to reduced drug retention in the blood, and thus after intensive and extensive research, the present inventors have attained a high drug content and succeeded in enhancing retention in the blood.

The block copolymer for a drug conjugate of the present invention may be prepared by introducing a hydrazide group and a hydrophobic group into a block copolymer comprising a water-soluble polymer region consisting of polyethylene glycol and a polyamino acid region.<br>
As the polyamino acid region, there can be mentioned, but not limited to, poly(amino acid derivatives) such as poly(aspartic acid) and/or a derivative thereof, poly(glutamic acid) and/or a derivative thereof, for example poly(p-alkylaspartate-co-aspartic acid), poly(p-allylaspartate-co-aspartic acid), poly(P-aralkylaspartate-co-aspartic acid), poly(y-alkylglutamate-co-glutamic acid), poly (y-aralkylglutamate-co-glutamic acid), poly(P-alkylaspartamide-co-aspartic acid), poly (y-aralkylglutamide-co-glutamic acid), poly ((5-benzyl-co-L-aspartate) and poly (y-benzyl-co-L-glutamate) , and the like.<br>
Specifically, as the block copolymer that is easy to manufacture and that can be conveniently used in the present invention, those represented by the following formulae (I) and (II) may be mentioned:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein<br>
R1, which may be the same or different, represents a hydrogen atom, a methoxy group, a methyl group, or a substituted linear or branched or cyclic C1-C12 alkyl group, in which the substituent represents a functional group selected from the group consisting of a maleimide group, an amino group, a carboxyl group, a thiol group, a hydroxy group and an active ester group which may be protected,<br>

L1 and L2 independently from each other represents a linker,<br>
m represents an integer of 5-1000, preferably 40-600 n represents an integer of 0-1000, preferably 0-100 p represents an integer of 1-1000, preferably 1-100, and<br>
q represents an integer of 1-1000, preferably 1-100, provided that when p accounts for 20% or more to less than 90%, preferably 25% or more to 50% or less of<br>
the total units of the polyamino acids in the block copolymer and n is present, then n, p, and q are randomly present, and when n is absent, then p and q are randomly present, and y represents an integer of 1 or 2.<br>
The linker, which may vary depending on the method of producing the block copolymer, is not specifically limited, and L1 includes, for example, -Z-NH-, -CO-Z-NH-, and -CO-NH-Z-NH- in which Z is independently a C1-C8 alkyl group, and L2 includes, for example, -CO-Z-, -Z-CO-, -C0-Z-CO-, -Z-CO-Z-, and -Z-CO-O-Z- in which Z is independently a C1-C8 alkyl group.<br>
The above block copolymer may be synthesized by reacting hydrazine or a hydrazine hydrate to a known MeO-PEG (p-benzyl-L-aspartate) thereby to convert the benzylester moiety to a hydrazide group.  The reaction is usually conducted in a dehydrated solvent.  Preferred solvents are aliphatic or aromatic organic solvents and those that can dissolve any of the block copolymer and hydrazine or the hydrazine hydrate.  As the solvent, for example, there can be preferably used N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, or a mixed solvent thereof.  The solvent used preferably doesn't contain water as much as possible.<br>
The amount added of hydrazine during synthesis may be the amount that is desired to be introduced into the benzylester moiety of the block copolymer since the reaction proceeds in an almost quantitative manner. When hydrazine is used, for example, when 50% is to be introduced into the benzylester moiety, 0.5-fold equivalent of hydrazine is added, and when 75% is to be introduced into the benzylester moiety, 0.75-fold equivalent of hydrazine is added.  The reaction is conducted at a temperature range of 0°C to 100°C, preferably 20°C to 80°C, and more preferably 25°C to 50°C. The pressure is preferably normal pressure.  The reaction<br>
time is not specifically limited as long as the reaction fully proceeds, and it is usually two hours to two days.<br>
The drug that can be conjugated to the block copolymer for a drug conjugate of the present invention is not specifically limited, as long as it can form a covalent bond by reacting with a hydrazide group. Preferred examples of such a drug includes, for example, a drug that has a ketone structure, for example an anthracycline anti-cancer drug.  Specific examples of anthracycline anti-cancer drugs include, for example, doxorubicin hydrochloride, daunorubicin hydrochloride, epirubicin hydrochloride, pirarubicin, idarubicin hydrochloride, amrubicin hydrochloride, nemorubicin, PNU-159682 and the like.  The amount of the drug to be conjugated to said block copolymer is not specifically limited as long as retention in the blood can be maintained, and is 10% or more to 50% or less relative to the total units of polyamino acids in the block copolymer, preferably 10% or more to 40% or less, and, considering the efficacy and stability of the drug, most preferably 15% or less to 35% or less.  Whereas there are plurality of ketones in the above anthracycline anticancer drugs, about 13 ketones bind covalently to the hydrazide group.<br>
The binding of the above drug to the copolymer for a drug conjugate of the present invention may be preferably accomplished by simply reacting the drug to the hydrazide group of the block copolymer as much as possible under an anhydrous condition.  Preferably the block copolymer of the present invention may be dissolved in a dehydrated solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, or a mixed solvent thereof, to which the drug at the desired amount may be added and reacted at 0.1 to 10 equivalents, preferably 0.1 to 3 equivalent, relative to the hydrazide group.  The reaction may be conducted at a temperature range of 0°C to 50°C, preferably 20°C to<br>
40°C, and more preferably 25°C to 37°C.  The pressure is preferably normal pressure.  The reaction time is not specifically limited as long as the reaction fully proceeds, and it will usually be two hours to two days. The solution after the reaction may be poured into an appropriate hydrophilic organic solvent, for example an alcohol such as 2-propanol, and the precipitate formed may be washed and collected.  The collection may be performed by a centrifugation procedure.  If necessary, the drug-conjugate copolymer may be subjected to purification by gel filtration chromatography or ultrafiltration to remove the unbound drug.<br>

An amount between 10-20 mg each of 4 different polymers (8, 15, 20, and 39 DOX) was weighed accurately into a sample vial, to which 1 ml of dichloromethane was added to completely dissolve the polymer.  Then, under the stream of nitrogen, the solvent was evaporated to prepare the polymer in the film form.  Under reduced pressure, it was further dried at room temperature for 1 hour, and then 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)/5%(w/v) glucose was added to a polymer concentration of 10 mg/ml to hydrate the polymer film at 4°C.  After stirring overnight at 4°C, it was subjected to µltrasonic treatment in ice chilled water for 10 minutes using the Biodisruptor (Nihonseiki Kaisha Ltd., High Power Unit). Subsequently, it was filtered with a 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, Millex™ GP PES) to prepare polymeric micelles of the filtrate, which were used in the subsequent experiment.<br>

after intravenous administration are shown in Fig. 2, and AUC calcµlated based on the resµlt of this determination is summarized in Table 1.  Whereas the 39 and 20 DOX-polymer conjugates rapidly disappear, the 15 and 8 DOX-polymer conjugates exhibited relatively persistent retention in the plasma.  AUC of the 39, 20, 15, and 8 DOX-polymer conjugates was 1.2, 3.1, 7.6, and 19.1 µg/ml.h, respectively.  However, it was 1/10 or less when compared to AUC obtained in Example 1. Comparative Example 9 Preparation of MeO-PEG-pAsp (amide-DOX) micelles<br>
An amount between 10-20 mg of the polymer MeO-PEG-pAsp (amide-DOX) obtained in Comparative Example 4 was weighed accurately into a sample vial, to which 1 ml of dichloromethane was added to completely dissolve the polymer.

After stirring overnight at 4°C, it was subjected to µltrasonic treatment in ice chilled water for 10 minutes using the Biodisruptor (Nihonseiki Kaisha Ltd., High Power Unit).  Subsequently, it was gel-filtered (PD-10 column, GE Healthcare Bioscience, eluent: 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)/5%(w/v) glucose) to remove free DOX in the sample, and the collected polymer fraction was used as the polymeric micelles. Comparative Example 10 Preparation of DOX-encapsµlating liposomes<br>

a molar ratio of HPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG=2:1:0.1 were prepared. Thus, from the lipid chloroform stock solution, a film of the above composition was prepared under the stream of nitrogen.  It was dried overnight under reduced pressure, and then 250 mM (NH4)2SO4 aqueous solution was added thereto and hydrated at 60°C.  After ulstrasonic radiation (5 minutes) at 60°C, it was subjected to a 0.1 µm  filter treatment with Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) at 60°C for 11 times.  Subsequently, liposomes were collected by µltracentrifugation (65,000 rpm, 1 hour, 20°C, Beckman Coµlter, MLA-130 rotor), and were suspended in a 5% glucose aqueous solution.  To the collected empty liposomes, a DOX solution (5%(w/v) glucose) was added (lipid : DOX =1 : 0.2 w/w), and incubated at 65°C for 2 hours.  Subsequently, in order to remove DOX that were not encapsµlated into liposomes, a similar µltracentrifugation procedure (65,000 rpm, one hour, 20°C, Beckman Coµlter, MLA-130 rotor) was followed to obtain liposome as the precipitate.  Furthermore, they were purified (eluent: 5%(w/v) glucose) by gel filtration (PD-10, GE Healthcare Bioscience), and the collected liposome fraction was used as a sample to be administered to rats. Comparative Example 11<br>
Preparation of DOX-encapsµlating physically-adsorbed micelles Synthesis of MeO-PEG-PBLA(12-40 Bn60%)<br>
In  argon atmosphere, 1 g (0.059 mmol) of MeO-PEG-pAsp (COOH) obtained in Comparative Example 3 was dissolved in 20 ml of dehydrated DMF, to which 244 µl (2.36 mmol) of benzyl alcohol, 1-fold equivalent relative to the carboxylic acid (40 equivalents relative to the block copolymer), 288 mg (2.36 mmol) of 4-dimethylamno pyridine DMAP, Mw = 122.17), 1-fold equivalent relative to the carboxylic acid (40 equivalents relative to the block copolymer), and 548 µ  (3.54 mmol) of diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIPCI, Mw = 126.2, d: 0.815), 1.5-fold<br>
equivalent relative to the carboxylic acid (60 equivalents relative to the block copolymer), were added, and allowed to react overnight at room temperature. After the reaction the solution was added dropwise to 200 ml of a hexane/ethyl acetate (1/1) mixed solution to precipitate a polymer, which was then filtered with a Kiriyama filter paper ( 45 mm, 5B) .   Furthermore, the polymer was washed twice with 200 ml of a clean hexane/ethyl acetate (1/1) mixed solution to obtain a polymer powder.<br>
The polymer obtained was dispersed in 100 ml of water and then was subjected to µltrafiltration (Millipore, Laboscale TFF System (UF membrane: attached to Pellicon™ XL Biomax5)), followed by filtration (Millipore Strivex™ GS, 0.22 µ) , and then lyophilized. Subsequently, it was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF, and added dropwise to 200 ml of a hexane/ethyl acetate (1/1) mixed solution to precipitate a polymer.  It was further filtered with Kiriyama filter paper ( 45mm, 5B) . Furthermore, the polymer was washed twice with 200 ml of a clean hexane/ethyl acetate (1/1) mixed solution and dried under reduced pressure to obtain a polymer powder.<br>
The polymer obtained was confirmed under a same condition as Example 1, and the resµlt of GPC demonstrated that the polymer had a molecµlar weight Mp = 19500 Da and a molecµlar weight distribution of Mw/Mn = 1.08.  The introduction of benzyl groups calcµlated from 1-NMR was 25 molecµles, and the rate of introduction calcµlated from MeO-PEG-PBLA (12-40) obtained in Example 1 was 63%.<br>
About 10 mg of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Wako) was accurately weighed, to which DMSO (Wako) was added to 10 mg/ml and dissolved.  2-fold moles (about 5 µl) of triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) relative to doxorubicin hydrochloride was added thereto, which was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.  On the other hand,<br>
as the polymer PEG-PBLA (60%Bn) (12-40) was used.  About 20 mg of the polymer was accurately weighed, to which DMSO (Wako) was added and dissolved to 10 mg/ml.  To the mixture, 0.4 ml of a doxorubicin hydrochloride solution in DMSO prepared above was added (polymer : DOX = 1 : 0.2 w/w), and this mixture was placed in a dialysis membrane tube (Spectra/Por™) with a molecµlar weight cut off(MWCO) 3,500, and dialyzed overnight against 300 ml of 20 mM borate buffer (pH 8.0) at 4°C.  The content of the dialysis membrane tube was collected, and was subjected to µltrasonication in ice chilled water for 5 minutes using the Biodisruptor (Nihonseiki Kaisha Ltd., High Power Unit).  Subsequently, it was filtered with a 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, Millex™ GP PES), and then gel filtrated (PD-10 column, GE Healthcare Bioscience, eluent: 5%(w/v) glucose) to remove free DOX in the sample.  The fraction collected were polymeric micelles DOX-encapsµlating physically entrapped, and were used in the subsequent experiment. Comparative Example 12 Preparation of a DOX solution<br>
About 10 mg of doxorubicin hydrochloride (Wako) was accurately weighed, to which a 5%(w/v) glucose aqueous solution was added to dissolve the drug completely to a concentration of 2 mg/ml, and used in the animal experiment.<br>
Comparative Example 13 A PK study of Comparative Examples 1) A rat administration study<br>
To male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., 6-7 weeks old) under ether anesthesia, the DOX preparations of the above Comparative Examples 7, and 9-12 were administered into the tail vein at 1 mg/kg (5 mg/kg for Comparative Example 12) in terms of the amount of DOX (n=3).  After centrifuging the collected blood at 4°C, plasma was collected and stored at -30°C until use.<br>
Dose: 1 mg/kg in terms of the amount of DOX (5 mg/kg for Comparative Example 12)<br>
Blood drawing timing: 5 minutes, 1, 3, 6, 9, 24, 48 hours after administration<br>
Amount of blood drawn: 0.2-0.25 ml each time (from the jugµlar vein)<br>
The blood collected was centrifuged at 4°C to collect<br>
plasma, which was stored at -30°C until use. 2) Determination of DOX concentration<br>
For Comparative Example 7, DOX concentration in the plasma was determined as in Example 8, and for the other Comparative Examples, the following method was used.<br>
(1)	In the case of liposomes<br>
To 40 µl of rat plasma collected, 40 µ1 of acetonitrile was added and stirred, to which 40 µl of a 1% Triton X-100 aqueous solution was added.  After centrifuging (Funakoshi, Tibitan, 10,000 rpm, 10 minutes) at room temperature, 80 µl  of the supernatant was collected, to which 20 µ1 of 10 µg/ml  of daunorubicin hydrochloride (Wako) to be used as an internal standard / 25 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.0) was added.  The DOX concentration was determined using Waters Alliance System under the condition described in Example 8.<br>
(2)	In the case of MeO-PEG-pAsp (Amide-DOX)<br>
To 50 µl  of rat plasma collected, 50 µl  of 1N HCl was added to a total of 100 µl, and after stirring, it was warmed to 85°C for 20 minutes.  In a preliminary experiment, however, it had been confirmed that 100% of doxorubicin can be converted to related compounds.  After the sample was cooled to room temperature, 100 µl  of acetonitrile, 50 µl of doxorubicin hydrochloride to be used as an internal standard / 1 M borate buffer (pH 8.0), and 50 µl of 1N NaOH were sequentially added and stirred.  Subsequently, it was centrifuged (Funakoshi, Chibitan, 10,000 rpm, 10 minutes) at room temperature to<br>
collect 100 µl of the supernatant, which was filtered<br>
with a 0.22 µm filter (Millipore, Millex™ GP PES), and<br>
the filtrate was analyzed by HPLC.  Using a calibration<br>
curve generated by treating an aqueous DOX solution in a<br>
similar manner, DOX concentration in the plasma was<br>
determined.<br>
(3) In the case of the DOX solution<br>
It was determined according to the method of determining free DOX concentration described in Example 8.<br>
3) Resµlt of determination of changes with time in plasma levels<br>
The resµlt of time-courses of the concentration of each DOX preparation in the plasma is shown in Fig. 3, and AUC calcµlated based on the resµlt of this determination is summarized in Table 1.  Compared to the resµlt of the solution, an increase in AUC due to physically-entrapped polymeric micelles was 7 fold. On the other hand, in the DOX conjugate (Comparative Example 7) having an ammonium salt and a DOX-polymer conjugate (Comparative Example 9) using the amide bond, AUC increased by about 500 fold, which was however about 1/4 that of Example 5.  In liposome (Comparative Example 10), the increase was about 2000 fold, giving AUC almost comparable to Example 5.<br>

Effect of the addition of a polymer having a hydrophobic<br>
group<br>
1) Preparation of mixed micelles<br>
MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX) (Comparative Example 6) containing 39 molecµles of DOX in one polymer was used. An amount between 10-20 mg each of this conjugate and PEG-PBLA (60% Bn) (12-4 0) having a hydrophobic group prepared in Comparative Example 11 was accurately weighed into a sample vial so as to give a weight ratio of 1:1, and then 1 ml of dichloromethane was added thereto to dissolve the polymer completely.  Subsequently, under the stream of nitrogen, the solvent was evaporated to prepare a polymer in the film form.  After it was further dried under reduced pressure at room temperature for 1 hour, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)/5%(w/v) glucose was added to a polymer concentration of 10 mg/ml to hydrate the polymer film at 4°C.  After stirring overnight at 4°C,<br>
it was subjected to µltrasonic treatment in ice chilled water for 10 minutes using the Biodisruptor (Nihonseiki Kaisha Ltd., High Power Unit).  Subsequently, it was filtered with a 0.22 µm  filter (Millipore, Millex™ GP PES) to prepare micelles of the filtrate, which were used in the subsequent experiment. 2) A rat PK study and the resµlt<br>
In a method same as Example 8, the above micelles were intravenously administered to a dose of 1 mg/kg in terms of the amount of DOX.  By determining changes in the concentration in the plasma, AUC was calcµlated to be 12.4 µg/ml.h, indicating an improvement of AUC by about 10-fold as compared to when the DOX-polymer conjugate was only used in preparation (described in Comparative Example 13).  The resµlt demonstrates that by adding a block copolymer having a hydrophobic group, the stability of DOX-polymer conjugate micelles in the blood can be enhanced. Example 11 A study on pH-dependency of drug release<br>
About 10 mg of the polymer obtained in Example 5 was weighed accurately into a sample vial, to which 1 ml of dichloromethane was added to completely dissolve the polymer.  Then, under the stream of nitrogen, the solvent was evaporated to prepare the polymer in the film form. Under reduced pressure, it was further dried at room temperature for 1 hour, and then 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added to a polymer concentration of 10 mg/ml to hydrate the polymer film at 4°C.  After<br>
stirring overnight at 4°C, it was subjected to µltrasonic treatment in ice chilled water for 10 minutes using the Biodisruptor (Nihonseiki Kaisha Ltd., High Power Unit). Subsequently, it was filtered with a 0.22 um filter (Millipore, Millex™ GP PES) to prepare micelles of the filtrate, which were used in the subsequent experiment. To 950 µl of 20 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3),<br>
sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), or sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) previously heated to 37°C, 50 µ1 of the polymeric micelles prepared in the above method were added to initiate a drug release experiment.  At predetermined timing, 50 µ1 of the sample was collected, and instead the liquid amount was replenished with the same buffer, The free DOX concentration in the collected sample was determined by HPLC according to the above-mentioned method.<br>
The resµlt is shown in Fig. 4.  While DOX was rapidly released at pH 3, the release rate decreased as the pH of the liquid becomes neutral to pH 5 to 7.4, thereby confirming the pH dependency. Example 12 A drug efficacy study<br>
Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells subcutaneous transplanted to male nude mice were used as the model for evaluating drug efficacy.<br>
Male nude mice (Balb nu/nu, 5 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. , and human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were purchased from the Human Health Sciences Foundation Resources Bank.  PC-3 cells that had been subcµltured in a CO2 incubator were suspended in physiological saline for injection (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), and were subcutaneously injected into the back of the nude mice to a cell count of 2 x 106/50 µl per animal.  Then, after keeping the nude mice for about 2 weeks, the administration of the drug was started when the mean of tumor volume reached about 50 mm3.  The DOX-polymer conjugates (two regimens: Example 5 and Comparative Example 6) were administered into the tail vein (every 4 days for a total of 3 times), and anti-tumor effect was assessed from tumor volume, and side effects from changes in body weight (8 animals per group).  For comparison, the DOX solution (Comparative Example 12) and the DOX-encapsµlating liposomes<br>
 (Comparative Example 10) were used.  The amount administered of each preparation was MTD (Comparative Examples 6, 10, 12) previously determined using normal healthy mice or 2/3 the amount (Example 5).<br>
Changes in tumor volume and body weight are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.  In the case of the DOX solution (Comparative Example 12), the body weight decreased by a maximum of 17% at the MTD of 5 mg/kg and the effect of inhibiting tumor growth was T/C = 0.4 at the maximum [T/C: the ratio of tumor volume of the drug administration group (T) to that of the control group (C)].  In the case of liposomes (Comparative Example 10), a reduction in body weight of 20% or more at the MTD of 5 mg/kg persisted to the end of the experiment, and inhibited tumor growth up to T/C =0.43.  In the case of the DOX-polymer conjugate (Comparative Example 6), body weight decreased by a maximum of 13% at 15 mg/kg, and inhibited tumor up to T/C =0.42.  In Example 5, body weight reduced a maximum of 15% at MTD x 2/3 of 11 mg/kg, whereas it switched and started to increase on day 16 post-administration and after, and exhibited the effect of inhibiting tumor growth up to T/C = 0.32.  The foregoing resµlt indicates that the DOX-polymer conjugate (Example 5) has an excellent anti-tumor effect as compared to the DOX solution or the DOX-encapsµlating liposomes. Example 13 Synthesis of MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd, Bn)<br>
Except that the equivalent ratio of anhydrous hydrazine was changed, the polymer was synthesized based on the synthetic method described in Example 2. Specifically, 79.3 µl (2.5 mmol, Mw = 32.05) of anhydrous hydrazine, 0.25-fold equivalent relative to the benzylester (10 equivalents relative to the block copolymer) in 5 g (0.25 mmol) of MeO-PEG-PBLA (12-40) was added to obtain a powder polymer (MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd, Bn)).  The compound obtained was confirmed to be the<br>
compound of interest by conducting acetylation of the<br>
hydrazide group same as to Example 2, followed by 1H-NMR.<br>
The polyaspartic acid side chain per molecµle of the<br>
polymer had 10 hydrazide groups (q), 26 benzylester<br>
groups (p), and 4 COOH (n).<br>
Example 14<br>
Synthesis of MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX, Bn)<br>
500 mg of MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd, Bn) obtained in Example 13 was dissolved in 5 ml of dehydrated DMSO, to which 2-fold equivalents of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX, MW = 580) relative to the hydrazide group (20 equivalents relative to the block copolymer) was added, and was allowed to react at 37°C, in the dark for 3 days.  After the reaction, it was purified in a same manner as Example 5 to obtain a doxorubicin hydrochloride-polymer conjugate (MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX, Bn)).  The resµlt of HPLC indicated that the amount of doxorubicin hydrochloride per molecµle of the polymer conjugate was 9. Example 15 Synthesis of MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd -EPI, Bn)<br>
Except that doxorubicin hydrochloride was replaced with epirubicin hydrochloride, a method similar to that of Example 14 was followed in which 2-fold equivalents of epirubicin hydrochloride (hereinafter referred to as EPI, MW = 580) relative to the hydrazide group (20 equivalents relative to the block copolymer) was added, and was allowed to react for 3 days to obtain a epirubicin hydrochloride-polymer conjugate (MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd -EPI, Bn)).  The resµlt of determination by HPLC indicated that the amount of epirubicin hydrochloride per molecµle of the polymer conjugate obtained was 9. Example 16<br>
A rat PK study using MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX, Bn) and MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-EPI, Bn)<br>
Using the doxorubicin hydrochloride-polymer conjugate (MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX, Bn)) obtained in Example 14 and the epirubicin hydrochloride-polymer<br>
conjugate (MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-EPI, Bn)) obtained in Example 15, micelles were prepared same as Example 8, and were subjected to a rat PK study.  The measurement of EPI concentration in the plasma was carried out same as the measurement of DOX concentration described in Example 8.<br>
As a resµlt, for MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-DOX, Bn), AUC, when 1 mg/ml in terms of the amount of DOX was given into the tail vein, was 142 µg/ml.h, indicating that this conjugate had an  excellent retention in the blood comparable to Example 8.  For MeO-PEG-pAsp (Hyd-EPI, Bn) as well, AUC, when 1 mg/ml in terms of the amount of EPI was given into the tail vein, was 132 µg/ml.h, also indicating that this also had excellent retention in the blood.<br>
On the other hand, when about 10 mg of epirubicin hydrochloride (Shandong Newtime Pharmaceuticals) was accurately weighed, to which a 5%(w/v) glucose aqueous solution was added and dissolved completely, and 1 mg/kg of it was administered into the tail vein, AUC was 0.04 µg/ml. h.<br>
These time-courses of drug concentration in the plasma after intravenous administration are shown in Fig. 7.  As compared to the epirubicin hydrochloride solution, either polymer conjugate of DOX and EPI exhibited persistent plasma concentration indicating that they had excellent retention in the blood compared to the Comparative Examples.<br>
