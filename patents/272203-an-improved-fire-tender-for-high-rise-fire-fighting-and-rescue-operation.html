FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved fire tender for high rise fire fighting and rescue operation.<br>
In particular, it relates to a hydraulic platform mounted fire tender for multistorey fire fighting and rescue operation in multistoried buildings located on narrow roads and congested areas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fire tenders are available to fight fire with various extinguishing media. Some of these fire tenders are also provided with separate high-rise platforms used for rescue operations along with separate supply of extinguishing media for fire fighting. Such equipment however, cannot enter narrow lanes and operate without hard ground being made available.<br>
 -3-<br>
The hydraulic platform used in known equipment comprises three boorn sections operating with hydraulic cylinders. The booms are rotated on a rotating disk by 360° for reaching the monitor cage to the required height for rescue operation. For fighting fire, supply of extinguishing media can be used from a different / separate source. Thus the prior art hydraulic platform for rescue operation needs a very large area for its operation and as such it cannot enter or operate from a narrow lane.<br>
There was therefore, a need for an improved fire tender which can do high rise fire fighting and rescue work operating in narrow lanes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to provide a fire tender which can enter narrow roads and congested areas for both high rise fire fighting and rescue operation.<br>
<br>
<br>
-4-<br>
This and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a hydraulically operated retractable elevated platform which can rise vertically upto a height of about 27 - 30 feet shooting water / foam under pressure upto a height of three storeys, maintaining the center of gravity.<br>
The unique design of the elevating hydraulic platform mounted on a conventional fire tender operates without disturbing the center of gravity. It is provided with built in pump and storage tank for extinguishing media for fire fighting.<br>
The design allows the fire tender with retracted platform to move into lanes / road where standard elevated systems cannot enter or operate. This hydraulic platform will elevate to a height of approx 27 - 30 feet and shoot the water / foam into the fire even up to three storeys. The height of the elevated platform can further be extended by about 30 ft using an extension ladder. Pressure of water / foam will be of high standards, compared to the old practice of connecting of number of hoses to hydrant connections at the base level. This can also be utilized as a rescue platform.<br>
 -5-<br>
Thus the present invention provides an improved fire-tender for high-rise fire fighting and rescue operation on narrow / congested roads comprising an elevating hydraulic platform mounted on a fire tender characterized in that said fire-tender is provided with a built-in pump and tanks for storing extinguishing media; and in that said elevating platform is capable of being raised vertically to the desired height for fire fighting and rescue operation.<br>

CALCULATIONS FOR THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY<br>
To find out the CG of the fire truck as per the specifications, the truck can be divided into individual masses. We shall find out the individual CG for individual masses.<br>
For all the bodies in consideration, length would be the dimension measured along the wheelbase of the chassis while the width would be the dimension measured along the track of the truck. Weight would be measured in kilograms and distance would be measured in miHimeters. Since all the individual masses in consideration are located centrally width wise, one of the widthwise coordinate of the CG would lie at the center of the track width. The track width for TATA 2518 IS 2260 MM. Hence the width of the masses need not be considered in the calculation of CG.<br>

Since the platform is a rectangular structure in extended and collapsed condition, the position of CG in would be:<br>
{V2 (L), Yi (H)} = (750 X 4000) in extended condition {y2 (L), y2 (H)} = (750 X 650) in collapsed condition<br>
The location is shown in the picture Figure 3 (c)<br>
 -29-<br>
4. Chassis + Cowl (TATA 2518)<br>
wheelbase (distance)	=	4880 mm<br>
bare kerb weight of the chassis	=	6500 kg<br>
front axle weight	=	1650 kg<br>
rear axle weight	=	3850 kg<br>
ratio of weight division (FA: RA)	=	3:7<br>
The weight on truck's front and rear axles is directly proportional to the location of the center of gravity along the truck's wheelbase. It is a direct inverse ratio.<br>
Hence the CG of chassis is located at 70/100 * WB<br>
= 70/100 * 4880= 3420 mm from the center of front axle along the wheelbase.<br>
The position is shown in the picture Figure 3(d).<br>

5. Center of Gravity - Platform Raised to Full Height<br>
To calculate the CG of the whole unit, we shall project the above individual masses on same plate as shown Figure 3(d).<br>
From the above Figure:<br>
mO	=	6500 kg x 0 = 4135 mm<br>
ml	=	1500 kg x 1 = 1500 mm<br>
m2	=	5000 kg x 2 = 3500 mm<br>
m3	=	2500 kg x 3 = 5841 mm<br>
Substituting the values in the above equation, we obtain the position of CG on X-Axis = 3950 mm<br>
 <br>
mO =	6500 kg<br>
mi =	1500 kg<br>
m2 =	5000 kg<br>
m3 =	2500 kg<br>
 yO = 0550 mm yl = 1700 mm y2 = 1700 mm y3 = 5206 mm<br>
 -31-<br>
Substituting the values in the above equation, we obtain the position of CG on Y-<br>
Axis = 1720 mm.<br>
The position of CG (3950,1720) is shown in Figure 3(e).<br>
6. Center of Gravity - Platform in Lowered Condition<br>
To calculate the CG of the whole unit, we shall project the above individual masses on same plane as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Xcm -	S mix,	mjXi + m2x2 + m^<br>
rri|	rrii + tri2 + 1TI3<br>
 From the figure 7:		<br>
mO =	6500	kg<br>
ml =	1500	kg<br>
m2 =	5000	kg<br>
m3 ==	2500	kg<br>
 x 0 = 4135 mm x 1 = 1500 mm x 2 = 3500 mm x 3 = 5841 mm<br>
 -32-<br>
 Substituting the values in the above equation, we obtain the position of CG on X-Axis = 3950 mm<br>
mO =	6500 kg<br>
ml =	1500 kg<br>
m2 =	5000 kg<br>
m3 =	2500 kg x 3<br>
yO = 0550 mm yl = 1700 mm y2 = 1700 mm y3 = 1891 mm<br>
Substituting the values in the above equation, we obtain the position of CG on Y-Axis = 1185 mm<br>
The position of CG (3950,1185) is shown in the Figure 3(f)-<br>

10.	An improved fire-tender for high-rise fire fighting and rescue operation on<br>
narrow / congested roads, substantially as herein described and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
This and other objects of the present invention are achieved by providing a hydraulically operated retractable elevated platform which can rise vertically upto a height of about 27 - 30 feet shooting water / foam under pressure upto a height of three storeys, maintaining the center of gravity.<br>
The unique design of the elevating hydraulic platform mounted on a conventional fire tender operates without disturbing the center of gravity. It is provided with built in pump and storage tank for extinguishing media for fire fighting.<br>
The design allows the fire tender with retracted platform to move into lanes / road where standard elevated systems cannot enter or operate. This hydraulic platform will elevate to a height of approx 27 - 30 feet and shoot the water / foam into the fire even up to three storeys. The height of the elevated platform can further be extended by about 30 ft using an extension ladder. Pressure of water / foam will be of high standards, compared to the old practice of connecting of number of hoses to hydrant connections at the base level. This can also be utilized as a rescue platform.<br>
Thus the present invention provides an improved fire-tender for high-rise fire fighting and rescue operation on narrow / congested roads comprising an elevating hydraulic platform mounted on a fire tender characterized in that said fire-tender is provided with a built-in pump and tanks for storing extinguishing media; and in that said elevating platform is capable of being raised vertically to the desired height for fire fighting and rescue operatio<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to provide a fire tender which can enter narrow roads and congested areas for both high rise fire fighting and rescue operation.<br>
