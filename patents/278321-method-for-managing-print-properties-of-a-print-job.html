				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to decide the run time properties of a Print document submitted by a user based on its current printer condition such as toner status, pending jobs, job's priority and priority of the job submitter (predefined by the system administrator) from where the job is getting initiated. This invention further relates to the properties such as quality, Priority and other properties which can be decide at the Printer, based on the current printer condition, in the Printer or MFP (With Print Facility). This invention further relates to document print properties at the run time. More specifically this invention relates to a method and system for deciding the run time print properties and applying them on the submitted job, decision on those are based on the status of the printer at the time of print and priority of a job submitter. More particularly this invention relates to deciding the various print property of a document, in queue for printing based on the current printer condition and priority of the job submitter.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There is considerable amount of work done in this field since deciding the properties of a job is a hot field in printer domain. Following is the patent and related literature that is already available in this domain.<br>
US Patent number: 20040163049<br>
 <br>
The patent number 20040163049 teaches a very generic system that can decide the print properties of the document based on the print template. To achieve the object, the related art is capable of registering the print settings for a document being currently edited as template information and reading the registered template information as print settings for the document being currently edited or a new document. Thus, in this invention, the print settings for an existing document can be utilized as print settings for printing a document. More preferably, the contents of a registered template can be edited. Though the claim is deciding the print document based on the previous properties but there is no mention about how to change the properties of a job after submitting. More preferably it modifies the print setting by changing the print template.<br>
In short, the related art invention relates to a document processing method providing a function of making print settings for document data generated by a document processing program<br>
According to this invention, a document processing method wherein print settings for printing a document are changeable, the method comprises: a registration process for registering print settings for a document being edited as template information; and a reading process for reading the template information registered by the registration process as print settings for the document being edited or a new document.<br>
 <br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1)	The related art is more about the deciding the print properties at the time of submission of a job. Hence it is more like submitting a job in fixed format.<br>
2)	It decides the print properties based on the template. In order to change the properties of a print job, either editing the current or use another existing template is required.<br>
3)	This art doesn't decide the various print properties at the printer; all properties are static in this case.<br>
4)	Properties of print document are not depending on the user usage frequency.<br>
5)	Properties of the print are independent of the priority of the job submitter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The new invention is a better method and provides a better system which can be used for the case of efficient and effective usage of printing device. It uses the current condition of the printer and the priority of the job submitter, to decide the print properties and based on that it will change the properties of the submitted<br>
 <br>
job. Hence it is more dynamic system not only uses the properties of the job at the time of submission but make the necessary change based on the printer condition and the priority of the submitter. In this method the properties of the print document can be changed dynamically so a better usage of printing device is possible. Also the user having a higher hierarchy compare to other can use the printer with relatively less waiting time even many jobs are already there in printing queue. This invention will make use of innovations in technology such as those mentioned in related art to achieve highly meaningful results that will make the system more reliable.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of deciding the various print properties of a document, in queue for printing based on the current printer condition and priority of the job submitter comprising the steps of;<br>
(a)	submitting a Print job on network printer by the user;<br>
(b)	checking the current condition of the printer if dynamic setting/change of print properties is allow;<br>
(c)	checking the properties of the submitted job;<br>
(d)	rescheduling the print document, without any change in print properties and updating the user log data if the priority of the user is very high or current printer condition allows the desired properties; and<br>
(e)	changing the properties of the job and rescheduling the said job if<br>
the priority of the user is not high and current printer status does not supports the desired requirement ,<br>
 <br>
wherein the log table is updates after printing of the job is completed.<br>
Whenever a job is submitted for the printing, necessary changes in the printing properties if required is done using a fuzzy logic or data mining algorithms performed on the previous stored data. As soon as the user submits a Print job, the job submitter and the current condition of the printer is checked and if the properties of the document are required to change, the necessary change is made in the print properties.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a printer system for deciding the various print property of a document, in queue for printing based on the current printer condition and priority of the job submitter comprising:<br>
(a)	means for submitting a Print job on network printer by the user;<br>
(b)	means for checking the current condition of the printer if dynamic setting/change of print properties is allow;<br>
(c)	means for checking the properties of the submitted job;<br>
(d)	means for rescheduling the print document, without any change in print properties and updating the user log data if the priority of the user is very high or current printer condition allows the desired properties; and<br>
(e)	means for changing the properties of the job and rescheduling the said job if the priority of the user is not high and current printer status does not supports the desired requirement,<br>
wherein the log table is updates after printing of the job is completed.<br>
 <br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a Flow chart illustration of the working of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Working of the invention:<br>
 <br>
The invention is about deciding the print properties of the job, submitted to the printing device at the actual time of printing i.e. the properties of the print get changes based on the current status of printer and priority of a user. Various steps are as follow:<br>
1.	Submit a Print job on network printer.<br>
2.	If dynamic setting/change of print properties is allow, Check the current condition of the printer.<br>
3.	Check the properties of the submitted job.<br>
4.	If the priority of the user is very high or current printer condition allows the desired properties, reschedule the print document, without any change in print properties and update the user log data.<br>
5.	If the priority of the user is not high and current printer status does not supports the desired requirement, Change the properties of the job and reschedule. After printing update the log table.<br>
The objective of the invention is to make the printing device usage more efficiently and effectively in a common environment, i.e. network environment. By using the current technique based on the current condition of the printer and the job submitter, properties of the print can be decided. This is achieved by applying a method best suited for the document under consideration. The invention is aware of the drastically changing scenarios in today's world and hence allows the user to decide on adding any new criteria for making the decision on print properties.<br>
The working of the invention is based on the fact that the based on the printer<br>
 <br>
condition and job submitter, certain properties of a print document can be changed. Its apply the fuzzy logic or data mining algorithms on the previous stored data and based on that whenever a job is submitted for the printing, its manipulate and make the necessary changes in the printing properties if required.<br>
Data mining algorithms may be the simplest one like Apriori or any proprietary one can be use, this is more an approach to decide the print properties when we are going to make change. So can be general based on well known fact or drive from the log reports. Also can be decided by System Administrator.<br>
As soon as the user submits a Print job in the proposed system, system will check the job submitter and the current condition of the printer. If the properties of the document are required to change, it will make the necessary change in the print properties (some are mention above) by using some known algorithms of data mining or fuzzy logic on the previous log report and some predefined decision, and based on that perform the print operation. After printing the system will update the log report so that it can be used for the future decision.<br>
Flow chart for the working of the invention is explained here.<br>
1.Start<br>
2. Print Job Submitted by the user.<br>
3.Checking current condition of the printer (like print job in queue, toner condition,<br>
drum condition) and the priority of the job submitter.<br>
 <br>
4.Checking the print properties of the job.<br>
5.	A check is made to confirm any requirement or request to change the property of Print Document.<br>
6.	If any requirement or request is there, Change the Properties of submitted job based on the predefined criteria.<br>
7.Then print the document with new print properties and Update the log report of the printer.<br>
8.	If no requirement or request is there Print the document with the same print property at the time of submission.<br>
9.	Finally Update the log report of the printer.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
Example:<br>
Case 1: Printer Condition is ready to support the required parameter of the print or feature is disabled.<br>
In this case the properties of the print will remain same what is set by the end user. Case 2: Print Properties are required to change i.e. feature is enabled:<br>
 <br>
In this case two major factor to decide the print properties of a document are the user priority and current printer condition.<br>
If the user is a normal user that is the priority of the user is not very high (A simple Employee) the print properties will get changed based on the various parameter and system administrator setting. And in case if the user priority is very high (Manager) the print properties will remain unchanged.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
•	The system uses well known better method like fuzzy logic and data mining algorithms to decide the properties of print document, hence better utilization of printer resource is possible.<br>
•	The system decide the properties based on the current condition of the printer and priority of the job submitter, hence waiting time as well as quality of print for the job submitted depend on the current printer condition not only at the time of submission.<br>
•	It uses the job submitter as one parameter to decide the print properties hence response time for the higher priority people is much faster then the normal system.<br>
•	Unlike the prior art, the system makes decide the properties of the printing job at the run time that is after submission and a better dynamic system compare to the related arts.<br>
 <br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
