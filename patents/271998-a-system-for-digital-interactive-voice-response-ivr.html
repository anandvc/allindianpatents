PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
DIGITAL IVR<br>
TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES LIMITED<br>
An Indian Company of Bombay House, 24, Sir Homi Mody Street, Mumbai-400 001,<br>
Maharashtra, India.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
Field of invention:<br>
The invention relates to data transfer through the network.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Interactive Voice zResponse (IVR) is an electronic system that provides voice response to the user's query initiated via telephone and any remote communication device. The remote communication device can be a wireless phone, walky, VOIP, satellite phone, or a mobile phone.<br>
Conventional IVR solution comprises a computer with IVR software. Computer may house telephony interface card. IVR services can be availed by standard wired phones or remote communication devices. A standard wired phone (Landline phone) has limited/ no intelligence and very limited signaling capacity i.e. landline phone can pass digits [(0 to 9),*, #] by generating Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) tones. Thus very limited functionality can be provided to the user.<br>
Remote communication devices have comparatively more intelligence, memory capability and support more exhaustive communication and signaling methodologies (TCP / IP, SIP and the like). Additionally, the remote communication device network infrastructure permits downloading of applications over the air to the remote communication device.<br>
Conventionally, IVR plays voice menus to users, accepts inputs from the users and provides appropriate response in a voice format. The voice menus -<br>
2<br>
 <br>
(prompts) are stored on a computer (IVR server) remotely located from the user. These prompts are streamed to the client in real time thus necessitating:<br>
1)	Availability of several hardware / software ports for connecting to client, and hence, demanding for more computing power.<br>
2)	Establishment of continuous connection with a server, again consuming considerable computing and voice call transportation resources.<br>
This limits the effectiveness of the solution.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
US Patent Application No. 20030112931 describes a system and method for facilitating navigation of IVR menu in which is disclosed the mapping of IVR menu options in textual or graphical format. However, this does not extend to presentation on voice menus in voice format.<br>
US Patent Application No. 20030074198 discloses the selection and display of text menu by converting audio IVR menus to a text menu. However, this does not extend beyond text menus.<br>
US Patent No. 7092702 discloses a generalized application framework post production of a mobile phone and talks of cable loading the application to a mobile phone delivering service centric functionality. This invention does not extend to generating voice-based results for a query<br>
The system and method envisaged in accordance with this invention aims to overcome the limitations of the prior art.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
The principal object of this invention is to exploit the enhanced capabilities of a mobile infrastructure of remote communication devices, resulting in better user experience and reduced communication cost to the client.<br>
One more object of this invention is to make remote communication devices more user-friendly.<br>
Another object of this invention is to reduce the cost of existing information providing services.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to use fewer resources and investments compared to conventional systems.<br>
An additional object of this invention is to have a system which is easy to maintain and easy to upgrade.<br>
Lastly, another object of this invention is to broaden the coverage of the information disseminating services so as to ensure wider reach to users irrespective of location.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a system which proposes:<br>
4<br>
 <br>
1.	A  means   for  breaking  down  of IYR  application   in  following<br>
functionalities:<br>
a)	Playback means for voice menu to select, distinguish, and segregate different types of queries at the user end;<br>
b)	Input means (sequence of digits, letters, special characters or the like from the keypad of a mobile phone) for accepting inputs at the user end;<br>
c)	Query formulation means at the user end;<br>
d)	Transmitter means at the user-end to transmit the formulated query;<br>
e)	Receiver means at the server-end to receive the formulated query;<br>
f)	Interface means to enable connectivity between the transmitter and receiver end; typically to transfer the formulated query to the server and to transfer the answered query to the user end.<br>
g)	Processing means at the server end for executing the query and to obtain appropriate results.<br>
h) Conversion means at the client end to convert the results of the query in a<br>
voice signal format.<br>
i) Playback means at the user end to relay the results to the user<br>
2.	A downloading means for the functionalities of a), b), c), h and i) over the air to the remote communication device.<br>
3.	An execution means for executing the functionalities of a), b), c), h and i) on the remote communication device itself.<br>
4.	Another execution means for executing the functionality of g) on the machine hosting IVR server side application.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
This would bring in following benefits<br>
Since the playback is mostly local, total call charges would be much lesser.<br>
This enables users to replay the menu as many times as needed or till it is understood in totality without voice transport cost implications.<br>
Since computing power of a remote communication device is used, server side load is much less. This would result in faster response from server side. As well the server side investments would be less.<br>
With availability of remote communication device application development framework like Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), downloading the application over the air is possible and would thus result in ease of maintenance and upgradation.<br>
Hosting of IVR in multiple languages is easily possible<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the proposed architecture for realizing the envisaged functionality.<br>
Detailed Description of the Detailed Drawings:<br>
The system envisaged in accordance with this invention comprises a client part (through the remote communication device) and server part (through the computer). The Client part and the server part both communicate through the network.<br>
Components of IVR client residing on the remote communication device:<br>
6<br>
 <br>
Prompts and menus store:<br>
This module is a storehouse of generic voice prompts and text menus. These resources will be downloaded over the air or preloaded in the remote communication device by the service provider. The format of prompts shall be compatible with the format supported by remote communication device. The prompts may include the generic information required like numbers, months, currency and the like information requested by the user.<br>
Application script:<br>
This script represents how the user will be guided to get the requisite information and the actions that need to be taken by IVR system; typically acting as an interface between the user and the IVR system<br>
IVR Engine:<br>
