				<td>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Chlorine Supply Regulator for Potable Water<br>
This invention relates to improvement in device to regulate the mixing of chlorine in water to make it potable and disinfected.<br>
Various chemicals like chloride, fluoride, arsenic and many other harmful chemicals are present in water beneath the earth surface. Since these chemicals are mixed with water, they affect human body very gradually &amp; may result in many harmful diseases. Hence, it is very important to add right amount of chlorine in the water else many fatal diseases like typhoid, diarrhoea, dysentery, cholera and viral may occur. Besides this one can suffer from swelling in intestines, severe stomachache, vomiting or diarrhoea on drinking contaminated water. Therefore bleaching powder is proved as a complete disinfectant, which kill all bacterias and germs present in water and for this process chlorine gas or bleaching powder is usually used. Tubewells are the main source of water supply in rural &amp; urban areas if appropriate quantity of chlorine is added time to time in the water it will be germfree and would be fit for drinking. Keeping these things in view, chlorine supply regulator for potable water is invented as the existing system being adopted by the Govt. and the Public are pragmatically failure.<br>
The Invented device is manually operated and required no external power in the form of electricity or battery. It attaches with the tubewell pump outlet pipe and force of the water pressure of the tubewell coming through tubewell pump outlet pipe runs this device. In majority of tubewells supplying drinking water across the states, chlorine are mixed by pump operators which sometimes proved failure due to improper mixing of chlorine in the water. Excess quantity of chlorine in the water makes the water impotable as it has very irritating smell. The department of public health has started using electricity run machines at some places. Those machines have failed on two counts. Since, they run using tullupumps, many times the pumps can't withstand the water pressure and stop functioning. Secondly, when the electricity goes off these power-operated machines have to put off immediately as it pulls back water. Besides these electricity run machines have to be put on and off separately whereas the invented device is controlled by the pump only and required no extra manpower.<br>
These problems are overcome by the present invention, which provides a regulator. The inlet part of main delivery pipe of the regulator is assembled with tubewell water outlet pipe. When the tubewell operates, the water comes with pressure in main delivery pipe and then comes in inlet pipe line of the regulator. The water passes through the return valve which is assembled with inlet pipe line which controls the flow of water coming from main delivery pipe line. Then water comes in first portion of the chlorine tank. The chlorine tank has two portion, one for inlet and another for mixing of chlorine. A return valve is assembled with first portion of the chlorine tank, which controls the return flow of water coming from chlorine tank. Water comes into chlorine tank through return valve and mix with chlorine powder, which is inserted into chlorine tank through main hole built at the top of the chlorine tank. The mixture of water and chlorine then comes in outlet pipe line and passes through gate valve which controls the quantity of the mixture to be added in tubewell water. The outlet pipe line is also comprises a return valve which controls the return flow of water coming from main delivery pipe. Gate valve controls the quantity of the mixture so that every drop of water that goes through main delivery inlet portion to main delivery outlet portion should have right amount of chlorine in it.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig. No. 1:1, Fig. No. 1:2 &amp; Fig. No. 1:3 it can be seen that Chlorine Supply Regulator according to this Invention comprises three main sections like (i) Main Delivery Section (ii) chlorine Tank Section (iii) Housing Section. Main Delivery Section (i) as per fig. 1:4 mainly comprises inlet pipe line (9) and outlet pipe line (10); Chlorine Tank Section (2) as per fig. 1:5 mainly comprises Chlorine Tank (17) made of Steel, Stopper (14), Main Hole Handle (20), Chlorine Feeder (21), Flange (16) &amp; Return Valve (22) ; Housing Section (3) as per fig. 1:6 mainly comprises Housing (26) made of Stainless Steel, Drum Retainer Front (23), Drum Retainer Back (24), Door Retainer (25), Door (27), Window Retainer-1 (31), Window Retainer-2 (32) and Window Cover (33).<br>
The chlorine tank made of stainless steel (2) is assembled with main delivery pipe line (1) through inlet pipe line (9) and outlet pipe line (10). The inlet portion of the main delivery pipe is assembled with tubewell water outlet pipe. The flow of water from tubewell comes in main delivery pipe and then main delivery pipe to it comes in inlet pipe of regulator and passes through Return Valve (51) which controls the flow of water coming from main delivery pipe and then comes in first portion of chlorine tank. A Return Valve (22) is assembled in first portion of chlorine tank which controls the flow of water coming from chlorine tank. The water then mix with chlorine which is inserted into chlorine tank through main hole, which is comprises a main hole handle (20) and a stopper (14). The mixture of water and chlorine then comes in outlet pipe line (10) and passes through gate valve (42) which controls the quantity of the mixture to be added in tubewell water. The outlet pipe line is also comprises a Return Valve (40) which controls the return flow of water coming from main delivery pipe to chlorine tank. The chlorine tank is based upon Housing (21) which is made of stainless steel.<br><br><br><br><br>
