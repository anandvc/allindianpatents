Robust thermally insulated bottle<br>
This invention is a two level leak sealing bottle design for hot and cold fluid storage for a long duration as mentioned in claim (2). It has successfully amalgamated material sciences (strength and heat insulation properties) with the thermal performance.<br>
People accustomed to home prepared beverages in course of travel or longer working hours used to carry a thermo flask along with them. No design of thermo flask would retain hot water more than 4 hrs and sustain tea or coffee beyond an hour. Leakage of hot fluid (coffee or tea) is not desirable. Office goers normally travel in overcrowded trains or buses for more than an hour. There are chances associated with flask breakage in course of jockeying each other. The flask is also not designed to clean it easily.<br>
No such closest prior art is available incorporating those claimed features of the invention. However following disclosures references are enclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,612,456 discloses more or less similar lid arrangement for drinking cups served in restaurants. The ideal lid design would also be simple and hence cost effective to manufacture.; U.S. Pat. No 6,629,618 describe a thermally insulated glass bottle with an interstitial space in the sides and bottom a design to prevent condensation that forms on the exterior of a bottle and to resolve safety problem associated with bottle breakage.<br>
The core objective of this invention is to incorporate a perfect leak proof arrangement for a prolonged period (in hrs) as mentioned in the principal claim and dependent claim (6). The design is robust to resist shock and impact loads in case of accidental dropping. Further compact, weightless and odour free bottle design is a value addition as mentioned in claim (8) and (9).<br>
The invention is an improved version of thermo flask. Desirable features of thermo flask are incorporated in the bottle design.<br>
Staff members working in office would like to taste home coffee hot and juice chill, Thermo flasks do find its place in basic science books. A trade-off is normally made between the weight of the flask and its durability. These insulating flasks are fragile in nature. Several modifications have been made in the basic design of the flasks to suit the local requirements. Yet there is no satisfactory design to incorporate all desirable features of thermo flasks.<br>
The invention has incorporated all desirable values of an ideal thermo flask in the bottle design to suit day- to-day requirements of office goers and patients. Inner shell stores the hot fluid. Outer shell protects the inner shell from shocks. Vacuum space between two shells acts as a thermal insulation. Both the shells are made out of stainless steel. The bottle is designed to retain a hot fluid up to 96° C for a day. Two sealing arrangements<br><br>
are incorporated to suit aforementioned requirements. The ball and cork arrangement present in the inner shell acts as a stopper. The inner stopper is used to resist the leak from inner cup. The outer stopper acts as a lock. The outer and inner shells are joined at inner stopper. This arrangement prevents further fluid leakage. The special design of both outer and inner stopper is responsible for reliable thermal performance. The outer shell is at room temperature even though hot water is poured to it at 90° C.<br>
Seven grooves have been made in the bottom insert of the bottle to enhance its durability. The designed bottom surface makes the device resistant to impact loads and shocks when it is dropped down. The cup shape and serrated portion enhances the strength of the thermal flask.<br>
The bottom of inner shell is welded to eliminate concavity. Smooth inner surface makes it easy to clean the surface and the odour free bottle design is a value addition. Even though additional features are incorporated, the bottle is designed in a manner that its weight is minimum. The bottle is compact and developed to facilitate portability.<br>
Brief description of drawings<br>
Fig 1 describes complete overview of the thermally insulated bottle<br>
Fig 2 enumerates elevation of the top insert<br>
Detailed description of drawings<br>
Referring to fig 1, the complete specification of the arrangement of various components of thermally insulated bottle is obtained. Top insert (1) acts as a lock and the inner stopper (2) acts as a leak proof. Inner shell (5) retains the fluid. The inner cup (6) is an ornamental design feature present in the bottom of the inner shell (5). Outer shell (6) acts as a case protecting the inner shell and to facilitate a vacuum space to provide thermal insulation. The bottom insert (8) along with the outer cup (7) augments the strength of the insulating bottle and protects it from breakage when the bottle is accidentally dropped.<br>
Fig 2 describes the coupling arrangement of the top insert thread. The outer stopper (1) is joined with inner stopper (2) through a thread arrangement. The curved guide way is provided on either side of inner stopper. The balls (3) provided on either side of the inner stopper (2) acts as a lock.<br>
For office goers, patients and tourists who are zealous with home prepared this thermally insulated bottle design is a boon. Atlas metal processor has specially designed a level stopper mechanism besides the bottom surface to enhance the over all performance and durability of the insulated bottle. The design features has incorporated to carve out following advantages:<br>
Ø	100% leak proof arrangement for a prolonged period<br>
Ø	Reliable thermal performance<br><br>
Ø	Specially designed bottom surface to resist breakage when the bottle is dropped accidentally<br>
Ø	Weightless and compactable design<br>
Ø	The inner shell designed to facilitate easy cleaning and odour free surface<br>
Atlas Metal Processors Pvt. Ltd must authorize reproduction of those attributes. The design may be modified to suit semisolid foods for infants/children at desirable temperature. Similar such cost effective and compact design arrangement may also be incorporated to sustain solid food items for a longer period<br>
I Claim that<br>
1.	This invention is a robust thermally insulated leak proof two-shell bottle for designed for hot and cold fluid storage for a long period (hrs).<br>
2.	The bottle design has incorporated two-stopper arrangement for fluid and thermal sealing mechanism to facilitate reliable thermal performance.<br>
3.	The two-shell arrangement described in claim 1 consists of an outer stainless steel shell and an inner stainless steel shell. Vacuum space between both the shells act as a thermal insulator.<br>
4.	The surface of the inner insulating shell as described in claim 3 is made as smooth as possible. The bottle is designed incorporating with suitable features to augment durability.<br>
5.	As mentioned in claim 2 the thermally insulated bottle is provided with an<br>
inner stopper to resist the leak from inner cup. The outer stopper acts as a lock. Combination of two stoppers acts as heat and a leak proof arrangement. The two shells are joined at the inner stopper.<br>
6.	Aforementioned arrangement as described in claim 5 has resulted in a perfect thermal and fluid leak proof. This design arrangement facilitates the bottle to retain 96° C hot fluid for a day<br>
7.	Grooves are made in the bottom surface of the bottle. The cup like serrated portion in the bottom augments the strength of the bottle. As claimed in statement 4 the insulated bottle is designed to resist breakage due to impact and shock loading.<br>
8.	Smooth inner surface described in claim 4 eliminates concave surface in the bottle. This facilitates cleaning of the bottle. Odour free characteristic is an added value of this invention.<br>
9.	The bottle is compact and weightless.<br>
