				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for determining transmission power<br>
in a packet data communication system and a wireless packet data<br>
communication system, and particularly to a packet data transmission, and<br>
more particularly to a system and method for determining transmission power<br>
of packet data.<br>
Background of the Related Art<br>
A mobile communication system using radio packet data transmission at high<br>
speed is a system for providing communication service between mobile stations<br>
such as a potable terminal or a car phone, or between a mobile station and a<br>
telephone subscribed in a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).<br>
Generally, a radio communication network such as the mobile communication<br>
system uses a circuit method and a packet method in order to provide a data<br>
service.<br>
The circuit method is a method which allocates needed resources and<br>
channels to a transmission node which will transmit data, and the allocated<br>
channel is a dedicated circuit for the duration of the call. By contrast, the packet<br>
method is a method excluding monopolies on the channel, where a channel is<br>
allocated to a corresponding transmission node only when there is data to be<br>
transmitted. In a packet method, the allocated channel is released when the<br>
data transmission is completed, and thereby the other transmission node can<br>
transmit data.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram showing a related art mobile communication<br>
network including multiple mobile stations 10 and a base station 20.<br>
Figure 2 is a flow chart showing a related art circuit switched data transmission<br>
process. As shown, the data transmission process of a circuit method includes<br>
setting a call between a transmission node and a receive node (S1) and<br>
allocating resources such as time slot, a trunk, and a memory device after the<br>
call is set (S2). The process further includes transmitting data through the<br>
allocated resources and channel (S3) and releasing the allocated resources<br>
when the data transmission is completed (S4, S5).<br>
In the data transmission system of a circuit method, a call should be set<br>
between the transmission node and the receiver node before the data is<br>
transmitted. In addition, resources such as the time slot, the trunk, and the<br>
memory device, which are needed for data transmission, are allocated by the<br>
system when the call is set.<br>
When the call setting is completed and a channel is allocated, the<br>
corresponding call occupies the allocated channel until the data transmission is<br>
completed. When the data transmission is completed, the system releases the<br>
resources allocated for the data transmission.<br>
As described above, the circuit method uses all bandwidth provided by the<br>
system, and a large amount of data can be transmitted. However, only about<br>
5% of the connection time is used for the data transmission, and therefore the<br>
utility of the channel and the number of calls which can be accepted is small.<br><br>
As described above, the circuit method is not suitable to provide high through-<br>
put communications, and therefore the packet method has been developed for<br>
IMT-2000 (International Mobile Telecommunications 2000) service.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart showing a related art packet switched data transmission<br>
process. As shown therein, the data transmission of a packet method includes<br>
identifying whether or not there is transmission data in the transmission node<br>
(S11) and allocating a channel if there is transmission data in the transmission<br>
node (S12). The method further includes transmitting the data after the channel<br>
is allocated (S13) and releasing the allocated channel when the data<br>
transmission is completed (S14, S15).<br>
Data transmission by the packet method occupies the channel only when data<br>
is included in a respective transmission node, and therefore more transmission<br>
nodes can transmit data and the utility of the channel can be increased.<br>
Figure 4 is a signal diagram showing signals in the data transmission process<br>
of a packet method suggested by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership<br>
Project) the asynchronous part of IMT-200, and Figure 5 is a conceptual view<br>
according to that same method.<br>
CPCH (Common Packet Channel) suggested by the 3GPP is a method in<br>
which a channel is set before data transmission and the data is transmitted<br>
when the channel is set, similar to the circuit method. It is different from the<br>
circuit method in that the channel is allocated only when there is data to be<br>
transmitted on the transmission node.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 4, the CPCH data transmission of the 3GPP method<br>
includes transmitting an AP (Access Preamble) from a mobile station 10 to a<br>
base station 20 (S21) and transmitting an AP-AICH (Access Preamble-<br>
Acquisition Indication Channel-acknowledge) signal from the base station 20 to<br>
the mobile station 10 as a response to the AP signal (S22). The method further<br>
includes transmitting a CD (Collision Detection) Preamble from the mobile<br>
station 10, which received the response, to the base station 20 (S23) and<br>
transmitting a CD-AICH (Collision Detection- Acquisition Indication Channel-<br>
acknowledge) signal from the base station 20 to the mobile station 10 as a<br>
response signal to the CD preamble signal (S24). Finally, the method includes<br>
transmitting information data and control data from the mobile station 10 to the<br>
base station 20 (S25).<br>
Referring to both Figures 4 and 5, the mobile station 10 transmits an AP at<br>
position P0 with a lowest level of transmission power set by the system in step<br>
S21. If the base station 20 does not receive the AP transmitted from the mobile<br>
station 10 on position P0, the base station 20 can not be synchronized and can<br>
not generate a response signal AP-AICH. Therefore, the mobile station 10<br>
again transmits the AP at position P1 after a prescribed period of time is<br>
passed, with a transmission power which is increased at a prescribed level<br>
greater than that of the AP transmitted from the position P0 in step S21.<br>
When the base station 20 receives the AP, the base station 20 indicates that<br>
the signal is synchronized by transmitting an AP-AICH signal to the mobile<br>
station 10 as a response in step S22, and then the mobile station 10 transmits<br>
a CD-preamble to the base station 20 in step S23. In addition, the base station<br>
20 transmits a CD-AICH signal to the mobile station 10 as a response to the<br>
CD-preamble signal in step S24. The CD-preamble signal is for preventing<br><br>
impacts when more than one mobile station 10 requests allocation of the same<br>
channel at the same time.<br>
The mobile station 10 prepares for the data transmission by passing through<br>
steps S21, S22, S23, and S24. The mobile station 10 then transmits<br>
information data and control data through a PCPCH(UL) ( Physical Common<br>
Packet Channel(Up Link)) to the base station 20 in step S25. In addition, the<br>
base station 20 regularly transmits signals for power control, pilot, and CPCH<br>
control to the mobile station 10 through a DPCCH(DL) (Dedicated Physical<br>
Control Channel(Down Link)).<br>
The method of the related art has many problems. For Example, in the case of<br>
the packet method suggested by 3GPP, a plurality of AP's are transmitted for<br>
the respective packets, and the first AP is transmitted with the lowest level of<br>
transmission power set by the system for minimizing interruption to the other<br>
channels. Thus, accessing the base station takes a long time using this<br>
method, since the AP is transmitted with initial transmission power which has<br>
fixed level, and the accessing process is performed each time a packet is<br>
transmitted. The disadvantageous delays associated with initial transmission<br>
power adjusting times, t, are illustrated in Figure 6. Accordingly, high speed<br>
data transmission is difficult.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart showing a process for determining a transmission power<br>
after a first packet has been sent, according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention. As shown therein, a method for determining the transmission power<br>
according to the present invention preferably includes calculating a<br>
transmission power (S31) ; transmitting a CD Preamble with the calculated<br>
transmission power (S32), and identifying whether or not a channel occupying<br>
signal, for example a CD-AICH signal, is transmitted from a base station 20 as<br>
a response to the CD Preamble (S33). The method preferably further includes<br>
transmitting packet data if the channel occupying signal is transmitted from the<br>
base station (S34) and identifying a result of the packet data transmission (S35,<br>
S36).<br>
If the channel occupying signal is not transmitted from the base station 20 in<br>
step S33, the process may be ended. If the data transmission fails in step S36,<br>
then the transmission power is increased (S37), and steps S32, S33, S34, S35,<br>
and S36 may be repeated.<br>
The transmission power of a second or subsequent packet may be determined<br>
by the transmission power of a previous data transmission; a changed amount<br>
of the transmission power of the mobile station 10 perceived by the base<br>
station 20 during previous data transmission; differences between the previous<br>
transmission power and the present transmission power of the base station 20<br>
as measured by the mobile station 10 ; and by a channel compensating value<br>
of the base station 20 controlling the strength of the transmission power of the<br>
mobile station 10 so as to be in proportion to the number of channels which are<br>
allocated.<br><br>
The mobile station 10 preferably determines the transmission power when a<br>
signal is transmitted to base station 20 in step S31. If the strength of the initial<br>
transmission power is too low, base station 20 cannot perceive the transmitted<br>
signal of mobile station 10. On the other hand, if the strength of the<br>
transmission power is too high, the signal of the corresponding mobile station<br>
channel may interrupt a signal of another channel. Therefore, it is<br>
advantageous to calculate an appropriate transmission power.<br>
Also, it is advantageous to calculate the transmission power as soon as<br>
possible so as to reduce accessing time. Where the calculation time is<br>
excessive each time respective packets are transmitted, high-speed data<br>
transmission may not be possible.<br>
The following expression may be used for determining the transmission power<br>
of a mobile station 10 for a second or subsequent packet according to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
Initial transmission power = transmission power of a first or previous packet<br>
transmission + controlled amount of the transmission power by the base station<br>
+ changed amount of received power + channel compensating value of the<br>
base station.<br>
The base station 20 preferably measures and calculates the transmission<br>
power of a previous packet of mobile station 10 during a first or prior data<br>
transmission. In addition, after data is transmitted, the base station 20<br>
preferably transmits a value corresponding to the controlled amount of the<br>
transmission power via a control signal to the mobile station 10.<br><br>
The changed amount of received power is the difference between the power of<br>
the signal transmitted from the base station 20 at previous packet transmission,<br>
and the power of the signal transmitted from the base station 20 at a next<br>
packet transmission, as measured by the mobile station 10.<br>
When the number of channels which are used is increased because of active<br>
call connections of mobile stations 10, interference between the channels may<br>
also increase. In addition, in order to prevent the interference between the<br>
channels, the base station 20 may increase the transmission power of mobile<br>
station 10. The amount of the increased electric power by the base station 20 is<br>
preferably the channel compensating value.<br>
As described above, the mobile station 10 preferably transmits the CD<br>
preamble with the calculated transmission power in step S32, and waits for a<br>
channel occupying signal. The base station 20 which received the preamble<br>
may then generate a channel occupying signal by allocating a channel in step<br>
S33. However, if there is no channel to be allocated to mobile station 10, or if<br>
the transmission power is too weak to perceive the CD preamble, the base<br>
station 20 does not generate the channel occupying signal in step S33. When<br>
the mobile station 10 does not receive the channel occupying signal, the mobile<br>
station 10 preferably turns off the electric power and ends the packet data<br>
transmission process.<br>
When the base station 20 transmits the channel occupying signal to the mobile<br>
station 10, the mobile station 10 preferably transmits the data in step S34 and<br>
S35. In response, the base station 20 preferably transmits an ACKJvlsg to the<br>
mobile station 10 to acknowledge receipt of the data. The ACK_Msg preferably<br>
includes an amended value of the transmission power, and the amended value<br><br>
may be an electric power controlling value which maintains the transmission<br>
power of the mobile station 10 by measuring the transmission power<br>
transmitted from the mobile station 10 to the base station 20.<br>
If the mobile station 10 does not receive the ACK_Msg in step S36, the mobile<br>
station 10 may determine that there is an error on the data transmitted by the<br>
mobile station 10 or that the transmission power is weak, and preferably<br>
increases the transmission power in step S37 and proceeds according to steps<br>
S32, S33, S34, S35, and S36.<br>
Figure 8 is a simulation view showing a determining process of the transmission<br>
power of a second or subsequent packet according to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention. As shown therein, the transmission power is preferably<br>
determined based on the transmission power used on a first or previous packet<br>
data transmission according to the present invention.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention has many advantages. For<br>
example, once the call connection is made, the connection to the base station<br>
20 can be made for subsequent packet transmissions faster than the method<br>
suggested by 3GPP. Power adjustment delays associated with the first packet<br>
transmission are similar to the method of 3GPP, however, next packet<br>
transmissions are faster than with the 3GPP method. Thus, transmitting time<br>
for subsequent packets is reduced, and data transmission speed can be<br>
increased.<br>
In an alternative embodiment a base station may adjust transmission power to<br>
a mobile station, instead of the mobile station adjusting power to a base station.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a mobile station may adjust transmission power to<br><br>
another mobile station. In still another embodiment, a fixed station may adjust<br>
transmission power to another fixed station.<br>
The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not<br>
to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be<br>
readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present<br>
invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims.<br>
Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the<br>
structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only<br>
structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br>

6.	The method as claimed in claim 7, wherein the transmission power is<br>
determined by summing the transmission power used in the previous transmission,<br>
the controlled amount of the transmission power by the second station (20), the<br>
changed amount of power received at the first station (10), and the channel<br>
compensating value of the second station (20).<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first station (10) is a<br>
mobile communication station and the second station (20) is a base station.<br>
8.	A wireless packet data communication system, comprising :<br>
a mobile terminal (10) configured to transmit packet data to a second<br>
station at a calculated transmission power, wherein the calculated transmission power<br>
is determined in accordance with at least one of a previous transmission power of the<br>
mobile terminal (10) and control information received by the mobile terminal (10) ■ and<br><br>
a base station (20) coupled to communicate with the first station and<br>
configured to transmit the control information to the mobile terminal (10).<br>
9.	The system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the control information is<br>
transmitted from the base station (20) to the mobile terminal (10) together with an<br>
acknowledgment message related to a previous data transmission from the mobile<br>
terminal (10).<br>
10.	The system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the mobile terminal (10) is<br>
also configured to transmit a preliminary signal to the base station (20) at the<br>
calculated power prior to transmitting the packet data.<br>
11.	The system as claimed in claim 10, wherein the mobile terminal (10)<br>
increases the calculated transmission power if no acknowledgment signal is received<br>
from the base station (20).<br>
12.	The system as claimed in claim 8, wherein the calculated transmission<br>
power is determined by summing the previous transmission power, a controlled<br>
amount of the transmission power by the second station, a changed amount of power<br>
received at the first station, and a channel compensating value of the second station.<br>
13.	A method of determining transmission power of a first station in a<br>
wireless packet data communication system, substantially as herein described,<br>
particularly with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
14. A wireless packet data communication system, substantially as herein<br>
described, particularly with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br>
Disclosed is a system and method for determining a transmission power in a radio<br>
packet data transmission system on the basis of the transmission power at the<br>
previous packet transmission. A preferred method includes: a step for calculating<br>
the transmission power; a step for transmitting a Preamble to the base station 20<br>
with the calculated transmission power; a step for receiving a channel occupying<br>
signal from the base station 20 as a response to the preamble; and a step for<br>
transmitting packet data after the channel occupying signal is transmitted and ending<br>
the packet data transmission process if the transmission is successfully made. The<br>
system and method advantageously reduce the amount of time required to transmit<br>
subsequent packets of data at more optimal power levels.</td>
