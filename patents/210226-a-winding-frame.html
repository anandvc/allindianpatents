				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present  invention relates to a winding frame which is pivolably securable to a winding machine support for supporting a rotatably driveable winding core onto which a yarn is wound. The term "winding core" is to be understood as a proxy for the term "winding tube" and "winding package". The term "filament" encompasses the totality of yarn formed geometries such as, for example, spinning or two-for-one or twist yarns of various machine assemblies.<br>
A winding frame of the type above referred to is disclosed, for example, in DE-PS 25 41 366, and includes two opposed carry arms between which is rotatably supported a winding core onto which yarn is to be wound. The rotatative driving of the winding core can be effected by a friction drive roller against which the winding core lies and which performs the function of a support roller Another possibility for effecting the driving of the winding core is an individual motor securable on the winding frame which directly drives the winding core which itself is supported against a freely rotatable support roller.<br>
In dependence upon, for example, out of round winding tubes or by virtue of the desired winding configuration, disturbances of the winding core rotation can occur which, especially with fast feeding yarn delivery assemblies, can lead to time absorbing, measurement inertia dependent<br>
lifting of the winding frame off the support roller. Such uncontrolled swing<br><br>
movements can, because of the increased slippage between, especially, the winding core and the friction drive roller, introduce defective windings, as well as increased wear of the winding frame support.<br>
The present invention achieves the objective of, in connection with the winding of packages such as, for example, twisted yam packages or the like, avoiding or, at least, significantly reducing, the winding operation disturbances.<br>
To achieve this objective, the inventive winding frame is characterized by a damping apparatus which acts thereon to oppose the unscheduled swing movements of the winding frame during the ordinary course of winding yarn onto a winding core.<br>
Such swing movements cannot, in contrast to a damping apparatus especially configured as a friction damping apparatus, be prevented by springs which are frequently provided on a damping apparatus to operate on the lifting element thereof, although such springs<br>
can serve to effect a predetermined pressing force of the winding core against the friction drive roller or the freely rotating support roller.<br>
The inventive damping apparatus preferably includes a guide rod movably secured to the winding frame upon which can act at least one braking surface adjustably movable in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the guide rod.<br>
The braking surface is in particular arranged on a housing which<br><br>
is pivolably mounted on the machine frame and can be actuated by spring or pressurized air.<br>
The invention  is described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1        is a schematic side view of the inventive<br>
winding frame in which a winding  core<br>
driveable by a friction drive roller is disposed;<br>
Figure 2        is an enlarged sectional view of a portion of<br>
the damping apparatus; Figure 3        is a view of a modified form of the damping<br>
apparatus shown in Figure 2. In accordance with Figure 1, the winding frame 1 of the present invention, which may be configured, for example, as a four link winding frame, is mounted on a console 32 representing a machine frame for swinging movement on an axis 6 in the dual opposed directions f. The winding frame includes two opposed carry arms of which only one carry arm 2 is shown in Figure 1 and on which a hand grip 3 can be provided for manual raising of the winding frame 1 in order to raise the winding core A off the friction drive roller 4 which drives it. Figure 1 further depicts, in schematic form, a typical yarn changing guide 5 operable to guide a filament or yarn F onto the winding core A.<br>
In the event that there is an individual motor direct drive of the<br><br>
winding core A, an individual motor (not shown) is disposed on one of the carry arms 2, whereby the friction drive roller 4 is configured as a freely rotating support roller.<br>
A guide rod 7, which is preferably formed of metal, especially<br>
chromium-nickel-steel, has one of its ends rolalably mounted to the winding frame 1 for rotation of the guide rod 7 about an axis 8 which is at a spacing from the axis of the four link frame on which the winding frame 1 is mounted.<br>
A cylinder housing 10 or 10', shown in detail in Figures 2 and 3, respectively, is pivotably or swingably mounted to a mounting arm 9 secured to the console or the machine frame 2. This cylinder housing 10 or 10' includes a step recess which forms a first cylinder chamber 20 or<br>
20', respectively, and another cylinder chamber 21 or 21', respectively, communicated therewith. The cylinder housing 10 or 10' is, furthermore, provided in the region of the cylinder chamber 20 or 20', respectively, with diametrically opposed elongate openings 10.1 or 10.1', respectively, through which the guide rod 7 or 7', respectively, is extended.<br>
A piston 11 or 11', respectively, is movably mounted in each housing 10 or 10*, respectively, each of which comprises a borehole 12 or 12', respectively, extending perpendicular to the piston axis for receiving there through the guide rod 7 or 7', respectively.<br>
In the embodiment of the damping apparatus shown in Figure 2,<br><br>
a loading spring 13 exerts a force on the left hand side of the piston 11, whereby the guide rod 7 is forced against a portion of the borehole 12 which acts in this capacity as a braking surface.<br>
The piston 11, as well as the piston 11', is formed, at least in the area thereof which forms the braking surface, out of plastic, preferably a thermoplastic.<br>
In the modified embodiment of the damping apparatus shown in Figure 3, the piston 11' is configured as a step piston, the portion of which within the smaller cylinder chamber 21' being impacted by pressurized air communicated into the chamber by a pressurized air connector 26, with the piston being so configured as a step piston so as to operate in a manner similar to the embodiment shown in Figure 2 in which the borehole 12' is configured as a braking surface for applying a<br>
predetermined braking force against the guide rod T. A pressure regulator 28 is actuable for controlling the delivery of pressurized air through a pressurized air conduit 27 (shown only schematically) to the pressurized air connector 26 for impact against the portion of the borehole 12' in the smaller cylinder chamber 21* configured as a braking surface, whereby a braking force tailored to the braking need of the guide rod 7 is delivered.<br>
A ring 30 or 30*, respectively, preferably formed of thermoplastic,<br>
is mounted on the exterior of the housing 10 or 10' respectively, to act as<br><br>
an inner limit of the elongate slot 10 or 10', respectively, by forming thereat a counter force body against which the guide rod 7 or 7', respectively, is moved upon the application of force on the guide rod by the braking surface.<br>
As needed, a release of the braking force application by the braking surface can be effected in the embodiments shown in both Figures 2 and 3 by the application of pressurized air against the<br>
respective section or portion of the piston within the larger cylinder chamber 20 or 20', respectively, the pressurized air being delivered through a pressurized air connector 16 or 16';, respectively, and the application of the pressurized air being actuated by controllable valve unit 18 or 18, respectively, connected to a pressurized air conduit 17 or 17', respectively, (shown only schematically) communicated with the pressurized air connector 16 or 16'. This permits the release of the piston 11 or 11', respectively, and, thereby, permits the manual hand damping of the winding frame or, respectively, the release of the piston in the event of an automatic raising of the winding frame such as, for example, by the occurrence of a yarn break.<br>
The application of pressurized air against the portion of the piston within the larger cylinder chamber 20 or 20', respectively, acts to counter the braking force being applied on the guide rod 7 or 7', respectively, in order to thereby release the guide rod 7 or 7', respectively, if the winding<br><br>
frame is to be raised for, for example,  the purpose of performing maintenance.<br><br><br><br><br>
