				<td>PREFORMED COMPOSITIONS IN SHAPED FORM<br>
COMPRISING POLYMER BLENDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The present Invention relates to preformed compositions in<br>
shaped form and the use of preformed compositions for sealing apertures.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Electromagnetic interference can be defined as undesired<br>
conducted or radiated electrical disturbances from an electrical or electronic<br>
source, including transients, that can interfere with the operation of other<br>
electrical or electronic apparatus. Such disturbances can occur at frequencies<br>
throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio frequency interference ("RFI")<br>
is often used interchangeably with electromagnetic interference ("EMI"), although<br>
RFI more property refers to the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum usually defined as 10 kilohertz (KHz) to 100 gigahertz (GHz).<br>
[003] Electronic equipment is typically enclosed in a housing. The<br>
housing not only serves as a physical barrier to protect the equipment from the<br>
environment, but also can serve to shield EMI/RFJ radiation. Enclosures having<br>
the ability to absorb and/or reflect EMI/RFI energy may be employed to confine<br>
the EMI/RFI energy within the source device, and to Insulate the device or other<br>
external devices from other EMI/RFI sources. To maintain accessibility to the<br>
internal components, most enclosures are provided with openable or removable<br>
accesses such as doors, hatches, panels, or covers. Gaps typically exist<br>
between the accesses and the corresponding mating surfaces that reduce the<br>
efficiency of the electromagnetic shielding by presenting openings through which<br>
radiant energy may be emitted. Such gaps also present discontinuities in the<br>
surface and ground conductivity of the housing, and in some cases may<br>
generate a secondary source of EMI/RFI radiation by functioning as a slot<br>
antenna.<br>
 [004] For filing gaps between the mating surfaces of the housing and<br>
removable accesses, gaskets and other seals are used to maintain electrical<br>
continuity across the structure, and to exclude environmental degradants such<br>
as particulates, moisture, and corrosive species. Such seals are bonded or<br>
mechanically attached to one or both of the mating surfaces and function to<br>
establish a continuous conductive path by conforming to surface irregularities<br>
under an applied pressure,<br>
[005] Conventional processes for manufacturing EMI/RFI shielding<br>
gaskets include extrusion, molding, and die-cutting. Molding involves the<br>
compression or injection molding of an uncured or thermoplastic resin into a<br>
certain configuration. Die-cutting involves the forming of a gasket from a cured<br>
polymeric material, which is cut or stamped into a certain configuration using a<br>
die. Form-in-place (TIP") processes are also used for forming EMI/RFI<br>
shielding gaskets wherein the process involves the application of a bead of a<br>
viscous, curable, electrically-conductive composition in a fluent state to a surface<br>
that is subsequently cured-in-place by the application of Heat, atmospheric<br>
moisture, or ultraviolet radiation to form an electrically-conductive, EMI/RFI<br>
shielding gasket.<br>
[006] Electrical conductivity and EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness is<br>
typically Imparted to polymeric gaskets by incorporating conductive materials<br>
within the polymer matrix. The conductive elements can include metal or metalplated<br>
particles, fabrics, meshes, and fibers. The metal can be in the form of, for<br>
example, filaments, particles, flakes, or spheres. Examples of metals include<br>
copper, nickel, silver, aluminum, tin, and steel. Other conductive materials that<br>
are used to impart EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness to polymer compositions<br>
include conductive particles or fibers comprising carbon or graphite. Conductive<br>
polymers such as polythiophenes, polypyrroles, polyaniline, poly(pphenylene)<br>
vinylene, polyphenylene sulffde, polyphenylene, and polyacetylene<br>
may also be used.<br>
[007] In addition to shielding EMI/RFI radiation, in certain applications it<br>
is also desirable that the seal be transparent to incident broad spectrum radiation<br>
used for detection, location, or recognition purposes. For example, microwave<br>
radiation from 5-18 GHz, 35 GHz, 94 GHz. 140 GHz and 220 GHz has useful<br>
military significance. Electromagnetic radiation incident on a surface will be<br>
partly reflected and partly absorbed by the material and the sum of these effects<br>
determines the shielding effectiveness. The shielding effectiveness depends on<br>
several factors including the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation, the<br>
conductivity of the shielding material, the thickness and permeability of the<br>
shielding material, and the distance between the radiating source and the<br>
EMI/RFI shield. At high frequencies, above about 10 GHz, shielding<br>
effectiveness is primarily determined by the ability of the shielding material to<br>
absorb the incident radiation. Ferromagnetic particles with high permeability<br>
such as iron, carbonyl iron, cobalt metal alloys, and nickel metal alloys are used<br>
as radar absorbing materials.<br>
[008] In addition to providing continuous electrical conductivity and<br>
EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness, in certain applications H is desirable that gasket<br>
or seals to surfaces exposed to the environment, such as in aviation and<br>
aerospace vehicles, not lead to corrosion of the metal surfaces. When dissimilar<br>
metal and/or conductive composite materials are joined in the presence of an<br>
electrolyte, a galvanic potential is established at the interface between the<br>
dissimilar conductors. When the interfacial seal is exposed to the environment,<br>
particularly under severe environmental conditions such as salt fog or salt fog<br>
containing a high concentration of SO2, corrosion of the least noble of the<br>
conductive surfaces will occur. Corrosion may lead to a degradation in the<br>
EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness of the seal. Mechanisms other than galvanic<br>
potentials, e.g. crevice corrosion, may also compromise the electrical and<br>
mechanical integrity of the enclosure.<br>
[009] Polysulfide polymers are known in the art. The production of<br>
polysulfide polymers is characterized by Fettes and Jorzak, Industrial<br>
Engineering Chemistry, November, 1950, on pages 2,217 to 2,223. The<br>
commercial use of polysulfide polymers in the manufacture of sealants for<br>
aerospace applications has long been known and commercially used.<br>
Polysulflde sealants have been used to seal aircraft exterior fuselage because of<br>
the high tensile strength, high tear strength, thermal resistance, and resistance<br>
to high ultraviolet light. Polysulfide sealants have been used to seal aircraft fuel<br>
tanks because of the resistance to fuel and adhesion upon exposure to fuel.<br>
[010] Polysulfide sealants are generally applied by extrusion using a<br>
gun. Extruding a sealant to seal apertures in airframe such as those associated<br>
with access doors or panels can require a significant amount of effort. The<br>
interior perimeter of the access door opening is masked and the exterior<br>
perimeter of the access door is coated with a release agent to avoid sealing an<br>
access door shut. The sealant is extruded and the access door is put In place<br>
and clamped down to force the excess sealant around the access door. The<br>
sea/ant is allowed to cure and the excess sealant is trimmed away. This process<br>
is time intensive and can add significant labor demands for servicing aircraft with<br>
many access doors. Some aircraft can have as many as a hundred or more<br>
access doors that are used to cover sensitive electronic equipment or fittings that<br>
must be periodically accessed.<br>
[011] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide compositions and methods<br>
for sealing access doors, for example those in an airfrarne of an aviation or<br>
aerospace vehicle, that are not as labor and time intensive as the conventional<br>
extrusion method for sealing the access doors. It is also desirable to provide<br>
such compositions and methods that further provide effective EMI/RFI shielding<br>
and cause minimal corrosion to conductive surfaces.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[012] The present invention is directed to preformed compositions in<br>
shaped form, comprising a polymer blend that comprises at least one polysulfide<br>
component and at least one polythioether component.<br>
[013] The present invention is further directed to methods for sealing an<br>
aperture comprising: (a) covering the aperture with the preformed composition<br>
of the present invention in shaped form; and (b) curing the composition so as to<br>
seal the aperture.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[014] The present invention is directed to a preformed composition in<br>
shaped form comprising a polymer blend comprising at least one polysulfide<br>
component and at least one polythioether component. The term "preformed11<br>
refers to a composition that can be made into a particular shape for ease of<br>
packaging, storage, and/or application. A composition that is preformed can be<br>
reshaped into any shape, either intentionally, or as a result of shipping and/or<br>
handling. The term "shaped form" refers to a configuration such that the<br>
thickness of the preformed composition is substantially less than the lateral<br>
dimension and includes but is not limited to tapes, sheets and cut-out or gasket<br>
forms. The "shaped form" can be in the form of a tape meaning a narrow shape,<br>
strip, or band that can be stored as rolls, coils, or strips. The "shaped form" can<br>
also be die-cut to the dimensions of the aperture to be sealed.<br>
[015] "Sealant" and like terms refer to compositions that have the ability<br>
to resist atmospheric conditions such as moisture and/or temperature and/or at<br>
least partially block tne transmission of materials such as water, fuel, and/or<br>
other liquids and gasses. Sealants often have adhesive properties, as well.<br>
"Aperture" refers to a hole, gap, slit or other opening. The term "elongated<br>
aperture" refers to such an opening in which the length is at least three-times the<br>
width. "Shielding" and like terms refer to the ability to divert, route, and/or reflect<br>
incident electromagnetic energy. Shielding effectiveness represents the ratio of<br>
the electromagnetic energy passing through a shield to the electromagnetic<br>
energy striking the shield.<br>
[016] The polymer blend of the present invention comprises at least<br>
one polysulfide component and at least one polythioether component. The<br>
"polysulfide component" of the present invention comprises a polysulfide<br>
polymer that contains multiple sulfur-sulfur linkages, i.e., —[S—S]—, in the<br>
polymer backbone and/or in the terminal or pendant positions on the polymer<br>
chain. Typically, the polysulfide polymers in the present invention will have two<br>
or more sulfur-sulfur linkages. Suitable polysulfides are commercially available<br>
from Akzo Nobel under the name THIOPLAST. THIOPLAST products are<br>
available in a wide range of molecular weights ranging, for example, from less<br>
than 1100 to over 8000, with molecular weight being the average molecular<br>
weight in grams per mole. Particularly suitable as a number average molecular<br>
weight of 1000 to 4000. The crosslink density of these products also varies,<br>
depending on the amount of crosslinking agent used. The "—SH" content, i.e.<br>
the mercaptan content, of these products can also vary. The mercaptan content<br>
and molecular weight of the polysulfide can affect the cure speed of the blend,<br>
with cure speed increasing with molecular weight.<br>
[017] In some embodiments, it is desired to use a combination of<br>
pojysulfides to achieve the desired molecular weight and/or crosslink density in<br>
the polymer blend. Different molecular weights and/or crosslink densities can<br>
contribute different characteristics to the blend and compositions incorporating<br>
the blend. For example, blends wherein the polysulfide component comprises<br>
more than one polysulfide polymer and one of the polysulfide polymers has a<br>
molecular weight of approximately 1000 have desirable non-crystallization<br>
properties.<br>
[018] The second component in the polymer blend of the present<br>
invention is a polythioether. The "polythioether component" of the present<br>
invention is a polymer comprising at least one polythioether linkage, i.e.,<br>
-[—CHa—GHz—S—CHz—CHr-]-. Typical polythioethers have from 8 to 200 of<br>
these linkages. Polythioethers suitable for use in the present invention indude<br>
those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,372,849. Suitable polythioethers typically<br>
have a number average molecular weight of 1000 to 10,000, such as 2,000 to<br>
5,000, or 3,000 to 4,000. In some embodiments, the polythioether component<br>
will be terminated with non-reactive groups, such as alkyl, and in other<br>
embodiments will contain reactive groups in the terminal or pendant positions.<br>
Typical reactive groups are thiol, hydroxyl, amino, vinyl and epoxy. For a<br>
polythioether component that contains reactive functional groups, the average<br>
functionality typically ranges from 2.05 to 3.0, such as from 2.1 to 2.6. A specific<br>
average functionality can be achieved by suitable selection of reactive<br>
ingredients. Examples of suitable polyth/oethers are available from PRC-Desoto<br>
international, Inc., under the trademark PERMAPOL, such as PERMAPOL P-<br>
3.1 E or PERMAPOL P-3. As with the polysulfide component, combinations of<br>
polythioethers can be used to prepare the polythroether component according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
[019] The polymer blends of the present invention can be prepared<br>
according to any standard means known in the art, such as by mixing the<br>
polysulfide component and polythioether component and blending in a standard<br>
mixer such as a cowls mixer or planetary mixer. The ratio of polysulfide<br>
component to polythioether component in the blend can range from 10:90 to<br>
90:10. A 50:50 ratio is particularly suitable for some embodiments. The<br>
molecular weight of the present polymer blend is typically from 1000 to 8000,<br>
such as 3500 to 4500, as measured theoretically or using GPC. The Tg of the<br>
polymer blend is typically ~70°C or lower, such as -60°C or lower. The viscosity<br>
of the blend will typically be lower than the viscosity of a polysulfide having a<br>
comparable molecular weight; this contributes to the ease of handling of the<br>
present compositions and may minimize if not eliminate the need for solvents.<br>
1020] The polymer blend in the present compositions typically<br>
comprises 10 to 50 weight percent, such as 20 to 30 weight percent, with weight<br>
percent based on the weight of the total preformed composition.<br>
[021] In certain embodiments, the preformed composition of the present<br>
invention further comprises a suitable curing agent. The term "curing agent"<br>
refers to any material that can be added to accelerate the curing or gelling of the<br>
polymer blend. In some embodiments, the curing agent is reactive at 10°C to<br>
80°C. The term "reactive" means capable of chemical reaction and includes any<br>
level of reaction from partial to complete reaction of a reactant. in certain<br>
embodiments, a curing agent is reactive when it provides for cross-linking or<br>
gelling of a sulfur-containing polymer. "Cure" refers to the point at which the<br>
composition achieves a cure hardness of 30 Durometer "A" as measured<br>
according to ASTM D2240.<br>
 [022] In certain embodiments, the preformed composition comprises a<br>
curing agent that contains oxidizing agents that oxidize terminal mercaptan<br>
groups in the polymer blend. Useful curing agents include lead dioxide,<br>
manganese dioxide, calcium dioxide, sodium perborate monohydrate, calcium<br>
peroxide, zinc peroxide, dichromate and epoxy. Other suitable curing agents<br>
may contain reactive functional groups that are reactive with the functional<br>
groups in the polymer blend. Examples include but are not limited to polythiols,<br>
such as polythioethers; polyisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate,<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate, and mixtures and isocyanurate derivatives thereof;<br>
and polyepoxides. Examples of polyepoxides include hydantoin diepoxide,<br>
Bisphenol-A epoxides, Bisphenol-F epoxides, Novolac-type epoxides, aliphatic<br>
polyepoxides, and epoxidized unsaturated and phenolic resins. The term<br>
"polyepoxide" refers to a material having a 1,2-epoxy equivalent greater than one<br>
and includes monomers, oligomers, and polymers. Cure accelerators or<br>
retardants can also be used, such as a dimethylene/thiuram/polysulfide mixture<br>
cure accelerator or a stearic acid cure retarder, which will retard the rate of cure<br>
thereby extending the "pot life" of the composition. To control the properties-of<br>
the composition, one or more materials capable of at least partially removing<br>
moisture from the composition, such as molecular sieve powder.<br>
[023] The preformed compositions of the present invention can also<br>
comprise one or more additives. "Additives" refer to non-reactive components in<br>
the preformed composition that provides a desired property. Examples of<br>
additives include but are not limited to fillers, adhesion promoters, and<br>
plasticizers. Fillers useful in the present compositions, especially for aerospace<br>
applications, include those commonly used in the art, such as carbon black,<br>
calcium carbonate (CaCO3), silica, nylon and the like. Potting compound fillers<br>
illustratively include high band gap materials such as zinc sulfide and inorganic<br>
barium compounds. In one embodiment, the compositions include about 10 to<br>
about 70 weight percent of the selected filler or combination of fillers, such as<br>
about 10 to 50 weight percent based upon the total weight of the composition. In<br>
one embodiment, a combination of mica and polyamide are used as the filler<br>
component.<br>
[024] Mica is a silicate characterized by basal cleavage that imparts<br>
flexibility to laminas. Micas include natural muscovite, phlogopite, and biotite, as<br>
well as synthetic fluorophlogopite and barium disilicic. Preparation of synthetic<br>
micas is described in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 13, pp. 398-<br>
424, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1967). Mica provides flexibility and pliability to the<br>
preformed composition and reduces the tack, Polyamide powder provides<br>
viscosity and reduces the tack of the preformed composition. Polyamide resins<br>
can be produced by the condensation reaction of dimerized fatty acids, such as<br>
dimerized linoleic acid, with lower aliphatic polyamines, such as for example,<br>
ethylene diamine or diethylene triamine, so that the final product has multiple<br>
amide groups in the resin backbone. A process for the manufacture of<br>
polyamide resins is disclosed in U,S. Patent No. 2,450,940. Polyamide resins<br>
. suitable for the preformed composition are solid at use temperature and typically<br>
have a number average molecular weight of at least 10,000 Daltons.<br>
[025] In certain embodiments, mica and polyamide together form 10<br>
percent by weight to 50 percent by weight of the total weight of the preformed<br>
composition with substantially equal amounts of mica and polyamide.<br>
"Substantially equal" means that the amount of mica and the amount of<br>
polyamide are present in an amount of less than 5 percent of each other. The<br>
amount of mica can range from 5 percent by weight to 25 percent by weight and<br>
the amount of polyamide from 5 percent by weight to 25 percent by weight. In<br>
one embodiment, the amount of mica ranges from 10 percent by weight to 20<br>
percent by weight and the amount of polyamide ranges from 10 percent by<br>
weight to 20 percent by weight of the total weight of the preformed composition.<br>
[026] One or more adhesion promoters can also be used. Suitable<br>
adhesion promoters include phenolics such as METHYLON phenolic resin<br>
available from Occidental Chemicals, organosilanes such as epoxy, mercapto or<br>
amino functional silanes such as A-187 and A-1100 available from Osi<br>
-9-<br>
Specialties. An adhesion promoter can be used in an amount from 0.1 to <br>
weight percent based upon total weight of the formulation.<br>
[027] A plasticizer can be used in the present compositions in an<br>
amount ranging from 1 to 8 weight percent based upon total weight of the<br>
formulation. Useful plasticizers include phthalate esters, chlorinated paraffins,<br>
hydrogenated terphenyls, etc,<br>
{028] The formulation can further comprise one or more organic<br>
solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol, in an amount ranging from 0 to 15 percent<br>
by weight on a basis of total weight of the formulation, such as less than 15<br>
weight percent or less than 10 weight percent.<br>
[029] Compositions of the present invention can also optionally include<br>
other additives standard in the art, such as pigments; thixotropes; retardants;<br>
catalysts; and masking agents.<br>
[030] Useful pigments include those conventional in the art, such as<br>
carbon black and metal oxides. Pigments can be present in an amount from<br>
. about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent based upon total weight of the formulation.<br>
[031] Thixotropes, for example fumed silica or carbon black, can be<br>
used in an amount from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent based upon total<br>
weight of the formulation,<br>
[032] The curing agent will generally comprise 2 to 30 weight percent of<br>
the total composition such as 5 to 20 weight percent, with weight percent based<br>
on the total weight of the composition, in general, the equivalent ratio of curing<br>
agent to polymer blend may range from 0.5:1 to 2.0:1. A cure accelerator, if<br>
used, can be present in an amount ranging from 1 to 7 weight percent, a cure<br>
retarder, if used, in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 1 weight percent, and a<br>
moisture remover, if used, in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 weight percent,<br>
with weight percent based on the total weight of the curing agent composition.<br>
[033] When used, additives can comprise up to 50 weight percent of<br>
the total weight of the preformed composition.<br>
[034] In certain embodiments, the preformed compositions of the<br>
present invention are prepared as two pack or "2K" systems, in which the<br>
polymer blend is in one component, referred to herein as the base composition,<br>
and the curing agent is In the other component, referred to herein as the curing<br>
agent composition, The base composition and curing agent composition are<br>
mixed just prior to use.<br>
[035] The present invention is also directed to a preformed composition<br>
in shaped form comprising a polymer blend comprising at feast one polyepoxide<br>
component and at least one polythloether component, and at least one<br>
electrically conductive filler. An "electrically conductive filler" is a filler that, when<br>
added to a formulation, imparts electrical conductivity and/or EMI and/or RFI<br>
shielding to the formulation. Examples of such fillers include electrically<br>
conductive noble metal-based fillers such as pure silver; noble metal-plated<br>
noble metals such as silver-plated gold; noble metal-ptated non-noble metals<br>
such as silver plated cooper, nickel or aluminum, for example, silver-plated<br>
aluminum core particles or platinum-plated copper particles; noble-metal plated<br>
glass, plastic or ceramics such as silver-plated glass microspheres, noble-metal<br>
plated aluminum or noble-metal plated plastic microspheres; noble-metal plated<br>
mica; and other such noble-metal conductive fillers. Non-noble metal-based<br>
materials can also be suitable including non-noble metal-plated non-noble<br>
metals such as copper-coated iron particles or nickel plated copper; non-noble<br>
metals, e.g., copper, aluminum, nickel, cobalt; and non-noble-metal-plated-non<br>
metals, e.g., nickel-plated graphite and non-metal materials such as carbon<br>
black and graphite. Combinations of the conductive fillers can also be used to<br>
meet the desired conductivity, EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness, hardness and<br>
other properties suitable for a particular application.<br>
[036] The shape and size of the electrically conductive fillers is not<br>
critical to preformed compositions of the invention. The fillers may be of any<br>
shape generally used in the manufacture of conductive materials, including<br>
spherical, flake, platelet, irregular or fibrous, such as milled or chopped fibers. In<br>
making preformed compositions in shaped form, in accordance with certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, the composition may comprise conductive fillers<br>
and radar absorbing materials having various shapes. For example, the shape<br>
of the conductive fillers may be spherical, substantially spherical, or irregular.<br>
[037] Carbon fibers, particularly graphitized carbon fibers, can be used<br>
to impart electrical conductivity to preformed compositions of the invention.<br>
Carbon fibers formed by vapor phase pyrolysis methods and graphitized by heat<br>
treatment and which are hollow or solid with a fiber diameter of from 0.1 micron<br>
to several microns have high electrical conductivity. As disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No, 6,184,280, carbon microfibers, nanotubes or carbon fibrils having an outer<br>
diameter of less than 0.1 micron to tens of nanometers can be used as<br>
electrically conductive fillers. An example of graphitized carbon fiber suitable for<br>
conductive preformed compositions of the invention is PANEX 30MF, a 0.921<br>
micron diameter round fiber having an electrical resistivity of<br>
0,00055 Q-centimeter (cm).<br>
[038] The average particle size of the electrically conductive fillers can<br>
be within the range normally used for fillers in conductive materials. In certain<br>
embodiments, the particle size of the one or more fillers is from about 0.25<br>
microns to about 250 microns, and in other embodiments from about 0.25<br>
microns to about 75 microns, and in still other embodiments from about 0.25<br>
microns to about 60 microns. In certain embodiments, the preformed<br>
composition of the invention comprises Ketjen Black EC-600 JD (Akzo Nobel), a<br>
conductive carbon black characterized by an iodine absorption of 1000-11500<br>
mg/g (JO/84-5 test method), and a pore volume of 480-510 cm3/100 gm (DBF<br>
absorption. KTM 81-3504). In other embodiments, the carbon black filler is<br>
Black Pearls 2000 (Cabot Corporation),<br>
[039] In certain embodiments, electrically conductive polymers can be<br>
used to impart or modify the electrical conductivity of preformed compositions of<br>
the invention. Polymers having sulfur atoms incorporated into aromatic groups<br>
or adjacent to double bonds, such as in polyphenylene sulfide and<br>
polythiophene, are known to be electrically conductive. Other electrically<br>
conductive polymers include polypyrroles. polyaniline, poly(p-phenylene)<br>
vinyfene, and polyacetylene. All of these can be used according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
[040] In certain embodiments, electrically conductive preformed<br>
compositions of the invention comprise electrically conductive materials ranging<br>
from 2 percent to 50 percent by weight of the total weight of the electrically<br>
conductive preformed composition.<br>
[041 ] Galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metal surfaces and the electrically<br>
conductive compositions of the invention can be minimized or prevented by<br>
adding corrosion inhibitors to the composition, and/or by selecting appropriate<br>
conductive fillers. Corrosion inhibitors include, for example, strontium chromate,<br>
calcium chromate, magnesium chromate, and combinations thereof, aromatic<br>
triazoles and a sacrificial oxygen scavenger such as Zn; other suitable corrosion<br>
inhibitors are known in the art. In certain embodiments, the corrosion inhibitor<br>
comprises less than 10 percent by weight of the total weight of the electrically<br>
conductive preformed composition. In other embodiments, the corrosion<br>
inhibitor comprises an amount ranging from 2 percent to 15 percent by weight of<br>
the total weight of the electrically conductive preformed composition. Corrosion<br>
between dissimilar metal surfaces can also be minimized or prevented by the<br>
selection of the type, amount, and properties of the conductive fillers comprising<br>
the preformed composition.<br>
[042] In certain embodiments, a base composition can be prepared by<br>
batch mixing at least one polysurfide, at least one polythioether, additives, and/or<br>
fillers in a double planetary mixer under vacuum. Other suitable mixing<br>
equipment includes a kneader extruder, sigma mixer, or double "A" arm mixer.<br>
For example, a base composition can be prepared by mixing at least one<br>
polysulfide, at least one polythioether polymer, plasticizer, and phenolic<br>
adhesion promoter, After the mixture is thoroughly blended, additional<br>
constituents can be separately added and mixed using a high shear grinding<br>
blade, such as a Cowls blade, until cut it. Examples of additional constituents<br>
that can be added to a base composition include corrosion inhibitors, nonconductive<br>
fillers, electrically conductive fiber, electrically conductive flake, and<br>
silane adhesion promoters. The mixture can then be mixed for an additional 15<br>
to 20 minutes under a vacuum of 27 inches of mercury or greater to reduce or<br>
remove entrapped air and/or gases. The base composition can then be<br>
extruded from the mixer using a high-pressure piston ram.<br>
[043] The curing agent composition can be prepared by batch mixing<br>
the curing agent and other additives. In certain embodiments, 75 percent of the<br>
total plasticizer such as partially hydrogenated terphenyi and an accelerant such<br>
as a dipentamethylene/thiuram/polysulfide mixture are mixed in a single-shaft<br>
anchor mixer. Molecular sieve powder is then added and mixed for 2 to 3<br>
minutes. Fifty percent of the total manganese dioxide is then mixed until cut in.<br>
Stearic acid, sodium stearate, and the remaining plasticizer are then mixed until<br>
cut in followed by the remaining 50 percent of the manganese dioxide which is<br>
mixed until cut in. Fumed silica is then mixed until cut In. If the mixture is too<br>
thick, a surfactant may be added to increase wetting. The curing agent<br>
composition is then mixed for 2 to 3 minutes, passed over a three-roll paint mill<br>
to achieve a grind, and returned to the single-shaft anchor mixer and mixed for<br>
an additional 5 to 10 minutes. The curing agent composition can then be<br>
removed from the mixer with a piston ram and placed into storage containers<br>
and aged for at least five days prior to combining with a base composition.<br>
[044] The base composition and curing agent composition are mixed<br>
together to form the preformed composition just prior to use. Any suitable<br>
means for mixing can be employed, For example, the base composition and<br>
curing agent composition can be combined in the desired ratio using meter mix<br>
equipment fitted with a dynamic mix head. Pressure from the meter mix<br>
equipment forces the base and curing agent compositions through the dynamic<br>
mix head and an extrusion die. In certain embodiments the preformed<br>
composition is extruded into a laminar form including a tape or sheet. The<br>
preformed composition in sheet form can be cut to any desired shape such as<br>
the shape defined by the dimensions of an aperture to be sealed. In certain<br>
embodiments, the shaped form can be coiled with release paper separating each<br>
ring for packaging purposes. The shaped form is then refrigerated by placing the<br>
shaped form on a bed of dry ice and placing another layer of dry ice on the top of<br>
the shaped form. The shaped form is refrigerated immediately after mixing the<br>
base composition and the curing agent composition. The shaped form remains<br>
exposed to the dry ice for 5 to 15 minutes and Is then placed at a storage<br>
temperature of -40°C or lower. The term "refrigerated" refers to reducing the<br>
temperature of the preformed composition so as to retard and/or stop the curing<br>
of the preformed composition. Typically, the preformed composition in shaped<br>
form is refrigerated below ~40°C.<br>
[045] In certain embodiments, the temperature of the preformed<br>
composition is raised to a use temperature ranging from 4°C to 32°C (40°F to<br>
90°F) prior to application. This is done such that the preformed composition<br>
reaches use temperature for no more than 10 minutes prior to application.<br>
[046] In certain embodiments the preformed composition in shaped<br>
form can be used to seal an aperture between a removable access panel and<br>
the surface adjacent to the perimeter of an opening in an aircraft fuselage.<br>
Adhesion promoter is first brushed on the perimeter of the access panel opening <br>
after the surface has been cleaned with a cleaning solvent such as<br>
DESOCLEAN. The surface of the access panel is then cleaned and coated with<br>
a release agent prior to applying the preformed composition. The preformed<br>
composition in shaped form is manually applied to the surface adjacent to the<br>
perimeter of the access panel opening, to the surface adjacent to the perimeter<br>
of the access panel, or to both. The access panel is then put in place and<br>
clamped down forcing the excess preformed composition around the edges of<br>
the access panel. Excess preformed composition is easily removed by using, for<br>
example, a flat surface. Excess preformed composition can be removed either<br>
prior to curing or after the preformed composition has cured, and preferably after<br>
the preformed composition cures.<br>
[047] The integrity, moisture resistance and fuel resistance of the seal<br>
resulting from application of preformed compositions of the present invention can<br>
be evaluated by performing the tests identified in specification MMS 332. An<br>
acceptable seal will be tight and resistant to moisture and aircraft fuel.<br>
 [048] In addition to ease of handling and use, the present compositions<br>
may cause minimal corrosion to conductive surfaces in the environments<br>
encountered in aviation and aerospace applications. Because the present<br>
polymer btends have both a polysulfide and a polythioether component, they are<br>
compatible with other sealants or coating layers having one or the other of these<br>
technologies. They also exhibit good solvent resistance,<br>
[049] It is noted that, as used in this specification and the appended<br>
claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and, "the" include plural referents unless<br>
expressly and unequivocally limited to one referent. Thus, for example,<br>
reference to "a filler" includes one or more filters. Also it \s noted that, as used<br>
herein, the term "polymer" is meant to refer to prepolymers, polymers, oligomers,<br>
homopoiymers, and copolymers.<br>
[050] For the purposes of this specification and appended claims,<br>
unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or<br>
percentages or proportions of other materials, reaction conditions, and so forth<br>
used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all<br>
instances by the term "about". Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the<br>
numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims<br>
are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought<br>
to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt<br>
to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims,<br>
each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of<br>
reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[051] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting<br>
forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values<br>
set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any<br>
numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting<br>
from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
Moreover, ail ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any<br>
and all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "10 to 50"<br>
includes any and all sub-ranges between (and including) the minimum value of<br>
10 and the maximum value of 50, that is, any and all sub-ranges having a<br>
minimum value of equal to or greater than 10 and a maximum value of equal to<br>
or less than 50, e.g., 25 to 50,<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
[052] The following example is intended to illustrate the invention, and<br>
should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
Example 1<br>
[053] Example 1 provides an electrically conductive preformed<br>
composition in shaped form exhibiting EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness. The<br>
following materials were mixed in the proportions according to Table I to provide<br>
an electrically conductive base composition: PERMAPOL P 3.1 polythioether<br>
polymer from PRC-DeSoto International, Inc., THIOPLAST G4 polysulfide<br>
polymer from Akcros Chemicals (New Brunswick, New Jersey), phenolic resin<br>
adhesion promoter from PRC-DeSoto International, Inc., and HB-40 modified<br>
polyphenyl plasticizer from Solutia, Inc. (St. Louis, Missouri). Using a high shear<br>
grinding blade (Cowls blade), the following materials were individually added and<br>
blended until cut in: calcium chromate corrosion inhibitor (Wayne Pigment<br>
Corp., Milwaukee, Wisconsin), hydrophobic fumed silica (R202. from<br>
Aerosil/Degussa, Diamond Bar, California), Ni fiber (30 urn diameter, 500 Mm<br>
length; from Intramicron, Birmingham. Alabama), Ni-coated graphite (I) (60% Nicoated<br>
graphite; from Novamet, Wyckoff, New Jersey), Ni-coated graphite (II)<br>
(60% Ni-coated graphite; from Sulzer Metco/Ambeon, Switzerland), mercapto<br>
silane adhesion promoter (Silane A189; GE Specialty Materials, Wilton, CN). and<br>
epoxy silane adhesion promoter (Silane A187; GE Specialty Maten'als, Wilton,<br>
CN).<br>
(Table Removed)  [054] Separately, the following materials were mixed in the amounts<br>
according to Table II to form a curing agent composition: manganese dioxide<br>
from EaglePicher (Phoenix, Arizona), partially hydrogenated terphenyl, stearic<br>
acid, fumed silica, sodium stearate from Witco Chemicals, molecular sieve<br>
powder to remove excess moisture from the curing agent, and<br>
dipentamethylene/thiuram/polysulfide mixture from Akrochem Corporation<br>
(Akron, Ohio) to acceterate the cure. The curing agent composition was allowed<br>
to set or age fro at least five days before combining with the base composition.<br>
(Table Removed) [055] One hundred parts by weight of the electrically conductive base<br>
composition according to Table I, and 10 parts by weight of the curing agent<br>
composition of Table II were combined to prepare the electrically conductive<br>
preformed composition. After thorough mixing and degassing, the electrically<br>
conductive preformed composition thus formed was extruded into a tape form<br>
and refrigerated at -40°C.<br>
[056] The surface adjacent to the perimeter of an aircraft access panel<br>
was first coated with low VOC epoxy primer according to specification MMS-423<br>
and cured. The surface was cleaned and then coated with adhesion promoters<br>
PR-148 or PR-184 from PRC-DeSoto International, Inc. The access panel was<br>
made from titanium alloy conforming to AMS-T-9046. After the refrigerated<br>
electrically conductive preformed composition equilibrated to use temperature,<br>
4°C to 32°C (40°F to 90°F), the electrically conductive preformed composition in<br>
tape form was manually applied to the surface adjacent to the perimeter of the<br>
access panel. The access panel was put in place to cover the access opening<br>
and clamped down, forcing the excess electrically conductive preformed<br>
composition around the edges of the access panel to fill the aperture. Excess<br>
electrically conductive preformed composition was easily removed. After 3 to 4<br>
hours at a temperature of 4°C to 32°C (40°F to 90°F), a tight seal, resistant to<br>
moisture and aircraft fuel, resulted.<br>
 [057] The cured sealant exhibited a sheet resistance (four-point probe)<br>
of less than 0.50 Q/cm. Seals to apertures between an aluminum test fixture<br>
and a carbon/epoxy lid exhibited shielding effectiveness from 1 MHz to 200 MHz<br>
when tested in an anechoic chamber. Similarly sealed apertures also exhibited<br>
shielding effectiveness from 0.1 GHz to 18 GHz when tested in a stirred mode<br>
chamber.<br>
[058J Whereas particular embodiments of this invention have been<br>
described above for purposes of illustration, it will be evident to those skilled in<br>
the art that numerous variations of the details of the present invention may be<br>
