				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to a process for the manufacture of synthesis gas by partial oxidation of a liquid hydrocarbon-containing fuel using a multi-orifice (co-annular) burner.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to a process for partial oxidation of a liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel such as oil residue wherein an oxygen-containing gas which is applied as an oxidizer, and a liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel are supplied to a gasification zone through a multi-orifice (co-annular) burner comprising a concentric arrangement of n passages or channels coaxial with the longitudinal axis of said burner, wherein n is an integer &gt; 3, and wherein autothermically a gaseous stream containing synthesis gas is produced under appropriate conditions.<br>
The oxygen-containing gas which is applied as an oxidizer, is usually air or (pure) oxygen or steam or a mixture thereof. Further, in order to control the temperature in the gasification zone a moderator gas (for example steam, water or carbon dioxide or a combination thereof) can be supplied to said zone.<br>
Those skilled in the art will know the conditions of applying oxidiser and moderator.<br>
Synthesis gas is a gas comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and it is used, for example, as a fuel gas or as a feedstock for the synthesis of methanol, ammonia or hydrocarbons, which latter synthesis yields gaseous hydrocarbons and liquid hydrocarbons such as gasoline, middle distillates, lub oils and waxes.<br>
In the specification and in the claims the term liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel will be used to refer to hydrocarbon-containing fuel that is a liquid, an emulsion or a pumpable slurry at gasifier feed pressure and temperature.<br>
'Phis includes, for example, butanes, pentanes, hexanes and on<br><br>
up through the entire liquid range including natural gasolines, kerosenes, gas oils, naphthas, diesel fuels, crude oils, residua, whether atmospheric or vacuum, coal tars, tar sand oils, shale oils, as well as hydrocarbons which may contain other atoms, such as oxygen; however, in such proportions as not to interfere with self-sustaining combustion. Included by definition are slurries of solid carbonaceous fuels in the aforesaid liquid hydrocarbons.<br>
According to an established process, synthesis gas is produced by partially oxidizing in a reactor vessel a fuel such as liquid hydrocarbon, in particular heavy oil residue, at a temperature in the range of from 1000 째C to 1800 째C and at a pressure in the range of from 0.1 MPa to 6 MPa abs. with the use of an oxygen containing gas.<br>
Synthesis gas will often be produced near or at a crude oil refinery because the produced synthesis gas can directly be applied as a feedstock for the production of middle distillates, ammonia, hydrogen, methanol or as a fuel gas, for example, for heating the furnaces of the refinery or more efficiently for the firing of gas turbines to produce electricity and heat.<br>
In co-annular (multi-orifice) oil burners it has appeared that the burner lifetime is restricted by serious corrosion caused by flame phenomena occurring on the burner tips. By means of such phenomena the temperature of the burner-internals becomes too high and serious burner damage will occur.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a process for partial oxidation of a liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel wherein the mixing of the oxygen-containing gas applied as oxidizer and hydrocarbon-containing fuel is achieved beyond the exit of the burner downstream and the flame is lifted from the front of the burner and wherein burner-damage by serious corrosion (high heat load) is suppressed.<br>
The invention solves the above burner damage problem in that in the process of the invention the oxygen-containing gas applied as oxidizer and the liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel are supplied to the getfiification zone through the respective channels of the said<br><br>
burner in such a manner that, in use, the oxygen-containing gas applied as oxidizer and the liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel are always separated by a moderator and are flowing for some time as separate streams outside the burner front.<br>
In this manner, flames occurring on the internal rims are removed and the burner-internal blades that form the internal separation wall between the passages of the burner and have a finite thickness, are remaining relatively cool and the fuel-oxidizer mixture close to the burner exit is less reactive which reduces the heat load on the internal rims.<br>
Accordingly the present invention therefore provides a process for the manufacture of synthesis gas by reacting oxygen containing gas, applied as oxidizer, hereafter called "X", moderator gas, hereafter called "M", and liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel, hereafter called "F" in a reaction zone of a substantially non-catalytic gas generator at a temperature in the range of from lOOO'C to 1800"'C and at a pressure in the range of from O.lMpa to 12Mpa abs. comprising the steps of injecting the said fuel and the said oxidizer into the reaction zone through a multi-orifice (co-annular) burner comprising an arrangement of n separate passages or channels coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the said burner wherein n is an integer &gt; 3 (3,4,5...), wherein the (n-l)th passage is the inner passage with respect to the nth passage, measured from the longitudinal axis of the said burner, and wherein<br><br>
F is passed through one or more of the passages, whereby at least 2 passages remain, X is passed through one or more of the remaining passages, whereby at least 1 passage remains, and M is passed through one or more of the remaining passages in such a way that any passage through which F is passed and any passage through which X is passed are separated by at least one passage through which M is passed.<br>
Advantageously, the liquid, hydrocarbon-containing fuel is an oil residue with a viscosity between 1 and 1000 cSt and passes through one or more of the passages at a velocity or velocities between 2 and 40 m/s; the oxygen-containing gas (oxidizer) passes through one or more of tht* remaining passages at a velocity or velocities between 20 and 140 m/s; and the moderator gas passes_<br><br>
through one or more of the remaining passages at a velocity or velocities between 5 and 140 m/s.<br>
More advantageously, either oxygen-containing gas (oxidizer) or moderator gas is passed through the outermost passage.<br>
Still more advantageously, in case of n &gt; 4, moderator gas is also passed through the outermost passage.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the invention, with n &gt; 4, oxygen-containing gas oxidizer or moderator gas is also passed through the innermost passage.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention the respective velocities are measured or calculated at the outlet of the said respective channels into the gasification zone. The velocity measurement or calculation can be carried out by those skilled in the art in any way suitable for the purpose and will therefore not be described in detail.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the invention the moderator gas is steam and/or water and/or carbon dioxide. In still another advantageous embodiment of the invention the gasification process is carried out at a pressure of 0.1-12 MPa abs.<br>
Multi-orifice burners comprising arrangements of annular concentric channels for supplying oxygen-containing gas (oxidizer), fuel and moderator to a gasification zone are known as such (vide e.g. EP-A-0,545,281 and DE-OS-2,935,754) and the mechanical structures thereof will therefore not be described in detail.<br>
Usually such burners comprise a number of slits at the burner outlet and hollow wall members with internal cooling fluid (e.g. water) passages. The passages may or may not be converging at the burner outlet. Instead of comprising internal cooling fluid passages, the burner may be provided with a suitable ceramic or refractory lining applied onto or suspended by a means closely adjacent to the outer surface of the burner (front) wall for resisting the heat load during operation or heat-up/shut down situations of the burner. Advantageously, the exit(s) of one or more passages may be retracted or protruded.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail by reference<br><br>
to the following examples.<br>
