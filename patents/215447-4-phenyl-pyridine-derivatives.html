n	is 0 - 4; and<br>
m	is 1 or 2;<br>
and to pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic properties. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.<br>
The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a number of diverse biological processes.<br>
The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson"s disease (Neurosci. Res., 1996. 7,187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and depression (Science, 1998,281,1640-1645).<br>
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer"s disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", J. Auton. Pharmacol., 13, 23-93,1993.<br>
Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of<br><br>
tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).<br>
The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment induced vomiting.<br>
In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195,1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-l-receptor antagonist.<br>
Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmunologic or a psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor antagonist.<br>
Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I and pharma-ceutically acceptable salts thereof, the preparation of the above-mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above-mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention ofcertain depressive disorders or emesis by the administration of NK-1 receptor antagonists. A major depressive episode has been defined as being a period of at least two weeks during which, for most of the day and nearly every day, there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all, or nearly all activities.<br>
The following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1-7 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl and the like. Preferred lower alkyl groups are groups with 1-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "lower alkoxy" denotes a group wherein the alkyl residues are as defined above, and which is attached via an oxygen atom.<br>
The term "halogen" denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine.<br><br>
The term "cycloalkyl" denotes a saturated carbocyclic group, containing 3-6 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "cyclic tertiary amine" denotes, for example, pyrrol-1-yl, imidazol-1-yI, piperidin-l-yl, piperazin-1-yl, morphoIin-4-yl, thiomorpholin-4-yl, 1-oxo-thiomorpholin-4-yl or 1l-dloxo-tliiomorphohn-4-yl.<br>
The term "5 or 6 membered heterocyclic group" denotes, for example pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, furyl, pyranyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isothiazolyl, piperazinyi or piperidyl.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceuticaily usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter.<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the NKi receptor was evaluated at human NKj receptors in CHO cells infected with the human NKi receptor (using the Semlilci virus expression system) and radiolabelled with [ H]substance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %) leupeptin (8 fig / ml), MnCl2 (3mM) and phosphoramidon (2 )a.M). Binding assays consisted of 250 |al of membrane suspension (1.25x10" cells / assay tube), 0.125 \il ofbuffer of displacing agent and 125 f.ilof [ H]substance P. Displacement curves were determined with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered under vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min with PEI (0.3%) with 2 x 2 ml washes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4).

The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi¬solid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br><br>
Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyol? etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide hmits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of general formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.<br>
