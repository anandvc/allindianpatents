Liver-X-Receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The LXRs are activated by endogenous oxysterols and regulate the transcription of genes controlling multiple metabolic pathways. Two subtypes, LXRalpha and LXRbeta, have been described (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.1994, 91:10809-13). LXRbeta is ubiquitously expressed, while LXRalpha is predominantly expressed in cholesterol metabolizing tissues such as the liver, adipose, intestine and macrophage. The LXRs modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of cholesterol absorption, cholesterol elimination (bile acid synthesis), and transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues via plasma lipoproteins to the liver. The LXRs are also involved in glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism in the brain, cell differentiation, and inflammation.<br>
At present, approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The atheroprotective function of HDL was first highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL-C levels (Miller NE., Lipids 1978,13:914-9). The protective function of HDL derives from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues, including macrophage foam cells in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL delivers its cholesterol to the liver and sterol-metabolizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination in feces. Studies have shown that HDL-C levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (Gordon et al., Am J Med. 1977, 62:707-14).<br>
At present, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7 % (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial unfavorable side-effects limit the therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
It has been observed that as many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the United State;, are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. Studies have shown that the prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in women. The rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, and for HDL-C 
The first line of treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes at present generally involves a low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies becomes necessary with lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia, and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists, for insulin resistance. Recent studies provide evidence that modulators of LXRs would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, and as such, modulators of LXRs should improve the plasma lipid profile, and raise HDL-C levels (Lund et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 2003, 23:1169-77). LXRs are also known to control the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage foam cell of the atherosclerotic lesion, and agonists of LXRs have been shown to be atheroprotective (Joseph and Tontonoz, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003, 3:192-7). Thus, modulators of LXRs would be effective treatments for the atherosclerotic disease which underlies the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of stroke and heart disease. Recent observations also suggest that there is an independent LXR mediated effect on insulin-sensitization in addition to its role in atheroprotection (Cao et al., J Biol Chem. 2003, 278:1131-6). Thus LXR modulators can also show superior therapeutic efficacy on HDL-raising and atheroprotection, with additional effects on diabetes, compared to current therapies.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention have been found to bind to and selectively activate LXR -alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and LXR beta. Consequently, cholesterol absorption is reduced, HDL cholesterol is increased, and inflammatory atherosclerosis is reduced. Since multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia and cholesterol homeostasis are addressed by LXR modulators, novel compounds of the present invention have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art. They can therefore be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists. Such diseases include increased lipid and cholesterol levels, particularly low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and inflammatory diseases such as colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis/fibrosis of the liver, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases of the skin, and diseases that have an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's disease or impaired/improvable cognitive function. Moreover, the novel compounds of the present invention can be used for treatment and prophylaxis of age-related and inherited (e.g. Stargardt's disease) forms of macular degeneration.<br>
Other compounds that bind to and activate LXR alpha and LXR beta have previously been suggested (e.g.: WO 03/099769). However, there is still a need for new compounds with improved properties. The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which bind to LXR alpha and/or LXR beta. The compounds of the present invention unexpectedly exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to the compounds known in the art, concerning e.g. metabolic stability, bioavailability and activity.<br>

It will be appreciated that the compounds of general formula (I) in this invention may be derivatised at functional groups to provide derivatives which are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for the manufacture of compounds of formula (I) as defined above, which process comprises<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula (II)<br>
(Formula II Removed)<br>
with a compound LG-R ,<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X, m and n are as defined above, A is hydrogen or a protecting group and LG is a leaving group (such as e.g. I, Br, Cl, triflate, mesylate, tosylate),<br>
or<br>
b) reacting a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
(Formula III Removed)<br>
with a compound LG-X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4,<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, X, m and n are as defined above, A is hydrogen or a protecting group, LG is a leaving group (such as e.g. I, Br, Cl, or, if X is a single bond, LG can also be e.g. triflate, mesylate, tosylate),<br>
and removing the protecting group A.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (II) with a compound LG-R1 and removing of the protecting group A if necessary can be carried out under conditions well known to the person skilled in the art. Such reactions of a compound of formula (II) can conveniently be carried out after treatment with a strong base such as e.g. lithium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide or in some cases in the presence of a base such as e.g. DBU in a solvent such as e.g. THF or DMF at a suitable temperature. The reaction of a compound of formula (III) with a compound LG-X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4, and removing of the protecting group A if necessary can be carried out under conditions well known to the person skilled in the art. Such reactions of a compound of formula (III) can conveniently be carried out in the presence of a base such as e.g. NEts in a solvent such as e.g. dichloromethtane or THF at a suitable temperature. The protecting group is removed using standard deprotection methods commonly known in the art, such as e.g. desilylation using TBAF.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined above, when prepared by a process as described above.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by methods known in the art or as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, X, m and n are as described above.<br>
Preparation of derivatives in which R1 is hydrogen is carries out as described below in scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Aniline la may be O-protected to Ib (step a) with a suitable protecting group "PG" such as e.g. a triethylsilyl or a t-butyldimethylsilyl group by treatment with a silylating agent (e.g. triethylsilylchloride or f-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, respectively) in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. DBU, imidazole). Unprotected aniline la or protected aniline Ib maybe converted to a ca. 1:1-trans/cis-mixture of cyclohexanes 2a and 2b, respectively, by hydrogenation in a suitable solvent such as AcOH, methanol or ethanol in the presence of a catalyst such as e.g. Pt on charcoal or PtCO2 under acidic conditions (step b). Filtration and evaporation of the solvent leads to 2a or 2b in the form of their ammonium salts with the deprotonated acid as counter anion. The free amines can be obtained by basic work up (e.g. distribution between an aqueous NaOH-<br>
solution and AcOEt). The free amines of the trans and cis isomers trans-2b and cis-2b may be separated by chromatography (step c).<br>
The introduction of the "X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4"-moiety (step d) leading to derivatives 3a, 3b or trans-3b or m-3b can be carried out by one of the methods described below. To obtain compounds 3a, 3b, trans-3b or c/s-3b in which X = single bond, 2a, 2b, trans-2b or cis-2b may be treated with an aldehyde CHO-(CH2)m_i-(CR2R3)n-R4 (wherein m =1-3) in presence of a reducing agent such as e.g. NaBCNH3 in a suitable solvent such as e.g. ethanol or methanol. The use of a ketone R3-CO-R4 instead of CHO-(CH2)m.i-(CR2R3)n-R4 leads to derivatives with X = single bond, m = 0, n = 1 and R = H. Alternatively 2a, but preferably 2b, trans-2b, or cis-2b may be treated with an alkylating agent LG-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4, wherein LG is a leaving group such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, OSO2aryl, OSO2CH3, OSO2CF3. Such alkylations are preferably carried out in presence of a base (e. g. K2CO3) in a suitable solvent such as e.g. acetonitrile, DMF, DMA or THF. To obtain compounds 3a, 3b, trans-3b or cis-3b in which X = CO, COO, CONR5, or SO2, 2a, 2b, trans-2b or cis-2b may be treated with a chloride Cl-X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 in the presence of a suitable base such as e.g. DIPEA, NEt3 or N-methylmorpholine. For X = CO and SO2, 3a, 3b, trans-3b or c/s-3b may also be obtained by treatment with a carboxylic acid HOCO-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 or a sulfonic acid HOSO2-(CH2)nr(CR2R3)n-R4 in the presence of a typical peptide coupling reagent such as e.g. EDCI or DCC (if required in combination with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole) in a suitable solvent (e.g. dichloromethane, THF or DMF). Compounds 3a, 3b trans-3b or c/s-3b in which X = CONH may also be obtained by treatment of 2a, 2b, trans-2b or cis-2b with an isocyanate O=C=N-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4. Derivatives in which R3 = hydroxy, X = single bond, and m = 1, can be prepared by treatment of 2 a, 2b , trans-2b or cis-2b with an oxirane 4.<br>
7ra/ts-3a, trans-3b and the corresponding cis analogues can be obtained whenever desired or required from 3a and 3b, respectively, by chromatography (step e). Removal of the protecting group (step f) is carried out according to commonly known standard procedures such as described e.g. in "Protective groups in organic chemistry" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts, 2nd Ed., 1991, N.Y. (e.g. desilylation using tetrabutylammonium fluoride).<br>
Preparation of derivatives in which R1 is lower alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, lower-alkyl-carbonyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl-carbonyl, aryl-lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl-carbonyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl-carbonyl is carried out by one of the methods described below in scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Treatment of 2a, 2b, tmns-2a, trans-2b, cis-2a or cis-2b with an acylating agent such as e.g. an acylchloride R'-Cl or an acid anhydride (R1)2O, wherein R1 = lower-alkyl-carbonyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl-carbonyl, cycloalkyl-carbonyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl-carbonyl in the presence of a base such as DIPEA, NEt3 or N-methylmorpholine in a solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane, THF or DMF leads to derivatives 5a, 5b, trans-5a, trans-5b cis-5a or cis-5b (step g). Alternatively these acylations may be carried out with the carboxylic acid in the presence of a typical<br>
peptide coupling reagent such as e.g. EDCI or DCC (if required in combination with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole) in a suitable solvent (e.g. dichloromethane, THF or DMF).<br>
Optionally the carbonyl group can be subsequently removed by treatment with a reducing agent such as e.g. BH3 in a solvent such as THF leading to derivatives 5a, 5b, trans-5a, trans-5b, cis-5a or cis-5b with R1 = lower alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl (step h). These latter derivatives may also be obtained by treatment of 2a, 2b, trans-2a, trans-2b cis-2n or cis-2b with a suitable aldehyde or ketone in the presence of a reducing agent such as e.g. NaBCNH3 (step i) or by<br>
o<br>
treatment with an alkylating agent such as lower-alkyl-LG, fluoro-lower-alkyl-LG, aryl-lower-alkyl-LG, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl-LG, wherein LG is a leaving group such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, OSO2aryl, OSO2CH3, OSO2CF3 (step j). The treatment with the alkylating agent is carried out preferably in presence of a base (e.g. DBU, K2CO3) or after deprotonation of 2a, 2b, trans-2a, trans-2b, cis-2a, cis-2b, with a strong base (e.g. lithium bis (trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide). The same methods g-j can be used to convert 3a, 3b, trans-3a, trans-3b, cis-3a, cis-3b, into 6a, 6b, trans-6%, trans-6b, cis-6a, cis-6b, respectively. Foroderivatives 5a, 5b, trans-5a, trans-5b, cis-5a or cis-5b in which R1 is restricted to R1 = lower alkyl, fluoro-lower-alkyl, aryl-lower-alkyl, cycloalkyl-lower-alkyl, the "X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4-moiety can be introduced by one of the methods described in step d of scheme 1 (step k).<br>
Deprotonation of derivatives 6b, trans-6b or cis-6b with X = SO2, CO, m = 1 and n = 0 with a strong base (e.g. lithium bis (trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide) and subsequent treatment with O2, lower-alkyl-LG, aryl-lower-alkyl-LG, heterocyclyl-lower-alkyl-LG (wherein LG is a leaving group such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, OSO2aryl, OSO2CH3, OSO2CF3) leads to derivatives 6b, trans-6b or cis-6b with R3 = hydroxy, lower-alkyl, aryl-lower-alkyl, heterocyclyl-lower-alkyl, respectively, and X = SO2, CO, m = 0, andn=l.<br>
Derivatives 6 or trans-6b or cis-6b with X = SO2, CO, m = 0 and n = 1 may also be deprotonated with a strong base such as e.g. lithium bis (trimethylsilyl)amide or lithium diisopropylamide and subsequently be treated with a alkylating agent "lower alkyl-LG" (wherein LG is a leaving group such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, OSO2aryl, OSO2CH3, OSO2CF3) to give derivatives 6, trans-6b or cis-6b with X = SO2, CO, m = 0, n = 1 and R2 = lower alkyl.<br>
Trans-5a, trans-5b, trans-6a, trans-6b and the corresponding cis analogues can be obtained whenever desired or required from 3a and 3b, respectively, by chromatography (step 1). Removal of the protecting group (step m) is carried out<br>
according to cor monly known standard procedures such as described e.g in "Protective group:; in organic chemistry" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts, 2nd Ed., 1991, N.Y. (e.g. desilylation using tetrabutylammonium fluoride).<br>
A large number of the compounds Cl-X-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4, CHO-(CH2)m.,-(CR2R3)n-R4', LG-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 are commercially available. If not, they may be prepared from a related commercially available starting material such as e.g. an ester alkylOCO-(CH2)m-1-(CR2R3)n-R4, a carboxylic acid HOCO-(CH2)m.1-(CR2R3)n-R4, an alcohol HO-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 or for X = SO2 e.g. a sulfonic acid HOSO2-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 according to standard literature procedures commonly known to those of the art. A selection of three typical examples for such transformations are e.g.: 1) the tranformation of a carboxylic acid HOCO-(CH2)m.1-(CR2R3)n-R4 into the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride C1-CO-(CH2) m.1(CR2R3)n-R4 by treatment with e.g. SOC12 or POCb in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane; 2) the oxidation of an alcohol HO-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4n into an aldehyde CHO-(CH2)m.r(CR2R3)n-R4 (e.g. by a Swern-oxidation); 3) the transformation of an alcohol HO-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 into a derivative LG-(CH2)m-(CR2R3)n-R4 using e.g. PBr3 to obtain the derivative with LG = Br, or using e.g. methanesulfonylchloride (in the presence of a base such as e.g. NEt3) to obtain the derivative with LG = OSO2CH3.<br>
Epoxides 4 - if not commercially available - may be be obtained by epoxidation of an alkene CH2=CR3R4 with a commonly used epoxidizing agent such as e.g. meta chloro perbenzoic acid in a suitable solvent such as e.g. dichloromethane.<br>
If 3a, 3b, 6a, 6b, trans-3a, trans-3b, trans-6a, trans-6b, cis-3a, cis-3b, cis-6a or cis-6b contain a functional group not compatible with one of the transformations described above, this functional group may be suitably protected prior to the transformation(s) and deprotected again at a later stage. Such protections and deprotections are carried out according to standard literature procedures as described e.g. in "Protective groups in organic chemistry" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts, 2nd Ed., 1991, N.Y." and are commonly known to those of the art.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with an inorganic acid, for example a hydrohalic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, or other inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid etc., or with an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or /?-toluenesulfonic acid. One method to form such a salt is e.g. by addition of 1/n equivalents of the acid, wherein n<br>
= number of acidic protons on the acid, to a solution of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, ethanol-water mixture, tetrahydrofuran.-water mixture) and to remove the solvent by evaporation or lyophilisation. Compounds of formula (I) can further form salts with physiologically compatible bases. Examples of such salts are alkaline, earth-alkaline and ammonium salts such as e.g. Na-, K-, Ca- and trimethylammoniumsalt. One method to form such a salt e.g. is by addition of 1/n equivalents of a basic salt such as e.g. M(OH)n, wherein M = metal or ammonium cation and n = number of hydroxide anions, to a solution of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, ethanol-water mixture, tetrahydrofurane-water mixture) and to remove the solvent by evaporation or lyophilisation.<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula (I) into pharmaceutically acceptable esters can be carried out e.g. by treatment of suited amino or hydroxy groups present in the molecules with an carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, with a condensating reagent such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), N,N-dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) or O-(l,2-dihydro-2-oxo-l-pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium-tetrafluorborate (TPTU) to produce the carboxylic ester or carboxylic amide. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters can also be prepared by treatment of suited carboxy groups present in the molecules with a suited alcohol using e.g. one of the condensating agents mentioned above.<br>
Insofar as their preparation is not described in the examples, the compounds of formula (I) as well as all intermediate products can be prepared according to analogous methods or according to the methods set forth above. Starting materials are commercially available or known in the art.<br>
As described above, the novel compounds of the present invention have been found to bind to and selectively activate I..XR alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and LXR beta. Consequently, cholesterol absorption is reduced, HDL cholesterol is increased, and inflammatory atherosclerosis is reduced. They can therefore be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists. Such diseases include increased lipid and cholesterol levels, particularly low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and inflammatory diseases such as colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis/fibrosis of the liver, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases of the skin, and diseases that have an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's disease or impaired/improvable cognitive function. Moreover, the novel compounds of the present invention can be used for treatment and prophylaxis of age-related and inherited (e.g. Stargardt's disease) forms of macular degeneration.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or adjuvant.<br>
The invention likewise embraces compounds as described above for use as therapeutically active substances, especially as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease, which method comprises administering a compound as defined above to a human being or animal.<br>
The invention also embraces the use of compounds as defined above for the therapeutic and/or prophylact.c treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of compounds as described above for the preparation of medicaments for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease. Such medicaments comprise a compound as described above.<br>
Prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, atherosclerotic diseases, dyslipidemia, or diabetes is the preferred indication, particularly prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, atherosclerotic diseases, or dyslipidemia, especially prevention and/or treatment of atherosclerotic diseases or dyslipidemia. Diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, is another preferred disease.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the ac i ivity of the compounds of the present invention. Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", Anal Biochem. 1998,257: 112-119.<br>
Mammalian expression vectors were constructed to express full-length human LXR alpha and LXR beta. Bacterial expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of human LXR alpha (aa 164 to 447) and human LXR beta (aa 155 to 460). To accomplish this, the portions of the sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.1994, 91:10809-13).<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
LXR alpha and LXR beta receptor binding were assayed in buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. For each 96-well reaction, 500 ng of GST-LXRa-LBD or 700 ng of GST-LXR beta-LBD fusion proteins were bound to 80 (ig or 40 ug SPA beads (Pharmacia Amersham) respectively, in a final volume of 50 |il by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for 1 h at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300 X g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed, and the semi-dry pellet containing the receptor-coated beads was re-suspended in 50 (xl of buffer. Radioligand (eg. 100,000 dpm of (N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-N-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1 -hydroxy-1 -trifluoromethylethyl)-phenyl] -benzenesulfonamide)) was added, and the reaction incubated at RT for 1 h in the presence of test compounds, and then scintillation proximity counting was performed. All binding assays were performed in 96-well plates and the amount of bound ligand was measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Dose response curves were measured within a range of concentration from 10-10 M to 10-4 M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%O2 5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the full-length-LXRα or full-length-LXRp expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid expressing luceriferase under the control of LXR response elements . Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 μl of the supernatant was discarded and then 50 μl of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence, as a measure of luciferase activity, was detected in a Packard TopCount. Transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-change in luminescence compared to that of cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) have an activity in at least one of the above assays (EC50 or IC50) of 1 nM to 100 μM, preferably 1 nM to 10 μM, more preferably 1 nM to 1 μM.<br>
For example, the following compounds showed the following IC50 values in the binding assay:<br>
These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.<br>
The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in tae form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual<br>
requirements in each p trticular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 2000 mg, especially about 1 to 500 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The   pharmaceutical   preparations   conveniently   contain   about   l-500mg, preferably 1-200 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
The following Examples serve to illustrate the present invention in more detail. They are, however, not intended to limit its scope in any manner.<br>
