HETEROCYCLYLALKYLPIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SAME<br>
The present invention relates to heterocyclyl-alkylpiperidine derivatives of general formula:<br><br>
which are active as antimicrobial agents. The invention also relates to their preparation and to compositions containing them.<br>
Patent applications WO 99/37635 and WO 00/43383 disclose antimicrobial quinolylpropylpiperidine derivatives of general formula:<br><br>
in which the radical R1 is especially (Cl-6) alkoxy, R2 is hydrogen, R3 is in position -2 or -3 and represents (Cl-6) alkyl which may optionally be substituted with 1 to 3 substituents chosen from thiol, halogen, alkylthio, trifluoromethyl, carboxyl, alkyloxycarbonyl,<br><br>
alkylcarbonyl, alkenyloxycarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl, hydroxyl optionally substituted with alkyl, etc., R4 is a group -CH2-R5 for which R5 is selected from alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, tetrahydrofuryl, optionally substituted phenylalkyl, optionally substituted phenylalkenyl, optionally substituted heteroarylalkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl, etc., n is 0 to 2, m is 1 or 2 and A and B are especially oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, NRn, CReR7 for which R6 and R7 represent H, thiol, alkylthio, halo, trifluoromethyl, alkenyl, alkenylcarbonyl, hydroxyl, amino, and Z1 to Z5 are N or CR1a, etc. These products show antimicrobial activity. However, no derivative disubstituted in position -4 of the piperidine had been synthesized hitherto and consequently no biological activity had been discovered for such products either.<br>
Since slight modifications to the structures already known can result in large variations in activity, it was not obvious that derivatives disubstituted in position -4 of the piperidine would also have antibacterial activity.<br>
European patent application EP 30044 discloses quinoline derivatives which are useful as cardiovascular agents, corresponding to the general formula:<br><br><br>
in which R1 is especially alkyloxy, A-B is -CH2-CH2-, -CHOH-CH2-, -CH2-CHOH-, -CH2-CO- or -CO-CH2-, Ri is H, OH or alkyloxy, R2 is ethyl or vinyl, R3 is especially alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, hydroxyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, tetrahydrofuryl, phenylalkyl, optionally substituted diphenylalkyl, optionally substituted phenylalkenyl, optionally substituted benzoyl or benzoylalkyl, optionally substituted heteroaryl or heteroarylalkyl, and Z is H or alkyl or forms with R3 a cycloalkyl radical.<br>

phenylalkylsulfonyl, phenylalkylamino, N-alkyl-N-phenylaminoalkyl, N-cycloalkyl-N-phenylalkylamino, benzoyl, mono- or bicyclic aromatic heterocyclyl, heterocyclyloxy, heterocyclylthio, heterocyclylsulfinyl, heterocyclylsulfonyl, heterocyclylamino, N-alkyl-N-heterocyclylamino, N-<br>
cycloalkyl-N-heterocyclylamino, heterocyclylcarbonyl, heterocyclylalkyloxy, heterocyclylalkylthio, heterocyclylalkylsulfinyl, heterocyclylalkylsulfonyl, heterocyclylalkylamino, N-alkyl-N-heterocyclylaminoalkyl, N-cycloalkyl-N-heterocyclylaminoalkyl, (the heterocyclyl portions mentioned above being mono- or bicyclic aromatic), carboxyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, -NRaRb or -CO-NRaRb for which Ra and Rb are defined as above in the definition of R2, or alternatively R°3 represents -CR'b=CR'c-R'a for which R'a represents phenyl, phenylalkyl, heterocyclyl or heterocyclylalkyl in which the heterocyclyl portion is mono- or bicyclic aromatic, phenoxyalkyl, phenylthioalkyl, phenylsulfinylalkyl, phenylsulfonylalkyl, phenylaminoalkyl, N-alkyl-N-phenylaminoalkyl, heterocyclyloxyalkyl, heterocyclylthioalkyl, heterocyclylsulfinylalkyl, heterocyclylsulfonylalkyl, heterocyclylaminoalkyl, N-alkyl-N-heterocyclylaminoalkyl, heterocyclylthio, heterocyclylsulfinyl, heterocyclylsulfonyl, (the heterocyclyl portions mentioned above being mono- or bicyclic aromatic), phenylthio, phenylsulfinyl,<br><br>

n is an integer from 0 to 4 it being understood that the phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl or heterocyclyl radicals or portions mentioned above may optionally be substituted on the ring with 1 to 4<br><br>
substituents chosen from halogen, hydroxyl, alkyl, alkyloxy, alkyloxyalkyl, haloalkyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethylthio, carboxyl, alkyloxycarbonyl, cyano, alkylamino, -NRaRb for which Ra and Rb are defined as above, phenyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, alkylsulfinylalkyl and alkylsulfonylalkyl,<br>
in their enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric forms or mixtures of these forms, and/or, where appropriate, in their syn or anti form or a mixture thereof, as well as the salts thereof, are powerful antibacterial agents.<br>
It is understood that the alkyl or acyl radicals and portions contain (except where especially mentioned) 1 to 10 carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain and that the cycloalkyl radicals contain 3 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
It is also understood that the radicals which represent or bear a halogen atom represent a halogen chosen from fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preferably fluorine.<br>
In the above general formula, when the radicals represent or bear a mono- or bicyclic aromatic heterocyclyl substituent, this substituent contains 5 to 10 chain members and may be chosen {in a nonlimiting manner) from thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl,<br><br>
indolyl, benzothienyl, benzofuryl indazolyl, benzothiazolyl, naphthyridinyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, cinnolyl, quinazolyl, quinoxalyl, benzoxazolyl and benzimidazolyl which may optionally be substituted with the substituents listed above.<br>
According to the invention, the products of general formula (I) may be obtained by coupling the chain R3 with the heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula:<br><br>
in which X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, R1, R2, Y and n are defined as above, and R2 is protected when it bears a carboxyl or amino radical, optionally followed by removal of the acid-protecting or amine-protecting radical, optional separation of the enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric forms and/or, where appropriate, of the syn or anti forms and optional conversion of the product obtained into a salt.<br>
The coupling of the chain R3 with the piperidine is advantageously carried out by the action of a derivative of general formula:<br>
R3-X (IIa)<br><br>
in which R3 is defined as above and X represents a halogen atom, a methylsulfonyl radical, a trifluoromethylsulfonyl radical or a p-toluenesulfonyl radical, working in anhydrous medium, which is preferably inert (for example nitrogen or argon) in an organic solvent such as an amide (for example dimethylformamide), a ketone (for example acetone) or a nitrile (for example acetonitrile) in the presence of a base such as an organonitrogen base (for example triethylamine) or a mineral base (alkaline carbonate, for example potassium carbonate) at a temperature of between 2 0°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent. It is understood that the nitrogen atom of the piperidine in the derivative of general formula (II) is optionally protected according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule or the reaction; for example, the protection is carried out by a protecting radical chosen from t-butoxycarbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl. Preferably, a derivative of general formula (Ila) for which X is a bromine or iodine atom is reacted.<br>
When R3 is a phenyl radical, it is also possible to act on the iodo or bromo derivative R3-X in the presence of a palladium catalyst according to the method described in J. Org. Chem., 6066 (1997) or Tet. Lett., 6359 (1997). The palladium catalyst may be chosen from tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium, and palladium diacetate with a ligand such as 2,2'-bis(diphenyl-<br><br>
phosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl or 2-(di-t-butylphosphino)-biphenyl, for example, a base such as sodium tert-butoxide or cesixim carbonate in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, tetraglyme or toluene, optionally in the presence of a crown ether such as 18-C-6 (1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of between 20°C and llO°C.<br>
When R3 represents a radical -alk-R°3 for which alk is an alkyl radical and R°3 represents -C=C-Rd in which Rd is phenyl, phenylalkyl, heterocyclyl or mono- or bicyclic aromatic heterocyclylalkyl, it is often preferable to couple an alkynyl halide: HC=C-alk-X for which alk is defined as above and X is a halogen atom, and then to substitute the chain with a phenyl, phenylalkyl, heterocyclyl or heterocyclylalkyl radical.<br>
In this alternative, the addition of the alkynyl chain is carried out using an alkynyl halide HC=C-alk-X for which X is preferably a bromine atom, under the conditions listed above for the coupling of the chain R3, in the presence or absence of an alkali metal iodide such as, for example, potassium iodide or sodium iodide.<br>
The substitution with a phenyl or heterocyclyl radical is carried out by the action of a halide derived from the cyclic radical to be substituted, in the presence of triethylamine, in anhydrous medium in a solvent such as an amide (for example dimethylformamide)<br><br>
or a nitrile (for example acetonitrile) and in the presence of a palladium salt such as, for example, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and cuprous iodide, at a temperature of between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The substitution with a phenylalkyl or heterocyclylalkyl radical is carried out by the action of the corresponding halide, in basic medium, for example in the presence of potassium hydride or sodium hydride or n-butyllithium, in a solvent such as an ether (tetrahydrofuran) or an amide (dimethylformamide) at a temperature of between -60°C and the boiling point of the reaction medium.<br>
It is understood that, if the alkyl radicals represented by R3 bear carboxyl or amino substituents, these substituents are protected beforehand then freed after the reaction. The process is performed according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, in particular according to the methods described by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (2nd edition), A. Wiley -Interscience Publication (1991), or by McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press (1973).<br>
The protected carboxyl radical borne by R2 may be chosen from readily hydrolyzable esters. Examples which may be mentioned are the methyl, benzyl and tert-butyl esters, or the phenyl propyl or allyl esters. The<br><br>
protection of the carboxyl radical is optionally carried out at the same time as the reaction.<br>
Where appropriate, the amino radical is protected using the usual protecting radicals mentioned in the above references.<br>
These protecting radicals are installed and removed according to the usual methods, mentioned above for R3.<br>
When R3 represents a radical-alk-R°3 for which alk is an alkyl radical and R°3 represents a phenoxy, phenylthio, phenylamino, heterocyclyloxy, heterocyclylthio or heterocyclylamino radical in which the heterocyclyl portion is aromatic, it may be preferable to construct the chain step by step by first condensing a chain HO-alk-X, for which X is a halogen atom and preferably iodine, under the conditions described above for the reaction of the product of general formula (Ila) , and then by converting the hydroxyalkyl chain into a haloalkyl, methanesulfonylalkyl or p-toluenesulfonylalkyl chain, and finally by reacting, in basic medium, an aromatic derivative of structure Ar-ZH for which AR is an aromatic phenyl or heterocyclyl radical and Z is a sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen atom.<br>
The conversion of the hydroxylated chain into a haloalkyl or p-toluenesulfonyl chain is carried out according to the usual methods of halogenation or sulfonylation, especially by reacting a halogenating<br><br>
agent, for instance, thionyl chloride, halophosphorus derivatives: for example phosphorus trichloride or tri-bromide or a sulfonylating agent such as, for example, methanesulfonyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent, for instance a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane or chloroform), at a temperature of between O°C and 60°C. In certain cases, it may be advantageous to work in the presence of a base, for instance pyridine or triethylamine.<br>
The reaction of the aromatic derivative Ar-ZH is advantageously carried out as described above for the action of the derivative of general formula (Ila), in the presence of a base, .for example such as a nitrogenous base, in an organic solvent such as an amide (for example dimethylformamide), a ketone (for example acetone) or a nitrile (for example acetonitrile), in the presence of a base such as a nitrogenous organic base (for example triethylamine) or a mineral base (alkali metal carbonate: for example potassium carbonate) at a temperature of between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. It may be advantageous to work in the presence of potassium iodide.<br>
According to the invention, the heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivatives of general formula (II) may be prepared according to the coupling<br><br>
method described below, and then where appropriate converted according to one of the methods ® to (D below, via a subsequent operation starting with one of the derivatives of general formula (II) already obtained, to prepare the derivatives corresponding to the various alternatives of Y and/or of R1, R'l, R'2, R'3, R'4 or R'5.<br>
It is understood that when carboxylic acid radicals are present on the molecule, these radicals are protected beforehand and then freed after the reaction according to the usual methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, especially according to the methods mentioned in the references cited above. It is also understood that, prior to the reactions which may interfere with the amine of the piperidine in the derivative of general formula (11), this amine is protected, and then freed after the reaction. The protection is carried out according to the usual methods, as specified above, especially via a t-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl radical.<br>
According to the invention, the preparation of the products of general formula (II) for which Re in Y is a hydrogen atom is carried out by coupling a heterocyclic derivative of general formula:<br><br><br><br>
in which Rz is a protecting radical and R"2 is defined as above or represents a protected radical if R2 represents or bears a carboxylic acid function, followed by removal of the protecting radicals and/or followed by conversion, via a subsequent operation, of the substituents of the bicycle of the heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula (II) thus obtained, to give the expected derivative bearing the radical R1, R'l, R'2, R'3, R'4or R'5, and, where appropriate, removal of the protecting radical(s) still present on  the molecule.<br>
The radical Rz may be any protecting group for the nitrogen atom which is compatible with the reaction (for example t-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl). The protecting groups for the acid functions are chosen from the usual groups whose installation and removal do not affect the rest of the molecule, especially those mentioned in the references cited above.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out by the successive action of an organoborane (for example 9-borabicyclo-[3.3.l]nonane) in a solvent such as an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane) at a temperature of between -20°C and 20°C, and then of the bicyclic derivative of general formula (III) for which Hal preferably represents a bromine or iodine atom or a chlorine atom, by analogy with the methods described by Suzuki et al, Pure and Appl. Chem. , 57,   1749 (1985). The reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a palladium salt (for example diphenylphosphinoferrocenepalladium chloride) and of a base such as potassium phosphate, at a temperature of between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
® The heterocyclylalkylpiperidines of general formula (II) for which Re in Y represents a hydroxyl radical may be prepared by oxidation in basic medium of the corresponding heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula (II) for which Re in Y is a hydrogen atom. The oxidation is carried out by the action of oxygen, preferably in an inert solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of tert-butanol and of a base such as potassium tert-butoxide or sodium tert-butoxide at a temperature of between O°C and lOO°C.<br>
The heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative for which Re in Y is a fluorine atom is prepared by fluorination starting with a derivative for which Re is<br><br>
hydroxyl. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a sulfur fluoride [for example in the presence of an aminosulfur trifluoride (diethylaminosulfur trifluoride<br>
(Tetrahedron, £4, 2875 (1988), bis(2-methoxyethyl)aminosulfur trifluoride (Deoxofluor®) , or morpholinosulfur trifluoride, for example) or alternatively in the presence of sulfur tetrafluoride (J, Org. Chem. , 40,   3808<br>
(1975)]; alternatively, the fluorination reaction can also be carried out using a fluorinating agent such as hexafluoropropyldiethylamine (JP 2 039 546) or N-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)diethylamine. The process is performed in an organic solvent such as a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane, dichloroethane or chloroform) or in an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane) at a temperature of between -78°C and 40°C (preferably between 0°C and 30°C)- It is advantageous to work in inert medium (especially argon or nitrogen).<br>
The heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula (II) for which Re in Y is an alkyloxy or cycloalkyloxy radical is prepared by the action of an alkyl or cycloalkyl halide on the corresponding derivative of general formula (II) for which Re is hydroxyl. The reaction is generally carried out using the bromide or chloride, in an inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, in the presence of an acid acceptor such as a trialkylamine (for example<br><br>
triethylamine) or an alkali metal hydride (for example sodium hydride), at a temperature of between 2 0°C and<br>
l00°c.<br>
The heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula (II) for which Y is a carbonyl radical may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding derivative of general formula (II) for which Re in Y is a hydroxyl radical. This oxidation is carried out, for example, using potassium permanganate optionally in a solution of sodium hydroxide (for example 3N sodium hydroxide), at a temperature of between -20°C and 20°C, or alternatively by the action of oxalyl chloride in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by the addition of an amine such as triethylamine, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide, at a temperature of between -60°C and 20°C, by analogy with the method described by D. Swern et al., J. Org. Chem., 44, 4148 (1979).<br>
The heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivative of general formula (II) for which Y is a difluoromethylene radical may be prepared by dihalogenation of the product of general formula (II) for which Y is carbonyl, under conditions analogous to those of the fluorination described above.<br>

The halogenation reaction is carried out in a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane or chloroform), at a temperature of between O°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The reaction of the alkaline cyanide may be carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide, an amide (for example dimethylformamide), a ketone (for example acetone), an ether (for example tetrahydrofuran) or an alcohol (for example methanol or ethanol), at a temperature of between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The nitrile is hydrolyzed according to the conventional methods which do not affect the rest of the molecule, especially by the action of hydrochloric acid in methanolic medium, at a temperature of between 20°C and 70^C, followed by saponification of the ester obtained (for example with sodium hydroxide in a mixture of dioxane and water), or<br><br>
directly by the action of aqueous sulfuric acid at a temperature of between 50°C and 80^C.<br>
The piperidine derivatives of general formula<br>
(IV) for which n and Rz are defined as above and R"2 represents a 2-carboxyethyl radical may be prepared from the derivative of general formula (IV) for which R"2 represents a hydroxymethyl radical via the halo derivative (prepared as described above) and then coupling with the sodium salt of diethyl malonate followed by acidic hydrolysis in aqueous medium of the product obtained.<br>
The piperidine derivatives of general formula<br>
(IV) for which n and Rz are defined as above and R"2 represents carboxyhydroxymethyl or carboxycarbonyl may be prepared by homologation of the piperidine derivative of general formula:<br><br><br>
between -50°C and 10°C. The intermediate dicyanophosphate obtained is then hydrolyzed in acidic medium (for example concentrated hydrochloric acid) in a polar solvent (for example water) at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The derivatives for which R"2 is carboxycarbonyl are obtained by oxidation of the corresponding ester, by adapting the methods described by Burhardt et al,, Tetrahedron Lett., 29, 3433 (1988) followed by hydrolysis of the product obtained. In particular by the action of an oxidizing agent such as triacetoxy-1,1-dihydro-l,2-benziodoxol-3(IH)one in a solvent such as a nitrile or a chlorinated derivative (for example acetonitrile or dichloromethane) at a temperature of between 0°C and 40°C, followed by hydrolysis by the action of a base (for example sodium hydroxide) in an aqueous-alcoholic solvent<br>
(for example water-methanol) at a temperature of between 20°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The piperidine derivatives of general formula<br>
(IV) for which n and Rz are defined as above and R"2 represents -CF2-RC may be prepared by the action of a fluorinating agent on a piperidine derivative of general formula (IV) for which R"2 is a radical -CO-Rc, Rc being an ester, by analogy with the methods described by M. Parisi et al,, J. Org. Chem, 60, 5174 (1995), optionally followed by hydrolysis of the ester if it is desired to obtain a piperidine derivative for which Re is carboxyl. The fluorinating conditions are similar to those<br><br>
described above for the preparation of derivatives for which Re in Y is a fluorine atom. The hydrolysis is carried out by the action of a base in an aqueous-alcoholic solvent under the conditions described above. The piperidine derivatives of general formula (IV) for which n and Rz are defined as above and R"2 represents a radical -CH=CH-Rc may be prepared by oxidation to aldehyde of the derivative of general formula (TV) for which R"2 represents a hydroxymethyl radical by adapting the methods described in Org. Synth. Coll., Vol. II, p. 541, Coll. Vol. 5 p. 242 followed by conversion to a derivative for which R"2 is -CH=CH-Rc in which Re is an ester, by applying the Wittig method optionally followed by hydrolysis of the ester obtained to an acid. The oxidation is carried out by the action of an oxidizing agent (for example potassium dichromate) in acidic medium (for example sulfuric acid) in a polar solvent (for example water) or chromium oxide in the presence of a base (for example pyridine) in a chlorinated solvent (for example dichloromethane) at a temperature of between 0°C and 20°C. The conversion to an unsaturated derivative is carried out by adapting the methods described by Johnson in 'Ylid Chemistry" Academic Press (1966) by the action of a phosphorus ylid (for example carbethoxymethylenetriphenylphosphorane) in a hydrocarbon (for example toluene) at a temperature of between 60°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction<br><br>
mixture. The hydrolysis is carried out according to the methods described above.<br>
The piperidine derivatives of general formula (IV) for which n and Rz are defined as above and R"2 represents a radical C(CH3)2Rc or -C (cycloalk) Re may be prepared from a derivative of general formula (IV) for which R"2 is an ester of the acid for which R"2 is -CH2COOH by adapting the methods described by Ashutosh et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 40, 4733 (1999) and Sauers, J. Org. Chem. , 52/ 671 (1992) optionally followed by hydrolysis of the ester obtained. The reaction is carried out in particular by the successive action of an amide (for example lithium diisopropylamide) followed by a methyl halide (for example methyl iodide) or a derivative of formula Hal-Alk-Hal (Hal preferably being a bromine atom) in a polar solvent (for example<br>
hexamethylphosphorotriamide) at a temperature of between 0°C and 60°C.<br>
It is understood that the processes listed above for the preparation of the piperidine derivatives of general formula (IV) may also be applied to the derivatives of general formula (II) if it is preferred firstly to couple the piperidine with the heterocyclic derivative of general formula (III) and then to convert the radical R2 under the conditions described above.<br><br>
It is also understood that the methods described below in the examples also form part of the present invention.<br>
It is understood that the derivatives of general formulae (I) and (II) may exist in enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric forms or in syn or anti form. The enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric and syn or anti forms and the mixtures thereof also fall within the context of the present invention. These forms may be separated according to the usual methods, especially by chromatography on silica or by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivatives of general formula (I) may be purified, where appropriate, by physical methods such as crystallization or chromatography.<br>

As examples of addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, mention may be made of the salts formed with mineral acids (hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates and phosphates) or with organic acids (succinates, fumarates, tartrates, acetates, propionates, maleates, citrates,<br><br>
methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, phenylsulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, isethionates, naphthylsulfonates or camphorsulfonates, or with substitution derivatives of these compounds).<br>
Some of the heterocyclylalkylpiperidine derivatives of general formula (I) bearing a carboxyl radical may be converted into metal salts or into addition salts with nitrogen bases according to the methods that are known per se. These salts also fall within the context of the present invention. The salts may be obtained by the action of a metallic base (for example an alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal), ammonia or an amine, on a product according to the invention, in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol, an  ether or water, or by exchange reaction with a salt of an organic acid. The salt formed precipitates after optional concentration of the solution, and is separated out by filtration, settling or freeze-drying. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts which may be mentioned are the salts with alkali metals (sodium, potassium or lithium) or with alkaline-earth metals (magnesium or calcium), the ammonium salts or the salts of nitrogen bases (ethanolamine, diethanolamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, methylamine, propylamine,<br>
diisopropylamine, N-N-dimethylethanolamine, benzylamine, dicyclohexylamine, N-benzyl-P-phenethylamine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diphenylenediamine.<br><br>

In vivo, they have been found to be active on experimental infections of mice with Staphylococcus aureus  IP8203, either subcutaneously at doses of between 18 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg {DC50) , or orally at doses of between 2 0 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg.<br>
Finally, the products according to the invention are particularly advantageous on account of their low toxicity. None of the products has shown any toxicity subcutaneously at the dose of 100 mg/kg in mice (2 administrations)•<br><br>
