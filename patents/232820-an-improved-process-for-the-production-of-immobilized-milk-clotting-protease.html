				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of immobilized milk clotting protease. The invention particularly relates to a process for the immobilization of milk clotting protease on novel crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - pentaerythritol triacrylate copolymers useful for the preparation of cheese.<br>
k-Casein stabilizes the casein micelles in the milk via protecting against flocculation by Ca++. Milk clotting protease, also referred as rennet, hydrolyses selectively the peptide bond between alanine and methionine at position 105-106 in k-casein to form para-k-casein and a glycopeptide. Thus, the action of milk clotting protease destabilizes the casein micelles and leads to its gelation followed by formation of cheese.<br>
A variety of microorganisms such as Rhizomucor miehei, Rhizomucor  pusillus.  Endothia  parasitica,  Irpex  lacteus, Aspergillus niqer. Kluyveromyces lactis and Escherichia coli are developed for production of milk clotting protease as described in Advances in Applied Microbiology, vol. 20, p. 39-73, 1976 and Biotechnology, vol. 9, 2nd Edition, p. 353-384, 1995. These milk clotting proteases are used instead of calf chymosin. However, microbial milk clotting protease preparations contain nonspecific aspartic proteases at varying degree which causes excessive degradation of cheese proteins. In our copending Application No. 251/BOM/96,  we have described and claimed a process  for production of  milk  clotting protease  by  fermentation  of Aspergillus niqer strain MC4 .  The enzyme preparation contains very low amount of aspartic proteases.<br><br>
Currently, in the process for the production of cheese, milk is incubated with a solution of milk clotting protease at a given temperature for a certain period and the cheese formed is separated by filtration and processed for fortification as described in Biotechnology, vol. 9, 2nd Edition, p.353-384, 1995. Major disadvantage with this process is that the aspartic proteases can not be separated and remain entrapped in the cheese. During storage, the aspartic proteases hydrolyse protein molecules present in the cheese which results in altered flavor and bitter taste thereby reduces the shelf life of cheese. Further, other metabolites secreted by the microorganism are at times, present in the milk clotting protease and contaminate the cheese. To overcome these factors, use of an immobilized milk clotting protease are explored. Milk clotting proteases are immobilized on a number of different types of solid supports such as DEAE-cellulose, AE- cellulose, porous glass, succinic amido propylated glass,  photo-crosslinkable  resin polymer,  paraffin wax, Sepharose 4B, Agarose and alkyl amide sand as described in World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology, vol. 9, p.139-144, 1993. However, these supports are not dedicated to the milk clotting protease and casein micelles system.<br>
Choice of right matrix for immobilization of an enzyme depends on the appropriate pore size and pore size distribution, enzyme properties,  interference or hindrance in the catalytic reaction and mechanical stability at the temperature,  pH and sheer during operation.<br><br>
In our copending Application No.2937/D/97, we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of novel crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - pentaerythritol triacrylate copolymers which are designed to encounter the above mentioned factors and hence are useful for the immobilization of milk clotting protease. The said protease is an enzyme which does not have any nutritional value and hence it is not used as food.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of the immobilized milk clotting protease using crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - pentaerythritol triacrylate copolymers as the polymer matrix.<br>
The other object of the present invention is to obtain the immobilized milk clotting protease free from the metabolites secreted during the fermentation of Aspergillus niger strain MC4<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the production of immobilized milk clotting protease useful for the preparation of cheese, which comprises suspending crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - pentaerythritol triacrylate copolymers, in acetate buffer, adding the milk clotting protease solution obtained in a manner as herein described agitating the immobilization reaction mixture in the range of 90 to 150 rpm, maintaining a temperature in the range of 25 to 28°C for a period ranging from 16 to 20 hours, isolating the immobilized milk clotting protease by fi'tratinn<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the glycidyl methacrylate-pentaerythritol<br>
*<br>
triacrylate copolymer is prepared as described and claimed in our copending Application No.2937/D/97.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the acetate buffer used for suspending the crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate - pentaerythritol triacrylate copolymers may have a molarity from 0.05 to 0.1 having a pH in the range of 3.8 to 4.4.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the acetate buffer used for suspending the immobilized enzyme may be from 0.05 to 0.1 molar and a pH in the range of 3.8 to 4.4.<br>
The activity of milk clotting protease was measured by adding 0.5 ml of the enzyme or 0.5 ml of settled immobilized enzyme beads to 5.0 ml of 10% w/v solution of skim milk powder containing 0.01 M CaCI2. The reaction mixture was incubated at 35°C with with shaking and the time lapsed between the addition and first appearance of solid material was measured. The amount of the enzyme required to clot the milk in one minute is considered to contain 400 u of milk clotting protease as defined in Methods in Enzymology, vol. 19, p. 446-459, 1970.<br>
The       process      of     the      present      invention     is    described    by<br><br>
