				<td>Process for the preparation of perfluoroalkanesufonic acid esters and salts thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds con-<br>
taining perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid radicals, in particular the preparation of per-<br>
fluoroalkanesulfonic acid esters, and to the further conversion thereof into salts,<br>
and to the use of the resultant compounds in electrolytes and in batteries, capaci-<br>
tors, supercapacitors and electrochemical cells.<br>
The spread of portable electronic equipment, such as, for example, laptop and<br>
palmtop computers, mobile telephones or video cameras, and thus also the<br>
demand for lightweight and high-performance batteries has increased dramatically<br>
worldwide in recent years. In view of this sudden increase in demand for batteries<br>
and the ecological problems associated therewith, the development of recharge-<br>
able batteries having a long service life is constantly increasing in importance.<br>
Lithium ion batteries and double-layer capacitors with very high capacities (so-<br>
called super- or ultracapacitors) represent the current state of the art. In both sys-<br>
tems, hydrolysis-sensitive and thermally unstable substances in the form of LiPF6<br>
or N(C2H5)4BF4 are currently used as conductive salt. In contact with moist air or<br>
with residual water from the solvents, HF can form rapidly. Besides the toxic prop-<br>
erties, HF has a very adverse effect on the cycle behaviour and thus on the per-<br>
formance of the electrochemical cells.<br>
Alternatives which have been presented are imides, such as bis(trifluoromethyl-<br>
sulfonyl)imide or bis(pentafluoroethylsulfonyl)imide, or methanides, such as<br>
tris(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)methanide and derivatives thereof. However, quaternary<br>
ammonium and phosphonium salts having perfluoroalkanesulfonate anions have<br>
also been developed as conductive salts for electrochemical cells. However, the<br>
synthesis of these salts is relatively complex, since an intermediate, methyl<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate (methyl triflate), is difficult to prepare.<br>
There are various synthetic routes to methyl triflate (Gramstad, J. Chem. Soc,<br>
1956, 173-180 or Beard, J. Org. Chem., 1973 (21), 3673-3677). However, none of<br>
the synthetic routes described is suitable for scale-up since they either use very<br>
toxic starting materials, such as, for example, dimethyl sulfate, the yields are very<br>
low, the reaction product has to be purified, or hazardous by-products or waste<br>
products are formed, such as, for example, sulfuric acid contaminated with<br>
dimethyl sulfate.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to overcome the disadvantages of<br>
the prior art and to provide a simple and economically effective process for the<br>
synthesis of alkyl perfluoroalkanesulfonates and conductive salts which can be<br>
prepared therefrom.<br>
This object is achieved by the processes according to Claim 1 and Claim 9.<br>
Special process features are described in sub-Claims 2 to 8.<br>
The invention is distinguished by the fact that a perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid is<br>
reacted directly with a dialkyl carbonate to give an alkyl perfluoroalkanesulfonate.<br>
For example, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid can be reacted directly with dimethyl<br>
carbonate. However, the methyl triflate is only formed in low yields (cf. Example 1).<br>
Better yields are obtained in the preferred reaction of a perfluoroalkanesulfonic<br>
acid with a dialkyl carbonate in the presence of a water- or alcohol-consuming<br>
reagent, such as, for example, a carboxylic acid derivative whose organic radical<br>
is stable to perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid, for example<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, a carboxylic acid derivative is a com-<br>
pound in which the hydroxyl group of a carboxylic acid has been replaced by<br>
another functional group, for example a halide, a carboxyl radical or a sulfonyl<br>
radical. For the purposes of the invention, all carboxylic acid derivatives can in<br>
principle be employed so long as their alkyl or aryl radicals - including those con-<br>
taining protons - are stable to perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid.<br>
Surprisingly, the alkylation of the mixture of perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid and car-<br>
boxylic acid derivative takes place easily and results in good yields of alkylated<br>
perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid and carboxylic acid ester. Both compounds can read-<br>
ily be isolated by the person skilled in the art by conventional methods, generally<br>
by fractional distillation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the carboxylic acid derivatives employed for the proc-<br>
ess according to the invention are carboxylic acid halides, in particular chlorides,<br>
carboxylic anhydrides or mixed carboxylic/sulfonic anhydrides. The use of these<br>
starting materials results in good yields of the esters in relatively short reaction<br>
times.<br>
The carboxylic acid chloride is particularly preferably selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of: benzoyl chloride, p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 2,6-difluorobenzoyl chloride,<br>
pentafluorobenzoyl chloride, 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride, 3-chlorobenzoyl chloride, 4-<br>
chlorobenzoyl chloride, 2-bromobenzoyl chloride, 3-bromobenzoyl chloride, 4-<br>
bromobenzoyl chloride, 2,3-dichlorobenzoyl chloride, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl chloride,<br>
2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride, 3,4-dichlorobenzoyl chloride, 3,5-dichlorobenzoyl<br>
chloride and trichloroacetyl chloride.<br>
The carboxylic anhydride is particularly preferably benzoic anhydride, 2,2'-<br>
dichlorobenzoic anhydride, 3,3'-dichlorobenzoic anhydride, 4,4'-dichlorobenzoic<br>
anhydride, 2,2',3,3'-tetrachlorobenzoic anhydride, 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobenzoic<br>
anhydride, 2,2',6,6'-tetrachlorobenzoic anhydride, 3,3'4'4'-tetrachlorobenzoic<br>
anhydride, 3.2',3.5'-tetrachlorobenzoic anhydride, 2-bromobenzoic anhydride,<br>
3-bromobenzoic anhydride, 4-bromobenzoic anhydride or 2,2',6,6'-tetrafluoro-<br>
benzoic anhydride.<br>
The dialkyl carbonate used in accordance with the invention by the person skilled<br>
in the art can in principle be any known dialkyl carbonate. However, it is preferably<br>
selected from the group consisting of dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate,<br>
dipropyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, methyl ethyl carbonate and mixtures of<br>
these dialkyl carbonates.<br>
The process according to the invention is preferably carried out at temperatures<br>
between room temperature and 150°C, in particular between 50 and 110°C, very<br>
particularly preferably between 70 and 100°C. The preferred reaction time is<br>
between 1 and 10 hours, in particular between 2 and 5 hours.<br>
The perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid esters prepared in accordance with the invention<br>
can subsequently be converted further into the corresponding perfluoroalkane-<br>
sulfonic acid salts by reaction with<br><br>
and R3 are identical or different, are optionally linked directly to one<br>
another by a single or double formation and are each, indi-<br>
vidually or together,<br>
- hydrogen<br>
- an alkyl radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, which<br>
may be partially or fully substituted by further groups, pref-<br>
erably by F, Cl, N(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx)2, O(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx),<br>
SO2(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx) or CnF(2n+1-x)Hx where 1 = n = 6 and<br>
0 = x = 2n+1, an unsubstituted or substituted aryl radical or<br>
an unsubstituted or substituted aromatic heterocyclic radi-<br>
cal,<br>
- an alkylaryl radical whose alkylene group has from 1 to 16<br>
carbon atoms and which may be partially substituted by<br>
further groups, preferably by F, Cl, Br, NO2, CN, alkyl, aryl<br>
or heterocyclic aryl,<br>
- an aryl radical, which may be partially substituted by further<br>
groups, preferably by F, Cl, Br, NO2, CN, alkyl, aryl or het-<br>
erocyclic aryl, or<br>
- an aromatic heterocyclic radical, which may be partially<br>
substituted by further groups, preferably by F, Cl, Br, NO2,<br>
CN, alkyl, aryl or heterocyclic aryl,<br>
where one, two or three CH2 groups in an alkyl radical may<br>
have been replaced by identical or different heteroatoms,<br>
preferably O, NH or N(alkyl) having from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms,<br>
and where all three R radicals cannot simultaneously be per-<br>
fluorinated or perchlorinated.<br>
After the reaction, the perfiuoroalkanesulfonic acid salt formed precipitates or can<br>
be isolated by conventional methods. The unreacted alkyl perfluoroalkane-<br>
sulfonate merely has to be distilled off.<br>
This subsequent reaction with the ester is preferably carried out using a compound<br>
XR1R2R3 which is selected from the group consisting of<br>
X(C2H5)3, X(C3H7)3, X(C4H9)3,<br>
where <br>
X and Y are P or N,<br>
R1, R2<br>
and R3 are H, alkyl, preferably having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms,<br>
alkylaryl, aryl or heterocyclic aryl,<br>
where one, two or three CH2 groups in the ring and/or in the alkyl radi-<br>
cal may have been replaced by identical or different heteroatoms, pref-<br>
erably O, NH or N(alkyl) having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and where<br>
the ring and/or the alkyl radical may have been partially substituted by<br>
further groups, preferably by F, Cl, N(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx)2, O(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx),<br>
SO2(CnF(2n+1-x)Hx) or CnF(2n+1-x)Hx where 1=n=6 and 0= x = 2n+1,<br>
alkylaryl, aryl, heterocyclic aryl or heterocyclic allkylaryl.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to the reaction of a perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid<br>
ester obtained in accordance with the invention with a compound XR1R2R3<br>
selected from the following group to give a salt:<br><br>
where R1 to R4 are identical or different, are optionally linked directly to<br>
one another by a single or double bond and are each, individually or<br>
together,<br>
- hydrogen,<br>
- a halogen, preferably fluorine,<br>
with the proviso that there is no N-halogen bond,<br>
- an alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, which may be par-<br>
tially or fully substituted by further groups, preferably F, Cl, N(CnF(2n+1-<br>

- an aryl radical,<br>
- an alkylaryl radical,<br>
- an aromatic heterocyclic radical,<br>
- a heterocyclic allkylaryl radical.<br>
The compounds containing perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid radicals which have been<br>
prepared in accordance with the invention, i.e. the perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid<br>
esters and in particular the salts thereof, can be employed in electrolytes, electro-<br>
chemical cells, primary and secondary batteries, capacitors and/or super- or ultra-<br>
capacitors, for example as solvents or conductive salts. The salts here can be<br>
employed as conductive salts either in pure form or alternatively in the form of their<br>
mixtures. It is also possible to use the salts as conductive salt together with further<br>
salts known to the person skilled in the art. In addition, the perfluoroalkanesulfonic<br>
acid esters are strong alkylating agents and are suitable for the alkylation of<br>
organic compounds, for example in the preparation of medicaments and crop<br>
protection agents.<br>
The compounds containing perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid radicals according to the<br>
invention, in particular the salts, can be used in liquid, gelatinous, polymeric or<br>
solid electrolytes. To this end, mixtures comprising the conductive salts and suit-<br>
able polymers and/or suitable solvents can be employed. For the purposes of the<br>
present invention, the term mixture covers pure mixtures of the components, mix-<br>
tures in which the salt(s) is (are) included in a polymer or gel, and mixtures in<br>
which chemical and/or physical bonds exist between the salt(s) and a polymer or<br>
gel. In the case of a gelatinous electrolyte, the mixture preferably comprises a<br>
suitable solvent in addition to the salt(s) and the polymer.<br>
The solvents employed for liquid or gelatinous electrolytes are particularly prefera-<br>
bly aprotic solvents or mixtures thereof which are suitable for use in primary or<br>
secondary batteries, capacitors, supercapacitors or electrochemical cells, for<br>
example carbonates, esters, ethers, sulfolanes or nitriles, such as, for example,<br>
dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, butylene carbonate, propylene carbonate,<br>
ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, methyl propyl carbonate, 1,2-dimeth-<br>
oxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, methyl acetate, ?-butyrolactone, ethyl acetate,<br>
methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, dimethyl sul-<br>
foxide, dioxolane, sulfolane, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl-<br>
tetrahydrofuran or mixtures thereof.<br>
The polymers employed for polymeric or gelatinous electrolytes are preferably<br>
homopolymers or copolymers of acrylonitrile, vinylidene difluoride, methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene oxide, siloxane, phosphazene or a mix-<br>
ture of at least two of the above-mentioned homopolymers and/or copolymers, it<br>
being possible for the polymers to be at least partially crosslinked.<br>
The complete disclosure content of all applications, patents and publications men-<br>
tioned above and below, and of the corresponding application DE 101 63 458.7,<br>

Even without further comments, it is assumed that a person skilled in the art will be<br>
able to utilise the above description in its broadest scope. The preferred embodi-<br>

All NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker WP 80 SY spectrometer (1H:<br>
80.1 MHz, 19F: 75.5 MHz).<br>
Example 1<br>
19.4 g (0.129 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid are introduced into a round-<br>
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. 5.81 g (0.0646 mol) of dimethyl car-<br>
bonate are added with constant stirring and cooling using an ice bath. The reaction<br>
mixture is subsequently heated at 90°C for 3 hours using an oil bath (temperature<br>
in the oil bath) until the evolution of gas ceases. After the cooling to room tem-<br>
perature, the reaction mixture is distilled at atmospheric pressure. 12.3 g of a<br>
transparent, colourless liquid are isolated (boiling range 100-102°C). This mixture<br>
comprises 96.3% of methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (methyl triflate) and 3.7% of<br>
dimethyl carbonate. The yield of methyl triflate is 55.8%.<br>

19F- and 1H-NMR data correspond to the literature data for methyl triflate (Ency-<br>

5, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 1995, 3618; J. Org. Chem., Vol. 38, No. 21, 1973,<br>
3673-3677)<br>
Example 2<br>
76.36 g (0.509 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid are introduced into a round-<br>
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. 71.60 g (0.509 mol) of benzoyl chlo-<br>
ride are added over the course of 2 minutes with constant stirring. During this<br>
addition, the mixture warms, and gas evolution is observed. Without cooling the<br>
reaction mixture, 45.81 g (0.509 mol) of dimethyl carbonate are added, and the<br>
reaction mixture is subsequently heated at 90°C for 10 hours using an oil bath<br>
(temperature in the oil bath). After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mix-<br>
ture is distilled at atmospheric pressure, giving 75.05 g (89.9%) of methyl<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate (methyl triflate) as a transparent, colourless liquid (boil-<br>
ing range 98-99°C).<br>
19F- and 1H-NMR data for the methyl triflate correspond to the literature data and<br>
the data indicated in Example 1.<br>
A further 49.15 g (0.328 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, 46.10 g (0.328 mol)<br>
of benzoyl chloride and 29.49 g (0.328 mol) of dimethyl carbonate are added to<br>
the distillation residue with stirring. The reaction mixture is subsequently heated at<br>
90°C using an oil bath (temperature in the oil bath) for 6 hours, giving 52.00 g<br>
(yield: 96.8%) of pure methyl triflate by distillation.<br>
The average yield of methyl triflate in the two successive reactions is 92.6%.<br>
After isolation of the methyl triflate, the reaction mixture which remains is distilled<br>
under reduced pressure (boiling range: 89-91 °C at 2.7 kPa), giving 94.92 g<br>
(83.4%) of pure methyl benzoate.<br>
1H-NMR, ppm (solvent: CD3CN, internal standard: TMS): 3.86 s (CH3), 7.52 m<br>
(3H), 8.00 m (2H).<br>
The distillation residue remaining after distillation of the liquids is benzoic acid,<br>
which can be crystallised from ethanol/water (melting point 121-122°C).<br>
Example 3<br>
29.77 g (0.160 mol) of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 15.00 g (0.167 mol) of dimethyl<br>
carbonate and 24.07 g (0.160 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid are mixed in a<br>
round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and heated at about 75°C for 2<br>
hours in an oil bath (temperature in the oil bath) with constant stirring. After cooling<br>
to room temperature, the methyl triflate is distilled off under atmospheric pressure,<br>
giving 18.57 g (yield: 70.6%) of a transparent, colourless liquid (boiling range 98-<br>
99°C).<br>
The solid distillation residue which remains consists principally of methyl p-nitro-<br>
benzoate, which is obtained as a pale-yellow product after crystallisation from<br>
methanol (25.0 g, yield: 86.0%, melting point: 93-94°C).<br>
Example 4<br>
20.84 g (0.139 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid are introduced into a round-<br>
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. 24.69 g (0.139 mol) of 2,6-difluoro-<br>
benzoyl chloride and 12.50 g (0.139 mol) of dimethyl carbonate are added with<br>
constant stirring and with ice cooling. The ice bath is replaced by an oil bath, and<br>
the reaction mixture is heated at 80-110°C for 4 hours (temperature in the oil bath)<br>
with stirring. Gas evolution commences at about 70°C. After completion of the<br>
reaction, the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the methyl triflate is dis-<br>
tilled off under atmospheric pressure, giving 20.63 g (yield: 90.6%) of a transpar-<br>
ent, colourless liquid (boiling range 98-99°C).<br>
The reaction mixture which remains is distilled under reduced pressure (boiling<br>
point: 90°C at 2.0 kPa), giving 21.50 g (yield: 89.4%) of pure methyl 2,6-difluoro-<br>

benzoyl chloride and 9.65 g (0.107 mol) of dimethyl carbonate are added with con-<br>
stant stirring and with ice cooling. The ice bath is replaced by an oil bath, and the<br>
reaction mixture is heated at 80-110°C for 4 hours (temperature in the oil bath)<br>
with stirring. Gas evolution commences at about 75°C. After completion of the<br>

bonate are introduced into a round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser.<br>
2.81 g (0.0187 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid are added with constant stir-<br>
ring and with ice cooling. The ice bath is replaced by an oil bath, and the reaction<br>
mixture is heated at 90-110°C for 4 hours (temperature in the oil bath) with stirring<br>
until the evolution of gas ceases. After completion of the reaction, the mixture is<br>
cooled to room temperature, and the methyl triflate is distilled off under atmos-<br>
pheric pressure, giving 0.55 g (yield: 17.9%) of a transparent, colourless liquid<br>
(boiling range 99-100°C).<br>
The reaction mixture which remains is distilled under reduced pressure (boiling<br>
range: 88-93°C at 2.0 kPa), giving 3.96 g (yield: 77.8%) of virtually pure methyl<br>
benzoate.<br>

5 minutes without cooling the mixture. The reaction mixture warms slightly and is<br>
heated at 80-100°C for 7 hours in an oil bath (temperature in the oil bath) with stir-<br>
ring until the evolution of gas ceases. After cooling to room temperature, the mix-<br>
ture is distilled under atmospheric pressure, giving 17.48 g (yield: 90.5%) of methyl<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonate as a transparent, colourless liquid (boiling range 98-<br>
100°C).<br>
19F- and 1H-NMR data correspond to the literature data and those in the preceding<br>
