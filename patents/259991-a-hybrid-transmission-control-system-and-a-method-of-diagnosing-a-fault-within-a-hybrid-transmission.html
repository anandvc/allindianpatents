FIELD<br>
 The present disclosure relates to transmission state control, and<br>
more particularly to a commanded clutch diagnostic for a hybrid transmission.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
 Traditionally, vehicles include multiple systems that regulate<br>
overall operation of the vehicle. For example, the vehicle includes a power plant<br>
(e.g., an internal combustion engine and/or an electric machine) that generates<br>
drive torque, an energy storage device (e.g., battery pack) that provides electrical<br>
energy, a transmission that distributes the drive torque to drive wheels and<br>
various other systems.<br>
 Each of the systems includes an associated control modules or<br>
modules that communicate with one another to regulate operation of the vehicle.<br>
For example, operation of a hybrid transmission (i.e., a transmission including at<br>
least one electric machine for providing drive torque and regenerative braking) is<br>
regulated using a hybrid control module and a transmission control module. It is<br>
important that each of the control modules is properly functioning to ensure<br>
proper operation of the hybrid transmission.<br><br><br>
 Control module failures (e.g., a software failure, RAM and/or<br>
ROM corruption, and/or an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) failure) can be<br>
protected against by having a secondary path of calculation for a security-critical<br>
variable using a seed and key, or a duplicate path in a separate control module<br>
can be implemented. These security methods have to be specifically designed<br>
for the particular feature which is identified as a security-critical feature.<br>
Furthermore, these security methods increase the complexity, and thus the cost<br>
of the individual control modules.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
 Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of<br>
regulating operation of a hybrid transmission in a vehicle. The method includes<br>
determining a desired transmission state using a first module, generating<br>
transmission control signals based on the desired transmission state using a<br>
second module and receiving at least one transmission parameter signal at the<br>
second module. An actual transmission state is determined based on the at least<br>
one transmission parameter signal at the second module. Whether a fault is<br>
present within the hybrid transmission control system is determined based on the<br>
desired transmission state and the actual transmission state at the first control<br>
module.<br>
In another feature, the desired transmission state is determined<br>
based on a plurality of operating parameters.<br><br><br>
 In another feature, the method further includes signaling a fault<br>
when the desired transmission state is not equivalent to the actual transmission<br>
state.<br>
 In another feature, the method further includes initiating<br>
corrective action when the fault is signaled.<br>
 In still another feature, the method further includes initiating<br>
remedial action when the fault is signaled.<br>
 In yet other features, the at least one transmission parameter<br>
signal corresponds to a parameter of one of a solenoid and an on-off switch of a<br>
hybrid transmission. The parameter includes a position and/or a pressure.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
 The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
 Figure 1 is a functional block diagram of an exemplary hybrid<br>
vehicle system;<br>
 Figure 2 is a functional block diagram of exemplary modules<br>
that regulate operation of the hybrid vehicle system in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure; and<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. For purposes of<br>
clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, activated refers to operation using all of the<br>
engine cylinders. Deactivated refers to operation using less than all of the<br>
cylinders of the engine (one or more cylinders not active). As used herein, the<br>
term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
executes one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle system 10 is<br>
illustrated including an exemplary hybrid transmission 12. The hybrid<br>
transmission 12 is described in further detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,953,409, issued on October 11, 2005 and entitled Two-Mode Compound-<br>
Split Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission Having Four Fixed Ratios, the<br>
disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Although the<br>
hybrid vehicle control of the present disclosure is described with reference to the<br>
hybrid transmission 12, it is appreciated that the hybrid vehicle control can be<br>
implemented with other transmission systems.<br><br><br>
 The vehicle system 10 further includes an engine 14 that<br>
selectively drives the hybrid transmission 12 through a main clutch 16. The<br>
exemplary hybrid transmission 12 is a two-mode, compound-split, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission and includes an input shaft 18 and an output shaft 20.<br>
The hybrid transmission 12 further includes first second and third planetary gear<br>
sets 22, 24, 26, first and second electric machines 28, 30, and first, second, third<br>
and fourth clutches C1, C2, C3, C4. The planetary gear sets 22, 24, 26 each<br>
include a sun gear 22SG, 24SG, 26SG, planetary gears 22PG, 24PG, 26PG, a<br>
planetary carrier 22PC, 24Pc, 26Pc and a ring gear 22RG, 24RG, 26RG. The sun<br>
gears 22SG, 24SG, 26SG, the planetary carriers 22PC, 24PC, 26PC and the ring gears<br>
22RG, 24RG, 26RG of the planetary gear sets 22, 24, 26 are coupled to provide four<br>
fixed gear ratios, as explained in further detail in U.S. 6,953,409. A control<br>
system 40 regulates operation of the engine 14 and the hybrid transmission 12<br>
based on the hybrid vehicle control of the present disclosure.<br>
 The first and second electric machines 28, 30 are each operable<br>
in a generator mode and a motor mode. In the generator mode, the electric<br>
machine 28, 30 absorbs rotational energy, which can be converted into electrical<br>
energy that is stored in an energy storage device (e.g., a battery and/or a super-<br>
capacitor). In the motor mode, the electric machine 28, 30 drives one or more<br>
components of the hybrid transmission 12. More specifically, the first electrical<br>
machine 28 is mechanically coupled with the sun gear 22SG of the first planetary<br>
gear set 22 and the rung gear of the second planetary gear. The second<br>
electrical machine 30 is directly mechanically coupled with the sun gear 24SG of<br><br><br>
the second planetary gear set 24 and the sun gear 26SG of the third planetary<br>
gear set 26.<br>
 The first, second, third and fourth clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 are<br>
implemented to establish various gear ratios. The first clutch C1 functions as a<br>
brake and is selectively engageable to brake rotation of the ring gear 26RG of the<br>
third planetary gear set 26. The second clutch C2 is selectively engageable to fix<br>
the planetary carriers 22pc, 24Pc of the first and second planetary gear sets 22,<br>
24 with the planetary carrier 26PC of the third planetary gear set 26 and the<br>
output shaft 20. The third clutch C3 functions as a brake and is selectively<br>
engageable to brake rotation of the sun gears 24SG, 26SG of the second and third<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26, to brake rotation of the second electric machine 30<br>
and/or to brake rotation of the planetary carrier 24PC of the second planetary gear<br>
set 24, depending on whether the fourth clutch C4 is engaged. The fourth clutch<br>
C4 is selectively engageable to couple the planetary carrier 24PC of the second<br>
planetary gear set 24 with the sun gears 24SG, 26SG of the second and third<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and the second electric machine 30.<br>
 The hybrid transmission 12 is operable to provide first and<br>
second modes (Mode 1, Mode 2) and first, second, third and fourth fixed gear<br>
ratios (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th). More specifically, the clutches C1, C2, C3, C4 and the<br>
electric machines 28, 30 are implemented to establish one of the modes and<br>
gear ratios in accordance with the following table:<br><br><br><br>
wherein G indicates operation in the generator mode, M indicates operation in<br>
the motor mode and X indicates clutch engagement.<br>
 Engagement of the first, second, third and fourth clutches C1,<br>
C2, C3, C4 is regulated by a hydraulic system 42 that distributes pressurized<br>
fluid to the various clutches 16, C1, C2, C3, C4. The hydraulic system 42<br>
includes a plurality of on-off switches (not shown) and a plurality of solenoids 44,<br>
each of which regulates the hydraulic fluid flow to a respective clutch. Each<br>
solenoid 44 is operable between a fully open position and a fully closed position<br>
to regulate hydraulic fluid flow to a respective clutch. In the fully closed position,<br>
no hydraulic fluid is provided to the respective clutch. Accordingly, the fluid<br>
pressure downstream of the solenoid 44 should be at a minimum. In the fully<br>
open position, the maximum amount of hydraulic fluid is provided to the<br>
respective clutch and the fluid pressure downstream of the solenoid 44 should be<br>
at a maximum.<br>
 The control system 40 generates control signals that indicate<br>
which solenoids 44 and/or on-off valves are to be actuated and are<br>
communicated to the hydraulic system 42. A sensor 46 is associated with each<br><br>
solenoid and provides a feedback signal to the control system. Although a single<br>
sensor 46 is illustrated, it is appreciated that there is at least one sensor 46<br>
associated with each solenoid 44. The sensor 46 includes one of a solenoid<br>
position sensor and/or a line pressure sensor. In the case of a solenoid position<br>
sensor, the sensor 46 provides a feedback signal to the control system 40<br>
indicating the actuated position of the solenoid 44. In the case of a line pressure<br>
sensor, the sensor 46 provides a feedback signal to the control system 40<br>
indicating the line pressure downstream of the solenoid 44 (i.e., the fluid pressure<br>
acting on the respective clutch).<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, the control system 40 includes a first<br>
module 50, provided as a hybrid control module (HCM), and a second module<br>
52, provided as a transmission control module (TCM). The first and second<br>
modules 50, 52 communicate via a controller area network (CAN) bus. The first<br>
module 50 receives input signals including, but not limited to, an accelerator<br>
pedal position signal, a brake pedal position signal, a drive range signal (e.g., P,<br>
R, N, D, L) and signal indicating the engine operating parameters. The first<br>
module 50 determines a desired transmission state (TSDES) based on the input<br>
signals.<br>
 TSDES and a corresponding timestamp are saved into a memory<br>
of the first module 50 and are communicated to the second module 52 via the<br>
CAN bus, which determines the control signals for actuating the solenoids to<br>
achieve TSDES. For example, if TSDES is 3rd gear, the second module 52<br>
generates control signals to actuate the solenoids 44 corresponding to C2 and<br><br><br>
C4. After the solenoids 44 are actuated, feedback signals from the sensors 46<br>
are received by the second module 52. The second module 52 determines an<br>
actual transmission state (TSACT) based on the feedback signals. More<br>
specifically, each of the sensors 46 provides a feedback signal to the second<br>
module 52 indicating one of a solenoid position and a line pressure. Each<br>
solenoid position or line pressure signal indicates whether the respective clutch is<br>
engaged. In this manner, the second module 52 can determine which clutches<br>
are engaged and determines TSACT based thereon.<br>
£9027] TSACT and a corresponding timestamp are communicated to the<br>
first module 50, which compares TSDES and TSACT- More specifically, the first<br>
module 50 retrieves TSDES from memory based on the timestamps. In this<br>
manner, TSACT is compared with the proper TSDES- If TSDES and TSACT are<br>
equivalent, the first and second modules 50, 52 are deemed to be operating<br>
properly. If TSDES and TSACT are not equivalent, a fault is signaled indicating a<br>
problem with at least one of the first and second modules 50, 52.<br>
 The fault can result from one of a plurality of failure modes. The<br>
failure modes can include, but are not limited to, a stuck CAN message, a<br>
corrupted TSDES (i.e., a fault with the first module (HCM)) and/or a corrupted<br>
TSEST (i.e., a fault with the second module (TCM)). Although the fault could be<br>
the result of solenoid and/or on-off switch component failures, such component<br>
failures are diagnosed using a parallel diagnostic routine (e.g. layer 1 security).<br>
 A plurality of corrective actions can be implemented, each of<br>
which corresponds to a particular failure mode. Exemplary corrective actions<br><br><br>
include, but are not limited to, using the last known good value or temporarily<br>
forcing neutral or a constant gear ratio in the case of a stuck CAN message and<br>
corrupted desired, and/or resetting the control module in the case of a so-called<br>
"evil" control module. If the corrective actions do not resolve the fault, remedial<br>
action can be implemented. The remedial action can include, but is not limited<br>
to, limiting the drivability of the vehicle. For example, operation of the hybrid<br>
transmission 12 can be restricted to one of the first and second modes.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 3, exemplary steps that are executed by<br>
the hybrid vehicle control of the present disclosure will be described in detail. In<br>
step 300, control determines TSDES in the first module 50. In step 302, control<br>
sends TSDES to the second module 52 over the CAN bus. Control regulates the<br>
hybrid transmission 12 in step 304 based on the control signals generated by the<br>
second module 52, which are based on TSDES- In step 306, control monitors the<br>
transmission parameters at the second module 52. Control estimates TSACT<br>
within the second module 52 in step 308 based on the transmission parameters.<br>
In step 310, TSACT is sent to the first module 50 via the CAN bus.<br>
 In step 312, control determines whether TSACT is equal to TSDES-<br>
If TSACT is equal to TSDES, control ends. If TSACT is not equal to TSDES, control<br>
initiates corrective action in step 314. In step 316, control determines whether<br>
the fault is resolved. If the fault is resolved, control ends. If the fault is not<br>
resolved, control sets an error code in step 318, initiates remedial action and<br>
control ends.<br><br><br>
 The present disclosure provides a system and method that<br>
ensures secure transmission commands that correspond to a desired<br>
transmission state without requiring a parallel path with a seed and key in either<br>
of the control modules and without requiring a duplicate path in a separate<br>
control module. In this manner, a secure transmission state is provided without<br>
complex and costly control modules. Eliminating the seed and key and parallel<br>
paths should result in less commuter resource utilization in the form of ROM,<br>
RAM and throughput. CAN communication resources may also be reduced.<br>
 Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be implemented<br>
in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been described in<br>
connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the invention<br>
should not be so limited since other modifications will become apparent to the<br>
skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification and the<br>
