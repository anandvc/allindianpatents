Sliding Gate Valve for a Container containing Molten Metal<br>
The   invention   relates   to   a   sliding   gate   valve and to an associated slider unit.<br>
In a known sliding gate valve disclosed in the publication EP-A-0277146, a longitudinally slidable slider unit is provided which accommodates a refractory valve plate and is constructed as a sliding carriage and has rollers on both sides for its longitudinal guidance. In the installed state, the sliding carriage is longitudinally guided with its rollers on guide tracks on a frame which, for its part, is vertically movably mounted on a housing upper portion by means of a plurality of spring elements. The housing upper portion for its part is releasably secured to the outlet of the vessel containing the molten metal.<br>
The slider unit can be released from the frame and from the housing upper portion, particularly for plate replacement, by virtue of the fact that it is movable into a position situated outside an open and closed position in which the guide tracks are lowered through a height which relaxes the spring elements. The frame provided with the guide tracks is massive as a result of its construction similar to a housing and it is thus of relatively complex construction and consequently expensive to manufacture.<br>
Against this background, it is the object of the present invention to provide a sliding gate valve of the type referred to above which is of simple construction and may thus be manufactured more economically.<br><br>
2<br>
The object is solved in accordance with the particularly invention<br>
This sliding gate valve in accordance with the invention can be provided with smaller dimensions, particularly as regards its length and breadth, by comparison with the known valve described above with the same stroke and the same plate sizes. Furthermore, it may be manufactured more economically by virtue of the fact that the housing frame can be omitted.<br>
The advantages of the known sliding gate valve, such as, for example, the automatic release and clamping of the slider unit from and to the housing portion, are, however, made full use of with this sliding gate valve in accordance with the invention.<br>
A further substantial advantage with this sliding gate valve in accordance with the invention resides in the fact that, after release from the housing portion, the slider unit is pivotally mounted with a simply constructed hinge about an axis of rotation extending parallel to the direction of movement which is provided on one or other outer side of the housing portion. The slider unit can thus be swung in a horizontal and non-vertical direction in the many installation conditions of the ladles which prevail.<br>
Exemplary embodiments and further advantages of the invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a sliding gate valve in accordance with the invention,<br><br>
3<br>
Fig. 2 is an underneath view of the sliding gate valve of Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 is a side view of the sliding gate valve of Fig. 1, its slider unit being shown in chain-dotted lines,<br>
Fig. 4 is a longitudinal sectional view of the sliding gate valve of Fig. 1, and<br>
Fig. 5 is a sectional view of a modified construction of the sliding gate valve.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a sliding gate valve 20 at the outlet of a container containing molten metal. Of this container, which is lined with refractory material, only the outer steel shell 13 and a refractory nozzle brick 17 are shown. This container is, in particular, a ladle used in a continuous casting installation into which molten metal is introduced. A refractory sleeve 11 defines the outlet opening 12 of the container, closely adjoining which is an upper, refractory valve plate 22 which is secured in a housing portion 14 of the sliding gate valve 20. A refractory valve plate 23, which is mounted in a longitudinally movable slider unit 30, is pressed against the upper plate 22 by means of spring elements 26. Adjoining the latter is a replaceable refractory outlet sleeve 16. This plate 23 serves to open and close the valve 20, for which purpose it is arranged to be slidable by a drive element together with the slider unit 30 holding it.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the slider unit 30 is mounted longitudinally movably on the housing portion 14 by a plurality of mounting means 40 extending perpendicular to its longitudinal extent, these mounting means 40 being secured to the housing portion 14 and having oppositely a guide means<br><br>
4<br>
which slides on a respective guide track formed on the slider unit 30.<br>
Two mounting means 40 are conveniently provided on both sides of the valve plate 22, 23 which are arranged symmetrically with respect to the outlet opening 12 of the container and each have a peg-shaped connecting element 25 extending perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of the housing portion 14 and of the slider unit 30. These connecting elements 25 are mounted in the housing portion 14 so as to be movable in their axial direction and acting on their upper head plates 25' there is a respective spring element 26 constructed as a compression spring, the latter being encapsulated in a sleeve 28. Rotatably mounted on the lower end of the connecting elements 25 in pairs are two respective slide rollers 27, provided as guide means, on which the slider unit 30 is longitudinally guided. For this purpose, the latter has, on both sides of the valve plate 23 insertable into it, a respective T groove-shaped recess 33 extending in its direction of movement in which two respective guide tracks 36 are formed. This symmetrical arrangement of the pairs of slide rollers with respect to the line of action of the spring force produced by the spring element 26 renders possible an optimal force transfer from the mounting means 40 to the slider unit 30 and subsequently to the plates 22, 23, which are to be pressed against one another.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the T groove-shaped recesses 33, shown laterally in the slider unit 30 as hidden detail, are each provided in the centre and at the end with diverging openings 33' which are so constructed and dimensioned with respect to one another that the connecting elements 25 are slidable into them together with the slide rollers 27 and can be removed from them.<br><br>
5<br>
Fig. 3 shows the guide tracks 36 which have a respective ramp 36' at the end by the openings 33' of such a height that the spring elements 26 are stressed to the operating pressure when they run onto them and are completely relaxed when released. For the purpose of release, the slider unit 30 is moved into a position situated outside the open and the closed positions of the valve 20 in which the slider unit is relieved of the spring pressure until its openings 33' are situated above the slide rollers 27 and it is then released. Hinge members 37 disposed laterally on the slider unit 30 move with their bores into corresponding hinge pegs 38 on the housing portion 14, whereby the slider unit 30 can be swung outwardly. It is coupled by means of claws 41 or the like to a push rod 42 of a drive element 19 constructed in the form of a hydraulic cylinder. As a further advantage, this claw coupling enables the slider unit 30 to be automatically released from the push rod 42.<br>
The hinge 37, 38 could also be arranged on the other side of the slider unit 30 or on the shorter side remote from the drive. Accordingly, the slider unit can be swung out on one of the three sides, depending on the positioning of the valve on the ladle outlet. Since the direction of movement of the slider unit at the installation location extends in the vertical direction in many applications, the slider unit can be swung horizontally in the illustrated arrangement, which is associated with a small application of force.<br>
The two mounting means 40 located on one side of the valve plate 22, 23 are reinforced by at least one connecting rod 31, 32 for stabilisation against the bending forces which occur and they thus constitute a carriage shape. The two connecting rods 31, 32 provided in the present case are situated centrally in the recess 33.  They have a breadth which corresponds approximately to that of the<br><br>
6<br>
connecting elements 25 so that the same can be introduced into or removed from the recess 33. The connecting elements 25 are also divided into two and connected together by a tongue and groove connection 25" or the like. These connecting rods 31, 32 could also in principle be omitted. Sliding blocks could also be used instead of the slide rollers 27.<br>
As a further advantage, these mounting means 40 can be removed laterally from the housing portion 14 as a unit, within the scope of the invention, when the slider unit 30 is swung out. For this purpose, appropriate openings 15 are present in the housing portion 14 into which the mounting means can be fittingly slid. The spring elements 26 can be rapidly removed out of them for the frequently necessary tests of their biasing force and reinserted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, transverse and longitudinal ribs 30' are associated with the slider unit 30 in its central part which serves to reinforce the same against distortion and torsional forces. The sliding gate valve 20 is otherwise illustrated in the closed position.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a modified sliding gate valve 50 which is basically constructed in a manner similar to that of Fig. 1. Only the differences will therefore be discussed below in more detail. This sliding gate valve 50 again has a housing portion 54 which is secured to the container and in which a stationary, refractory valve plate 22 is contained. A significant difference to the valve 20 is that the mounting means 65 are not secured in the housing portion 54 but to the slider unit 60. The axially movable connecting elements 55 are mounted together with the spring elements 66, constituted by a plurality of plate springs, in a recess 61 in the slider unit 60.   Associated with the connecting elements 55, of which<br><br>
7<br>
there are advantageously again four, as guide means there is a respective slide roller 68, which is rotatable on a horizontal shaft 69 and slides on a guide track 71 on the housing portion 54 constructed in a manner analogous to that in Fig. 3. The two guide tracks 71 provided laterally on the housing portion extend in the direction of movement of the slider unit and are provided with ramps, which are not shown in detail and serve to load and unload the spring elements 66.<br>
In the sliding gate valves 20, 50 in accordance with the invention discussed above, both the housing portion 14, 54 and the slider unit 30, 60 have a construction similar to a plate and in the operational condition are arranged parallel and at a small spacing from one another. These sliding gate valves 20, 50 can thus be maintained dimensionally as small as possible as a result of this construction in accordance with the invention, as regards the constructional height and also its length and breadth. The result of this is more economical manufacture of the same. This valve can be produced both in smaller dimensions for smaller ladles of up to 100 tons holding capacity and also in larger dimensions for 300 ton ladles.<br>
In principle, the necessary spring packet for urging the refractory plates against one another could be provided in a manner known per se between the sliding plate and the slider unit. The mounting means could accordingly be arranged non-movably in the housing portion or in the slider unit.<br><br>
