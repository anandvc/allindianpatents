CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG do hereby verify that the content of English translated complete specification filed in pursuance of PCT International application No. PCT/EP2006/008720 thereof is correct and complete.<br><br><br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a thread connecting device according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Thread connecting devices, for example for the pneumatic splicing of two thread ends, in particular in conjunction with automatic cross-winding machines, have been known for a long time and are described in detail in numerous patent applications in various embodiments. It is described in this case in many of these patent applications that it is expedient if the thread ends to be connected are prepared before the actual splicing process, in other words, are at least partially freed of their yarn twist. The preparation of the thread ends for the splicing process may, in this case, take place either pneumatically by means of so-called thread end opening tubes, or mechanically, for example by means of counter-rotating friction discs.<br>
DE 44 20 979 Al describes a thread splicing device, in which thread end opening tubes are arranged spaced apart from a splicing channel arranged in a splicing prism, into which thread end opening tubes the thread ends to be spliced are sucked before the actual splicing process and are pneumatically freed from their yarn twist by blowing in an air flow which is directed against the yarn twist of the thread ends.<br>
Thread splicing devices, in which the preparation of the thread ends takes place by means of two friction discs driven to counter-rotate are known, for example from DE 30 29 452 C2. In these thread splicing devices, a splicing prism is also positioned between the friction discs and pneumatically connects the thread ends mechanically prepared by the friction discs.<br>
A similar thread splicing device is also described in EP 1 302 428 Al. In this known thread splicing device, the pneumatically loadable splicing prism in the region of its splicing channel, in addition to the conventional splicing air bores, also has additional bores which can be subjected to a reduced pressure and are used to fix the thread ends in the splicing channel. In the thread splicing device according to EP 1<br><br><br>
302 428 Al, the preparation of the thread ends may optionally take place either pneumatically by means of thread end opening tubes or mechanically by two friction discs driven to counter-rotate.<br>
However, there are no indications either in DE 30 29 452 C2 or in EP1 302 428 Al as to how the friction discs are fixed in the thread splicing device. In other words, it is not described anywhere whether the friction discs, which are parts subject to wear, are fixed components of the thread splicing device or whether the friction discs are integrated so as to be exchangeable in the thread splicing device.<br>
Furthermore, thread connecting devices are described in EP 0 140 412 Bl, in which the thread ends are acted upon by two friction discs which can be driven to counter-rotate in such a way that the thread ends are twisted together. The friction discs of these known thread connecting devices are mounted so as to be both rotatable and also movable to tilt to a limited extent in receiving elements of the thread connecting mechanism. In other words, the friction discs are in each case supported by means of a large number of helical springs on an associated rotary part, which is in turn arranged in each case in a bearing housing of the thread connecting device. As the friction discs are hardly accessible, the relevant thread connecting device firstly has to be dismantled from the automatic cross-winding machine to exchange the friction discs and then has to be partially disassembled. This means that in these known thread connecting devices, exchanging the friction discs is relatively laborious and complicated and always requires using specially trained technical staff.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of providing a thread connecting device equipped with friction discs, the friction discs of which can be exchanged without problems if necessary.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a thread connecting device as described in claim 1.<br><br><br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
The configuration according to the invention of a thread connecting device with friction discs, which are attached to receiving rings of the thread connecting device so as to be easily accessible and so that it is possible to install and dismantle them without tools in such a way that an exchange of the friction discs, which, as is known, are subject to wear, is possible at any time without the thread connecting device having to be dismantled from the textile machine beforehand, in particular has the advantage that to install and dismantle these parts subject to wear, neither technical knowledge nor a special tool is required. This means that worn friction discs can be removed without problems in the shortest time by the regular operating staff of the textile machine and can be replaced at any time by new friction discs.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the friction discs are non-positively fixed, in this case, to the receiving rings by permanent magnet inserts (claim 2). The permanent magnet inserts correspond here to bearing rings of the friction discs which are manufactured from a ferromagnetic material, for example steel.<br>
As described in claim 3, it is provided in an advantageous manner that each of the receiving rings has at least one friction disc entrainer corresponding with a recess on a bearing ring of the friction discs and at least one permanent magnet insert fixed in the bore of the receiving ring. Receiving rings configured in this manner, which are in turn arranged in the thread splicing device so as to be movable in a rotating manner, ensure that the friction discs can be secured so as to be positively and magnetically reliably fixed.<br>
The positive connection in this case ensures reliable transmission of the torques introduced via the receiving rings onto the friction discs, while the magnetic connection ensures that the friction discs are reliably fixed, on the one hand, during operation but, if necessary, can nevertheless easily be removed from their installation position.<br><br><br>
As shown in claim 4, it is provided in a preferred embodiment that each of the receiving rings has two diametrically arranged friction disc entrainers and in that two likewise diametrically arranged bores for receiving permanent magnet inserts are let into each of the receiving rings.<br>
In conjunction with correspondingly arranged recesses on the bearing ring of the friction disc, which is produced from a ferromagnetic material, an arrangement of this type ensures that during operation not only is a uniform distribution of the forces achieved during the introduction of torque, but a uniform fixing of the friction discs on the receiving ring is also ensured.<br>
According to claim 5, the friction disc has a bearing ring produced from a ferromagnetic material and a friction covering which is preferably produced from a plastics material and can be non-detachably fixed on the bearing ring. The bearing ring made of a ferromagnetic material, preferably from steel, in this case allows, in a simple manner, a secure, but nevertheless, if necessary, easily detachable fixing of the friction discs on the receiving rings, while the plastics material of the friction covering ensures that the thread ends can be reliably freed of their yarn twist by the counter-rotating friction discs.<br>
In other words, the plastics material of the friction coverings is configured such that the thread ends are entrained during the rotation of the friction discs and are rolled about their longitudinal axis. In this manner, the thread ends, depending on the direction of rotation, can either be untwisted or provided with a new thread twist.<br>
As shown in claims 6 and 7, the friction covering in the bearing ring is either fixed by an adhesive connection or fastened by vulcanisation. The two types of fastening ensure a secure, durable connection between the friction covering and bearing ring.<br>
The invention will be described below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br><br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a workstation of an automatic cross-winding machine with a thread splicing device configured according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the thread splicing device according to Fig. 1 schematically in a perspective view,<br>
Fig. 3 shows an exploded drawing of the thread splicing device according to Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a friction disc with the associated receiving ring,<br>
Fig. 5 shows the friction disc and the receiving ring in the assembled state.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a front view of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins characterised as a whole with the reference numeral 1, in the embodiment an automatic cross-winding machine. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type usually have, between their end frames (not shown), a large number of similar workstations 2, on which, as known and therefore not explained in more detail, spinning cops 9, which have been produced, for example, on a ring spinning machine, are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15. After their production, these cross-wound bobbins 15 are transferred to a cross-wound bobbin transporting mechanism 21 along the length of the machine by means of an automatically operating service unit, preferably a cross-wound bobbin changer (not shown) and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine.<br>
Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type usually also have a logistics mechanism in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 3, in which, spinning cops 9, or empty tubes, circulate on transport plates 8 in a vertical orientation. Of this bobbin and tube transporting system 3, only the bobbin supply section 4, the reversibly drivable storage section 5, a transverse transporting section 6 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 7 are shown in Fig. 1.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type generally have a central control unit (not shown), which is connected by means of a machine bus both to the workstation computers 29 of the individual winding heads 2 and also to a control mechanism of the service unit.<br>
As already indicated above, the delivered spinning cops 9 are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 15 in the unwinding positions AS, which are located in each case in the region of the transverse transporting sections 6 at the winding heads 2.<br>
The individual winding stations have, for this purpose, as known and therefore only indicated, various mechanisms, which ensure proper operation of these workstations. These mechanisms are, for example, a suction nozzle 12 which can be rotated to a limited extent about a pivot pin 13 for handling an upper thread 31, a gripper tube 25 which can be rotated about a pivot pin 20 for handling a lower thread 32 and a thread connecting mechanism 10.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 1, the thread connecting mechanism configured as a pneumatic thread splicing device 10 is slightly set back with respect to the regular thread run and has, as indicated, for example in Fig. 3, a centrally arranged, axially displaceably mounted, pneumatically loadable splicing prism 11 for connecting two thread ends 31,32 as well as friction discs 16,17 for machining of the thread ends 31,32.<br>
Workstations 2 of this type generally also have further mechanisms, not shown in more detail, such as a thread tensioner, a thread clearer, a waxing device, a thread cutting mechanism, a thread tensile force sensor and a lower thread sensor.<br>
The winding of the cross-wound bobbins 15 takes place on winding devices 24. The winding devices 24 of this type inter alia have a creel 28 which is movably mounted about a pivot pin 22 and a mechanism for rotatably holding a cross-wound bobbin tube.    During the winding process, the cross-wound bobbin 15 freely rotatably<br><br><br>
mounted in the creel 28 rests with its surface on a bobbin winding drum 14 and is entrained thereby by frictional engagement.<br>
The thread splicing device 10 according to the invention is shown in more detail in Figs 2 and 3. Fig. 2 in this case shows the thread splicing device 10 in a perspective view from the front, while Fig. 3 shows the thread splicing device 10 in the form of an exploded drawing.<br>
As indicated in Fig. 3, receiving rings 19 which can be rotatably driven by drives, not shown, are arranged inside the housing 36 of the thread splicing device 10, which receiving rings are equipped with friction disc entrainers 23 and bores 27 to receive permanent magnet inserts 26. Friction discs 16 or 17 are arranged so as to be easily accessible and easily exchangeable in or on the receiving rings 19, as also explained in more detail below with the aid of Figs 4 and 5. An axially displaceable, pneumatically loadable splicing prism 11 with a splicing channel 35 is also mounted in the central region of the annularly configured friction discs 16,17.<br>
As shown in Figs 4 and 5, each receiving ring 19 preferably has two diametrically arranged friction disc entrainers 23 A, 23B and two also diametrically arranged bores 27. Permanent magnet inserts 26A, 26B which correspond with the bearing rings 30 of the friction discs 16,17 are fixed in each case in the bores 27. The bearing rings 30 of the friction discs 16, 17 are produced for this reason from a ferromagnetic material, preferably from steel, and have recesses 34A, 34B, over which, as shown for example in Fig. 5, the friction disc entrainers 23A, 23B of the receiving ring 19 engage in the assembled state. A friction covering 33, which is preferably produced from a plastics material, is non-detachably fixed, for example by means of vulcanisation or adhesion, in each case in the bearing rings 30. The material of the friction coverings 33 is preferably selected here such that when the friction discs 16, 17 rest on the thread ends 31, 32, depending on the direction of rotation of the friction discs 16,17, the thread ends 31, 32 can either be untwisted or a new twist can be provided on the thread ends 31,32.<br><br><br>
Functioning of the mechanism:<br>
If the operating staff of the textile machine establish, for example, that the splicing connections at a workstation 2 no longer correspond with the quality demands required, this may, for example, be due to insufficient preparation of the thread ends. In other words, the friction discs 16,17 of the thread connecting device 10 of the relevant workstation 2 may, for example, be worn or soiled and should therefore be exchanged or cleared.<br>
To exchange the friction discs 16,17, the easily accessible bearing rings 30 with the friction coverings 33 merely have to be lifted from the receiving rings 19 against the magnetic force of the permanent magnet inserts 26A, 26B and replaced by new friction discs 16,17, which can be correspondingly simply placed from the front onto the receiving rings 19.<br>
The exchange of the friction discs takes place without problems and rapidly with the thread connecting device 10 installed. The operating staff do not need any special tool or particular technical knowledge to exchange the friction discs 16,17.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment shown. Further embodiment variants are conceivable both with respect to the configuration of the receiving rings 19 and also with regard to the configuration of the friction discs 16,17 without thus departing from the general idea of the invention. The friction discs do not, for example, absolutely have to have a bearing ring in which a friction covering made from plastics material is fixed, but the friction disc may also directly consist of one or more plastics materials, into which a steel insert is let.<br>
Various further variants are also possible with regard to the type of fixing of the friction discs 16,17 on receiving rings 19 of the thread connecting device 10. It is, for example, not absolutely necessary for the friction discs 16, 17 to be magnetically fixed to the receiving rings 19 of the thread connecting device 10.<br><br><br>
Instead of a magnetic connection, a clip connection may also be provided, for example.<br>
In such a case, the clips, which are preferably arranged on the receiving rings, engage over the friction discs positioned in the working position or the bearing ring thereof.<br>
Furthermore, the friction discs could also be fastened by spring rings on the receiving rings of the thread connecting device. The spring rings in this case merely have to be configured such that they can be adjusted by hand.<br>
A further possibility of fixing the friction discs so as to be easily accessible and exchangeable without tools to the receiving rings of the thread connecting device is provided by the use of a so-called carbine lock. Such carbine locks, as is known, can be manually opened and closed without problems.<br>
Finally, the contour of the bearing ring of the friction discs and the shape of the receiving ring may be directly matched to one another in such a way that they fit in one another and, for example, can be positively fixed by rotation.<br>
It is essential in the sense of the general idea of the invention only that the friction discs are attached to receiving rings of the thread connecting device so as to be easily accessible and exchangeable without tools in such a way that an exchange of the friction discs is also possible when the thread connecting device is installed even for staff who do not have special technical knowledge.<br><br><br>
