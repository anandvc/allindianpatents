				<td>Process for the regeneration of a Fischer Tropsch catalyst<br>
Natural gas, found in deposits in the earth, is an abundant<br>
energy resource. For example, natural gas commonly serves<br>
as a fuel for heating, cooking, and power generation, among<br>
other things. The process of obtaining natural gas from an<br>
earth formation typically includes drilling a well into the<br>
formation. Wells that provide natural gas are often remote<br>
from locations with a demand for the consumption of the<br>
natural gas.<br>
Thus, natural gas is conventionally transported large<br>
distances from the wellhead to commercial destinations in<br>
pipelines. This transportation presents technological<br>
challenges due in part to the large volume occupied by a<br>
gas. Because the volume of an amount of gas is so much<br>
greater than the volume of the same number of gas molecules<br>
in a liquefied state, the process of transporting natural<br>
gas typically includes chilling and/or pressurizing the<br>
natural gas in order to liquefy it. However, this<br>
contributes to the final cost of the natural gas and is not<br>
economical.<br>
Formations that include small amounts of natural gas may<br>
include primarily oil, with the natural gas being a<br>
byproduct of oil production that is thus termed associated<br>
gas. In the past, associated gas has typically been flared,<br>
i.e., burned in the ambient air. However, current<br>
environmental concerns and regulations discourage or<br>
prohibit this practice.<br>
Further, naturally occurring sources of crude oil used for<br>
liquid fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and<br>
diesel fuel have been decreasing and supplies are not<br>
expected to meet demand in the coming years. Fuels that are<br>
liquid under standard atmospheric conditions have the<br><br>
advantage that in addition to their value, they can be<br>
transported more easily in a pipeline than natural gas,<br>
since they do not require liquefaction.<br>
Thus, for all of the above-described reasons, there has<br>
been interest in developing technologies for converting<br>
natural gas to more readily transportable liquid fuels,<br>
i.e. to fuels that are liquid at standard temperatures and<br>
pressures.<br>
The above is also known as GTL (gas to liquid), i.e. the<br>
conversion of natural gas into other, heavier hydrocarbons.<br>
Instead of using gas, also coal or biomass can be used as<br>
the feed stock for making synthesis gas. For the coal<br>
feedstock, the process is known as CTL, when based on<br>
biomass the abbreviation BTL is commonly used. The general<br>
principle is to convert the feedstock into synthesis gas<br>
which is then converted into the desired hydrocarbons. The<br>
term XTL is also sometimes used to describe the general<br>
process, X stands in this case for any feedstock that can<br>
be converted into synthesis gas.<br>
One method for converting natural gas, coal and/or biomass<br>
to liquid fuels involves two sequential chemical<br>
transformations. In case of GTL, the first transformation,<br>
natural gas or methane, the major chemical component of<br>
natural gas, is reacted with oxygen and/or steam to form<br>
syngas, which is a combination of predominantly carbon<br>
monoxide gas and hydrogen gas. Syngas (or synthesis gas)<br>
can also contain carbon dioxide. In case of CTL, coal is<br>
gasified to syngas. In case of BTL, biomass is gasified to<br>
syngas. The production of syngas itself can normally<br>
includes multiple steps. After making the CO/H2 containing<br>
gas mixture, the syngas often needs to be purified to<br>
remove certain substances that would cause problems<br>
downstream in the Fischer-Tropsch section. After the syngas<br>
has been optionally purified, the second transformation,<br>
known as the Fischer-Tropsch process takes place. The<br><br>
predominant reaction is between carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen to form organic molecules containing carbon and<br>
hydrogen. Those molecules containing only carbon and<br>
hydrogen are known as hydrocarbons. Those molecules<br>
containing oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen are<br>
known as oxygenates. Hydrocarbons having carbons linked in<br>
a straight chain are known as aliphatics and are<br>
particularly desirable as the basis of synthetic diesel<br>
fuel.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch process is commonly facilitated by a<br>
catalyst. Catalysts desirably have the function of<br>
increasing the rate of a reaction without being consumed by<br>
the reaction. Common catalysts for use in the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch process contain at least one metal from Groups 8,<br>
9, or 10 of the Periodic Table (in the new IUPAC notation,<br>
which is used throughout the present specification). The<br>
molecules react to form hydrocarbons while confined on the<br>
surface of the catalyst. The hydrocarbon products then<br>
desorb from the catalyst and can be collected. H. Schulz<br>
(Applied Catalysis A: General 1999, 186, p 3) gives an<br>
overview of trends in Fischer-Tropsch catalysis.<br>
The catalyst may be contacted with synthesis gas in a<br>
variety of reaction zones that may include one or more<br>
reactors. Common reactors include packed bed (also termed<br>
fixed bed) reactors, slurry bed reactors, and fluidized bed<br>
reactors. Originally, the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis was<br>
carried out in packed bed reactors. These reactors have<br>
several drawbacks, such as poor temperature control, that<br>
can be overcome by gas-agitated slurry reactors or slurry<br>
bubble column reactors. Gas-agitated multiphase reactors<br>
sometimes called "slurry reactors" or "slurry bubble<br>
columns," operate by suspending catalytic particles in<br>
liquid and feeding gas reactants into the bottom of the<br>
reactor through a gas distributor, which produces small gas<br>
bubbles. As the gas bubbles rise through the reactor, the<br><br>
reactants are absorbed into the liquid and diffuse to the<br>
catalyst where, depending on the catalyst system, they are<br>
typically converted to gaseous and liquid products. The<br>
gaseous products formed enter the gas bubbles and are<br>
collected at the top of the reactor. Liquid products are<br>
recovered from the suspending liquid by using different<br>
techniques like filtration, settling, hydrocyclones,<br>
magnetic techniques, etc. Gas-agitated multiphase reactors<br>
or slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) inherently have<br>
very high heat transfer rates; therefore, reduced reactor<br>
cost and the ability to remove and add catalyst online are<br>
principal advantages of such reactors in Fischer-Tropsch<br>
synthesis, which is exothermic. Sie and Krishna (Applied<br>
Catalysis A: General 1999, 186, p. 55) give a history of<br>
the development of various Fischer Tropsch reactors.<br>
Typically the Fischer-Tropsch product stream contains<br>
hydrocarbons having a range of numbers of carbon atoms, and<br>
thus having a range of molecular weights. Thus, the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch products produced by conversion of<br>
synthesis gas commonly contains a range of hydrocarbons<br>
including gases, liquids and waxes. It is highly desirable<br>
to maximize the production of high-value liquid<br>
hydrocarbons, such as hydrocarbons with at least 5 carbon<br>
atoms per hydrocarbon chain (C.sub.5+ hydrocarbons).<br>
The composition of a catalyst influences the relative<br>
amounts of hydrocarbons obtained from a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalytic process. Cobalt metal is particularly desirable<br>
in catalysts used in converting synthesis gas to<br>
hydrocarbons suitable for the production of diesel fuel.<br>
Further, iron, nickel, and ruthenium have been used in<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Nickel catalysts favor<br>
termination of the chain growth and are useful for aiding<br>
the selective production of methane from syngas. Iron has<br>
the advantage of being readily available and relatively<br>
inexpensive but the disadvantage of a water-gas shift<br><br>
activity. Ruthenium has the advantage of high activity but<br>
is quite expensive.<br>
One of the limitations of a Fischer-Tropsch process is that<br>
the activity of the catalyst will, due to a number of<br>
factors, deteriorate over time.<br>
The commercial incentives for a process to convert<br>
synthesis gas to liquid fuels and other products are<br>
increasing as the need for energy sources increases. One<br>
successful approach to meeting this need has been to make<br>
synthesis gas and then synthetically convert the synthesis<br>
gas into heavier hydrocarbons (C5+) through the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch (F-T) process. The synthetic production of<br>
hydrocarbons by the catalytic reaction of synthesis gas is<br>
well known and is generally referred to as the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reaction. This F-T process was developed<br>
approximately eighty years ago in Germany, and since then,<br>
it has been practiced commercially in Germany during World<br>
War II and later in South Africa. In recent times, very<br>
large, new GTL and CTL complexes are built in other<br>
countries as well.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbon conversion systems typically<br>
have a synthesis gas generator and a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reactor unit. In the case of starting with a gas feed<br>
stock, the synthesis gas generator receives light, short-<br>
chain hydrocarbons such as methane and produces synthesis<br>
gas. The synthesis gas is then delivered to a Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor. In the F-T reactor, the synthesis gas is<br>
primarily converted to useful C5+ hydrocarbons. Recent<br>
examples of Fischer-Tropsch systems are included in U.S.<br>
Pat. Nos. 4,973,453; 5,733,941; and 5,861,441.<br>
Numerous types of reactor systems have been used for<br>
carrying out the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. See generally<br>
the many examples found on www.fischertropsch.org. The<br>
commercial development of the Fischer-Tropsch reactor<br><br>
systems has included conventional fixed-bed and three-phase<br>
slurry bubble column designs or other moving-bed designs.<br>
But, due to the complicated interplay between heat and mass<br>
transfer and the relatively high cost of Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalysts, no single reactor design has dominated the<br>
commercial developments to date.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch three-phase bubble column reactors or the<br>
like appear to offer distinct advantages over the fixed-bed<br>
design in terms of heat transfer and diffusion<br>
characteristics. One particular type of three-phase bubble<br>
column is the slurry bubble column, wherein the catalyst<br>
size is generally between 10 and 200 microns (urn). Three-<br>
phase bubble column reactors present a number of technical<br>
challenges.<br>
The technical challenges associated with three-phase bubble<br>
columns include solids management. One particular challenge<br>
in this area is to efficiently rejuvenate slurry catalysts.<br>
When a slurry Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is used over time,<br>
it has a disadvantage of slowly, but reversibly,<br>
deactivating compared to its initial catalytic activity. As<br>
the synthesis gas (primarily H2 and CO) is fed to the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactor and converted with the F-T<br>
catalyst, the catalyst experiences deactivation caused by<br>
carbon build up, physical degradation, and the effects of<br>
trace compounds other than CO and H2, such as by nitrogen<br>
containing species or oxygenated byproducts. "Carbon build<br>
up" references the accumulation of heavy hydrocarbons and<br>
carbonaceous type material that can have a hydrogen content<br>
less than that of F-T products. To remedy the deactivation,<br>
the catalyst is regenerated, or rejuvenated, using any of a<br>
number of techniques.<br>
Rejuvenation is different from the initial activation of<br>
the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. For cobalt catalysts, the<br>
initial activation involves converting the cobalt to a<br>
reduced state. An example of an initial activation<br><br>
technique is found U.S. Pat. No. 4,729,981, entitled "ROR-<br>
Activated Catalyst for Synthesis Gas Conversion," which<br>
describes the initial preparation of a cobalt or nickel<br>
based Fischer-Tropsch catalyst by reducing it in hydrogen,<br>
oxidizing it in an oxygen-containing gas, and then reducing<br>
it in hydrogen. The catalyst is then ready for its initial<br>
use. Once in use, it will begin to deactivate, and it will<br>
need regeneration.<br>
Regeneration of a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst after activation<br>
and operation has long been known to restore the activity<br>
of the catalyst. See, e.g., H. H. Storch et al., The<br>
Fischer-Tropsch And Related Synthesis (Wiley: New York<br>
1951), 211 222. Storch describes using hydrogen treatments<br>
to restore the catalyst activity. There are many other<br>
examples. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,159,140 describes<br>
pulling the catalyst from the reactor (where it appears to<br>
have been fluidized) and removing the catalyst and treating<br>
it with hydrogen to regenerate the catalyst. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
2,238,726 indicates that the non-volatile reaction products<br>
can be removed from the catalyst by treating it with<br>
hydrogen or gases or vapors containing hydrogen and that<br>
this can be done in the midst of oil circulation. Col. 2:34<br>
54. As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,616,911 describes<br>
oxidizing the catalyst and then reducing it while<br>
maintaining it in suspension or a fluidized state. Other<br>
examples relating to regenerating and/or de-waxing Fischer-<br>
Tropsch catalysts include U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,323,248 Bl;<br>
6,201,030 Bl; 5,844,005; 5,292,705; 2,247,087; 2,259,961;<br>
2,289,731; 2,458,870; 2,518,337; and 2,440,109.<br>
Regenerating a slurry catalyst presents particular<br>
challenges, because the catalyst is in slurry form.<br>
Elaborate efforts have been made to separate the catalyst<br>
to allow regeneration outside the Fischer-Tropsch reactor<br>
or to regenerate it in-situ. The rejuvenation can be<br>
carried out intermittently or continuously.<br><br>
As an example of a regeneration process, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,973,012 describes a reversibly deactivated, particulate<br>
slurry catalyst that is rejuvenated by circulating the<br>
slurry from a slurry body through (i) a gas disengaging<br>
zone to remove gas bubbles from the slurry, (ii) a catalyst<br>
rejuvenation zone in which a catalyst rejuvenating gas<br>
contacts the catalyst in the slurry to rejuvenate it and tc<br>
form a rejuvenated catalyst slurry, and (iii) a means for<br>
returning catalyst to the slurry body. This design appears<br>
to be primarily for use as in-situ regeneration design. The<br>
"in-situ" regeneration offers the advantage of keeping the<br>
catalyst in the slurry matrix; however, it presents many<br>
challenges. Amongst other challenges in-situ regeneration,<br>
the H2 partial pressure in the process is limited due to<br>
the low solubility of H2 in the liquid phase. Typically,<br>
the H2 partial pressure exposed to the catalyst within the<br>
liquid phase is less than about 10% of that in the gas<br>
phase. In addition, the hydrogen used to regenerate may<br>
modify the H2:CO ratio in the reactor for some time.<br>
Further still, the temperature may be limited by the<br>
boiling point and/or cracking properties of the liquid<br>
slurry constituents. For these reasons, "in situ"<br>
regeneration has real limitations.<br>
Further on it is known to regenerate a Fischer-Tropsch-<br>
Catalyst by a process for converting light hydrocarbons<br>
into heavier hydrocarbons (C5+) that includes regenerating<br>
a slurry Fischer-Tropsch catalyst in need of regeneration,<br>
the process comprising the steps of: preparing a synthesis<br>
gas using light hydrocarbons; converting the synthesis gas<br>
to Fischer-Tropsch products in a slurry Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reactor containing a slurry Fischer-Tropsch catalyst;<br>
removing Fischer-Tropsch products from the slurry Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor; regenerating the slurry Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalyst that needs regeneration; and wherein the step of<br>
regenerating the slurry Fischer-Tropsch catalyst comprises<br>
the steps of: removing the catalyst from the slurry<br><br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactor; de-waxing and drying the catalyst<br>
sufficiently to produce a free-flowing catalyst powder that<br>
is fluidizable; fluidizing the catalyst powder; treating<br>
the catalyst powder with an oxygen treatment to remove<br>
hydrocarbons from the catalyst powder, reducing the<br>
catalyst powder with a reducing gas, re-slurring the<br>
catalyst powder to form a regenerated slurry catalyst; and<br>
returning the regenerated slurry catalyst to the slurry<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactor (US 6,989,403).<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process for the regeneration of a deactivated,<br>
wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst which is safe and with<br>
which there is no risk either of self-ignition of the<br>
catalyst or of a dust explosion.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a deactivated, wax<br>
covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst can be completely<br>
regenerated by injecting a pumpable suspension of the<br>
deactivated wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst into a hot<br>
gas stream and then separating off the regenerated catalyst<br>
from the gas stream. Self-ignition of the catalyst and dust<br>
explosions are excluded from this process.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the<br>
regeneration of a deactivated, wax covered Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalyst, comprising injecting a pumpable suspension of the<br>
deactivated wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst into a hot<br>
gas stream and subsequently separating off the regenerated<br>
catalyst from the gas stream.<br>
The process according to the invention is particularly<br>
advantageous for the regeneration of a deactivated wax<br>
covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. Since in this case, the<br>
catalyst is already present in from of a slurry.<br><br>
In the process according to the invention, the regenerated<br>
catalyst can be separated off dry from the gas stream or it<br>
can be scrubbed out from the gas stream with formation of e<br>
suspension.<br>
Deactivated catalysts suitable for regeneration according<br>
to the present invention preferably have a mean particle<br>
size between 1 urn and 300 urn.<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts means all typs of FT-catalysis<br>
especially cobalt-contaiming catalysts.<br>
The process according to the invention can be particularly<br>
advantageously carried out if the hot gas stream, into<br>
which the suspension of the deactivated wax covered<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is injected, is in a turbulent<br>
flow state.<br>
The oxygen content of the hot gas stream is preferably 5 to<br>
20% by volume, particularly preferably 8. to 12% by volume.<br>
The temperature of the hot gas stream is preferably 300 °C.<br>
to 1050 °C, particularly preferably 600 °C to 850 °C.<br>
The residence time of the deactivated catalyst in the hot<br>
gas stream is preferably 0.01 to 10 sec, particularly<br>
preferably 0.1 to 2 sec.<br>
The thus regenerated catalyst can be further treated by a<br>
calcination step and/or reduction step.<br>
The process of the present invention can suitably be<br>
carried out as follows: A pumpable suspension of the<br>
deactivated wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is<br>
continuously injected into an oxygen-containing, turbulent,<br>
preheated gas stream having a temperature of about 700 °C<br>
to 900 °C. Water, if present at all, evaporates very<br>
rapidly. Immediately thereafter a sudden degassing of the<br>
deactivated catalyst takes place. The escaping gas burns<br><br>
immediately and reheats the gas stream which has lost heat<br>
by the evaporation of water and/or lighter hydrocarbons. A<br>
very rapid burning off of the carbon compounds in the<br>
catalyst particles then takes place, since the catalyst<br>
particles are freely suspended in the gas stream and the<br>
gas exchange proceeds extremely rapidly. By equally rapid<br>
release of the energy of the particles to the gas stream,<br>
via heat conduction and particle impact, overheating of the<br>
particles, as could occur in the case of uncontrolled<br>
oxygen feed to a packed bed of catalyst material as a<br>
result of heat transmission by radiation, is reliably<br>
prevented. The particles are then separated off from the<br>
gas stream. It is possible to insert a further step for<br>
heat recovery, for example for preheating the combustion<br>
air.<br>
The regeneration according to the invention of a<br>
deactivated catalyst can be carried out, for example, in a<br>
TURAKTOR (an apparatus available from the Eisenmann company<br>
for the thermal treatment of waste materials). In such an<br>
apparatus, an annular channel is impinged tangentially by a<br>
hot gas from a burner. The hot gas flows from the annular<br>
channel through vanes into the interior and in the course<br>
of this is set in rapid circulation.<br>
The circulating hot gas travels upwards in a spiral motion<br>
along the walls in the actual turbulator chamber. As a<br>
result of the high gas velocity at the bottom, a part-<br>
stream is sucked back into the center where it mixes with<br>
fresh hot gas. The suspension of the deactivated catalyst<br>
is injected into this central backflow via a spray nozzle<br>
furnished with a water cooling jacket and having a two-<br>
component nozzle. Because of the high gas velocities and<br>
turbulences achieved after a short pathway, the catalyst<br>
particles are very finely distributed, the lighter<br>
hydrocarbons of the wax evaporate virtually instantaneously<br>
and the burning off of the heavier hydrocarbons of the wax<br><br>
or of hydrogen-deficient hydrocarbons on the catalyst<br>
particles proceeds extremely rapidly as a result of the<br>
minimized mass transport limitation. At the same time, good<br>
heat exchange is ensured between the hot gas and the<br>
catalyst particles. The temperatures are measured in the<br>
clean, hot gas in the annular channel and at the outlet of<br>
the equipment. Air can be additionally added into the<br>
equipment chamber by a further annular channel. An<br>
inspection glass permits observation of the flame vortex.<br>
The exhaust gas stream passes through a delay time section<br>
of generally approximately 3 m in length. The first<br>
separation of burnt-out, regenerated catalyst particles<br>
then proceeds in a hot cyclone. The exhaust gas is then<br>
cooled via an air preheater before the exhaust gas is freed<br>
from the residual catalyst particles by circulating a<br>
liquid like for instance water or a suitable hydrocarbon in<br>
a venturi scrubber and is conducted away into the stack by<br>
a downstream suction fan. The current oxygen content of the<br>
exhaust gas is measured there via an oxygen analyzer.<br>
The process according to the invention can be used to<br>
remove the wax from the deactivated wax-covered Fischer-<br>
Tropsch catalysts. Furtheron, it can be used to oxidize the<br>
catalyst or/and to reduce the catalyst after having been<br>
freed from the wax.<br>
The calcination and/or reduction step can be done in a<br>
separate kiln or a separate fluidbed reactor.<br>
According to the invention it is possible to combine the<br>
steps of the removing of the wax and the oxidation of the<br>
catalyst into one single step, if the process is done with<br>
an oxygen containing gas stream.<br>
The process according to the invention is much faster than<br>
the known methods to regenerate the deactivated wax covered<br>
Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.<br><br>
Claims:<br>
1.	A process for the regeneration of a deactivated, wax<br>
covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, comprising:<br>
injecting a pumpable liquid suspension of a deactivated<br>
wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst into a gas stream<br>
at from 600 °C to 1050 °C. to regenerate said catalyst,<br>
and<br>
separating off the regenerated catalyst from the gas<br>
stream,<br>
wherein the residence time of said deactivated catalyst<br>
in said qas stream is from 0.01 to 10 sec.<br>
2.	The process according to claim 1, wherein the<br>
regenerated catalyst is further treated by a<br>
calcintration step and/or reduction step.<br>
3.	The process according to claim 1, wherein said<br>
regenerated catalyst is separated off dry from the gas<br>
stream.<br>
4.	The process according to claim 1-3, wherein said<br>
regenerated catalyst is scrubbed out from the gas stream<br>
forming a suspension.<br>
5.	The process according to claim 1-4, wherein said gas<br>
stream is in a turbulent flow state.<br>
6.	The process according to claim 1-5, wherein the oxygen<br>
content of said gas stream is of from 5 to 20% by<br>
volume, based on the total volume of said hot gas<br>
stream.<br><br>
7. The process according to claim 1-6, wherein the oxygen<br>
content of said gas stream is of from 8 to 12% by<br>
volume, based on the total volume of said hot gas<br>
stream.<br>
8.	The process according to claim 1, wherein the<br>
temperature of said hot gas stream is of from 600 °C to<br>
850 °C.<br>
9.	The process according to claim 1, wherein the residence<br>
time of said deactivated Fischer-Tropsch catalyst in<br>
said gas stream is of from 0.1 to 2 sec.<br>
10.	The process of claim 1, wherein said liquid suspension<br>
is a suspension comprising hydrocarbons and catalyst.<br>
11.	The process of claim 1, wherein said liquid suspension<br>
contains 10 to 80% by weight solids.<br><br>
The invention relates to a process for the regeneration of a deactivated wax covered Fischer-Tropsch catalyst, a pumpable suspension of deactivated catalyst being injected into a hot gas stream and the regenerated catalyst then being separated off from the gas stream, optionally further treated by calcination<br>
and/or reduction.</td>
