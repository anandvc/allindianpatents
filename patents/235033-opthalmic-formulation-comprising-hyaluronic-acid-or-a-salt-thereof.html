				<td>SODIUM HYALURONATE BASED OPHTHALMIC FORMULATION FOR USE IN EYE<br>
SURGERY<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an ophthalmic formulation, for use in<br>
eye surgery, comprising sodium hyaluronate, citrate, at least one<br>
antioxidant tolerated by the intraocular tissues and a phosphate<br>
buffer.<br>
Particularly, the present invention will comprise sodium hyaluronate<br>
having molecular weight from 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 Daltons.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Sodium hyaluronate (NaHA) based solutions have already been used for<br>
some time in eye surgery.<br>
Loss of corneal endothelial cells and elevation in intra-ocular<br>
pressure (P.I.0.) after cataract operations with or without<br>
implantation of intraocular lenses are two negative consequences of<br>
such operations. Particularly, loss of endothelial cells can cause<br>
serious problems since such cells do not regenerate.<br>
As for causes of elevation in pressure and mechanisms related with the<br>
loss of endothelial cells, various hypothesis have been suggested<br>
(Liesegang, T.J., 1990, Survey Ophtalmol., 34, 268-293). Nevertheless,<br>
the problems are still unsolved and the discovery of novel<br>
viscoelastic products able to limit or eliminate injuries resulting<br>
from operation, is still of great interest for safety of eye surgery.<br>
Sodium hyaluronate of pharmaceutical purity has already been used in<br>
production of solutions for eye surgery and various methods of<br>
preparation of the polymer having molecular weight from about 150,000<br>
to about 6,000,000 Daltons are likewise known (U.S. Patent 4,141,973).<br>
Products which are at present in use have determined a great progress<br>
in eye surgery, for example in cataract operation.<br>
Particularly, the product commercially known as HealoR trade-mark, by<br>
Kabi Pharmacia, containing 1% of hyaluronic acid having molecular<br>
weight of about 4,000,000 Daltons and a viscosity of about 200 cps<br>
which appears to be the most used product in the world, has ideal<br>
rheologic characteristics for eye microviscosurgery. Nevertheless, it<br>
presents the serious inconvenience that it has to be removed from the<br>
eye after operation. As a matter of fact, HealonR which remains in the<br>
eye causes pathologic elevation in P.I.0. (Shubert et al., 1984, Exp.<br>
Eye Res., 39. 137-152) and just a slight defence of endothelium.<br>
Nevertheless, removal of HealonR from the eye performed by the surgeon<br>
after the operation is not likely to be complete and HealonR traces<br>
usually remain in the eye even after removal, with the result of<br>
evident consequences for the patient.<br>
Phacoemulsification has recently become the most used technique as for<br>
cataract operation. Advantages of such technique compared to<br>
techniques previously used can be summarized in a smaller incision,<br>
shorter time required for the operation and a more rapid<br>
rehabilitation of the patient. Nevertheless, this technique doesn't<br>
permit to cancel the postoperative elevation in P.I.0., in both cases<br>
in which HealonR or one of the other substances known in Literature<br>
are used as viscoelastic substances, and it might cause complications<br>
to the corneal endothelium, owing to manipulation performed by the<br>
surgeon in the anterior chamber of the patient's eye.<br>
Injuries to the corneal endothelium caused by phacoemulsification have<br>
been related to mechanical trauma caused by surgical manipulation and<br>
by irrigation of the eye with salt solutions.<br>
Therefore, it would be important to provide a novel composition able<br>
to eliminate the dangerous inconveniences which can result from small<br>
amounts of HealonR which remain in the eye, besides those which can<br>
result from inconveniences owing to mechanical removal of HealonR from<br>
the eye which has been operated upon, immediately after operation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The author of the present invention surprisingly found an ophthalmic<br>
formulation, comprising hyaluronic acid, or a salt thereof, a citric<br>
acid salt, typically tri-sodium citrate, an antioxidant tolerated by<br>
the intraocular tissues and a phosphate buffer, which has such<br>
characteristics to reduce the toxic effects owing to the operation and<br>
which can be left "in situ" without causing any significant elevation<br>
in P.I.O.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation having a viscosity of 18,000 - 36,000 cps at 2 sec-1 and<br>
at 25Â°C, and comprising hyaluronic acid having molecular weight of<br>
1,000,000 - 2,000,000 Daltons and at the concentration of 1.5% - 3.5%<br>
weight by volume, at least one antioxidant tolerated by the<br>
intraocular tissues, citrate at the concentration of 0.01% - 0.05%<br>
weight by volume and phosphate buffer in order to maintain the<br>
formulation isotonic.<br>
Description of Figures<br>

invention: a) non-sonicated, without antioxidant; b) sonicated,<br>
without antioxidant; and c) sonicated, but having sodium ascorbate as<br>
antioxidant.<br>
Values of the shear rate (sec-1) are reported on abscissa and the<br>
viscosity (eta) is reported on ordinate.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention comprises a sodium hyaluronate solution in<br>
combination with a citric acid salt, typically tri-sodium citrate, at<br>
least one antioxidant tolerated by the intraocular tissues in isotonic<br>
salt solution buffered at neutral pH.<br>
According to a typically embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
hyaluronic acid salt may be the only viscosity thickener included in<br>
the present formulations.<br>
The method of preparation of the solution object of the present<br>
invention requires mixing of the components under aseptic conditions,<br>
by means of techniques and equipments usual for ophthalmic<br>
preparations.<br>
The resulting formulation has a viscosity of 18,000 -4l,000 cps (cps =<br>
centipoises) at 2 sec-1, at 25Â°C.<br>
Extractive (e.g., from cock comb, umbilical cord, etc.) or<br>
fermentative (e.g., from Streptococcus, ect.) NaHA has a molecular<br>
weight of 1,000,000 - 2,00,000 Daltons and a concentration of 15 - 35<br>
mg/ml, which produces a preparation having a viscosity of 18,000 -<br>
41,000 cps at 2 sec-1 and at 25Â°C, preparation which maintains its own<br>
rheologic characteristics even in presence of substances such as<br>
sodium citrate, an antioxidant, e.g. sodium ascorbate and/or glucose,<br>
phosphate buffer and, if that is the case, sodium chloride, potassium<br>
chloride, magnesium chloride and calcium chloride. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the present formulations have a viscosity of<br>
18,000 to 41,000 cps at a share rate of 2 sec-1, at 25Â°C, and of 550<br>
to 1,250 cps at a share rate of 300 sec , at 25Â°C, corresponding to a<br>
viscosity versus share variation index (ratio of eta 1 sec / eta 300<br>
sec ) of about 33. In the present formulation, the citrate will be<br>
at the concentration of 0.01% - 0.05%, preferably 0.03% weight by<br>
volume.<br>
As antioxidant tolerated by the intraocular tissues, it will be<br>
possible to use at least one of the antioxidants selected from the<br>
group comprising glucose, ascorbate, sulphides, superoxide dismutase<br>
(SOD), cysteine and derivates thereof. Furthermore, other<br>
antioxidants, tolerated by the intraocular tissues, known in<br>
literature, can be used, e.g. hydrosoluble antioxidants, antioxidants<br>
which have at least one -SH or -CH0 group, peptides and enzymes.<br>
Particularly, as antioxidant it will be possible to use sodium<br>
ascorbate at the concentration of 0.01% - 1%, preferably 0.02% weight<br>
by wolume, and/or glucose at the concentration of 0.04% - 4%,<br>
preferably 0.07% weight by volume.<br>
The applicant has unexpectedly found that antioxidants significantly<br>
reduce hyaluronic acid degradation due to sonication following<br>
pharmacoemulsification.<br>
Typically, the present formulations contain an ascorbic acid salt,<br>
such as sodium ascorbate, as the antioxidant, preferably in<br>
association with another antioxidant.<br>
Typical formulations according to the present invention contain both<br>
ascorbate and glucose.<br>
As for phosphate salts based buffer, this is added in an amount<br>
sufficient to produce a neutral isotonic aqueous solution (e.g. pH 7.0<br>
- 7.4, preferably pH 7.2).<br>
According to a particular embodiment, besides the elements mentioned<br>
above, the formulation according to the present invention may comprise<br>
an isotonic salt solution comprising sodium chloride, potassium<br>
chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride and dibasic sodium<br>
phosphate.<br>
Therefore, the formulation according to the present invention may have<br>
the following composition:<br>
- NaHA (M.W. 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 Daltons); 1.5 - 3-5%<br>
- Na3citrate 0.01 - 0.05%<br>
- Sodium ascorbate 0.01 - 1.0%<br>
- glucose 0.04 - 4.0%<br>
- Na2HPO4.12H2O 0.26 - 0.39%<br>
- NaCl 0.54 - 0.81%<br>
- KC1 0.15 - 0.23%<br>
- MgCl2.6H2O 0.01 - 0.02%<br>
- CaCl2.H2O 0.007 - 0.011%<br>
- water up to 100 ml. ; pH 7.0 - 7-4<br>
According to further preferred embodiments, ascorbate concentrations<br>
are of 0.01-0.03%; glucose concentrations are of 0.04-1.00%; NaCl<br>
concentrations are of 0.60-0.70%.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the formulation according<br>
to the present invention may have the following composition:<br>
- NaHA (M.W. 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 Daltons); 2.5%<br>
- Na3Citrate 0.03%<br>
- Sodium ascorbate 0.02%<br>
- glucose 0.07%<br>
- Na2HPO4. 12H2O 0.32%<br>
- NaCl 0.68%<br>
- KC1 0.19%<br>
- MgCl2.6H2O 0.014%<br>
- CaCl2.H2O 0.009%<br>
- water up to 100 ml. ; pH 7.2<br>
Unless otherwise stated, in the present text the % amounts of the<br>
components correspond to weight/volume %.<br>
The aim of the present invention is also achieved using hyaluronic<br>
acid salts other than the sodium salt, as well as Na+ , K+ , Ca++ and<br>
Mg++ salts different from those hereinabove mentioned, preferred<br>
composition containing in addition to 1.5-3.5% weight/volume of a<br>
hyaluronic acid salt, the following amounts of ionic species and of<br>
glucose: Na+ 100-220 mmo/l, and more preferably 100-150 mmol/l (not<br>
included that coming from NaHA); K+ 20-30 mmol/1, typically about 25<br>
mmol/1; Ca++ 0.50-0.90 mmol/1, typically about 0.7 mmol/1; Mg++ 0.40-<br>
1.00 mmol/1, typically about 0.7 mmol/1; CI- 100-180 mmol/1, more<br>
preferably about 140-150 mmol/1; HPO4= 7-0 - 11.00 mmol/1, typically<br>
about 9 mmol/1; citrate 0.30-2.00 mmol/1, typically 0.4-1.2 mmol/1;<br>
ascorbate 0.50-55-00 mmol/1, typically 0.50-1.00 mmol/1; glucose 2.0-<br>
225.00 mmol/1, typically 2.2-5.0 mmol/1.<br>
The formulation according to the present invention has been used in<br>
the ophthalmic surgery in general. Particularly, in the ophthalmic<br>
surgery of the anterior segment (cataract, glaucoma, corneal or<br>
conjunctival pathology, etc.) or of the posterior segment<br>
(vitreumectomy, detachment of retina, etc.) and it proved to be<br>
extremely efficient, particularly during cataract operation and more<br>
particularly during utilization of phacoemulsification.<br>
The formulation according to the present invention appears to fulfil<br>
requirements of viscoelasticity and non-Newtonian behaviour necessary<br>
to the ophthalmic surgery, particularly to the cataract operation,<br>
either in presence or in absence of phacoemulsification. Furthermore,<br>
such formulation shows remarkable advantages when compared to the<br>
preparations on the market used in the eye surgery, that are HealonR<br>
(Kabi Pharmacia) or ViscoatR (Alcon):<br>
i) a lower influence on P.I.0.;<br>
ii) it can be left "in situ" after the operation, instead of being<br>
removed; therefore, it avoids the remaining of residual traces, even<br>
after removal from the eye;<br>
iii) a lower inflammatory effect (phlogosis);<br>
iv) a lower loss of corneal endothelium cells, even when measured just<br>
3 months after the operation.<br>
Now, the present invention will be disclosed in the following example,<br>
according to a particular embodiment and compared to a solution known<br>
by the Prior Art.<br>
The observation that the present formulations are endowed with good<br>
non-Newtonian properties, is in particular unexpected in view of the<br>
teaching of UPS 5.106,615, with reports that amounts of NaCl above<br>
0.01% by weight (i.e. above 1.75 mmoles/l) destroy the non-Newtonian<br>
behaviour of hyaluronate based solutions, and that Ca++ and other<br>
bivalent cations are even more efficient, as well as data showing that<br>
25 mmoles/1 of NaCl abolish such non-Newtonian behaviour.<br>
Viscoelasticity is a Theological property possessed by materials which<br>
are viscous, but also exhibit elastic deformation when stressed<br>
(Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, Mack Publishing Company, 18th<br>
Ed., pages 319~320), whereas non-Newtonian behaviour is a rheological<br>
property, possessed by materials the viscosity of which varies in a<br>
manner not proportional to the applied shear stress (McGraw Hill<br>
Dictionary of Scientific Technical Terms, pages 479, 1010, 1020,<br>
1601). So the two aforementioned properties refer to different<br>
rheological aspects, which may be concurrently present in some<br>
materials, such as for instance in hyaluronate based solutions<br>
substantially free from salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
Comparative test for phacoemulsification<br>
The surprising efficacy of the formulation according to the present<br>
invention was examined in a clinical study with 60 patients with<br>
cataract, patients who were assigned to 3 groups (indicated as GI, GII<br>
and GIII) each of 20 members, operated by means of<br>
phacoemulsification technique described and standardized hereinafter:<br>
-scleral incision (350 microns deep) parallel to the limbus (1-2 mm<br>
behind this one);<br>
-preparation of the scleral tunnel by means of lancet;<br>
-aperture of the anterior chamber (by means of 3.2 mm callipered<br>
(calibrated) blade with inclination 
-input of the viscoelastic solution into the anterior chamber (total<br>
replacement of the aqueous humour);<br>
-capsulorrhexis, hydrodissection and nucleodelineation;<br>
-phacoemulsification (cross technique);<br>
-aspiration of the masses and input of the viscoelastic solution into<br>
the capsular sac;<br>
-implantation of 5 mm intracapsular eye lens;<br>
-aspiration of the HealortR (GI), while the formulation according to<br>
the present invention (GII) and the solution of control (GIII) remain<br>
"in situ";<br>
-apposition of a suture, if that is the case;<br>
The average time of ultrasound used in the phacoemulsification is of<br>
60 seconds +/- 15 seconds. The viscoelastic preparations used in this<br>
test were:<br>
a) HealonR, whose composition is the following one:<br>
HA (M.W. 4,000,000 Daltons) 1.0 g<br>
NaCl 0.85 g<br>
Na2HPO4.2H2O 0.028 g<br>
NaH2PO4.H2O 0.004 g<br>
and water for injectable preparations up to 100 ml,<br>
for the GI;<br>
b) a formulation according to a particular embodiment of the present<br>
invention having the following composition (indicated as SVS 18):<br>
- Hyaluronic acid (M.W. 1,350,000 Daltons); 2.5 g<br>
- Na3citrate 0.031 g<br>
- Sodium ascorbate 0.022 g<br>
- glucose 0.070 g<br>
- Na2HPO4. 12H2O 0.322 g<br>
- NaCl O.678 g<br>
- KC1 0.194 g<br>
- MgCl2.6H2O 0.014 g<br>
- CaCl2.H2O 0.009 g<br>
- water for injectable preparations up to 100 ml. ; pH 7.2<br>
for GII; and<br>
c) a preparation of a control salt solution containing:<br>
HA (M.W. 1,350,000 Daltons) 2.5 g<br>
NaCl 0.850 g<br>
Na2HPO4.2H2O 0.322 g<br>
NaH2PO4.H2O 0.004 g<br>
water for injectable preparations up to 100 ml, pH 7.2<br>
for the GUI;<br>
GI was constituted of 12 men and 8 women being the average age of 60<br>
years (range 35 - 72), GII was constituted of 11 men and 9 women being<br>
the average age of 62 years (range 38 - 72) and GIII was constituted<br>
of 11 men and 9 women being the average age of 61 years (range 34 -<br>
73).<br>
All operations were performed by the same surgeon, who always used the<br>
same technique, the same amount of viscoelastic substance and who<br>
removed the HealoR after the operation, while he left "in situ" the<br>
formulation according to the present invention and the salt solution<br>
of control.<br>
After the operation, all patients were treated with a subconjunctival<br>
injection of 6 mg of betamethasone and with a dexamethasone and<br>
tobramycin based collyrium.<br>
The topic therapy was performed for 3 weeks every morning and it was<br>
associated with 1% tropicamide based collyrium.<br>
Parameters which were considered in this study were:<br>
intra-ocular pressure (P.I.O.) evaluated by means of applanation<br>
tonometry the day before the operation and then after 6 hours, 12<br>
hours, 1, 7. 30 and 60 days; it must be recalled to memory that<br>
physiologic value of intra-ocular pressure is 
postoperative inflammation was valued after 1, 3. 7, 30 and 60 days<br>
after the operation and it was expressed by arbitrary units (0 =<br>
absent, + = slight, ++ = intermediate, +++ = intense); number and<br>
morphology of endothelial cells were evaluated by Zeiss specular<br>
endothelial microscopy before the operation and after 2 months.<br>
Results are reported in Tables 1, 2 and 3. respectively. By observing<br>
such Tables 1, 2 and 3. it is possible to assert what follows:<br>
i) the formulation according to the present invention (SVS 18 of GII)<br>
relative to the HealonR can be left "in situ" after the operation,<br>
which not only doesn't cause elevation in pressure (on the contrary,<br>
after 6 hours the group treated with HealonR that is GI, has an<br>
average pressure of 21+/-7mmHg against 18+/-6 mmHg of GII) (Table 1),<br>
but it also explains the lower incidence of postoperative phlogosis<br>
during the first day after the operation (Table 2);<br>
ii) the formulation according to the present invention is the<br>
viscoelastic substance which permits the lower loss of endothelial<br>
cells ( -7% two months after the operation), while the group wherein<br>
HealonR was used (GI) did undergo a loss of 11% during the same period<br>
of 2 months (Table 3);<br>
iii) the difference on endothelial cells between the two GII and GIII<br>
groups treated with SVS 18 and with the control salt solution<br>
respectively, is a clear evidence of the favourable effect of the<br>
formulation according to the present invention comprising the citrate<br>
and at least one antioxidant (as for the present case, sodium<br>
ascorbate and glucose) with respect to the one wherein sodium<br>
hyaluronate at the same concentration and having the same molecular<br>
weight is in buffered salt solution, only (Table 3).<br>
By observing Figure 1, it can be noted that the SVS18 solution has a<br>
viscosity versus share rate variation index (ratio of eta 1 sec-1/eta<br>
300 sec-1) of 33.6, while the same value is of 24.6 for the salt<br>
solution (GIII). The result is that the SVS18 has a viscosity versus<br>
share rate variation index of +27% with respect to the salt solution.<br>
For the purpose of its utilization in ophthalmic surgery, in<br>
particular in cataract operation, the most important rheologic<br>
characteristic is the viscosity versus shear rate variation index,<br>
considered as ratio between two viscosity (low shear rate viscosity,<br>
non-moving fluid and high shear rate viscosity, fluid under mechanical<br>
stress).<br>
The viscosity versus shear rate variation index is a measure of the<br>
versatility of a non-Newtonian substance, wherein the higher the index<br>
is, the more versatile the non-Newtonian fluid is from a rheologic<br>
point of view and therefore it will show a better behaviour during<br>
the operation.<br>
The increase of +27% of the index, reported in Figure 1, confirms the<br>
fact that the SVS18 solution has rheologic characteristics more<br>
suitable for the needs of the operation exactly because of its<br>
peculiar formulation, making it superior over the salt solution.<br>
Example 2<br>
Effect of the antioxidants on sonicated formulations<br>
The effect of stabilization of the degradation of a sodium hyaluronate<br>
sonicated solution with a phacoemulsificator has been evaluated by<br>
means of addition of antioxidants.<br>
Different formulations were prepared. The first one corresponded to<br>
the one reported in Example 1, but without antioxidants (neither<br>
glucose, nor ascorbate), while the other ones corresponded to the<br>
previous formulation, but comprising ascorbic acid at 0.02% as well as<br>
glucose 0.07% weight/volume.<br>
Such solutions were sonicated for 5 minutes with a Alcon mod.<br>
Universal phacoemulsificator. The degradation of the sodium<br>
hyaluronate solution was monitored by means of viscosimetric measures<br>
performed before and after sonication with a BOHLIN VOR viscosimeter<br>
(Bohlin AG).<br>
The results which were obtained are shown in Figure 2, wherein a flow<br>
curve of a solution according to the present invention a)non-<br>
sonicated, without antioxidant; b)sonicated, without antioxidant; and<br>
c)sonicated, but having sodium ascorbate as antioxidant, is reported.<br>
By observing the flow curves Showed in Figure 2, which were obtained<br>
for the formulation containing sodium ascorbate, a higher viscosity<br>
and a stabilization of about 20% relative to the sonicated solution<br>
without sodium ascorbate were observed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of an aqueous<br>
sodium hyaluronate solution, having molecular weight of 1,000,000 -<br>
2,000,000 Daltons and a concentration of 1.5% - 3.5% weight by volume<br>
in combination with 0.01% - 0.05% weight by volume of citrate, and at<br>
least one antioxidant tolerated by the intraocular tissues and a<br>
phosphate buffer for the preparation of an ophthalmic formulation,<br>
where the obtained ophthalmic formulation has a viscosity of 18,000 -<br>
41,000 cps at 2 sec-1 at 25Â°C.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a therapeutic method of<br>
ophthalmic surgery by means of utilization for the eye of a<br>
viscoelastic sodium hyaluronate based formulation according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Particularly, the present invention relates to a therapeutic method of<br>
ophthalmic surgery of the anterior segment (cataract, glaucoma,<br>
corneal or conjunctival pathology, etc.) or posterior segment<br>
(vitreumectomy, detachment of retina, etc.). More particularly, it<br>
relates to a method of cataract operation by means of<br>
phacoemulsification, of glaucoma operation by means of trabeculectomy,<br>
of corneal operation (keratoplasty), etc.<br>
