				<td>This invention relates to NSV combo instrument of choice for performing male sterilization. It is a safe, permanent method and is simple and effective. It has been made simple by the advent of No Scalpel Vasectomy (NVS). The method involves no cut, no stitch and is almost painless. The NSV is performed with the help of three instruments: vas dissection forceps, vas fixation forceps and the scissors. In this new invention the scissors is integrated into the vas dissection forceps thereby reducing the instruments required for NSV into two which results in the saving of time in the performance of No Scalpel Vasectomy and the elegance and the rhythm of the procedure would not be interrupted.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The No Scalpel Vasectomy is performed with the help of three instruments: vas dissection forceps, vas fixation forceps and the scissors. Vas dissection forceps is used to puncture the scrotal skin and dissect and elevate the vas deferens. The second instrument known as vas fixation forceps is used to fix the vas in the midline of scrotum. After fixing the vas at the chosen place the skin of scrotum is punctured and the vas which is fixed just under the skin is dissected and elevated out of the puncture hole. In the next step a segment of the vas is cleared of all extra tissues with the vas dissection forceps then it is tied at either end with piece of silk. The intervening vas is cut with scissors. The silk is also cut to right size with the scissors and the cut vas is returned to the scrotum. Next, the second side is brought out in a similar fashion out of the same puncture hole. It is also cut and tied. All these steps are done in rhythmic manner in fixed sequence.<br>
The scissors is the odd instrument out in this sequence. It cuts while the other two dissect. The other two instruments operate in tandem while the scissors breaks the rhythm. The<br>
surgeon has to take his sight away from the field of surgery to pick up the scissor, bring into the field of operation and cut. It breaks the rhythm and results in loss of time particularly in high volume situations. It is not uncommon to do 100 cases in vasectomy camp. If it were possible to integrate the scissors into one of the instruments the time would be saved and the elegance and the rhythm of the procedure would not be interrupted. This has been done in the new invention. Modified instrument for No Scalpel Vasectomy<br>
NSV Combo Instrument is a Combination of a vas dissection forceps and a scissors. In this new invention the scissors is integrated into the vas dissection forceps thereby reducing the instruments required for NSV into two which results in the saving of time in the performance of NSV and the elegance and the rhythm of the procedure would not be interrupted. This instrument has the unique feature that a scissors has been incorporated into a vas dissection forceps. As a result of this incorporation the vas which is brought out of the wound by the dissection forceps can be cut with the scissors within the vas dissection forceps. As a result of this incorporation the vas which is brought out of the wound by the dissection forceps can be cut with the scissors within the vas dissection forceps. The sutures are also cut to right length with the same scissors and the vas returned to scrotum.<br>
The NSV combo instrument consists of two limbs which has the same features and joined by a screw at the middle portion of the instrument. The NSV combo instrument has a total length of 135 mm and can be divided into three parts:<br>
(a) The upper portion:   The upper portion of the NSV Combo Instrument is to perform the function of a vas dissection forceps. This portion is 16 mm in length from the spear sharp<br>
point beak of the NSV Combo Instrument towards the lower bottom. The width at the base of this portion, i.e. at the 16 mm from the tip is 4 mm at the vertical plane and it decreases towards the sharp pointed tip. This spear sharp point of the beak has a curve of 30° towards bottom when the instrument is held in proper usage position.<br>
(b)	Middle portion: The middle portion of NSV combo instrument performs the function of a<br>
scissors.    The scissors is incorporated into the middle portion of this NSV Combo<br>
Instrument.   This portion is of 30 mm length from the lower end of the upper portion<br>
(forceps portion) i.e. from the 16 mm from the spear sharp point of the beak. The width of<br>
this portion in a horizontal plane varies from the top to the bottom. It has a width of 4 mm<br>
at a point of 16 mm from the sharp pointed beak, then it lean to a width of 3.5 mm at the 23<br>
mm and then widens to a width of 5 mm at 33 mm from the spear sharp point tip of the<br>
instrument, thereby giving a small curve in the scissors part.   The screw which joins the<br>
two limbs of the instrument are fixed at a point of 37 mm from the tip of the NSV Combo<br>
Instrument.   The width broadens towards the lower part of the middle portion of NSV<br>
Combo Instrument and reaches a width of 7 mm at the 44 mm and then decreases to 3.5<br>
mm at the 46 mm.<br>
(c)	The lower portion: This portion is from the bottom of the middle portion (i.e. the bottom of<br>
scissors portion) to the bottom of the NSV Combo Instrument.   The total length of this<br>
portion is 89 mm in length.   This portion is from the bottom of middle portion (i.e. the<br>
bottom of scissors portion which is at a point of 46 mm from the tip of NSV Combo<br>
Instrument) and it extends upto the lower bottom of the instrument which has a ring slightly<br>
oval in shape (which is little broader at the base and narrowing towards the top) on each of<br>
the limb of the instrument so as to hold the instrument with fingers. The width at the upper<br>
part (i.e. at 46 mm from sharp pointed tip) of this portion is 3.5 mm and it decreases to 2.5 mm at a point of 80 mm. The width at the center of the inner circle of the ring in a horizontal plane is 20.8 mm and the width in the vertical plane from the highest point of the ring to the lowest point is 24.8 mm. The width at the outer surface of the ring at the broadest point in a horizontal plane is 25 mm and in the vertical plane it is 29 mm. The rings, at the bottom of the instrument, has a distance of 29 mm between them when the instrument is in unlocked position and the distance is reduced to 20 mm when the instrument is in locked position. The locking is done with the protruding part, fixed on each limb of the instrument, at a point of 99 mm from the sharp edged tip of the instrument. This protruding part has a length of 9mm in a horizontal plane and the width at the tip of this protruding part is 3.80 mm in a vertical plane. This protruding part has grooves for locking the instrument.<br>
NSV Combo Instrument comprising a vas dissection forceps, characterized in that a scissors having two limbs with screw at the middle portion of said instrument, said vas dissection forceps having upper portion with spear sharp point, said spear sharp point beak having a curve of at least 30 degrees towards bottom.<br>
