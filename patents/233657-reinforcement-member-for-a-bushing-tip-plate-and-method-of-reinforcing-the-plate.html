				<td>REINFORCEMENT MEMBER FOR A BUSHING TIP PLATE AND METHOD OF REINFORCING THE<br>
PLATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL<br>
APPLICABILITY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to bushings for forming fibers from a fluid<br>
material, such as glass at an elevated temperature and more particularly, to an improved<br>
manner of reinforcing a bushing tip plate to extend the service life thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various types of bushings or bushing assemblies for forming fibers or filaments<br>
from a fluid material, such as glass at an elevated temperature, are known in the art.<br>
Usually, the bushing or bushing assembly includes a rectangular bushing body having<br>
sidewalls and end walls. Together, the side and end walls serve as a frame for supporting<br>
or carrying one or more, often elongated plate-like structures, typically formed of platinum<br>
or alloys thereof, having a plurality of small orifices or "tips." These tips receive the<br>
molten material as it passes through the bushing body from an upstream source, such as a<br>
forehearth. To assist in keeping the material in a molten state as it enters and passes<br>
through these tips, the plates are heated, usually by electrically coupling them to a source<br>
of high current, such as a transformer. As molten glass material streams exit the tips, they<br>
are mechanically drawn to form continuous fibers which are wound onto mandrels or<br>
creels or directly chopped for later processing or use. A detailed description of the basic<br>
apparatus and methodology used is found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,709,727 to Bobba and 3,920,430 to Carey, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
To improve the output and efficiency of the overall fiber-forming operation, it is of<br>
course desirable to maximize the number of fibers created by the tip plate. To do so, a tip<br>
plate can in theory be made infinitely large in both the width and length dimensions.<br>
However, several well-recognized problems arise, especially when the width dimension of<br>
a tip plate is significantly increased relative to the length dimension.<br>
Perhaps the most prevalent problem resulting from increasing the dimensions of<br>
the tip plate, and in particular, the width dimension, to the degree necessary to realize a<br>
significant increase in fiber output is a sharp reduction in the service life. The tip plate is<br>
normally rectangular in top plan view, with its four side edges welded directly to the<br>
opposed side and end walls of the rectangular bushing body. When the width dimension<br>
of the tip plate increases relative to the length dimension, the plate essentially acts as a<br>
simple beam supported at the sides and ends, with no direct support at the "middle" (that<br>
is, the portion furthest from the side and end walls of the corresponding bushing body).<br>
Significant bending stresses acting on the tip plate as the result of prolonged contact with<br>
the heavy molten material over time results in sagging due to time dependent plastic<br>
deformation, or creep. This sagging is deleterious primarily because it results in non-<br>
uniform thermal distribution and the concomitant production of fibers having substantially<br>
different diameters across the tip plate. That is, the extremes in temperature cause some<br>
bushing tips to become too cold to attenuate a fiber and others are hot enough to cause a<br>
forming instability. Both cases cause fiber breakage and a loss in conversion efficiency.<br>
Reducing the width dimension of the plate is therefore desirable to curtail the<br>
effects of creep and increase the service life. However, the trade-off is an undesirable<br>
reduction in output and a concomitant increase in cost when only a single narrow-width tip<br>
plate is used. Also, after prolonged use, even a single narrow-width tip plate eventually<br>
suffers from creep-induced sagging, non-uniform fiber output, and increased fiber break<br>
rates.<br>
In an effort to increase the service life of a bushing tip plate to overcome this<br>
problem and others, the present Assignee has in the past employed reinforcing members<br>
formed of platinum or a platinum alloy, termed "gussets." These gussets usually extend<br>
width-wise across the upper surface of the tip plate (that is, between the sidewalls of the<br>
bushing body) at spaced intervals, and typically have a cross-section that corresponds in<br>
shape to a "T" or inverted "L." In use, me depending "leg" formed by the web of each<br>
gusset is secured directly to the upper surface of the tip plate, such as by laser or tungsten-<br>
inert gas (TIG) welding.<br>
While these gussets do serve to extend the service life of the tip plate, including<br>
even in the narrow-width case, the degree of the benefit gained is somewhat limited. In<br>
particular, the gussets having a T-shaped or inverted L-shaped cross-section are also<br>
susceptible to sagging due to bending stresses and creep as the underlying tip plate. This is<br>
because the gusset, while providing some reinforcement strength, also behaves like a<br>
simple beam, and thus experiences maximum deflection at the span midpoint as in an<br>
unsupported tip plate. In other words, despite the reinforcement, the maximum or peak<br>
stress and hence, the maximum or peak sag, still occurs at the middle of the tip plate away<br>
from the side and end walls. Accordingly, a need for an improved manner of reinforcing<br>
tip plates, including those existing bushing designs (with or without gussets) with an eye<br>
toward further extending their service life is identified.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, a reinforcement member for a<br>
bushing assembly having a plate-like structure including a plurality of orifices for forming<br>
fibers from a fluid material is provided. The member comprises a body including a first<br>
portion for attachment to the structure and a second portion having a profile with a<br>
variable height including at least one apex. The variable height profile and the at least one<br>
apex of the body assists in reinforcing the plate-like structure against sagging and extends<br>
the service life thereof without undue alloy usage.<br>
In one embodiment, the reinforcement member is comprised of a single piece of<br>
material, with the body including the first and second portions having an inverted L-<br>
shaped, T-shaped, or F-shaped cross-section. The profile of the second portion of the body<br>
may have an inverted V-shaped, inverted W-shaped, or arcuate profile. Preferably, the<br>
body has a length including a midpoint, with the at least one apex located substantially at<br>
the midpoint. The midpoint may also be the midpoint between the spaced sidewalls or<br>
external support points of the bushing assembly to which a first and a second end of the<br>
body are secured.<br>
In other embodiments, the body comprises a first member defining the first portion<br>
for attachment to the structure and a second member coupled with the first member,<br>
defining the second portion and having the variable height profile with the at least one<br>
apex. The first member may have a T-shape or an inverted L-shape in cross-section.<br>
Likewise, the second member may have a T-shape or an inverted L-shape in cross-section,<br>
and may be formed from one or more component parts. Additionally, the second portion<br>
may have an arcuate profile, an inverted V-shaped profile, or an inverted W-shaped<br>
profile, each including the at least one apex. Preferably, the second member includes a<br>
web having an end that is welded directly to an upper surface of the first member, and<br>
optionally may have a profile that defines two or more apexes. In any of the embodiments,<br>
either the first or second portion of the body may include a plurality of strategically<br>
positioned openings. These openings serve to reduce the amount of material required to<br>
fabricate the reinforcement member without compromising the strength thereof.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a bushing assembly for use of<br>
forming a plurality of fibers from a fluid material at an elevated temperature is disclosed.<br>
The assembly comprises a structure having a plurality of orifices through which the fluid<br>
material passes to form the fibers and at least one reinforcement member. This member<br>
comprises a first portion for attachment to the structure and a second portion having a<br>
profile with a variable height including at least one apex. The variable height of the<br>
reinforcement member including the at least one apex enhances the ability of the structure<br>
to resist sagging and extends the service life thereof while minimizing the amount of<br>
precious metal used for reinforcement<br>
The fiber forming structure is typically plate-like, with different width and length<br>
dimensions to form a rectangular shape. In one embodiment, at least one reinforcement<br>
member extends along a width dimension of the plate, and preferably a plurality of<br>
independent, spaced reinforcement members extend width-wise along the plate-like<br>
structure. The fiber-forming structure also has an upper surface (the molten glass material<br>
contacts this surface) to which the first portion of each reinforcement member may be<br>
welded. Each reinforcement member maybe fabricated from either a single piece of<br>
material or at least two pieces of material secured together, such as by welding.<br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the invention, a reinforcement member portion<br>
for use in a bushing assembly having a fiber-forming tip plate including at least one<br>
existing gusset is provided. The reinforcement member portion comprises a body for<br>
attachment to the gusset and having a profile with a variable height including at least one<br>
apex. The variable height and the at least one apex of the reinforcement member portion<br>
assists in reinforcing the gusset and hence, at least the adjacent portion of the tip plate,<br>
against sagging, which extends the service life thereof while minimizing the amount of<br>
precious metal used for reinforcement.<br>
In one embodiment, the gusset has a substantially planar upper surface and the<br>
body of the reinforcement member portion includes a web having a first end that is welded<br>
to the upper surface of the gusset. The body may have a T-shaped or inverted L-shaped<br>
cross section, and the profile of the body may be selected from an arcuate profile, an<br>
inverted V-shaped profile, or an inverted W-shaped profile.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the invention, a method for reinforcing a<br>
structure capable of forming fibers from a fluid material supplied to a bushing is disclosed.<br>
The method comprises securing at least one reinforcement member to the structure, said<br>
reinforcement member comprising a first portion for attachment to the structure and a<br>
second portion having a profile with a variable height including at least one apex. The<br>
variable height of the reinforcement member including the at least one apex enhances the<br>
resistance of the structure to bending stresses and extends the service life thereof while<br>
minimizing the amount of precious metal used for reinforcement.<br>
In one embodiment, the securing step comprises securing a plurality of independent<br>
reinforcement members to the structure in a spaced relationship. The reinforcement<br>
member may comprise a first member defining the first portion and a second member<br>
defining the second portion, in which case the securing step comprises securing the first<br>
member to the structure, and securing the second member to the first member. The fiber<br>
forming structure may further comprise a tip plate including at least one existing gusset, in<br>
which case said method further includes attaching the second portion of the reinforcement<br>
member to the gusset. The reinforcement member second portion thus assists in<br>
preventing both the gusset and the tip plate from sagging as the result of bending stresses<br>
and creep.<br>
In accordance with a fifth aspect of the invention, a reinforcement member for use<br>
in a bushing assembly for forming fibers from a fluid material at an elevated temperature is<br>
provided. The bushing assembly includes a bushing tip plate having an upper surface and<br>
a plurality of strategically positioned fiber-forming orifices. The reinforcement member<br>
comprises a body having a lower portion including a web for attachment to the upper<br>
surface of the bushing tip plate and an upper portion integrally formed with the lower<br>
portion. The upper portion has a profile shaped for resisting both a bending stress created<br>
partially by the weight of the material and a creep created partially by the elevated<br>
temperature of the material over time in combination with the bending stress, and<br>
including at least one apex. The variable height profile of the body including at least one<br>
apex enhances the resistance of the bushing tip plate to sagging and thereby substantially<br>
extends the service life thereof while rninirnizing the amount of precious metal used for<br>
reinforcement.<br>

DETAILS DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference is first made to Fig. 1, which is a schematic illustration of a portion of a<br>
prior art fiber-forming structure wherein a plurality of gussets G1, G2 are attached to the<br>
upper surface Su of a tip plate T (shown in phantom). The tip plate T is formed from<br>
platinum, alloys thereof or a like material, and includes between about 10 and 100 small<br>
tips or orifices O through which molten material, such as glass, passes (see, for example,<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b). The molten material contacts the upper surface Su of the tip plate T prior<br>
to it passing through the orifices O to be drawn into fibers. The gussets G1, G2 are formed<br>
from platinum, alloys thereof, or a like material. As is known in the art, electric current is<br>
typically supplied to the tip plate T from a power source, such as a transformer, to create<br>
resistive heating. This heating helps to maintain the glass or other material in a molten<br>
state as it passes through the orifices O or tips in the plate T. As noted above, a more<br>
detailed description of the overall process is found in the commonly assigned Bobba '727<br>
and Carey '430 patents incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The tip plate T is supported in a bushing body (not shown) having sidewalk and<br>
end walls. Together, the side and end walls serve as a frame for supporting or carrying the<br>
tip plate T.<br>
Over time, the bending stresses created by gravity, fiber tension and the weight of<br>
the molten glass and the concomitant elevated temperature cause the tip plate T to sag,<br>
primarily in the "middle" portion (that is, the portion located farthest away from the side<br>
and end walls of the corresponding bushing body). It is well known that this sagging<br>
reduces the effectiveness of the tip plate T, since it results in a non-uniform thermal<br>
distribution and, hence, the creation of fibers of non-uniform diameters due to uneven heat<br>
transfer to the cooling fins. Production of fibers of non-uniform diameters is undesirable,<br>
and is usually the primary factor that necessitates retiring the tip plate T from service and<br>
replacing it with a new or reconditioned one.<br>
While the T-shaped gussets G1, G2 are initially capable of resisting the bending<br>
stresses, creep causes a time dependent strain that produces a deflection. As the T-shaped<br>
gussets Gl, G2 are simple prismatic beams, that is, constant cross section, the maximum<br>
deflection must occur at the span midpoint under uniform loading. Hence, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the gussets G1, G2 eventually bend or sag along with the tip plate T (note reference<br>
numeral S designating the sagging in the vertical dimension shown for purposes of<br>
illustration).<br>
In an effort to combat this sagging, the present invention includes an improved<br>
reinforcement member 10, which may either be used in place of the conventional gusset(s)<br>
or may be formed by securing or attaching a separate strengthening member to a<br>
conventional gusset(s). Figs. 3a and 3b each illustrate a tip plate T in phantom including a<br>
plurality of spaced reinforcement members 10a, 10b falling into the latter category, and<br>
constructed in accordance with one possible embodiment of the present invention. While<br>
only two reinforcement members 10a, 10b are shown, it should be appreciated that more or<br>
fewer may be provided, depending on the dimensions of the tip plate T and other aspects<br>
of the particular application.<br>
Specifically, as perhaps best shown by viewing Figs. 4a and 4b together with Fig.<br>
3a, each of the plurality of reinforcement members 10a, 10b includes a body having a first,<br>
lower portion 12. As should be appreciated from the foregoing discussion, this portion 12<br>
may comprise a conventional gusset already coupled to the tip plate T, or may form part<br>
(that is, the lower portion) of an uncoupled, complete reinforcement member 10 which is<br>
intended to be secured directly to the planar upper surface of a tip plate T at various<br>
strategic locations.<br>
The lower portion 12 in the illustrated embodiment has a T-shaped cross-section,<br>
including: (1) a relatively thin web 14 having a lower end, along which the weld W or<br>
other bond, such as a mechanical joint, securing the reinforcement member 10a or 10b to<br>
the tip plate T between adjacent rows of orifices O is formed; and (2) a transverse member<br>
16 at the opposite end of the web 14 creating a substantially planar upper surface and<br>
defining at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed flanges 18a, 18b. Alternatively, the<br>
lower portion 12 may be formed from a single piece of T-shaped material fabricated using<br>
stamping, extruding, forging, or other techniques, but this may increase the expense. At<br>
the present time, the less expensive, and thus, preferred manner of forming the<br>
reinforcement member 10a or 10b is by securing the transverse member 16 directly to the<br>
web 14, such as by laser or TIG welding (note welds W in the embodiment shown in Figs.<br>
4a and 4b). The lower portion 12 is preferably formed from platinum, alloys thereof or a<br>
like material.<br>
The reinforcement members 10a, 10b further include an upper portion 20, also<br>
having a T-shaped cross-section including a web 22 and a transverse member 24. This<br>
transverse member 24 thus creates at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed flanges<br>
26a, 26b that define an upper surface US (see Fig. 4a). As with the lower portion 12, these<br>
flanges 26a, 26b may be created using a separate piece of material welded or otherwise<br>
bonded to the upper end of the web 22. However, the use of a single piece of material to<br>
form the upper portion 20 is also possible, such as one constructed using known stamping,<br>
or forging techniques. In this particular embodiment, and as perhaps best shown in Fig. 4a,<br>
the lower end of the web 22 of the upper portion 20 may be attached to the upper surface<br>
of the transverse member 16 of the lower portion 12, such as by welding or any other<br>
means for forming a secure, permanent or semi-permanent bond. The upper portion 20<br>
preferably is formed from the same material used to form the lower portion 12, which<br>
materials are set out above.<br>
The upper portion 20 of each reinforcement member 10a or 10b includes a profile<br>
with a variable height that forms at least one apex A. Thus, in the embodiment of Fig. 3a,<br>
the slope or height of the upper end 22a of the web 22 increases linearly from each end of<br>
the reinforcement member 10a or 10b, such that the apex A is positioned substantially at<br>
the midpoint M along the length thereof (which may also coincide with the midpoint<br>
between the sidewalls of the bushing body (not shown, but see, for example, Figs. 8-10)).<br>
Further, the web 22, in the illustrated embodiment, has triangular-shaped side portions 22b<br>
and 22c, see Figs. 3a and 4b. The transverse member 24 (or members) also assist in<br>
defining this profile.<br>
The end result of this arrangement is that, in terms of susceptibility to bending<br>
stress and creep, the maximum or peak resistance to bending is theoretically provided at<br>
the midpoint M, which is the precise location where the sagging is typically the greatest.<br>
Also, in this particular embodiment, the added weight is kept to a rninimum while still<br>
providing the desired degree of reinforcement by providing the upper portion 20 with a T-<br>
shaped cross-section, as opposed to simply using a solid block of material. By also<br>
forming each reinforcement member 10a or 10b from separate pieces of material<br>
sequentially welded together, the overall cost required for implementing this arrangement<br>
may be minimized. This mode of construction may also allow for the reinforcement<br>
members 10a or 10b to be easily retrofitted onto tip plates T already in service having<br>
existing gusset(s) (in which case only the upper portion 20 of the embodiment shown in<br>
Figs. 3a, 4a, and 4b need be provided).<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3b, the profile of the upper portion 20, including the<br>
transverse members) 24, varies in height and includes at least one apex A. However, the<br>
web 22 is asymmetrical, with each side having a different slope. As a result, the apex A<br>
does not fell at the midpoint M (note dashed vertical lines) between the ends of the lower<br>
portion 12 of the reinforcement member 10a, 10b (or the sidewalls of the bushing body, in<br>
the case where the ends of the lower portion 12 of the reinforcement member are<br>
coextensive therewith). This arrangement or any variation thereof may be useful in special<br>
situations where the location of the maximum bending stress across the tip plate T is not<br>
necessarily at the midpoint M or other design criteria preclude placing the apex at the<br>
midpoint. In these situations, the approximate location for placing the apex A may be<br>
determined empirically or predicted using well-known analytical or other modeling<br>
techniques, such as finite element analysis.<br>
Fig. 5a is a side elevational view and Fig. 5b is a cross-sectional view of another<br>
embodiment of a reinforcement member 110. In this embodiment, the lower and upper<br>
portions 112,120 are defined by a single piece of material having a T-shaped cross-<br>
section, but may be defined by two separate pieces of material. More specifically, the<br>
lower portion 112 is defined by a lower portion 114a of a single, vertically oriented web<br>
114. The lowermost end of this web 114 is attached to the surface of the tip plate T, such<br>
as by welding, between adjacent rows of orifices O extending along the width thereof.<br>
The upper portion 120 of the reinforcement member 110 includes an upper portion<br>
114b of the web 114, as well as at least one transverse member 124 attached to the upper<br>
end thereof. The transverse member 124 defines at least one, and preferably a pair of<br>
opposed flanges 126a, 126b. As with the embodiments described above, the flanges 126a,<br>
126b may instead be separately attached, such as by welding or other permanent or semi-<br>
permanent bonding (see Fig. 5a). The upper portion 120 of the reinforcement member<br>
110, including the transverse members) 124 and the upper web portion 114b, also has a<br>
variable height when viewed in profile to define at least one apex A. As with the<br>
embodiment in Fig. 3a, the apex A is shown as being located substantially at the midpoint<br>
M between the ends of the reinforcement member 110. By positioning the apex A at this<br>
location, which is typically where the maximum bending stress is created, the ability of the<br>
corresponding portion of the tip plate T to resist sagging is greatly enhanced, which in turn<br>
extends the service life. As noted above, it should be appreciated that the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 5a could also be constructed such that the apex A (or multiple apexes; see,<br>
for example, Fig. 10) does not coincide with the midpoint M. This arrangement may be<br>
useful in cases where the maximum stress or bending might not be at the midpoint M or<br>
other design criteria precludes placing the apex at the span midpoint.<br>
Fig. 5a also demonstrates one manner in which apertures or openings 130 may also<br>
be provided in the reinforcement member 110, such as in the web 124. These apertures or<br>
openings 130 reduce the overall amount of material required during fabrication, and thus<br>
reduce the cost and weight contribution of each reinforcement member 110. However, the<br>
openings 130 are sized and strategically positioned such that no significant reduction in the<br>
resistance to bending stresses or sagging results. In the example shown, three such<br>
openings 130 are provided, but fewer or more may be provided. Also, while circular<br>
openings 130 are shown for purposes of illustration, it should be appreciated that any<br>
shape may be used, as long as the result is that the reinforcement in strength provided to<br>
the tip plate T remains uncompromised. Moreover, while the openings 130 are shown in<br>
the embodiment of Fig. 5a, it should be appreciated that any of the other embodiments may<br>
benefit from their presence, either in the upper portion (see, for example, Fig. 9), the lower<br>
portion (not shown), or in both portions of the reinforcement member (not shown).<br>
It is believed that the reinforcement member 110 illustrated in Fig. 5a provides<br>
optimal strength with minimal metal weight.<br>
Another embodiment is depicted in the partially cutaway, partially cross-sectional,<br>
end elevational view of Fig. 6a. In this embodiment, the reinforcement member 210 has a<br>
lower portion 212 having a cross-section in the shape of an inverted "L." The lower end of<br>
the web 214 of the "L" is secured to the surface of the tip plate T between adjacent rows of<br>
orifices, such as by welding (note welds W). The upper portion 220 of the reinforcement<br>
member 210 is also L-shaped in cross-section, as perhaps best understood with reference<br>
to the cross-sectional view of Fig. 6b. Thus, it too includes a web 222 that is secured to<br>
the transverse member 216 of the lower portion 212, such as by welding, to provide the<br>
resulting reinforcement member 210 with an F-shaped cross-section. This reinforcement<br>
member 210 is thus integrally formed with the tip plate T by welding the I-shaped<br>
member forming the lower portion 212 to the tip plate T, either before or after the L-<br>
shaped member forming the upper portion 220 has been welded to the lower portion 212.<br>
However, as noted above, it is of course possible, but more expensive, to create the entire<br>
reinforcement member 210 from a single piece of material having an F-shaped cross-<br>
section that is then welded directly to the tip plate T.<br>
Although not specifically illustrated, it should also be appreciated that to reduce the<br>
effects of sagging and extend the service life of the tip plate T, the upper portion 220 of the<br>
reinforcement member 210 has a variable height when viewed in profile, and thus defines<br>
at least one apex A. Indeed, in an embodiment of reinforcement member 210 where the<br>
height increases linearly from the sides to the midpoint, the actual side elevational view<br>
from the right side of Fig. 6b would be identical to one taken looking from the left or right<br>
side of Fig. 3a, with the observer's eye at or near the horizontal plane defined by the tip<br>
plate T. The view from the opposite, or left hand side of Fig. 6b would be similar to the<br>
view in Fig. 5a, but without the flange 126a or 126b shown along the top of the<br>
reinforcement member and with a partial or full length bead present where the web 222 of<br>
the upper portion 220 is welded directly to the upper surface of the transverse member 216<br>
of the lower portion 212.<br>
Still another possible embodiment is shown in Fig. 7a. In this embodiment, the<br>
entire reinforcement member 310, including the lower and upper portions 312, 320, is<br>
fabricated from a single piece of material, similar to one version of the embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 5a. However, in addition to flanges 326a, 326b, the member 310 also includes<br>
integral flanges 318a, 318b that add strengm and further help in resisting sagging. While<br>
this embodiment uses more material and is thus slightly heavier than the one shown in Fig.<br>
Sa (and also costs more to manufacture using current stamping or forging techniques), it<br>
reduces the amount of welding required as compared to the embodiment of Fig. 3 a, since<br>
welds are required only at the interface between the lower end of the web 314 and the<br>
surface of the tip plate T. Also, it may find utility in situations where the tip plate T is<br>
exceedingly wide, or others where a more substantial reinforcement is required.<br>
A similar embodiment of a reinforcement member 310 formed of a single piece of<br>
material having an L-shaped cross-section is shown in Fig. 7b. This reinforcement<br>
member 310 also has a variable height profile with an apex (not shown). When viewed<br>
from the right hand side of Fig. 7b, the view is similar to that of Fig. 5a (possibly without<br>
the optional openings 130).<br>
Up to this point, the reinforcement members 10,110,210,310 have been shown<br>
and described for use on a single, substantially planar tip plate T that extends between a<br>
pair of sidewalls in a bushing body (not shown). However, it is also possible to use the<br>
reinforcement members 10,110,210,310 in situations where a "double-bottomed"<br>
bushing is provided. This is illustrated in Figs. 8-10, with only one half of each "double-<br>
bottomed" bushing shown in Figs. 8 and 9 (note centerline L), and a full "double-<br>
bottomed" bushing shown in Fig. 10.<br>
In the first embodiment, the reinforcement member 410 has an upper portion 420<br>
similar to the others described above. The difference is that instead of an apex A formed<br>
by linearly increasing the height from the spaced ends, the height is varied non-linearly<br>
from each side so as to create an arcuate profile. Preferably, as with the other<br>
embodiments, the apex A is located substantially at the midpoint M between the ends of<br>
the reinforcement member 410 to provide the optimum resistance to bending stresses, and<br>
hence, time-induced plastic deformation (creep). In this embodiment, the apex A does not<br>
coincide with the midpoint between the sidewalls (only one sidewall S1 is shown in Fig.<br>
8), which may fall at or near the centerline L.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the embodiment of Fig. 8 may be formed like the<br>
one in Fig. 3a, with the upper portion 420 having the arcuate profile separately welded or<br>
attached to an upper surface defined by a transverse member 416 creating opposed flanges<br>
418a or 418b (only one shown in Fig. 8). The lower portion 412 is in turn secured to the<br>
surface of the tip plate T between adjacent rows of orifices O, and could possibly take the<br>
form of an existing gusset G, with the upper portion 420 merely serving as an add-on<br>
strengthening or reinforcement member. Both the end elevational and cross-sectional<br>
views of this embodiment are substantially the same as those in Figs. 4a and 4b, but could<br>
also be like those in Figs. 6a and 6b as well<br>
Alternatively, the reinforcement member 410 with the upper portion 420 having the<br>
arcuate profile may be fabricated from a single piece of material. Still another alternative<br>
is to form the upstanding portion or web 422 from a single piece of material, and then<br>
separately attach the curved transverse member 424, such as by welding. In any of these<br>
cases, both the upper and lower portions 412,420 may have T-shaped or L-shaped cross-<br>
sections (with both preferably having the same cross-sectional shape). Also, although not<br>
shown in Fig. 8, it should be appreciated that either portion may include weight-reducing<br>
apertures or openings.<br>
Still referencing Fig. 8, it is further noted that in the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
upper portion 420 stops short of the sidewall S1 as does the transverse member 416<br>
defining the flanges 418a or 418b (only one shown). The clearance thus created allows for<br>
the welder to gain access to the sidewall S1 so that a weld may be laid along the<br>
corresponding end of the web 414. This clearance is particularly helpful in the case where<br>
a plurality of closely spaced reinforcement members are provided (not shown).<br>
The embodiment shown in Fig. 9 includes a combination of features taken from the<br>
embodiments of Figs. 3a-4b, 5a, and 9. The upper portion 520 of the reinforcement<br>
member 510 has an inverted, V-shaped profile with an apex A, and is formed from a<br>
separate piece of material that is welded or otherwise secured to the transverse member<br>
516 of the lower portion 512 (both of which may have a T-shaped or L-shaped cross-<br>
section). A plurality of relatively small, strategically positioned openings 530 are also<br>
provided in the upper portion 520, which as noted above decrease the weight of the<br>
resulting reinforcement member 510 without substantially compromising the strength.<br>
The upper portion 520 also creates a gap with the sidewall S1. As noted in the previous<br>
paragraph, this is optionally done to provide access to the interface between the end of the<br>
lower portion 512 and the sidewall S1.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 10, the first noteworthy point is that the full<br>
"double bottom" bushing B or bushing assembly is shown in cross-section, including the<br>
spaced sidewalls S1, S2 and the tip plate(s) T. In the illustrated embodiment, the tip plates<br>
T are integrally connected with an inverted V-shaped channel C. This channel C extends<br>
along the length of the bushing B to provide enhanced structural support, and may be filled<br>
with a refractory material R to insulate against heat losses to a water cooled support (not<br>
shown). As is known in the art, the refractory material R usually also surrounds the entire<br>
bushing B to not only thermally insulate it from the ambient environment, but also<br>
electrically insulate it from other structures.<br>
Secured to the surface of each tip plate T is a reinforcement member 610. The<br>
reinforcement member 610 includes a lower portion 612, which as noted above may be<br>
formed by the gussets having a T-shaped or L-shaped cross-section already present on the<br>
tip plate T. The upper portion 620 in this embodiment has a profile that varies in height to<br>
define two apexes A1, A2, one positioned substantially at the midpoint of each tip plate T.<br>
Thus, the profile of the upper portion 620 has the shape of an inverted W. The upper<br>
portion 620 may be formed of a single piece of material, including a continuous web 622,<br>
or may have one or more transverse members 624 (two shown in Fig. 10) that are<br>
separately welded in place. Alternatively, both the lower and upper portions 612,620<br>
may be formed from a single piece of material, along with the transverse member 624<br>
defining at least one, and preferably a pair of opposed flanges. The upper portion 620 is<br>
also shown as having ends that are spaced from the sidewalls S1, S2 to permit access<br>
during welding, but as described above, this is optional.<br>
The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the present invention are presented<br>
for purposes of illustration and description. These descriptions are not intended to be<br>
exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications<br>
or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, while only a single<br>
reinforcement member or pair of reinforcement members are shown in the various<br>
drawings, it should be appreciated that any number required to provide the desired degree<br>
of reinforcement/resistance may be used at any spaced interval along the tip plate. Also,<br>
the reinforcement members, whether formed from a single piece of material, multiple<br>
pieces of material, or as add-ons to existing gussets, may be placed only at locations<br>
susceptible to the maximum bending stresses, with other locations either having the<br>
conventional gussets or no reinforcement Infinite variations on the shapes of the profiles<br>
or cross-sectional shapes of the various reinforcement members or components thereof<br>
may also be made, while still possibly achieving an acceptable level of<br>
reinforcement/resistance. For example, while T-shaped, F-shaped, and inverted L-shaped<br>
cross-sections create a minimal point of contact with the tip plate and minimize the added<br>
weight, the reinforcement member could have a C-shaped, I-shaped, or E-shaped cross-<br>
section as well, or any variation thereof. The embodiments described were chosen to<br>
provide the best illustration of the principles of the invention and its practical application<br>
to thereby enable one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the invention in various<br>
embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use<br>
contemplated. All such modifications and variations are within the scope of the invention<br>
as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to<br>
