				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This present invention relates in general to the field of MFP (Multi Functional Peripheral). Further this invention relates to image conversion. More particularly, the present relates to a method for converting non-image attachments to image attachments in email.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
A US Patent Number 6,618,160 discloses a System (Facsimile Apparatus) capable of automatically fetch e-mail from mail server and output it to print the data on a printing device. However the method for handling and printing non- image attachments in the e-mail has not been identified in the Patent.<br>
A facsimile apparatus capable of automatically preventing image data transmitted from a specific sender is provided. When a polling time comes which is set to access a mail server in order to fetch e-mail, a CPU of the facsimile apparatus accesses the mail server. After detecting the connection to the mail server, the CPU receives e-mail from the mail server. The CPU then analyzes the character codes contained at the position of the sender name in the e-mail. If it is determined that a predetermined character code is contained, the CPU performs the reverse format conversion of the image data attached to the e-mail, expands the image data, and outputs an instruction to print the image data. Steps:<br>
1)	Receive a mail.<br>
2)	Print the image data.<br>
The following are the limitations to the prior art:<br>
The method for handling non-image attachments in the e-mail has not been identified. <br>
The method of converting non-image attachments to corresponding image attachments by taking a series of screenshots of the attachments has not been specifically identified.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP in which the MFP can be configured to receive and automatically print the received mails. This also explains a method where in the user can denote that the mails will be sent to MFP while sending the mails.<br>
Accordingly the invention explains a method for converting non-image attachments to image attachments in email comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	configuring the MFP to receive mails;<br>
(b)	configuring the MFP to print the mails when it receives mails;<br>
(c)	creating the mail id for the MFP in the server;<br>
(d)	configuring the mail server to print the mail directly to MFP when it is delivered;<br>
(e)	pre-loading the MFP with the printable file format;<br>
(f)	checking the type of attachment before printing by the MFP;<br>
(g)	converting any non image attachments into an image document by taking a number of series of screen shots;<br>
(h)	attaching the image created and sending the mail to the MFP; and<br>
(i)	downloading the images directly and printing the images by the MFP on reception of the mail.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 shows the diagram of the present setup for converting non-image attachments to image attachments.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
This invention relates to the field of MFP in which the MFP can be configured to receive and automatically print the received mails. This also explains a method where in the user can denote that the mails will be sent to MFP while sending the mails.<br>
Figure 1 shows the diagram of the present setup for converting non-image attachments to image attachments. According to the figure 1:<br>
Application Server: Runs a host of application for opening the attachment with the respective application and creates a screen shots to create an image data and sends back to MFP for printing.<br>
Mail Server: SMTP server or POP3 server. (Eg: yahoo mail server). <br>
Network: Any standard network for data transmission.<br>
This is to have auto configure MFP to receive mails and print the same when it<br>
receives mails. This also is to convert non-image attachments to image<br>
attachments and filters the attachments based on attachment type.<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
Steps: Configuring Mail ID<br>
1)	A mail id is created for the MFP with respect to the server. (Eg<br>
<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2b464d6f6b43445f464a424705484446">[email&#160;protected]</a>).<br>
2)	The mail Id and password details, and the mail server details are<br>
configured to the MFP.<br>
3)	The above can be done for various mails id according to users of the<br>
MFP.<br>
Steps: Sending Mails to MFP<br>
1)	User can check in a check box that is provided by the Mail server denoting that a copy of the mail will be printed directly on MFP when it is delivered. It also checks on the types of attachments that can be printed. The MFP can be pre-loaded with the printable file formats. For example, attachments like mp3 file format for which printing can not be done will not be allowed to attach if check-box is checked.<br>
2)	There can be either a client side application or a pulg in a browser which can convert any attachments into an image document by taking a number of series of screen shots of the same.<br>
3)	Then it also attaches the image created and sends the mail.<br>
4)	On reception of the mail on MFP, it can download the images directly and print it.<br>
Steps: Receiving Mails<br>
1)	MFP can have an application which keeps checking for new mails for the configured mail id. For new mails, it checks if the mails have any attachment.<br>
2)	If the attachment is of any other type than image type supported by MFP, it requests the mail server from which the mail has come to send the<br>
attachment as series of image files.<br>
3)	On request mail server opens the attachment with the applications running inside the server and converts it as a series of image files by taking the individual screen shots of the opened document.<br>
4)	Then the MFP receives the image files sent by Server for the corresponding mail and prints it.<br>
5)	If there is no attachment MFP directly prints the email.<br>
One or more users can configure their mail id and gets their mails directly printed.<br>
