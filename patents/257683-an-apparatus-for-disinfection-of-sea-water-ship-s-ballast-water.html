				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus for disinfection of sea water / ship's ballast water and a method thereof The present invention particularly relates to an apparatus and method for disinfection of ship's ballast water, such as sea water, based on hydrodynamic cavitation This apparatus and method of the present invention for sea water treatment have particular utility in a ship to treat ship's ballast water that is being transported from one region to another The apparatus and method of the present invention may find other uses, such as making potable drinking water from contaminated water<br>
When a ship leaves a port empty, or partially loaded, it takes seawater into ballast tanks to maintain stability and adjust buoyancy In virtually every case, this ballast water will contain living organisms When the ship reaches its destination and prepares to load its cargo, it discharges this ballast water, thus introducing potentially invasive species to the aquatic environment of the destination port Approximately 70,000 cargo vessels carry billions of tons of ballast water around the world annually This introduces hundreds of marine invasive species to non-native environments This form of environmental pollution brings about ecological imbalance and causes indeterminate damages, estimated to be in billions of dollars<br>
To address this issue, many countries have passed regulations governing ballast water treatment and management The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted a convention for the control and management of ship's ballast water and sediments The IMO convention has set guidelines, pending ratification, for the quality of ballast water that can be discharged at any location A variety of options are under consideration for the treatment / disinfection of ballast water in maritime vessels The present invention specifically uses hvdrodynamic cavitation for ballast water treatment<br>
Cavitation is a phenomenon of formation, growth and collapse of micro bubbles within a liquid In hydrodynamic cavitation, the pressure variation in the flowing liquid causes cavitation The momentum balance equation predicts that when a<br>
fluid is made to pass through a constriction, the static pressure downstream drops due to an increase in liquid velocity If the pressure falls below a critical value, usually below the vapor pressure of the medium at operating temperature, then small bubbles or vapor cavities are formed in the fluid The condition at which these fine bubbles can be produced is termed as cavitation inception An increase in the velocity will resuh in a further drop m pressure and an increase in the cavitation intensity Generally, pressure recovery takes place further downstream where these cavities collapse generating a high magnitude pressure pulse If the gas content inside the cavity is small enough, the pressure impulse could be very high, of the order of several hundreds of bars, which is enough to rupture microbial cells causing its destruction Asymmetric collapse of cavities also results in very high speed liquid jets Shear rates around such jets is adequate to kill micro-organisms The present invention harnesses the phenomena of hydrodynamic cavitation using a novel apparatus and method to treat ballast water Such treatment limits the environmentally hazardous effects that may result from current practices<br>
The use of water treatment apparatuses and methods are known m the prior art For example, US Patent 6,840,983 to McNulty describes a system and method of water treatment using a venturi injector for removal of dissolved oxygen from water However, the focus is more on oxygen removal for corrosion inhibition and less on removing micro-organisms The disclosed system is not effective for killing the micro-organisms in the ballast water to the desired level<br>
Reference may be made to US patent no 6,835,307 and Australian patent no 6497400, which describe thermal treatment for ballast water The treatment does not use cavitation or chemicals for treating ballast water The system is not effective for killing the micro-organisms in the ballast water to the desired level<br>
Another reference may be made to US patent no 6,773,607, wherein is described systems and  methods  for annihilating non-mdigenous  marine  species and<br>
pathogenic bacteria in ship ballast water These methods rely on adding a killing agent which needs to be stored on board However, chemical disinfection techniques suffer from disadvantages like formation of possibly carcinogenic byproducts<br>
Reference may be made to a similar US patent no 6,773,611, in which apparatuses and methods of a ballast water treatment system are disclosed which includes a control system and a ballast tank system This method is also based on adding biocides for treating ballast water and therefore requires production and storage of hazardous chemicals on board besides generating undesirable byproducts<br>
A ballast water treatment based on ultra sound cavitation is disclosed m the US patent 6,770,248   The treatment requires  piezoelectric  rings  immersed  m pressurized transmission medium Besides these requirements, the penetration of ultrasonic cavitation is small and its performance deteriorates with the scale-up The method fails to use more effective hydrodynamic cavitation<br>
Reference may also be made to US patent 6,761,123, which discloses a method for killing of aquatic nuisance species (ANS) in ship's ballast water by permeating to equilibrium a gaseous mixture The method is time consuming and requires a vacuum over a long period (few days) This severely limits its utility for treating ballast water on ships<br>
A further reference may be drawn to US patents, Nos 6,516,738, 6125778, 20020066399 Al and 20030015481 Al and PCT patent no WO0210076, which describe methods for ballast water treatment using Ozone The systems require generation and storage of Ozone on board The systems do not use cavitation The methods do not allow ballast water treatment without the occurrence of chemical reactions<br>
In US patent nos 6,500,345, 2003029811 and 20050016933, PCT patent nos WO2004002895 A2, WO02072478 A2 and WO0244089 A2, are described apparatuses and methods for treating ballast water using UV or chemical biocides or killing agents Efficiency of UV based system degrades with scale of operation The use of chemical biocides is undesirable due to hazards in storage and formation of by-products The method does not allow ballast water treatment without the occurrence of chemical reaction<br>
A European patent EP1517860 and an US patent 2004055966 describe methods that involve filtration of water through membrane filter followed by UV radiation, which has certain limitations in achieving the required efficiency m eliminating organisms as well as filtration rate<br>
In US patent nos 6,284,793, 2004129645, 2004099608 and 2005016933 Al and a PCT patent no WO2005061388, are described methods, that are based on chemical treatment In this method, the organisms are destroyed by the addition of per carboxylic acid, hydrogen peroxide, ionization gases, chlorine dioxide and cyanide The method relies on several toxic and hazardous chemicals The method does not allow ballast water treatment without the occurrence of chemical reaction<br>
Reference may be made to US patent 6,171,508, which describes a method and apparatus for treating ship ballast water based on oxygenations and de-oxygenation Oxygenation and de-oxygenation steps are based on mass transfer equipment and are significantly more time consuming and expensive<br>
In US patent 5,816,181 ballast water treatment using heating is disclosed The method is based on use of multiple heat exchangers Such heat exchangers require significant space and the disinfection using heating is rather expensive The efficacy of the heat treatment is not as high as other methods of disinfection based on chemical biocides or hydrodynamic cavitation<br>
U S Patent 5,192,451 discloses a method for controlling zebra mussels m ship ballast tanks by adding a water-soluble dialkyl diallyl quaternary ammonium polymer However, the method does not allow ballast water treatment without the occurrence of chemical reaction and does not use hydrodynamic cavitation<br>
Besides the abovementioned patents, several studies on ultrasonic and hydrodynamic cavitation have been published m scientific journals, such as for example, Moholkar and Pandit, 1997, Gogate and Pandit, 2001 and references cited therein The focus of these studies was mainly on developing basic understanding of cavitation phenomena and to explore new applications of cavitation None of these studies however dealt with use of hydrodynamic cavitation for disinfection of ballast water<br>

In figure-1 of the drawings is illustrated the basic flow diagram of the apparatus for disinfection of sea water / ship's ballast water and a method thereof of the present invention using hydrodynamic cavitation which allows a ship to treat water that is being transported from one port to another while ballasting and de-ballasting More particularly, the system for ballast water treatment using a cavitation chamber (5) has water intake means (17) through which sea water enters from outside a vessel The water is then pumped through a pump means, such as, but not limited to a ballast pump (18), into an inlet port on cavitation chamber (5) optionally through heat exchanger (4) The exhaust gases from the ships engine are used in this heat exchanger to manipulate the temperature of the ballast water entering the cavitation chamber (5) The cavitation chamber comprises a single or multiple cavitating elements comprising a single or multiple orifices The shape of the orifices can either be circular or non-circular and either with or without sharp edges The treated ballast water is pumped from the cavitation chamber (5) to the ship's ballast tank (8) A quality control check can be performed prior to the receptacle (8) with appropriate method to monitor the quality of the treated water If necessary, the water or a portion thereof in the receptacle (8) may be re-circulated with the help of deballasting pump (9), through the cavitation chamber (12), and back into the receptacle (8) by diverting the flow with valves (7 &amp; 14) as preferably but optionally determined by and/or controlled by the quality monitoring system It should be noted that the method<br>
and the apparatus represented in figure-1 could be located on a ship or any seafaring liner<br>
Figure-2 represents a drawing showing cross section of cavitatmg chamber (item no 5 &amp; 12 in fig 1 and item E in fig 6) with details of arrangement of cavitating elements and inline connecting flanges The cavitating chamber of circular, rectangular or of any other cross section shape comprises of a single or multiple cavitating elements (2) in the form of plates of metallic, ceramic or plastic materials of varying thicknesses placed perpendicular to the direction of flow of fluid and positioned at uniform or non-uniform spacing in the range of 4 to 100 times the holding chamber diameter The cavitating elements are mounted and held in place by means of an appropriate mechanical holding device such as flanges (1) The cavitating elements (2) are provided with single or multiple orifices of different cross sections, such as circular, triangular, square or rectangular shape with or without sharp edges and with a fraction of cross-sectional open area of the passage The orifices may be circular or non-circular as stated above with each hole having diameter m the range of 500 micrometers to few millimeters The assembly of these cavitating elements is housed m a chamber which is having either circular or non circular cross section with appropriate flanges (1) as shown in figure 2 on intake and discharge ends to be housed in line<br>
In figure-3 of the drawings is depicted examples of cavitation elements As shown, percentage open area, number of orifices, distribution of locations of orifices and the shape and size of orifices are the key design and operating parameters The cavitation chamber comprises a single or multiple cavitating elements comprising a single or multiple orifices The shape of the orifices can either be circular or non-circular and either with or without sharp edges<br>
In figure-4 of the drawings is shown a flow chart of a procedure for designing a method and apparatus for meeting the ballast water treatment targets for any capacity    The   method   proposed   m   this   invention   involves   solution   of<br>
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based models and Rayleigh-Plesset equation for cavitation collapse for identifying preferably but not limited to (i) diameter of cavitation chamber, (ii) number of cavitation elements, (in) spacing between cavitation elements, (iv) fractional open area and number, diameter and distribution of orifices on each cavitation element, (v) operating temperature, (vi) operating flow rate, (vii) number of re-circulations through cavitation chamber It should be noted that for ensuring the desired overall disinfection effectiveness, it is essential to design a system which generates right number of cavitation events of adequate intensity The number of cavitation events is dependent on perimeter of cavitation elements The intensity of cavitation events depend on percentage open area or in other words on pressure drop across cavitating elements It should be noted that different micro-organisms would require different number density and intensity of cavitation events Different cavitating elements can be fruitfully used in series or m parallel to optimize the overall system<br>
The overall methodology for design of desired sea water dis-infector is shown in Figure 4 The methodology used for identification of the optimum operating parameters involves identification of type of microorganisms and estimating required intensity / number of cavitation events The Rayleigh-Plesset equation is used to simulate cavity dynamics and to quantify collapse of cavities and resulting disinfection performance Cavitation number (Cv) is an important parameter in hydrodynamic cavitation which decides the conditions for the onset of cavitation in a particular system It can be expressed as<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
where p2 is recovery pressure, pv is the vapor pressure of liquid, V0 is average velocity of liquid at the orifice and pi is the density of liquid  Under ideal conditions, cavitation preferably occurs for Cv    1 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based models are used to simulate flow and<br>
to predict the instantaneous pressure field around the traveling cavity at any downstream location<br>
The CFD models involve solution of conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy on a digital computer for a specific design/ configuration The more detailed flow chart of 4* box in figure-4 is shown in figure-7, wherein is given the methodology of applying CFD for optimizing design of dis-infector The first step in CFD modeling is to model specific geometry of cavitation chamber/ elements and generate grids for further computations The next step is to select appropriate governing equations for solving the flow in cavitation chamber/ elements The flows relevant to cavitation are invariably turbulent Several different models have been developed to simulate turbulent flows (see for example Ranade, 2002 and references cited therein) For simulating the flow through the cavitation chamber/ elements relevant to the present invention, we used the standard k-□ model to simulate turbulence The basic governing equations are as follows<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
These equations were solved using finite volume method and SIMPLE algorithm (Patankar, 1972) using a commercial CFD solver, FLUENT (of Fluent Inc, USA) The geometry modeling was done using commercial software called GAMBIT (of Fluent Inc, USA) The computational model was evaluated to quantify errors associated with the numerical solution After establishing that these numerical errors are within acceptable limits, the model was used to simulate flow and pressure field in different configutations of cavitation chamber/ elements The simulated trajectories of cavities and pressure / velocity history along such trajectories were stored for subsequent calculations of Rayleigh-Plesset equation The fluctuating pressure field predicted by the CFD models is incorporated into a bubble dynamics equation to obtain the cavity radius history and the collapse pressures for a cavity of certain size, traveling with the fluid (see Pandit and Gogte, 2001, Ranade, 2002) Once the parameters for generating desired cavitation events are identified, CFD models are then used to optimize the overall configuration of cavitation chamber The methodology is usefiil to optimize the overall system to meet the IMO guidelines on ballast water treatment<br>
Figure-5 of the drawings shows a sample of results obtained using the methodology depicted in figure-4 Figure-5(a) shows predicted flow field for one of the embodiments of the method and apparatus proposed in this invention Figure-5(b) shows simulated trajectories of cavities which might be generated in this embodiment Figur-5(c) shows simulated dynamics and its eventual collapse of a single cavity Figure-5(d) shows predicted relative driving force for different cavitation elements for the same power dissipation per unit mass<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for disinfection of ship's ballast water, such as sea water, based on hydrodynamic cavitation The apparatus comprises a cavitating chamber of cross section such as circular or non circular shape housing a single or multiple cavitatmg element(s) in the form of plates of metallic, ceramic, plastic materials of varying thicknesses placed<br>

While an embodiment of the apparatus and method of water treatment of the present invention has been described m detail it should be apparent that modifications and variations thereto are possible, all of which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, the following procedure may be used<br>
The water pumping through the cavitation chamber gets disinfected due to hydrodynamic cavitation Whenever water passes through the cavitation chamber, cavities are generated due to the pressure fluctuations resulting fi"om the changes in the geometry encountered by the flow The generated cavities undergo various stages of the cavitation phenomena before violently collapsing, resulting in the release of large magnitudes of energy and highly reactive oxidizing species The oxidizing species and conditions of high temperature and pressure are considered responsible for the disinfection of the micro-organisms The quantum of the oxidizing species and the magnitude of temperature/pressure, hence the disinfection efficiency, is dependent on the geometric and operating conditions<br>
It should be noted that, the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention<br>
For example, any suitable cylindrical conduit made of a wide variety of metals, plastic, or other sturdy material may be used for the transfer piping means and/or re-circulation piping means described And, although the disinfection treatment of water using hydrodynamic cavitation preferably but optionally on vessels, has been described, it should be appreciated that the method and the apparatus of water treatment herein described may also be suitable for a wide variety of water treatment applications including but not limited to wastewater management, agricultural applications, pool and space applications, oil and gas applications, and various disinfectant applications Additionally, a wide variety of holds or tanks of many shapes and sizes, as well as an open body of water, also may be used instead of the basic receptacle or ballast tank described Furthermore, the method, configuration, size, shape and pressure and volume requirements may be adapted to conform to a wide variety of ships of a variety of shapes and sizes, and a closed recirculation system and method described may be transferable from one receptacle to another The invention may also be adapted for use with a wide variety of pumps, receptacles, cavitation elements or sources, pressure valves and other components that are required by the invention but already present in a vessel or other treatment location<br>
