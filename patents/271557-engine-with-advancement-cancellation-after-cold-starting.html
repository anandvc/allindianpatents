SPECIFICATION Title: ENGINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention concerns an engine and more<br>
specifically,  an engine able to promptly cancel its<br>
advancement after starting during a cold term.<br>
[0002]<br>
There is an example of the conventional engines which comprises an upstream interlocking portion near a crank shaft, interlockingly connected through a timer to a downstream interlocking portions as well as the present invention. This timer is provided with a temperature-sensing operation means. During a cold-starting term while the temperature-sensing operation means senses a temperature of a value less than a predetermined one, the downstream interlocking portion advances by an advancing operation of the timer based on an operation the temperature-sensing operation means makes upon sensing the temperature. During a warm term of the engine while the  temperature-sensing  operation  means  senses  a<br><br>
temperature of a value not less than the predetermined value, the advancement of the downstream interlocking portion is cancelled by an advancement-cancellation by an advancement-cancellation operation of the timer based on another operation the temperature-sensing operation means makes upon sensing the temperature.<br>
The  engine  of  this  kind  has  the  following advantages.<br>
When the engine starts during the cold term, the timer advances the downstream interlocking portion to enhance the starting ability. After the cold-starting, the timer cancels the advancement of the downstream interlocking portion in an attempt to reduce Nox and noise. [0003]<br>
However, in the case of the conventional engine, the temperature-sensing operation means senses merely the atmospheric  temperature  in  the  vicinity  thereof  to operate.  This entails problems. [0004]<br>
The conventional technique has the following problems.<br><problem> The advancement is canceled in delay after the cold-starting.<br>
The temperature-sensing means senses only the atmospheric temperature in the vicinity thereof to operate. Therefore, even if the engine has its temperature increased after the cold-starting, it takes much time for the increased temperature to be transmitted to the temperature-sensing operation means to delay the cancellation of the advancement after the cold-starting<br><br>
with the result of reducing the exhaust-gas property.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]<br>
The present invention has an object to provide an<br>
engine capable of solving the above-mentioned problems. Mores specifically, it aims at providing an engine able<br>
to promptly perform the advancement-cancellation after the cold-starting.<br>
[0007]<br>
The featuring matter of the Invention as set forth in Claim 1 is as follows.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 1, Figs. 2 (A) to 2 (C) or Figs. 8(A) and 8 (B), an engine comprises an upstream interlocking portion 1 near a crank shaft 49, interlockingly connected through a timer 20 to a downstream interlocking portion 2. This timer 20 is provided with a temperature-sensing operation means 7. During a cold-starting term while the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value less than a predetermined one, the downstream interlocking portion 2 is advanced by the advancing operation of the timer 20 based on an operation the temperature-sensing operation means 7 makes upon sensing the temperature. During an engine-warm term while the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value not less than the predetermined one, the advancement of the downstream interlocking portion 2 is cancelled by the advancement-cancellation operation of the timer 20 based on another operation the temperature-sensing operation<br><br>
means 7 makes upon sensing the temperature. In this engine, an oil pump 57 for an engine oil 56 is communicated with an oil-supply port 58. The engine oil is fed from the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20, thereby enabling the engine oil 56 in liquid state to be brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation means 7. [0008] (Invention of Claim 1)<br><effect> It is possible to cancel the advancement promptly after the cold-starting.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 1, Figs. 2(A) to 2(C) or Figs. 8(A) and 8(B), the engine oil 56 in liquid state is brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation means 7. Thus after the cold-starting, the engine oil 56, which has its temperature increased promptly within the engine, contacts with the temperature-sensing operation means 7 at the liquid state to thereby immediately transmit the increase of the engine's temperature to the temperature-sensing operation means 7 with the result of being able to canceling the advancement after the cold-starting without delay. This enhances the exhaust-gas property. [0009] (Invention of Claim 2)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that presented by the Invention as set forth in Claim 1.<br><effect> It is possible to cancel the advancement immediately after the cold-starting.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 or Fig. 8(A), the timer 20 is<br><br>
arranged within a gear case 76 and the oil-supply port 58 is provided within the gear case 76. Further, the engine oil 56 fed from the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20 is made to flow from the timer 20 into the gear case 76. Owing to this arrangement, the engine oil 56, which has its temperature increased immediately after the cold-starting within the engine, is splashed up by a gear within the gear case 76 to become oil mist that fills the interior area of the gear case 76 to thereby promptly increase the atmospheric temperature around the temperature-sensing operation means 7. This entails the possibility of promptly canceling the advancement after the cold-starting. [0010] (Invention of Claim 3)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that given by the Invention as defined by Claim 2.<br><effect> The timer can be arranged in a compact manner.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 1 or Fig. 8(A), an axial direction of a sleeve 2c is taken as a front and rear direction. The timer 20 and an upstream interlocking gear lb are arranged side by side in the front and rear direction and they are externally fitted onto the sleeve 2c as they are. This can arrange the timer in a compact manner. [0011] (Invention of Claim 4)<br>
It  offers  the  following  effect  besides  that presented by the Invention as set forth in claim 3.<br><br><effect> It is possible to dispose the timer in a compact manner.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1 or Fig. 8(A), the upstream interlocking gear lb has a front and a rear surfaces one of which is provided with a recess portion lc. This recess portion lc contains at least part of the timer 20. Therefore, the timer 20 can be arranged in a compact manner. [0012] (Invention of Claim 5)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that afforded by the Invention as set forth in any one of Claims 1 to 4.<br><effect> The timer can be made compact. As exemplified in Figs. 2(A) to 2(C) or Fig. 8(A), the temperature-sensing operation means 7 is formed from a shape-memory spring 8 and the timer 20 is composed of a cam-interlocking  portion  3e  and  an  eccentric  cam mechanism 4.  This construction can   make the timer 20 compact. [0013} (Invention of Claim 6)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that given by the Invention of Claim 3 or 4.<br><effect> It is possible to retain the accuracy of the timer at a high level.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2(A) to Fig. 2 (C), the engine oil 56 that is injected from the oil-supply port 58 into the sleeve 2c is flowed out of an oil flow-out port 2d and is<br><br>
fed to the timer 20, so that it is brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation mans 7.  Therefore, the engine oil 56 injected through the oil-supply port 58 does not vigorously collide against the timer 20 to result in being able to retain the accuracy of the timber 20 at a high level. [0014] (Invention of Claim 7)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that given by the Invention of Claim 6.<br><effect>  It is possible to maintain the accuracy of the timer at a high level.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 2(A), the engine oil 56 that is flowed out of the oil flow-out port 2d and is fed to the timer 20 is also supplied to between a centrifugal weight 3 and a guide plate 88. This arrangement can reduce the sliding resistance of the centrifugal weight 3 to the guide plate 88 with the result of being able to maintain the accuracy of the timer 20 at a high level. [0015] (Invention of Claim 8)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that presented by the Invention as set forth in any one of Claims 2 to 4, 6 and 7.<br><effect> The oil-supply port can be arranged easily.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the oil-supply port 58 is arranged in a wall of the gear case 76. This enables the oil-supply port 58 to avoid the interference with the gears within the gear case 7 6 with the result of being<br><br>
able to be easily arranged.<br>
[0016]<br>
(Invention of Claim 9)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that presented by the Invention of Claim 8.<br><effect> The oil-piping can be readily arranged. As exemplified in Fig.  1,  an engine's wall is provided on its outer side with an external piping 58a. This external piping 58a communicates an oil gallery 58c within a cylinder block 58b with the oil-supply port 58 of the gear case 76.  This allows the oil-piping to avoid the interference with the gears within the gear case 76 with  the  result  of  being  able  to  facilitate  the arrangement of the oil-piping. [0017] (Invention of Claim 10)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that afforded by the Invention as defined by any one of Claims 3, 4, and 6 to 8.<br><ef fect> The sleeve can be fixed in a compact manner.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2 (A) , in order to fix the sleeve 2c to a downstream interlocking rotary shaft 2b by means of a fastening member 2e, the fastening member 2e is accommodated in the sleeve 2c to result in the possibility of securing the sleeve 2c in a compact manner. [0018] (Invention as set forth in any one of Claims 11 to 14)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that afforded by the Invention as defined by any one of Claims<br><br>
1 to 10.<br><effect> It is possible to reduce the resistance of transmission from an advancing spring to a pair of centrifugal weights.<br>
As shown in Fig 3 (A) , the advancing spring 6 is interposed between a pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3 in a position concentric with the weight-return spring 5. This makes it possible for the spring force of the advancing spring 6 to directly push and widen the pair of centrifugal weights to an advancing position (Ac) for the cold-starting,    without    using    the    spring-force transmission means which changes the operation direction of the spring force of the advancing spring 6 such as a tapered  cam.    This  can  reduce  the  resistance  of transmission from the advancing spring 6 to the pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3 with the result of increasing the accuracy of advancement when starting the engine during the cold term.   Further,  it suffices if the advancing spring 6 and the temperature-sensing operation means  7  may be  small  and may produce  low output. Additionally, there is not caused the disadvantage of reducing the durability due to the wearing-of f of the transmission portion. [0019] <effect> The timer can be made compact.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 3(A), a shape memory spring 8 composed of a compression-coil spring is used for the temperature-sensing operation means 7. This shape-memory spring 8 and the advancing spring 6 are interposed between the pair of centrifugal weights  3,  3  in a<br><br>
position concentric with the weight-return spring 5. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 2(A), the timer 20 is small-sized.  This makes it sufficient even if each of the advancing spring 6 and the temperature-sensing operation means 7 is small and produces a low output.  In addition, the timer can be made compact. [0020] (Invention as set forth in any one of Claims 15 to 18)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that presented by the Invention as set forth in any one of Claims 1 to 14.<br><effect> It is possible to smoothly start the engine during the cold term and to improve the exhaust-gas property while the engine is warm.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 5(A), when starting the engine during the cold term, an upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction is confined to a first limiting position of advancement (LI) . While the engine is warm, the upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction is confined to a second limiting position of advancement (L2). The second limiting position of advancement (L2) is arranged so that the upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction is set lower to make an upper limit of a degree of advancement (9) lower when compared with the first limiting position of advancement (LI).  This offers the following advantages.<br>
When starting the engine during the cold term, the engine can be smoothly started by setting the upper limit<br><br>
of the degree of advancement (8) higher.  Besides, while<br>
the engine is warm,  the exhaust-gas property can be<br>
improved by setting the upper limit of the degree of<br>
advancement (8) lower.<br>
[0021]<br>
(Invention of Claim 19)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that<br>
given by the Invention as set forth in any one of Claims<br>
1 to 5.<br><effect> It is possible to more promptly cancel<br>
the advancement after the cold-starting.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 8(A), the temperature-sensing operation means 7 is arranged as it is disclosed between a pair of support portions 60b and 59b.   In<br>
consequence, the engine oil 56 fed from the oil-supply port 58 easily contacts with the temperature-sensing operation means 7 to thereby enhance the sensitivity of the temperature-sensing operation means 7 with the result of being able to more promptly cancel the advancement after the cold-starting.<br>
[0022]<br>
(Invention of Claim 20)<br>
It offers the following effect besides that given by the Invention as defined in Claim 19.<br><effect> A means for supplying the engine oil can be formed at a low cost.<br>
As exemplified in Fig. 8(A), an idle gear 69 has a pivot axis 70 provided with an oil-supply passage 71, which supplies the engine oil 56 to between the idle gear 69 and the pivot axis 70.  An extension passage 72 is<br><br>
conducted out of the oil-supply passage 71 at an end thereof. The end out of which the extension passage 72 is conducted serves as the oil-supply port 58 The oil engine 56 is injected through the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20. Therefore, the engine oil 56 can be supplied by using the oil-supply passage 71 of the existing idle gear 69 with the result of being able to form the supply means for the engine oil 56 at a low cost. [0023] (Invention of Claim 21)<br>
It offers the following effect in addition to that presented by the Invention of as set forth in Claim 20.<br><effect> The means for supplying the engine oil can be made inexpensively.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 8(B), a fall-out preventing plate 74 has a rear surface formed with a groove-like extension passage 72 extending along a leading-end surface 70a of the pivot axis 70 and has a peripheral edge opened to provide the oil-supply port 58. Consequently, the engine oil 56 can be supplied by utilizing the existing fall-out preventing plate 74, which entails the possibility of making the means for supplying the engine oil 56 inexpensively.<br>

MOST PEFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION [0025]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are explained based on the drawings. Figs 1 to 7 show an engine according to a first embodiment of the present invention and Figs. 8 to 11 show another engine in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In these embodiments, an explanation is given for an upright multi-cylinder diesel engine. [0026]<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is outlined as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, a cylinder block 58b has a<br><br>
crank case within which a crank shaft 4 9 spans.   A direction where the crank shaft 49 spans is taken as a front and rear direction and one of the direction is defined as *front' -  A gear case 76 is attached to a front portion of the cylinder block 58b.  The gear case 76 has a lateral portion projecting further laterally than a lateral wall of the cylinder block 58b to form a lateral projection 7 6a.  This lateral projection 7 6a has a rear surface to which a pump-containing case 78 is attached.  As shown in Fig. 1, a fuel-injection pump 79 is inserted into the pump-containing case 7 8 from above to  be  accommodated  in  the  pump-containing  case  78 substantially in its entirety.  The pump-containing case 7 8 accommodates a fuel-inj ection cam shaft 23 at its lower  portion.    The  fuel-injection  cam  shaft  23 interlockingly operates the fuel-injection pump 79 and arranges a timer 20 at its front end portion.  As shown in Fig. 7, the crank shaft 49 engages an idle gear 69 with which the fuel-injection cam gear 21 meshes. [0027]<br>
The timer is outlined as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig 2(A) to Fig. 2(C), a downstream interlocking portion 2 is interlockingly connected through the timer 20 to an upstream interlocking portion 1 near the crank shaft 49. The timer 20 is provided with a temperature-sensing operation means 7. During a cold-starting term while the temperature-sensing operation means senses a temperature of a value less than a predetermined one, the downstream interlocking portion 2 advances by an advancing operation of the timer 20 based<br><br>
on an operation the temperature-sensing operation means 7 makes upon sensing the temperature. During a warm term of the engine while the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value not less than the predetermined one, an advancement of the downstream interlocking portion 2 is cancelled by an advancement-cancellation operation of the timer 20 based on another operation the temperature-sensing operation means 7 makes upon sensing the temperature. [0028]<br>
The timer is devised as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an oil pump 57 for an engine oil 56 is communicated with an oil-supply port 58 through which the engine oil 56 within the engine is supplied through the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20, so that it is brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation means 7. The oil pump 57 sucks the engine oil 56 within an oil pan 56a and sends it under pressure to an oil gallery 58c within the cylinder block 58b to thereby circulate the engine oil 56 within the engine. [0029]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the timer 20 is arranged within the gear case 76 and the oil-supply port 58 is provided within the gear case 76, so that the engine oil 56 supplied from the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20 is flowed from the timer 20 into the gear case 76. [0030]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the upstream interlocking portion 1 is composed of an upstream interlocking gear lb and a rotary downstream portion 2 is formed from a sleeve<br><br>
2 c fixed to a rotary downstream interlocking shaft 2b. An axial direction of the sleeve 2c is taken as a front and rear direction. The timer 20 and the upstream Interlocking gear lb are arranged side by side in the front and rear direction, and are externally fitted onto :he sleeve 2c as they are. This upstream interlocking gear lb is a fuel-injection cam gear 21.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the upstream interlocking gear lb has a front and a rear surfaces one of which is provided with a recess portionic. This recess portion lc accommodates at least part of the timer 20. Concretely, the recess portion lc is formed in a front surface of the upstream interlocking gear lb and accommodates an eccentric cam mechanism 4 at a rear portion of the timer 20. [0031]<br>
As shown in Fig, 2 (A) to Fig. 2 (C) , the temperature-sensing operation means 7 is composed of a shape-memory spring 8 and the timer 20 is formed from a cam interlocking portion 3e and the eccentric cam mechanism 4. The eccentric cam mechanism 4 comprises disk cams 25 and 27 attached to a cam holder 59 and interlockingly connected through a cam interlocking portion 3e to the shape-memory spring 8. And it performs the advancing operation of the timer 20 and the advancement-cancellation operation thereof based on the extending and contracting deformation of the shape-memory spring 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2(A) to Fig. 2 (C), the oil-supply port 58 is arranged opposite to an interior area of the<br><br>
sleeve 2 c and the sleeve 2 c has a peripheral wall provided with an oil flow-out port 2d. The engine oil 56 is injected from the oil-supply port 58 into the sleeve 2c. The engine oil 56 is flowed out of the oil flow-out port 2d and is supplied to the timer 20 so as to be brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation means 7. [0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 (A) to Fig. 2 (C) , the timer 20 is composed of the cam interlocking portion 3e and the eccentric cam mechanism 4. The cam interlocking portion 3e comprises a pair of centrifugal weights 3 and 3, which are positioned along guide plates 88 and 88. The eccentric cam mechanism 4 comprises the disk cams 25 and 21 attached to the cam holder 59. These disk cams 25 and 27 are interlockingly connected through the cam interlocking portion 3e to the temperature-sensing operation means 7. In order to perform the advancing operation and the advancement-cancellation operation of the timer 20 based on the operation that the temperature-sensing operation means 7 makes upon sensing a temperature, the following arrangement is made.<br>
The engine oil 56 flowed out of the oil flow-out port 2d and fed to the timer 20 is also supplied to between the centrifugal weight 3 and the guide plate 88.<br>
As shown in Fig.  1,  an oil-supply port  8  is arranged in a wall of the gear case 76. [0033]<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an engine's wall is provided on its outer side with an external piping 58a, which<br><br>
communicates the oil gallery 58c within the cylinder block 58b with the oil-supply port 58 of the gear case 76.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2(A), in order to fix the sleeve 2c to the downstream interlocking rotary shaft 2b by a fastening member 2e, the sleeve 2c contains the fastening member 2e.<br>
[0034] The eccentric cam mechanism has the following structure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2(B), the cam holder 59 is opened to provide a pair of larger-diameter cam holes 24, 24, into which larger-diameter disk cams 25 are internally fitted. Each of the larger-diameter disk cams 25 is opened to provide a smaller-diameter cam hole 25a and a pin hole 25b. A smaller-diameter disk cam 27 is internally fitted into every smaller-diameter cam hole 25a. Each of the centrifugal weights 3 projects an output pin 3d which is internally fitted into the pin hole 25b. Each of the smaller-diameter disk cams 27 is opened to provide a pin hole 27a into which a pin 29 is internally fitted. As shown in Fig. 2 (A) , this pin 29 is internally fitted into the pin hole Id of the upstream interlocking portion 1. [0035]<br>
A degree of advancement is adjusted by the operation of the eccentric cam mechanism as follows.<br>
A force of unbalance between a centrifugal force of each of the centrifugal weights 3 and a biasing force of a weight-return spring 5 operates the respective centrifugal weights 3 to move them in a centrifugal direction.   This advances the downstream interlocking<br><br>
portion 2 with respect to the upstream interlocking portion 1 through the eccentric earn mechanism 4.  When the respective centrifugal weights 3 are moved in a centripetal  direction,  the  downstream  interlocking portion 2 is made to lag with respect to the upstream interlocking  portion  1  through  the  eccentric  cam mechanism 4.  Concretely, as shown in Fig. 2(B), when the respective  centrifugal  weights  3  are  moved  in  the centrifugal direction to displace the output pin 3d from each of the centrifugal weights 3 in the centrifugal direction, the larger-diameter disk 25 is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow 25c and the smaller-diameter disk 27 is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow 27b.  This widens a spacing between the output pin 3d and the pin 29, thereby shifting the output pin 3d toward a downstream side of a rotation direction la of the upstream interlocking portion 1 and the downstream interlocking portion 2 toward the downstream side of the rotation direction  la with  respect  to  the  upstream interlocking  portion  1.  Therefore,  the  downstream interlocking portion 2 advances with respect to the downstream interlocking portion 1.  When the respective centrifugal  weights  3  are moved  in the  centripetal direction to displace the output pin 3d from each of the centrifugal weights 3 in the centripetal direction, the larger-diameter  disk  25  is  rotated  in  a  direction opposite to the above-mentioned one as well as the smaller-diameter disk 27. Accordingly, the output pin 3d of the centrifugal weight 3 is shifted toward an upstream side  of the  rotation direction  la  of the upstream<br><br>
interlocking portion 1 and the downstream interlocking portion 2 is shifted toward the upstream side of the rotation direction  la with  respect  to  the  upstream interlocking portion 1, thereby allowing the downstream interlocking portion 2  to  lag with  respect  to the upstream interlocking portion 1.  Therefore, the engine rotates at an increased speed to increase the centrifugal force of each of the centrifugal weights 3.  Then the fuel-injection cam shaft 23 advances to accelerate the timing for fuel-injection.  On the other hand, when the engine rotates at a decreased speed to decrease the centrifugal force of each of the centrifugal weights 3, the fuel injection cam shaft 23 lags to delay the timing for fuel- injection. [0036]<br>
The structure for obtaining the advancement on starting an engine is as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 (A) , each of the centrifugal weights 3 is interlockingly connected to an advancing spring 6 composed of a compression-coil spring. This advancing spring 6 is interlockingly connected to the temperature-sensing operation means 7. As shown in Fig. 4 (A) , when starting the engine during a cold term, the advancing spring 6 is maintained extensible based on a state (contracted state) of the temperature-sensing operation means 7 in which the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature to operate. This advancing spring 6 exerts a spring force which pushes and widens the pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3 to an advancing position (Ac) for cold-starting the engine.  As<br><br>
shown in Fig. 4(B), while the engine is warm, the advancing spring 6 is held contracted based on another state (extensible state) of the temperature-sensing operation means 7 in which the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature to operate, so that the spring force of the advancing spring 6 does not act on the pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3. The warm term of the engine means a term during which the engine is in operation or the engine starts while it is warm. [0037]<br>
The   temperature-sensing   operation   means   is constructed as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3(A), the shape-memory spring 8 composed of a compression-coil spring is used for the temperature-sensing operation means 7. This shape-memory spring 8 and the advancing spring 6 are interposed between the pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3 in a position concentric with the weight-return spring 5, As for the shape-memory spring 8 to be used, it is made of a shape-memory alloy and has a property of contracting when the engine is started during the cold term and of extending while the engine is warm. [0038]<br>
The arrangement of the shape-memory spring and the like is outlined as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3 (A) , one of the paired centrifugal weights 3, 3 has an interior area formed with a spring-accommodating hole 3a which accommodates the weight-return spring 5 and the other of the paired centrifugal weights 3, 3 has an interior area provided<br><br>
with a spring-acconimodating hole 3a which accommodates the advancing spring 6 and the shape-memory spring 8. The shape-memory spring 8 and the advancing spring 6 are formed into a double structure where one of them is positioned inside and the other is arranged outside. [0039]<br>
The arrangement of the shape-memory spring and the like is recited in detail as follows.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4 (A) and 4 (B) , the spring-accommodating hole 3a of one centrifugal weight 3 which accommodates the advancing spring 6 has an inner bottom provided with a first spring seat 3b, on which the advancing spring 6 has its base end portion 12 seated. A transmission cylinder 9 is arranged concentrically within this advancing spring 6. The transmission cylinder 9 has a leading end portion near a leading end portion 13 of the advancing spring 6. A first spring retainer 10 is provided at this leading end portion of the transmission cylinder 9 outwardly. This first spring retainer 10 receives the leading end portion 13 of the advancing spring 6 and is brought into contact with a retainer-receiving surface 3c of the centrifugal weight 3 which accommodates the weight-return spring 5. [0040]<br>
An axis 14 is attached to the centrifugal weight 3 which accommodates the advancing spring 6. This axis 14 is arranged concentrically within the transmission cylinder 9 and is provided with a second spring seat 14a, on which the shape-memory spring 8 has its base end portion  15  seated.    This  shape-memory  spring  8  is<br><br>
arranged concentrically between the axis  14  and the transmission cylinder 9.  The transmission cylinder 9 has another  leading end portion close to a  leading end portion 16 of the shape-memory spring 8.  A second spring retainer 11 is provided at this another leading end portion of the transmission cylinder 9 inwardly.  This second  spring  retainer  11  receives  the  leading  end portion 16 of the shape-memory spring 8.  The aforesaid axis 14 is a guide axis to open and close the pair of centrifugal weights 3, 3 and is inserted into the spring-accommodating hole 3a which accommodates the weight-return spring 5.  This spring-accommodating hole 3a has an inner bottom provided with a third spring seat 3d, on which the weight-return spring 5 has its base end portion 5a seated.  This weight-return spring 5 is concentrically arranged outside the axis 14.  This axis 14 has a leading end provided with a third spring retainer 14b.   This third spring retainer 14b receives a leading end portion 5b of the weight-return spring 5.  The axis 14 has a base end portion provided with a washer 14c which is brought into contact with the centrifugal weight 3 on the side of the advancing spring 6 so as to prevent the axis 14 from being dismantled by the spring force of the weight-return spring 5. [0041]<br>
As shown in Fig. 4 (A) , when starting the engine during the cold term, the advancing spring 6 is maintained extensible based on the sate of the contracted shape-memory spring 8, in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate, and has its spring force<br><br>
act on the first spring seat 3b and the retainer-receiving surface 3c, thereby enabling the paired centrifugal weights 3, 3 to be pushed and widened to the advancing position (Ac) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 4(B), when starting the engine during the warm term, the advancing spring 6 is held contracted based on another state of the extended shape-memory spring 8, in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate, so that the spring force of the advancing spring 6 does not act on the first spring seat 3b and the retainer-receiving surface 3c. [0042]<br>
The structure for switching over an upper limit of the degree of the advancement is outlined as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3(E), a first limiting member of advancement 41 and a second limiting member of advancement 42 are interlockingly connected to the shape-memory spring 8 through an output means 39 and a limitation switch-over means 44 so that they can be switched over.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5(A) , when starting the engine during the cold term, the first limiting member of advancement 41 is arranged so that it can make limitation based on the state (contracted state) of the shape-memory spring 8, in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate, through the output means 39 and the limitation switch-over means 44. This first limiting member of advancement 41 confines an upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction to a first limiting position of advancement<br><br>
(LI) .<br>
As shown in Fig. 5(B), while the engine is warm, the second limiting member of advancement 42 is arranged so that it can make limitation based on another state (extensible state) of the shape-memory spring 8, in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate, through the output means 39 and the limitation switchover means 44. This second limiting member of advancement 4 2 confines the upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction to a second limiting position of advancement (L2) .<br>
The second limiting position of advancement (L2) lowers the upper limit of the movement of every centrifugal weight 3 in the centrifugal direction so as to make an upper limit of a degree of advancement (9) lower when compared with the first limiting position of advancement (LI).<br>
This second limiting position of advancement (L2) comes to be the advancing position (Ac) for cold-starting the engine. [0043]<br>
The structure for switching over the upper limit of the degree of advancement is described in detail as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3(E), a rotating plate 44a is utilized for an alternative switch-over means 44. The rotating plate 44a is provided at one lateral portion of the paired centrifugal weights 3, 3 and is made rotatable around a center line 18 of rotation of the downstream<br><br>
interlocking portion 2.<br>
The rotating plate 44a is opened to provided a first limiting hole of advancement 46 and a second limiting hole of advancement 47. The first and second limiting holes of advancement 46 and 47 are arranged side by side in a rotation direction of the centrifugal weight 3 and are communicated with each other to form a communication hole 45.<br>
The first limiting hole of advancement 46 has a peripheral edge portion on a centrifugal side, which forms the first limiting member of advancement 41 and the second limiting hole of advancement 47 has a peripheral edge portion on the centrifugal side, which forms the second limiting member of advancement 42. Each of the centrifugal weights 3, 3 projects an engaging projection 48 into the communication hole 45.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5(A), when starting the engine during the cold term, the rotating plate 44a is placed in a first rotating position based on the state (contracted state) of the shape-memory spring 8 in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate. The first limiting member of advancement 41 can receive the engaging projection 48.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5(B), while the engine is warm, the rotating plate 44a is placed in a second rotating position based on another state (extensible state) of the shape-memory spring 8 in which the shape-memory spring 8 senses a temperature to operate. The second limiting member of advancement 42 can receive the engaging projection 48.<br><br>
[0044]<br>
Other devices are as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2(A), while the rotating plate 44a is provided at one lateral portion of the paired centrifugal weights 3, 3, the eccentric cam mechanism 4 is arranged at the other lateral portion thereof.  A pin 28 passes through each of the centrifugal weights 3. This pin 28 has one end portion which serves as the engaging projection 48 and has the other end portion which serves as the output pin 3d extending from every centrifugal weight 3 to the eccentric cam mechanism 4. As shown in Fig. 3(F), an output pin 39a is employed for the output means 39 from the shape-memory spring 8.  The rotating plate 44 is opened to provide an engaging hole 38 with which the output pin 39a engages. The output pin 39a is attached to the first spring retainer 10. [0045]<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention has the following construction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the direction where the crank shaft spans is taken as the front and rear direction. One of the direction is determined as Afront' and the other is defines as Arear'. The gear case 7 6 is arranged at a rear portion of the cylinder block 58b. This gear case 7 6 accommodates a gear train 77. The gear case 76 has a lateral end portion projected further laterally from a lateral wall of the cylinder block 58b to provide a lateral projection 7 6a. The lateral projection 76a has a front surface to which a pump-containing case 78 is attached.   This pump-containing<br><br>
case 78 contains a fuel-injection pump 79.   A fuel-injection cam shaft 23 spans below the fuel-injection pump 7 9 within the pump-containing case 78.  This engine is equipped with the timer 20. [0046]<br>
The timer is outlined as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig 8(A), the downstream interlocking portion 2 is interlockingly connected through the timer 20 to the upstream interlocking portion 1 near the crank shaft 49.  The timer 20 is provided with the temperature-sensing operation means 7.  During the cold-starting term while the temperature-sensing operation means senses a temperature of a value less than a predetermined one (for example  less  than  0  degrees  C) ,  the  downstream interlocking portion 2 advances by an advancing operation of the timer 20 based on an operation the temperature-sensing  operation  means  7  makes  upon  sensing  the temperature.  During a warm-term of the engine while the temperature-sensing   operation   means   7   senses   a temperature of a value not less than the predetermined one  (for  example  not  less  than  0  degrees  C),  an advancement of the downstream interlocking portion 2 is cancelled by an advancement-cancellation operation of the timer 20 based on another operation the temperature-sensing  operation  means  7  makes  upon  sensing  the temperature.  Also in this second embodiment, the upper interlocking portion 1 is a fuel-injection cam gear 21 and the downstream interlocking portion is a sleeve 2c. [0047]<br>
The timer is devised as follows.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the oil pump 57 sends under pressure the engine oil 56 which is circulated within the engine. The oil pump 57 is communicated with the oil-supply port 58 through which the engine oil 56 is supplied to the timer 20, so that it is brought into contact with the temperature-sensing operation means 7. [0048]<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the timer 20 is arranged within the gear case 76 and the oil-supply port 58 is opened into the gear case 76, so that the engine oil 56 supplied from the oil-supply port 58 to the timer 20 is flowed into the gear case 76. The oil-supply port 58 is an oil-injection port through which the engine oil 56 is injected to the timer 20.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the upstream interlocking portion 1 is composed of an upstream interlocking gear lb and a rotary downstream portion 2 is formed from a sleeve 2c fixed to a rotary downstream interlocking shaft 2b. An axial direction of the sleeve 2c is taken as a front and rear direction. The timer 20 and the upstream interlocking gear lb are arranged side by side in the front and rear direction, and are externally fitted onto the sleeve 2c as they are.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 8(A), the upstream interlocking gear lb has a front and a rear surfaces one of which is provided with a recess portion lc. This recess portion lc accommodates at least part of the timer 20. Concretely, the recess portion lc is formed in a rear surface of the upstream interlocking gear lb and accommodates an eccentric cam mechanism 4 at a front<br><br>
portion of the timer 20. [0049]<br>
The timer has the following concrete structure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the timer 20 is composed of the eccentric cam mechanism 4.  The fuel-injection cam gear 21, a cam holder 59 and a cam driving plate 60 are attached as they are superposed one on another to a rear end portion 23a of a fuel-injection cam shat 23 in the mentioned order from the front.  As shown in Figs. 9(A) and 9(B), the cam holder 59 has a rear end surface 59a disclosed laterally of the cam driving plate 60.  A rear end surface 60a of the cam driving plate 60 and the rear end surface 59a of the cam holder 59 provides a pair of support portions 60b and 59b so as to project therefrom. The temperature-sensing operation means 7 is arranged between the pair of support portions 60b and 59b as it is exposed. The temperature-sensing operation means 7 is a push spring made of a shape-memory alloy, namely a shape-memory spring 8.  As shown in Figs. 9 (A) and 9 (B) , an extending and contracting rod 87 which spans between the paired support portion 60b and 59b is inserted into the temperature-sensing operation means 7 so as to prevent the temperature-sensing operation means 7 from falling down.  As illustrated in Figs. 9(A) and 9(C), the cam holder  59  has  the  rear  end  surface  59a  disclosed laterally of the cam driving plate 60.   The rear end surface 60a of the cam driving plate 60 and the rear end surface 59a of the cam holder 59 provides another pair of support portions 60c and 59c so as to project therefrom. A return spring 85 of a pull-spring type spans between<br><br>
another pair of support portions 60c and 59c- As shown in Fig. 8(A), the sleeve 2c is attached irrotatable to the rear end portion 23a of the fuel-injection cam shaft<br>
23.	The fuel-injection cam gear 21 and the cam driving<br>
plate 60 are attached rot at able to the sleeve 2 c while<br>
the cam holder 59 is attached irrotatable to the sleeve<br>
2c.<br>
[0050]<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the cam holder 59 is opened to provide a pair of circular larger-diameter cam holes<br>
24,	24, into which larger-diameter disk cams 25, 25 are<br>
rotatably internally fitted.  Each of the larger-diameter<br>
disk cams 25 is opened to provide a smaller-diameter cam<br>
hole 25a.  A smaller-diameter disk cam 27 is rotatably<br>
internally fitted into every smaller-diameter cam hole<br>
25a.  An input pin 65 is attached to each of the larger-<br>
diameter disk cams 25, 25.  The guide driving plate 60 is<br>
provided with guide holes 67, 67 into which the input<br>
pins 65,  65 are internally fitted.   Attached to the<br>
smaller-diameter disk cams 27, 27 are output pins 29, 29,<br>
which are internally fitted into the pin holes Id, Id of<br>
the fuel-injection cam gear 23.  The guide holes 67, 67<br>
are inclined with respect to a rotation direction of the<br>
cam driving plate 60.<br>
[0051]<br>
The timer performs the advancing operation and the advancement-cancellation operation as followed.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11(A), during the cold-starting, the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value less than a predetermined one and<br><br>
therefore  is  contracted.   The  cam driving plate  60 retains a position for the advancing operation by a spring force 8 5a of the return spring 8 5 and the input pins 65, 65 are positioned at the respective outward end portions of the guide holes 67, 67.  The timer 20 is in the state of the advancing operation.  After the cold-starting, the engine oil 56 , the temperature of which promptly increases, is injected to the timer 20, so that the temperature-increase of the engine is immediately transmitted to the temperature-sensing operation means 7, thereby enabling the temperature-sensing operation means 7 to sense a temperature of a value not less than the predetermined one.  Then, as shown in Fig. 11(B), the temperature-sensing operation means 7 extends, thereby allowing the cam driving plate 60 to come to a position for the advancement-cancellation against the spring force 85a of the return spring 85. As a result, the input pins 65,  65 are positioned at inward end positions of the guide  holes  67,  67  and the timer 20  comes  to  the advancement-cancellation state. [0052]<br>
The eccentric rotary cam mechanism operates as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11 (A) , in the case where the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value less than the predetermined one, the cam driving plate 60 rotates to push the input pins 65, 65 outwardly. In this case, as shown in Fig. 10, when the cam holder 59 is seen from the rear, the larger-diameter disk cams 25, 25 rotate in a clockwise direction<br><br>
while the smaller-diameter disk cams 27, 27 rotates in a counter-clockwise direction.  A phase of the input pins 65,  65 is shifted to a downstream side of a rotation direction 86 of the  fuel-injection cam shaft  23  to thereby advance the fuel-injection cam shaft 23.   As shown in Fig. 11(B), in the case where the temperature-sensing operation means 7 senses a temperature of a value not less than the predetermined one,  the cam driving plate 60 rotates to push the input pins 65, 65 inwardly. In this case, contrary to the case shown in Fig. 10, the larger-diameter disk cams 25, 25 rotate in the counterclockwise direction while the smaller-diameter disk cams 27, 27 rotate in the clockwise direction.  The phase of the input pins 65, 65 is shifted to an upstream side of the rotation direction 86 of the fuel-injection cam shaft 23 to cancel the advancement of the fuel-injection cam shaft 23. [0053]<br>
Other devices are as follows.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), a fuel-injection cam gear 21 engages with an idle gear 69. The idle gear 69 has a pivot axis 70 provided with an oil-supply passage 71 that supplies the engine oil 56 to between the idle gear 69 and the pivot axis 70. An extension passage 72 is conducted out of the oil-supply passage 71 at an end thereof. The end out of which the extension passage 72 is conducted serves as the oil-supply port 58, through which the engine oil 56 is injected to the timer 20. [0054]<br>
As shown in Fig. 8(A), the idle gear 69 is fitted<br><br>
onto the pivot axis 7 0. The pivot axis 7 0 has a leading end surface 70a to which a fall-out preventing plate 74 is attached- The fall-out preventing plate 7 4 inhibits the idle gear 69 from being dismantled. This fall-out preventing plate 74 has a rear surface formed with a groove-like extension passage 72 extending along the leading end surface 70a of the pivot axis 70- The fallout preventing plate 7 4 has a peripheral edge opened to provide the oil-supply port 58. The fall-out preventing plate 74 is attached to the pivot axis 70 by attaching bolts 88. Although the groove-like extension passage 72 is formed across the fall-out preventing plate 74 radially thereof for facilitating the working to thereby form oil-supply ports 58 at its opposite ends, only one of the oil-supply ports 58 on the side of the timer 20 is sufficient from the aspect of injecting the engine oil 56 to the timer 20.<br><br><br>
