SEVEN SPEED TRANSMISSIONS WITH ALL POSITIVE ROTATION COMPONENTS IN FORWARD SPEEDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to power transmissions having four planetary<br>
gear sets that are controlled by six torque-transmitting devices to provide seven forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Passenger vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an engine, a<br>
multi-speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed transmission<br>
increases the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the engine to operate<br>
through its torque range a number of times. The number of forward speed ratios that are<br>
available in the transmission determines the number of times the engine torque range is<br>
repeated. Early automatic transmissions had two speed ranges. This severely limited the<br>
overall speed range of the vehicle and therefore required a relatively large engine that<br>
could produce a wide speed and torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a<br>
specific fuel consumption point during cruising, other than the most efficient point.<br>
Therefore, manually-shifted (countershaft transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]	With the advent of three- and four-speed transmissions, the automatic<br>
shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the motoring public. These transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel economy of the vehicle. The increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size between ratios and therefore improves the shift quality of the transmission by making the ratio interchanges substantially imperceptible to the operator under normal vehicle acceleration.<br><br>
2<br>
[0004]	It has been suggested that the number of forward speed ratios be increased<br>
to six or more. Six-speed transmissions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,070,927 issued<br>
to Polak on January 31, 1978; and U.S. Patent No. 6,422,969 issued to Raghavan and<br>
Usoro onJuly23,2002.<br>
[0005]	Six-speed transmissions offer several advantages over four- and five-speed<br>
transmissions, including improved vehicle acceleration and improved fuel economy.<br>
While many trucks employ power transmissions having six or more forward speed ratios,<br>
passenger cars are still manufactured with three- and four-speed automatic transmissions<br>
and relatively few five- or six-speed devices due to the size and complexity of these<br>
transmissions.<br>
[00061	Seven-speed transmissions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,623,397<br>
issued to Raghavan, Bucknor and Usoro. Seven-speed transmissions provide further<br>
improvements in acceleration and fuel economy over six-speed transmissions. However,<br>
like the six-speed transmission discussed above, the development of seven-speed<br>
transmissions has been precluded because of complexity, size and cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	An improved seven speed transmission having four planetary gear sets<br>
controlled to provide seven forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios is provided. The various embodiments of the improved transmission have rotation in the same direction in all forward speeds for any internal components rotating. Because all forward range internal rotational speeds are of the same direction, counter rotating elements are eliminated, which ensures low component speeds. The elimination of counter rotating elements also improves clutch life and the reduced internal speeds should result in very low associated spin losses. The internal speeds achieved are compatible with very high engine speeds, e.g., engine speeds up to 8,000 revolutions per minutes (rpm). The very low internal speeds allow for reduced internal differential speeds which improves gear and bearing life. As described below, various embodiments of the<br><br>
3<br>
transmission provide for reduced clutch loading, i.e., reduced clutch torque, which is<br>
desirable for clutch-to-clutch type transmissions.<br>
[0008]	In one aspect of the invention, the transmission has four planetary gear<br>
sets, each of which includes a first, second and third member, which members may<br>
comprise a sun gear, a ring gear or a planet carrier assembly member.<br>
[0009]	In referring to the first, second, third and fourth gear sets in this<br>
description, and in the claims, these sets may be counted "first" to "fourth" in any order<br>
in the drawings (i.e., left to right, right to left, etc.). Additionally, the first, second or<br>
third members of each gear set may be counted "first" to "third" in any order in the<br>
drawings (i.e., top to bottom, bottom to top, etc.) for each gear set.<br>
[0010]	In another aspect of the invention, a first interconnecting member<br>
continuously interconnects a first member of the first planetary gear set with a first<br>
member of the second planetary gear set.<br>
[0011]	In yet a further aspect of the invention, a second interconnecting member<br>
continuously interconnects the first member of the third planetary gear set with a first<br>
member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0012]	In still a further aspect of the invention, a third interconnecting member<br>
continuously interconnects the second member of the third planetary gear set with the<br>
second member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0013]	In yet another aspect of the invention, each transmission incorporates, an<br>
input shaft which is continuously connected with a member of the planetary gear sets and<br>
an output shaft which is continuously connects with another member of the planetary<br>
gear sets. The input shaft may be continuously connected with the third member of the<br>
second planetary gear set and the output shaft may be continuously connected with the<br>
third member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0014]	In a further aspect of the invention, a first torque-transmitting mechanism,<br>
such as a stationary-type clutch or brake, is operable for selectively interconnecting the<br>
third member of the first planetary gear set with the stationary member. Alternatively,<br>
the first torque-transmitting mechanism may be operable for interconnecting the third<br><br>
4<br>
member of the first planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary gear<br>
set.<br>
[0015]	In still a further aspect of the invention, a second torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, such as a clutch, is operable for selectively interconnecting the first member<br>
of the first planetary gear set and the first member of the second planetary gear set with<br>
the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0016]	In still a further aspect of the invention, a third torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, such as a clutch, is operable for selectively interconnecting the third member<br>
of the second planetary gear set and the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0017]	In still a further aspect of the invention, a fourth torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, such as a clutch, is operable for selectively interconnecting the third member<br>
of the second planetary gear set with the first member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0018]	In still a further aspect of the invention, a fifth torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, such as a stationary-type clutch or brake, is operable for selectively<br>
interconnecting the first member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary<br>
member.<br>
[0019]	In another aspect of the invention, a sixth torque-transmitting mechanism,<br>
such as a stationary-type clutch or brake, is operable for selectively interconnecting the<br>
second member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary member.<br>
[0020]	Optionally, a seventh torque-transmitting mechanism may be provided to<br>
selectively interconnect a fourth interconnecting member with the stationary member.<br>
The fourth interconnecting member continuously interconnects the second member of the<br>
first planetary gear set with the third member of the fourth planetary gear set; therefore,<br>
these two members are held stationary by application of the seventh torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism. With the seventh torque-transmitting mechanism, eight forward speed ratios<br>
are achieved.	<br>
[0021]	In still a further aspect of the invention, forward ratio shifts are of the<br>
single transition type.<br><br>
5<br>
[0022]	In another aspect of the invention, one of the six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms selectively interconnects the input member with the first member of the third<br>
planetary gear set and another of the torque-transmitting mechanisms selectively<br>
interconnects the input member with the third member of the fourth planetary gear set.<br>
[0023]	In still another aspect of the invention, the first, second and third of the<br>
seven forward speed ratios are substantially equivalent in value with respective ones of<br>
the reverse speed ratios so that shifting may occur from the first, second and third<br>
forward speed ratios to the respective, substantially equivalent reverse speed ratios.<br>
[0024]	In still another aspect of the invention, one of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms selectively interconnects the first member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary member, and another of the torque-transmitting mechanisms selectively interconnects the second member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary member.<br>
[0025]	In yet another aspect of the invention, two to the six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms each selectively interconnect a respective member of one of the planetary gear sets with the stationary member. A first of the two torque-transmitting mechanisms is engaged only during selective ones of the seven forward speed ratios and a second of the torque-transmitting mechanisms is engaged only during the three reverse speed ratios. Thus, because one of the torque-transmitting mechanisms is used for reverse holding only, a static apply clutch design may be employed. The high torque associated with a static apply clutch design is not used in the forward shift sequence. The second grounding clutch is used in the forward shift sequence.<br>
[0026]	In yet another aspect of the invention, two of the six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms are stationary-type clutches and four of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms are rotation-type clutches. Alternatively, three of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms may be stationary-type clutches and three of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms may be rotating-type clutches.<br>
[0027]	In another aspect of the invention, the input shaft is continuously<br>
connected with the second planetary gear set and is selectively connectable with the third<br><br>
6<br>
and fourth planetary gear sets respectively via two of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms. Another one of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms is operable for selectively connecting the second planetary gear set with the fourth planetary gear set. Another two of the six torque-transmitting mechanisms are operable for selectively connecting a different respective member of the fourth planetary gear set with the stationary member and a final one of the torque-transmitting mechanisms is operable for selectively connecting the first planetary gear set with either the fourth planetary gear set or the stationary member. The output shaft is continuously connected with a member of the third planetary gear set.<br>
[0028]	In still another aspect of the invention, the six torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms are selectively engagable in combinations of two to yield seven forward<br>
speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios. Alternatively, if the optional seventh torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism is provided selectively connecting the third member of the fourth<br>
planetary gear set with the stationary member, the seven torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
are engagable in combinations of two to yield eight forward speed ratios and three<br>
reverse speed ratios.	&gt;<br>
[0029]	The resulting transmission offers a variety of ratio spread options with<br>
very low internal speeds and reduced clutch loading for clutch-to-clutch shifting.<br>
[0030]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0051] . The planetary gear set 40 includes a sun gear member 42, a ring gear member 44, and a planet carrier assembly member 46. The planet carrier assembly member 46 includes a plurality of pinion gears 47 rotatably mounted on the carrier member 49 and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear member 44.<br><br>
9<br>
[0052]	The planetary gear set 50 includes a sun gear member 52, a ring gear<br>
member 54, and a planet carrier assembly member 56. The planet carrier assembly member 56 includes a plurality of pinion gears 57 rotatably mounted on the carrier member 59 and disposed in meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 52 and the ring gear member 54.<br>

gear member 24 is continuously connected with carrier member 39 through the<br>
interconnecting member 70. The ring gear member 44 is continuously connected with<br>
the carrier member 59 through the interconnecting member 72. The sun gear member 42<br>
is continuously connected with the sun gear member 52 through the interconnecting<br>

54 through the clutch 60, which may also be referred to as the LL clutch. The ring gear<br>
member 24 is selectively connectable with the ring gear member 54 through the clutch<br>
62, which also may be referred to herein as the L clutch. The ring gear member 34 is<br>

stationary housing 80, thereby effectively connecting the ring gear member 54 with the<br>
stationary housing 80. The optional clutch 69 may be referred to herein as the C4 clutch.<br>
When the C4 clutch is present, eight forward speed ratios may be achieved.<br>
[0054]	As shown in Figure 2A, and in particular the truth table disclosed therein,<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanisms are selectively engaged in-combinations of two to<br><br>
10<br>
provide seven forward speed ratios (eight forward speed ratios if the C4 clutch 69 is<br>
present) and three reverse speed ratios. The torque-transmitting mechanisms 60, 62, 64,<br>
66, 67, 68 and 69 are preferably of the multiple disk-type, fluid actuated friction-drive<br>
establishing device which are commonly used in planetary gear transmissions.<br>
[0055]	The Reverse 2 speed ratio is established with the engagement of the C2<br>
clutch 64 and the C5 clutch 67. The C2 clutch 64 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 54, and the C5 clutch 67 connects the carrier member 59 with the transmission housing 80. The ring gear member 34 and the ring gear member 54 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The carrier member 59 and the ring gear member 44 do not rotate. The sun gear member 52 rotates at the same speed as the sun gear member 42. The sun gear member 52 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the Reverse 2 speed ratios is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear sets 40 and 50.<br>
[0056]	The Reverse 1 speed ratio is established with the engagement of the L<br>
clutch 62 and the C5 clutch 67. The L clutch 62 connects the ring gear member 24 with the ring gear member 54, and the C5 clutch 67 connects the carrier member 59 with the transmission housing 80. The ring gear member 34 rotates at the same speed at the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 and the ring gear member 24 rotate at the same speed as the ring gear member 54. The sun gear member 32 and the sun gear member 22 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the-speed of the ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The<br><br>
11<br>
carrier member 59 and the ring gear member 44 do not rotate. The sun gear member 52 rotates at the same speed as the sun gear member 42. The sun gear member 52 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40.

sets 30, 40 and 50.	<br>
[0057]	The Reverse Low speed ratio is established with the engagement of the LL<br>
clutch 60 and the C5 clutch 67. The LL clutch 60 connects the carrier member 29 with the ring gear member 54, and the C5 clutch 67 connects the carrier member 59 with the transmission housing 80. The ring gear member 34 rotates at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The carrier member 29 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 54. The carrier member 29 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier member 39 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 20. The carrier member 59 and the ring gear member 44 do not rotate. The sun gear member 52 rotates at the same speed as the sun gear member 42. The sun gear member 52 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the Reverse Low speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50.<br><br>

[0058]	The first forward speed ratio, which may also be referred to herein as<br>
Low, is established with the engagement of the LL clutch 60 and the C6 clutch 68. The<br>
LL clutch 60 connects the carrier member 29 with the ring gear member 54, and the C6<br>
clutch 68 connects the sun gear member 52 with the transmission housing 80. The ring<br>
gear member 34 rotates at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39<br>
rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32<br>
do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the<br>
ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30.<br>
The ring gear member 24 rotates at the same speed as the carrier member 39. The carrier<br>
member 29 rotates at a speed determined by the speed of the ring gear member 24 and the<br>
ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 20. The carrier member 59 rotates<br>
at the same speed as ring gear member 44. The sun gear members 42 and 52 do not<br>
rotate. The carrier member 59 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring<br>
gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The<br>
carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member<br>
49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the<br>
ring gear member 44 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40.<br>
The numerical value of the first (Low) forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring<br>
gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0059]	In a simple planetary gear set, when the sun gear member is held<br>
stationary and power is applied to the ring gear member of a simple planetary gear set, the planet gear members rotate in response to the power applied to the ring gear member and thus "walk" circumferentially about the fixed sun gear member to effect rotation of the carrier member in the same direction as the direction in which the ring gear member is being rotated.<br>
[0060]	When any two members of a simple planetary gear set rotate in the same<br>
direction and at the same speed, the third member is forced to turn at the same speed, and in the same direction. For example, when the sun gear member and the ring gear member rotate in the same direction, and at the same speed, the planet gear members do not rotate<br><br>
13<br>
about their own axes but rather act as wedges to lock the entire unit together to effect what is known as direct drive. That is, the carrier member rotates with the sun and ring gears.<br>
[0061]	However, when the two gear members rotate in the same direction, but at<br>
different speeds, the direction in which the third gear member rotates may often be determined simply by visual analysis, but in many situations the direction will not be obvious and can only be accurately determined by knowing the number of teeth present on all the gear members of the planetary gear set.<br>
[0062]	Whenever the carrier member is restrained from spinning freely, and<br>
power is applied to either the sun gear member or the ring gear member, the planet gear members act as idlers. In that way the driven member is rotated in the opposite direction as the drive member. Thus, in many transmission arrangements when the reverse drive range is selected, a torque transfer device, serving as a brake is actuated frictionally to engage the carrier member and thereby restrain it against rotation so that power applied to the sun gear member will turn the ring gear member in the opposite direction. Thus, if the ring gear member is operatively connected to the drive wheels of a vehicle, such an arrangement is capable of reversing the rotational direction of the drive wheels, and thereby reversing the direction of the vehicle itself.<br>
[0063]	In a simple set of planetary gear members, if any two rotational speeds of<br>
the sun gear member , the carrier member and the ring gear member are known, then the speed of the third member can be determined using a simple rule. The rotational speed of the carrier member is always proportional to the speeds of the sun gear member and the ring gear member, weighted by their respective numbers,of teeth. For example, a ring gear member may have twice as many teeth as the sun gear member in the same set. The speed of the carrier member is then the sum of two-thirds the speed of the ring gear member and one-third the speed of the sun gear member. If one of these three members rotates in an opposite direction, the arithmetic sign is negative for the speed of that member in mathematical calculations.<br><br>
14<br>
[0064]	The torque on the sun gear member, the carrier member and the ring gear<br>
member can also be simply related to one another if this is done without consideration of<br>
the masses of the gears, the acceleration of the gears, or friction within the gear set, all of<br>
which have a relatively minor influence in a well designed transmission. The torque<br>
applied to the sun gear member of a simple planetary gear set must balance the torque<br>
applied to the ring gear member, in proportion to the number of teeth on each of these<br>
gears. For example, the torque applied to a ring gear member with twice as many teeth as<br>
the sun gear member in that set must be twice that applied to the sun gear member, and<br>
must be applied in the same direction. The torque applied to the planet carrier assembly<br>
member must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the sum of the torque on<br>
the sun gear member and the torque on the ring gear member.	,<br>
[0065]	As will be well understood by those skilled in the art, members of the<br>
gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the first forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise; because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34. Because the carrier member 39 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member 22 is stationary, the ring gear member 24, the carrier member 29 and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 50, because the ring gear member 54 is connected with,the carrier member 29 via the LL clutch 60 and the C6<br><br>
)<br>
clutch 68 holds the sun gear member 52 stationary, the ring gear member 54, the carrier member 59 and the pinion gears 57 rotate in a clockwise direction. With respect to the planetary gear set 40, because the ring gear member 44 is continuously connected with the carrier member 59 and the sun gear member 42 does not rotate, the carrier member 49, the pinion gears 47 and also the output shaft 19 all rotate in the same clockwise direction as the carrier member 59.<br><br>
15<br>
[0066]	The second forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
L clutch 62 and the C6 clutch 68. The L clutch 62 connects the ring gear member 24<br>
with the ring gear member 54, and the C6 clutch 68 connects the sun gear member 52<br>
with the transmission housing 80. The ring gear member 34 rotates at the same speed as<br>
the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 and the ring gear member 24 rotate at the same<br>
speed as the ring gear member 54. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The<br>
carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member<br>
34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The carrier member<br>
59 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 44. The sun gear members 42 and<br>
52 do not rotate. The carrier member 59 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of<br>
the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set<br>
50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier<br>
member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the<br>
speed of the ring gear member 44 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary<br>
gear set 40. The numerical value of the second forward speed ratio is determined<br>
utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0067]	As with the first forward speed ratio, members of the gear sets 20, 30, 40<br>
and 50 rotating during the second forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 22 is held stationary, the carrier member i39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34. Because the carrier member 39 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member 22 is stationary, the ring gear member 24, the carrier member 29, and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 50, because the ring gear member 54 is connected with the ring gear member 24, via the L clutch 62 and the C6 clutch 68 holds the sun gear member 52 stationary, the ring gear member 54, carrier member 59 and the pinion gears 57 also rotate in a clockwise direction. With respect to planetary gear set 40, because the ring gear member 44 is continuously connected with the carrier member 59 and the sun<br><br>
16<br>
gear member 42 does not rotate; the ring gear member 44, the carrier member 49, the pinion gears 47 and also the output shaft 19 all rotate in the same clockwise direction as the carrier member 59.<br>
[0068]	The third forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the C2<br>
clutch 64 and the C6 clutch 68. The C2 clutch 64 connects the ring gear member 34 with<br>
the ring gear member 54, and the C6 clutch 68 connects the sun gear member 52 with the<br>
transmission housing 80. The ring gear member 34 and the ring gear member 54 rotate at<br>
the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 rotates at the same speed as<br>
the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier<br>
member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 34 and<br>
the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The carrier member 59<br>
rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 44. The sun gear members 42 and 52<br>
do not rotate. The carrier member 59 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the<br>
ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50.<br>
The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier<br>
member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the<br>
speed of the ring gear member 44 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary<br>
gear set 40. The numerical value of the third forward speed is determined utilizing the<br>
ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0069]	As will be understood by those skilled in the art, as with the first and<br>
second forward speed ratios, members of the gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the third forward speed ratio rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 3 9, and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34. Because the carrier member 39 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 24, and because the sun gear member 22 is stationary, the carrier member 29 and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 50, because the ring gear member 54 is connected with the ring gear.member 34 by the C2<br><br>
17<br>
clutch 64, and because the sun gear member 52 is held stationary by the C6 clutch 68, carrier member 39 and pinion gears 37 rotate in a clockwise direction. With respect to planetary gear set 40, because the ring gear member 44 is continuously connected with carrier member 59, and the sun gear member 42 does not rotate, the carrier member 49, the pinion gears 47 and also the output shaft 19 all rotate in the same clockwise direction as the carrier member 59.<br>
[0070]	The fourth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
C3 clutch 66 and the C6 clutch 68. The C3 clutch 66 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 44, and the C6 clutch 68 connects the sun gear member 52 with the transmission housing 80. The ring gear member.34, the ring gear member 44 and the carrier member 59 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The sun gear members 42 and 52 do not rotate. . The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member44 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the fourth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30 and 40.<br>
[0071]	As will be understood by those skilled in the art, members of the gear sets<br>
20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the fourth forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34.' Because the carrier member 39 is connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member 22 is held stationary, the ring gear member 24, the carrier member 29 and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 40, because the ring gear member 44 is<br><br>
18<br>
connected with the ring gear member 34 via the C3 clutch 66 and the sun gear member<br>
42 is stationary, the carrier member 49 and the output shaft 19, as well as the <br>
pinion gears 47 rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 50,<br>
because the carrier member 59"is contiriuousiy'connected with the ring gear member 44,<br>
and because the sun gear member52 is held stationary by the	the carrier<br>
member 59, the pinion gears 57 and ring gear member 54 all rotate in a clockwise<br>
direction	<br>
[0072]	The fifth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the C2<br>
clutch 64 and the C3 clutch 66. TheC2 clutch 64 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 54, and the C3<br>
ring gear member 44. In this configuration, because all of the members of the planetary gear sets"40 and 50 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17 the output shaft 19 also<br>
rotates at the same speed as the input shaft 17such that the numerical value of the fifth forward speed ratio is 1.<br>
[0073]	As will beuriderstoW'b"y <br>
the transmission 14 rotating during the fifth forward speed ratio all rotate in the same<br>
direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and<br>

32 is held stationary the carrier member 39 Vnd*tne piniongears'37'rotate in the sanie<br>

19<br>
[0074]	The sixth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the L<br>
clutch 62 and the C3 clutch 66. The L clutch 62 connects the ring gear member 24 with the ring gear member 54, the C3 clutch 66 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 44. The ring gear member.34, the ring gear member ,44,and the carrier member 59 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 and the ring gear member 24 rotate at the same speed as the ring gear member 54. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The sun gear member 52 rotates at the same speed as the sun gear member 42. The sun gear member 52 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier member 59, the speed of the ring gear member 54 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 44, the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the sixth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0075]	As will be understood by those skilled in the art, members of the gear sets<br>
20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the sixth forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34. Because the carrier member 39 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member 22 is held stationary, the ring gear member 24, the carrier member,29 and the pinionxgears.27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 50, because the ring gear member 54 is connected with the ring gear member 24 via the L clutch 62, and the ring gear member 54 rotates in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 40, because the C3 clutch 66 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 44, the<br><br>
20<br>
ring gear member 44 also rotates in a clockwise direction. Because the ring gear member<br>
44 is continuously connected with the carrier member 59, the carrier member 59 also<br>
rotates in a clockwise direction. The sun gear members 42 and 52 are continuously<br>
connected and therefore rotate in the same direction. The tooth counts of the elements of<br>
the planetary gear sets 40 and 50 are chosen so that the sun gear members 42 and 52, the<br>
pinion gears 47 and 57 as well as the carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft<br>
19, also all rotate in a clockwise direction. For instance, the speed ratios shown in the<br>
truth table in Figure 2A reflect the planetary gear set 40 having a ring gear member 44<br>
with 81 teeth, a carrier member 49 with 30 teeth and a sun gear member 42 with 21 teeth,<br>
a ring gear member 54 with 81 teeth, and a sun gear member 52 with 28 teeth.<br>
Additionally, as will be discussed below with respect to the truth table of Figure 3 A, the<br>
ring gear member 44 may have 81 teeth, the sun gear member 42 may have 26 teeth, the<br>
ring gear member 54 may have 81 teeth, and the sun gear member 52 may have 37 tepth<br>
in order to achieve the unidirectional clockwise rotation in planetary gear sets 40 and 50.<br>
Finally, with respect to the truth table of Figure 4A, discussed below, the same tooth<br>
counts as shown above with respect to the truth table of Figure 3A will result in all<br>
clockwise rotation in the planetary gear sets 40 and 50. <br>
[0076]	The seventh forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the<br>
LL clutch 60 and the C3 clutch 66. 
 <br>
21<br>
54 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier member 59, the speed of the sun gear member 52 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 44, the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the seventh forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 20, 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0077]	As will be understood by those skilled in the art, members of the gear sets<br>
20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the seventh forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member "34. Because the carrier member 39 is continuously connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member is held stationary, the ring gear member 24, the carrier member 29 and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear sets 40 and 50, because the carrier member 29 is connected with the ring gear member 54 via the LL clutch 60, the ring gear member 54 rotates in a clockwise direction. Because the ring gear member 44 is<br>
1 ¦ • :i connected with the ring gear member 34 via the C3 clutch 66, and because the ring gear<br>
member 44 is continuously connected with the carrier member 59, the ring gear member 44 and the carrier member 59 also rotate in clockwise direction. The sun gear members 42 and 52 are continuously connected and therefore must rotate in the same direction. The tooth counts of the elements of the planetary gear sets 40 and 50 are chosen so that the sun gear members 42 and 52, the pinion gears 47 and 57 as well as the carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, also all rotate in a clockwise direction. The tooth counts described above with respect to the discussion of the sixth forward speed ratio for the truth tables in Figures 2A, 3A and 4A will result in such unidirectional rotation.<br><br>
22<br>
[0078]	When the optional C4 clutch 69 is present to connect the ring gear<br>
member 54 with the stationary housing 80, an eighth forward speed ratio may be established. The eighth forward speed ratio is established with the engagement of the C4 clutch 69 and the C3 clutch 66. The C3 clutch 66 connects the ring gear member 34 with the ring gear member 44. The ring gear member 34, the ring gear member 44 and the carrier member 59 rotate at the same speed as the input shaft 17. The carrier member 39 rotates at the same speed as the ring gear member 24. The sun gear members 22 and 32 do not rotate. The carrier member 39 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of ring gear member 34 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30. The sun gear member 52 rotates at the same speed as the sun gear member 42. The ring gear member 54 does not rotate. The sun gear member 52 rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the carrier member 59 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50. The carrier member 49 rotates at the same speed as the output shaft 19. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, rotates at a speed determined from the speed of the ring gear member 44, the speed of the sun gear member 42 and the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 40. The numerical value of the eighth forward speed ratio is determined utilizing the ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios of the planetary gear sets 30, 40 and 50.<br>
[0079]	As will be understood by those skilled in the art, members of the gear sets<br>
20, 30, 40 and 50 rotating during the eighth forward speed ratio all rotate in the same direction. For instance, with respect to the planetary gear set 30, if the input shaft 17 (and therefore the ring gear member 34) is rotating clockwise, because the sun gear member 32 is held stationary, the carrier member 39 and the pinion gears 37 rotate in the same direction as the ring gear member 34. Because the carrier member 39 is connected with the ring gear member 24 and the sun gear member 22 is held stationary, the carrier member 29 and the pinion gears 27 also rotate in a clockwise direction. Moving to the planetary gear set 40, because the ring gear member 44 is connected with the ring gear member 34 via the C3 clutch 66, the ring gear member 44 rotates in a clockwise direction. Because the ring gear member 44 is continuously connected with the carrier<br><br>
23<br>
member 59 and because the ring gear member 54 is held stationary by the C4 clutch 69, the carrier member 59, the pinion gears 57 and the sun gear member 52 all rotate in a clockwise direction. Because the sun gear member 42 is continuously connected with the sun gear member 52, it too rotates in a clockwise direction. The carrier member 49, and therefore the output shaft 19, as well as the pinion gears 47 may be made to rotate in a clockwise direction as well if tooth number such as those for the planetary gear set 40 described above with respect to the sixth forward speed ratio and the truth tables of Figures 2A, 3A and 4A are utilized.<br>
[0080]	As set forth above, the engagement schedule for the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is shown in the truth table of Figure 2A. This truth table also provides an<br>
example of speed ratios that are available utilizing the following ring gear/sun gear tooth<br>
ratios: the value of the tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 20 is 2.45; the value of the<br>
tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 30 is 2.45; the value of the tooth ratio of the planetary<br>
gear set 40 is 3.86; and the value of the tooth ratio of the planetary gear set 50 is 2.89.<br>
[0081]	Also, the chart of Figure 2B describes the ratio steps that are attained<br>
utilizing the sample of tooth ratios given. For example, the step ratio between the first and second forward speed ratios is 1.41, while the step ratio between the Reverse Low ratio and the first forward speed ratio is -0.991. It should be noted that the single and double step forward ratio interchanges are of the single transition variety. A relatively deep first forward speed ratio (i.e., low gear ratio) of 3.357 is achieved, which is useful for towing applications. A relatively close ratio spread of 4.347 is achieved between the first and seventh speed ratios. The transmission 14 may achieve a somewhat higher ratio coverage as set forth in the truth table of Figure 3A and the chart of Figure 3B if the following ring gear/sun gear tooth ratios are employed in lieu of those discussed above with respect to the ratios set-forth'in Figures 2A,and'2B: • a32:19 tooth ratio for the planetary gear set 20; a 2.45 tooth ratio for the planetary gear set 30; a 3.11 tooth ratio for the planetary gear set 40; and a 2.19 tooth ratio for the planetary gear set 50. With these tooth ratios, a broader ratio coverage is achieved. For example, the ratio spread between the first and seventh forward speed ratios is 5.233, as set forth in the chart of Figure 3B.<br><br>
24<br>

said output shaft being continuously connected with a member of said third planetary gear set; and<br>
said six torque-transmitting mechanisms being engaged in combinations of two to establish seven forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios between said, input shaft and said output shaft.<br>
Seven,speed transmissions are provided that include four planetary gear sets having six torque-transmitting mechanisms with various fixed interconnections to provide seven forward speed ratios and three reverse speed ratios. The powertrain includes an engine and torque converter that is continuously connected to at least one of the planetary gear members and an output member that is continuously connected with another of the planetary gear members. The six torque-transmitting mechanisms are operated in combinations of two. All components rotating during forward speeds rotate in the same direction. Reduced component speeds and improved ratios are achieved.</td>
