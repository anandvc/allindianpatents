				<td>The present invention relates to silane, siloxane or polysiloxane merocyanine sulphone compound.<br>
The present invention concerns novel silane, siloxane or polysiloxane derivatives of merocyanine sulphone and their use in cosmetics as long UV-A filters.<br>
The present invention also concerns cosmetic compositions for topical use, in particular intended for the photoprotection of skin and/or hair, comprising an effective quantity of at least one silane, siloxane or polysiloxane derivative of merocyanine sulphone or a mixture of derivatives.<br>
Radiation with wavelengths in the range 280 nm [nanometre] to 400 nm is known to brown human skin, and radiation with wavelengths in the range 280 nm to 320 nm, known as UV-B radiation, is known to cause erythemas and burns to the skin which can interfere with the development of a natural tan.<br>
UV-A radiation with wavelengths in the range 320 nm to 400 nm is also known to cause the skin to brown, but is capable of inducing an alteration in the skin, in particular in the case of sensitive skin and/or skin continuously exposed to solar radiation. In particular, UV-A radiation causes loss of skin elasticity and the appearance of wrinkles, resulting in premature ageing of the skin. It encourages triggering of the erythematous reaction or amplifies that reaction in some subjects and may even be at the source of phototoxic or photoallergic reactions. Thus, for aesthetic and cosmetic reasons, such as preserving the natural elasticity of the skin, more and more people wish to control the effect of UV-A radiation on their skin. The term "sun protection factor" means the ratio of the irradiation period necessary to reach the erythematogenic threshold in the presence of a test filter to the irradiation period necessary to reach<br>
that same threshold in the absence of a filter.<br>
A number of organic compounds intended to protect the<br>
skin against UV-A and/or UV-B radiation have been<br>
proposed.<br>
The majority of them are aromatic compounds absorbing<br>
UV radiation in the zone in the range 280 nm to 315 nm<br>
or in the zone in the range 315 nm to 400 nm and<br>
beyond, or across both of those zones. They are<br>
usually formulated into sunscreen compositions which<br>
are in the form of oil-in-water emulsions or water-inoil<br>
emulsions. The organic filters, which are<br>
generally lipophilic or hydrophilic, are present in a<br>
dissolved form in one or the other of those phases in<br>
quantities appropriate for obtaining the desired sun<br>
protection factor (SPF).<br>
In addition to their solar radiation filtration<br>
capability, desirable photoprotective compounds must<br>
also have other good cosmetic properties, good<br>
solubility in the usual solvents, in particular in<br>
fatty substances such as oils or fats, and good<br>
resistance to water and perspiration (persistance), as<br>
well as very good photostability.<br>
Compounds which have been recommended for that purpose<br>
which may be cited include a particularly interesting<br>
family of filters constituted by carbonaceous<br>
merocyanine derivatives described in United States<br>
patent US-A-4 195 999 or International patent<br>
application WO-A-2004/006878. Those compounds have<br>
very good long UV-A filtering properties but have poor<br>
solubility in the usual organic solvents and in<br>
particular in fatty substances such as oils, and<br>
unsatisfactory photostability for certain merocyanine<br>
families.<br>
The Applicant has surprisingly discovered a novel<br>
family of silane, siloxane or polysiloxane derivatives<br>
of merocyanine sulphone with good long UV-A filtering<br>
properties, very good solubility in the usual organic<br>
solvents and excellent cosmetic properties compared<br>
with the merocyanines described in WO-A-2004/006878.<br>
The invention concerns a novel family of silane,<br>
siloxane or polysiloxane derivatives of merocyanine<br>
sulphone contained in formulae (1), (2) and (3) which<br>
will be described below in more detail.<br>
The invention also concerns a cosmetic or<br>
dermatological composition intended for the<br>
photoprotection of keratinous material containing, in a<br>
physiologically acceptable medium, at least one<br>
compound of formulae (1), (2) or (3).<br>
The term "physiologically acceptable medium" means a<br>
non-toxic medium which can be applied to the skin,<br>
lips, hair, eyelashes, eyebrows or nails. The<br>
composition of the invention may in particular<br>
constitute a cosmetic or dermatological composition.<br>
Other objectives will become apparent from a study of<br>
the description.<br>
