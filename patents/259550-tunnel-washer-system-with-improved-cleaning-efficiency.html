Referring now to drying chamber 18, a sump 160D is located below conveyer belt 32 to collect liquid from chamber 18. An exit conduit 198 fluidly connects sump 160D with shared drain conduit 190.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 1, diverters 150 are located between adjacent chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18 to divert the flow of liquids away from the adjacent chamber. In the illustrated embodiment, a diverter 150 is generally centered under each pair of spaced dividing curtains 40, below conveyer belt 32.<br>
Operation of tunnel washer 10 will now be described in detail. An article 4 (e.g., a cage) is placed' onto conveyer belt 32, where it is sequentially conveyed through chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18, as is conventionally known. In pre-washing chamber 12, article 4 is typically exposed to hot water to remove dirt and debris. In washing chamber 14, article 4 is typically exposed to a detergent solution comprised of hot water and a suitable detergent. In rinsing chamber 16, residual detergent solution is removed from article 4 by spraying article 4 with hot water. In drying chamber 18, hot air is typically blown on article 4 to dry article 4, and remove any residual moisture therefrom.<br>
As article 4 moves through dividing curtains 40 located at loading end 22, gaseous fluid (e.g., water vapor) escaping from pre-washing chamber 12 is captured in exhaust duct 60 at first inlet 62a, and exhausted to the ventilation system. Blower 68 draws gaseous fluid into exhaust duct 60. The spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 facilitates the flow of gaseous fluid into exhaust duct 60, and inhibits the escape of fluid external to tunnel washer 10 at loading end 22. Dividing curtains 40 provide a defined pathway for gaseous fluid to travel to exhaust duct 60, and provide a barrier for liquid fluids to inhibit their escape from tunnel washer 10 at loading end 22.<br>
The spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 located between pre-washing chamber 12 and washing chamber 14 inhibits the transfer of fluids between chambers 12 and 14. Likewise, the spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 located between washing chamber 14 and rinsing chamber 16 inhibits the transfer of fluids between chambers 14 and 16.<br><br><br>
As article 4 moves through dividing curtains 40 between rinsing chamber 16 and drying chamber 18, gaseous fluid (e.g., water vapor) escaping from rinsing chamber 16 is captured in exhaust duct 60 at second inlet 62b, and exhausted to the ventilation system. Blower 68 draws gaseous fluid into exhaust duct 60. The spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 facilitates the flow of gaseous fluid into exhaust duct 60, and inhibits the escape of fluid into drying chamber 18. Dividing curtains 40 provide a defined pathway for gaseous fluid to travel to exhaust duct 60, and provide a barrier to inhibit liquid fluids from escaping into drying chamber 18.<br>
As article 4 moves through dividing curtains 40 located at unloading end 24, gaseous fluid escaping from drying chamber 18 is captured in recirculation duct 90 at inlet 92. Blower 104 draws gaseous fluid into recirculation duct 90. Inside recirculation duct 90, gaseous fluid is reheated by heater 106, and returned to drying chamber 18 through lower outlet portion 94a and upper outlet portion 94b. The spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 facilitates the flow of gaseous fluid into recirculation duct 90 by providing a defined pathway for gaseous fluid to travel to recirculation duct 90. The spaced arrangement of dividing curtains 40 also provides a fluid barrier that inhibits the escape of fluid from tunnel washer 10 at unloading end 24.<br>
In the prior art, a pair of dividing curtains 40A are mounted to a mounting member 66 (FIG. 6), but are not spaced apart, as dividing curtains 40 of the present invention (FIG. 5). Furthermore, dividing curtains 40A of the prior art do not include protuberances 46, as provided by the present invention. By spacing dividing curtains 40 and forming protuberances 46 on the surfaces thereof, dividing curtains 40 are less likely to stick together, as articles 4 are conveyed therethrough (as shown in FIG. 5), or stick to the articles 4 as they pass through dividing curtains 40. When dividing curtains stick together, an opening is created that allows the transfer of fluids between the chambers. The arrangement and design of dividing curtains 40 of the present invention isolate adjacent chambers. In this manner, dividing curtains 40 provide "mist control" to retain fluids within tunnel washer 10, and inhibit the transfer of fluids between adjacent chambers of tunnel washer 10. Even if one of the pair of dividing curtains 40 is moving due to the presence of an article 4, the second dividing curtain 40 acts as a barrier, as best seen in FIG. 5. Thus, dividing curtains 40 of the<br><br><br>
present invention isolate chambers 12, 14, 16 and 18, thereby minimizing fluid transfer between chambers and to the exterior of tunnel washer 10.<br>
The number and location of exhaust inlets are optimized in tunnel washer 10 to minimize heat loss and fluid transfer. Inlet 62a, located at loading end 22, minimizes heat loss to the exterior of tunnel washer 10. Inlet 62b, located between rinsing chamber 16 and drying chamber 18, minimizes humidity transfer from rinsing chamber 16 to drying chamber 18. Consequently, drying efficacy is improved. Inlet 92 to recirculation duct 90, located at unloading end 24, also minimizes heat loss to the exterior of tunnel washer 10. Minimizing heat loss and fluid transfer contributes to a reduction in steam consumption required to maintain a desired temperature in tunnel washer 10.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 7-9, adjustable air manifold 110 is located inside drying chamber 18 to facilitate drying of articles 4. Air manifold 110 "floats" above articles 4 traveling through drying chamber 18. In this regard, bias members 116 suspend air tube 130 above articles 4 traveling through drying chamber 18. The distance between air tube 130 relative to the upper surface of article 4 is substantially maintained at distance D, regardless of the dimensions (i.e., height) of article 4 traveling therethrough. In this regard, as streams of pressurized air are emitted from nozzles 134 and sprayed against article 4 to dry article 4, the force of the air pressure applied to article 4 pushes air tube 130 away from article 4 to generally maintain a distance D between air tube 130 and the upper surface of article 4. As best seen in FIGS. 7 and 8, distance D is generally maintained regardless of the height of article 4. Accordingly, drying efficiency is substantially the same regardless of the height of article 4. In a preferred embodiment, the streams of pressurized air emitted from nozzle 134 are directed generally perpendicular to the surface of conveyer belt 32.<br>
It should be appreciated that air manifold 110 may also act as an additional barrier for preventing fluids from entering drying chamber 18 from rinsing chamber 16. This also contributes to drying efficacy.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, fluid recovery and circulation operations of chambers 12, 14, 16, and 18 will be described. Water sprayed into rinsing chamber 16 from clean water conduit 210 is recirculation inside rinsing chamber 16 and recycled to both washing chamber 14 and pre-washing chamber 12 via recycle conduit 180. The liquid used in chambers 12, 14 and 16 will be progressively cleaner, since more soil<br><br><br>
will be removed from article 4 after each sequential processing step in chambers 12, 14 and 16. Water sprayed into rinsing chamber 16 is collected in sump 160C and recirculation back into rinsing chamber 16 through recirculation conduit 170. Water collected in sump 160C is also recycled to chambers 14 and 16 through recycle conduit 180. Water sprayed into washing chamber 14 is collected in sump 160B and recirculation back into chamber 14 through recirculation conduit 170. Furthermore, water sprayed into pre-washing chamber 12 is collected in sump 160A and recirculation back into chamber 12 through recirculation conduit 170. Since articles 4 will be the most soiled when passing through pre-washing chamber 12, the recycled water in chamber 12 passes through filter 176 before being recirculation back into chamber 12.<br>
Overflow liquid in sumps 160B and 160C flow into sump 160A via overflow conduit 200. In the illustrated embodiment, each sump 160A, 160B and 160C has a progressively larger volume capacity. Furthermore, the height of inlets 196a, 202a, 202b are progressively higher within respective sumps 160A, 160B and 160C. Residual liquid collected by sump 160D in drying chamber 18 is directed to drain conduit 190 via exit conduit 198.<br>
Other modifications and alterations will occur to others upon their reading and understanding of the specification. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br>
