				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
TRANSMISSION CONTROLLING METHOD, SENDER APPARATUS AND<br>
RECEIVER APPARATUS FOR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission<br>
controlling method, a sender apparatus and a receiver<br>
apparatus for a wireless communication system, and<br>
particularly to a technique suitable for use with a<br>
re-sending controlling technique in MIMO (Multi Input<br>
Multi Output) transmission.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
While, regarding a mobile communication system such<br>
as a portable telephone system, a service of the third<br>
generation method according to a CDMA (Code Division<br>
Multiple Access) method has been started already,<br>
investigations of a next generation mobile communication<br>
system capable of implementing higher-speed communication<br>
on the basis of an OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access) method are proceeding (refer to<br>
Non-Patent Document i hereinafter described).<br>
[0003]<br>
Therefore, the MIMO as a technique for increasing<br>
the transmission rate has been proposed as a reliable<br>
 <br>
technique. An outline of a MIMO transmission system is<br>
depicted in FIG. 19. The MIMO transmission system<br>
depicted in FIG. 19 includes a sender apparatus 100 having<br>
a plurality of sending antennas (antenna systems) Tx#l,<br>
Tx#2, ..., and ?x#n (n is an integer of 2 or more) and a<br>
receiver apparatus 200 having a plurality of receiving<br>
antennas (antenna systems) Rx#l, Rx#2, ..., and Rx#n, MIMO<br>
is a spatial multiplex transmission technique wherein<br>
different data streams are set in parallel from the sending<br>
antennas Tx#i (i = 1 ~ n) to increase the transmission<br>
capacity in proportion to the number n of the sending<br>
antennas. The different sending antennas Tx#i are<br>
disposed so as not to have correlation with each Other,<br>
and the data streams sent from the sending antennas Tx#i<br>
individually pass along fading propagation paths<br>
independent of each other and are received by the receiving<br>
antennas Rx#i in a spatially mixed state with other<br>
different data streams.<br>
[0004]<br>
As an implementation example of such a MIMO<br>
transmission system as described above, for example, as<br>
depicted in FIG. 20, a method is available wherein a stream<br>
process is carried out independently for each antenna.<br>
For example, PARC (Fer Antenna Rate Control) wherein<br>
pre-coding (Preceding) is not carried out (refer to<br>
Non-Patent Document 2 hereinafter described), PSRC (Per<br>
Stream Rate Control) wherein pre-coding is carried out<br>
 <br>
(refer to Non-Patent Document 3 hereinafter described)<br>
and so forth are available.<br>
[0005]<br>
In particular, the system depicted in FIG. 20<br>
includes, for example, the sender apparatus 100 and the<br>
receiver apparatus 200 . The sender apparatus 100 includes,<br>
for example, a stream separation section 101, a CRC addition<br>
section 102 and a coding section 103 as well as a HARQ<br>
processing section 104 for each sending stream, a sending<br>
section 105 and a re-sending controlling section 106. And<br>
the receiver apparatus 200 includes, for example, a signal<br>
separation and synthesis section 201, a HARQ processing<br>
section 202 and a CRC calculation section 203 for each<br>
received stream, an ACK/NACK decision sec-ion 204 and a<br>
stream synthesis section 205. It is to be noted that a<br>
reference character ATR represents a receiving antenna<br>
of the sender apparatus 100 and another reference character<br>
ATT represents a sending antenna of the receiver apparatus<br>
200, and, in the present example, it is represented for<br>
the convenience of illustration that an ACK/NACK<br>
(Acknowledgement/Negative Acknowledgement) signal<br>
(acknowledgment signal) is sent from the sending antenna<br>
ATT and received by the receiving antenna ATR.<br>
[0006]<br>
Then, the sender apparatus (hereinafter referred<br>
to sometimes as sender side) 100 operates, for example,<br>
in accordance with a flow chart depicted in FIG. 21, and<br>
 <br>
the receiver apparatus (hereinafter referred to sometimes<br>
as receiver side) 200 operates, for example, in accordance<br>
with a flow chart depicted in FIG. 22.<br>
[0007]<br>
In particular, in the sender apparatus 10C, sending<br>
data are separated into sending streams of -he antenna<br>
systems Tx#i by the stream separation section 101 (step<br>
Al) and CRC (Cyclic Redundant Check) codes for error<br>
detection are added to each of the sending streams cf the<br>
antenna systems Tx#i by the CRC addition section 102 (step<br>
A2), and coding of the data streams is carried out for<br>
bit error correction by the coding section 103 and a HARQ<br>
(Hybrid Automatic Repeat request) process is carried out<br>
for re-sending control by the KARQ processing section 1C4<br>
(step A4) . Then, a sending antenna Tx#i for sending a HARQ<br>
block (process) is selected by the sending section 105,<br>
and the HARQ block is modulated and then sent to -he receiver<br>
apparatus 200. Here, while, where pre-coding is used (in<br>
case of yes at step A5) , each process can select a plurality<br>
of sending antennas Tx#i, in case of the PARC (in case<br>
of no at step A5), each process is sent from a sending<br>
antenna Tx#i determined in advance.<br>
[0003]<br>
On the other hand, in the receiver apparatus 200,<br>
as depicted in FIG. 22, if a signal sent from the sender<br>
apparatus 100 is received by the receiving antennas Rx#i,<br>
then separation and synthesis cf the received signals is<br>
 <br>
carried out by the signal separation and synthesis section<br>
201 (step 31), and it is decided whether or not each of<br>
the received signals (processes) is a re-sent process (step<br>
B2) . As a result, if the received signal is a re-sent<br>
process (in case of yes at step B2), then the receiver<br>
apparatus 200 synthesizes the signal received in the<br>
present reception cycle and a received signal of the same<br>
process received and stored in the preceding reception<br>
cycle by means of the HARQ processing section 202 (step<br>
B3), and checks CRC codes added to each process by means<br>
of the CRC calculation section 203 to detect bit errors<br>
(step B4) . It is to be noted that, "where the process<br>
received in the present reception cycle is not a re-sent<br>
process (in case of no at step B2) , synthesis by the HARQ<br>
process section 202 is not carried cut but bit error<br>
detection by the CRC calculation section 203 is carried<br>
out (step 34).<br>
[0009]<br>
Then, if a bit error is detected by the ACK/NACK<br>
decision section 204 (in case of yes at step 35), then<br>
the received process is retained and a NACK signal is sent<br>
as a reply to the sender apparatus 100 through the sending<br>
antenna ATT (step B6), but, if no bit error is detected<br>
(in case of no at step B5), then an ACK signal is sent<br>
as a reply to the sender apparatus 100 through the sending<br>
antenna ATT and the process is passed to an upper layer<br>
(step B7) . It is to be noted that the received signals<br>
 <br>
of the streams from which no error is detected are<br>
synthesized finally by the stream synthesis section 205<br>
and then outputted.<br>
[0010]<br>
In such series of processes as described above, an<br>
important function for high-speed communication is the<br>
HARQ. The HARQ is an ARQ method which is a combination<br>
of automatic re-sending request (ARQ) and error correction<br>
coding (FEC: Forward Error Correction). In particular,<br>
on the sender side 100, a block of information bits is<br>
error correction coded with a parity bit for error detection<br>
added, and all or some of the codes . If re-sending occurs,<br>
then all or some of coding bits of the current block are<br>
sent.<br>
[0011]<br>
On the receiver side 200, the synthesis process is<br>
carried out for individually corresponding bits of an<br>
existing block to a re-sent block, and error correction<br>
and error detection process are carried out again using<br>
the synthesis block obtained as a result of the synthesis<br>
process. In this manner, the receiver side 200<br>
repetitively carries out ACK/NACK reply sending to the<br>
sender side 100 and trial of a decoding process by re-sending<br>
until block errors are eliminated within a range of a<br>
predetermined number of times as an upper limit.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the next generation mobile communication,<br>
 <br>
particularly an N-channel Stop-and-Wait ARQ is applied<br>
(refer to Non-Patent Document 4 hereinafter described).<br>
Here, N represents an integer and represents the number<br>
of blocks (number of processes) which can be sent at the<br>
same time. For each cf processes sent at the same time,<br>
re-sending control by the Stop and Wait is carried out.<br>
[0013]<br>
An outline cf the N-channel Stop-and-Wait ARQ is<br>
illustrated in FIG. 23.<br>
Each process is sent within a unit interval of<br>
wireless transmission (TTI: Transmission Time Interval)<br>
and is identified with an identifier given as a process<br>
number N. In the case of FIG. 23, the process number N<br>
is N = 5 (0 ~ 4), and accordingly, the case of FIG. 23<br>
corresponds to a case of 5-channei Stop-and-Wait ARQ. It<br>
is to be noted that, while it is depicted in FIG. 23 that<br>
a process number is added to the data part of each process<br>
for the convenience of illustration, actually a process<br>
number is sent with a controlling channel and no process<br>
number is added to the data part cf each process. In<br>
particular, a process number is annexed to and sent together<br>
with the data part of each process (this similarly applies<br>
to the following description).<br>
[0014]<br>
If the receiver apparatus 200 receives a process<br>
from the sender apparatus 100, then it carries out error<br>
detection in such a manner as described above. Here, if<br>
 <br>
an error occurs with processes [1], [3] and [4] but no<br>
error occurs with processes [0] and [2], then regarding<br>
the processes [0] and [2] with which no error occurs, an<br>
ACK signal is sent as a reply to the sender apparatus 100,<br>
but regarding the processes [1], [31 and [4] with which<br>
an error occurs, a NACK signal is sen- as a reply to the<br>
sender apparatus 100 after they are retained into a memory<br>
(not depicted) . While also a reply of the ACK/NACK signal<br>
is sent with the controlling channel, in this instance,<br>
the process number need not be sent back.<br>
[0Q15]<br>
The receiver apparatus 200 adjusts the reply sending<br>
timing for each process and sends the ACK/NACK signal as<br>
a reply so that the sender apparatus 100 can identify to<br>
which process the ACK/NACK signal responds. Although, if<br>
the sender apparatus 100 receives an ACK signal, then<br>
sending of a new process is carried out, at this time,<br>
a process number which is not used in five processes in<br>
the past may be added arbitrarily including time at which<br>
the process number is added (in FIG. 23, process numbers<br>
which are not used are added in an ascending order).<br>
[0016]<br>
On the other hand, although, if the sender apparatus<br>
100 receives a NACK signal, then re-sending of a process<br>
with which an error occurs is carried out, at this time,<br>
a process number same as the process number in the preceding<br>
cycle is added. After the re-sending, the receiver<br>
 <br>
apparatus 200 recognizes the process number to decide with<br>
which process the received process should be synthesized.<br>
In particular, if the processes [1], [3] and [4] which<br>
are re-sent processes are received, then the received<br>
processes [1], [3] and [4] are packet-synthesized with<br>
the processes [i], [2] and [3], respectively, which<br>
individually have process numbers same as those retained<br>
upon NACK signal sending in the preceding cycle. After<br>
the synthesis, the CRC codes are checked, and if the<br>
processes are successfully received correctly, then the<br>
ACK is sent as a reply to the sender apparatus 100. On<br>
the other hand, if an error occurs, then the process after<br>
the synthesis is retained and the NACK signal is sent as<br>
a reply again to the sender apparatus 100.<br>
[0017]<br>
It is to be noted that, while two types of<br>
representative methods are available as a synthesis method,<br>
any of the synthesis methods may be utilized in the present<br>
invention. One of the synthesis methods is a type of a<br>
synthesis method wherein data fully same as that upon former<br>
sending is re-sent upon re-sending and a received signal<br>
upon former sending and another received signal upon<br>
re-sending are synthesized with each other to carry out<br>
production of data to be decoded, and the other one of<br>
the synthesis methods is a type of a synthesis method wherein<br>
a puncturing pattern of data after coding is changed upon<br>
re-sending to send bits which are not sent till then and<br>
 <br>
a received signal upon former sending and another received<br>
signal upon re-sending are synthesized wiTh each other<br>
to decrease the equivalent coding ratio so that the error<br>
correction capacity (coding gain) is enhanced. The latter<br>
technique is called IR (Incremental Redundancy).<br>
[0018]<br>
Such process processing as described above is carried<br>
out in a similar manner irrespective of difference of the<br>
PARC or the pre-coding. Therefore, description is<br>
continuously given below taking the PARC as an example.<br>
A manner of the N-channel Stop-and-Wait ARQ where<br>
the sender apparatus 100 and the receiver apparatus 200<br>
are ready for the PARC is illustrated in FIG. 24.<br>
[0019]<br>
Since the CRC addition, coding and HARQ processes<br>
are carried out independently for each antenna in the PARC<br>
as described above, an independent number is added also<br>
as a HARQ process number. In FIG. 24, a manner (refer to<br>
arrow marks of broken lines) is illustrated wherein<br>
re-sending occurs with the processes [1], [3] and [4] sent<br>
from the sending antenna Tx#l and with the process [1]<br>
sent from the sending antenna Tx#2 . In such a case as just<br>
described, since the HARQ is carried out for each antenna<br>
system as described above, re-sending control is carried<br>
out independently for each antenna system. It is to be<br>
noted that an addition method of the process number is<br>
carried out in accordance with a rule similar to that in<br>
 <br>
FIG. 23.<br>
[0020]<br>
Further, in the MIMO transmission in the next<br>
generation mobile communication system, in order to allow<br>
data signals sent from the different sending antennas Tx#i<br>
to be separated and synthesized among the sending antennas<br>
Tx#i, the sender apparatus 100 sends an antenna<br>
identification signal (for example, a pilot signal or a<br>
scrambling code).<br>
[0021]<br>
An example of pilot signal addition where the two<br>
sending antennas of the sender apparatus 100 are used is<br>
depicted in FIG. 25. As depicted in (1) and (2) of FIG. 25,<br>
the pilot signal (R: Reference Symbol) is added in the<br>
same time series but in different frequency series between<br>
the antenna systems Tx#l and Tx#2. The receiver apparatus<br>
200 refers to the pilot signal to separate a signal of<br>
the antenna system Tx#i from the received signal by the<br>
antenna system Rx#l of the receiver apparatus 200 and<br>
separates a signal of the antenna system Tx#2 from the<br>
received signal by the antenna systems Rx#2 of the receiver<br>
apparatus 200, and then synthesizes the separated signals<br>
with each other to restore the sent stream (process).<br>
Further, association between the antenna systems and the<br>
pilot signals is sent with notification information.<br>

[0022]<br>
As a communication environment to which the MIMO<br>
transmission system is applied, for example, such a cell<br>
configuration as depicted in FIG. 26 is available. In<br>
particular, the cell configuration depicted in FIG. 26<br>
is a form wherein one cell is divided into areas depending<br>
upon the form of the MIMO transmission, and where a mobile<br>
station 4 00 exists in an area (MIMO multiplex transmission<br>
area) 302 on the inside of the base station 300 as depicted<br>
in (1) of FIG. 26, the MIMO multiplex transmission (in<br>
(1) of FIG. 26, sent with 2 streams) is used. However,<br>
where the mobile station 300 exists in an area (non-MIMO<br>
multiplex transmission area) 303 on the outside of the<br>
base station 300, non-MIMO multiplex transmission (in (1)<br>
of FIG. 26, 1-stream transmission) is used. It is to be<br>
 <br>
noted that the "non-MIMO multiplex transmission" signifies<br>
MIMO diversity transmission or MIMO single transmission<br>
wherein sending and reception of one stream are carried<br>
out with one antenna.<br>
[0023]<br>
Further, as depicted in (2) of FIG. 26, where, even<br>
in the MIMO multiplex transmission area 302, the mobile<br>
station 400 is within an area 301 in the proximity of the<br>
base station 300 and line-of-sight communication is<br>
available, also there is a case wherein non-MIMC multiplex<br>
transmission (1-stream transmission in (2) of FIG. 26)<br>
is carried cut on purpose. This is because, in the case<br>
of the line-of-sight communication, since an inter-antenna<br>
correlation occurs, there is the possibility that<br>
separation and synthesis of signals by the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 00 may be difficult and a high throughput cannot<br>
be obtained.<br>
In such a case as just described, there is the<br>
possibility that, even if the mobile station 400 is in<br>
the area 301 in the proximity of the base station 300,<br>
a higher throughput may be obtained if not the MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission but non-MIMO multiplex transmission is<br>
carried out with a high degree of modulation and a high<br>
coding ratio.<br>
[0024]<br>
In this manner, the MIMO multiplex transmission is<br>
applied not fixedly in 1 cell, but non-MIMC multiplex<br>
 <br>
transmission is sometimes applied depending upon the<br>
existing position of the mobile station 400 . For example,<br>
the MIMO multiplex transmission is carried out where the<br>
wireless quality (for example, an average value of the<br>
3N ratio with which the mobile station 400 reports to the<br>
base station 300) of the mobile station 400 is higher than<br>
a certain threshold value, but ncn-MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission is carried out where the wireless quality<br>
is lower than the threshold value.<br>
[0025]<br>
At this time, since the number of streams decreases<br>
from plural streams to one stream, in the method wherein<br>
a process number is added independently for each antenna<br>
system, for example, like the PARC, when the number of<br>
streams decreases, the possibility occurs that<br>
communication cannot be continued because process numbers<br>
of the HARQ overlap (compete) with each other.<br>
[0026]<br>
For example, an example of operation where the<br>
transmission mode is changed over from the MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission to the MIMO diversity transmission in the<br>
PARC is illustrated in FIG. 27. The example indicates a<br>
case wherein the ACK/NACK signal is sent as a reply with<br>
one stream.<br>
[0027]<br>
It is assumed that processes [0], [1] and [2] are<br>
sent from the antenna systems Tx#l and Tx#2 of the sender<br>
 <br>
apparatus 100 at such timings as illustrated in FIG. 27<br>
and, after the ACK signals corresponding to the processes<br>
[0] and [1] sent from the antenna systems Tx#l and Tx#2<br>
are sent as replies from the receiver apparatus 200 to<br>
the sender apparatus 100, the existing position of the<br>
mobile station 400 is moved at a riming indicated by<br>
reference numeral 500 in FIG. 27 form the MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission area 302 to the non-MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission (MIMO diversity transmission area) area 301<br>
or 303 which are depicted in FIG. 25.<br>
[0023]<br>
At this time, if the main antenna system of the sender<br>
apparatus 100 for carrying out a process of a stream flowing<br>
therein is the antenna system Tx#2, then the sender<br>
apparatus 100 sends the process [2] accumulated before<br>
the transmission mode is changed over to the MIMO diversity-<br>
transmission from the antenna systems Tx#l and Tx#2. The<br>
receiver apparatus 200 receives the signals by means of<br>
the antenna systems Rx#l and Rx#2 and carries out synthesis<br>
of the received signals to construct the process [2]. Then,<br>
although the receiver apparatus 200 tries to carry out<br>
packet synthesis between the constructed process [2] and<br>
the process [2] retained upon sending in the last cycle,<br>
the following subject arises here.<br>
[0029]<br>
(Subject 1) The receiver apparatus 200 cannot<br>
recognize with which retained process the re-sent process<br>
 <br>
[2] should be synthesized. In particular, for example,<br>
while the receiver apparatus 200 receives the re-sent<br>
process [2] with the MIMO diversity as depicted in FIG.<br>
28, where the packet synthesis is carried out referring<br>
only to the process number as described above, since the<br>
process [2] is retained by both of the antenna system Rx#l<br>
and the antenna system Rx#2, it cannot be decided with<br>
which process the synthesis should be carried cut. For<br>
example, if the synthesis with the process (refer to<br>
reference numeral 601) retained by the main antenna system<br>
Rx#2 is attempted, then the packet synthesis between the<br>
process [2] (refer to reference numeral 602) of the antenna<br>
system Rx#l and the process [2] of the antenna system Rx#2<br>
indicated by reference numeral 601 is carried cut,<br>
resulting in deterioration of the matching property of<br>
the synthesis.<br>
[0030]<br>
In addition, also the following subject arises.<br>
(Subject 2) In the sender apparatus 100, such<br>
re-sending in error as described in cases 1 and 2 below<br>
occurs.<br>
[0031]<br>
(Case 1) Where sending of the ACK/NACK signal as<br>
a reply is carried out through timing adjustment<br>
In this instance, the reply timing (reply sending<br>
time and reply frequency) of the ACK/NACK signal is conveyed<br>
to the mobile station by the base station.<br>
 <br>
An outline is illustrated in FIG. 29. The receiver<br>
apparatus 200 sends the ACK/NACK signal as a reply through<br>
the timing adjustment of the main antenna system Rx#2.<br>
At this time, the sender apparatus 100 receives the reply<br>
with timing information of the main antenna system Tx#2.<br>
In this case, since the timing at which the sender apparatus<br>
100 receives the replay overlaps with the re-sending timing<br>
of the process [2] of the antenna systems Ix#2 denoted<br>
by reference numeral 603 as seen in FIG. 29, there is the<br>
possibility that, while the process [21 of the antenna<br>
systems Tx#l is to be re-sent originally, the process [2]<br>
of the antenna systems Tx#2 may possibly be re-sent in<br>
error. At this time, the process [2] cf the antenna system<br>
Tx#l cannot be re-sent.<br>
[0032]<br>
(Case 2) Where sending of a reply of the ACK/NACK<br>
signal is carried cut not through time timing adjustment<br>
but through the process number<br>
The case 2 is a case wherein sending of a reply of<br>
the ACK/NACK signal is executed without carrying out the<br>
timing adjustment. Accordingly, different from the case<br>
1, while the instruction of the reply timing adjustment<br>
need not be carried out, the process number must be applied<br>
upon reply of the ACK/NACK.<br>
An outline is illustrated in FIG. 30. The receiver<br>
apparatus 200 sends a reply cf the ACK/NACK signal<br>
explicitly indicating the process number from the main<br>
 <br>
antenna systems Rx#2. Thereupon, the reply is received<br>
by the antenna systems Tx#2. At this time, if the reply<br>
for the process [2] of the antenna system Tx#l is received,<br>
then the sender apparatus 100 misinterprets the reply as<br>
a NACK signal with regard to the process [2] of the antenna<br>
system Tx#2 as seen in FIG. 30. Therefore, the process<br>
[2] of the antenna system ?x#l cannot be re-sent.<br>
[0033]<br>
In this manner, a subject gives rise that, if<br>
overlapping of a process number occurs between different<br>
antenna systems, then the receiver apparatus 2 00 cannot<br>
decide which processes of which antenna systems should<br>
be synthesized with each other while, in the sender<br>
apparatus 100, re-sending in error of a process occurs<br>
and the process to be re-sent originally cannot be re-sent.<br>
[0034]<br>
Further, also where an acknowledgment (ACK/NACK<br>
signal) is sent as a replay from the receiver apparatus<br>
200 to the sender apparatus 100 with 2 streams, a subject<br>
similar to that described above arises. A manner of this<br>
is illustrated in FIGS. 31 and 32. In particular, in the<br>
receiver apparatus 200, it cannot be decided with which<br>
one of the processes retained by the antenna system Rx#l<br>
and the antenna system Rx#2 the re-sent process [2] should<br>
be synthesized as seen in FIG. 28. Further, also in the<br>
sender apparatus 100, subjects similar to those described<br>
with reference to FIGS. 29 and 30 occur.<br>
 <br>
[0035]<br>
In particular, if the transmission mode is changed<br>
over from the MIMO multiplex transmission to the MIMO<br>
diversity transmission, then:<br>
(1)	while, where an acknowledgment; to be sent as<br>
a replay from the receiver apparatus 200 is sent as a reply<br>
from the antenna system Rx#2, the ACK/NACK signal is sent;<br>
back from the sending antenna ATT 2 of the receiver apparatus<br>
200 as seen in FIG. 31, since, in this instance, the<br>
operation of the sender apparatus 100 is similar to those<br>
in the cases illustrated in FIGS. 29 and 30, the process<br>
[2] of the antenna system Tx#2 is re-sent in error and<br>
theprocess [2] of the antenna systemTx#i cannot be re-sent ;<br>
[0036]<br>
(2)	while, where an acknowledgment to be sent as<br>
a replay from the receiver apparatus 200 is sent as a reply<br>
by the MIMO diversity, since the ACK/NACK signal is sent<br>
through the sending antennas ATT1 and ATT2 as seen in FIG. 32,<br>
the sender apparatus 100 carries cut diversity reception<br>
of the signals sent as a reply from the receiving antennas<br>
ATR1 and ATR2. However, since the main antenna systems<br>
is the antenna system Tx#2, it is decided finally that<br>
the signals described above are replies for the antenna<br>
system Tx#2. Therefore, the process [2] of the antenna<br>
system Tx#2 is re-sent in error and the process [2] of<br>
the antenna system Tx#l cannot be re-sent.<br>
[0037]<br>
 <br>
The present invention has been made in view of such<br>
subjects as described above, and it is an object of the<br>
present invention to maintain the matching property of<br>
process numbers (that is, stream identification) so that<br>
communication can be continued normally also where the<br>
number of transmission streams varies (decreases) as in<br>
a case wherein the transmission mode is changed over from<br>
the MIMO multiplex transmission to the MIMO diversity<br>
transmission.<br>

regarding stream data which is a decrease control target.<br>
[0043]<br>

decrease control after sending of the unsent data is<br>
completed.<br>
[0044]<br>
(7)	Also, the sender apparatus may monitor wireless<br>
quality with the receiver apparatus, and carry cut, if<br>
the wireless quality becomes lower than a predetermined<br>
threshold value, the decrease control even if sending of<br>
the remaining data is not completed.<br>
[0045]<br>
(8)	Further, the sender apparatus may monitor<br>

annex, for each of the plural pieces of the stream data,<br>

a sending section adapted to send the data block to which<br>
the data block identification information is annexed to<br>
the receiver apparatus, and a controlling section adapted<br>
to control the data block identification information<br>
annexing section such that the data block identification<br>
information to be annexed to the data block is not<br>
competitive between the stream data.<br>
[0047]<br>
(10)	Here, the controlling section may comprise an<br>
antenna identifier production section for providing<br>
information including an antenna identifier relating to<br>

the received data block and send the resulting re-sending<br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0052]<br>
With the present invention, at least such an effect<br>
and an advantage as described just below are obtained.<br>
In particular, also in a case wherein the number<br>
of transmission streams between the sender apparatus and<br>
the receiver apparatus varies (decreases) as in a case<br>
wherein the transmission mode is changed over from the<br>
MIMO multiplex transmission to non-MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission (MIMO diversity transmission or the like),<br>
since competition of data block identification does not<br>
occur between the transmission streams, re-sending in<br>
 <br>
error of a dara block from the sender apparatus and synthesis<br>
in error of the data block in the receiver apparatus can<br>
be avoided. Accordingly, normal communication (stream<br>
transmission) can be continued between the sender<br>
apparatus and the receiver apparatus.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0055]<br>
In the following, embodiments of the present<br>
invention are described with reference to the drawings.<br>
 <br>
It is to be noted, however, that it is a matter of course<br>
that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments<br>
described below but can be carried out in various modified<br>
forms without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0056]<br>
[A] Description of the First Embodiment<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram depicting a configuration<br>
of a MIM0 transmission system according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and the MIMO<br>
transmission system depicted in FIG. 1 includes at least<br>
one sender apparatus 1 having a plurality of sending<br>
antennas (antenna systems) Tx#l, Tx#2, ... and Tx#n and at<br>
least one receiver apparatus 2 having a plurality of<br>
receiving antennas (antenna systems) Rx#l, Rx#2, ... and<br>
Rx#n. It is to be noted that the sender apparatus 1 can<br>
be applied, for example, as a sending system cf a base<br>
station apparatus and the receiver apparatus 2 can be<br>
applied as a receiving system of a mobile station apparatus .<br>
Further, while the number of sending antennas and the number<br>
of receiving antennas are equal to each other (n) in the<br>
present embodiment, the numbers may be different from each<br>
other.<br>
[0057]<br>
Then, taking notice of essential part of the sender<br>
apparatus 1, the sender apparatus 1 includes, for example,<br>
a stream separation section 11, a CRC addition section<br>
 <br>
12 and a coding section 13 as well as a HARQ sending<br>
processing section 14 for each sending stream, a sending<br>
section 15, a re-sending controlling section 16 and a<br>
process number addition section 17. Meanwhile, raking<br>
notice of essential part of the receiver apparatus 2, the<br>
receiver apparatus 2 includes, for example, a signal<br>
separation and synthesis section 21, a HARQ reception<br>
processing section 22 and a CRC calculation section 23<br>
for each received stream, an ACK/NACK decision section<br>
24, a stream synthesis section 25 and a process number<br>
distribution section 26. It is to be noted that, also in<br>
FIG. 1, reference character ATR represents a receiving<br>
antenna of the sender apparatus I and ATT represents a<br>
sending antenna of the receiver apparatus 2, and it is<br>
premised for the convenience of description that an<br>
acknowledgment (ACK/NACK signal) is sent from the sending<br>
antenna ATT of the receiver apparatus 2 with one stream<br>
and then is received by the receiving antenna ATR of the<br>
sender apparatus 1.<br>
[0058]<br>
Here, in the sender apparatus I, the stream<br>
separation section 11 separates a sending data signal into<br>
sending streams of the antenna systems Tx#i and the CRC<br>
addition sections 12 add CRC codes for error detection<br>
to the sending streams, and the coding sections 13 carry<br>
out coding of the sending streams to which the CRC codes<br>
are added into required error correction codes such as<br>
 <br>
turbo codes or the like.<br>
[0059]<br>
The HARQ sending processing sections 14 carry out<br>
a HARQ process (blocking) for the sending streams for each-<br>
process number and then transfer the resulting sending<br>
streams to the sending section 15, and temporarily retain<br>
the HARQ blocks (processed) into a memory not depicted<br>
in preparation for re-sending control. The sending<br>
section 15 carries out a required wireless sending process<br>
including modulation by a required modulation method (for<br>
example, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM or the like) , DA conversion,<br>
frequency conversion (up convert) into wireless frequency<br>
(RF) signals and so forth for the processes inputted from<br>
the HARQ sending processing sections 14 and sends the<br>
resulting process to the receiver apparatus 2 through one<br>
of the sending antennas Tx#i.<br>
[0060]<br>
The re-sending controlling section 16 decides<br>
whether or not re-sending is required based on the ACK/NACK<br>
signal from the receiver apparatus 2 received through the<br>
receiving antenna ATR and specified, if it is decided that<br>
re-sending is required, an antenna system Tx#i to be used<br>
for re-sending and a process to be re-sent. Then, the<br>
re-sending controlling section 16 controls so that, from<br>
the memory cf the HARQ sending processing section 14<br>
corresponding to the antenna systems Tx#i of the re-sending<br>
target, the retained process is read out and then the read<br>
 <br>
out process is transferred to the sending section 15. It<br>
is to be noted that the antenna systems Tx#i to be used<br>
for re-sending and the process to be re-sent can be specified,<br>
for example, through timing adjustment of the previously<br>
described ACK/NACK signal or explicit indication of the<br>
process number for the ACK/NACK signal hereinafter<br>
described.<br>
[0061]<br>
Then, the process number addition section 17 adds<br>
a process number for each HARQ block (data block) in each<br>
HARQ sending processing section 14, and, in the present<br>
embodiment, information having a format of (antenna<br>
identifier) + (number) is applied as the process number<br>
to the HARQ sending processing section 14 so that:<br>
information which is not competitive (does not overlap)<br>
among the antenna systems Tx#i (sending streams), that<br>
is, a sending stream identifier, is added to the sending<br>
stream. For example, as depicted generally in FIG. 2, the<br>
process number to be added to the sending stream of the<br>
antenna system Tx#l, process number to be added to the<br>
sending stream of the antenna system Tx#2 and process number<br>
to be added to the sending stream of the antenna system<br>
Tx#n can be represented as "0...00xxx", "0...01yyy" and<br>
"l...llzzz" in bit string representation (where x, y and<br>
z individually represent 0 or 1) , respectively. The sender<br>
apparatus 1 adds such unique process numbers as just<br>
described to the sending streams and transmits the<br>
 <br>
resulting sending streams to the receiver apparatus 2.<br>
[0062]<br>
In particular, each HARQ sending processing section<br>
14 implements a function as a data block identification<br>
information addition section for adding a process number<br>
(data block identification information) tO a process (data<br>
block) for each of plural streams and the process number<br>
addition section 17 implements a function as a controlling<br>
section for controlling the HARQ sending processing<br>
section 14 so that the process numbers added to the processes<br>
are not competitive among the streams. Further, the<br>
process number addition section 17 implements also a<br>
function as an antenna identifier production section for<br>
applying information including an antenna identifier<br>
regarding a sending antenna Tx#i of a stream as the process<br>
number to be added to the process of the stream to the<br>
HARQ sending processing section 14.<br>
[0063]<br>
On the other hand, in the receiver apparatus 2, the<br>
signal separation and synthesis section 21 can separate,<br>
under the control of the process distribution section 26,<br>
a signal sent from the sending antennas Tx#i (i = 1 to<br>
n) and received in a spatially multiplexed state by the<br>
receiving antennas Rx#i for each process and carry out,<br>
upon MIMO diversity, a diversity synthesis process . Then,<br>
the HARQ reception processing sections 22 store the<br>
received streams (processes) obtained by the signal<br>
 <br>
separation and synthesis section 21 together with the<br>
process number in preparation for the re-sending synthesis<br>
process and synthesize the stored processes with re-sent<br>
processes having the same process number from the sender<br>
apparatus 1.<br>
[0064]<br>
In particular, the signal separation and synthesis<br>
section 21 implements a function as a reception section<br>
for receiving a process sent after with a process number<br>
(number information including an antenna identifier} ,<br>
which is not competitive among the streams, added for each<br>
stream by the sender apparatus 1, and each HARQ reception<br>
processing section 22 implements a function as a re-sending<br>
synthesis section for carrying out a re-sending synthesis<br>
process between a process received already and a re-sent<br>
process to which the same process is added based on the<br>
process number added to the received process received by<br>
the signal separation and synthesis section 21 as the<br>
reception section.<br>
[0065]<br>
Each CRC calculation section 23 carries out CRC<br>
calculation for a received stream obtained by the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 to carry cut error check,<br>
and the ACK/NACK decision section 2 4 produces an<br>
acknowledgment signal based on a result of the CRC<br>
calculation and sends (feeds back) the produced signal<br>
from the sending antenna ATT to the sender apparatus 1.<br>
 <br>
In particular, the ACK/NACK decision section 24 produces<br>
an ACK signal where the CRC calculation result indicates<br>
a normal state (OK) but produces a NACK signal where the<br>
CRC calculation result indicates an abnormal state (KG) ,<br>
and feeds back the produced signal to the sender apparatus<br>
[0066]<br>
It is to be noted, however, that, as hereinafter<br>
described, the ACK/NACK decision section 2 4 in the present<br>
embodiment can add part (antenna identifier) or all<br>
(process number) of the process number information to the<br>
acknowledgment signal (ACK/NACK signal) and sends the<br>
resulting signal to the sender apparatus 1. In other words,<br>
the ACK/NACK decision section 24 in the present embodiment<br>
implements a function as a re-sending request sending<br>
section for adding an antenna identifier or a process number<br>
to a re-sending request (NACK signal) regarding a receiving<br>
process and sending the resulting signal to the sender<br>
apparatus 1.<br>
[0067]<br>
The stream synthesis section 25 synthesizes those<br>
streams whose CRC calculation result by the CRC calculation<br>
sections 23 indicate OK with each other and outputs a result<br>
of the synthesis as received data.<br>
Then, the process distribution section 2 6 identifies<br>
the process number of the received process and controls<br>
the signal separation and synthesis process by the signal<br>
 <br>
separation and synthesis section 21 so that the received<br>
process is distributed and inputted to one of the HARQ<br>
reception processing sections 22. It is to be noted that,<br>
in order to allow identification of the process number,<br>
in the process distribution section 26, information<br>
relating to the process number to be used in the process<br>
number addition section 17 and an addition method of the<br>
process number is stored in advance in a memory or the<br>
like not depicted, and the addition method of the process<br>
number is shared between the sender apparatus 1 and the<br>
receiver apparatus 2 .<br>
[0068]<br>
Operation of the MIMO transmission system of the<br>
present embodiment configured in such a manner as described<br>
above is described below with reference to FIGS. 3 to S.<br>
First, in the sender apparatus 1, the stream<br>
separation section 11 separates sending data into sending<br>
streams for the antenna systems Tx#i and the corresponding<br>
CRC addition sections 12 add CRC codes individually to<br>
the sending streams. Thereafter, the coding sections 13<br>
perform coding into required error correction codes such<br>
as turbo codes or the like for the individual sending streams<br>
and input the resulting sending streams to the HARQ sending<br>
processing sections 14.<br>
[0069]<br>
Each of the HARQ sending processing sections 14<br>
performs a HARQ process (blocking) for the corresponding<br>
 <br>
sending stream inputted from the corresponding coding<br>
section 13 and adds a process number to the corresponding<br>
sending stream under the control of the process number<br>
addition section 17 as seen in FIG. 2, and then retains<br>
a HARQ block (process) in preparation for the re-sending<br>
control and transfers the HARQ block to the sending section<br>
15.<br>
[0070]<br>
Consequently, the sending section 15 carries out.<br>
the above described wireless sending process for the<br>
processes inputted from the HARQ sending processing<br>
sections 14 and sends a resulting process to the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 through one of the sending antennas Tx#i. A<br>
concept of a manner of this is illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the manner in a case wherein the sending<br>
and receiving antenna systems individually indicate n =<br>
2, and a manner is illustrated in FIG. 3 that it is<br>
determined that the "antenna identifiers" of the antenna<br>
systems Tx#l and Tx#2 are "0" and "1", respectively, and<br>
the "number" of the HARQ blocks is 0, 1, 2 and ..., and process<br>
numbers such as "0-0", "0-1", "0-2" or ... are successively<br>
added individually to the processes to be sent from the<br>
antenna systems Tx#l and process numbers such as "1-0",<br>
"1-1", "1-2" or ... are successively added individually to<br>
the processes to be sent from the antenna systems Tx#2.<br>
Then, the resulting processes are sent to the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 (refer to solid line arrow marks directed toward<br>
 <br>
the downward direction on the plane of FIG. 3).<br>
[0071]<br>
It is to be noted that the sender apparatus 1 carries<br>
out the stream sending while maintaining the addition<br>
method of the process number by the process number addition<br>
section 17 similarly as in the case described above also<br>
after the number of used antenna systems decreases as in<br>
the case wherein a changeover from the MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission to the MIMO diversity transmission<br>
(hereinafter referred to sometimes as transmission mode<br>
changeover) occurs (refer to reference numeral 500 in<br>
FIG. 3) . Here, if the stream sending by the antenna<br>
systems other than the main antenna system Tx#i ends, then<br>
the sending and receiving of a process may be carried out<br>
with the antenna identifier omitted. However, the "main<br>
antenna system" signifies an antenna system used even<br>
before and after the transmission mode changeover (this<br>
similarly applies to the following description) and is<br>
the antenna system Tx#2 in the example of FIG. 3.<br>
[0072]<br>
An operation flow chart of the sender apparatus 1<br>
including such an option as described above is depicted<br>
in FIG. 4. In particular, the sender apparatus 1 carries<br>
out sending of a stream with a process number annexed as<br>
described above by means of the process number addition<br>
section 17 (step Sll) and monitors and decides whether<br>
or not a transmission mode changeover (change to the MIMO<br>
 <br>
diversity transmission) occurs by means of the re-sending<br>
controlling section 16 (step S12). If the transmission<br>
mode changeover does not yet occur (in case of no at step<br>
312) , then the re-sending controlling section 16 controls<br>
the process number addition section 17 and the HARQ sending<br>
processing section 14 so that the sending of a stream to<br>
which a process number is added is continuously carried<br>
cut as it is.<br>
[0073]<br>
On the other hand, if a transmission mode changeover<br>
occurs (in case of yes at step S12), then the re-sending<br>
controlling section 16 decides whether or not data<br>
(process) to be sent from any of the antenna systems other<br>
than the main antenna system Tx#i is absent (step 313),<br>
and, if such data is present (in case of no at step 313) ,<br>
then the re-sending controlling section 16 controls the<br>
process number addition section 1.7 and the HARQ sending<br>
processing section 14 so that a process number is added<br>
by the process number addition section 17 and then stream<br>
sending is carried similarly as at step S11 (step S14).<br>
[0074]<br>
On the other hand, if data (process) to be sent from<br>
any of the antenna systems other than the main antenna<br>
systems Tx#i is absent (in case of yes at step S13) , then<br>
the re-sending controlling section 16 controls the process<br>
number addition section 17 and the HARQ sending processing<br>
section 14 so that a process number from which the antenna<br>
 <br>
identifier which is an element of the process number is<br>
omitted is added and then carries out stream sending (step<br>
S15) .<br>
[0075]<br>
On the Other hand, in the receiver apparatus 2, a<br>
signal received by each of the receiving antennas Rx#i<br>
is separated into different processes by the signal<br>
separation and synthesis section 21 and each separated<br>
signal is distributed to one of the HARQ reception<br>
processing sections 22 under the control of the process<br>
distribution section 26.<br>
The HARQ reception processing section 22 stores the<br>
receive process from the signal separation and synthesis<br>
section 21 together with the process number in preparation<br>
for the re-sending synthesis process and synthesizes a<br>
re-sent process having the same process number and re-sent<br>
from the sender apparatus 1 with the stored process (where<br>
there is no re-sent process, the received process is<br>
outputted as it is).<br>
[0076]<br>
Thereafter, CRC calculation is carried out for the<br>
received process outputted from the HARQ reception<br>
processing section 22 by the corresponding CRC calculation<br>
section 23 and an acknowledgment signal (ACK signal or<br>
NACK signal) according to a result of the calculation is<br>
produced by the ACK/NACK decision section 24. Then, the<br>
produced signal is fedback to the sender apparatus 1 through<br>
 <br>
the sending antenna ATT (refer to arrow marks directed<br>
upwardly on the plane of FIG. 3) . However, the ACK/NACK<br>
decision section 24 applies the antenna identifier or the<br>
process number to the acknowledgment signal.<br>
[0077]<br>
It is to be noted that any process with regard :c<br>
which the CRC calculation result is normal is synthesized<br>
with processes of different received streams by the stream<br>
synthesis section 25 and a result of the synthesis is<br>
outputted as data which is successfully received correctly,<br>
but any process with regard to which the CRC calculation<br>
result is abnormal is abandoned without being inputted<br>
to the stream synthesis section 25.<br>
[ C 0 7 S ]<br>
Further, the sender apparatus 1 controls the process<br>
number addition section 17 and the HARQ sending processing<br>
section 14 in order to send a new process if the ACK signal<br>
is received as the acknowledgment signal from the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 but to re-send the process with regard to which<br>
the decision result in the receiver apparatus 2 is abnormal<br>
if the NACK signal is received. It is to be noted that<br>
the process to be newly sent or re-sent is specified based<br>
on the antenna identifier or the process number included<br>
in the received acknowledgment signal.<br>
[0079]<br>
Consequently, the HARQ sending processing section<br>
14 can re-send, also upon process re-sending, a process<br>
 <br>
having the process number same as that upon sending in<br>
the preceding cycle and the receiver apparatus 2 can carry<br>
out correct synthesis of the process by means of the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 even if the number of<br>
sending streams (number of sending antennas) is fluctuated<br>
as in a case wherein the transmission mode is changed over<br>
from the MIMO multiplex transmission to non-MIMO multiplex<br>
transmission such as the MIMO diversity transmission, MIMO<br>
single transmission or the like through the identification<br>
of the received process number and the distribution control<br>
of the received process by the process distribution section<br>
26.<br>
[ 0 0 8 0 ]<br>
For example, if a case wherein the changeover to<br>
the MIMO diversity transmission occurs at a timing<br>
indicated by reference numeral 500 in FIG. 3 to reduce<br>
the number of the sending antennas from two to one (only<br>
the antenna systems Tx#2) is considered, then whichever<br>
process number a re-sent process received from the sender<br>
apparatus 2 after the changeover just described (refer<br>
to a double arrow mark directed downwardly on the plane<br>
of FIG. 3) has, the receiver apparatus 2 can carry cut<br>
correct distribution of the process by means of the process<br>
distribution section 26 so that the correct synthesis of<br>
processes, that is, synthesis of the processes<br>
individually having the process numbers same as each other,<br>
is carried out. In particular, degradation of the matching<br>
 <br>
property of the synthesis can be prevented (the subject<br>
1 described above can be solved).<br>
[0081]<br>
Further, by contriving the replying method of the<br>
ACK/NACK in such a manner as given in cases 1 and 2 described<br>
below, also the subject 2, that is, -he subject that, in<br>
the sender apparatus 1, re-sending in error of a process<br>
occurs and a process to be originally re-sent cannot be<br>
re-sent, can be solved.<br>
[0082]<br>
(Case 1) Where the ACK/NACK signal is received<br>
through timing adjustment (FIG. 5 and 6)<br>
A diagram of a concept in the present case<br>
corresponding to FIG. 3 is depicted in FIG . 5. As depicted<br>
in FIG. 5, also after a transmission mode changeover (change<br>
to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (refer to<br>
reference numeral 500), the receiver apparatus 2 utilizes<br>
(adds) the antenna identifier of each antenna system to<br>
carry out sending of a reply of an acknowledgment signal<br>
(ACK/NACK signal). Here, "utilization" of the antenna<br>
identifier signifies not that the antenna identifier is<br>
added explicitly to send the ACK/NACK signal as a reply-<br>
but that, for example, even if it is determined that the<br>
number of such main antenna systems is one, the sender<br>
apparatus issues an instruction of a frequency band for<br>
the ACK/NACK signal of each antenna system to the receiver<br>
apparatus and the receiver apparatus carries out sending<br>
 <br>
of a reply of the ACK/NACK utilizing the instructed<br>
frequency band. Therefore, if the sender apparatus<br>
receives the ACK/NACK signal, then it can analyze the<br>
frequency band of the signal to identify to which antenna<br>
system the ACK/NACK corresponds. On the other hand,<br>
"addition" of an antenna identifier signifies that an<br>
antenna identifier is added explicitly to the ACK/NACK<br>
signal exactly as illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
[0083]<br>
For example, taking notice of the process "0-2" in<br>
FIG. 5 sent from the antenna system 7x#l (main antenna<br>
system is Tx#2) of the sender apparatus 1 after transmission<br>
mode changeover occurs, the receiver apparatus 2 produces<br>
a signal to which the antenna identifier "0" which is (part<br>
of) a number element of the received process "0-2" is added<br>
as an acknowledgment signal to the process "0-2" by means<br>
of the ACK/NACK decision section 2 4 and sends the produced<br>
signal as a reply to the sender apparatus 1.<br>
[0084]<br>
Consequently, as a premise that synchronism with<br>
the receiver apparatus 2 is achieved at least regarding<br>
a reply sending timing of the acknowledgment signal to<br>
the sent process (in particular, the sender apparatus 1<br>
receives the acknowledgment signal through timing<br>
adjustment with the receiver apparatus 2) , the sender<br>
apparatus 1 can recognize that the sent acknowledgment<br>
signal corresponds to the process "0-2" by means of the<br>
 <br>
re-sending controlling section 16 and can correctly<br>
re-send the process "0-2" from the main antenna system<br>
Tx#2 without re-sending in error of the process "1-2".<br>
[0085]<br>
It is to be noted that, where the sender apparatus<br>
1 carries out sending and reception of a process with the<br>
antenna identifier omitted as described above (in<br>
particular, where all of processes to be sent from the<br>
antenna systems other than the main antenna system Tx#2<br>
can be transmitted), even if a reply of the acknowledgment<br>
is sent with the antenna identifier omitted, since the<br>
timing adjustment is carried cut, the sender apparatus<br>
1	can identify to which process the acknowledgment signal<br>
corresponds.<br>
[0086]<br>
An operation flow chart of the receiver apparatus<br>
2	in the present case 1 is depicted in FIG. 6.<br>
In particular, the receiver apparatus 2 monitors<br>
and decides whether or not a transmission mode changeover<br>
(change to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (step<br>
S21) , and if a transmission mode changeover does not occur<br>
(in case of no at step S21), then the ACK/NACK decision<br>
section 24 produces an acknowledgment signal to which an<br>
antenna identifier which is a number element of the received<br>
process is added and sends the produced signal as a reply<br>
to the sender apparatus 1. Further, if the acknowledgment<br>
signal is the NACK signal, then the HARQ reception<br>
 <br>
processing section 22 retains the received process in<br>
preparation for the re-sending synthesis (step S22).<br>
[0087]<br>
On the other hand, if a transmission mode changeover<br>
occurs (in case of yes at step S21), then the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 carries out separation of the received process<br>
(identification of the process number) by means of the<br>
process distribution section 26 (step 323) and decides<br>
whether or not an antenna identifier is added (step S24) .<br>
As a result, if an antenna identifier is added (in case<br>
of yes at step S24) , then the receiver apparatus 2 produces<br>
an acknowledgment signal to which the antenna identifier<br>
which is a number element of the received process is added<br>
and sends the produced signal as a reply to the sender<br>
apparatus 1 similarly as in the case at step S22, and,<br>
if the produced acknowledgment signal is the NACK signal,<br>
then the HARQ reception processing section 22 retains the<br>
received process in preparation for the re-sending<br>
synthesis (step S25).<br>
[0088]<br>
On the other hand, if an antenna identifier is not<br>
added (in case of no at step 324), then since timing<br>
adjustment is carried out, the receiver apparatus 2 sends<br>
a reply of the acknowledgment to the sender apparatus 1<br>
with the antenna identifier omitted, and, if the<br>
acknowledgment signal is the NACK signal, then the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
 <br>
process in preparation for the re-sending synthesis (step<br>
S26) .<br>
[0089]<br>
In this manner, in the present case 1, if a<br>
transmission mode changeover (change to the MIMO diversity<br>
transmission) occurs and each sending process needs to<br>
be identified among the antenna systems Tx#i (Rx#i), then<br>
only the antenna identifier which is an information element<br>
of the received process number is added to the<br>
acknowledgment signal and the produced signal is sent as<br>
a reply to the sender apparatus 1 while suppressing the<br>
information amount thereof to a minimum, but, if ail of<br>
the processes to be sent from the antenna systems other<br>
than the main antenna system Tx#2 can be transmitted and<br>
each transmission process does not need to be identified<br>
between the antenna systems Tx#i (Rx#i), then addition<br>
of the antenna identifier is omitted. Therefore,<br>
effective utilization of wireless resources between the<br>
sender apparatus 1 and the receiver apparatus 2 can be<br>
achieved.<br>
[0090]<br>
(Case 2) Where the ACK/NACK signal is sent as a reply<br>
with a process number added explicitly (FIGS. 7 and S)<br>
A diagram of a concept in the present case<br>
corresponding to FIGS. 3 and 5 is depicted in FIG. 7. As<br>
seen in FIG. 7, even after a transmission mode changeover<br>
(change to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (refer<br>
 <br>
to reference numeral 500), since timing adjustment is not<br>
established between the sender apparatus and the receiver<br>
apparatus, the receiver apparatus 2 sends the ACK/NACK<br>
as a reply with a process number added explicitly.<br>
[0091]<br>
For example, also in the present case 2 , taking notice<br>
of the process "0-2" sent from the antenna system Tx#l<br>
(main antenna system is Tx#2) of the sender apparatus 1<br>
after a transmission mode changeover occurs in FIG. 7,<br>
the receiver apparatus 2 produces a signal to which the<br>
process number of the received process "0-2" is added as<br>
an acknowledgment signal with regard to the process "0-2"<br>
by means of the ACK/NACK decision section 24 and sends<br>
the produced signal as a reply to the sender apparatus<br>
1.<br>
[0092]<br>
Consequently, the sender apparatus 1 can identify<br>
to which process cf which antenna system Tx#i the<br>
acknowledgment signal is a reply (in the present example,<br>
to the process "0-2") by means of the re-sending controlling<br>
section 16 irrespective of whether or not the synchronism<br>
with the receiver apparatus 2 is established regarding<br>
a reply sending timing of the acknowledgment signal to<br>
the sending process, and the process "0-2" can be correctly<br>
re-sent from the main antenna system Tx#2 without<br>
re-sending in error of the process "1-2".<br>
[0093]<br>
 <br>
An operation flow chart of the receiver apparatus<br>
2 in the present case 2 is depicted in FIG. 8.<br>
In particular, the receiver apparatus 2 monitors<br>
and decides whether or not a transmission mode changeover<br>
(change to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (step<br>
S31), and, if a transmission mode changeover does not occur<br>
(in case of no at step 331), then the ACK/NACK decision<br>
section 24 produces an acknowledgment signal to which a<br>
received process number is added and sends the produced<br>
signal as a reply to the sender apparatus 1. Further, where<br>
the acknowledgment signal is the NACK signal, the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation for the re-sending synthesis (step<br>
332) .<br>
[0094]<br>
On the other hand, if a transmission mode changeover<br>
occurs (in case of yes at step S31), then the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 carries out separation of the received process<br>
(identification of the process number) by means of the<br>
process distribution section 26 (step S33) and decides<br>
whether or not an antenna identifier is added (step S34) .<br>
As a result, if an antenna identifier is added (in case<br>
of yes at step S34), then the receiver apparatus 2 adds<br>
the received process number to an acknowledgment signal<br>
and sends the acknowledgment signal as a reply to the sender<br>
apparatus 1 similarly as in the case at step S32, and,<br>
if the acknowledgment signal is the NACK signal, then the<br>
 <br>
HARQ reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation for the re-sending synthesis (step<br>
S35)	.<br>
[0035]<br>
On the other hand, if an antenna identifier is not<br>
added (in case of no at step S34), that is, if the sender<br>
apparatus 1 can transmit all of the processes to be sent<br>
from the antenna systems other than the main antenna system<br>
Tx#i and carries out sending and reception of a process<br>
with the antenna identifier omitted, then since addition<br>
of an antenna identifier can be omitted, the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 sends the acknowledgment signal as a reply<br>
to the sender apparatus 1 utilizing the number of the main<br>
antenna system Tx#2 (process number similar to that of<br>
the conventional method wherein the antenna identifier<br>
is omitted) without adding the antenna identifier, and,<br>
if the acknowledgment signal is the NACK signal, then the<br>
HARQ reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation for the re-sending synthesis (step<br>
536)	.<br>
[0096]<br>
In this manner, in the present case 2, if a<br>
transmission mode changeover (change to the MIMO diversity<br>
transmission) occurs and each sending process needs to<br>
be identified among the antenna systems Tx#i (Rx#i), then<br>
since an acknowledgment signal is sent as a reply to the<br>
sender apparatus 1 with a received process number added,<br>
 <br>
even if synchronism with the receiver apparatus 2 is not<br>
established regarding a reply sending timing of the<br>
acknowledgment signal to the sending process, the sender<br>
apparatus 1 can correctly identify the process to be re-sent<br>
and re-sending in error of the re-sent process can be<br>
suppressed with certainty.<br>
[0097]<br>
Further, also in the present case 2, if all of the<br>
processes to be sent from the antenna systems other than<br>
the main antenna system Tx#2 can be transmitted and the<br>
sending antenna does not need to be identified among the<br>
antenna systems Tx#i (Rx#i), then since addition of the<br>
sending antenna is omitted, also effective utilization<br>
of wireless resources between the sender apparatus 1 and<br>
the receiver apparatus 2 can be achieved.<br>
[0093]<br>
[B] Description of Second Embodiment<br>
FIG. 9 is a block diagram depicting a configuration<br>
of a MIMO transmission system according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention and corresponding to<br>
FIG. 2. The MIMO transmission system (sender apparatus<br>
1 and receiver apparatus 2) depicted in FIG. 9 is different<br>
in comparison with the configuration depicted in FIGS.<br>
1 and 2 in that it includes a process number addition section<br>
17A and a process distribution section 26A in place of<br>
the process number addition section 17 and the process<br>
distribution section 26 described hereinabove. It is to<br>
 <br>
be noted that the configuration of the other part is same<br>
as or similar to that described hereinabove with reference<br>
to FIGS, 1 and 2, and in FIG. 9, seme of the components<br>
of the sender apparatus 1 (stream separation section 11,<br>
CRC calculation section 12 and coding section 13) and some<br>
of the components of the receiver apparatus 2 (CRC<br>
calculation section 22 and stream synthesis section 25)<br>
are not depicted.<br>
1 C 0 9 9 ]<br>
Here, the process number addition section 17A in<br>
the present embodiment independently adds a process number<br>
to a HARQ block (process) obtained by the HARQ sending<br>
processing section 14 such that it is not competitive among<br>
all of the antenna systems Tx#i. For example, addition<br>
methods described in (1) and (2) given below are available .<br>
[ C10 0 ]<br>
(1) A method wherein, as seen in FIG. 9, process<br>
numbers are successively added in an ascending order (or<br>
may be added in the descending order) from the antenna<br>
system Tx#l to the antenna system Tx#n and, after a process<br>
number for a stream of the last antenna system Tx#n is<br>
determined, the process numbers are successively added<br>
in the ascending order again beginning with the first<br>
antenna system Tx#l. In short, a method wherein a series<br>
of process numbers are added repetitively to all of the<br>
antenna systems Tx#i. For example, the process number<br>
regarding the antenna system Tx#l is, in a representation<br>
 <br>
of a bit train, "...00000"; the process number regarding<br>
the antenna system Tx#n is "...0 0111"; the succeeding process<br>
number of the antenna system Tx#l is "...01000"; and the<br>
succeeding process number cf the antenna system Tx#n is<br>
"...01111".<br>
[0101]<br>
(2) A method wherein, as seen in FIG. 10, a series<br>
of process numbers which are independent of each ether<br>
(are not competitive with each other) for each antenna<br>
system Tx#i are successively added in the ascending order<br>
(or may be added in the descending order). For example,<br>
the process numbers for the antenna system Tx#l are "...00000<br>
~ ...C0111"; the process numbers for the antenna system Tx#2<br>
are "...01000 ~ ... 01111"; and the process numbers for the<br>
antenna system Tx#3 are "...10000 ~ ...11111".<br>
In other words, the process number addition section<br>
(controlling means) 17A in the present embodiment has also<br>
a function as a group-based number production section which<br>
divides information of a series of numbers into groups<br>
for each stream and provides the number information in<br>
a corresponding group as the process number (data block<br>
identification information) to be added to the sending<br>
process for each of the streams to the HARQ sending<br>
processing section 14 in order to implement addition<br>
control of a process number "which is not competitive among<br>
different streams, which is similar to that in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
 <br>
[0102]<br>
It is to be noted that, in both of the cases of (1)<br>
and (2) given above, in order to avoid a subject similar<br>
to that of the first embodiment, it is necessary to share<br>
an addition method of a process number between the sender<br>
apparatus 1 and the receiver apparatus 2.<br>
In particular, for the process number identification,<br>
process numbers and an addition method of the process<br>
numbers used in the process number addition section 17A<br>
are stored in advance in a memory or the like not depicted<br>
in the process distribution section 26A of the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 and an addition method for a process number<br>
is shared between the sender apparatus 1 and the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 in advance. Consequently, the process<br>
distribution section 2 6A can identify the process number<br>
of a received process and control the signal separation<br>
and synthesis process by the signal separation and<br>
synthesis section 21 so that the received process is<br>
distributed and inputted to one of the HARQ reception<br>
processing sections 22 based on the identified process<br>
number.<br>
[0103]<br>
In the following, operation of the MIMO transmission<br>
system of the present embodiment configured in such a manner<br>
as described above is described with additional reference<br>
to FIGS. 11 to 14.<br>
First, in the sender apparatus 1, sending data are<br>
 <br>
separated ir.to sending streams for the antenna systems<br>
Tx#i by the stream separation section 11, and CRC codes<br>
are added to the sending streams by the corresponding CRC<br>
addition sections 12, whereafter the sending streams are<br>
coded into required error correction codes such as turbo<br>
codes by the coding sections 13 and then inputted to the<br>
HARQ sending processing sections 14.<br>
[0104]<br>
In the HARQ sending processing sections 14, the<br>
sending streams inputted from the coding sections 13 are<br>
subjected to a HARQ process (converted into blocks), and<br>
process numbers provided from the process number addition<br>
section 17A and non-competitive among the antenna systems<br>
Tx#i as depicted in FIG. 9 or 10 are added to the HARQ<br>
blocks (step S41 of FIG. 12). Then, the HARQ blocks<br>
(processes) are stored in preparation for re-sending<br>
control and are transferred to the sending section 15.<br>
[0105]<br>
Consequently, the sending section 15 carries out<br>
the wireless sending process described hereinabove for<br>
each of the processes inputted from the HARQ sending<br>
processing sections 14 and sends the resulting process<br>
from one of the antenna systems Tx#i to the receiver<br>
apparatus 2. FIG. 11 illustrates a concept of a manner<br>
in this instance . FIG. 11 is a view corresponding to FIG. 3<br>
in the first embodiment and illustrates the manner where<br>
the antenna system for both of sending and reception are<br>
 <br>
n = 2 and besides the addition method illustrated in FIG. 9<br>
is applied. In FIG. 11, a manner is illustrated wherein,<br>
to processes to be sent from the antenna system Tx#l,<br>
even-numbered process numbers of "0", "2", "4", ... are<br>
successively added while, to processes to be sent from<br>
the antenna system Tx#2, odd-numbered process numbers of<br>
"1", "3", "5", ... are successively added independently of<br>
(so as not to be competitive with) the process numbers<br>
regarding the antenna system Tx#l and the processes having<br>
the processes numbers added thereto are sent to the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 (refer to solid line arrow marks directed<br>
downwardly on the plane of FIG. 9).<br>
[0106]<br>
It is to be noted that, also in the present embodiment,<br>
also after the number of used antenna system decreases<br>
as in a case wherein a transmission mode changeover occurs<br>
(refer to reference numeral 500 in FIG. 11), the sender<br>
apparatus 1 maintains the addition method of a process<br>
number by means of the process number addition section<br>
17A in a similar manner as described above to carry out<br>
stream sending.<br>
[0107]<br>
In the receiver apparatus 2, for example, in the<br>
case of FIG. 11, the process "4" and the process "5" are<br>
received, and the process numbers of them are identified<br>
and the processes can be distributed to correct antenna<br>
systems Rx#i by the process distribution section 26A.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, even if a transmission mode changeover occurs,<br>
the HARQ reception processing section 22 can carry out<br>
correct synthesis of the processes, that is, synthesis<br>
of the processes of the same process number . In other words ,<br>
degradation of the matching property of synthesis can be<br>
prevented (the subject 1 described hereinabove can be<br>
solved).<br>
[0108]<br>
Further, also in the present embodiment, by<br>
contriving the replying method of the ACK/NACK in such<br>
a manner as described in cases 1 and 2 given below, also<br>
the subject 2 described hereinabove, that is, the subject<br>
that re-sending in error of a process occurs with the sender<br>
apparatus 1 and a process which should originally be re-sent<br>
cannot be re-sent, can be solved.<br>
[0109]<br>
(Case 1) Where ACT/NACK signal is received by timing<br>
adjustment (FIG. 13)<br>
Even after a transmission mode changeover (change<br>
to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (refer to<br>
reference numeral 500 in FIG. 11) , the receiver apparatus<br>
2 carries out reply of an acknowledgement signal (ACK/NACK)<br>
utilizing (adding) the antenna identifier of each antenna<br>
system similarly as in the first embodiment. Here, to<br>
"utilize" and "add" an antenna identifier signifies<br>
similarly as in the first embodiment.<br>
[0110]<br>
 <br>
It is to be noted that, after the transmission mode<br>
changes over to the MIMO diversity, in the first embodiment,<br>
if a process number to which an antenna identifier is not<br>
added is received by the receiver apparatus, then this<br>
signifies that a process is thereafter sent only from the<br>
main antenna system. In the second embodiment, since no<br>
antenna identifier is added to an access number received,<br>
if a certain time period (T) elapses, then the sender<br>
apparatus 1 thereafter sends a process only from the main<br>
antenna system (in the case of FIG. 11, the antenna system<br>
Tx#2). Therefore, after the time period T elapses, the<br>
receiver apparatus 2 can omit an antenna identifier in<br>
reply of an acknowledgement and can send an acknowledge<br>
signal as a reply to the sender apparatus 1 using only<br>
the timing information of the main antenna system.<br>
[0111]<br>
An operation flow chart of the receiver apparatus<br>
2 in the presence case 1 is depicted in FIG. 13.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 13, the receiver apparatus<br>
2 monitors and decides whether or not a transmission mode<br>
changeover (change to the MIMO diversity transmission}<br>
occurs (step S51). If a transmission mode changeover does<br>
not occur (in case of no at step S51) , then the ACK/NACK<br>
decision section 24 produces an acknowledge signal which<br>
utilizes an antenna identifier (has an antenna identifier<br>
added thereto) and sends the acknowledgement signal as<br>
a reply to the sender apparatus 1. Further, if the<br>
 <br>
acknowledgement signal is the NACK signal, then the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation for re-sending synthesis (step<br>
S52) .<br>
[0112]<br>
On the other hand, if a transmission mode changeover<br>
occurs (in case of yes at step S51) , the receiver apparatus<br>
2 carries out separation of a received process<br>
(identification of a process number) by means of the process<br>
distribution section 2 6A (step S53), and decides whether<br>
or not the time period T elapses (step S54) . As a result,<br>
if the time period T does not elapse (in case of no at<br>
step S54), then the receiver apparatus 2 produces an<br>
acknowledgement signal which utilizes the antenna<br>
identifier (has the antenna identifier added thereto) and<br>
sends the acknowledgement signal as a reply to the sender<br>
apparatus 1 similarly as at step S52. Further, if the<br>
acknowledgement signal is the NACK signal, then the HARQ<br>
reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation for re-sending synthesis (step<br>
S55) .<br>
[0113]<br>
On the other hand, if the time period T elapses (in<br>
case of yes at step S54), then the receiver apparatus 2<br>
utilizes the timing information of the main antenna system<br>
to send the acknowledgement signal to the sender apparatus<br>
1. Further, if the acknowledgement signal is the NACK<br>
 <br>
signal, then the HARQ reception processing section 22<br>
retains the received process in preparation for re-sending<br>
synthesis (step 356).<br>
[0114]<br>
In this manner, also in the present case 1, as far<br>
as a transmission mode changeover (change to the MIMO<br>
diversity transmission) occurs and it: is necessary to<br>
identify each transmission process among the antenna<br>
systems Tx#i (Rx#i), each antenna identifier is utilized<br>
(added) to send an acknowledgement signal as a reply to<br>
the sender apparatus 1. Then, if all of the processes other<br>
than those by the main antenna system Tx#2 are transmitted<br>
successfully and it becomes necessary to identify each<br>
sending process among the antenna systems Tx#i (Rx#i),<br>
then only the timing information of the main antenna system<br>
can be utilized to send an acknowledgement as a reply,<br>
and therefore, effective utilization of wireless resources<br>
between the sender apparatus 1 and the receiver apparatus<br>
2 can be anticipated.<br>
[0115]<br>
(Case 2) where ACK/NACK signal is sent as reply with<br>
process number added explicitly (FIG. 14)<br>
Even if a transmission mode changeover (change to<br>
the MINiO diversity transmission) occurs (refer to<br>
reference numeral 500 in FIC. 11) , the receiver apparatus<br>
2 sends the ACK/NACK as a reply with a process number added<br>
explicitly. For example, if attention is paid to the<br>
 <br>
Process "4" in FIG. 11 sent from the antenna system Tx#l<br>
(the main antenna system is Tx#2) of the sender apparatus<br>
1 after occurrence of the transmission mode changeover,<br>
then the receiver apparatus 2 produces, as an<br>
acknowledgement signal with regard to the process "4",<br>
a signal to which the process number of the received process<br>
"4" is added by means of the ACK/NACK decision section<br>
24 and sends the acknowledgement signal as a reply to the<br>
sender apparatus 1.<br>
[0116]<br>
Consequently, the sender apparatus 1 can identify<br>
a reply to which process of which antenna system Tx#i (in<br>
the present example, a reply to the process "4") the<br>
acknowledgement signal is by means of the re-sending<br>
controlling section 16. Thus, the sender apparatus 1 can<br>
re-send the process "4" correctly from the main antenna<br>
system Tx#2 without re-sending the process "5" in error.<br>
[0117]<br>
It is to be noted that, also in the present case<br>
2, although the sender apparatus 1 can transmit a process<br>
only from the main antenna system if a certain time period<br>
(T) elapses after occurrence of a transmission mode<br>
changeover, after lapse of the 7 time period, the sender<br>
apparatus 2 cannot send a process with a process number<br>
omitted. In the present case 2, even if the certain time<br>
period (T) elapses after occurrence of a transmission mode<br>
changeover and the sender apparatus thereafter transmits<br>
 <br>
a process only from the main antenna system, since,<br>
different from the case 1, timing synchronism is not<br>
established, it is necessary to send an acknowledgement<br>
with a process number added.<br>
[0118]<br>
FIG. 14 illustrates an operation flow chart of the<br>
receiver apparatus 2 in the present case 2.<br>
In particular, the receiver apparatus 2 monitors<br>
and decides whether or not a transmission mode changeover<br>
(change to the MIMO diversity transmission) occurs (step<br>
S61)	, and if a transmission mode changeover does not occur<br>
(in case of no at step S61), then the ACK/NACK decision<br>
section 24 produces an acknowledgement signal with a<br>
received process number added and transmits the produced<br>
acknowledgement signal to the sender apparatus 1. Further,<br>
where the acknowledgement signal is the NACK signal, the<br>
HARQ reception processing section 22 retains the received<br>
process in preparation fcr re-sending synthesis (step<br>
S62)	.<br>
[0119]<br>
On the other hand, if a transmission mode changeover<br>
occurs (in case of yes at step S61), then the process<br>
distribution section 26A carries out separation of a<br>
received process (identification of the access number}<br>
(step 363) and produces and sends an acknowledgement signal<br>
with the received process number added as a reply to the<br>
sender apparatus 1 irrespective of whether or not the T<br>
 <br>
time period elapses. Further, if the acknowledgement<br>
signal is the NACK signal, then the HARQ reception<br>
processing section 22 retains the received process in<br>
preparation for re-sending synthesis (step S66).<br>
[0120]<br>
In this manner, in the present case 2, as far as<br>
a transmission mode changeover (change to the MIMO<br>
diversity transmission) occurs and it is necessary to<br>
identify each transmission process among the antenna<br>
systems Tx#i (Rx#i), an acknowledgement signal to which<br>
the received process number is added is sent as a reply<br>
to the sender apparatus 1. Therefore, even if the sender<br>
apparatus 1 is not in a synchronized state with the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 in regard to the sending timing of an<br>
acknowledgement signal to a sending process, the sender<br>
apparatus 1 can correctly identify a process to be re-sent<br>
and can suppress re-sending in error of a re-sending process<br>
with certainty.<br>
[0121]<br>
[C] Description of Third Embodiment<br>
The first and second embodiments described above<br>
demonstrate that, by setting an addition method of a process<br>
number such that a process number may not be competitive<br>
between antenna system, also when the transmission mode<br>
changes over from the MIMO multiplex transmission to<br>
non-MIMO multiplex transmission, correct synthesis of<br>
processes can be achieved and transmission of streams can<br>
 <br>
be continued without interruption while preventing<br>
re-sending in error of a process. However, the present<br>
embodiment demonstrates a technique of continuing<br>
communication without interruption of stream transmission<br>
also in conventional PARC or pre-coding wherein a process<br>
number is added to a transmission stream independently<br>
for each antenna system.<br>
[0122]<br>
In the present embodiment, attention is paid to the<br>
fact that, originally upon occurrence of a transmission<br>
mode changeover, re-sending in error is caused by the fact<br>
that a process remains in an antenna system other than<br>
the main antenna system. Therefore, in order to prevent<br>
re-sending in error, when the transmission mode changes<br>
over from the MIMO multiplex transmission, for example,<br>
to the MIMO diversity transmission, the timing of the<br>
changeover 'reduction control of the stream number) is<br>
delayed in response to the process (non-sent process)<br>
amount remaining in the antenna systems other than the<br>
main antenna system (for example, the changeover is carried<br>
out after transmission of all of the remaining processes<br>
ends).<br>
[0123]<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates a mannerof communication between<br>
the sender apparatus 1 and the receiver apparatus 2 where<br>
this method is applied. In FIGS. 5, 7 and 11, if movement<br>
of the receiver apparatus 2 from a MIMO multiplex<br>
 <br>
transmission area 302 (refertoFIG. 26) to another r.on-MIMO<br>
multiplex transmission area (MIMO diversity area) 301 or<br>
303 is detected, then the sender apparatus 1 immediately<br>
carries out changeover to the MIMO diversity transmission<br>
(refer to reference numeral 500).<br>
[0124]<br>
On the other hand, in FIG. 15, ever, if the movement<br>
(area change) isdetectedat a timing indicated by reference<br>
numeral 600, since the remaining process "2" exists for<br>
the antenna system Tx#l at this point of time, the sender<br>
apparatus 1 continues the MIMO multiplex transmission,<br>
but the sender apparatus 1 actually changes over the<br>
transmission mode from the MIMO multiplex transmission<br>
to the MIMO diversity transmission only after the<br>
transmission of the remaining process "2" ends (for example,<br>
at a timing indicated by reference numeral 700).<br>
Consequently, even if such a special process number<br>
addition method as in the first embodiment or the second<br>
embodiment is not applied, communication can be continued<br>
by simple and easy control without interruption of stream<br>
transmission upon occurrence of a mode changeover.<br>
[0125]<br>
It is to be noted, however, that, with the present<br>
method, the transmission mode cannot be changed over to<br>
the MIMO diversity until after re-sending of the remaining<br>
process "2" is completed successfully. Therefore, for<br>
example, as illustrated in FIG. 16, separately from the<br>
 <br>
changeover threshold value for the MIMO diversity<br>
transmission (threshold value A for the wireless quality) ,<br>
a threshold value for changing over the transmission mode<br>
to the MIMO diversity even if a remaining process exists<br>
(threshold value 3 regarding the wireless quality 
is provided. Then, where the wireless quality of the<br>
receiver apparatus (mobile station.) 2 has a value between<br>
the threshold value A and the threshold value B, if a<br>
remaining process exists, then the sender apparatus 1<br>
continues the MIMO multiplex transmission, but where the<br>
wireless quality is lower than the threshold value 3, the<br>
sender apparatus 1 changes over the transmission mode to<br>
the MIMO diversity transmission.<br>
[0126]<br>
It is to be noted that the function described above<br>
can be incorporated, for example, as one function of the<br>
re-sending controlling section 16 described hereinabove<br>
and also can be incorporated as an individual controlling<br>
section (transmission mode changeover timing controlling<br>
section). Further, it is possible to allow the sender<br>
apparatus 1 to grasp the wireless quality of the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 making use of a known method such as, for example,<br>
a method of feeding back reception quality information<br>
such as the SIR, CQI or the like measured by the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 (this similarly applies also in the following<br>
description).<br>
[0127]<br>
 <br>
[D] Description of Fourth Embodiment<br>
Here, a different method of continuing stream<br>
transmission without interruption even in the conventional<br>
PARC wherein a process number is applied to a sending stream<br>
independently for each antenna system is described.<br>
[0128]<br>
Also in the present embodiment 4, attention is paid<br>
to the fact that, upon occurrence of a transmission mode<br>
changeover, re-sending in error is caused by the fact that<br>
a process remains in an antenna system other than the main<br>
antenna system similarly as in the third embodiment. In<br>
particular, when, upon mode changeover from the MIMO<br>
multiplex transmission to non-MIMO multiplex transmission<br>
(MIMO diversity transmission), where, although the<br>
wireless quality of the receiver apparatus 2 is higher<br>
than a threshold value for changeover (threshold value<br>
A) , it is lower than another threshold value (threshold<br>
value C) (that is, the threshold value C&gt; threshold value<br>
A &gt; threshold value B) and besides sending data (process)<br>
does not exist in the antenna system other than the main<br>
antenna system, the sender apparatus 1 does not wait that<br>
the wireless quality becomes lower than the threshold value<br>
A but changes over the transmission mode to the MIMO<br>
diversity transmission at a later point of time.<br>
[0129]<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates an example of setting of the<br>
threshold values A and C. Meanwhile, FIG. 18 illustrates<br>
 <br>
a manner of communication between the sender apparatus<br>
1 and the receiver apparatus 2 where the method of the<br>
present embodiment is applied.<br>
In FIG. 18, a manner is illustrated wherein, since<br>
the sender apparatus 1 receives a NACK signal (refer to<br>
a broken line arrow mark 610) with regard to the process<br>
"2" of the antenna system Tx#l after movement of the receiver<br>
apparatus 2 from a MIMO multiplex transmission area to<br>
a non-MIMO multiplex transmission area (MIMO diversity-<br>
area) is detected (refer to reference numeral 600),<br>
re-sending of the process "2" occurs and, immediately after<br>
an ACK signal (refer to a solid line arrow mark 620) to<br>
the re-sending process, all remaining processes of the<br>
antenna system 7x#l are transmitted. If the wireless<br>
quality of the receiver apparatus 2 has a value between<br>
the threshold value A and the threshold value C after a<br>
point of time at which the remaining processes disappear<br>
in this manner, then the transmission mode can be changed<br>
over immediately to the MIMO diversity transmission at<br>
a timing indicated by reference numeral 700.<br>
[0130]<br>
It is to be noted that also the function described<br>
above can be incorporated, for example, as one function<br>
of the re-sending controlling section 16 described<br>
hereinabove and also can be incorporated as an individual<br>
controlling section (transmission mode changeover timing<br>
controlling section). Further, the threshold value A,<br>
 <br>
threshold value B and threshold value C described above<br>
may be set simultaneously as far as the relationship of<br>
the threshold value C &gt; threshold value A &gt; threshold value<br>
3 is satisfied.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0131]<br>
As described in detail above, according to the<br>
present invention, in a radio communication system, even<br>
where the number of transmission streams between a sender<br>
apparatus and a receiver apparatus varies (decreases),<br>
it is possible to maintain the matching property of a data<br>
block of a re-sending synthesis target to continue<br>
communication normally, and therefore, the radio<br>
communication system is very useful in the field of the<br>
radio communication technique.<br>
