BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to methods, compositions and kits for improving the<br>
oral bioavailabiiity of pharmaceutical agents that are poorly absorbed from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, and to methods of treatment of patients through the oral<br>
administration of such agents. One aspect of the invention relates to the use of<br>
cyclosporins to enhance the oral bioavailabiiity of paclitaxel and related taxanes.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Many valuable pharmacologically active compounds cannot be effectively<br>
administered by the oral route because of poor systemic absorption from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract. All these pharmaceutical agents are, therefore, generally<br>
administered via intravenous or intramuscular routes, requiring intervention by a<br>
physician or other health care professional, entailing considerable discomfort and<br>
potential local trauma to the patient and even requiring administration in a hospital<br>
setting with surgical access in the case of certain IV infusions.<br>
It has been speculated that, in some cases, the poor bioavailability of a<br>
drug after oral administration is a result of the activity of a multidrug transporter, a<br>
membrane-bound P-glycoprotein, which functions as an energy-dependent transport or<br>
efflux pump to decrease intracellular accumulation of drug by extruding xenobiotics<br>
from the cell. This P-glycoprotein has been identified in normal tissues of secretory<br>
endothelium, such as the biliary lining, brush border of the proximal tubule in the kidney<br>
and luminal surface of the intestine, and vascular endothelial cells lining the blood brain<br>
barrier, placenta and testis.<br>
It is believed that the P-glycoprotein efflux pump prevents certain<br>
pharmaceutical compounds from transversing the mucosal cells of the small intestine<br>
and, therefore, from being absorbed into the systemic circulation. A number of known<br>
non-cytotoxic pharmacological agents have been shown to inhibit P-glycoprotein,<br>
including cyclosporin A (also known as cyclosporine), verapamil, tamoxifen, quinidine<br>
and phenothiazines, among others. Many of these studies were aimed at achieving<br>
greater accumulation of cytotoxic drugs inside tumor cells. In fact, clinical trials have<br>
been conducted to study the effects of cyclosporine on the pharmacokinetics and<br>
toxicities of paclitaxel (Fisher et al., Proc, Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol.13: 143, 1994);<br>
doxorubicin (Bartlett et al.. J. Clin. One. 12:835-842. 1994); and etoposide (Lum et al.,<br>
J. Clin. Onc. 10: 1635-42, 1992), all of which are anti-cancer agents known to be subject<br>
to multidrug resistance (MDR). These trials showed that patients receiving intravenous<br>
cyclosporine prior to or together with the anti-cancer drugs had higher blood levels of<br>
those drugs, presumably through reduced body clearance, and exhibited the expected<br>
toxicity at substantially lower dosage levels. These findings tended to indicate that the<br>
concomitant administration of cyclosporine suppressed the MDR action of P-<br>
glycoprotein, enabling larger intracellular accumulations of the therapeutic agents. For<br>
a general discussion of the pharmacologic implications for the clinical use of P-<br>
glycoprotein inhibitors, see Lum et al., Drug Resist. Clin. One. Hemat.. 9: 319-336<br>
(1995); Schinkel et al., Eur. J. Cancer. 31A: 1295-1298 (1995).<br>
In the aforedescribed studies relating to the use of cyclosporine to<br>
increase the blood levels of pharmaceutical agents subject to P-glycoprotein mediated<br>
resistance, the active agents and the cyclosporine were administered intravenously. No<br>
suggestion was made in these publications that cyclosporine or other substances<br>
believed to inhibit the P-glycoprotein efflux pump could be orally administered to<br>
substantially increase the bioavailability of orally administered anti-cancer drugs and<br>
other pharmaceutical agents which are themselves poorly absorbed from the gut<br>
without producing highly toxic side effects. Indeed, in the 1995 review paper cited<br>
above, Lum et al. showed that concomitant IV administration of MDR inhibitors and<br>
chemotherapeutic agents subject to MDR increased toxicity levels and exacerbated the<br>
patients" serious side effects. Schinkel et al. briefly adverted to the fact that MDR1 and<br>
P-glycoprotein are abundant in the mucosal cells of the intestine, and that this may<br>
affect the oral bioavailability of P-glycoprotein substrate drugs, but did not suggest or<br>
imply that the oral administration of MDR suppressing agents could improve the<br>
bioavailability of the orally unavailable agents. Furthermore, like Lum et al., Schinkel et<br>
al. warned that P-glycoprotein inhibitors can dramatically increase toxicity in<br>
chemotherapy patients and should, therefore, be used cautiously.<br>
In an earlier publication, Schinkel et al. showed that absorption of orally<br>
ingested ivermectin was increased in mice homozygous for a disruption of the MDR1 a<br>
gene in comparison with normal mice, demonstrating that P-glycoprotein played a major<br>
role in reducing the bioavailability of this agent (Cell,77. 491-502, 1994). In addition,<br>
this study also showed that the penetration of vinblastine into various tissues was<br>
enhanced in the mutant mice.<br>
None of the published studies provided any regimen for implementing the<br>
effective oral administration of otherwise poorly bioavailable drugs, e.g., indicating the<br>
respective dosage ranges and timing of administration for specific target drugs and<br>
bioavailability-enhancing agents or demonstrating which MDR-inhibiting agents are best<br>
suited for promoting oral absorption of each target drug or class of drugs.<br>
Methods disclosed in the art for increasing gut absorption of drugs that<br>
have until now only been administered parenterally generally focus on the use of<br>
permeation and solubility enhancers as promoting agents, or the co-administration by<br>
intraluminal perfusion in the small intestine or by the intravenous route of P-glycoprotein<br>
inhibitors, e.g., Leu et al., Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol.. 35: 432-436, 1995<br>
(perfusion or IV infusion of quinidine suppresses efflux of etoposide into the lumen of<br>
the G.I. tract from the blood). But these methods suffer from numerous drawbacks.<br>
The solubility and permeability enhancing agents are often either impractical or<br>
ineffective for oral administration in the doses required and may interfere with the<br>
pharmacological activity of the target drug. Parenteral administration of P-glycoprotein<br>
inhibitors in therapeutic (or near-therapeutic) doses into humans can cause severe<br>
clinical consequences. In the case of quinidine, for example, IV administration may<br>
cause arrhythmias, peripheral vasodilation, gastrointestinal upset and the like.<br>
In published PCT application WO 95/20980 (published August 10, 1995)<br>
Benet et al. disclose a purported method for increasing the bioavilability of orally<br>
administered hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds. This method comprises orally<br>
administering such compounds to the patient concurrently with a bioenhancer<br>
comprising an inhibitor of a cytochrome P450 3A enzyme or an inhibitor of<br>
P-glycoprotein-mediated membrane transport. Benet et al., however, provide virtually<br>
no means for identifying which bioavailability enhancing agents will improve the<br>
availability of specific "target" pharmaceutical compounds, nor do they indicate specific<br>
dosage amounts, schedules or regimens for administration of the enhancing or target<br>
agents. In fact, although the Benet application lists dozens of potential enhancers<br>
(P450 3A inhibitors) and target drugs (P450 3A substrates), the only combination of<br>
enhancer and target agent supported by any experimental evidence in the application is<br>
ketoconazole as the enhancer and cyclosporin A as the target drug.<br>
When describing the general characteristics of compounds which can be<br>
used as bioenhancers by reduction of P-glycoprotein transport activity, Benet et al.<br>
indicate that these are hydrophobic compounds which generally, but not necessarily,<br>
comprise two co-planar aromatic rings, a positively charged nitrogen group or a<br>
carbonyl group - a class that includes an enormous number of compounds, most of<br>
which would not provide the desired absorption enhancing activity in the case of<br>
specific target agents. Moreover, the classes of target agents disclosed by Benet et al.<br>
include the great majority of pharmaceutical agents listed in the Physicians" Desk<br>
Reference. These inclusion criteria are of no value to medical practitioners seeking<br>
safe, practical and effective methods of orally administering specific pharmaceutical<br>
agents.<br>
A further deficiency with Benet et al."s disclosure is the standard applied<br>
for determinating as to whether bioavailability of a drug that is poorly absorbed upon<br>
oral administration has been improved. Benet et al. indicate that any P-glycoprotein<br>
inhibiting agent which, when present in the gut at a given concentration,<br>
reduces transmembranal transport of Rhodamine 123 by P-glycoprotein in brush border<br>
membrane vesicles or P-glycoprotein containing cells by 10% or more may be<br>
considered a bioenhancing agent at that concentration and can be used in the practice<br>
of their invention. But an increase of only 10% in absorption from the gut of an<br>
otherwise not absorable agent is inadequate to render the agent therapeutically<br>
valuable for any purpose. Indeed, under guidlines of the Federal Food and Drug<br>
Administration, two pharmaceutical formulations containing the same active ingredient,<br>
but differing in their bioavailability levels by -20%/+25%, are still considered<br>
bioequivalent because for most drugs a -20%/+25% difference in concentration of the<br>
active ingredient in the blood is noj; clinically significant. Approved Drug Products with<br>
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Dept. of HHS, 14th ed. 1994). When the FDA<br>
rules that two pharmaceutical formulations are bioequivalent, physicians and<br>
pharmacists consider them freely substitutable for one another.<br>
In general, Benet et al. provides no teaching that could be followed by<br>
persons skilled in the medical and pharmaceutical arts to identify suitable<br>
bioenhancer/target drug combinations or to design specific treatment regimens and<br>
schedules which would render the target agents therapeutically effective upon oral<br>
administration.<br>
Thus, a safe yet effective method for increasing the systemic availability<br>
upon oral administration of drugs that are currently administered only parenterally<br>
because they are not absorbed sufficiently or consistently when administered by the<br>
oral route is required and has not been provided in the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been discovered and experimentally verified that<br>
certain agents which apparently inhibit P-glycoprotein drug transport activity, particularly<br>
cyclosporins, can be used to increase substantially the oral bioavailability of otherwise<br>
poorly available or non-available pharmaceutical agents, e.g., the anti-cancer drugs<br>
paclitaxel (formerly known as taxol), as well as its analogs and derivatives, and<br>
etoposide.<br>
The present invention relates in one aspect to a method of increasing the<br>
oral bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents that are poorly absorbed or not absorbed at<br>
all from the gastrointestinal tract or gut by pre-administering and/or simultaneously<br>
all from the gastrointestinal tract or gut by pre-administering and/or<br>
simultaneously administering to a subject by the oral route one or a combination<br>
of agents known to be effective in inhibiting the P-glycoprotein drug transport<br>
pump. If pre-administration is used, the bioavailability enhancing agent or agents<br>
must be administered in sufficient quantities and within a short enough time<br>
period before administration of the drug whose bioavailability is to be increased<br>
(the "target drug" or "target agent") so that a sufficient level of the enhancing<br>
agent remains at the site of absorption at the time of administration of the target<br>
agent to effectively inhibit the activity of the P-glycoprotein or other multi-drug<br>
transporter substances.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention pertains to compositions or dosage<br>
forms for oral administration of pharmaceutical agents that were heretofore<br>
available for parental administration only. A third aspect of the invention relates<br>
to the administration of such oral dosage forms or a combination thereof to<br>
patients for treatment of diseases responsive to the active agents contained<br>
therein.<br>
The invention also pertains to pharmaceutical kits comprising one or more<br>
oral dosage forms containing a target agent and one or more oral dosage forms<br>
containing an enhancing agent.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains generally to increasing the oral absorption<br>
and bioavailability upon oral administration of pharmacologically, active agents,<br>
particularly agents that are poorly absorbed or not absorbed at all from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract or gut. The preferred embodiments of the invention pertain to (a) a<br>
method for increasing the oral bioavailability of antitumor agents, in particular paclitaxel<br>
(currently marketed as TAXOL® by Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology Division) and its<br>
derivatives; other taxanes; the semi-synthetic paclitaxel analog docetaxel (N-<br>
debenzoyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-10-deacetyl paclitaxel), produced under the trademark<br>
TAXOTERE® by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer S.A.; and etoposide; (b) dosage forms and kits<br>
for oral administration of antitumor agents and other drugs heretofore administered only<br>
parenterally; and (c) methods of treatment of cancer patients with such oral dosage<br>
forms or combinations thereof.<br>
The phrases "oral bioavailability" and "bioavailability upon oral<br>
administration" as used herein refer to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma<br>
levels) of a given amount of drug administered orally to a patient.<br>
Paclitaxel is a natural diterpene product isolated from the Pacific yew tree<br>
(Taxus brevifolia) It is a member of the taxane family of terpenes. It was first isolated<br>
in 1971 by Wani et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:2325,1971), who characterized its<br>
structure by chemical and X-ray crystallographic methods. One mechanism for its<br>
activity relates to paclitaxel"s capacity to bind tubulin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell<br>
growth. Schiff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. ZI:1561-1565 (1980); Schiff et al.<br>
Nature. 277:665-667 (1979); Kumar, J. Biol. Chem.. 256: 10435-10441 (1981).<br>
Paclitaxel has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of refractory<br>
ovarian cancer in the United States (Markman et al., Yale Journal of Biology and<br>
Medicine. 64:583, 1991; McGuire et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 111:273, 1989). It is<br>
effective for chemotherapy for several types of neoplasms including breast (Hofmes et<br>
al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst.. 83:1797, 1991) and has been approved for treatment of breast<br>
cancer as well. It is a potential candidate for treatment of neoplasms in the skin (Einzig<br>
et al., Proc. Am. Soc. Clin. Oncol., 20:46) and head and neck carcinomas (Forastire et<br>
al. Sem. Oncol.. 2Q:56, 1990). The compound also shows potential for the treatment of<br>
polycystic kidney disease (Woo et al., Nature. 3.68:750, 1994), lung cancer and malaria.<br>
Paclitaxel is only slightly soluble in water and this has created significant<br>
problems in developing suitable injectable and infusion formulations useful for<br>
anticancer chemotherapy. Some formulations of paclitaxel for IV infusion have been<br>
developed utilizing CREMOPHOR EL™ (polyethoxylated castor oil) as the drug carrier<br>
because of paclitaxel"s aqueous insolubility. For example, paclitaxel used in clinical<br>
testing under the aegis of the NCI has been formulated in 50% CREMOPHOR EL™<br>
and 50% dehydrated alcohol. CREMOPHOR EL™ however, when administered<br>
intravenously, is itself toxic and produces vasodilation, labored breathing, lethargy,<br>
hypotension and death in dogs. It is also believed to be responsible for the allergic-type<br>
reactions observed during paclitaxel administration.<br>
In an"attempt to increase paclitaxel"s solubility and to develop more safe<br>
clinical formulations, studies have been directed to synthesizing paclitaxel analogs<br>
where the 2" and/or 7-position is derivatized with groups that would enhance water<br>
solubility. These efforts have yielded prodrug compounds that are more water soluble<br>
than the parent compound and that display the cytotoxic properties upon activation.<br>
One important group of such prodrugs includes the 2"-onium salts of paclitaxel and<br>
docetaxel, particularly the 2"-methylpyridinium mesylate (2"-MPM) salts.<br>
Paclitaxel is very poorly absorbed when administered orally (less than<br>
1%); see Eiseman et al., Second NCI Workshop on Taxol and Taxus (Sept. 1992);<br>
Stuffness et al. in Taxol Science and Applications (CRC Press 1995). Eiseman et al.<br>
indicate that paclitaxel has a bioavailability of 0% upon oral administration, and<br>
Stuffness et al. report that oral dosing with paclitaxel did not seem possible since no<br>
evidence of antitumor activity was found on oral administration up to 160 mg/kg/day.<br>
Moreover, no effective method has been developed to enable the effective<br>
administration of oral paclitaxel (i.e., a method of increasing the oral bioavailability of<br>
paclitaxel) or of other oral taxanes or paclitaxel analogs such as docetaxel which exhibit<br>
antitumor activity. For this reason, paclitaxel has not until now been administered orally<br>
to human patients, and certainly not in the course of treating paclitaxel-responsive<br>
diseases.<br>
Docetaxel has become commercially available as TAXOTERE® in<br>
parenteral form for the treatment of breast cancer. To date no reference has been<br>
made in the scientific literature to oral absorption of docetaxel in animals or patients.<br>
Etoposide is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin and is used in<br>
the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, particularly germ cell cancers (e.g.,<br>
testicular cancers) and small cell lung cancers (Loehrer, Sem. Onc 19, no. 6, supp. 14,<br>
pp. 48-52, 1992). It is available in oral dosage form (VEPESID® capsules, Bristol-Myers<br>
Squibb Oncology) but is not consistently well-absorbed orally (the mean value of oral<br>
bioavailability for etoposide capsules is approximately 50%).<br>
Cyclosporins are a group of nonpolar cyclic oligopeptides (some of which<br>
have immunosuppressant activity) produced by the genus Topycladium, including, e.g.<br>
Topycladium inflatum Gams (formerly designated as Trichoderma polysporum)<br>
Topycladium terricola and other fungi imperfecti. The major component, cyclosporin A<br>
(cyclosporine or CsA), has been identified along with several other lesser metabolites,<br>
for example, cyclosporins B through Z, some of which exhibit substantially less<br>
immunosuppressive activity than cyclosporin A. A number of synthetic and semi-<br>
synthetic analogs have also been prepared. See generally Jegorov et al.,<br>
Phytochemistry. 38: 403-407 (1995). The present invention comprehends natural,<br>
semi-synthetic and synthetic analogs of cyclosporins.<br>
Cyclosporins are neutral, lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides with molecular<br>
weights of about 1200. They are used intravenously or orally as immunosuppressants,<br>
primarily for organ transplantation and certain other conditions. Cyclosporins,<br>
particularly cyclosporine (cyclosporin A), are known inhibitors of the P-glycoprotein<br>
efflux pump, as well as of certain P450 degradative enzymes, but to date no effective<br>
regimens for applying this property clinically have been developed to the point of clinical<br>
and commercial feasibility or regulatory approval.<br>
From a mechanistic point of view, orally administered cyclosporine has the<br>
potential to inhibit the P-glycoprotein pump in the upper small intestine which is the site<br>
at which most drugs are absorbed. With intravenous administration of a drug which is<br>
highly metabolized like cyclosporine, it is not possible for it to appear intact in that<br>
region of the gut where drugs are normally absorbed. After parenteral administration,<br>
cyclosporine is extracted by the liver and enters the bile and gut distal to this area of<br>
optimal absorption. One of the surprising discoveries of the invention is that the<br>
immunosuppression observed with certain cyclosporins is not inextricably linked to<br>
improvement in oral bioavailability of therapeutic agents. Thus, cyclosporin F enhances<br>
the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel even though, according to reports in the literature, it<br>
does not display immunosuppressive activity. Stewart et al., Transplantation<br>
Proceedings. 2Q:(Supp. 3) 989-992 (1988); Granelli-Piperno et al., Transplantation.<br>
46:53S-60S(1988).<br>
Ketoconazole is a widely used antifungal imidazole derivative which has<br>
also been used to some extent in the treatment of prostate carcinoma. Ketoconazole<br>
has been shown, as one of its activities, to reverse MDR in highly resistant human KB<br>
carcinoma cells (Siegsmund et al., J. Urology. 151: 485-491, 1994), but also can inhibit<br>
the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes.<br>
It has now been discovered that many pharmaceutical agents with poor<br>
oral absorption profiles can be effectively administered orally with sufficient systemic<br>
absorption to exhibit therapeutic activity levels when said agents are co-administered<br>
orally with an oral dose of certain cyclosporins or other agents known to inhibit the<br>
multidrug resistance, drug transport activity of the P-glycoprotein intracellular pump, as<br>
well as certain enhancing agents whose ability to inhibit P-glycoprotein transport has<br>
not yet been determined. A further surprising discovery of our invention is that under<br>
some conditions, the oral administration leads to a more favorable pharmacokinetic<br>
profile, better tissue penetration and higher volume of distribution of the target<br>
therapeutic agent.<br>
We have observed in animal studies that certain multidrug resistance<br>
suppressing agents such as cyclosporine and ketoconazole, when administered orally<br>
immediately after and/or before drugs such as paclitaxel and etoposide, increase<br>
absorption of the latter drugs from the gut to an unexpected and surprising degree<br>
resulting in therapeutic levels being achieved. It is not at all clear, however, that these<br>
observed results are due to the suppression of the P-glycoprotein pump.<br>
Another possible explanation for the observed increased bioavailability of<br>
paclitaxel and etoposide is that there may be interaction at the level of the drug<br>
metabolizing enzymes for cyclosporine and paclitaxel. It is known that both agents are<br>
highly metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system (e.g., P-450 3A), which is<br>
concentrated in the liver as well as the small intestine. It is conceivable that<br>
cyclosporine which was administered first may have inhibited these enzymes so that<br>
paclitaxel, which is non-polar and lipophilic, could be absorbed. In the absence of this<br>
local inhibition, paclitaxel would be metabolized to more polar metabolites which would<br>
not transverse the mucosal cells. The failure to demonstrate a pharmacokinetic<br>
interaction between cyclosporin and paclitaxel when cyclosporin was given 3 hr prior to<br>
administration of IV paclitaxel suggests that the site of interaction was the gut lumen.<br>
Even this theoretical explanation does not account for our surprising discovery that<br>
certain P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporins and ketoconazole) increase oral<br>
bioavailability of specific target drugs to a high degree, whereas other agents known to<br>
be active P-glycoprotein inhibitors exhibit little activity as oral absorption enhancers for<br>
the same target drugs.<br>
This theorized inhibition of gut metabolism of the target agent would have<br>
little or no effect in increasing systemic blood levels when the target agent is<br>
administered intravenously. Moreover, since the primary effect of the oral absorption<br>
enhancing agent may be a local effect in the gut lumen, subtherapeutic doses should<br>
be effective in achieving the desired effect. This is an important consideration in the<br>
case of enhancing agents such as cyclosporins which have powerful<br>
immunosuppressant activity and can present toxicity problems if administered at high<br>
dose levels. Our observation that non-immunosuppressive cyclosporins, such as<br>
cyclosporin F, can still function as an oral enhancer is of great clinical value.<br>
It is important to note that while we provide hypotheses as to the<br>
mechanisms of action which underlie our invention, we do not actually know the<br>
mechanism(s) responsible for the surprising findings discussed herein; and this does<br>
not impede one of skill in the art from practicing the invention described.<br>
The method of the invention for increasing the oral bioavailability of a<br>
target therapeutic agent with poor oral bioavailability (average or mean bioavailability<br>
50% or less) comprises the oral administration of an oral absorption or bioavailability<br>
enhancing agent to a mammalian patient (human or animal) simultaneously with, or<br>
prior to, or both simultaneously with and prior to the oral administration to increase the<br>
quantity and duration of absorption of the intact target agent into the bloodstream.<br>
The orally administered enhancing agents which may be used in<br>
accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
Cyclosporins, including cyclosporins A through Z but<br>
particularly cyclosporin A (cyclosporine), cyclosporin F,<br>
cyclosporin D, dihydro cyclosporin A, dihydro cyclosporin C,<br>
acetyl cyclosporin A, PSC-833, SDZ-NIM 8112 (both from<br>
Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp.), and related oligopeptides<br>
produced by species in the genus Topycladium. The<br>
structures of cyclosporins A-Z are described in Table 1<br>
below.<br>
Antifungals - ketoconazole.<br>
Cardiovascular drugs - MS-209 (from BASF), amiodarone,<br>
nifedipine, reserpine, quinidine, nicardipine, ethacrynic acid,<br>
• propafenone, reserpine, amiloride.<br>
Anti-migraine natural products - ergot alkaloids.<br>
Antibiotics - cefoperazone, tetracycline, chloroquine,<br>
fosfomycin.<br>
Antiparasitics - ivermectin.<br>
Multi-drug resistance reversers - VX-710 and VX-853<br>
(Vertex Pharmaceutical Incorporated).<br>
Tyrosirte kinase inhibitors - genistein and related<br>
isoflavonoids, quercetin.<br>
Protein kinase C inhibitors - calphostin.<br>
Apoptosis inducers - ceramides.<br>
2SDZ-NIM 811 is (Me-lle-4)-cyclosporin, an antiviral, non-<br>
immunosuppressive cyclosporin.<br>
Agents active against endorphin receptors - morphine,<br>
morphine congeners, other opioids and opioid antagonists<br>
including (but not limited to) naloxone, naltrexone and<br>
nalmefene).<br>
The class of orally administered target therapeutic agents whose oral<br>
absorption is increased by the enhancing agents includes, but is not limited to, the<br>
following:<br>
Paclitaxel, other taxanes, docetaxel and derivatives and<br>
prodrugs of all of the foregoing, particularly their 2"-MPM<br>
salts and other 2"-methylpyridinium salts.<br>
Other chemotherapeutic agents which have poor or highly<br>
variable oral bioavailability including etoposide,<br>
camptothecin, CPT-11 (Pharmacia and Upjohn), topetecan<br>
(SmithKline Beecham), doxorubicin, vincristine, daunorubicin,<br>
 mitoxantrone and colchicine, all of which are believed to be<br>
affected by the P-glycoprotein efflux.<br>
Other drugs which have not bee.n shown to be handled<br>
by P-glycoprotein but which can be made orally absorbable<br>
in the presence of an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in the gut,<br>
including ganciclovir, foscarnet, camptothecin and<br>
camptothecin derivatives.<br>
The dosage range of the enhancing agent to be co-administered with the<br>
target agent in accordance with the invention is about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg of patient<br>
body weight. "Co-administration" of the enhancing agent comprehends administration<br>
substantially simultaneously with the target agent (either less than 0.5 hr. before, less<br>
than 0.5 hr. after or together), from about 0.5 to about 24 hr. before the administration<br>
of the target agent, or both, i.e., with one or more doses of the same or different<br>
enhancing agents given at least 0.5 hr. before and one dose given substantially<br>
simultaneously with (either together with or immediately before of after) the target<br>
agent. Additionally, "co-administration" comprehends administering more than one<br>
dose of target agent within 24 hrs after a dose of enhancing agent, in other words, the<br>
enhancing agent(s) need not be administered again before or with every administration<br>
of target agent, but may be administered intermittently during the course of treatment.<br>
The dosage range of orally administered target agents will vary from drug<br>
to drug based on its therapeutic index, the requirements of the condition being treated,<br>
the status of the subject and so forth. The method of the invention makes it possible to<br>
administer paclitaxel orally ranging from about 20 mg/m2to about 1000 mg/m2 (based<br>
on patient body surface area) or about 2-30 mg/kg (based on patient body weight) as<br>
single or divided (2-3) daily doses, and maintain the plasma levels of paclitaxel in<br>
humans in the range of 50-500 ng/ml for extended periods of time (e.g., 8-12 hours)<br>
after each oral dose. These levels are at least comparable to those achieved with 96-<br>
hour IV infusion taxol therapy (which causes the patient great inconvenience,<br>
discomfort, loss of time, infection potential, etc.). Moreover, such plasma levels of<br>
paclitaxel are more than sufficient to provide the desired pharmacological activities of<br>
the target drug, e.g., inhibition of tubulin disassembly (which occurs at levels of about<br>
0.1 uM, or about 85 ng/ml) and inhibition of protein isoprenylation (which occurs at<br>
levels of about 0.03 uM, or about 25 ng/ml) which are directly related to its antitumor<br>
effects by inhibiting oncogene functions and other signal-transducing proteins that play<br>
a pivotal role in cell growth regulation.<br>
It may be suitable in some instances to administer to the subject a higher<br>
initial loading dose of the target agent to achieve peak blood levels, followed by lower<br>
maintenance doses.<br>
Two or more different enhancing agents and/or two or more different<br>
target agents may be administered together, alternately or intermittently in all of the<br>
various aspects of the method of the invention.<br>
The present invention also comprehends methods of treating mammalian<br>
patients afflicted with cancers, tumors, Kaposi"s sarcoma, malignancies, uncontrolled<br>
tissue or cellular proliferation secondary to tissue injury, and any other disease<br>
conditions responsive to paclitaxel, taxanes, docetaxel, etoposide, prodrugs and<br>
derivatives of all the foregoing, paclitaxel 2"-MPM, and docetaxel 2"-MPM with orally<br>
administered dosage forms comprising one or more of those agents. Among the types<br>
of carcinoma which may be treated particularly effectively with oral paclitaxel,<br>
docetaxel, other taxanes, and their prodrugs and derivatives, are hepatocellular<br>
carcinoma and liver metastases, and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and<br>
lung. Examples of non-cancerous disease conditions which may be effectively treated<br>
with these active agents administered orally in accordance with the present invention<br>
are uncontrolled tissue or cellular proliferation secondary to tissue injury, polycystic<br>
kidney disease and malaria, including chloroquine- and pyrimethamine-resistant malaria<br>
parasites (Pouvelle et al, J. Clin. Invest., 44: 413-417, 1994).<br>
The antitumor agents which heretofore were administered only<br>
parenterally can now be administered in accordance with the invention by the oral route<br>
with sufficient bioavailability to provide pharmacologically active blood concentrations<br>
which will be particularly effective in the treatment of patients with primary tumors and<br>
metastases. The active ingredients will penetrate the gut wall as a result of the prior<br>
and/or concomitant administration of the MDR inhibitors or other enhancers and will be<br>
taken up by the portal circulation rapidly, providing a higher local initial concentration of<br>
the chemotherapeutic agents in the liver (a far higher local concentration than is<br>
currently achieved with IV infusion therapy) than in the general systemic circulation or in<br>
most other organs at seven days. Furthermore, it should be noted that the higher levels<br>
of paclitaxel in the liver after oral administration may not be reflected in increased<br>
plasma levels because of the high first pass effect of the liver. The method of the<br>
invention, in selectively producing high blood concentrations of antitumor agents, is<br>
particularly valuable in the treatment of liver cancers (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma<br>
and liver metastases), gastrointestinal cancers (e.g., colon, rectal) and lung cancers.<br>
Similarly, after oral administration in accordance with the present<br>
invention higher levels of paclitaxel after twenty-four hours are found (upon tissue<br>
distribution analysis) in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and lung in comparison with<br>
the systemic circulation and most other organs. This fact makes orally administered<br>
paclitaxel of great value in the treatment of cancers of the G.I. tract, pancreas and lung.<br>
FIGS. 21-24 are especially noteworthy and surprising. Our invention, in<br>
certain cases, provides a method for achieving comparable and sometimes higher local<br>
tissue concentrations of paclitaxel via the oral route than the intravenous route. This is<br>
consistent with a higher volume of distribution of the therapeutic agent. Furthermore,<br>
oral administration of an enhancing agent before and immediately after a target agent<br>
has been shown (in the case of cyclosporine and paclitaxel, see FIG. 20) to produce a<br>
higher concentration of the target agent in the urine than even IV administration. This<br>
should make the oral co-administration of enhancing agent with target agent a<br>
treatment of choice in the case of patients with tumors or metastases in the genito-<br>
urinary tract.<br>
Apart from the higher than previously achieved local concentration of the<br>
active ingredients in the liver, the plasma and tissue distribution of the active target<br>
agents administered orally with the appropriate enhancing agents as provided in the<br>
present invention is remarkably and surprisingly similar to that observed upon IV<br>
administration. A series of studies with experimental animals showed that steady state<br>
plasma levels of paclitaxel were achieved upon oral co-administration with CsA by the<br>
third day of the regimen. The levels of the target agent achieved at steady state were<br>
comparable to those achieved in patients by a 96-hour IV infusion of paclitaxel. A 27%<br>
response rate was found in taxane-failure patients with metastatic breast cancer treated<br>
with a continuous 96-hour infusion every three weeks (Seidman et al., J. Clin. Oncol..<br>
14:1877, 1996). It is believed that similar results can be achieved with the treatment<br>
methods of the present invention, without the discomfort, inconvenience and risks of<br>
prolonged IV infusions.<br>
Furthermore, and quite significantly, the elimination-phase concentration<br>
in the blood of paclitaxel and the other antitumor agents listed above, when<br>
administered orally as provided herein, is approximately equal to that achieved with IV<br>
administration, and these high, therapeutically effective levels, can be maintained for as<br>
long as 8-12 hours after each administration. The increase in urinary excretion of drug<br>
after oral administration in the presence of CsA not only supports the enhanced oral<br>
absorption of paclitaxel but also provides more drug being delivered to the genito-<br>
urinary tract for the treatment of cancers.<br>
Oral dosage forms of the target agents whose bioavailability is increased<br>
by the co-administration of the enhancing agents may be in the form of conventional<br>
tablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills, liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions or elixirs),<br>
lozenges and any other oral dosage forms known in the pharmaceutical arts. The liquid<br>
preparations may include, for example, paclitaxel or other taxane in a vehicle<br>
comprising CREMOPHOR EL or other polyethoxylated castor oil, alcohol and/or a<br>
polyoxyethylated sorbitan mono-oleate (e.g., TWEEN® 80, ICI Americas, Inc.). Each<br>
dosage form includes an effective amount of a target agent (for example, effective<br>
antitumor or antineoplastic amounts of an antitumor or antineoplastic agent) and<br>
pharmaceutically inert ingredients, e.g., conventional excipients, vehicles, fillers,<br>
binders, disentegrafits, solvents, solubilizing agents, sweeteners, coloring agents and<br>
any other inactive ingredients which are regularly included in pharmaceutical dosage<br>
forms for oral administration. Many such dosage forms and oral vehicles immediately<br>
after listings of inactive ingredients therefor are set forth in Remington"s Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences. 17th edition (1985). Each dosage form also contains a pharmacologically<br>
effective amount, for example, an effective antineoplastic or tumor-reducing amount, of<br>
one of the target drugs.<br>
Precise amounts of each of the target drugs in the oral dosage forms will<br>
vary depending on the age, weight, disease and condition of the patient. For example,<br>
paclitaxel dosage forms may contain sufficient quantities of paclitaxel to provide a daily<br>
dosage of about 20-1000 mg/m2 (based on patient body surface area) or about 2-30<br>
mg/kg (based on patient body weight) as single or divided (2-3) daily doses. Etoposide<br>
oral dosage forms may contain sufficient quantities of etoposide to provide a daily<br>
dosage of about 20-200 mg/m2 (based on average or median patient body surface<br>
area) as single or divided (2-3) daily doses.<br>
As already indicated, certain of the target agents are commercially<br>
available in oral dosage forms, despite their relatively poor or inconsistent oral<br>
bioavailability. For example, VEPESID® capsules are available containing 50 mg each<br>
of etoposide.<br>
In establishing a treatment regimen for a particular patient treated with the<br>
oral, target drug-containing dosage forms of the invention, it is necessary to take into<br>
account the increased bioavailability provided by the concomitant and/or prior oral<br>
administration of the enhancing agents. For example, although the manufacturer-<br>
recommended dosage amount of VEPESID® capsules in the treatment of small cell lung<br>
cancer is two times the IV dose rounded to the nearest 50 mg, the increased<br>
bioavailability of etoposide provided by pre-and/or substantially simultaneous<br>
administration of enhancing agents such as cyclosporins, allows a considerably lower<br>
dosage of oral etoposide to be used to provide the same effective blood levels of the<br>
drug, with greater duration and stability of action and no increase (and perhaps a<br>
decrease) in toxic side effects. With oral administration one can avoid the high peak<br>
blood levels which are responsible for some of the toxicities. Based on our<br>
experimental data (see FIGS. 18 and 19 and Table 6), which indicate that the oral<br>
absorption of etoposide is essentially complete (about 96%) in the presence of<br>
cyclosporine, the oral daily dosage range for etoposide in the treatment of testicular<br>
cancer should be about 50-100 mg/m2 and in the treatment of small cell lung cancer<br>
about 35-50 mg/m2, based on patient body surface area.<br>
Dosing schedules for the treatment method of the present invention, for<br>
example, the treatment of paclitaxel-responsive diseases with oral paclitaxel dosage<br>
forms co-administered with enhancing agents, can likewise be adjusted to account for<br>
the patient"s characteristics and disease status. Preferred dosing schedules for<br>
administration of oral paclitaxel are (a) the daily administration to a patient in need<br>
thereof of 1-3 equally divided doses providing about 20-1000 mg/m2 (based on body<br>
surface area), with said daily administration being continued for 1-4 consecutive days<br>
each 2-3 weeks, or (b) administration for about one day each week. The former<br>
schedule is comparable to use of a 96-hour paclitaxel infusion every 2-3 weeks, which<br>
is considered by some a preferred IV treatment regimen. A preferred dosing schedule<br>
for oral administration of etoposide co-administered with enhancing agents is the daily<br>
administration to a patient in need thereof of 1-3 equally divided doses providing about<br>
50-100 mg/m2 (based on body surface area) in the treatment of patients with testicular<br>
cancer and about 35-50 mg/m2 as a daily dose in the treatment of small cell lung<br>
cancer, with the daily administration being continued for 5-21 days in each case and<br>
with a period of about 2-3 weeks in between each course of treatment.<br>
Oral administration of powerful chemotherapeutic agents in accordance<br>
with the invention may actually decrease toxic side effects in many cases as compared<br>
with currently utilized IV therapy. Rather than producing a sudden and rapid high<br>
concentration in blood levels as is usually the case with an IV infusion, absorption of the<br>
active agent through the gut wall (promoted by the enhancing agents), provides a more<br>
gradual appearance in the blood levels and a stable, steady-state maintenance of those<br>
levels at or close to the ideal range for a long period of time.<br>
Pursuant to another aspect of the invention, combination oral dosage<br>
forms are provided which contain fixed quantities of at least one enhancing agent and<br>
at least one target agent. For example, such dosage forms can consist of tablets,<br>
capsules, caplets, gelcaps, pills, liquids, lozenges and any other conventional oral<br>
dosage forms containing as active ingredients an effective oral bioavailability enhancing<br>
amount of an antitumor or antiineoplastic agent, as well as suitable inactive ingredients.<br>
One such combination product includes from about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg of one or<br>
more of cyclosporins A, D, C, F and G, dihydro CsA, dihydro CsC and acetyl CsA<br>
together with about 20 to about 1000 mg/m2 (based on average patient body surface<br>
area) of paclitaxel, docetaxel, other taxanes or paclitaxel or docetaxel derivatives such<br>
as paclitaxel 2"- MPM or docetaxel 2- MPM. Another such dosage form includes about<br>
0.1 to about 15 mg/kg of cyclosporine or cyclosporin D or F together with about 20<br>
mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 of etoposide.<br>
The co-administration of enhancing agents with the target drugs promotes<br>
not only the oral bioavailability of those agents but also enables their use in the<br>
treatment of tumors at sites highly protected by MDR, e.g., the testes and the brain.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is, thus, a method of delivering antitumor drugs<br>
to tumor sites protected by MDR through the oral co-administration of enhancing agents<br>
and the antitumor agents, making it possible to treat brain tumors such as glioblastoma<br>
multiforme.<br>
Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of delivering an<br>
active paclitaxel metabolite to a disease site at therapeutic levels to treat paclitaxel-<br>
responsive diseases. The major in vivo metabolites of paclitaxel have been identified,<br>
particularly the following hydroxylated paclitaxel metabolites A, B and C:<br>
In certain in vitro tests metabolite B shown above (also referred to in the<br>
literature as metabolite M4) has been found to have a higher therapeutic index (ratio of<br>
toxic concentration level to effective concentration level) than paclitaxel in some human<br>
tumor cell lines. The invention possibly enables delivery of enhanced amounts of<br>
metabolite B and other active metabolites of paclitaxel to tumor sites because upon oral<br>
administration all of the administered paclitaxel will pass through the liver and undergo<br>
metabolism by liver microsomes, yielding more of each metabolite in the systemic<br>
circulation than is achieved with IV administration.<br>
An additional aspect of the invention relates to kits to be used in the<br>
treatment of mammalian patients suffering from conditions responsive to any<br>
pharmacologically active target agents whose oral absorption and bioavailability is<br>
increased by an enhancing agent. These kits include one or more oral dosage forms of<br>
at least one enhancing agent and one or more oral dosage forms of at least one target<br>
agent, or one or more dosage forms which comprise both.<br>
By way of illustration, a kit of the invention may include one or more<br>
tablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps or liquid formulations containing cyclosporine or<br>
ketoconazole, and one or more tablets, capsules, caplets, gelcaps or liquid formulations<br>
containing paclitaxel or etoposide in dosage amounts within the ranges described<br>
above. Such kits may be used in hospitals, clinics, physician"s offices or in patients"<br>
homes to facilitate the co-administration of the enhancing and target agents. The kits<br>
should also include as an insert printed dosing information for the co-administration of<br>
the enhancing and target agents.<br>
The subject kits may also include combinations of different enhancing<br>
agents and/or combinations of target agents. For example, a kit may include oral<br>
dosage forms respectively containing a cyclosporin and ketoconazole as enhancing<br>
agents, with paclitaxel alone as the target agent or with a combination of paclitaxel and<br>
another antitumor drug. The second target agent should be (like paclitaxel) a drug that<br>
exhibits poor oral bioavailability but with co-administration of enhancing agents can<br>
achieve therapeutically effective blood levels upon oral administration. The target<br>
agent may co-exist with the enhancing agent in the same dosage form or may be in a<br>
separate dosage form.<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects of the invention<br>
and demonstrate the unexpected, very substantial increases in the oral absorption of<br>
target agents achieved. These examples are not intended, however, to limit the<br>
invention in any way or to set icing or target agents, dosage ranges,<br>
testing procedures or other parameter which must be used exclusively to practice the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Eighteen (18) healthy Sprague Dawley rats, all weighing from 225-275<br>
grams and approximately six to eight weeks old, were randomly divided into three<br>
groups of six animals. The first group of six rats received a single IV administration of<br>
paclitaxel at a dose of 9 mg/kg. The second group received a single oral dose of<br>
paclitaxel at 9 mg/kg. The third group received a single oral dose of cyclosporine at 5<br>
mg/kg, and one hour later the same group received an oral dose of 5 mg/kg<br>
cyclosporine and 9 mg/kg paclitaxel.<br>
Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of each rat at 0.5, 1, 2, 3,<br>
4 and 6 hours after the paclitaxel dose. In the case of the IV-treated rats of the first<br>
group, an additional blood sample was taken at eight hours after the paclitaxel dose.<br>
The individual samples were centrifuged and the serum was separated. For each time<br>
interval, the six samples per group were composited to produce a single representative<br>
sample. All samples were assayed for unchanged paclitaxel by LC/MS with a lower<br>
limit of quantitation 6f 50 pg/ml.<br>
The results of the study are graphically illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG 1<br>
compares all three groups of rats while FIG. 2 compares only the second and third<br>
groups which received oral paclitaxel. It may be seen that in the absence of<br>
cyclosporine, the bioavailability of the paclitaxel in serum was less than 1% but it rose<br>
to 6-7% in the third group which received cyclosporine one hour prior to a<br>
cyclosporine/paclitaxel combined dose.<br>
The following Table 2 sets forth data regarding the area under the curve<br>
(AUC) values determined for the three groups of rats. These data indicate that the<br>
AUC value over six hours in the case of the third group of rats receiving both<br>
cyclosporine and paclitaxel was almost eight times the AUC for the second group of<br>
rats receiving onlv oral paclitaxel.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Forty (40) healthy Sprague Dawley rats with the same characteristics as<br>
those used in the study described in Example 1 were randomly divided into four groups<br>
often each labeled Groups A, F, G and H. The following Table 3 indicates the<br>
treatment provided to each of the test groups and the time intervals for each dosage<br>
administration.<br>
Blood samples were collected from the tail vein of each rat at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,<br>
3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after paclitaxel administration. After appropriate treatment<br>
of the samples and the creation of one composite sample for each group, the plasma from<br>
each sample was assayed for unchanged paclitaxel.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 graphically illustrate the results of this study. In FIG. 3 a<br>
comparison is shown between the concentration levels achieved over time in Group A,<br>
which received a cyclosporine pre-dose and a combined paclitaxel-cyclosporine dose one<br>
hour later, and Group F, which received a cyclosporine pre-dose and then only oral<br>
paclitaxel one hour later. FIG. 4 reflects a comparison between the results achieved with<br>
Groups G and H, both of which received paclitaxel IV but with Group G receiving a pre-<br>
dose of oral cyclosporine three hours before the paclitaxel. As indicated in FIG. 4, the two<br>
groups exhibited essentially the identical levels of paclitaxel in plasma at the same time<br>
intervals.<br>
Table 4 sets forth the AUC data for the four groups of rats in this study.<br>
While the AUC values for Groups G and H were essentially the same, the AUC value for<br>
Group A was 25-30% higher than that for Group F, indicating the value of providing both<br>
cyclosporine pre-treatment and co-administration of cyclosporine with paclitaxel.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
Eighteen (18) healthy Sprague Dawley rats with the same characteristics<br>
as those used in the study described in Example 1 were randomly divided into three<br>
groups of six rats, Groups A; B and C. Group A was administered radiolabeled<br>
paclitaxel IV; Group B received 3 H-radiolabeled paclitaxel orally; and Group C received<br>
an oral dose of cyclosporine followed one hour later by a combined oral dose of<br>
cyclosporine and radiola"beled oral paclitaxel.<br>
Blood samples were collected from the tail veins of each rat at the same<br>
time intervals as described in Example 2. The samples were kept in the form of whole<br>
blood. In addition, urine samples were taken from each rat 4-24 hours post-paclitaxel<br>
dose. The blood and urine samples were analyzed for radioactivity.<br>
A comparison of the paclitaxel levels in the whole blood samples from<br>
Groups A, B and C is set forth in FIG 5. Comparisons of the levels for the individual<br>
members of Groups B and C are set forth in FIGS. 6 and 7, respectively.<br>
In this study, the oral absorption of radioactivity (expressed as paclitaxel<br>
equivalents) in whole blood was about 10% in the absence of cyclosporine (Group B)<br>
and about 40% with concomitant cyclosporine administration (Group C). This was<br>
determined by measuring the AUC of blood radioactivity after intravenous and oral<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel. The bioavailability of paclitaxel was not determined formally in<br>
this study because that would require assaying for unchanged drug at each time point.<br>
At one time point, though, the radioactivity was extracted from plasma and after<br>
standard HPLC it appeared that at least 32% of the radioactivity in the plasma was<br>
unchanged paclitaxel. The radioactivity profile from the HPLC-plasma extract of Group<br>
C animals, demonstrating predominantly one peak (which is paclitaxel), is shown in<br>
FIG. 28. Set forth below in.Table 5 are AUC, Cmax, Tmax, and other data generated by<br>
this study.<br>
In rats that were treated in the manner described in Example 3, AUC for<br>
total radioactivity was determined. Based on the ratio of AUCoral/AUCiv to infinity, oral<br>
absorption in the presence of cyclosporine rose to 54.7% compared to 16.4% in the<br>
absence of cyclosporine (Table 5a). Using a similar analysis for unchanged paclitaxel in<br>
blood, bioavailability of paclitaxel was 25.7% in the presence of cyclosporine and 1.7%<br>
in the absence of cyclosporine (Table 5b). Body clearance was surprisingly similar<br>
among the three treatment groups. Volume of distribution of paclitaxel was enhanced<br>
about 50% more in the group that received cyclosporine and oral paclitaxel compared<br>
to the IV paclitaxel group.<br>
In Examples 4-5 the following study design was utilized: Sprague-Dawley<br>
rats with the same characteristics as those used in the study described in Example 1<br>
were divided into three groups of three male rats each. All of the rats were fasted 12-<br>
14 hours prior to dosing. At the end of the fasting period, those rats receiving<br>
enhancing agents were administered those agents, and one hour later received a dose<br>
of radiolabeled (3 H) paclitaxel (9 mg/kg) with concomitant doses of enhancing agent.<br>
The rats not receiving enhancing agents were administered the radiolabeled paclitaxel<br>
after fasting.<br>
Blood was collected from each animal at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and<br>
24 hours following the paclitaxel dosing. Urine was collected from 4-24 hours post<br>
dose. Total radioactivity in blood and urine was then determined for each rat and mean<br>
values were calculated for each group.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Three groups of rats were administered, respectively, 10 mg/kg of<br>
verapamil orally, 5 mg/kg of progesterone orally and 10 mg/kg of dipyridamole orally as<br>
enhancing agents, both alone and one hour later with an oral dose of paclitaxel. A<br>
graphical comparison of the whole blood concentration-time profile (measured as<br>
concentration equivalents versus time) determined for the three groups is set forth in<br>
FIG. 8. The data reflect roughly similar results with the use of verapamil and<br>
dipyridamole as enhancing agents, with markedly lower bioavailability achieved with<br>
progesterone.<br>
FIG. 9 sets forth a graphical comparison between the concentration-time<br>
profile of paclitaxel determined for the group of rats administered verapamil (10 mg/kg)<br>
as an enhancing agent with the values determined in a prior study for animals<br>
administered oral paclitaxel (9 mg/kg) alone and another group administered oral<br>
cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) both one hour before and again immediately after a dose of oral<br>
paclitaxel (9 mg/kg). The group receiving cyclosporine achieved far higher blood levels<br>
than the other groups throughout almost the entire 24-hour period.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 represent parallel graphical comparisons to FIG. 9, but<br>
with the values for the progesterone-administered group shown in FIG. 10 and the<br>
dipyridamole group shown in FIG. 11 in place of the verapamil group of FIG. 9.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Three groups of rats were administered, respectively, 100 mg/kg of<br>
verapamil orally, 5 mg/kg of megestrol acetate orally and 50 mg/kg of ketoconazole<br>
orally as enhancing agents, both alone and one hour later with an oral dose of<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel. A graphical comparison of the whole blood concentration-time<br>
profile (measured as concentration equivalents versus time) determined for the three<br>
groups is set forth in FIG. 12. The data reflect roughly similar results for verapamil and<br>
megestrol acetate as enhancing agents, with markedly higher bioavailability achieved<br>
with ketoconazole in the first 12 hours.<br>
FIG. 13 sets forth a graphical comparison betwen the concentration-time<br>
profile of radioactivity determined for the group of rats administered verapamil (100<br>
mg/kg) as an enhancing agent with the values determined in a prior study for animals<br>
administered oral paclitaxel (9 mg/kg) alone and another group administered oral<br>
cyclosporine (5 mg/kg) both one hour before and again immediately after a dose of oral<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel (9 mg/kg).<br>
FIGS. 14 and 15 represent parallel graphical comparisons to FIG. 13, but<br>
with the values for the megestrol acetate-administered group shown in FIG. 14 and the<br>
ketoconazole group shown in FIG. 15 in place of the verapamil group of FIG. 13.<br>
FIG. 16 sets forth graphical comparisons between the concentration-time<br>
profiles of radioactivity determined for the group of rats administered 10 mg/kg of<br>
verapamil in Example 4 and the group administered 100 mg/kg of verapamil in Example<br>
5.<br>
FIG. 17 sets forth graphical comparisons between the concentration-time<br>
profiles of radioactivity determined for the group of rats administered 5 mg/kg of<br>
progesterone in Example 4 and the group administered 5 mg/kg of megestrol acetate in<br>
Example 5.<br>
In both FIGS. 16 and 17 there are also shown the same profiles reflected<br>
in FIGS. 13-15 for study groups receiving oral radiolabeled paclitaxel alone and oral<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel immediately after and one hour after 5 mg/kg of cyclosporine.<br>
Exploration of dose-response data for cyclosporine was performed.<br>
Increasing the dose to 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg one hour before and concomitantly with<br>
paclitaxel resulted in oral absorption of radioactivity to about 45%. This can be<br>
contrasted with the findings for ketoconazole in which doses of up to 50 mg/kg were<br>
given one hour before and concomitantly with paclitaxel and resulted in no further<br>
increase in oral absorption of radioactivity (see FIGS. 17A and 17B).<br>
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the study groups of animals<br>
discussed in Examples 4 and 5 are set forth in Table 6.3<br>
The data generated by the studies of Examples 4 and 5 and reflected in<br>
Table 6 and FIGS. 8-17B clearly indicate the efficacy of cyclosporine as an oral<br>
bioavailability enhancing agent and its superiority to high or low dose verapamil,<br>
progesterone or megestrol acetate, particularly in the first 12 hours after paclitaxel<br>
dosing. They also indicate that ketoconazole, while not as effective as cyclosporine,<br>
also has significant activity in promoting the oral absorption of paclitaxel.<br>
3The study of Example 4 is identified in Table 6 as protocol NP951202,<br>
and the study of Example 5 is identified as protocol NP960101.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Three groups of three male rats each were fasted 16-18 hours prior to<br>
dosing. At the end of the fasting period one group of rats was administered an oral<br>
dose of 5 mg/kg of cyclosporine. One hour later, that group was administered 5 mg/kg<br>
of cyclosporine orally with 1 mg/kg of3 H-radiolabeled etoposide orally. The other two<br>
groups were administered after fasting only 1 mg/kg of3 H-etoposide IV and 1 mg/kg<br>
H-etoposide orally, respectively. The procedures for blood and urine collection and for<br>
determining total radioactivity were the same as in Examples 4 and 5 except that blood<br>
was taken at two additional intervals from the group receiving etoposide IV, at 0.033<br>
and 0.25 hours. The resultant data are set forth in Table 7.<br>
FIGS. 18 and 19 set forth graphically the mean whole blood<br>
concentration-time profile of etoposide determined for the three study groups. In FIG.<br>
18 the ordinate scale runs from 0-1 etoposide concentration equivalents (ppm), while in<br>
FIG. 19 the ordinate scale runs from 0-0.2 etoposide equivalents (ppm) to more clearly<br>
illustrate the differences between the values achieved for the three groups.<br>
The data set forth in Table 7 and FIGS. 18 and 19 demonstrate the<br>
efficacy of cyclosporine as an oral bioavailability enhancing agent for etoposide,<br>
particularly in the first 12 hours after dosing.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
In another series of studies, three groups of three male rats each were<br>
fasted 16-18 hours prior to dosing. At the end of the fasting period one group of rats<br>
was administered an oral dose of ketoconazole (2 mg/kg). One hour later, that group<br>
was administered 2 mg/kg of ketoconazole orally with 1 mg/kg of3 H-radiolabeled<br>
etoposide_orally. The other two groups were treated in the same fashion except that<br>
they were administered 10 and 50 mg/kg of ketoconazole, respectively, after fasting<br>
prior to and just after 3 H-etoposide orally. The procedures for blood collection and for<br>
determining total radioactivity were the same as in Examples 4 and 5. The resultant<br>
data are set forth in Table 7A. Thus, in contrast to the effect that cyclosporine had on<br>
nearly doubling the oral absorption of paclitaxel-derived radioactivity, ketoconazoje<br>
administered over a wide range of doses did not enhance the oral absorption of<br>
etoposide compared to etoposide alone/<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
An excretion balance study for paclitaxel in rats was conducted. Three<br>
groups of 4-5 male rats each were fasted 12-14 hours prior to dosing. At the end of the<br>
fasting period one group of rats was administered an oral dose of 5 mg/kg of<br>
cyclosporine. One hour later, that group was administered 5 mg/kg of cyclosporine<br>
orally with 9 mg/kg of radiolabeled paclitaxel orally. The other two groups were<br>
administered after fasting only 9 mg/kg of radiolabeled paclitaxel IV and 9 mg/kg of<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel orally.<br>
The urine and feces were collected from each animal at the following<br>
intervals: 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, 24-36, 36-48, 48-72, 72-96, 96-120, 120-144, and<br>
144-168 hours post-dose. Tissue collection was performed at 168 hours post-dose.<br>
The procedure for determining total radioactivity was the same as in Examples 4 and 5.<br>
FIG. 20 sets forth a graphical comparison of the mean cumulative<br>
percentage of dose of paclitaxel detected in the feces and urine of the test animals over<br>
the 168-hour period. The group of rats administered cyclosporine both before and with<br>
the oral paclitaxel exhibited a markedly lower percentage of dose in feces than the<br>
other two groups and a significantly higher percentage of dose in urine, indicating that<br>
substantially more of the oral paclitaxel diffused through the gut wall and entered the<br>
systemic circulation of the animals in the cyclosporine treated group. In addition, the<br>
fact that the percentage of dose in urine was significantly higher for the rats<br>
administered oral cyclosporine and paclitaxel in comparison with the IV-paclitaxel group<br>
indicates that the concomitant oral administration caused a higher concentration of<br>
radioactivity to pass through the genito-urinary tract.<br>
FIGS. 21-24 are bar graphs reflecting the mean ppm values of paclitaxel<br>
detected in a variety of tissues harvested from the rats in the three study groups, Group<br>
A representing the animals administered paclitaxel IV, Group B representing those<br>
administered paclitaxel orally and Group C representing the cyclosporine-treated group.<br>
These graphs show that the levels of paclitaxel found in the various tissues from the<br>
rats in Group C were roughly comparable to the levels observed in the rats from Group<br>
A that received paclitaxel IV, except in the liver where the level of paclitaxel was more<br>
than twice as high in the cyclosporine treated group as in the group administered<br>
paclitaxel IV. The levels detected in the tissues of the rats of Group B (administered<br>
oral paclitaxel alone) were quite low, in most instances far less than half of the levels in<br>
either of the other groups.<br>
The data resulting from this study are set forth in Tables 8 and 9.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Another tissue distribution study for paclitaxel in rats was conducted. Two<br>
groups of 10 male rats each were fasted 12-14 hours prior to dosing. At the end of the<br>
fasting period one group of rats was administered an oral dose of 5 mg/kg cyclosporine.<br>
One hour later, that group was administered 5 mg/kg of cyclosporine orally with 9 mg/kg<br>
of radiolabeled paclitaxel orally. The other group was administered after fasting only 9<br>
mg/kg of radiolabeled paclitaxel IV.<br>
Tissue collection was performed at 24 hours post-dose. The procedure<br>
for determining total radioactivity was the same as in Examples 4 and 5.<br>
Table 9A reflects the ppm values of paclitaxel-derived radioactivity<br>
detected in a variety of tissues harvested from the rats in the two study groups. One<br>
group representing the animals administered paclitaxel IV and the second group<br>
representing those administered paclitaxel with cyclosporine given 1 hour prior to and<br>
immediately after paclitaxel. The levels of paclitaxel found in the various tissues from<br>
the cyclosporine-treated rats were roughly comparable to the levels observed in the rats<br>
given paclitaxel IV, except in the spleen, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract where the<br>
level of paclitaxel was about twice as high in the cyclosporine-treated group as in the<br>
group administered paclitaxel IV.<br>
A comparison of unchanged paclitaxel concentrations in various organs<br>
after IV paclitaxel alone compared to oral paclitaxel given in the presence of<br>
cyclosporine is shown in Table 9B. Higher concentrations of unchanged paclitaxel after<br>
oral administration were found in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, compared to the<br>
IV route of administrati+on.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
The procedure of Examples 4 and 5 was followed, but the three groups of<br>
three male rats each were orally administered respectively 5 mg/kg doses of<br>
cyclosporin D, cyclosporin G and cyclosporin A, both alone and one hour later<br>
immediately after an oral dose of 9 mg/kg radiolabeled paclitaxel. FIG. 25 sets forth a<br>
graphical comparison of the whole blood concentration-time profiles for radioactivity<br>
determined in these three test groups. While all three cyclosporins showed substantial<br>
activity in promoting oral absorption of paclitaxel, the cyclosporin D, which has the least<br>
immunosuppressive activity (Jeffery, Clin. Biochem, 24:15-21 (1991)), of the three<br>
cyclosporins tested, exhibited the greatest bioavailability enhancing activity.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
A number of studies were conducted wherein the procedure used in<br>
Examples 4 and 5 was followed, and groups of three male rats each were orally<br>
administered 5-10 mg/kg of various cyclosporins alone and then again one hour later<br>
immediately after an oral dose of 9 mg/kg radiolabeled paclitaxel. Table 10 sets forth a<br>
comparison of AUC and % absorption from these studies, each identified by a protocol<br>
number beginning with the prefix "NP".<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
The procedure of Examples 4 and 5 was followed, but the three groups of<br>
three male rats each were orally administered respectively a 5 mg/kg dose of<br>
cyclosporin A, 50 mg/kg ketoconazole and 5 mg/kg cyclosporin A plus 50 mg/kg<br>
ketoconazole, both alone and one hour later immediately after an oral dose of 9 mg/kg<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel. A graphical comparison of the results achieved is set forth in<br>
FIG. 26. The group receiving the combination of ketoconazole and cyclosporin A<br>
unexpectedly exhibited significantly higher blood radioactivity levels over almost the<br>
entire 24-hour period than the groups receiving only one of these enhancing agents.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
The procedure of Examples 4 and 5 was followed, but the three groups of<br>
three male rats each were orally administered respectively a 100 mg/kg dose of<br>
captopril both alone and two hours later immediately after an oral dose of 9 mg/kg<br>
radiolabeled paclitaxel, a 5 mg/kg dose of cyclosporine alone and again one hour later<br>
immediately after a 9 mg/kg oral dose of radiolabeled paclitaxel, and a 9 mg/kg oral<br>
dose of radiolabeled paclitaxel alone. A graphical comparison of the results achieved is<br>
set forth in FIG. 27.<br>
The aforedescribed studies produced several previously unknown and<br>
unexpected findings which are all of great significance to the clinical management of<br>
many diseases, particularly various types of cancer:<br>
1. Certain MDR (P-glycoprotein) inhibitors as well as other agents not<br>
known to be MDR inhibitors can be administered orally to effectively enhance the oral<br>
bioavailability of treatment agents which have until now been administered only<br>
parenterally because therapeutic blood levels cannot be attained upon oral<br>
administration.<br>
2. Co-administration of the enhancing agents of the invention with target<br>
drugs having poor oral bioavailability can achieve sustained blood levels of the target<br>
drugs comparable to that achieved with IV infusion therapy but with a less abrupt initial<br>
rise in blood levels and hence less likelihood of toxic side effects.<br>
3. The oral co-administration of the enhancing agents and target drugs<br>
increases the proportionate concentration of the target agent in the liver, lung and<br>
gastrointestinal tract in comparison with IV administration, making the novel method of<br>
administration particularly useful in the treatment of liver tumors and metastases.<br>
4. Administering an enhancing agent orally prior to administration of<br>
concomitant oral doses of enhancing agent and target drug increases the oral<br>
bioavailability of the target drug to a significantly higher degree than co-administration<br>
of the enhancing and target agents with no preadministration of enhancing agent. This<br>
results in plasma levels of the target drug reaching therapeutic levels.<br>
5. Cyclosporins, particularly cyclosporins A, D and F, are much more<br>
effective agents for enhancing the bioavailability of antitumor agents than MDR<br>
inhibitors such as verapamil and progesterone. Ketoconazole has clinically significant<br>
oral bioavailability-enhancing activity, but less than the cyclosporins.<br>
In general, the various aspects of the invention enable and make practical<br>
for the first time the administration of oral dosage forms of widely used pharmaceutical<br>
agents, particularly anti-cancer drugs such as paclitaxel related taxanes and etoposide,<br>
which until now could only be administered effectively or reliably by IV infusion. The<br>
use of such oral dosage forms in the clinical management of cancers will promote<br>
patient comfort, convenience, compliance and safety and result in cost savings to<br>
patients, hospitals and government and private medical insurers.<br>
In addition, the teachings of the invention set forth herein provide<br>
information regarding the selection of target and enhancing agents as well as timing,<br>
schedules and dosing. This information and the methods and compositions of the<br>
invention provide clinicians with procedures for sustaining therapeutic levels of drugs<br>
which require narrow windows of drug concentrations while avoiding unnecessary and<br>
frequently harmful peaks and valleys in blood concentration levels. In addition,<br>
increased volume of distribution of paclitaxel in the presence of cyclosporine, suggests<br>
more drug would be available for anti-tumor activity.<br>
Apart from multi-drug resistance resulting from P-glycoprotein encoded by<br>
the MDR1 gene, there is another gene which has recently been found to confer a multi-<br>
drug resistance phenotype in certain laboratory systems: the gene for multi-drug-<br>
resistance-associated protein, MRP (e.g., Zaman et al., Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci. USA. 91:<br>
8822-8826, 1994).<br>
Less is known about this new gene and its protein product, a 190-kd<br>
membrane bound glycoprotein. Although both the MRP and MDR1 genes encode<br>
membrane glycoproteins that can act as transporters of multiple drugs, there are<br>
differences in function, likely substrates, and prognostic significance between these two<br>
genes. For example MRP but not MDR1 gene expression is a good marker of poor<br>
clinical outcome in patients with neuroblastomas. The putative function of the MRP-<br>
related proteins is to serve as an efflux pump for glutathione S-conjugates. Thus,<br>
molecules that undergo glutathione conjugation would be susceptible to the action of<br>
the MRP-related system.<br>
The oral bioavailability of pharmacologically active agents (or exposure of<br>
the tumor to such agents) which are subject to resistance by MRP-related proteins can<br>
be enhanced by orally co-administrating MRP inhibitors. The preferred embodiment of<br>
this method of increasing oral bioavailability is the oral administration of one or more<br>
MRP inhibitors prior to the oral co-administration of one or more MRP inhibitors and one<br>
or more target agents subject to MRP-related resistance.<br>
Examples of target agents of this type include (but are not limited to) vinca<br>
alkaloids (e.g., vincristine), anthracyclines, epidophyllotoxins (e.g., etoposide) and<br>
various taxanes. Examples of MRP inhibitors that can increase oral bioavailability of<br>
target agents include, but are not limited to, cyclosporins, ketoconazole and the<br>
experimental drugs VX-710 and VX-853 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge,<br>
MA). The structures of VX-710 and VX 853, as well as many related compounds, are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,773.<br>
Another method of improving the oral bioavailability of agents subject to<br>
MRP-related resistance is to co-administer with those agents glutathione or substances<br>
which form glutathione-conjugated products which would interfere with the functioning<br>
of the MRP system and enhance the absorption of the target agents from the gut, or<br>
increase the systemic exposure of agents subjected to MRP-related transport.<br>
Yet another system capable of conferring multi-drug resistance is the so-<br>
called Lung Resistance-Related Protein (LRP), because it was first identified in a multi-<br>
drug resistant lung cancer cell line. This protein is the major structural protein of the so-<br>
called vault apparatus, a large abundant cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle, which<br>
has been conserved from slime mold to man. Inhibition of this system may also<br>
positively affect oral bioavailability of certain agents. LRP is found in highest<br>
expression in epithelial cells with secretory and excretory functions, as well as in cells<br>
chronically exposed to xenobiotics, such as bronchial and intestinal lining cells<br>
(Scheffer et a!., Nature Medicine. 1; 578-582, 1955). Therefore, this system could also<br>
serve as a target for enhancing oral bioavailability.<br>
It has thus been shown that there are provided methods, compositions<br>
and kits which achieve the various objects of the invention and which are well adapted<br>
to meet the conditions of practical use.<br>
