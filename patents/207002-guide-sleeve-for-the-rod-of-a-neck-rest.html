"GUIDE SLEEVE FOR THE ROD OF A NECK REST"<br>
ITW-ATECO GmbH, of Im Wasen 1, D-97285 Rottingen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
291/MUM/2000<br><br><br>
30 MAR 2000<br>
GRANTED<br>

GUIDE SLEEVE FOR THE ROD OF A NECK REST<br>
This invention relates to a guide sleeve for the rod of a neck rest according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Such guide sleeves are usually made of plastic material. They are inserted into the back rest of a seat and serve for accommodating the rod of a neck rest which is intended to be locked in the guide sleeve in certain rest positions. It is known to arrange an actuating slide in an enlargement at the upper end of the guide sleeve, which cooperates with a spring or a similar detent member which cooperates with the notches of the neck rest rod so as to lock it in a pre-set position. Such guide sleeves operate satisfactorily, but have the drawback that the expenditure in mounting is relatively high.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to create a guide sleeve for the rod of a neck rest in automobile vehicles, which causes a lower expenditure in mounting.<br>
This object is attained by the features of claim.1.<br>
In conventional guide sleeves, a metallic spring is mostly used as a locking member, which requires to be brought to its shape in an appropriate stamping and bending procedure and which subsequently is mounted along with the actuating element. In the invention, however, a locking portion is disposed at the lower end of a deflection lever. The deflection lever extends parallel to the axis of the guide sleeve outside and is rotatably supported about an axis between the ends, which extends transverse<br><br><br>
to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve. The deflection lever is biased by spring means so that the spring biases the locking portion against the rod. The deflection lever is coupled to the actuating element at the upper end so that when the actuating element is actuated the lever may be pivoted in such a way that the locking portion gets out of engagement with a recess of the back rest rod.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a guide sleeve for the rod of a neck rest in automobile vehicles which sleeve is mounted in the back rest of a seat from above, the sleeve comprising a throughbore through which the rod is extended, an enlargement at the upper end which slidably supports an actuating element, releasable locking means which have a locking portion which cooperates with a locking recess provided in the rod in order to secure the rod against axial displacement, the locking portion is disengaged with the locking recess if the actuating element is actuated, characterized in that a deflection lever is provided which is located at the outer side of the guide sleeve and extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve, the lever being limitedly rotatably supported about an axis lying between the ends of the lever and extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve, the locking portion being provided at the lower end of the lever, the lever being biased by spring means which bias the locking portion against the rod and the actuating element cooperating with the upper end of the lever.<br>
Various possible designs are imaginable for the construction of the deflection lever. According to the invention, one is that the deflection lever is matched to the outer contour of the guide sleeve and partically encircles the guide sleeve. The deflection lever may have a bearing projection at both longitudinal sides which is rounded at the end thereof and engages a correspondingly formed bearing recess of the guide sleeve.<br>
In order to prevent the actuating element from unintentionally being moved out of the enlargement of the guide sleeve or the upper end of the deflection lever from unintentionally being pivoted away from the guide sleeve a window is provided, in<br><br><br>
an aspect of the invention, in the deflection lever above the support axis wherein a protrusion of the guide sleeve extends through the window. The protrusion serves for as an attachment or fixation means in the back rest structure. In an aspect of the invention, the deflection lever has a second window below the support axis wherein at least one protrusion extends through the window. Even this one forms a fixation means in the back rest.<br>
The invention will now be explained by way of an example shown in the drawings.<br>
Fig. 1   shows an exploded perspective view of the guide sleeve according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of how the arrangement of Fig. 1 is assembled.<br>
Fig. 3  shows a schematic section which illustrates the way of action of the sleeve guide of Fig. 2.<br>
The guide sleeve shown in Figures 1 and 2 for use on a rod of a neck rest in an automobile vehicle has a sleeve body 12, a deflection lever 14, a slide-like actuating element 16, and an O-ring 18. The individual components will now be explained in detail.<br>
The sleeve body 10 which is integrally formed from plastic material has an elongate hollow shank 20 which, in a very general sense, is of an approximately square cross-section which has strongly rounded corners. At its upper end, the body has a ring-shaped enlargement 22 which is hollow and has a lateral opening 24. The lateral opening 24 is in communication with the interior of enlargement 22 which extends transversely to a through bore 26 which extends across the whole sleeve body 12.<br><br><br><br>
An elongate opening 30 is defined in the bottom 28 of the interior of enlargement<br>
22.<br>
A circumferential region extending across the length of shank 20 has a contour reduced in its radius, which causes shoulders to be formed on opposed sides out of which one can be seen at 32. Formed into shoulder 32 is recess 34 which is rounded at its end and has a narrow cross-section. A second, equally-shaped recess is provided on the other side of shank 20 which cannot be seen.<br>
The contour of shank 20 between shoulders 32 is complementary to the inside contour of the shell-shaped deflection lever 14. As can be seen from Fig. 2 the deflection lever may be inserted into the reduced-radius circumferential region. To this end, a bearing projection 38 which is rounded at its end engages the bearing recess 34. Because of the complementary shape given to the bearing projection with respect to bearing recess 34 the former is retained simultaneously and cannot be readily pulled out of the bearing recess. Prior to this, an upwardly extending projection 40 of deflection lever 14 is passed through opening 30 from below.<br>
Deflection lever 14 has a first window 42 through which two spaced-apart projections 44, 46 of sleeve body 12 extend when deflection lever 14 is mounted on sleeve body 12 as described. Another window 48 below the window 42 of deflection lever 14 interacts with more projections 50, 52 disposed on shank 20. Projections 44, 46, on one hand, and projections 50, 52, on the other, are used to attach and secure guide sleeve 10 in the back rest.<br>
The reduced-radius circumferential region of shank 20 is shorter than the rest of shank 20. This defines a downwardly projection portion 54 of shank 20 which is provided with a groove 56 at its outside. Portion 54 has formed a recess 56 in it. A<br><br><br>
ring-shaped slot 58 is defined above recess 56. Likewise, deflection lever 14, in its lower region, has a groove 60 extending in a circumferential direction, which is aligned with groove 56 when deflection lever 14 is mounted on sleeve body 12. Groove portions 56, 60 receive the O-ring 18 of Fig. 1. This interconnects the deflection lever 14 and the sleeve body 12 in the lower region and biases them towards each other. Since opening 62, however, has a dimension larger than the cross-section of the neck rest rod lever 14 may be pivoted to a limited extent, the pivoting axis being a horizontal axis which extends through recesses 34 and bearing projections 38.<br>
Before deflection lever 14 is mounted the slide-like actuating element 16 is shifted into the cavity of enlargement 22 through opening 24. The cavity is formed in such a way that element 16 can only be moved in a linear direction. An elongated or oval opening 62 of the element is aligned with bore 26 in the sleeve body 12 and enables the rod of a neck rest to be passed through in different positions of element 16. Element 16 has a downward-facing recess 64 (see Fig. 3) which is engaged by projection 40 after being passed through opening 30 of enlargement 22. Deflection lever 14 will be pivoted in a clockwise direction by pressing the actuating element 16 into the interior of enlargement 22. This causes the lower region of deflection lever 14 to move away from shank 20 and an inside rib 66 on deflection lever 14 (see Fig. 3) to move out of slot 58. Rib 66 is used to interlockingly engage a recess in the rod (not shown) of the neck rest. This fixedly positions the rod in an axial direction. However, when rib 66 is moved out of slot 58 in the way described the neck rest may be axially moved. However, once actuating element 16 is released again the tension of the ring-shaped elastic spring 18 provides for rib 66 to re-cooperate with a notch of the neck rest rod.<br><br><br>
