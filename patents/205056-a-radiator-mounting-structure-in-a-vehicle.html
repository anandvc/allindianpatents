Further, when cooling water in the radiator 72 is expanded since temperature thereof is elevated, extra cooling water overflows to the reservoir and when temperature of cooling water in the radiator 72 is lowered, cooling water is returned from the reservoir to the radiator 72.  By flowing cooling water between the radiator 72 and the reservoir in this way, air stored in the water filling pipe 87 is exhausted to the reservoir. That is, even when the engine E is operated, bleeding of air from the cooling apparatus 83 is carried out excellently.<br>
According to the cooling apparatus 83, in a state of finishing to warm up the engine E, cooling water discharged<br><br>
from the water pump 84 driven by the came shaft 44, is supplied to the first engine block 32 and the water jacket 82 in the cylinder head 34 via the thermostat case 86 and the third conducting pipe 93, cools the engine E while passing through the water jacket 82 and is thereafter supplied to the upper tank 77 of the radiator 72 via the second conducting pipe 92. Further, cooling water temperature of which is lowered while passing through the radiator 72 to flow from the upper tank 77 to the lower tank 78 via the cooling core 79, is returned to the water pump 84 via the first conducting pipe 91 and the thermostat 85. Meanwhile, when the engine E is being warmed up and temperature of cooling water is low, the thermostat 85 is operated to circulate cooling water to detour the radiator 72, cooling water does not pass through the radiator 72 but circulates in the water jacket 82, the carburetor 95 and the water pump 84 to thereby elevate temperature swiftly.<br>
Paying attention to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, the radiator cover 74 fastened to the support case 72 of the radiator 72 to cover the radiator 72, is integrally provided with a position regulating portion 74a engaged with the water filling cap 88 at a closed position for enabling the radiator cover 74 to attach to the radiator 72 and preventing the water filling cap 88 from rotating to an opened position to cover the water filling cap 88. Further, the position regulating portion 74a is provided with a notch 99 for making a portion of the water filling cap 88 face outside.<br><br><br>
Next, when an explanation is given to operation of the embodiment, in the radiator 72 constituting a portion of the cooling apparatus 83 capable of circulating cooling water of the water jacket 82 provided to the engine main body 25, the rear end portion of the upper tank 77 in line with the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F, is integrally provided with the water filling pipe 87 extended upwardly, the water filling cap 88 is attachably and detachably mounted to an upper end of the water filling pipe 87 and the radiator 72 is attached to the engine main body 25 in the attitude inclined to the horizontal face by the angle /3 such that the water filling cap 88 is disposed at the topmost position in the cooling apparatus 83. That is, by forwardly inclining the radiator 72 in a general shape having the upper and the lower tanks 77 and 78 and the cooling core 79 connecting the tanks 77 and 78, to a horizontal face, the cap 88 mounted to the upper end of the water filling pipe 87 provided at the rear end portion of the upper tank 77 is arranged at the topmost position in the cooling apparatus 83.<br>
Therefore, while avoiding an increase in cost by constituting the radiator 72 in a special shape or by providing a water filling cap to a tank connected to the radiator 72 and arranged separately from the radiator 72, when water is filled from the water filling pipe 87, the head difference in the cooling apparatus 83 can comparatively be increased and the performance of bleeding air from the water filling pipe 87 and water filling performance thereof can be promoted.<br><br>
Further, the connection pipe 89 for connecting the first conducting pipe 91 for conducting cooling water from the radiator 72 to the thermostat 85, is provided to the front end portion of the lower tank 78 in line with the front and rear direction of the vehicle body frame F, the inclined attitude of the radiator 72 relative to the horizontal face is set such that the connection pipe 89 is disposed at the bottommost position in the cooling apparatus 83 and without increasing the length of the cooling core 79 in the radiator 72, air can excellently be bled from the lower portion in the cooling apparatus 83 and the water filling performance is further promoted.<br>
Further, the radiator 72 is arranged at the position overlapping at least a portion of the upper tank 77 to the cylinder block 32a in side view, one end of the second conducting pipe 92 arranged in the range of overlapping the upper tank 77 and the cylinder block 32a in side view and extended substantially horizontally, is connected to the cylinder block 32a to communicate with the water jacket 82, other end of the second conducting pipe 92 is connected to the upper tank 77 and therefore, the second conducting pipe 92 connecting the radiator 72 and the cylinder block 32a to flow cooling water between the water jacket 82 and the radiator 72, can be shortened and compact formation of a cooling water circulating circuit in the cooling apparatus 83 can be achieved.<br><br>
Further, the position regulating portion 74a engaged with the water filling cap 88 at the closed position for enabling the radiator cover 74 to attach to the radiator 72 and preventing the water filling cap 88 from rotating to the opened position, is integrally provided to the radiator cover 74 to cover the water filling cap 88 and therefore, in attaching the radiator cover 74 to the radiator 72, when the water filling cap 88 is at the closed position, the radiator cover 74 can be attached to the radiator 72 such that the position regulating portion 74a is engaged with the water filling cap 88.  Therefore, operation of particularly confirming that the water filling cap 88 is at the closed position, is dispensed with, the position of the water filling cap 88 can be confirmed by only operation of attaching the radiator cover 74 to the radiator 72 and assembling performance can be promoted. <br>
Further, by engaging the position regulating portion 74a of the radiator cover 74 with the water filling cap 88, the water filling cap 88 can be prevented from rotating from the closed position to the opened position and therefore, the water filling cap 88 can be maintained at the closed position while avoiding an increase in a number of parts. <br>
Further, the position regulating portion 74a is provided with the notch 99 for making a portion of the water filling cap 88 face outside and presence of the water filling cap 88 can be confirmed easily from outside of the radiator cover 74.<br><br><br>
Although as described above, an explanation has been given of the embodiment of the invention, the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment but design can be changed variously without deviating from the invention described in the scope of claims.<br>
For example, although according to the above-described embodiment, an explanation has been given of the case of applying the embodiment to a motorcycle V, the invention is applicable to other vehicle such as a three-wheeled vehicle. 104437}<br>
