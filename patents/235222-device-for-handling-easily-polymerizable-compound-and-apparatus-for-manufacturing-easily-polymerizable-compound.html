				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
DEVICE FOR HANDLING EASILY POLYMERIZABLE COMPOUND AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING EASILY POLYMERIZABLE COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to: a device for handling an  easily polymerizable compound, applied to column equipment such as a distillation column and an evaporation column for an easily polymerizable compound; and an apparatus for manufacturing an easily polymerizable compound.  The present invention more specif ically relates to: a device for handling an easily polymerizable compound, applied to column equipment provided with a column top gas condenser or a vent gas condenser; and an apparatus for manufacturing an easily polymerizable compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
Equipment for manufacturing an easily polymerizable compound such as (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrylate employs column equipment such as a distillation column for crude (meth)acrylic acid or crude (meth)acrylate or a decomposition reaction distillation column for recovering (meth) acrylic acid or the like by decomposing a high boiling point substance.<br>
In such column equipment, part or whole of a column top gas may be cooled and liquefied in a column top gas<br><br>
condenser for liquefaction, to thereby form a reflux or a distillate- Further, a gas (vent gas) containing valuable substances, which were not condensed in the column top gas condenser, may be cooled in a vent gas condenser, to thereby recover the valuable substances.<br>
When a gaseous easily polymerizable substance is condensed and liquefied in a condenser, an inhibitor-less solution without a polymerization inhibitor is formed. Thus, such a condenser for handling an easily polymerizable substance conventionally employs a technique of spraying a solution containing a polymerization inhibitor into the condenser for suppressing formation of a polymerized product in a condensate, to thereby include the polymerization inhibitor in the condensate (see JP 2000-344688 A, for example).<br>
When such a conventional spray for spraying a solution containing a polymerization inhibitor is provided, a tube for introducing a solution containing the polymerization inhibitor into the spray is provided with a supporter for suppressing vibration of the tube and the spray in use because of a volume of liquid flow, a weight of the tube, or the like.<br>
In a conventional vertical fixed tube plate-type condenser. 50 to which a gas containing an easily polymerizable compound is supplied from above as shown in Fig. 5 for example, a polymerization inhibitor supply tube 53 which supplies a polymerization inhibitor to a spray 52<br><br>
such that the polymerization inhibitor is sprayed on an entire top face of a tube plate 51, which is dividing a gas passage and a cooling medium passage, above the tube plate 51 from the spray 52; is supported inside the condenser 50 from below by a supporter 54. Further as shown in Fig. 6 for example, the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 53 is supported by a supporter 55 from above inside the condenser 50. A gas supplied to the condenser 50 is condensed in a cooling tube 56.<br>
A condensate easily forms a polymerized product because the condensate contains no polymerization inhibitor.  Thus, a polymerization inhibitor-containing liquid is sprayed on the tube plate 51 from the spray 52 through the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 53 for suppressing polymerization.  Thus, formation of a polymerized product on the tube plate 51 is prevented. Further, the polymerization inhibitor-containing liquid flows into the cooling tube 5 6, to thereby supply the polymerization inhibitor to the condensate formed inside the cooling tube 56.<br>
The above-mentioned conventional condenser is generally provided inside a condenser to avoid interference with a transportation operation or disassembly and cleaning operation of the condenser.  However, an easily polymerizable compound may be condensed on a supporter, thereby a polymerized product may be formed.<br>
To be more specific, a temperature of a liquid flowing<br><br>
through the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 53 being in contact with the supporter 54 or 55 is usually lower than a temperature of a gas containing an easily polymerizable compound supplied to the condenser 50. Thus, the supporter 54 or 55 is cooled and a condensate without a polymerization inhibitor is formed on the supporter 54 or 55, possibly a polymerized product may be formed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a device allowing a stable continuous operation with a condenser for a long period of time by preventing polymerization of an  easily polymerizable compound in the condenser into which a vapor of an easily polymerizable compound vapor is supplied with a simple structure thereof.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have studied intensively and have found out that formation of a polymerized product can  be avoided as follows.   (1) The supporter is provided outside a condenser where a condensate is not formed.  (2) In case strength is insufficient when the supporter was provided outside the condenser, it is necessary to provide the supporter inside the condenser. In case of providing the supporter inside the condenser, a solution containing a polymerization inhibitor is sprayed on the supporter, too.<br>
That is, the present invention is: a handling device for handling an easily polymerizable compound into which<br><br>
a vapor of an easily polymerizable compound is supplied, comprising: a condensation part in which the easily polymerizable compound may be condensed inside the handling device; a spreader for the condensation part for spreading a polymerization inhibitor on the condensation part; a polymerization inhibitor supply tube for supplying the polymerization inhibitor to the spreader for the condensation part; and a support means for supporting the spreader for the condensation part at a predetermined position inside the handling device, wherein the support means is a means for supporting the polymerization inhibitor supply tube outside the handling device; and an apparatus for manufacturing an easily polymerizable compound having the handling device.<br>

A distilled substance from the top of the column is introduced into the reflux tank 21 through the tube 19 and the condenser 20.  A column bottom<br><br>
temperature is preferably 60 to 120°C, particularly preferably 70 to 100°C, and a column top pressure is preferably 1 to 50 kPa, particularly preferably 2 to 20 kPa.<br>
Part of acrylic acid in the reflux tank 21 is returned to the top of the column through the pump 22 and the tube 23. Other part of the acrylic acid is delivered through the tube 27 and mixed with the polymerization inhibitor supplied from the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 30. The mixture is supplied to the spray 35 provided inside each of the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25 through the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 and the second polymerization inhibitor supply tube 29.<br>
A mixed solution of acrylic acid and the polymerization inhibitor is sprayed on the entire top face of the tube plate 33 from the spray 35.  The tube plate 33 is cooled by the cooling medium in the chamber 32.  Thus, when a gas supplied to the chamber 31 is in contact with the tube plate 33, acrylic acid in the gas is easily condensed, and a liquid of acrylic acid without the polymerization inhibitor forms on the tube plate 33.  That is, the top face of the tube plate 33 serves as the condensation part*<br>
However, acrylic acid containing the polymerization inhibitor is sprayed on the tube plate 33 and the polymerization inhibitor is supplied to the liquid of acrylic acid on the tube plate 33, thereby preventing formation of a polymerized product of acrylic acid on the<br><br>
tube plate 33. In the vent condenser 25, formation of a polymerized product of an easily polymerizable compound such as acrylic acid is prevented as well.<br>
Further, the polymerization inhibitor flows into the cooling tubes 34, and the polymerization inhibitor is supplied to the condensate of acrylic acid formed inside the cooling tubes 34. Thus, formation of a polymerized product of acrylic acid is prevented in the cooling tubes 34 and the reflux tank 21, thereby preventing clogging of the cooling tubes 34 and the like.<br>
The remaining acrylic acid from the reflux tank 22 is taken out as purified acrylic acid through the tube 24 branched from the tube 23. A gas in the reflux tank 21 is cooled again in the vent gas condenser 25, and the condensed acrylic acid is returned to the reflux tank 21. A gas component is taken out as a vent gas after passing through the vacuum equipment 26.<br>
In the present embodiment, with a simple structure of providing the supporter 36 at the outside of the condenser 20, the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 can be supported without bringing the supporter 36 into contact with a gas containing acrylic acid, thereby supporting the spray 35 at an appropriate position. Thus, formation of a condensate or polymerized product of acrylic acid on the supporter 36 can be prevented, thereby allowing a stable continuous operation of a manufacturing apparatus for manufacturing acrylic acid for a long period of time.<br><br><second embodiment><br>
As shown in Fig. 2, an  apparatus for manufacturing acrylic acid according to the present embodiment has the same structure as that of the first embodiment except that: a supporter 37 for supporting the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 inside the condenser 20 from above is used instead of the supporter 36; and a third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38 inserted into the chamber 31 from the outside of the condenser 20 and a spray 39 connected to a tip of the third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38 for spraying the polymerization inhibitor on the entire supporter 37 are further provided.  The spray 39 is supported at a position where the polymerization inhibitor can be supplied to the entire supporter 37 by the third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38.  The third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38 may be: a tube branched from the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28; a tube branched from the tube 27 downstream of a connecting part of the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 30; or a tube for supplying a polymerization inhibitor from a completely different line.<br>
In the present embodiment, a gas containing acrylic acid brought into contact with the supporter 37 may be condensed on the surface of the supporter 37. That is, a condensation part in the present embodiment includes the surface of the supporter 37. However, the polymerization inhibitor is sprayed on the surface of the supporter 37,<br><br>
thereby preventing formation of a polymerized product of acrylic acid on the surface of the supporter 37.<br>
The present embodiment allows support of the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28, support of the spray 35 at an appropriate position, and prevention of formation of a polymerized product of acrylic acid inside the condenser 20 even when the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 is hardly supported at the outside of the condenser 20 due to various problems such as vibration prevention or strength of the tube.<br>
In the present embodiment, employing a tube branched form the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 as the third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38 is more effective in supplying the polymerization inhibitor to the condenser 20 or the vent gas condenser 25 with a simple structure. <third embodiment><br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a manufacturing apparatus for manufacturing acrylic acid according to the present embodiment has the same structure as that of the second embodiment except that: a supporter 40 for supporting the first polymerization inhibitor supply tube 28 inside the condenser 20 from abovcbelow is used instead of the supporter 37; and the spray 39 is supported by the third polymerization inhibitor supply tube 38 at a position where the polymerization inhibitor can be sprayed on the entire supporter 40. The same effects as those in the second<br><br>
embodiment can be provided in the present embodiment.<br>
In the present invention, a position of a supporter provided as the supporting means may be determined through mechanical strength calculations usually carried out. However, a supporter is generally provided: outside the condenser 20 when the column body 1 has a diameter of less than 1 m; and inside the condenser 20 when the column body 1 has a diameter of 1 m or more.<br>
Further, the embodiments of the present invention each employ a supporter having a brace structure as a supporter, but the supporter used in the present invention is not limited thereto. The supporter only needs to employ "shape", "dimensions", and "thickness" provided as a result of the mechanical strength calculations usually carried out.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail based on examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto. <example><br>
Distillation of crude acrylic acid was carried out in the distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 4 using the distillation column of stainless steel SUS 316 having an inner diameter of 1,100 mm, a length of 20,000 mm, and 21 perforated plates (dual flow trays) provided thereinside as the column body 1.  The condenser 20 of SUS 316L had a<br><br>
diameter of 890 mm and a length of 3,050 mm. The vent condenser 25 of SUS 316L had a diameter of 480 mm and a length of 2,440 mm. A condensate flows through the cooling tubes in each of the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25.<br>
The spray 35 was provided inside each of the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25, and the supporter was not provided thereinside as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 4, a mixture containing 98. 5% by mass acrylic acid, 0.3% by mass maleic acid, and 0.3% by mass acrylic acid dimer as crude acrylic acid was supplied to the column body 1 at 90 °C and 1,300 kg/h.<br>
A liquid prepared by dissolving 8% by mass methoquinone and 1% by mass phenothiazine in acrylic acid was supplied to the column top of the column body 1 at 34 kg/h and to the crude acrylic monomer liquid supplied to the column body 1 at 31 kg/h, from a not-shown polymerization inhibitor-containing liquid tank. An operation was carried out at a column top pressure of 2.8 kPa, a column bottom pressure of 7.9 kPa, a column top temperature of 53°C, and a column bottom temperature of 75°C, to thereby obtain high purity acrylic acid having a purity of 99.8% by mass or more from the column top.<br>
Part of the high purity acrylic acid obtained from the column top was adjusted to a methoquinone concentration of 200 ppm by mass by mixing with a liquid containing a polymerization inhibitor (methoquinone) from the<br><br>
polymerization inhibitor supply tube 30 through the condenser 20, the reflux tube 21, the pump 22, and the tube 27.  The adjusted high purity acrylic acid was supplied to the condenser 20 at 1, 020 kg/h and to the vent gas condenser 25 at 995 kg/h.<br>
After a continuous operation for 6 months under the above-mentioned conditions, the operation was stopped for an inspection of the condenser 20 and the column body 1. The results of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; and no clogging of the condenser 20 during the operation. <comparative example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example 1 except that the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25 shown in Fig. 1 were replaced by the condenser 50 shown in Fig. 5.<br>
After an operation for 3 months, a temperature of the column bottom liquid gradually increased, and a difference between a pressure of the reflux tank 21 and a column top pressure of the column body 1 increased. Thus, a steam could not be supplied to the reboiler 5.<br>
The operation was stopped, and the inside of the apparatus was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed a popcorn-like polymerized product on the top face of the tube plate 51 in the condenser 50. <example><br>
Distillation of crude ethyl acrylate was carried out<br><br>
in the distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 4 using the distillation column of stainless steel (SUS 316) having an inner diameter of 1,500 mm, a length of 14,700 mm, and 20 dual flow trays provided thereinside. The condenser 20 of SUS 316L had a diameter of 1,020 mm and a length of 3,050 mm. The vent condenser 25 of SUS 316L had a diameter of 303 mm and a length of 2, 440 mm. A condensate flows through the cooling tubes in each of the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25.<br>
The spray 35 was provided inside each of the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25, and the supporter was not provided thereinside as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the distillation apparatus shown in Fig. 4, a mixture containing 99.3% by mass ethyl acrylate, 0.04% by mass ethyl acetate, 0.04% by mass ethyl propionate, 0.52% by mass acrylic acid, and 0 .1% by mass hydroquinone as crude acrylate was supplied to the column body 1 at 90°C and 4, 500 kg/h.<br>
A liquid prepared by dissolving 1.5% by mass methoquinone in ethyl acrylate was supplied to the column top of the column body 1 at 30 kg/h from the polymerization inhibitor-containing liquid tank (not shown). An operation was carried out at a column top pressure of 21.3 kPa, a column bottom pressure of 26.7 kPa, a column top temperature of 56°C, and a column bottom temperature of 71 °C, to thereby obtain high purity ethyl acrylate having a purity of 99.9% by mass or more from the column top.<br><br>
Part of the high purity ethyl acrylate obtained from the column top was mixed with 11 kg/h of a liquid containing a polymerization inhibitor from the polymerization inhibitor supply tube 30 through the condenser 20, the reflux tube 21, the pump 22, and the tube 27. The mixture was supplied to the condenser 20 at 1,750 kg/h and to the vent gas condenser 25 at 1,000 kg/h.<br>
After a continuous operation for 6 months under the above-mentioned conditions, the operation was stopped for an inspection of the condenser 20 and the column body 1. The results of the inspection confirmed: no accumulated substances; and no clogging of the condenser 20 during the operation. <comparative example><br>
The same operation was repeated as that in Example 2 except that the condenser 20 and the vent gas condenser 25 shown in Fig. 1 were replaced by the condenser 50 shown in Fig. 6.<br>
After an operation for 4 months, a temperature of the column bottom liquid gradually increased, and a difference between a pressure of the reflux tank 21 and a column top pressure of the column body 1 increased. Thus, a steam could not be supplied to the reboiler 5.<br>
The operation was stopped, and the inside of the apparatus was inspected. The result of the inspection confirmed a polymerized product on the top face of the tube plate 51 in the condenser 50.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention, formation of a polymerized product due to a support means provided for spreading of a polymerization inhibitor is suppressed in a handling device for handling an easily polymerizable compound such as a condenser or a vent gas condenser, thereby preventing clogging.
