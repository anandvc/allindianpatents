				<td>MICROPHONE CONNECTING DEVICE FOR FLIP TYPE PORTABLE TELEPHONE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
      The present invention relates to a flip type portable telephone, and in particular, to a device for electrically connecting a microphone mounted on a flip cover to an audio circuit in a telephone body,<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
      In general, a portable communication terminal refers to a portable telephone for an HHP (Hand-Held Portable telephone), CT-2 (Cordless Telephone 2nd Generation), and PCS (Personal Communications Service). Such a portable telephone communicates in radio with a base station.<br>
      There is a tendency to reduce the size and wight of the portable telephone, which can be widely divided into a bar type and a flip type. The flip type portable telephone is preferable to the bar type portable telephone, because of its excellent voice quality. Further, the flip type portable telephone is advantageous in that it has a flip cover for preventing an unintentional press of the buttons and serving to concentrate the voice. In particular, the flip type portable telephone is advantageous to miniaturization of the product.<br>
Such a flip type portable telephone consists of a telephone body, a flip cover,<br><br>
and a hinge apparatus for connecting the flip cover to the telephone body mechanically. The flip type portable telephone is in a communication standby mode when the flip cover is closed and in a communication mode when it is opened. A microphone of the portable telephone may be disposed at a bottom of the telephone body or at the flip cover.<br>
      Miniaturization of the portable telephone is limited due to an average distance between the ear and mouth of the user. That is, in the portable telephone, the distance between a mouthpiece where the microphone is mounted and an earpiece where a speaker is mounted, should be 14cm or over. Therefore, there is a tendency to mount the microphone on the flip cover, so as to ensure the enough distance between the mouthpiece and the earpiece.<br>
      U.S. Patent No. 4,897,873, issued to Beutler, et. al., discloses a foldable telephone having a flip element on which a ring element or a microphone is mounted by way of a multipurpose hinge apparatus. The foladable telephone proposed by Beutler, et. al. has the following problems.<br>
      The flip cover is fixedly combined with the telephone body so that the flip cover is inseparable from the telephone body. Therefore, if an excessive force is applied to the flip cover, the flip cover may be broken. Thus, in case the microphone is mounted on the broken flip cover, the foldable telephone may be inoperable. The breakage of the flip cover reduces reliability of the product and increases a repairing fee.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
-   2   -<br><br>
      To solve the above problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a device for electrically coupling a microphone mounted on a flip cover to a printed circuit board of a telephone body, in which the flip cover is detachable from the telephone body when an excessive force is applied thereto.<br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a microphone connecting device profitable for miniaturization of a flip type portable telephone.<br>
      To achieve the above objects, there is provided a microphone connecting device for a flip type portable telephone having a flip cover, a telephone body, and a hinge apparatus for mechanically electrically coupling the flip cover to the telephone body and maintaining a opening angle therebetween. The hinge apparatus consists of two hinge modules each including a hinge housing; a hinge shaft having a protrusion at an end and a shaft at another end, being assembled into the hinge housing; conductive means fixedly pressed into a through hole formed along an axis of the hinge shaft; a cam hinge having opposite protrusions and opposite indents formed alternately at one side, engaging with the hinge shaft, and a through hole formed along the axis of the hinge shaft; a hinge cover mounted so as to cover an end of the hinge housing, the hinge cover having a through hole formed along the axis of the hinge shaft, through which an electric wire passes; and a coil spring intervening between the cam hinge and the hinge cover so as to provide an elastic force. The flip cover includes a first connection terminal having a plane surface, a curved surface and a tension part, wherein the tension part constantly contacts the conductive means, the first connection terminal being installed between a neck and a knuckle; and a microphone mounted on the flip cover, being connected to the first<br>

      The flip cover 200 may have a label or sheet cover attached onto the case by laser melting. In consideration of the average distance (e.g., 14cm) between the mouth and ear of the human being, the microphone 80 is mounted at the outer side of the flip cover 200. Here, the microphone 80 is electrically connected to an audio circuit in the telephone body 100 by means of a contact structure in the receiving part 105. The contact structure for electrically connecting the microphone 80 to the audio circuit of the telephone body 100 will be describe in detail hereinbelow, dividing it into a hinge apparatus and a flip cover.<br>
      FIG. 2 is an exploded view illustrating elements of a microphone connecting device serving as a hinge apparatus for the flip type portable telephone according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view of a hinge module of FIG. 2.<br>
      First, as illustrated in FIGs. 8 and 9, the hinge apparatus according to the present invention consists of two hinge modules Ml and M2 being installed in the receiving part 105 prepared at the bottom of the telephone body 100. The hinge modules Ml and M2 have the same construction as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      Referring to FIG. 2, the hinge module Ml is assembled along an axis Al and installed in the receiving part 105. The hinge module Ml includes a hinge housing 1, a hinge shaft 2 inserted into the hinge housing 1 along the axis Al, a spring<br>
-   7   -<br><br>
connector pin 3 fixedly inserted into a through hole formed along the central axis Al of the hinge shaft 2, a cam hinge 4 engaged with the hinge shaft 2, a hinge cover 5 for covering an end of the hinge housing 1, and a coil spring 60 intervening between the cam hinge 4 and the hinge cover 5.<br>
      To be concrete, the hinge housing 1 has a plane upper surface 11 and a rounded lower surface 12, for the convenience of the manufacturer. An elongated guide slit 13 is formed in the plane upper surface 11 in a lengthwise direction (i.e., in the direction of the axis Al), and hooking grooves 14 are formed at both sides of the hinge housing 1. The hinge shaft 2 inserted into the hinge housing 1 has a protrusion 21 and a shaft 22 respectively at one and the other ends thereof. An end 22a of the shaft 22 has a pair of opposite plane surfaces 22b and a pair of opposite rounded surfaces 22c, being formed alternately. That is, the end 22a of the shaft 22 has two opposite plane surfaces 22b and two opposite rounded surfaces 22c. The end 22a of the shaft 22 has a shape corresponding to that of a hooking part of the flip cover 200.<br>
      In case the flip cover 200 is assembled into the end 22a of the shaft 22, the hinge shaft 2 rotates together with the flip cover 200 when opening and closing the flip cover 200. A through hole is formed along the axis of the hinge shaft 2, and the spring connector pin 3 is pressed into the through hole in such a manner that one and the other ends of the spring connector pin 3 are protruded out of the hinge shaft 2. That is, a small diameter part 32a of the spring connector pin 3 is protruded out at one end of the hinge shaft 2, and a cylinder 31 of the spring connector pin 3 is projected out at the other end of the hinge shaft 2. An electric wire 34 is drawn out from the end of the cylinder 31, and connected to the audio circuit in the telephone<br>
-   8   -<br><br>
body 100. The construction of the spring connector pin 3 is well illustrated in FIG.<br>

      Referring to FIGs. 3 and 4, the cam hinge 4 engaged with the hinge shaft 2 is inserted into the hinge housing 1 and has a guide protrusion 41 formed upward to be guided along the elongated guide slit 13, so that the cam hinge 4 can freely move forward and backward. Protrusions 42 and indents 43 are alternately formed at one end of the cam hinge 4. That is, the cam hinge 4 has a pair of the opposite protrusions 42 and a pair of the opposite indents 43 formed at one end thereof.<br>
     A through hole 44 is formed in the cam hinge 4 along the central axis Al of the hinge shaft 2. That is, the through hole 44 is on the same axis as the spring connector pin 3. Here, the through hole 44 should have a diameter slightly larger than that of the spring connector pin 31, so that the hinge shaft 2 can rotate together with the flip cover 200, without hindrance of the cam hinge 4.<br>
      In addition, a hinge cover 5 is installed at the outermost end of the hinge housing 1, with the coil spring 6 intervening between the cam hinge 4 and the hinge cover 5. One end of the coil spring 6 is supported by the cam hinge 4 and the other end thereof is supported by the hinge cover 5. In this way, the coil spring 6 provides an elastic force to the cam hinge 4. The hinge cover 5 has a protrusion 51 to be guided along the elongated guide slit 13 and opposite hooks 52 to be inserted into the hooking grooves 14. A through hole 53 having a diameter larger than that of the electric wire 34 is formed along the same axis of the through hole 44, so that the hinge shaft 2 can rotate together with the flip cover 200, the spring connector pin 3, and the electric wire 34, without hindrance of the through hole 53.<br>
-  9  -<br><br>
      FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the structure of the spring connector pin 3 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the spring connector pin 3 pressingly fixed into the hinge shaft 2 consists of a cylinder 31, a conductive bar 32 which is disposed in the cylinder 31 to be movable in the lengthwise direction of the cylinder 31, and a coil spring 33 installed in the cylinder 31, for elastically supporting the conductive bar 32. The conductive bar 32 is steped and has the small diameter part 32a and the large diameter part 32b. The small diameter part 32a is rounded at an end thereof, and the large diameter part 32b has an end to which the electric wire 34 is connected. The cylinder 31 has a through hole 31a, formed at an end thereof, having a diameter slightly larger than that of the small diameter part 32a such that the small diameter part 32a can be projected out of the cylinder 31, and a through hole 3 lb, formed at the other end thereof, having a diameter larger than that of the electric wire 34. The conductive bar 32 is biased toward the left side by the elastic force of the coil spring 33.<br>
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view illustrating how to assemble a first connection terminal 7 into a knuckle 210 of the flip cover 200 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 6 is a plan view illustrating a state where the first connection terminal 7 is installed in the flip cover 200 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 7 A is a cross-sectional view taken along line XI-XI of FIG. 6, and FIG. 7B is a cross-sectional view taken along line Yl-Yl of FIG. 6.<br>
      Referring to FIG. 5, the flip cover 200 has a knuckle 210 formed at an end of a neck part 201. A hooking part 220 is formed in the knuckle 210, and a<br>
-   10   -<br><br>
disassembly groove 211 is formed at the circumference of the knuckle 210. Besides, a groove 212 through which a first connection terminal 7 passes, is formed at the neck part 201. The first connection terminal 7 is disposed between an electric wire drawn from the microphone 80 and the spring connector pin 3 pressed into the hinge shaft 2, electrically connecting therebetween. The first connection terminal 7 is assembled into a coupling part of the knuckle 210 in the arrow direction. An end of the first connection terminal 7 assembled into the knuckle 210 is connected to the electric wire drawn from the microphone 80 and the other end thereof contacts the small diameter part 32a of the spring connector pin 3. The first connection terminal 7 is composed of a plane surface 71 formed at an end, a curved surface 72 formed at the middle, and a tension part 73 formed at the other end. The first connection terminal 7 is made by bending a plate spring. The plane surface 71 has a hole 71a formed at an end thereof, to which the electric wire is fixed, and is fixed to a plane surface of the flip cover 200. The curved surface 72 has a elastic force by itself. The curved surface 72 is inserted between the hooking part 220 and the knuckle 210 and firmly fixed by the elastic force of itself. Further, the tension part 73 is formed such that both sides are bent so as to have the bent sides face to each other, and one of the both sides has a through hole into which the end of the small diameter part 32a is inserted. The tension part 73 is installed in the hooking part 220.<br>
      Referring to FIGs. 6, 7A, and 7B, the microphone 80 is installed at the outer side of the flip cover 200, in consideration of the average distance between the mouth and ear of a human being. The microphone 80 is electrically connected to the plane surface 71 of the first connection terminal 7 via the electric wire 81 drawn from therefrom. The electric wire 81 may be fixed to the flip cover 200 using an adhesive tape.<br>
-  11  -<br><br>
      FIG. 8 is a perspective view illustrating how to assemble the flip cover 200 into the telephone body 100 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is a plane view illustrating a state where the hinge module Ml is assembled into the telephone body 100 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view taken along line Zl-Zl of FIG. 9.<br>
      Referring to Fig. 8, when the hinge modules Ml and M2 are installed in the receiving part 105, the end 22a of the hinge shaft 2 and the small diameter part 32a of the spring connector pin 3 are respectively projected out of the receiving part 105 formed at the bottom of the telephone body 100. Further, the first connection terminal 7 is visibly disposed at the knuckle 210 of the flip cover 200. The flip cover 200 is readily detachable from the telephone body 100, particularly when an excessive force is applied thereto. Accordingly, even in case the flip cover 200 is forcedly detached from the telephone body 100, the excessive force is not transferred to the neck part 201 so that the flip cover 200 cannot be damaged. To assemble the flip cover 200 into the telephone body 100, the user forcedly presses the small diameter part 32a and inserts the small diameter part 32a into the hooking part 220.<br>
      Describing opening/closing operation of the flip cover 200, referring to FIGs. 9 and 10, if the user opens the flip cover 200 to make a phone call, the end 22a of the hinge shaft 2 rotates together with the flip cover 200 by the rotation angle of the flip cover 200. As the hinge shaft 2 rotates, the cam hinge 4 moves backward by the sliding contact with the protrusion 21 of the hinge shaft 2, and then smoothly moves forward when the protrusion 21 reaches the peak of the protrusion 42. Rotation of<br>
-  12   -<br><br>
the flip cover 200 stops at a position where the protrusion 21 of the hinge shaft 2 is engaged again with the indent 43 of the cam hinge 4, maintaining the opening angle for the communication.<br>
      One tension part 73 of the first connection terminal 7 maintains a surface contact with the small diameter part 32a of the spring connector pin 3. The small diameter part 32a with the end having the curved surface has a good contact feature. Further, since the tension part 73 has a elastic force and the small diameter part 32a is elastically supported, the contact therebetween can be maintained. With rotation of the flip cover 200, the hinge shaft 2 rotates together with the spring connector pin 3. The contact between the small diameter part 32a and the tension part 73 is kept constantly. The small diameter part 32a of the spring connector pin 3 fixed to the hinge shaft 2 always contacts the tension part 73 of the first connection terminal 7. Even though the hinge shaft 2 rotates together with the spring connector pin 3 when opening the flip cover 200, since the coil spring 6 and the coil spring 33 installed in the cylinder 31 maintain the constant contact force, the tension part 73 can maintain the contact with the small diameter part 32a with a constant force. That is, by means of the elastic force of the two coil springs 6 and 33, the contact between the tension part 73 and the small diameter part 32a is maintained constantly.<br>
      Summing up an electric connection between the microphone 80 and the telephone body 100, the microphone 80 is connected to the plane surface 71 of the first connection terminal 7 by way of the electric wire 81 and the tension part 73 of the connection terminal 7 contacts the end of the small diameter part 32a, the other end of which is connected to the conductive bar 32. The conductive bar 32 is connected to the audio circuit of the telephone body 100 via the electric wire 34. As<br>
-   13   -<br><br>
a result, the flip cover 200 is detachable from the telephone body 100. If the flip cover 200 is detached from the telephone body 100 by the external impact, the user can simply reinstall the flip cover 200 into the telephone body 100.<br>
      In addition, a plastic sheet or a sliding cover may be used for covering the microphone 80 and the plane surface 71 of the first connection terminal 7, which are exposed out at the inner surface of the flip cover 200, thereby improving the appearance of the product.<br>

      FIG. 14 is a plan view illustrating a state where the third connection terminal 95 is installed in the telephone body 100 according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional view taken along line Y2-Y2 of FIG. 14. As illustrated in FIGs. 14 and 15, the first and second hinge modules Ml and M2 are installed at both sides of the receiving part 105 positioned at the bottom of the telephone body 100, and the third connection terminal 95 is made by bending a conductive elastic material in the shape of a bar. The third connection terminal 95 has a plane surface 96, a contact surface 97, and a hooking surface 98. The plane surface 96 of the third connection terminal 95 is fixed to the main printed circuit board 130 of the telephone body 100, thereby to attach the flip cover 200 to the telephone body 100 and connect the microphone 80 to the audio circuit. The contact surface 97 of which the peak juts into a rotation surface 100 of the telephone body 100, contacts the second connection terminal 90, when opening the flip cover 200. The hooking surface 98 restrains the movement of the contact surface 97 to prevent an excessive jutting out of the contact surface 97. The third connection terminal 95 also has the elastic force.<br>
      FIG. 16 is a perspective view illustrating how to assemble the flip cover 200 into the telephone body 100 according to the second embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 17Ais across-sectional view illustrating the microphone connecting device in which the flip cover 200 is closed to the telephone body 100, and FIG. 17B is a cross-sectional view illustrating the microphone connecting device in which the flip cover 200 is opened from the telephone body 100.<br>
      Referring to FIGs. 16, 17A, and 17B, the end 22a of the hinge shaft 2 is forcedly inserted into the hooking part 220 of the flip cover 200. As illustrated in<br>
-   16   -<br><br>
FIG. 17A, when the flip cover 200 is in the close standby position at the angle of about zero degree, the sliding surface 93 of the second connection terminal 90 is separated from the contact surface 97 of the third connection terminal 95. However, as illustrated in FIG. 7B, when the flip cover 200 is in the open communication position at about 135 degrees, the sliding surface 93 moves along the rotation surface 110, making a surface contact with it, and at the same time, the contact surface 97 moves along the guide groove 214, making a surface contact with it. Consequently, the second connection terminal 90 contacts with the third connection terminal 95, thereby connecting the microphone 80 to the printed circuit board of the telephone body 100. The contact between the second and third connection terminals 90 and 95 is constantly maintained by means of the elastic force.<br>
      Summing up the electric connection between the microphone 80 and the printed circuit board of the telephone body, when the flip cover 200 is opened, the microphone 80 is connected to the second connection terminal 90 via the electric wire 81. The sliding surface 93 of the second connection terminal contacts with the contact surface 97 of the third connection terminal 95. The contact surface 97 is connected to the audio circuit in the printed circuit board via the plane surface 96. Since the sling surface 93 and the contact surface 97 have the elastic force, the contact therebetween can be maintained. Further, even in case of an external impact, the contact can be maintained.<br>
      Meantime, if the flip cover 200 is closed, the sliding surface 93 is separated from the contact surface 97, disconnecting the microphone 80 from the audio circuit of the telephone body 100.<br>
-   17   -<br><br>
      In case a strong impact or an excessive force is applied to the flip cover 200, the flip cover 200 is detached. Then, the user can readily reassemble the flip cover 200 into the telephone body 100.<br>
      In addition, the plastic sheet or a sliding cover may be used for covering the exposed connection terminal 90 on the flip cover 200, thereby improving the appearance of the product.<br>
      While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
