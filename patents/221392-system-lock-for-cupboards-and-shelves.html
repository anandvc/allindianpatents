				<td>The invention is related to a lock meant for steel cupboards and shelves. It is christened Embedded Handle System Lock, or simply, System Lock. It is unique, compact, elegant, safe and convenient. It has no handle as in the case of a conventional lock. The lock is rectangular in appearance. Inserting it into a suitable opening on the door panel, it can fit it in very easily. The principle of the device is that, for opening, when the key of the cam lock is turned, the central locking grip is released due to the activation of a pronged lever, which pushes the locking rod in. Along with this the substitute handle too gets released so that when it is pulled outwards the locking grips at the top and bottom of the door panel get released and the door is opened. For closing the cupboard just pull the substitute handle out and keep the door panel pressed to the cupboard. When the substitute handle is released the top and bottom locking grips come into force. And when the key of the cam lock is turned the central locking grip is formed as well as getting the substitute handle too got locked. Thus the cupboard stands effectively locked in three ways. There is no other lock on the same principle, working anywhere.</td>

The invention is related to the lock meant for steel cupboards, panel boards and shelves. It is christened Embedded Handle System Lock, or simply, System Lock (The word System means anything formed of parts placed together or adjusted into a regular and connected whole: this lock carries many parts that are used at present separately and individually to serve the purpose; but it is only the System lock that comprises them or brings them together under a single cover to serve the purpose most effectively and economically too; hence the name. The previous name given was Lock Handle assembly, LHA in short The change is necessitated on account of the comment by the Examiner that the name given is not precise.). There is no lock available in the market, either the same or substantially the same, whose characteristics, design wise, performance wise and operation wise, could be compared with those of the System Lock. It is unique, compact, elegant, very safe and most convenient. Various types of locks are available far and near, used for the purpose of locking Cupboards, now a day. Most of the conventional locks use pad lock to arrest movement of locking rods on the inside face of the door panel, after they are operated and positioned by a specific and conspicuous handle that is visibly protruding out. For such locking devices, the pad lock and handle, the two main components, are bought separately from the market; the rest of the components such as the cam, connecting links, cover etc are made in the fabrication shops of the cupboards. Of course there are certain locks whose handle does not protrude outwards, but in the case of those locks the top and bottom-locking rods are operated for positioning purpose, either by the twisting or rotating movement of the specific handle mechanism. With respect to the System Lock (a digital photograph is attached at the end), it is factory made and all the components mentioned earlier are contained in it, the handle being not conspicuous but rather remain embedded in the lock body unless acted upon. What is needed is to buy and install it. It has a very strong central locking grip too.<br>
The System Lock comprises a cam lock and an embedded handle in addition to the many other interlinking parts and components (including its cover and base) that make up the device. It is meant mainly for steel cupboards (Almirahs) and panel boards. When the embedded handle of the System Lock fitted on a cupboard, is pulled outwards (making an angle of around 45 degrees with its base) and released, the motion being taken place through a swinging action at its one end while the<br><br>
other end is free, after closing the door of the steel cupboard and keeping it pressed, the top locking steel rod on the inside face of the closed door moves down and the bottom one up, due to the action of an incorporated/integral cam (a characteristic evidently distinct from a conventional lock) and they get inserted/engaged into their home ports on the main body of the steel Cupboard. Thereafter when the key of the cam lock is turned, the embedded handle body gets locked as well as the central lock gets engaged with the mating door half and remains firm defeating any further external attempts to pull out the handle for opening the door. Reversely, when the key provided in me cam lock is turned, the embedded handle gets released along with the release of central lock so that one can pull the handle out when the top and bottom locking steel rods on the inside face of the door come off their home ports, enabling the door get opened wide. While not pulled, the handle always remains embedded flushing firmly and elegantly with the door surface so mat no protrusion on the door face of the cupboard or panel board is caused.<br>
The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combination of parts, will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings on sheet nos.l, 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular System Lock embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention. The fig.Nos.and part Nos run continually in the drawings.<br>
Sheet No.l: Figure No.l shows the frontal appearance, elevation, of the System Lock as fitted on the cupboard. Fig.2 shows the end view from right; Fig.No.3 shows the left end view and Fig. No.4 shows the view from bottom of Fig.Nol. Referring to the figures, 1 is the main body of the System Lock, that is fitted to the door panel and which carries the cam lock 16 and the substitute handle 21.23 denote the central opening with flap, on the substitute handle. No. 27 denotes the opening on the left side of the cover 24 to facilitate the movement of the pronged lever 15(figure 10 sheet No. 3) and 25,the opening for the central lock square rod. On the other side of the cover, fig.No.3, are 26 and 25, the respective openings for the pronged lever and central locking rod. 28 show the opening on the cover for the passage of bottom locking rod/socket<br><br>
Sheet No.2: Figure No. 5 shows the rear elevation of the System Lock, and Fig.No.6, the view from top of Fig.No.5; Fig. No. 7 shows the front appearance of a cupboard fitted with the System Lock.Fig.No.8 shows the back elevation of the door panel on which the System Lock is fitted. 20 and 18, denote the openings on the rear side of the cover 24,for the passage of studs fixing System Lock to the door panel. 29 is the opening on the cover for the passage of upper locking rod /socket.<br>
Sheet No.3: The figures here, show the mechanism of System Lock as seen if the cover is removed: Fig.No.10 shows the arrangement of the mechanism in plan and Fig.No.9 its elevation. 1 is the main body. 10 and 2 are the top and bottom sockets for the respective locking rods. The outer ends of the sockets are drilled and threaded to receive the locking rods. The inside end of the bottom socket 2 is reduced in diameter and provided with spring 3.Also the tip of the reduced end is threaded to suit the bush, 5,which helps adjust the tension of the chain, 6.The reduced portion with spring is kept inside a housing, 9.Split pin, 4, is provided to ensure regulation of the movement of the socket, 2.The description about the socket, 2 is applicable to socket, 10,also except that the tension adjusting bush is absent with socket, lO.The chain, 6,which passes over the guide rollers,7,fixed on the supporting plate, 8,and the pin,19,held by the substitute handle at its one end is connected to socket,2,through the bush ,5and to socket, 10,directly.When the substitute handle is pulled out, it swings about the fulcrum,36,forcing the chain to pull both the sockets 2 and 10,in. At the other end of the substitute handle a 'L'shaped lever, 17,which enables locking of the substitute handle when one end of the pronged lever 15 comes underneath it on turning the key of the cam lock,16.The other end of the pronged lever, 15,has a prong in engagement with the steady pin,14,fitted on to the central locking rod,30,Fig.l5 (sheet No.4)that moves to and fro inside the channeled guide 12 on activation of the pronged lever by the key of the cam lock. Both ends of the channeled guide are provided with stoppers 11 which support a guide rod, 22, that itself passes through the steady pin, 14, and has two springs 13 attached to its ends, but inside the stoppers, 11.<br>
Sheet No.4: Close up details of part of the mechanism of System Lock, related to central lock and mini door on the embedded handle are shown here. Figs. 11 and 14 show how the tiny door on the embedded handle is fitted and working. Figs. 12 and 13 show the two positions of System Lock, when it is locked &amp; delocked.Fig.Nos. 15 and 16 show how the central<br><br>
locking rod is working: Fig/11 shows the backside of the substitute handle that carries the mechanism of the tiny door panel, 31, which always remain closed. Fig. 14 is the side view of the substitute handle when the tiny door is kept opened. 31 is supported and fixed on a wire frame, 32,whose ends that carry springs 34 are housed in sockets 35 which act as hinges for the door. The fore legs 33 of the springs support the tiny door/frame while the hind legs are supported by the substitute handle's rear side. In this condition when the finger pushes the tiny door, it gives in, fig. 14 and when released attains the original position. Thus the door always remains closed so that no insects or any foreign particles get stuck in the cavity into which we insert our finger for pulling out the substitute handle. 30 is the rod that moves to and fro inside the guide 12.Fig.15 shows the locked position of the central lock 30. When the key in the cam lock is turned, the pronged lever forces in, the locking rod 30 releasing the central locking grip. The pin 14 at either end remains under the force of springs 13 so that the working of the cam lock is rendered smooth.<br>
Sheet No.5: The figures here show specifically how the back up cover and how the top and bottom locking rods are fixed: Fig. 17 shows the sectional view of the System Lock on the cupboard door panel,38,while Fig. 18 shows the back elevation. 37 is the backup cover and 38 the door panel. The rest of the part Nos. have been described elsewhere. Fig. No. 19 shows the bottom socket, 2,with the lower threaded end shown in section. It also shows the spring, 3,wound around its reduced portion whose end is threaded and carries the hole for the split pin, 4. Fig.No.20 shows the bush, 5, elevation in full and plan, in section.Fig.No.21 shows the roller, 7,elevation full and end view in section.Fig.No.22 shows the pronged lever, 15.<br>
Sheet No.6:It shows the isometric view of the lock and is self-explanatory.<br>
Sheet No.7:It shows a digital photograph of the lock and is self-explanatory.<br>
(Both sheet Nos.6&amp;7 are attached as per your instruction) The cover 24 gets automatically locked up with the body, l,when inserted. This happens when a point projection inside the cover at a lower level gets into a specific mating point-hole on the body on either side. Special tool is needed to unlock the cover.<br>
System Lock should be manufactured in an Engineering production unit where casting, electroplating, machining, drilling, welding-both gas and arc—forging, shearing and pressing are available. Experienced workers are necessary for the unit.<br><br>
How to fix the Lock: The fixing of the lock on to the door panel is simple and easy. With reference to the figures 17&amp;18 sheet No.5, make a rectangular opening on the door panel to suit the cover 24.1nsert the lock into the opening. Provide the back up cover 37 and fix bolts 18 and 20 and tighten so that the lock gets held up firmly. Now provide the upper and bottom locking rods, 10 and 2 respectively. The lock is ready for use. Working: The two functions of the lock are to unlock and lock.:<br>
Unlocking: Insert the key and turn to unlock. The pronged end of the lever 15,Fig.l0, sheet No.3, attached to the cylinder of the cam lock, 16,Fig.lO turns, pushing the pin, 14,and along with it the central locking rod, 30, fig. 16 sheet No 4 in the direction of the arrow shown. The central lock thus gets released. Simultaneously the other end of the pronged lever comes out from under the lever, 17,of the substitute handle Fig. 10, sheet No. 3, releasing it from hold. Now pull out the substitute handle. The fixed end of the handle holding the pin, 19,swings about the fulcrum 36, Fig 10,sheet no.3, forcing the chain.6. to withdraw the top and bottom sockets/locking rods 10&amp;2 from their respective pockets. The door now stands opened.<br>
Locking: Pull out the substitute handle 21 by pressing finger on the tiny door 23 at the point indicated by the markxV j£* fig. 1, sheet No.l. The tiny door goes in. On pulling out the substitute handle the top and bottom locking rods 10 and 2 move in Fig 13,sheet No.4. Now press the door panel close to the cupboard and release the handle. The top and bottom locking rods move out, Fig. No. 12, sheet No.4, due to the expansion of the springs 3,fig.l0, sheet No.3 in to their respective holes on the cupboard body. Simultaneously the substitute handle too gets embedded in its seat due to the same force of the springs 3. Next turn the key of the cam lock 16. One end of the pronged lever, 15,moves in under the lever 17-fig.l0 sheets No.3 so mat the substitute handle gets locked/blocked. The other end of the lever 15 forces the pin 14 with the central locking rod fig. 15, sheet no.4 in the direction of the arrow shown and and the central lock gets effected. Take out the key and the cupboard is now in the locked position.<br>
