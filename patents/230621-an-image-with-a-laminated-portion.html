DESCRIPTION<br>
IMAGE, RECORDING METHOD, INFORMATION RECOGNITION METHOD, AND INFORMATION RECOGNITION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an image, a recording method, an information recognition method, and an information recognition system. More specifically, the present invention relates to an image, a recording method, an information recognition method, and an information recognition system that enable easy an authenticity judgment of a genuine product with respect to a product produced by forgery, alteration, or a fradulent method.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various propositions have been made in recent years in order to prevent imitation, copying, and the like of various prints and printed paper typified by stocks and cards.  For example, Patent Documents 1 to 4 each propose a print using ink containing a colorless pigment which cannot be observed under ordinary light and is excited with ultraviolet light to emit visible light.  Patent Document 5 proposes a composition which is excited with infrared light to emit infrared light.  Patent Documents 6 and 7 each<br><br>
propose a print and an image display body each using<br>
a fluorescent agent that emits visible light with<br>
infrared rays.  In each of* those propositions,<br>
information is formed by sequentially laminating<br>
colorant layers for respective colors on recording<br>
paper or a recording medium. When one tries to<br>
record a large amount of information according to<br>
such a mode, the number of laminated colorant layers<br>
increases, so the print or the recording medium has<br>
an increased thickness.  In addition, in the<br>
recording medium or the print in which information is<br>
composed of a laminate of colorant layers, the<br>
respective colorants constituting the information are<br>
independent of each other. Therefore, the colorants<br>
in the colorant layers can be identified by one who<br>
intends to perform forgery or alteration.<br>

Disclosure of Invention<br>
A clear interface generally exists between laminated layers in a laminated configuration of the prior art. Various light beams are refracted'at the time of incidence/reflection of light at the interface.  It may be difficult to read out a large amount of information accurately if the refraction is not taken into consideration*  In addition, the laminated ink layers may be peeled off due to the interface.  On the other hand, in the case where an ink layer capable of emitting fluorescence in a visible light region (hereinafter, referred to as "fluorescent ink layer") is used, fluorescent emission cannot be observed if a black ink layer that absorbs all the wavelengths in the visible light region made of carbon black or the like is placed as an upper layer.  Therefore, in this case, a fluorescent ink layer is placed on the black ink layer to clarify its presence, or an image on the black ink layer is disturbed.  In another method, in order to avoid such a laminated configuration, regional separation of the respective ink layers on the surface of the recording medium and the stencil<br><br>
printing of them must be performed.<br>
Therefore, a first object of the present invention is to obtain an image and a judgment method in each of which, in the case where a fluorescent ink layer uses its fluorescent emission property as judgment means, the layer can ensure its fluorescent emission property even when a fluorescent emission wavelength overlaps the absorption wavelength of a colorant in a laminated ink layer. Another object of the present invention is to keep a recording density of the upper ink layer constant or substantially constant so that the presence of the fluorescent ink layer cannot be observed, preferably to enable an image on the upper ink layer to be clear at that time.<br>
In addition, a second object of the present invention is to provide a novel system that cannot be conventionally obtained, and an image, a recording method, a judgment method, or an information recognition method used for the system by making comprehensive investigations on the relationship between a fluorescent ink layer and an ink layer to be laminated for providing a novel image and a novel judgment method each utilizing fluorescent property as well as a recording method and ink to be used therefor.  In addition, a third object of the present invention is to provide an image, a recording method, an information recognition method, and an information<br><br>
recognition system capable of providing a print or the like which can easily record a large amount of information without laminating a large number of ink layers, and which hardly allows forgery, alteration, or the like.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a novel image, a novel recording method, a novel judgment method, or a novel information recognition method capable of showing different images with visual recognition and recognition through optical magnification as image judgment by paying attention to a relative positional relationship between a fluorescent ink layer or a fluorescent particle in it and an ink layer to be laminated or a colored colorant in it.  Other objects of the present invention will be understood from the following description.<br>

dotted manner with respect to the second ink layer. With this configuration, the presence of a fluorescent emission portion is hardly observed, and density fluctuation in the colored ink layer is prevented, so no conventional inconvenience on an image occurs.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image according to the first aspect of the present invention, characterized in that: the fluorescent emission property is obtained by a fluorescent dispersing element in a first ink for forming the first ink layer; and the average particle size of the fluorescent dispersing element is larger than an average particle size of a colorant in a second ink for forming the second ink layer. According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image according to the first aspect of the present invention, characterized in that the thickness of the first ink layer is larger than the thickness of the second ink layer.

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Next, the present invention will be described<br>
in more detail by way of preferred embodiments.<br>
An image of the present invention is an image<br>
formed by overlapping multiple ink layers,<br><br>
characterized in that: a first ink layer is formed on a recording .material by means of a first ink having fluorescent emission property; a second ink layer is formed on the first ink layer by means of a second ink; the first ink layer is exposed in a dotted manner on the second ink layer; and the image is formed by at least one of the first ink layer and the second ink layer. With this characteristic, the optical density of the second ink layer is comparable to that of an image composed of the second ink layer alone, and is sufficient for an image, and the first ink layer cannot be observed.  In addition, emission can be observed in the form of a dotted emitting portion when the image is optically magnified at a magnification of 5 to 10, so the emission can be observed in the form of a line-shaped or plane-shaped emitting portion (the following examples without explanations satisfy this condition and provide this effect).<br>
FIG. 1 shows an image of the present invention when viewed from a printed surface.  In the figure, a. portion 1 corresponds to a part of an ink layer formed by means of a first ink. A portion 2 corresponds to an ink layer portion formed by means of a second ink. The part 1 of the first ink layer is exposed in a dotted manner on the second ink layer 2.  The dotted exposure defines a relative positional<br><br>
relationship between a fluorescent ink layer or a fluorescent particle in it and an ink layer to be laminated or a colored colorant in it. Even if the ink layer is laminated, fluorescent emission can be observed in the form of a dotted emitting portion through judgment according to magnification by means of a lens or the like. At the same time, the fluorescent emission can be observed in the form of a line-shaped or plane-shaped emitting portion.<br>
In addition, FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional drawing of the image of FIG. 1.  In the figure, the portion 1 corresponds to the first ink layer portion. The portion 2 corresponds to the second ink layer portion.  In addition, broken lines indicate the thickness of the second ink layer (thickness of a printed coating).  Since the thickness of the second ink layer is smaller than that of the first ink layer, the second ink layer is fixed to each gap between bumps of the first ink layer. Therefore, the optical density of the second ink layer (for example, 1.40) is nearly equal to that of the second ink layer alone (for example, 1.43) .<br>
In the above description, when the first ink layer is formed by means of an ink that uses infrared wavelength light as excitation energy to emit fluorescence, the image can find use in an increased number of security applications.  In addition, when<br><br>
the first ink layer is formed by means of an ink that uses infrared wavelength light as excitation energy to emit fluorescence in the visible light wavelength region, the image can be recognized with ease.  In addition, when the wavelength region of an emission spectrum of the first ink layer is in the wavelength region of an absorption spectrum of the second ink layer, it becomes possible to exploit the characteristics of the image of the present invention. That is, the image, which is hardly recognized with the eyes in ordinary cases owing to a large printed area of the second ink layer, can be observed with a microscope or through irradiation with infrared wavelength light when the first ink layer is formed by means of the above ink. When a colorant of the first ink forming the first ink layer is a pigment, the first ink can be easily exposed in a dotted manner in the second ink layer.  The colorant of the first ink is particularly preferably an inorganic pigment.<br>
The colorant of the first ink is also particularly preferably a colorant containing multiple lanthanoids. When a colorant of the second ink forming the second ink layer is a nonfluorescent colorant, fluorescent property of the first ink layer can be easily observed.  The colorant of the second ink is preferably a pigment, particularly preferably<br><br>
an inorganic pigment.  In addition, when the colorant of the second ink layer is carbon black, the first ink layer can be easily recognized because the second ink layer absorbs most of the visible light.<br>
The recording method of the present invention is a recording method for forming an image by overlapping multiple ink layers, the method including: forming a first ink layer of a first ink having fluorescent emission property on a recording material; and forming a second ink layer of a second ink on the first ink layer so as to have a space.<br>
The recording method of the present invention is a recording method for forming an image by overlapping multiple ink layers, the method including: forming a first ink layer of a first ink having fluorescent emission property on a recording material; and forming a second ink layer of a second ink on the first ink layer, in which the average particle size of a dispersing element dispersed into the first ink is larger than the average particle size of a dispersing element dispersed into the second ink. The difference in average particle size is preferably such that fluorescent particles have an average particle size of 0.5 ym or more to about 3 ym (preferably 1 ym or more to 2 ym or less, and it is more preferable that particles having an average particle size in this range account for 40% or more<br><br>
of the first ink) , while a colored colorant has an average particle size on the order of 10"9 m (nm) . Specifically, the fluorescent particles are preferably inorganic pigment particles, and the colored colorant is preferably an organic dye or an organic pigment.<br>
The recording method of the present invention is a recording method for forming an image by overlapping multiple ink layers, the method including: forming a first ink layer of a first ink having fluorescent emission property on a recording material; and forming a second ink layer of a second ink on the first ink layer, in which the thickness of the first ink layer formed on the recording material (thickness of a printed coating) is larger than the thickness of the second ink layer.  The ink used for the image formation contains a colorant such as a pigment, and a dispersant for maintaining a state of dispersion of the colorant in a liquid, or a film forming material or binder for fixing the colorant to printing paper (hereinafter, the term "printing paper" also refers to a recording medium) after ink is applied to record information. Examples of the recording medium include: ordinary commercially available recording media such as pulp, fibers, resins, stickers, and corrugated cardboard; and those obtained by subjecting the above recording media to a<br><br>
coating process for coloring.<br>
The image of the present invention is formed according to any one of various printing modes.  For example, as conventionally known, a liquid medium for ink when the image is formed according to an inkjet mode is mainly water or a mixture of water and a water-soluble organic solvent. Examples of a water-soluble liquid medium include: water-soluble alcohols; and water-soluble polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and glycerin.  In addition, in order to maintain the dispersability of a pigment in an aqueous medium, the liquid medium contains any one of pigment dispersants such as various surfactants and water-soluble resins. Representative examples of the water-soluble resins include acrylic resins having a water-soluble group such as a carboxyl group or a quaternary ammonium group.<br>
In addition, when the image of the present invention is formed by means of an ink for gravure printing, for example, an aqueous ink for gravure printing, an emulsion composed of water containing a water-soluble organic solvent such as an alcohol, and a water-soluble resin or a water-insoluble resin, or the like is used for the ink. Examples of the resins include acrylic resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate<br><br>
copolymer resins, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer resins, polyester resins, polyamide resins, cellulose-based resins, polyurethane resins, and chlorinated polypropylene resins. The ink further contains a cross-linking agent or the like as required. Examples of an organic solvent when the image is formed by means of an oil-based ink for gravure printing include methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, xylene, cyclohexanone, cyclohexane, and alkyl-substituted cyclohexane.  Examples of a film forming material (binder) for the ink include the above water-insoluble resins -  The oil-based ink similarly contains a cross-linking agent as required.<br>
In addition, when the image of the present invention is formed through offset printing, letterpress printing, or screen printing, a liquid medium for ink used for each printing contains a petroleum-based solvent and a film forming material having an oxidation-polymerizable double bond such as semi-drying oil, drying oil, a rosin-denatured phenol resin, a petroleum resin, or an alkyd resin. Any one of the above liquid media- (varnish and vehicle) for ink is conventionally known, and any one of the other conventionally known liquid media can be used for an ink for forming the image of the present invention. Although liquid media for ink used for representative printing modes have been exemplified above, liquid<br><br>
media for ink used for the other printing modes are also applicable.<br>
The main characteristic of the present invention is that a fluorescent colorant is used for the first ink as a colorant of ink for any one of the above conventionally known printing modes.  The term "fluorescent colorant" refers to a colorant that uses light having a certain wavelength as excitation energy to emit light in a different wavelength region that does not include the wavelength for the excitation. Of such colorants, a pigment having high fastness property is preferable, A dye may be used in combination depending on applications and purposes.<br>
The fluorescent colorant to be used in the present invention, which has fluorescent emission property and is used for ink, generates a spectrum when it is excited with ultraviolet light and then returns to a lower energy level.  In addition, a peak of the spectrum is in a wavelength region of blue, green, red, or the like.  The colorant is obtained by adding a trace amount of metal (such as copper, silver, manganese, bismuth, or lead) as an activator for intensifying emission to a high-purity fluorescent material such as zinc sulfide or a sulfide of an alkaline earth metal; and sintering the mixture at a high temperature.  The hue, brightness, and degree of color attenuation of an ultraviolet<br><br>
fluorescent pigment can be adjusted in accordance with a combination of a host crystal and an activator.<br>
Specific examples of the fluorescent colorant include Ca2B509Cl: Eu2+, CaW04, ZnO: Zn, Zn2Si04: Mn, Y202S : Eu, ZnS : Ag, YV04 : Eu, Y203: Eu, Gd202S : Tb, La202S : Tb, Y3Al50i2:Ce, Sr5 (P04) 3C1 :Eu, 3(Ba, Mg) 0 • 8A1203 : Eu, Zn2Ge04:Mn, Y(P, V)04:Eu, 0 . 5MgF2 • 3 . 5MgOGe02:Mn, ZnS:Cu, and ZnS:Mn.  Each of them is used alone, or several kinds of them are arbitrarily selected and mixed before use.  Fluorescent spectra of those fluorescent colorants have peaks outside the wavelength region of blue, green, red, or the like, and can be appropriately selected in accordance with a desired fluorescent spectrum.<br>
An infrared fluorescent pigment to be used in the present invention is a pigment which is excited with infrared light (about 800 to about 1,200 nm) to emit visible light (about 400 to about 800 nm).  The infrared fluorescent pigment is a fluorescent material having an extremely special excitation mechanism.  Specifically, multiple photons of infrared light having small energy are used to excite visible light emission.  The excitation mechanism is classified into two types.  One of them, which is observed in many host crystals using Er3+, Ho3+, (rare earth) and the like as activators, is such that excitation is performed through multi-stage<br><br>
excitation in activator ions. The other type is such that Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, or the like as an emission center is excited to a higher level through multiple times of transfer of resonance energy from a sensitizer, that is, multi-stage energy transfer resulting from the absorption of infrared rays by a sensitizer Yb3+.  Specific examples of the sensitizer include YF3:Yb+Er, YF3:Yb+Tm, and BaFCl:Yb+Er.<br>
The nonfluorescent colorant to be used in the present invention is preferably a pigment.  Examples of an ordinary pigment include: inorganic pigments such as titanium oxide, zinc white, ultramarine blue, iron blue, chromium oxide, and iron oxide; insoluble azo pigments such as arylides, acetoacetic acid arylide disazo pigments, and pyrazolone azo pigments; soluble azo pigments such as lake red C and brilliant carmine 6B; organic pigments such as copper phthalocyanines, quinacridones, indigo•thioindigo pigments, indanthrones, and perynone-perylenen pigments; and various pigments used for conventional printing ink such as carbon black.<br>
In each combination of pigments, the ordinary pigment to be used is preferably a pigment having a slight or no absorption in the infrared portion and the ultraviolet portion.  For example, when a black pigment that absorbs light over an entire wavelength region is used, it is preferably used at a low<br><br>
concentration (less than 1 mass%).  In addition, either of the above pigments is preferably used in combination with a pigment that reflects light over an entire wavelength region such as a white pigment. The use of the white pigment efficiently improves the emission of the ultraviolet fluorescent pigment and/or the infrared fluorescent pigment without allowing ultraviolet light and/or infrared light with which the printed layer is irradiated to pass through ' the printing paper.  In addition, a colored ordinary pigment to be used is preferably a pigment having a hue different from the emission wavelength of the ultraviolet fluorescent pigment and/or the infrared fluorescent pigment.  In such a combination, irradiation of a print with ultraviolet light and/or infrared light provides an observer with a significantly different visual appreciation. As a result, a large amount of information can be recorded, the forgery, alteration, and falsification of information become difficult, and a false product can be easily detected.<br>
The ink to be used in the present invention can be obtained by mixing required components and dispersing a pigment into a liquid medium according to a production method adapted to its printing mode. The ultraviolet fluorescent pigment and the infrared fluorescent pigment easily sediment in ink because of<br><br>
its large specific gravity.  Therefore, they are preferably subjected to a re-dispersion treatment before use. Although a printing method by means of the ink to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, specifically, the ink is suitable for inkjet recording, gravure printing, offset printing, letterpress printing, screen printing, or the like.<br>
Examples of the printing paper (recording medium) include: securities, bills, gift certificates, cards, train tickets, admission tickets, and the like; synthetic paper; and plastic films. The examples further include a commodity itself which is easily imitated, and a case or corrugated cardboard box for the commodity, so the printing paper is not particularly limited.  Printing on the printing paper (recording medium) may be such that various images (information) are recorded by means of the above ink alone, or may be such that a specific image is formed on part of an ordinary print according to the method of the present invention.  For example, securities may be formed by means of ordinary printing ink, and only part of its image may be formed according to the method of the present invention. A fluorescent pigment is relatively expensive.  A problem associated with cost can be avoided by printing a part of an image, for example, part of a large number<br><br>
of letters to be printed with the method of the present invention.<br>
Next, an example of the recording method of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an image of the present invention when viewed from its surface.  In the figure, a portion 1 corresponds to a portion in which a first ink layer is formed. A portion 2 corresponds to a portion" to which a second ink layer is formed.  Part of the first ink layer is exposed in a dotted manner on the surface of the second ink layer.<br>
FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional drawing of the image of FIG. 1.  In the figure, a region 1 corresponds to the portion to which the first ink layer is formed. A region 2 corresponds to the portion to which the second ink layer is formed.  In addition, broken lines indicate the thickness of the second ink layer (thickness of a printed coating). Since the thickness of the second ink layer is smaller than that of the first ink layer, the second ink layer is fixed to each gap between bumps of the first ink layer.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a state where a colorant used for the first ink layer is fixed onto a recording material.  In the figure, a portion 1 corresponds to the first ink layer portion. A portion 2 corresponds<br><br>
to the second ink layer portion.  In addition, broken lines indicate the thickness of the second ink layer. The second ink layer is fixed to each gap between bumps of the first ink layer.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a state where a transparent coating layer 3 is placed on an outermost surface. When the transparent coating layer is placed on the outermost surface, the irregularities on the image surface are suppressed, whereby the print quality of the image becomes satisfactory.  In this case, when a film-shaped layer is used as the transparent coating layer, a large number of fine air bubbles that cannot be normally observed can be generated between the image surface and the film. As a result, it becomes difficult to judge the state of a printed portion from the image surface, which is preferable for an image for which security is demanded.<br>
In addition, the use of the above recording method results in the formation of a good image, wherein a second ink layer is formed by means of a second ink on a first ink layer formed by means of a first ink having fluorescent emission property on a recording material with the second ink layer being exposed in a dotted manner on the first ink layer.<br>
The present invention also provides an information recognition method characterized by including irradiating the image described above with<br><br>
ultraviolet light and/or infrared light to recognize information, and an information recognition system characterized by including the above-described image, a light source for irradiating the image with ultraviolet light and/or infrared light, and means for recognizing a hue generated by the irradiation using the light source.

In addition, the present invention provides a recording method for forming an image by overlapping multiple ink layers, comprising the steps of forming a first ink layer of a first ink having fluorescent emission property on a recording material and forming a second ink layer of a second ink on the<br><br>
first ink layer, wherein the image is formed by at least one of the first ink layer and the second ink layer, and the average particle size of dispersing elements dispersed in the first ink is larger than the average particle size of dispersing elements dispersed in the second ink.<br>

10 parts On the other hand, an ink for offset printing was prepared in the same manner as that described above except that only the red pigment (10 parts) was used and no  infrared fluorescent pigment was used in the above ink composition.<br>
Ciphered letters were printed on plain paper by an offset printing machine by using the above ink containing the infrared fluorescent pigment. Subsequently, a solid image for covering the entire ciphered letters was printed by using the above ink<br><br>
containing no infrared fluorescent pigment. Although the entire surface of the printed product presented a uniform red color under daylight, only the ciphered letters were clearly observed when the printed product was irradiated with infrared ray of 800 to 1,200 nm in a dark room.  The ciphered letters were also clearly observed when the printed product was irradiated with infrared rays in the same manner"as that described above under daylight. The ink for offset printing can also be used for letterpress printing or screen printing.<br>
In addition, information recorded on the printed product obtained by using the ink of Example 5 was read by using a scanner having a device for applying specific infrared light adapted to the infrared fluorescent pigment and a device for reading emission information (cipher). As a result, the information was satisfactorily read.  Furthermore, information recorded on a printed product formed on the surface of a recording medium by using the ink of Example 5 while varying the thickness of an infrared light absorption portion was read by using a scanner having a device for applying specific infrared light with an excitation wavelength adapted to the infrared fluorescent pigment and a device for reading emission information. As a result, information corresponding to the change in thickness of the infrared light<br><br>
absorption portion was read. (Example 6)<br>
The following components were sufficiently mixed and dispersed by using a three-roll machine to prepare an ultraviolet-curing ink. Composition of Ink 1<br>

Hydroxyethyl methacrylate        25 parts Hydroxymethyl propiophenone      10 parts Letters were printed on Yupo paper by using Ink 1 described above, and were irradiated with UV light to form an image 1.  Furthermore, a solid image was sequentially formed by using Ink 2 in such a manner that the solid image would overlap with a part of the image 1 and a printed thickness of Ink 2 would be smaller than that of Ink 1. After that, the resultant was irradiated with UV light to form an image 2, thereby obtaining a final image 3.  When the final image 3 was observed under daylight, only the<br><br>
black solid image 2 was observed. When the image 3 was irradiated with infrared light of 800 to 1,000 nm in a dark room, the image 1 including the portion overlapping with the image 2 was observed.<br>
A transparent laminated film having a thickness larger than the total applied thickness of Ink 1 and Ink 2 was laminated on the image 3 obtained as described above. After that, the resultant was irradiated with infrared light of 800 to 1,000 nm in a dark room. As a result, the image 1 including the portion overlapping with the image 2 was clearly observed.  In particular, there was no difference between the portion of the image 2 overlapping with the image 1 and the portion of the image 2 not overlapping with the image 1 as compared to the case before the lamination of the transparent laminated film. (Example 7)<br>
The portion where the image 1 and the image 2 overlapped with each other in the final image 3 of Example 6 was observed with a microscope at a magnification of "* 10". As a result, Ink 2 used for forming the image 2 was observed being dotted on the portion where the image 1 was printed.  Furthermore, the portion was irradiated with infrared light of 800 to 1,000 nm in a dark room. As a result, the image 1 formed by means of Ink 1 was observed being dotted in<br><br>
the image 2 formed by means of Ink 2.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, there can be provide an image, a recording method, a recognition method, and an information recognition system with which a large amount of information can be easily recorded without the lamination of a large number of colorant layers, and which hardly allow forgery, alteration, or the like.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, a relative positional relationship between a large number of fluorescent ink layers or a fluorescent particle in it and an ink layer to be laminated or a colored colorant in it can be clarified. As a result, even if the ink layer is laminated, fluorescent emission can be observed in the form of a dotted emitting portion through judgment according to magnification by. means of a lens or the like, or in the form of a line-shaped or plane-shaped emitting portion with the eyes. Therefore, there can be provide an image, a recording method, a recognition method, and an information recognition system with which a large amount of information can be easily recorded, and which hardly allow forgery, alteration, or the like.<br><br>
