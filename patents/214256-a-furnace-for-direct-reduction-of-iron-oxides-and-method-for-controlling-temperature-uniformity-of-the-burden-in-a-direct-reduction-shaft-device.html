				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING TEMPERATURE<br>
UNIFORMITY OF THE BURDEN IN A DIRECT REDUCTION SHAFT FURNACE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the<br>
temperature during the direct reduction of iron. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates a method and apparatus which controls the temperature uniformity of the center<br>
portion of the iron burden in a direct redaction shaft furnace thereby allowing a higher<br>
amount of hydrocarbons to be used throughout the reduction process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The production of direct reduced iron in both. hot and cold discharge plants oocure<br>
in a vertical shaft furnace and involves reduction of iron ore or iron oxide as it moves<br>
downwardly in a reduction zone of a vertical shaft furnace through which is passed a<br>
suitable hot reducing gas, known as bustle gas. Bustle gas, which is principally composed<br>
of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is introduced to the shaft furnace at temperatures in the<br>
range of about 700°C to about 1100oC. The ore is charged at the top of the furnace and<br>
caused to flow downwardly through the reduction zone wherein it is reduced by healed<br>
reducing gas which flows upwardly through the furnace, after which the reduced ore flows<br>
into and downwardly through the transition zone to be carburized if desired. For cool<br>
discharge plants, after passing through the reduction zone, the ore is cooled in a cooling<br>
zone through which is passed a gaseous coolant at a temperature below about 200oC<br>
Typically, in a cool discharge furnace, both the reducing gas and cooling gas are re-<br>
circulated, optionally in closed loops, to which streams of fresh (i,e, "make-up") reducing<br>
gas are added and from which streams of spent gas are removed.<br>
The reducing gas being fed to the reduction zone of the furnace is typically at an<br>
elevated temperature, which is required by reaction kinetics. The reducing gas is caused to<br>

WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
contact the downwardly moving iron ore to reduce the iron oxides therein according to the<br>
following basic reactions:<br>
(1) 3Fe2O3 + H2/CO=&gt;2Fe1O4 + H2O/CO2<br>
(2) Fe3OH + H2/CO =&gt; 3feO + H2O/CO2<br>
(3) FeO + H2/CO=&gt;Fe + H2O/CO2<br>
In the production of direct reduced iron (DRI), it is desirable to increase the product<br>
carburization and to increase in-situ reforming in the lower portion of both hot and cold<br>
direct reduction furnaces by injecting hy drocarbons. This is a proven means to increase the<br>
productivity of direct reduction furnaces without adding new equipment to increase reducing<br>
gas capacity. This is also a proven means to increase product carbon. The hydrocarbons<br>
react with the hot DRL, depositing carbon and Liberating hydrogen gas. However, the<br>
reaction of the hydrocarbons to form carbon and hydrogen is endothermic. Thus, the newly<br>
formed cool hydrogen gas flows upward through the center of the furnace (called npflow),<br>
cooling the descending iron material. Because of temperature considerations, the amount<br>
of hydrocarbons that can be added to the lower portion of the furnace is limited by either<br>
low center bed temperature or low product discharge temperature.<br>
As more hydrocarbons are added to the lower portion of the furnace, cooled<br>
hydrogen gas is produced which rises into the reduction zone and the center bed temperature<br>
decreases, thus reducing reaction kinetics. The desired temperature of the burden is above<br>
650oC. When the temperature of the burdcn is reduced to the range of 625-650°C, the<br>
average product metallization begins to stop because the material in the center of the<br>
furnace is not properly reduced/metallited. Also, in hot discharge, furnaces, product<br>
discharge temperature must be maintained above about 700°C for proper subsequent<br>
briqueting. For hot transport applications, higher discharge temperature of the DRI makes<br>
more sensible heat available in the melter ,thus reducing the power required for melting. As<br>
hydrocarbons are added to the lower postal of a hot discharge furnace, it is possible that<br>
tha average product temoperature will bebelow 700°C before the center bed temperature<br>
reaches the point that metallization drops significantly.<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
To date, several techniques have been used to allow higher flows of hydrocarbons<br>
to the furnace lower cone, to extend the limits noted above, and to control the temperature<br>
of the burden. For cold discharge furnaces, some examples of techniques being used are<br>
cooling zone bleed and simplified center injection. However, prior, art center injection<br>
techniques lack means to control or measure hydrocarbon or reducing gas flow into the<br>
center injection system and lack means to force flow into the center injection line.<br>
Another technique for temperature and carbon control which has been employed is<br>
the injecting of cold natural gas into the direct reduction furnace. The natural gas mixes<br>
with other gases already present in the furnace and is heated by the gas and solids already<br>
present in the furnace. As the hydrocarbons in the natural gas are heated, they crack to form<br>
H2 and deposit carbon on the product or they are reformed by reaction with H2O and CO2<br>
in the gas furnace to make additional H2 and CO, The present limitation on the injection of<br>
natural gas is temperature. As more cold natural gas is injected, the center bed temperature<br>
decreases, which decreases the rate of reaction kinetics. At low flow rates of the cold<br>
natural gas, the production benefit from additional reducing gases will outweigh the<br>
disadvantage from decreased reaction kinetics. But when the temperatures in the center bed<br>
decrease to a certain point, any further production benefit from additional reducing gases<br>
will be negated by the decrease in reaction kinetics. This limits the amount of natural gas<br>
that can be added to the furnace for in situ cracking and reforming,<br>
What is therefore needed is a means and method for increasing the amount of<br>
hydrocarbon gas supplied to the transition zone and/of cooling section of a direct reduction<br>
furnace while maintaining the temperature of the central reaction zone of the direct<br>
reduction furnace at a temperature favorable to the direct reduction of iron.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus which controls the<br>
temperature uniformity of the center portion of the iron burden in a direct reduction shaft<br>
furnace thereby allowing a higher amount of hydrocarbons to be used in the cooling zone.<br>

The invention is an efficient improvement of existing methods, particularly, the Midrex<br>
method and apparatus for direct reduction of iron which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Typically, the center portion of iron bearing material in the burden of a direct reduction<br>
furnace is cooler than the rest of the burden due to upflowing gases which, is injected into<br>
the lower cooling section of the furnace and rises upwardly into the center portion of the<br>
reducing section of the furnace. By increasing the temperature of the burden in the center<br>
portion of the furnace, the iron is reduced under much more favorable conditions. Thus, the<br>
present invention is advantageous to achieve the objects stated herein.<br>
Disclosed herein are methods for heating the center region of the furnace,<br>
particularly the burdeen. In a first embodiment of the invention a hydrocarbon gas used in<br>
direct reduction may be preheated, which increases the temperature of the upflowing gas as<br>
it flows upwardly into the center of the burden. Alternatively, a portion of the upflowing<br>
gas may be removed before it enters the reduction zone of the furnace. The removed<br>
upflowing gas, known as hot bleed gas, may be ducted to a top gas scrubber of the furnace<br>
or msy be mixed with the main reducing gas stream of the furnace for reintroduction to the<br>
furnace. Alternatively, hot reducing gas may be directly injected into the center portion of<br>
the burden, offsetting the effect of the upflowing gases. The center injected hot reducing<br>
gas may be split off from the maia reducing gas stream or may be generated by a partial<br>
oxidation reactor. Finally, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the above<br>
noted embodiment may be employed individually or in combination depending on the DRI<br>
plant facility,<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus<br>
for controlling temperature uniformity in the burden of a direct reduction shaft furnace.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present indention provides a method and apparatus which controls the<br>
temperature uniformity of the center portion of the iron burden in a direct reduction shaft<br>
furnace thereby allowing a higher amount of hydrocarbons to be used throughout the<br>
reduction process. The invention is an efficient improvement of existing methods,<br>
particularly, the Midrex process and apparatus for direct reduction of iron. The Midrex<br>
process and apparatus far direct reduction is disclosed in U.S. Pat No. 3,748,120 entitled<br>
"Method of Reducing Iron Oxide to Metallic Iron," U.S. Pat. No, 3,749,386 entitled<br>

which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>

WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br><br>
cool discharge plants, It is to be understood that the present, invention is applicable to both<br>
hot and cool DR plants, however, for the case of visualization, a cool discharge plant is<br>
shown. The system 10 of  FIG- 1 is a typical commercially available system used in many<br>
Direct Reduction Iron (DRI) plants. The system 10 includes a shaft furnace 12 having a<br>
refractory lining and generally having a feed hopper 14 from which iron ore 16 is fed to the<br>
furnace for reduction into iron using reformed gases. The furnace 12 typically has a<br>
charging zone 108, a reduction zone 26, a transition zone 66, a cooling zone 38, and a<br>
discharge zone 110. The iron ore 16 descends by gravity into the shaft furnace 12 from the<br>
hopper 14 through a pellet feed pipe 18. The pellet feed pipe 18 also serves as a gas seal<br>
pipe. At the bottom of the furnace 12 is a pellet discharge pipe 20 which also serves as a gas<br>
seal pipe. A pellet discharge device 22 of any conventional type is located below the<br>
discharge pipe 20 and receives metallic iron, thereby establishing gravitational descent of<br>
the burden through the furnace 12,<br>
Near the upper portion of the furnace 12 is a bustle and tuyere system, indicated<br>
generally at 24, through which hot reducing gas is introduced to flow upwardly through a<br>
reduction zone 26 in counterflow relationship to the downwardly moving iron ore 16, as<br>
shown by the arrows, and after reacting with the burden exits from the furnace 12 through<br>
a gas off-take pipe 28 located at the top of the furnace 12. The hot reducing gas, flowing<br>
from the bustle system 24 to the off-take pipe 28, serves to heat the iron oxidel6 and to<br>
reduce it to metallized iron. Throughout this Specification and appended claims, the term<br>
"metallized iron" is intended to include metal such as sponge iron, pellets, lumps, briquettes,<br>
DRI or other compacted forms of reduced metal and the like which contain at least 80% of<br>
their metal in the metallic state with the balance substantially in the form of metallic oxides.<br>
Metallized in this sense does not mean coated with metal, but nearly completely reduced to<br>
the metallic state.<br>
The spent gas from off-take pipe 28 flows through a pipe 30 to a scrubber 32 which<br>
cools the spent gas and removes dust. Scrubber 32 can be of any conventional type used in<br>
live, industry. After leaving the scrubber 31, the spent gas is ducted to a reformer 44.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
Thereafter it is recycled. In addition, cooled gas is introduced and re-circulated to a lower<br>
region of the furnace 12 via a cooling inlet pipe 34 which connects to a cooling gas<br>
introduction and distributing member 36 located within the furnace 12 and arranged to<br>
distribute The cool gas into the burden 16. Hydrocarbon gas is added to the cool gas from<br>
a fuel source112 prior to a reintroduction into the burden 16. The cool gas introduced into<br>
the burden through distributing member 36 flows upward through a cooling zone 38 in<br>
counterflow relationship with downwardly moving burden 16 and disengages from the<br>
burden. 16 at a cooling region off-take member 40 which connects to a cooling region off<br>
take pipe 42, The spent gas from the off-take pipe 42 is re-circulated and recycled.<br>
The reformer 44 which generates hot reducing gas has fuel fired burners 46, a flue<br>
pipe 48 and a plurality of catalytic reformer tubes 50, only one being shown. Combustion<br>
air from a blower 52 is fed to the burners 46 through a flow regulating valve 54. Fuel is fed<br>
to the burners 46 through a pipe 56 from a fuel source 58 and flow regulating valves 60. The<br>
reformer 44 is connected to the bustle system 24 by a pipe 62.<br>
The simplest explanation of the shaft furnace-based direct reduction plant of the<br>
Midrex method in operation starts with the entry of the hot reducing gas through the bustle<br>
system 24 at the periphery of the reduction zone 26. The iron oxide burden 16 descends<br>
through the reduction zone 26 while the reducing gas ascends from the bottom of the<br>
reducing zone 26 through the iron oxide burden 16, reducing the burden 16 in the process,<br>
and exiting the shaft furnace 12 through an off-take 23 above stockline 64 of the burden 16.<br>
The reducing gases can be externally generated or result from reactions within the shaft<br>
furnace 12.<br>
The metallized iron 16 then descends through the furnace transition zone 66 to the<br>
cooling zone 38 and to the discharge zone 110, which may result in either a hot or cold<br>
product, depending on the equipment installed. Additionally, the iron bearing material 16<br>
can be further reacted with hydrocarbon gases in either the transition zone 66 or the cooling<br>
zone 38 to increase the carbon content of the product being discharged. This has proven to<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
be a significant issue in steel production today. Higher carbon content in the metallized<br>
product, DRI, offers the steelmaker significant savings by substituting oxidation of carbon<br>
for electric energy in melting. The hydrocarbon gases can be and typically are added at<br>
various locations in the transition zone 66 or cooling zone 38 from fuel sources 114 and 112<br>
respectively.<br>
As a result of the addition of  these, hydrocarbon, gases there is an ascending gas-flow,<br>
equal to or greater than the quantity of hydrocarbon gases added, which flow up through the<br>
center of the furnace 12 all the way to the stockline 64 if no other steps are taken. This also<br>
holds true for lower seat leg gases, but they are usually very small in relative volume. The<br>
stream of reacted hydrocarbons is colder and of different quality than the reducing gases<br>
entering at the bustle 24 and results in lower burden temperatures in the central area of the<br>
furnace 12. Since temperature and quality directly affect the kinetics of reduction, the<br>
degree nf metallization reached by the burden 16 descending in the central furnace area is<br>
different than that of the remainder of the furnace 12. limiting this variation in furnace<br>
metallization is very important to the optimization of the plant. The reaction of the<br>
hydrocarbon gases is very beneficial and efficient energy wiseT but the loss of metallization<br>
in the central furnace burden can be significant if it is ignored.<br>
Generally, normal bustle gas temperature ranges from 700-1100oC. Center bed<br>
temperature, in both not and cold discharge plants, ranges from about 600 to about 800oC.<br>
Providing a small flow of high temperature reducing gas to the center of the furnace 12<br>
raises the center bed temperature. In typical operation of a direct reduction furnace, the<br>
bustle gas stream enters from the periphery of the furnace 12. Referring now to Figures 2<br>
and 3, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown. The invented apparatus<br>
and method provides a means of injection of hot reducing gases into the center of a direct<br>
reduction furnace 12 so that temperature within the center of the burden 16 is maintained<br>
within a preferred range. In accordance with this invention, the hot reducing gas is ducted<br>
to the vertical centerline of time furnace 12 -where it is allowed to mix with the upflowing<br>

WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
invented apparatus and method is applicable to shaft furnaces discharging either hot or cold<br>
metallized product. The source of the hot reducing gas may be from either a reformer 44<br>
or a partial oxidation reactor 44(a) sucb as the OXY+ system as disclosed in U.S, Pal, No.<br>
5,997,596 entitled "Oxygen Fuel Boost Reformer Process and Apparatus".<br>
In accordance with Figure 2, prior to entering the furnace 12, a portion of the high<br>
temperature bustle gas stream is split-off and injected into the center of the furnace 12. A<br>
variable or fixed restriction device 68 is used to provide adequate pressure drop to force the<br>
bustle gas to flow through the center injection line 116, The flow rate of hot bustle gas<br>
through the center injection line 116 is preferably measured using a venturi 44(b), however,<br>
other suitable measuring means may be used.<br>
In accordance with Figure 3, a partial oxidation reactor 44(a) or multiple reactors<br>
generate the hot reducing gas which is then ducted to the center of the furnace 12,<br>
eliminating the need to divert a small portion of hot bustle gas to the center of the furnace<br>
12. In ganeral the partial oxygen reactor44(a)burns oxygen 70 and a hydrocarbon  fuel 72<br>
such as natural gas to produce a high quality, high temperature reducing gas. This gas is<br>
well suited to use for center injection into a direct reduction furnace 12. Since the quantity<br>
and ratio of oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel are tightly controlled for propey combastion in the<br>
oxidation reactor 44(a), the mechanism to vary the flow rate of center injection gas may<br>
easily be built into the partial oxidation reactor 44(a) design.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention in accordance with FIG. 4, preheated<br>
natural gas 74 is added to a plurality of nozzles 76, 78,  80, respectively, which are located<br>
around the periphery of the transition zone 66 or the discharge zone 110 and which are not<br>
used for cooling so as to increase the amount of hydrocarbons used within the lower cone<br>
82 of the furnace l2 whie maintaining an adequate center furnace temperature. This entails<br>
preheating a hydrocarbon stream and adding the preheated hydrocarbon stream to any of the<br>
plurality of nozzles 76, 78, 80 which are not used for cooling of the direct reduced iron.<br>
When preheated natural gas 74 is injected into non-cooling inlets 76, 73, 80 of the furnace<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
12, additional energy is shifted to the furnace 12 and uniformity of burden 16 temperatures<br>
is improved.<br>
The apparatus includes a heat exchanger 84 to preheat the natural gas 74 before<br>
injecting it into the direct, reduction furnace 12. Hot flue gas frorn a combustion process  is<br>
supplied to the beat exchanger 84 to preheat the natural gas 74 stream. The flue gas may be<br>
from a reformer 86 or from any other source of combustion flue gases. The temperature to<br>
which the natural gas 74 is preheated is typically up to 450oC, although the temperature is<br>
only limited at the upper end by cracking of the heated gas. That is, the preheat temperature<br>
must be lower than the temperature at which cracking of the natural gas 74 would present<br>
problems with carbon deposition in the heat exchanger 84 or piping. It will be appreciated<br>
by those of skilled in the art that the preheat temperature can be as high as 550°C depending<br>
upon the composition of the preheated gas and its tendency to crack.<br>
Alternatively, the natural gas 74 is mixed with H2, H2O, CO2 or any other gas that<br>
contains H2 H2O and/or CO2 before the preheating stage. Addition of any of these gases<br>
will decrease the partial pressure of the hydrocarbons and thus, their tendency to crack<br>
during or after preheating. The addition of H 2 directly decreases the tendency of<br>
hydrocarbons to crack. H2O and/or CO2 directly decreases the tendency of any H2 and CO<br>
to form carbon. With the addition of these gases the preheat temperature limit may be raised<br>
to 700°C<br>
The invented method and apparatus allows more natural gas 74 to be injected into<br>
the furnace 12 before the furnace temperatures cool to the point where any further<br>
production benefit from additional reducing gasses will be negated by the decrease in<br>
reaction kinetics. Adding more natural gas 74, because it is hot, increasses situ reforming,<br>
and cracking, thereby increasing the amount of reducing gas in the direct reduction furnace<br>
12, which results in a higher production rate from the direct reduction furnace 12.<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention and referring to FIGs. 5 and 6,<br>
an outlet 28 is provided for the upflowing gases that cool the center of the burden 16. This<br>
technique is known as "hot cone bleeding". The upflowing gas once collected can be<br>
contained in the collected stream. This effectively redistributes the collected gas stream in<br>
the full reducing, gas flow at the furnace bustle 24, eliminating its effect on the center bed.<br>
Limiting the quantity of upflowing gas from the discharge zone 110 to the reducing<br>
zone 26 has been used for many years to limit the temperature variation or loss in the central<br>
burden 16. With a cold discharge plant, where a recirculating stream of gas is used to cool<br>
the metallised product before discharge, a method called "Cooling Zone Bleed" has been<br>
used for over 25 years to accomplish this control. The methods of bleeding have changed<br>
to take advantage of the hydrocarbon reactions from the natural gas additions to the cooling<br>
gas stream, but the basic control objective remains keeping the temperature of the central<br>
furnace burden 16 above a certain minimum. Historically, however, if a particular furnace<br>
12 had no coaling gas recirculating stream (i.e. hot discharge), the use of a cooling zone<br>
bleed was not available.<br>
The invented method and apparatus for providing a hot cone bleed removes<br>
upflowing gas from the transition zone 66 of the furnace 12 and reintroduces the gas, as<br>
reducing gas, to the upper section or reducing zone 26 of the furnace 12. The upflo wing gas,<br>
once collected, may be injected at one, or several location in the pieces in order to take,<br>
advantage of the reducing gases contained in the collected gas stream. Mixing the collected<br>
gas stream with the main reducing gas stream effectively redistributes the collected gas<br>
stream in the full reducing gas flow at the furnace bustle 24, Thus, the cooling effect of the<br>
gas stream is distributed throughout the furnace 12 by the main reducing gas stream,<br>
eliminating the concentrated cooling effect at the center of the furnace bed.<br>
By reducing the amount of upflowing gas in the center of the furnace 12, higher bed<br>
temperatures are maintained, thus increasing reaction kinetics. The upflowing gas that is<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
removed is rich in reducing gas and is recycled back to the process through either the top<br>
gas scrubber 88 of the furnace 12 or the main reducing gas stream leading to the furnace 12,<br>
Preferably, the invented apparatus has a plurality of gas off-take pipes 90 and 92<br>
which extend into the furnace 12 in the trransition zone 66, The pipes 90 and 92 have slots<br>
or openings 94 which face downwards toward the discharge zone 110. Upflow gas from the<br>
discharge zone 110 is drawn through the slots 94 into the pipes 90 and 92. Once the upflow<br>
gas exite the furnace 12, it is referred to as hot cone bleed gas because it is removed from<br>
lower cone 82 of the furnace. The gas drawn into each pipe 90 and 92 is sent through a<br>
venturi 96 to provide some initial coolng and scrubbing. The gas then passes through<br>
quenched pack type scrubbers 98 and 100 for further cooling and scrubbing. Flow control<br>
valves 102 and 104, located down stream from the scrubbers 98 and 100, control the flow<br>
rate of gas exiting the scrubbers 98 and 100, and therefore control the amount of gas drawn<br>
into pipes 90 and 92 from the cooling zone 38 of the furnace 12.<br>
The cool and clean hot cone bleedgas can be returned to the furnace 12 in one of two<br>
locations. As shown in Figure 5, the hot cone bleed gas can be routed to the top gas<br>
scrubber 38 of the furnace 12 so that the gas is injected underneath the packing of the<br>
scrubbers 98 and 100, similar to process gas recycle. The hot cone bleed gas exiting the<br>
furnace 12 is at a higher pressure than the top gas scrubber 88, so the system is natural flow.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Figure 6, the cool and clean hot cone bleed gas can be<br>
compressed by a compiessor 106 and delivered directly to a bustle gas duct 24 for injection<br>
into the furnace reduction zone 26.<br>
Since hot cone bleed can be adjusted to control the amount of gas upflow, it allows<br>
more hydrocarbons to be added to the lower cone 82 of the furnace 12. The amount of hot<br>
cone bleed can be increased as hydrocarbons to the lower cone 82 are increased. The<br>
additional amount of hydrocarbons to the lower cone 82 will increase product carbon and<br>
generate more reducing gas, mostly H2  without lowering center bed temperatures which<br>
reduces reaction kinetics.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/055832                                                                                                              PCT/U52002/039631<br>
Because the hydrocarbons added to the lower portion of tfis furnace 12 cools the<br>
reduced iron product, the quantity and composition of added gases will still be limited by<br>
the minimum allowable temperature of the output product, which is around 650-700°C for<br>
a furnace producing hot briquetted iron (HBI).<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any one of these<br>
embodiments may be employed, either individually or jointly, to accomplish the goals stated<br>
SUMMARY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT<br>
OF THE OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
From the foregoing, it is readily apparent that we have invented an improved method<br>
and apparatus for controlling the temperature of the center burden of a direct reduction<br>
furnace, that allows the use of higher quantities of hydrocabons or other gases within the<br>
lower portion of both hot and cold discharge furnaces so that product carbon and/ or in-situ<br>
reforming is increased; which conserves energy in a Direct Reduction furnace by<br>
maintaining a uaiform temperature therein; which provides control options to DRI plant<br>
operators to allow significantly higher levels of hydrocarbon gas additions, while reducing<br>
the temperature variations across the burden; that offsets the cooling effect caused by rising<br>
upflowing gas into the reduction zone of the furnace, thereby increasing metallization of the<br>
burden.<br>
