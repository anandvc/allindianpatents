[Title of the Invention]  BOARDING DETECTION STRUCTURE FOR VEHICLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a boarding detection structure for a vehicle which includes seating sensors that detect seating of the rider. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
In recent years some vehicles such as motorcycles have a stop-idling function whereby the idling of the engine is stopped when the throttle valve is returned during waiting at a stoplight or the like. In vehicles having this function, a seating sensor that detects seating of the rider is often provided to an occupant seat in which the rider is seated.<br>
A seating sensor detects when the rider is seated in the occupant seat. When the throttle valve is opened to start a vehicle, detection of seating by the seating sensor serves as a condition for starting up the engine. [0003]<br>
In a known boarding detection structure for a vehicle, a vehicle having a stop-idling function includes a seating seat in which the rider is seated, and a seating sensor that detects the seating of the rider (see, for example. Patent Document 1). [Patent Document 1]  JP-A No. 2000-344164 (Fig. 4) [0004]<br>
In Fig. 4 of Patent Document 1, a hinge pin 35 as the center of rotation is mounted to a bracket 33 (reference numerals<br><br>
used in the,above publication'are also employed herein; the same applies hereinafter) arranged at the front end portion of a storage box 29. A seat 32 is mounted to the hinge pin 35 via a hinge plate 34 in a manner capable of being opened and closed. The hinge pin 35 is urged upward by an arm member 39. Further, a contact-type seat switch 44 is mounted to the bracket 33 via a stay 46, a screw member 47, and a weld nut 48. [0005]<br>
When the rider is seated in the seat 32, the seat 32 and the hinge pin 35 descends, causing the arm member 39 urging the hinge pin 35 to descend. As the arm member 39 presses a seat switch 43, the seat switch 43 is turned on, thus detecting the seating of the rider. [0006]<br>
In the technique according to Patent Document 1, the seat 32 is one in which the rider is seated. In the following, a case is considered in which this technique is applied to a so-called tandem seat in which the rider and the pillion passenger are seated tandem, that is, in the front seat and the rear seat, respectively, and the front and rear seats are formed integrally. [0007]<br>
When, for example, only the pillion passenger is seated in the rear seat of the tandem seat, if, due to the structure of the seat bottom plate, the central portion of the seat bottom plate deforms so as to project upward, there is a possibility that the load of the pillion passenger seated in the rear seat is transmitted to the seat switch 43 arranged at the front end portion of the storage box 29, so it may be erroneously detected<br><br>
that the rider is seated. [0008]<br>
A technique designed to address the above-mentioned problem has been proposed (see, for example, Patent Document 2). [Patent Document 2]  JP-A No. 2002-29480 (Fig. 3). [0009]<br>
In Fig. 3 of Patent Document 2, the seat is a so-called tandem seat having a front seat 20 (reference numerals used in the above publication are also employed herein; the same applies hereinafter) and a rear seat 21 that are integrated together. The seat has a multi-layer structure including a seat bottom plate 26, a lower seat cushion 30, a seat cushion body 27, and a seat skin 28 provided in order from bottom to top. [0010]<br>
A seat switch 25 is arranged between the lower seat cushion 30 and the seat cushion body 27. The seat switch 25 is turned on upon elastic deformation due to the seating load, thus detecting the seating of the rider. The seat switch 25 is a paper-like switch. [0011]<br>
However, the paper-like seat switch 25 is generally called a pressure-sensitive element switch, and incorporates an element that converts pressure into an electrical signal. As such, the seat switch 25 is expensive in comparison to a typical mechanical switch, and since the seat switch 25 is arranged in the cushion inside the seat, its installation takes time, and care must be taken so as not to affect the cushion performance of the seat.<br>
There is a desire for a technique which is low cost, allows<br><br>
easy seat fabrication, and reliably detects seating of the rider<br>
without affecting the cushion performance.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0012]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a boarding detection structure for a vehicle which is low cost and reliably detects seating of the rider. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0013]<br>
An aspect of the invention according to Claim 1 relates to a boarding detection structure for a vehicle including an occupant seat in which a rider and a pillion passenger can be seated tandem and which is formed integrally, and seating sensors that detect seating of the rider, wherein the seating sensors are arranged below a front end portion of the occupant seat and below the vicinity of a central portion in a longitudinal direction of the occupant seat. [0014]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, of the seating sensors, two central seating sensors arranged at the central portion are arranged on the left and right in a vehicle width direction, and a bottom plate of the occupant seat is provided with left and right seat supporting portions on which the central seating sensors abut. [0015]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, the seating sensors are arranged with their actuation directions<br><br>
oriented in*a height direction of the vehicle. [0016]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, the seating sensors are arranged on an inner side with respect to a circumferential edge portion of a storage box, and a contact of each of the seating sensors is arranged so as to project from an opening formed near the circumferential edge portion. [0017]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 5, the seating sensors are each covered by two surfaces formed by a stay member to which each of the seating sensors is mounted, and a vertical wall provided in the storage box. [0018]<br>
In an aspect of the invention according to Claim 6, the plurality of seating sensors are all contact-type switches. [Effect of the Invention] [0019]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 1, the seating sensors are arranged below a front end portion of the occupant seat and below the vicinity of a central portion in a longitudinal direction of the seat.<br>
In the related art, in the occupant seat in which the rider and the pillion passenger are seated tandem and which is formed integrally, a paper-like seating sensor that detects seating of the rider on the basis of the seating load is arranged in the front seat in which the rider is seated. However, such a sensor that detects seating on the basis of the seating load is not only expensive but is cumbersome to install and often affects the<br><br>
cushion performance of the seat. [0020]<br>
In this regard, according to the present invention, the seating sensors are arranged below the front end portion of the occupant seat and below the vicinity of the longitudinally central portion of the occupant seat. Therefore, boarding of the rider can be detected in a favorable manner even in the case of an occupant seat in which the rider and the pillion passenger are seated tandem and which is formed integrally, while allowing easy seat fabrication and without affecting the cushion performance. [0021]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 2, two central seating sensors are arranged on the left and right in a vehicle width direction, and a bottom plate of the occupant seat is provided with left and right seat supporting portions on which the central seating sensors abut. Therefore, when the rider is seated in the occupant seat, the occupant seat abuts on the central seating sensors, thereby detecting the seating by the two central seating sensors arranged on the left and right. [0022]<br>
In the related art, seating is often detected in cases such as when, although the rider is seated at the position of the rider's seat, the seating position is displaced to either the left or right side.<br>
In this regard, according to the present invention, two central seating sensors are arranged on the left and right in a vehicle width direction, and left and right seat supporting portions are provided on which the central seating sensors abut.<br><br>
If the-rider is determined to be seated only when the seating is detected simultaneously by these central seating sensors, the accuracy with which seating of the rider is detected can be enhanced. [0023]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 3, the seating sensors are arranged with their actuation directions oriented in a height direction of the vehicle. Therefore, by arranging the seating sensors along a vertical wall of the storage box provided below the occupant seat, the seating sensors can be prevented from jutting out toward the front of the vehicle or outward in the vehicle width direction.  Since the seating sensors can be prevented from jutting out to the outside of the vehicle, it is possible to arrange the seating sensors compact. [0024]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 4, the seating sensors are arranged on an inner side with respect to a circumferential edge portion of a storage box. Therefore, it is possible to prevent an object or the like from hitting the seating sensors from the side of and above the vehicle. Since it is possible to prevent an object or the like from hitting the seating sensors, the seating sensors can be protected. [0025]<br>
In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 5, since the seating sensors are each covered by two surfaces formed by a stay member and a vertical wall of the storage box, the seating sensors can be protected. [0026]<br><br>
'In the aspect of the invention according to Claim 6, the seating sensors are all contact-type switches. Therefore, the structure for detecting the boarding of the rider can be made low cost and highly suitable for general-purpose use.  In addition, a further reduction in cost can be achieved due to the commonality of parts. [0027]<br>
The best mode for carrying out the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.  In the drawings, "left", "right", "upper", "lower", "front", and "rear" respectively refer to directions as seen from the rider of the vehicle.

'On a lower surface 89u of the seat bracket 89 which is arranged horizontally, the limit switch 83 is arranged so as to be detected by a contact 70 as a detection portion v^^hen the occupant seat 52 is closed and the rider is seated. In the drawing, reference numeral 96 denotes a cushion portion as a component of the occupant seat 52, and 97 denotes a skin portion that covers the cushion portion 96. [0044]<br>
Fig. 4 is a plan view illustrating central seating sensors arranged at the longitudinally central portion of the occupant seat according to the present invention, and a portion in the vicinity thereof. Fig. 5 is a view as seen from the arrow 5 of Fig. 4.  In the following, a description will be given while referring to Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 2. [0045]<br>
The two central seating sensors 72L, 72R, which are arranged below a central portion 52c in the longitudinal direction of the occupant seat 52, are arranged on the left and right in the vehicle width direction. On the vehicle side, there are provided left and right seat supporting portions 99, 99 (only reference numeral 99 in the foreground of the drawing is shown) which support the bottom plate 52s of the occupant seat 52 and on which the central seating sensors 72L, 72R abut. [0046]<br>
The central seating sensors 72L, 72R as the seating sensors 72L, 72R are arranged on the inner side with respect to a circumferential edge portion 24p of the storage box provided below the occupant seat. Also, the contacts 70, 70 of the seating<br><br>
sensors 72L, 72R are arranged so as  to project from openings 55, 65 formed near the circumferential edge portion 24p, thereby-making it possible to prevent an object or the like from hitting the seating sensors 72L, 72R from the side of and above the vehicle. Since it is possible to prevent an object or the like from hitting the seating sensors 72L, 72R, the seating sensors 72L, 72R can be protected. [0047]<br>
The seating sensors 72L, 72R are each arranged so that its actuation axis 101 as the actuation direction is oriented in the height direction of the vehicle. Thus, by arranging the seating sensors 72L, 72R along a vertical wall 24v of the storage box provided below the occupant seat 52, the seating sensors 72L, 72R can be arranged in such a way as to prevent them from jutting out toward the front of the vehicle or outward in the vehicle width direction.  Since the seating sensors 72L, 72R can be prevented from jutting out to the outside of the vehicle, it is possible to arrange the seating sensors 72L, 72R compact. [0048]<br>
Since the seating sensors 72L, 72R are each arranged so that its actuation direction is oriented in the height direction of the vehicle, by arranging the seating sensors 72L, 72R along the vertical wall 24v of the storage box 24 provided below the occupant seat 52, the seating sensors 72L, 72R can be arranged so as  not to easily jut out toward the front of the vehicle or outward in the vehicle width direction. Since the seating sensors 72L, 72R do not easily jut out to the outside of the vehicle, it is possible to arrange the seating sensors 72L, 72R compact.<br><br>
[0049]-<br>
That is, the seating sensors 72L, 72R are each covered by two surfaces formed by the stay members 71, 71 mounted to the seating sensors 72L, 72R, and the vertical walls 24v, 24v provided in the storage box 24, thereby making it possible to protect the seating sensors 72L, 72R.<br>
[0050]<br>
Fig. 6 is an exploded perspective view illustrating how a seating sensor is mounted to the stay member. The plate-like stay member 71 is mounted so as to extend forward from a side wall 25s of the storage-box supporting bracket 25L. The central seating sensor 72L is mounted to the stay member 71 with its actuation axis 101 oriented vertically.<br>
It should be noted that the structure of the storage-box supporting bracket 25R arranged on the right side is the same, so description thereof is omitted.<br>
[0051]<br>
The central seating sensor 72L is provided with a protrusion 104 that also serves as a positioning portion, and a hole 105 which is arranged below the protrusion 104 and through which a mounting bolt 82 passes. The stay member 71 is provided with a positioning hole 106 that is brought into fitting engagement with the protrusion 104, and a fixing hole 108 which includes a weld nut 107 and through which the mounting bolt 82 is passed and fixed. With the protrusion 104 aligned with the poisoning hole 106, and the hole 105 aligned with the fixing hole 108, the central seating sensor 72L can  be mounted to the stay member 71 with the mounting bolt 82.<br><br>
•It should be noted that the mounting structure for the central seating sensor 72R is the same as the above-mentioned mounting structure, so description thereof is omitted. [0052]<br>
By employing such a mounting structure, the central seating sensor 72L can be securely mounted to the vehicle side by a simple operation using the single mounting bolt 82.<br>
It should be noted that the front seating sensor 72F has the same structure, and provides the same operation. [0053]<br>
The operation of the boarding detection structure for a vehicle mentioned above will be described next.<br>
Fig. 7 is a view illustrating the operation of the boarding detection structure for a vehicle according to the present invention (in a case where the seating sensors are arranged in the front and rear), and a description will be given while also referring to Fig. 2.<br>
In Fig. 7(a), a rider D is seated at a predetermined position in the front seat of the occupant seat 52. In this case, the load of the rider D is supported at positions indicated by arrows. Specifically, the load is supported by the front flange 74 arranged at the front end portion of the storage box 24, and the horizontal flanges 75L, 75R mounted from above to the storage-box supporting brackets 25L, 25R arranged at the longitudinally central portion.<br>
At this time, the load of the rider D is detected simultaneously by the front seat sensor 72F and the central seating sensors 72L, 72R, so it is determined that the rider D is<br><br>
seated. [0054]<br>
In Fig. 7(b), a pillion passenger P is seated at a predetermined position in the rear seat of the occupant seat 52. In this case, the load of the pillion passenger P is supported at positions indicated by arrows. Specifically, the load is supported by the storage-box supporting brackets 25L, 25R arranged at the longitudinally central portion of the storage box 24, and a rear end portion 24b of the storage box 24. [0055]<br>
At this time, since the load of the pillion passenger P is only detected by the central seating sensors 72L, 72R, the rider is not determined as seated. [0056]<br>
In Fig. 7(c), a case is considered in which when only the pillion passenger is seated in the rear seat, the seat bottom plate is formed of resin or the like.  If, due to some reason, the seat bottom plate deforms so as to protrude upward, there is a possibility that the load of the pillion passenger P seated in the rear seat is supported by the front end portion and rear end portion of the storage box. In this case, the load of the pillion passenger P is detected by the seating sensor 72F arranged at the front end portion of the storage box 24, but not detected by the central seating sensors 72L, 72R. According to the present invention, there is no fear of the rider D being erroneously detected as seated, even when the seat bottom plate deforms so as to protrude upward, and only the pillion passenger P is seated in the rear seat.  The above description can be summarized as shown<br><br>
in Table 1, [0057] [Table 1]<br><br>
Pattern	Drawing	Front<br>

A	Fig. 7(a)	ON	ON	@<br>
B	Fig. 7(b)	OFF	ON	X<br>
B	Fig. 7(c)	ON	OFF	X<br>
[0058]<br>
Returning to Fig. 7(a), the seating sensors 72F, 72L, 72R are arranged below the front end portion 52a of the occupant seat 52 and below the vicinity of the central portion 52c in the longitudinal direction of the occupant seat. In the occupant seat 52 in which the rider D and the pillion passenger P are seated tandem and which is formed integrally, seating is detected only when seating of the rider D is detected simultaneously by the front seating sensor 72F and the central seating sensors 72L, 72R. Hence, there is no fear that the rider D is erroneously detected as seated when only the passenger P is seated. Since no such erroneous determination is made, it is possible to reliably detect only the seating of the rider D.<br>
Further, the seating sensors 72F, 72L, 72R can be formed at low cost by using, for example, mechanical sensors such as contact-type switches. [0059]<br>
Fig. 8 is a view illustrating the operation of the boarding detection structure for a vehicle according to the present invention (in a case where the seating sensors are arranged on the left and right), and the following description will be given<br><br>
while'also .referring to Fig. 2 and Fig. 5.<br>
In Fig. 8(a), the rider D is seated at a predetermined position in the front seat of the occupant seat 52.  In this case, the rider D is simultaneously detected by the front seating sensor 72F and the central seating sensors 72L, 72R on the left and right, so it is determined that the driver D is seated. In the drawing, a letter H denotes the hip point of the rider. [0060]<br>
In Fig. 8(b), the rider D is seated with his/her hip displaced to the right side. In this case, the rider D is detected by the front seating sensor 72F and the central seating sensor 72R on the right but not detected by the central seating sensor 72L on the left, so the rider is not determined as seated.<br>
The above description can be summarized as Table 2.<br>
Here, while Pattern F in Table 2 shows a case in which the position of the hip of the rider D is displaced to the left side, since this case corresponds to the reverse of Fig. 8(b), description thereof is omitted. [0061] [Table 2]<br><br>
Pattern	Drawing	Front<br>

E	Fig. 8(b)	O	X	0	X<br>
F	-	o	o	X	X<br>
[0062]<br>
Returning to Fig. 8(a), the two central seating sensors 72L, 72R are arranged on the left and right with respect to the vehicle width direction, and left and right seat supporting<br><br>
portions 99, 99 on which the central seating sensors abut are provided on the vehicle side. VJhen the rider D is seated in the occupant seat 52, the central seating sensors 72L, 72R abut on the left and right seat supporting portions 99, 99, thus enabling detection by the two central seating sensors 72L, 72R arranged on the left and right. [0063]<br>
In the related art, even when the rider D is seated in a part of the rider's seat, the rider D is often determined as seated in cases such as when the seating position is displaced to the right side.<br>
In this regard, according to the present invention, the two central seating sensors 72L, 72R are arranged on the left and right with respect to the vehicle width direction, and on the vehicle side, there are arranged the left and right seat supporting portions 99, 99 which support the bottom plate 52s of the occupant seat 52 and on which the central seating sensors 72L, 72R abut. Therefore, if the rider D is determined as seated when the seating is detected simultaneously by the central seating sensors 72L, 72R, the accuracy of detection can be enhanced. [0064]<br>
In the case of a so-called tandem seat, a paper-like seat switch that detects the seating of the rider on the basis of the seating load is arranged in the front seat in which the rider is seated. By using such a paper-like seat switch, it is possible to avoid a situation where the rider is erroneously detected as seated by the seating sensor when only the pillion passenger is seated in the rear seat.<br><br>
[0065].<br>
By using the seating sensor that detects the seating load, only the seating of the rider is reliably detected and erroneous detection is eliminated.<br>
However, such a sensor that detects seating on the basis of the seating load is expensive in comparison to a mechanical sensor. [0066]<br>
In this regard, according to the present invention, the seating sensors 72F, 72L, 72R are formed so as to be common in specifications using general-purpose mechanical sensors such as contact-type switches, so the structure for detecting boarding of the rider can be made low cost. [0067]<br>
Further, since the seating sensors 72F, 72L, 7'2R are arranged below the front end portion 52a of the occupant seat and below the vicinity of the central portion 52c in the longitudinal direction of the occupant seat, boarding of the rider D can be detected with reliability. This allows easy fabrication of the seat, without affecting the cushion performance. [0068]<br>
It should be noted that in Claim 1, one of the two central seating sensors arranged on the left and right at the longitudinally central portion of the seat may be omitted.<br>
Further, while the seating sensors 72L, 72R are mounted to the stay members 71, 71 from the same direction with the mounting bolt 82, the seating sensors 71L, 72R may be mounted from the outside so as to be bilaterally symmetrical about the<br><br>
longitiudinal  center axis of the vehicle body.<br>
