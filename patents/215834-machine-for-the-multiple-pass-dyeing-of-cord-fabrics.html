				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a machine for the multiple-pass dyeing of cord fabrics.<br>
A number of different solutions have been developed in the field of cord fabric dyeing machines. In fact the machines known to this date show drawbacks related both to their treating speed and their construction, which must be capable of inducing the fabric to absorb an optimum amount of color so as to achieve a uniform dyeing result. A considerable progress was achieved thanks to the<br>
machine built according to the Italian patent MI93A<br><br>
01474 of July 8, 1993, which attempted to provide a<br>
solution for the problems encountered up to that point. The contents of said application are meant to be incorporated here to provide a description of better clarity and completeness.<br>
This application notes that the machine is formed by several Overflow or Jet units arranged in series, through which the cord fabric is passed while tied into a ring. The fabric is subdivided by the number of Overflow or Jet units constituting the machine and is capable of passing several Overflow of Jet units in sequence, as many times as needed to dye it, while constantly maintaining its subdivision.<br>
In particular in the machine according to the mentioned invention, the speed of the reels of each Overflow or<br><br>
Jet unit is syncronized with respect to that of a pilot reel, while slippages of the fabric in any other reel are corrected by a controlling system on the machine, for example in the form of a microprocessor. This synchronization is possible thanks to the fact that the fabric to be dyed is subdivided in as many equal parts as the Overflow or Jet units constituting the machine, and a magnet is positioned on at least one of these. An appropriate sensor is provided to signal the passage of the magnet to the microprocessor and to take action to retard or advance the affected reel.<br>
Such a machine, while still operating extremely well in its overall concept, provides, as already mentioned, for passing the fabric from reel to reel in a sequence, from the first to the last and then returning it through a long conduit from the last reel back to the first reel.<br>
In practical terms,  this kind of transport of the fabric puts a restriction on the fabric's moving speed, to the point of preventing an adequate processing. The head losses in such a long return conduit limit, due to the fabric's friction on the inner conduit surface, the circulating speed of the piece of fabric even  in  a  machine  equipped  with  two  treating compartments.<br>
These problems relating to the circulation of the piece of fabric are increased out of all proportion in a<br><br>
machine .involving several compartments,  for instance<br>
four or six. In this case the speed limitation becomes<br>
unsustainable and the machine quits working in an<br>
industrially acceptable way.<br>
The scope of this, invention is to produce a machine for<br>
the dyeing of cord fabrics capable of overcoming this<br>
technical problem of limiting the circulating speed of<br>
the piece of fabric.<br>
Another scope is to produce a machine for the dyeing of<br>
cord fabrics capable of allowing an adequate operation,<br>
even and above all in the presence of numerous machine<br>
compartments.<br>
These scopes are achieved according to this invention<br>
by producing a machine for the multiple-pass dyeing of<br>
cord fabrics according to claim 1.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a machine for the multiple-pass dyeing of cord fabrics, comprising a dyeing vat containing at least two Overflow or Jet units arranged one after the other and associated with at least two reels straddling the same number of fabric collecting vats and of Overflow or Jet funnels, so as to pick up the fabric contained in the collecting vats and introduce it into the Overflow or Jet funnels, said fabric being tied into a ring, characterized in that for the purposes of passing said cord fabric the collecting vats and Overflow or Jet funnels are connected to each other in a non- sequential manner and in a number lower than the maximum number of collecting vats and Overflow or Jet funnel present in the machine.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br><br>
The characteristics and advantages of a machine for the multiple-pass dyeing of cord fabrics according to this invention will be more evident from the following exemplifying and non-limiting description, referred to the simplified drawing attached, which shows a plan view of such a machine.<br>
i<br>
With reference to Figure 1, a machine for the multiple-pass dyeing of cord fabric is shown and indicated as a whole by the number 10, comprising a dyeing vat 11 for an Overflow or Jet process, containing a multiple number of Overflow or Jet units.<br><br>
Moreover, the vat interior has a number of compartments<br>
containing a multiple number of reels 12, 13, 14, 15,<br>
16 and 17 arranged in series.<br>
In the example shown,  these compartments are in the<br>
number of six but may go from a minimum of two to over<br>
six, depending on the user's needs and requirements.<br>
The reels 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are positioned in a<br>
manner to straddle an equal number of collecting vats<br>
shown in a simplified manner by 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and<br>
23, respectively, and of the same number of Overflow<br>
funnels shown by 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29.<br>
Moreover, according to the invention, some conduits 30,<br>
31,  32,  33,  34 and 35 are provided to connect the<br>
collecting vats and as many funnels, not in series.<br>
The reels 12-17 pick up the cord fabric, shown in a<br>
simplified manner by a dashed and dotted line in 36 and<br>
contained in the vats 18-23, and introduce it to the<br>
respective Overflow units 24-29.<br>
In particular,  in the example shown,  the fabric 36<br>
contained in the vat 18 is passed by the reel 12 to the<br>
funnel 24 and then to the conduit 30.  This conduit 30<br>
is arranged according to this invention and arrives at<br>
the collecting vat 20 in which it introduces the piece<br>
of fabric.<br>
The fabric 36 contained in the collecting vat 20 is<br>
passed by the reel 14 into the funnel 26 and then into<br>
the conduit 32. This conduit, also arranged according<br><br>
to the invention, arrives at the collecting vat 22, not<br>
arranged in series, in which it introduces the piece of<br>
fabric.<br>
As  can be  seen,  the  fabric  36  contained  in  the<br>
collecting vat 22 is subsequently passed by the reel 16<br>
to the funnel 28 and then to the conduit 34, from where<br>
it is conveyed to the following vat 23.<br>
The flow of the fabric to the remaining compartments<br>
occurs in the same manner as described above.<br>
In fact, the fabric 36 contained in the collecting vat<br>
23 is passed by the reel 17 to the funnel 29 and then<br>
to the conduit 35.  This conduit 35 arrives at the<br>
collecting vat 21, arranged according to this invention<br>
in a non-serial manner,  in which it introduces the<br>
piece of fabric.<br>
The fabric 36 contained in the collecting vat 21 is<br>
then passed by the reel 15 to the funnel 27 and then<br>
into the conduit 33, which arrives at the collecting<br>
vat 19,  also not arranged in series,  in which it<br>
introduces the piece of fabric 36.<br>
Finally, the fabric 36 contained in the collecting vat<br>
19 is passed by the reel 13 to the funnel 25 and then<br>
into the conduit 31, from which it is again conveyed to<br>
the first vat 18,  thus concluding the path of the<br>
piece.<br><br>
This achieves the transport across sections of conduit<br>
of a not excessive length, which in no way limit the<br>
circulating speed of the piece.<br>
The transport conduits are between them of comparable<br>
length and therefore allow an identical transport speed<br>
of the fabric for the various machines, independently<br>
of the number of compartments they contain.<br>
This  solves  the  technical problem present  in  the<br>
machines based on the prior art ,  in an extremely<br>
simple and entirely novel manner.<br>
The invention is equally valid for machines having two<br>
compartments,  but  finds  its optimum application in<br>
machines having two or more compartments.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

so as to pick up the fabric contained in the collecting vats and<br>
introduce it into the Overflow or Jet funnels, said fabric being tied<br>
into a ring, characterized in that for the purposes of passing said cord<br>
fabric the collecting vats and Overflow or Jet funnels are connected to<br>
