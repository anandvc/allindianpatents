				<td>The mobile telephone system employs a fleet of satellites and a set of gateway ground stations arranged around the globe for handling communications to and from mobile communication subscriber units such as mobile telephones. Signals are transmitted between a subscriber unit and the nearest gateway via one or more of the satellites. The gateway system is configured to process telephone call connection requests from a mobile subscriber unit based upon the location of the subscriber unit. The location of the subscriber unit is employed, for example, to determine how telephone numbers are to be parsed and how to properly route emergency telephone calls to the nearest appropriate emergency service centers. Multiple location mapping schemes are employed to facilitate a determination of the location of a subscriber unit and to assist in routing emergency calls. In one implementation, each location with the service area of the system is mapped into a set of uniformly sized and shaped information cells. Each information cell includes pointers to data structures defining, among other things, the service providers that are permitted to process calls to or from that location and the nearest emergency services center. Each location is also mapped into at least one virtual service provider cell which includes service provider preferences and requirements for handling a call to from that location and including a unique location identifier. A specific implementation for use with the Global System for Mobile Communication is described.</td>

DETERMINING THE LOCATION OF A SUBSCRIBER UNIT IN A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention generally relates to determining the location of a subscriber unit in a mobile communication system. More specifically the invention relates to a method of and apparatus for performing position-based call processing in a mobile telephone system using multiple location mapping schemes.<br>
11. Description of the Related Art<br>
Satellite-based mobile telecommunications systems are being developed that allow a mobile communications subscriber unit such as a mobile telephone to be used almost anywhere in the world. In one system, illustrated in FIG. 1, a fleet of low earth orbit satellites are used along with a set of ground base stations 10 called "gateways". Signals are transmitted from a subscriber unit 12 to satellites 14 (shown as a single satellite for ease of drawing), then relayed down to gateway 10 for routing to one of a set of local service providers, generally denoted 16, which provide an interconnection to local land line telephone networks such as a local Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or to other communication networks operated by the service provider. Depending upon the nature of the communication, the signals are ultimately routed to, for example, a telephone connected to the land line network, or to a mobile telephone perhaps operating in another part of the world covered by a different gateway, or perhaps to computer system. The signals may encode voice communications such as telephone conversations or data communications such as, for' example, facsimile transmissions, Internet connection signals, etc. The subscriber unit 12 may be a hand-held mobile telephone, a mobile telephone mounted in a boat, train or airplane, a laptop computer, a personal data assistant or any other suitable communications unit provided with the proper equipment for communicating with the gateway via the satellite fleet.<br>
A single gateway may handle all telecommunications traffic within an area covering as much as 2000 by 3000 kilometers. FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary coverage area 18 for a gateway 20 operating in Europe.  As can be<br><br>
seen, the coverage area encompasses many countries. Each country typically has one or more service providers. Depending upon the implementation, each service provider may operate only within one country or perhaps only within a portion of one country. Such restrictions may result from physical limitations on the capability of the service provider system or from contractual or other legal constraints. For example, even though operationally capable of doing so, a service provider in France may not be contractually and/or legally allowed to handle mobile communications for a subscriber unit operating in Italy and vice versa. Hence, for subscriber units in France (such as exemplary unit 22), the gateway may need to route communications through a French service provider such as TE.SA.M.; whereas, for subscriber units in Italy, the gateway may need to route communications through an Italian service provider such as Finmeccanica. Further, as represented by arrow 24, subscriber units may move from one country to another Even within a single country the gateway may need to selectively route communications to different service providers depending upon the location of the subscriber unit within the country. Moreover, the operator of the subscriber unit may be contractually obligated to use certain service providers in certain locations or may be subject to other legal constraints. In addition to any contractual limitations that may prevent telephone connections from the subscriber unit from being connected to particular service providers, the user of the subscriber unit may simply have certain preferences regarding which services provider to employ.<br>
For these and other reasons, it may be desirable for the gateway to be able to reliably coordinate access among numerous service providers and among numerous mobile telephone users over a large geographical area. Previously, no adequate system has been developed for that purpose, particularly one which takes into account user preferences.<br>
Problems also occur when subscriber units are taken from one geographical area to another such as from one country to another or from one area code region to another. For example, as typically implemented, the user of a subscriber unit is required to dial a long distance area code prefix to dial any telephone number, even if the user has carried the subscriber unit into the area code region of the number being called. Hence, even though the user is calling a telephone number that is a local telephone number in the region in which the user is currently located, the user is nevertheless required to dial the number as if it were a long distance call, complete with area code. Likewise, the user is typically required to dial both an international calling code and an area code prefix to dial any telephone<br><br>
number not in the home country of the user, even if the user has carried the subscriber unit into the country of the number being called. Such is particularly problematic for users operating subscriber units in portions of the world such as Europe wherein the user may frequently need to carry the subscriber unit from one country to another.<br>
Occasionally, the user may forget these dialing restrictions and may dial a telephone number without the area code or international dialing code number expecting to be connected to a local number and instead, depending upon the implementation, being erroneously connected to the corresponding local number in the home area code or perhaps even in the home country of the user. Such can be a particularly significant problem if the local number being dialed is an emergency services telephone number such as "911" or a direct police, fire, or ambulance number- Indeed, in emergency situations the user is less likely to remember any dialing restrictions. Also, some subscriber uruts are provided with a special emergency telephone number button which automatically dials an emergency services number. Again, depending upon the implementation, the emergency number dialed may be that of an emergency services center back in the home area code or perhaps the home country of the user, rather than the intended local emergency services center. Operators of the telephone system may even be deemed liable for injuries or damages that might otherwise have been avoided if the emergency services telephone number had been directed to a local emergency services center.<br>
Problems can also arise in connection with the need of a law enforcement agency to intercept or monitor telephone calls to or from certain subscriber units. The jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency to take such action may depend upon the location of the subscriber unit— particularly upon the country,, state or country in which the subscriber unit is located. For example, the law enforcement agencies of a particular country may be allowed to intercept telephone calls to or from a subscriber unit while located within their borders but not within other countries borders. For satellite-based systems, wherein the subscriber unit may be taken from one country to another, it may no longer be certain whether the law enforcement agency has proper jurisdiction to intercept telephone calls to or from the subscriber unit.<br>
For these and other reasons, it may be desirable for a gateway or other mobile communications system to be able to direct, intercept or otherwise process telephone calls to and from subscriber units based upon the location of the subscriber unit.<br><br>
The mobile communications system may be implemented in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol. GSM, as it is currently defined, does not support position information other than location area code's (LAC's). LAC's form a portion of a 4-frame broadcast control channel (BCCH) segment of a 51-frame multi-frame signaling structure. Since only four frames are employed to encode the BCCH including the LAC, very little location resolution is accommodated. For a gateway system, which may cover up to 2000 km by 3000 km, the GSM LAC is insufficient to adequately specify the location of a subscriber unit to allow, for example, for a determination of the nearest emergency services station or to allow for a determination of whether a law enforcement agency has proper jurisdiction to intercept calls placed by a subscriber unit located somewhere within the service area. In other words, if the available GSM LAC's were merely equally subdivided over the entire 2000 km by 3000 km service area, each LAC would cover too large an area to be useful for location-based call processing. Hence, there is a need to allow for a greater resolution in location specification within a GSM gateway system and aspects of the invention are drawn to that end.<br>
Even for non-GSM systems wherein location information may be more easily accommodated, different service providers may wish to employ different internal mapping schemes for mapping physical locations of subscriber units into discrete cells. For some service providers, such internal mapping schemes may be based, for example, on conventional cellular telephone system cell layouts as defined by the locations of ground base transceiver stations (BTS's). The layout of such cellular telephone system cells is typically determined or constrained by the physical characteristics of the ground terrain including the location of mountains, buildings, etc. For a satellite mobile transmission system, such physical ground-based limitations are generally irrelevant and "virtual" cells may be defined arbitrarily without regard to the ground terrain.<br>
It is desirable, therefore, to provide a system for mapping physical locations of subscriber units into a variety of different individual service provider cell layouts to accommodate location specification requirements or preferences of different service providers. Even if the various service providers do not have distinct internal mapping schemes and instead can all accept physical location information using a common virtual mapping scheme, the service providers may still prefer or require that communications from the gateway be in a particular unique data format and hence separate service provider cell mappings may be desirable to facilitate<br><br>
the different data formats. Also the different service providers may have different location-based preferences for routing emergency service calls, for intercepting calls on behalf of law enforcement or for encrypting calls.<br>
It is also desirable to provide a system for storing and tracking location-based system information to facilitate access to such information despite the limitations of GSM and the use of different service provider location mapping schemes. Examples of location-based system information include the locations of emergency services centers or any location-based legal or other contractual limitations imposed on service providers to processes calls to or from subscriber units at different locations. In this regard it is particularly desirable to provide a system for tracking such location-based information which allows the information to be updated as needed without affecting any of the individual service provider mapping schemes.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus and method that addresses the above discussed problems and disadvantages.<br>
The invention provides a mobile communication system comprising: means for receiving a telephone call connection request signal from a subscriber unit; means for determining the location of the subscriber unit; and means for interpreting '• the telephone call connection request signal based upon the location of the subscriber unit.<br>
The Invention also provides a method for processing mobile communications comprising: receiving a telephone call connection request signal from a subscriber unit; determining the location of the subscriber unit; and interpreting the telephone call connection request signal based upon the location of the subscriber unit.<br>
The invention further provides a mobile communication system comprising: means for processing a mobile telephone communication to or from a subscriber unit; means for determining the location of the subscriber unit; means for determining whether law enforcement authorities have requested that telephone communications to or from the subscriber unit are to be intercepted; means for identifying whether the law enforcement authorities have proper jurisdiction to intercept a telephone communication to or from the subscriber unit based upon the location of the subscriber unit; and means, responsive to an identification that law<br><br>
enforcement authorities do have jurisdiction, for intercepting a telephone communication to or from the subscriber.<br>
The invention also provides a mobile communication method comprising: processing a mobile telephone communication to or from a subscriber unit; determining the location of the subscriber unit; determining whether law enforcement authorities have requested that telephone communications to or from the subscriber unit are to be intercepted; identifying whether the law enforcement authorities have proper jurisdiction to intercept a telephone communication to or from the subscriber unit based upon the location of the subscriber unit; and if so, intercepting a telephone communication to or from the subscriber.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a system for processing telephonic communications to or from a subscriber unit location is provided for use with a mobile communication system having two or more separate service providers. The system includes means for mapping physical locations within the service area of the mobile communications system to a set of information cells storing location-based system information corresponding to the physical location, means for mapping physical locations within the service area of the mobile communications system to sets of virtual service provider cells with at least one separate set of virtual provider cells for each corresponding separate service provider, and means for processing communications between a subscriber unit within the service area and a service provider using the information cells and the corresponding virtual service provider cells.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, the information cell stores information representative of the service providers, if any, providing service to subscriber units located at the physical locations covered by the information cell. The information cell additionally stores information representative of the nearest emergency services center to the physical locations covered by the information cell as well as information representative of the jurisdiction, if any, for law enforcement authorities to intercept telephonic communications to or from subscriber units at the physical locations covered by the information cell. The information cells for the service area are all of the same size and shape and are tiled over the entire service area of the mobile communications system. Information cells corresponding to the border between service areas include pointers to data structures identifying the shape of the border and means are provided for identifying the service area providing service to the physical location of the<br><br>
subscriber unit based upon the shape of the border as represented in the data structure.<br>
Also in the exemplary embodiment, the means for processing communications between a subscriber unit and a service provider includes means for receiving a telephone call connection request signal to or from a subscriber unit within the service area of the mobile communications system and means for determining the physical location of the subscriber unit. Means for determining the information cell corresponding to the physical location of the subscriber unit and means for determining a service provider for providing service at the physical location of the subscriber unit as identified by the information cell are also provided. Additionally, means for determining a virtual service provider cell corresponding to the physical location of the subscriber unit information cell and means for outputting a signal representative of the virtual provider cell to the corresponding service provider are included.<br>
In this manner, the system utilizes the information cells to track and access location-based information, such as which service providers are available for processing calls from a particular subscriber unit, and uses that information to select a service provider and to, for example, coordinate lawful intercept or emergency services call routing. Information actually forwarded to the service provider identifying the location of the subscriber unit, however, is not based on the layout of the information cells but on the layout of the virtual service provider cells employed in connection with the particular service provider. By providing the location in terms of virtual service provider cells rather than the information cells, the service provider may thereby select, to at least a certain extent, its own mapping arrangement. Also, updates to information stored in connection with the information cells riiay be performed without affecting the interface between the mobile communication system and the external service providers. In other words, such updates are completely transparent to the service providers.<br>
In a specific exemplary embodiment employed in connection with a GSM system employing LACs, the virtual service provider cells for the service area of a corresponding service provider are arranged in cell groups. All of the virtual cells of a cell group are of the same size and shape and are imiformly tiled throughout the cell group. Virtual cells of different cell groups, however, maybe of different sizes- A collection of cell groups has a single corresponding LAC. The virtual service provider cells are each imiquely represented by a service provider code and a virtual cell identifier<br><br>
code. The virtual cell identifier code is represented by a LAC and a cell identification code. Some of the cell groups overlap. The virtual service provider cells and cell groups are rectangular and the means for mapping the set of information cells to sets of virtual service provider cells includes means for storing the latitude and longitude of a comer location of each cell group, means for receiving an identification of the latitude and longitude of the subscriber unit, means for determining latitude and longitude offsets between the comer position of a selected cell group in which the subscriber unit is located and the location of the subscriber unit, and means for identifying the particular virtual cell of the selected cell group in which the subscriber unit is located based upon the latitude and longitude offsets.<br>
In the various embodiments of the invention, the subscriber unit may be any device having wireless telephony capability such as a mobile telephone, a personal data assistant, a dedicated Internet access device, an electronic organizer and a laptop computer. The mobile communication system may process the mobile telephonic communications in accordance with any appropriate mobile telephony processing technique such as, for example, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Furthermore, the telephone call connection request signal may specify any type of telephonic communication including, for example, voice communications, data communications or combined voice and data communications.<br>
The invention may also be implemented as a method or any other appropriate type of inventive embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides a mobile communication system comprising two or more separate service providers, a system for processing telephonic communications to or from a subscriber unit location within a service area of the mobile communications system, said system comprising means for mapping physical locations within the service area of the mobile communications system to a set of information cells storing location-<br><br>
based information corresponding to the physical location; means for mapping physical locations within the service area of the mobile communications system to sets of virtual service provider cells with at least one separate set of virtual provider cells for each corresponding separate service provider; and means for processing communication", between a subscriber unit within the service area and a service provider using the information cells and the corresponding virtual service provider cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
With reference to the remaining figures, preferred and exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described. Initially, embodiments directed to selecting service providers for handling mobile telephone calls based upon subscriber unit location information and user preferences are • described with reference to a satellite-based mobile communication system illustrated in FIGS. 3-5. Then, embodiments directed to processing telephone calls based on location information to, for example, parse telephone numbers based on the parsing scheme of the locality in which a subscriber unit is located, are described with reference to FIGS. 6 - 13. The, embodiments directed to processing location-based information, such as emergency services location information, using separate mapping schemes for separate service providers are described with reference to FIGS, 14 - 24. Some of the preferred embodiments of the invention conduct connection processing in accordance with the IS-41 standard, the use of which is well known in the art.<br>
Service-Based Selection.<br>
The flow chart of FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrates operations performed during initiation of a connection from a subscriber unit. The figure illustrates, in tandem, both operations performed by the subscriber unit and those performed by the gateway ground station. Transmissions between the subscriber unit and ground station are represented by dashed arrows. All such transmissions are achieved by transmitting signals up to one or more satellites which relay the signals back to earth.<br><br>
Initially, at step 100, the ground station transmits system parameters over a paging channel which identify the gateway (by gateway_id), the service providers connected by the gateway (by service.id) and any other appropriate system parameters such as satellite beam_id. The system parameters are transmitted repeatedly and periodically such that any subscriber unit in the coverage area of the ground station may receive the information. The list of service providers transmitted specifies every service provider connected to the gateway including service providers which may not be available for use by the subscriber unit at its current position because of, for example, operational or contractual limitations.<br>
At step 102, the subscriber unit receives the system parameters over the paging channel. This step is typically performed when the subscriber unit is powered-up. The user then attempts to initiate a telephone call or other telephonic connection at step 104 at which time the subscriber unit transmits access information over an access channel including access registration requests, origination information, and channel requests. The subscriber unit also transmits a preferred selected service_provider_ID, if available, and a registration bit. In this regard, the subscriber unit first accesses a preferred service provider table or other data base (not shown) within the subscriber unit which identifies the preferred service provider. Depending upon the implementation, the subscriber unit may store only a single preferred service provider, a different preferred service provider for each gateway coverage area, or perhaps different preferred service providers for different times of the day or for different dates etc. If there is no preferred service provider listed, the mobile telephone transmits the ID of the service provider the mobile telephone was last registered with, perhaps as a result of a previous telephone connection, or simply does not transmit any service provider ID. If the subscriber unit transmits the ID of last registered service provider, the subscriber unit also transmits a registration bit of 1; otherwise the registration bit is transmitted as 0. If no preferred or last-registered service providers are available, the mobile telephone does not transmit any service provider information. In other implementations, the subscriber unit may transmit multiple service provider ID's ordered according to preference or may transmit service_provider_ID's that the subscriber unit, for some reason, cannot or will not allow itself to be connected to.<br>
At step 106, the gateway receives the access channel signals and attempts to determine the location of the subscriber unit to thereby determine what service providers are available for handling connections from the subscriber unit.   In one embodiment, the satellites transmit to the<br><br>
gateway information representative of the relative time delays and frequency shifts of signals received from the subscriber unit by one or more satellites. Using that information and the information identifying the location of the satellites, the gateway approximates the location of the subscriber unit.<br>
Various methods for performing position location in a satellite based wireless communication systems are described in US patents applications entitled "Unambiguous Position Determination Using Two Low-Earth Orbit Satellites" filed as USSN 08/723,725 and PCT/US97/17378 Position Determination Using One Low-Earth Orbit Satellite" filed as USSN 08/723,751 and PCT/US97/17330. 'Passive Position Determination Using Two Low-Earth Orbit Satellites" filed as USSN 08/723,722, "Ambiguity Resolution For Ambiguous Position Solutions Using Satellite Beams" filed as USSN 08/723,723, Determination Of Frequency Offsets In Communication Systems" filed as USSN 08/723,724, and "Method and Apparatus for Precorrecting Timing and Frequency in Communication Systems" filed as USSN 08/723,490, all assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The gateway also assigns a confidence factor or level identifying how reliable or accurate the location determination is. The confidence level may be low when the location is determined using the above-described techniques employing relative time and frequency calculations. Nevertheless, the confidence level is typically at least sufficient to reliably identify the subscriber unit as being in a particular country or within a particular service provider region within a country. In the embodiment to be discussed below wherein GPS techniques are employed, the location determination may be very precise and the confidence factor thereby very high.<br>
At step 108,' the gateway determines which service providers are available for handling the telephone connection initiated by the subscriber unit based on the location of the subscriber unit. In this regard, the gateway accesses a service provider location table which represents the range of locations that each service provider handled by the gateway can cover. The range of locations may be represented, for example, as ranges of latitudes and longitudes. As noted, the range of locations may be affected by contractual or other legal constraints or by physical operating constraints. In any case, the gateway compares the location of the subscriber unit with the service provider coverage information of the database and identifies those service providers that are available.<br><br>
The determination of the availability of a service provider may be affected by the confidence factor of the location determination. For example, if the location of the subscriber unit is found to be near a border or other dividing line between two service provider coverage areas but confidence level is low such that the system cannot be certain which coverage area the subscriber unit is in, it may be necessary, perhaps on contractual grounds, to declare that neither service provider is available and that the telephone connection therefore cannot be completed. In other implementations, any service provider that has a coverage area that the subscriber unit might be in is identified as being available. Thus, if the subscriber unit is determined to be in Germany but the confidence level is so low that the subscriber unit may actually be in France instead, the gateway designates all appropriate French or German service providers as being available. Other variations and implementations are possible as well.<br>
In this manner the gateway identifies a list of available service providers, if any. If the subscriber unit transmits a preferred service provider ID, the gateway determines if the preferred service provider is among the available service providers and eliminates all others. If the subscriber unit transmits a list of service providers that are unacceptable, the gateway eliminates any from the list of available service providers for that subscriber unit. If the subscriber unit transmits a list of acceptable service providers ordered by preference, the gateway picks the most preferred. If the subscriber unit does not transmit a preferred service provider, but instead transmits the last registered service provider as identified by the set registration bit, and that provider is on the list, the gateway eliminates all other entries. Ultimately, this process yields a list of available service providers that either has no entries, one entry or multiple entries.<br>
Next, the gateway determines at step 110 whether it needs to negotiate with the subscriber unit to allow selection of a single service provider. If either no service providers or, only a single service provider remains on the list of available service providers, then no negotiation is needed. If none remain, a signal is sent to the subscriber unit indicating that connection setup cannot proceed. If more than one service provider remains on the list, then the gateway negotiates with the subscriber unit to allow the subscriber unit to select one the available service providers.<br>
If it is determined that no negotiation is required, at step 110, then execution proceeds to step 112, where the gateway assigns a traffic channel for the mobile telephone and transmits a traffic channel assignment information on the paging channel to the subscriber unit.   In the preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the traffic channel is a private non-shared signaling and user-traffic-bearing channel. The traffic channel assignment information includes an identification of the single service provider identified by the gateway. The subscriber unit receives the traffic channel assignment information identifying the service provider at step 114 and proceeds with connection set-up at step 116. In some implementations, the subscriber unit may store a list of unacceptable service providers and, if the service provider identified in the traffic channel assignment message is unacceptable, the subscriber unit aborts the telephone connection or notifies the gateway that the service provider is unacceptable.<br>
If it is determined that negotiation is required, at step 110, then execution proceeds to step 118, where the gateway assigns a traffic channel for the mobile telephone and transmits a traffic channel assignment information on the paging channel to the subscriber unit without a service provider ID. The subscriber unit receives the transmitted information at step 120. Thereafter, the gateway transmits on the traffic channel, at step 122, the list of acceptable service providers. The mobile station receives the list of available service providers at step 124. Referring now to FIG. 3B, after the transmission, the gateway sets a timer, step 126. The subscriber unit selects the most preferred one of the service providers at step 128 by comparing against a pre-stored list, and transmits the corresponding service provider ID at step 130 which the gateway receives at step 132 on the assigned traffic channel. If the timer set at step 126 expires before the gateway receives the most preferred service provider at step 132, the gateway terminates connection setup at step 134 and step 132 is therefore not executed. It should be noted that in the preferred embodiment of the invention, steps 118 -134 are only required if the subscriber unit does not initially transmit preferred service provider information at step 104 such as if a suitable service provider cannot be determined during steps 104 - 110.<br>
Hence, the subscriber unit and gateway together perform steps for selecting an appropriate service provider based upon the location of the subscriber unit and any preferences specified by the subscriber unit. Once the selection is established, the subscriber unit and gateway proceed with processing the telephone connection. In one embodiment of the invention, the location of the subscriber unit is updated periodically during the connection, and, if the subscriber unit is found to have traversed into an area wherein the original service provider is no longer available, the gateway and subscriber unit re-negotiate for a new service provider and the appropriate steps of FIG. 3 are repeated. Preferably these steps are performed<br><br>
without disrupting the mobile communication in progress. In some situations, however, it may be necessary to terminate the connection if a new available service provider cannot be found.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates pertinent components of a satellite-based system configured to perform the steps of FIG, 3A and 3B. The system is similar to that of FIG. 1, with like components identified by like reference numerals incremented by 100, and only pertinent differences will be described in detail. A gateway ground station 210, subscriber unit 212 and satellite 214 are shown. Signals are transmitted between the subscriber unit and the gateway via the satellite. The gateway is also interconnected to a set of service providers, generally denoted 216, which provide an interconnection to local land line telephone networks or other communication networks.<br>
Subscriber unit 212 includes a preferred service provider list 218 for use in selecting a preferred service provider. As noted above, an ID of the preferred service provider is transrnitted to gateway 210 either as part of an access request over the access channel or in response to query from the gateway over received over the paging channel Depending upon the implementations, the preferred service provider list may identify only a single service provider, a single service provider per gateway or perhaps a single service provider per country or area. The list may also identify service providers in order of preference. The list may also identify service providers that the user of the subscriber unit would prefer not to use including ones that, for one reason or another, the user will not or cannot access. Also depending upon the implementation, the service provider preference list is programmed by the subscriber unit manufacturer, point of sale personnel or the user. If the latter, the subscriber unit is provided with circuitry or software for receiving preferred service provider information from the user, perhaps input through a keypad of the subscriber unit or perhaps selected from a list presented to the user of a set of pre-stored permissible service providers. The database may alternatively be updated electronically via a dataport or updated based upon signals received via mobile communications from a gateway. In each case, all permissible service provider ID's are pre-stored such that the user need not know the ID'S. Rather, the user need only know the name of the service provider. As can be appreciated, a wide variety of implementations are available.<br>
Gateway 210 includes a service provider list 220 identifying all service providers connected to the gateway, a service provider location table 222 identifying the permissible coverage areas for each service provider of list 220, a subscriber unit location  determination   unit  224 and an available<br><br>
service provider determination unit 226. The subscriber unit location determination unit identifies the location of the mobile and applies that information to location table 222 to identify those service providers available for handling telephonic connections for subscriber units at that location- As noted above, the ability of a service provider to handle connections may be subject by contractual other legal constraints. Also as noted, the location of the subscriber unit is determined subject to some degree or accuracy or confidence factor. The confidence factor may be employed, in the manner discussed above, by the available service provider determination unit 226 in identifying the acceptable service providers.<br>
After a list of acceptable service providers is generated, gateway 210 performs the steps described above to negotiate, if necessary, with subscriber unit 212 to allow selection of one of the service providers. Once a service provider has been selected, the gateway routes signals between the subscriber unit and the selected service provider for further processing of the telephone connection. Subsequent telephone connections initiated by the subscriber unit require re-identification of a service provider, which may or may not be a different service provider than the previous one selected.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates pertinent components of a system similar to that of FIG. 4, (with like components identifies by like reference numerals incremented by 100), but wherein the subscriber unit includes a GPS unit for determining location. Only pertinent differences will be described in detail,<br>
A subscriber unit 312 is shown including a GPS unit 324 for determining the current location of the subscriber unit, GPS unit 324 determines the location of the subscriber unit in accordance with conventional GPS techniques and in cormection with a fleet of GPS satellites (not separately shown). The location may be determined prior to initiation of a telephone connection or may be provided in response to a query from the gateway. In either case, once the location is determined, the subscriber unit transmits coordinates identifying the location to a gateway 310 to allow the gateway to determine which service providers are available for that location. The gateway then proceeds in the marmer described above with reference to FIG. 3 to negotiate with the subscriber unit, if necessary, to select one of the service providers.<br>
Thus far techniques have been described with reference to a telephone cormection initiated by a subscriber unit. Similar techniques are performed for subscriber urut terminated connections. Also, similar techniques are performed to register a subscriber unit upon power up and  to update<br><br>
registration periodically.  Further, similar techniques may be performed for other mobile communications besides telephone calls.<br>
What has been described thus far is a system for selecting service providers for a mobile telephone system wherein selection is based upon location and user preferences. As noted, other selection criteria may also be employed. For example, selection may be based, in whole or in part, upon the transmission frequency used, the time of day or date, or other factors. The subscriber unit may store information specifying rate schedules for different service providers and select preferred service providers based upon the current lowest rate. Also, selection may be based upon exclusive factors, rather than on inclusive factors. In this regard, the selection process may select all service providers not otherwise specifically excluded, perhaps as a result of billing issues with respect to specific mobile users. As far as location-based or position-based selection is concerned, the position need not merely be lunited to lat/long. positions on the ground. Selection may be further based upon altitude, velocity or speed. For example, different discrimination factors may be employed to select preferred service providers for subscriber units in airplanes, boats or trains than for hand-held subscriber units carried on foot or in a car. As to velocity, because velocity includes a directional vector, a service provider can be selected that will be able to provide the longest service given the subscriber unit's speed and direction. For example, if the subscriber unit is in an aircraft initially over a geographical area wherein two service providers are available, but moving in a direction where only one of the two will soon be available, the system will select that service provider as the better service provider for that particular mobile communication. In general, principles of the invention may be applied to perform service provider selection based upon any suitable factor. Further, principles may apply to selection of other operating characteristics besides service providers, as well. Also, the principles of the invention are not lunited to satellite-based mobile communications systems but are applicable to other communications systems as well.<br>
Location-Based Parsing of Telephone Numbers<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6-9, embodiments of the invention directed to parsing telephone numbers received from a subscriber unit based upon the location of the subscriber unit will be described. Briefly, the gateway ground station detects a short telephone number string, such as a string<br><br>
without an area code, and interprets the short string as a local telephone number within the locality of the subscriber unit.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates steps performed by the gateway ground station. Initially, at step 402, the ground station receives a telephone call connection request (or any other mobile telephony connection request) from a subscriber unit. The connection request specifies a telephone number that the user of the subscriber unit wishes to contact, perhaps to establish a voice telephone call or a data communication call. The telephone number may be any of a variety of lengths. For example, the telephone number may be a seven digit local U.S. telephone number, a nine digit long distance U.S. telephone number or a longer international telephone number. The telephone number may alternately be of a wide variety of other lengths, particularly if the number being dialed is directed to a telephone number in another country having different standard telephone number lengths. Also, the length of the number may differ if it is a directory assistance number (such as the common U.S. directory assistance number "411'), a telephone repair assistance number (such as the common U.S. repair number "611"), an emergency services number (such as the common U.S. emergency number "911" or the common U.K. emergency number "999'),  or the like.<br>
At step 404, the ground station determines the location of the subscriber unit. This may be accomplished using any suitable technique including the above-described techniques of receiving a fairly precise GPS-based location from the subscriber unit or receiving a somewhat approximate location as determined by tne fleet of satellites. Although shown as occurring following the reception of the telephone number, the determination of the location of the subscriber unit may be made prior to reception of the telephone number or may be contemporaneous therewith. The location may be specified in any suitable maimer including latitude and longitude components or predefined location grid components.<br>
Once the location of the subscriber unit has been determined, the ground station interprets the received telephone number in accordance with the location as follows. At step 406, the ground station parses the telephone number and determines, at step 408, whether it includes an international dialing code. If so, step 410 is performed wherein the telephone number is processed as an international call by, for example, forwarding the call to the appropriate international operator for call completion. In some cases, the user may have unnecessarily entered an international dialing code. For example, the user may be located within the country specified by the international   dialing   code.      If  so,   the   system   simply   removes   the<br><br>
international code from the telephone number and forwards the remaining digits of the telephone number to the local PSTN for call completion. If at step 408, it is determined that the telephone number does not include an international calling code, then step 412 is performed wherein the telephone number is parsed in accordance with the local telephone system parsing rules in the vicinity of where the subscriber tmit is located to determine whether it is a local number, a long distance number or an emergency services number. Hence, if the subscriber unit is located in the U.S., the telephone number is parsed in accordance with U.S. PSTN parsing schemes. If the subscriber unit is in India, for example, the telephone number is parsed in accordance with the India telephone system parsing scheme. Such parsing may be performed in accordance with conventional techniques. Exemplary parsing tables and techniques for the U.S. and India are described in co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/609,924, filed February 29, 1996, entitled 'Telephone Number Parser for Wireless Local Loop Telephones", which is incorporated herein by reference. Many local telephone number systems accom.modate a wide range of telephone number configurations and access codes. Hence, complete parsing may be complicated. However, complete parsing typically need not be performed. Rather, for the method of FIG. 6, it is sufficient simply to determine whether the telephone number is a local number, a long distance number or is an emergency services number.<br>
If, at step 414, the telephone number is determined to be a long distance number (e.g. the telephone number includes an area code or other appropriate long distance identifier), then step 416 is performed wherein the telephone number is processed as a long distance number in the country in which the subscriber unit is located. As before, the user may have unnecessarily entered a long distance area code even though the user is located in the area specified by the code such that the telephone number being dialed is actually a local number. Again, the system merely removes the unnecessary area code and forwards the remaining digits to the local PSTN for call completion. The specific action performed depends upon the configuration of the local PSTN.<br>
If, at step 414, the telephone number does not include an area code, then the ground station determines, at step 418, whether the digits of the telephone number represent an emergency number such as 911 or 999. If so, then at step 420, the groimd station identifies the closest appropriate emergency services center to the location of the subscriber unit and connects<br><br>
the call to that center. If not, then at step 422, the grovmd station process the telephone number as a local call.<br>
As to the emergency services numbers, the ground station maintains a list of all or most emergency services numbers (such as 911 or 999) in use anywhere in the world and compares the received telephone number to the list to identify whether the number corresponds to one of the emergency services numbers. In this manner, the user need not know the appropriate emergency services number in the country or locality in which he or she is currently located. Rather the user may simply use whatever emergency services code he or she is familiar with. Hence, a user from the U.K. may dial 999 in the U.S. and be connected to the local 911 operator. If there is any ambiguity, perhaps because a telephone number used as an emergency services number in one country is used for other purposes in the locality in which the user in located, then the system may further verify that the user wishes to be connected to an emergency services operator before completing the call. In this regard, the system may be configured to send an automatic voice message to the subscriber unit requesting verification.<br>
As noted,, emergency calls are connected to the nearest appropriate emergency services center to the location of the subscriber unit. In this regard, the groimd station maintains a database identifying the locations of emergency services centers and compares the location of the subscriber unit with the database to identify the closest emergency services center. In this manner, the user is not improperly connected with a distant emergency services center. By "appropriate" emergency services center, it is meant that the ground station determines whether the emergency telephone number specifies any particular emergency service and forwards the call to the closest such service. For example, in locations or countries where there are separate emergency numbers for fire, ambulance, police, etc., the ground station connects the call to the closest appropriate center. In localities where a single emergency code is employed (such as 911), the call is merely connected to the nearest emergency operator to the location of the subscriber unit. In the method of FIG. 6, the received telephone number is only examined to determine if it is an emergency services number if it is a local number (i.e. if it has no international code or long distance code.) In other implements, all numbers, including those having area codes or international codes, may be examined to determine if they are emergency services numbers.<br>
Hence, the ground station identifies an emergency services number, even if it is not of the type normally employed in the location of the subscriber unit, and forwards the call to the nearest appropriate emergency<br><br>
services center. As such the user need not know the correct emergency services code for the' country or location that he or she is in, thereby possibly saving considerable time in; an emergency situation. Some mobile telephones or other subscriber units have dedicated emergency call buttons which transmit an appropriate emergency number, such as 911, or other signal. Such a signal is also detected and a telephone connection is made to the nearest appropriate emergency services center.<br>
Also, as described, the system detects whether the number dialed is a local number and, if so, processes the number as a local number in the location in which the subscriber is located, thus freeing the user from the need to dial a long distance or international telephone number to contact a local telephone number.<br>
FIGS. 7-9 illustrate pertinent components of a satellite-based system configured to perform the steps of FIG. 6. The system is similar to that of FIG. 5, with like components identified by like reference numerals beginning with reference numeral 510, and only pertinent differences will be described in detail. FIG. 7 illustrates a ground station 510, an exemplary subscriber unit 512 and an exemplary satellite 514. The subscriber unit includes a subscriber unit location determination unit 524 which receives signals identifying the location of the subscriber unit, a telephone number reception unit 525 which receives a telephone number from the subscriber unit and a parsing unit 526 which parses or otherwise interprets the telephone number based upon the location of the subscriber unit using the method of FIG. 6. To this end, parsing unit 526 accesses a set of parsing tables 522 and an emergency services number and location table 520. Parsing table 520, shown in greater detail in FIG. 8, includes, for each country or other entity having a separate parsing scheme, the range of locations wherein the scheme is employed and information regarding the parsing scheme itself. Parsing unit 526 (FIG. 7), compares the location of the subscriber unit with the ranges of locations in table 522 and outputs the appropriate parsing scheme for use in determining whether the telephone number received is a local number, a long distance number, etc. Table 522 may include, for example, one entry for the United States identifying the geographical boundaries of the U.S. and a set of parsing scheme records specifying that local numbers within the U.S. have seven digits, long distance number have eleven digits, and international numbers are prefaced by 01. A separate entry may be provided for each separate country or location, such as Mexico. Alternatively, for countries sharing the same basic parsing scheme, such as the U.S. and Canada, a single common entry may be provided having a<br><br>
range of locations specifying both countries. The ranges of locations may be specified by a set of latitudes and longitudes or perhaps by a set of grid coordinates.<br>
Hence, the ground station applies the location of the subscriber unit to table 522 to determine the appropriate parsing scheme. As noted, the parsing scheme is employed to determine whether the received telephone number is a local number, a long distance number or an international number. If the location is not within one of the countries listed, such as if the user is on a boat or aircraft, then the system may select the closest likely country or may merely require that the user enter a full international telephone number.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates emergency number table 520 employed to determine whether a received telephone number is an emergency services number. For each emergency services number, such as 911 or 999, the table stores the locations and direct telephone connection numbers (if applicable) of each of the corresponding emergency services centers. The ground station compares the received telephone number with the listed emergency services numbers and, if there is a match, directs the call to the closest appropriate emergency services center to the location of the subscriber unit. Hence, if the user dials 911 in the U.S., the ground station thereby identifies 911 as an emergency access number and identifies the closest 911 emergency operator to the location of the subscriber. The call is then directed to that particular 911 operator. The table additionally lists 999 in connection with U.S. emergency services centers such that, if a user dials 999 in the U.S., that number is also identified as an emergency number and the call is forwarded to the nearest 911 operator. Preferably, all appropriate emergency services numbers used world wide and all appropriate emergency services stations are stored and cross-referenced as need to ensure that the user is connected to the closest appropriate emergency services center, whether it be a fire department, hospital, police department or general emergency operator. As can be appreciated, emergency number table 520 and the various other tables described herein can be configured and cross-referenced in accordance with a wide range of techniques.<br>
Location-Based Coordination of Lawful Intercepts<br>
With reference to FIGS. 10 - 13, embodiments of the invention directed to coordinating lawful interception of telephone calls to or from a subscriber unit based upon  the location  of the  subscriber  unit   will  be<br><br>
described. Briefly, the gateway ground station maintains a list of subscriber units subject to lawful intercept and the jurisdiction in which such an interception is proper, verifies that the subscriber unit is at a location where jurisdiction is proper and, if so, intercepts, records, blocks or otherwise processes the telephone call in accordance with instructions provided by the requesting law enforcement agency.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates steps performed by the gateway ground station in furtherance of lawful intercept processing. Initially, at step 602, the ground station receives a telephone call connection request (or any other mobile telephony connection request) either from a subscriber unit or to a subscriber unit. If the call is to a subscriber unit, it may be from another subscriber unit, a conventional fixed land phone or any other device capable of establishing telephonic contact with the subscriber unit. In any case, the incoming "mobile terminated" call includes signals uniquely identifying the subscriber unit being called—perhaps by its unique telephone number, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or the like. If the call is outgoing (i.e. a "mobile initiated call"), the subscriber unit includes signals, provided along with the telephone number being dialed, that identify itself.<br>
At step 604, the ground station determines whether communications to or from the subscriber unit are subject to a lawful intercept or other similar action. This is achieved, as will be described below, by accessing a database table listing subscriber units subject to such intercepts. Then, at step 606, the ground station determines the location of the subscriber unit. This may be accomplished using any suitable technique. Also, although shown as occurring following the determination of whether the call is subject to interception, the determination of the location of the subscriber unit may be made prior thereto or may be contemporaneous therewith.<br>
Next, at step 608, the ground station compares the location of the subscriber unit with the ranges of locations in which the requesting law enforcement agency has proper jurisdiction and thereby determines whether the telephone call can be lawfully intercepted. If jurisdiction is proper, step 610, then the call is intercepted or any other appropriate action requested by the law enforcement agency is performed, step 612. If jurisdiction is not proper, the intercept is refused, step 614. In either case, the telephone call typically proceeds. Usually, if the call is intercepted, such action is imbeknownst to the parties involved in the call. In other cases, however, the telephone call may simply be blocked. As an example, one party may have a court order to prevent another party from calling him or her, perhaps to prevent stalking or harassment.  Such a court order may apply in<br><br>
one state but not another. Hence if the subscriber unit has moved into another state, blocking may not be legally permissible. As such, the system determines the location of the subscriber unit and performs automatic blocking depending upon its location.<br>
FIGS. 11 - 13 illustrate pertinent components of a satellite-based system configured to perform the steps of FIG. 10. The system is similar to that of FIG, 7, with like components identified by like reference numerals beginning with reference numeral 710, and only pertinent differences will be described in detail. FIG. 11 illustrates a ground station 710, an exemplary subscriber unit 712 and an exemplary satellite 714. The subscriber unit includes a subscriber unit location determination unit 724 which receives signals identifying the location of the subscriber unit and a lawful intercept verification unit 726 which determines whether telephone calls to or from the subscriber unit are subject to lawful intercept and, if so, whether such action is jurisdictionally permissible based upon the location of the subscriber unit, using the method of FIG. 10. To this end, verification unit 726 accesses a lawful intercept requests table 722 and a lawful interception jurisdiction locations table 720. Requests table 722, shown in greater detail in FIG. 12, includes, for each subscriber unit subject to some sort of lawful intercept, the identity of the law enforcement agency requesting the intercept and the type of interception to be performed. Examples of intercepts include recording the telephone call, if it is a voice call, or downloading transmitted data, if it is a data communication. Jurisdiction table 720, shown in greater detail in FIG. 13, stores, for each law enforcement agency, the range of locations of subscriber units where the agency has jurisdiction. The range of locations over which jurisdiction is proper may depend upon the type of intercept being performed. Hence, the jurisdiction table may be further subdivided in accordance with the action to be performed. Moreover, the range of jurisdiction may depend upon the specific subscriber unit, i.e. for a given law enforcement agency, the agency may be authorized to intercept calls from one particular user anywhere in the U.S. but may be authorized to intercept calls from another user only when located in one specific state. Hence, information identifying the jurisdictional lunitations associated with particular subscriber units may additionally be stored as needed either in jurisdiction table 720 or within intercept requests table 724. Information is stored and updated in the jurisdiction and intercept requests databases upon proper request by the law enforcement agencies and is preferably entered by system operators only subject to court orders or other proper documentation,    Such  requirements   differ, however,   from  country   to<br><br>
country. In some countries no such court orders or other documentation may be required. The range of proper jurisdiction is determined based upon the appropriate documentation, if any, provided by the requesting agency and typically no attempt is made to independently verify such jurisdiction.<br>
In any case, verification unit 726 (FIG, 11), determines whether the subscriber unit is subject to a lawful intercept, then compares the location of the subscriber unit with the ranges of locations of permissible jurisdiction in table 724 and thereby determines whether intercept is permissible and, if so, performs such interceptions. The actual interception may be performed in accordance with conventional techniques which will not be further described herein, <br>
Any time lunitations; in the jurisdiction is also recorded in the database tables and the time and date of the telephone call are compared to the lunitations specified in the database to determined, for example, if jurisdiction has lapsed.<br>
Multiple location mapping schemes<br>
With reference to FIGS. 14 - 24, embodiments of the invention directed to providing separate mapping schemes for separate service providers to facilitate, among other things, the tracking of location-based system information will now be described. Initially, general aspects of the mapping schemes are described with references to FIGS. 14 - 17, then details regarding one specific implementation used in connection with a GSM system is described with reference to FIGS. 18 - 24.<br>
Briefly, the gateway system is provided with hardware or software for mapping physical locations within the service area of the gateway into various overlapping sets of virtual cells. FIG. 14 illustrates exemplary sets of virtual cell maps overlaying a portion of the service area 800 of the gateway. A first set of cells 802, referred to herein as a set of information cells, covers or "tiles" the service area with uniformly sized and shaped rectangular cells. Each information cell covers a relatively small portion of the service area. The information cells may be of arbitrary size and shape but are preferably uniformly sized and shaped rectangles for ease of data processing and are each of a relatively small size, such as 10 km by 10 km squares, to allow for adequate location resolution- Each information cell contains pointers to data structures (shown in FIGS. 15A-15C) containing location-based information pertinent to the range of locations covered by the information cells, in the exemplary implementation described herein the location-based<br><br>
information includes, among other items, i) an identification of where the nearest emergency services center is located, ii) an identification of what law enforcement agencies, if any, have jurisdiction to intercept calls to or from a subscriber unit, such as exemplary subscriber unit 804, located within the range of physical locations defined by the information cell, and iii) an identification of what service providers are permitted to process calls to or from such subscriber units. In use, the location of a subscriber unit to which (or from which) a telephonic communication is initiated is determined, perhaps in terms of latitude and longitude, by techniques discussed above. Then the information cell corresponding to the location of the subscriber unit is identified and the location-based information corresponding to that information cell is accessed, as needed. One particular technique for efficiently identifying the information cell based upon latitude and longitude estimates is described below in connection with a GSM implementation.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 14 and 15A - 15D, the system first determines which service providers can permissibly process calls to or from the subscriber unit by accessing a service provider data structure 806 (FIG. 15A) containing, for each information cell, a list of all permissible service providers, then selects one of the permissible service providers, perhaps using the preference-based selection techniques describe above. Circumstances may arise wherein the boundary between service providers occurs within an information cell, rather than between information cells, and such is handled as describe below. If the telephone call initiated by subscriber unit 804 specifies an emergency services number, the system determines the nearest emergency services center to the subscriber unit by examining an emergency services data structure 808 (FIG» 15B) containing, for each information cell, an identification of the nearest emergency services centers, either in terms of its direct telephone number or any other appropriate designator. Depending upon the implementation and the coimtry corresponding to the information cell, the data structure may list, for example, separate direct telephone numbers for hospital, fire, police, ambulance, poison centers, etc. For other implementations or for other countries, the data structure may merely list the appropriate general emergency services number for that country, such as "911" or "999". By first identifying the corresponding information cell then "looking up" the nearest appropriate emergency services center corresponding to that cell, the system need not compare the actual latitude and longitudes of the subscriber unit with those of all the emergency services centers in the service area to<br><br>
determine the nearest emergency services center and therefore routing of the call to the nearest emergency services center is expedited. As will be described below, service provider preferences for handling emergency calls may additionally be stored in connection with virtual service provider cells.<br>
If communications to or from subscriber unit 804 are subject to lawful interception, the system determines whether the particular law enforcement agency has jurisdiction in the area covered by the information cell in which the subscriber unit is found by accessing a jurisdiction data structure 810 (FIG. 15C) specifying all law enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction over that specific information cell area and then proceeds to intercept the call if such is jurisdictionally permissible. Again, the system need not directly compare the latitude and longitude of the subscriber unit with ranges of latitudes and longitudes of jurisdiction and the system czm thereby determine proper jurisdiction more expediently.<br>
The remaining sets of cells illustrated in FIG. 14, i.e. sets 812, 814, 816, 818, and 820, illustrate sets of individual virtual service provider cells, with one set per service provider. As can be seen, the individual sets of service provider cells provide different mapping schemes for mapping portions of service area 800. Set 812, for example, is provided for use in connection with service provider A. Set 812 is aligned with information cell set 802 but differs therefrom in resolution, i.e. each cell of set 812 covers four times the area of each cell of set 802. Set 814 is provided for use with service provider B and has the same resolution as that of information cell set 802 but is slightly offset therefrom. Set 816 is provided for use with service provider C and has a non-uniform arrangement, perhaps corresponding with . a previously defined land-based cellular telephone cell layout. Set 818 is provided for use with service provider D and has the same resolution and alignment as that of information cell set 802 but covers only a portion of the service area. Set 820, which is provided for use with service provider E, also has the same resolution and alignment as that of information cell set 802 but covers only those portions of the service area not covered by set 818.<br>
The different service provider cell mappings are provided, in this exemplary implementation, to acconunodate the requirements or preferences of the different service providers or to otherwise facilitate communication between the service provider and the gateway. In use, once a service provider is selected, the system determines the cell number for the virtual cell of the selected service provider that corresponds to the location of the subscriber unit. This is performed, for example, by comparing the latitude and longitude of the subscriber unit to ranges of locations defining<br><br>
each virtual cell of the service provider or by any other appropriate technique. Once the virtual cell for the selected service provider is determined, the system accesses information pertinent to communicating with service provider or pertinent to processing the call. Such information may include unique cell number identification values for providing location encoding and service provider preferences regarding emergency call handling, call placement, encryption etc.<br>
For example, to facilitate call handling, the service provider may require that the location of the subscriber unit be specified using a predetermined numerical code, rather than latitude and longitude values. A service provider preferences data structure 822 shown in FIG. 15D provides the predetermined virtual cell numerical code, if any, and also provides any preferences or requirements associated with the specific service provider for each virtual cell as defined by the appropriate numerical cell code. (A separate preferences data structure is provided for each separate service provider.) Location information may be required by the service provider, for example, to allow for proper billing of the cost of the call. Hence, if a particular service provider requires or prefers that the location of the subscriber unit be specified in terms of a predetermined cellular telephone cell numbering system (as with service provider C of FIG. 14), such can be readily accommodated and the correct numerical cell designation employed to facilitate routing of the telephone call to the service provider. Thus, in the example of FIG. 14, the system forwards virtual cell number 1455 to service provider C (assuming it has been selected to handle a call initiated by subscriber unit 804) as an identification of the location of the subscriber unit. Even if the service providers themselves have no preferences or requirements as far as cell or location designations are concerned, it is still often expedient for the gateway system to track telephone calls using different virtual cell identification numbers for different service providers. In such a case, each virtual service provider cell mapping may have the same size, alignment and shape, but differ only in numerical cell designators. In the specific GSM implementation described below, the numerical cell designators are related to LAC's.<br>
Continuing, with FIGS. 14 and 15A - 15D, if the telephone number dialed is an emergency services telephone number, the system determines whether the selected service: provider has any particular emergency call routing requirements. For example, the selected service provider may prefer that a general emergency services number, such as 911, be used in some locations  rather than  any direct police or fire number  specified in  the<br><br>
emergency services data structure (FIG. 15B), In other locations covered by the service provider, the service provider may prefer that the specific direct number be employed. This is especially useful if the service provider covers areas within different countries. Other preferences or requirements for lawful interception, call encryption or any other location-based call handling features may be specified in the service provider preferences data structure (FIG. 15D).<br>
FIG. 16 is a flowchart summarizing steps performed by the gateway ground system in connection with the separate mapping schemes discussed above. Initially, at step 902, the system receives a telephone call connection request signal from a subscriber unit specifying, among other items, a telephone number to be connected to. At step 904, the system determines the location of the subscriber unit using the techniques described above. If the subscriber unit is moving, the location may need to be updated periodically, The system, at step 906, then identifies the information cell covering the location of the subscriber unit and then, at step 908, determines the service provider to employ for processing the call, in part, by accessing the service provider data structure (FIG. 15A). Any subscriber preferences may be determined and employed in the manner described above. Next, at step 910, also using techniques described above, the system determines whether the telephone number dialed is an emergency service number and, if so, the system determines the nearest appropriate emergency services center from the emergency services center data structure (FIG. 15B). At step 912, the system determines whether the call is subject to lawful interception and, if so, determines whether the requesting law enforcement agency has jurisdiction to intercept or otherwise monitor the call by accessing the jurisdiction data structure (FIG. 15C).<br>
At step 914, the system identifies the virtual service provider cell corresponding to the information cell of the subscriber unit using the mapping scheme for that particular service provider as set forth in the appropriate service provider preference data structure (FIG. 15D). At step 916, also using the preferences data structure, the system determines any specific location-based call handling preferences or requirements that might apply to the call including preferences or requirements related to emergency call routing, encryption, lawful intercept etc. At step 918, if the call is to an emergency service center,. the system routes the call to the nearest emergency service center using the selected service provider subject to any applicable preferences or requirements. At step 920, if the call is a nonemergency call, the system routes the call using the selected service provider<br><br>
again subject to any applicable preferences or requirements, such as encryption requirements. At step 922, if the call is subject lawful interception and the requesting law enforcement agency was found to have proper jurisdiction over the subscriber unit based on the location of the subscriber unit, the system then begins to intercept the call. The system may additionally or alternatively employ call interception techniques described above in connection with FIGS. 10 - 13.<br>
Thus FIG. 16 summarizes steps performed to utilize the multiple service provider mapping schemes of the invention for a subscriber initiated call. Similar steps may be performed for subscriber terminated calls wherein the subscriber unit receiving the call is in the covered service area.<br>
FIGS. 17 illustrates pertinent components of a satellite-based system configured to perform the steps of FIG. 16. The system is similar to that of FIG. 4, 5, 7 and 11 and only pertinent differences will be described in detail. FIG. 17 illustrates a ground station 1010, an exemplary subscriber unit 1012 and an exemplary satellite 1014. The ground station or gateway subscriber unit includes a subscriber unit location determination unit 1024 which receives signals identifying the location of the subscriber unit, a telephone number reception unit 1025 which receives a telephone number from the subscriber unit and a mapping and control unit 1026 which identifies the information cell that the subscriber unit is located in and controls processing of calls from the subscriber unit using the method of FIG. 16. To this end, information cell mapping unit 1026 accesses a set of data structures 806, 808, 810 and 822, surnmarized above, to determine a service provider for processing the call (assuming it is a subscriber unit initiated call) and to coordinate emergency services call handling, lawful intercept, etc. in the manner described above.<br>
GSM example of multiple location mapping schemes<br>
Referring to FIGS. 18 - 23, a specific exemplary GSM-based gateway system employing multiple location mapping schemes for use with multiple service providers will now be described. The gateway is shared by up to sixteen service providers and covers an area up to 2000 km by 3000 km. The gateway utilizes separate virtual mapping schemes for each different service provider thereby allowing GSM LAC's to be re-used, i.e. the same LAC can define up to sixteen different locations within the service area based upon sixteen different service providers. Each LAC includes cells groups each including a set of virtual cells.  A separate mapping of virtual<br><br>
cells, cell groups, and LAC's  are provided for each service provider. Information cells, of the type described above, are also employed to encode location-based information. The information cells uniformly cover the entire service area of the gateway system and thereby cover one or more service regions. A service region is an area covered by a single set of common service providers.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates the relationship between virtual cells 1100, cell groups 1102 and LACs 1104 for each of a set of different service providers 1106. As can be seen, each mapping of virtual cells, cells groups and LACs can differ from one service provider to another. FIG. 18 also shows a corresponding mapping of information cells 1108, service regions 1110 and service areas 1112 used to encode location information.<br>
All of the virtual cells 1100 of a cell group 1102 are of the same size and shape and are uniformly tiled throughout the cell group. Both the virtual service provider cells and cell groups are rectangular. In one implementation, shown in FIG. 19, all cell groups are of the same size. In a preferred implementation, shown in FIG. 20, the cell groups are of different sizes. Hence, the virtual cells of the different cell groups maybe of different sizes. The implementation of FIG. 20 which provides non-uniform cell groups allows for different population densities to be accommodated to reduce the number of cell groups needed, and thereby reduce overall storage requirements and processing time. In the example showing FIG. 20 which covers France, 453 fewer cell groups are required than using the uniform cell group arrangement of FIG. 19. In either case, some cell groups may overlap.<br>
A collection of cell groups has a single corresponding LAC. The virtual service provider cells are each uniquely represented by a service provider code (SP) and a virtual cell identifier (VCI) code. The VCI code is represented by a LAC and a cell identification code (CelLID). The SP code is represented by a three-digit mobile country code (MCC) and a two-digit mobile network code (MNC). The VCI is provided to individual mobile switching centers (MSC's) for use in performing the location-base processing of the type described above to, for example, identify the nearest emergency service provider. If a particular service provider employs more than one MSC, the LAC is employed to select the appropriate MSC.<br>
FIG. 21 illustrates a single cell group 1102 composed of virtual cells 1100. The location of a virtual cell is specified by a cell number. The cells are numbered as shown beginning with virtual cell "0". Hence the cell number for any particular cells is a function of x-direction and y-direction offsets from a reference point and the width and height of the cells. That is:<br><br>
Cell#;= f(xoff5et, yoffsety width, height).<br>
The CeIIId is based upon the Cell# within the cell Cell Group cell and a base value for the cell Cell Group. An example is provided below for calculating a specific Ce111D.<br>
Preferably the virtual cells are defined to have a small radius of about 0.5 to 1.0 km to ensure sufficient position accuracy within about 10 km. Hence, for a 2000 km by 3000 km Gateway service area, between one million and eight million virtual cells are employed to cover the service area, thereby requiring 22-24 bits to encode and requiring 100 - 300 LAC's.<br>
Information cells, as noted above, are tiled uniformly over the entire service area and likewise each have a radius of 0.5 km to 1.0 km. Each information cell contains information (or includes pointers to data structures) defining the available service providers, public safety answering points (i.e, emergency service centers) for use with IS-41 emergency calls and the nearest lawful intercept centers for use with IS - 41 intercepted calls. If the information cell lies on the border of the service area for a service provider, then the information cell also includes pointers to a data structure defining the shape of the border so that a more accurate determination of whether the subscriber unit is within the service area of the service provider can be made.<br>
The information cells also contains information regarding the enclosing territory, i.e. country, and information regarding a minimum confidence threshold factor, if any, specified by the service provider to be employed in service provider selection. In this regard, the accuracy of the determination of the location of the subscriber unit may vary depending upon various factors such as the latitude of the subscriber unit. Some service providers may wish to process calls only from subscriber units having a fairly precisely defined location to ensure, for example, that the subscriber is actually in the service area of the service provider. In other cases, service providers may be lunited by contract or for other legal reasons, from processing calls from subscriber units outside of their service area and therefore the service provider must have some minimum degree of confidence that the subscriber unit is within the permissible service region. In any case, the information cell specifies a minimum confidence threshold factor for each service provider that can provide service at the given cell and for each information cell. The system compares a position confidence factor received from the satellites as part of the location determination process for<br><br>
a particular subscriber unit and then eliminates the service provider as a candidate for selection if the confidence factor falls below the minimum confidence threshold specified by the information cell.<br>
The various data structures employed by the system, shown at a high level, in FIGS. 15A - 15D, include the following specific records.<br>
An information cell record includes a cell header defining the information cell ID, the information cell center (in terms of lat. and long.) and the type of cell (i.e. border vs. interior). Each information cell also includes a cell body providing pointers to a service region definition record (SRDR) defining the service providers that can permissibly handle calls from that location, pointers to public safety answering point preference records, and lawful intercept center preference records, minimum confidence values for available service providers and border shape information, if applicable.<br>
A service region record includes a service region identifier, a set of pointers to the service provider SRDR's, pointers to a service area definition record for the enclosing territory. A cell group record includes a cell group ID, a pointer to. a LAC record for the enclosing LAC, a reference point position for the cell group, the size of the cell group and the Cell ID base values (one for each enclosing LAC). The LAC record includes a table that maps a cell ID to a cell group (i.e. an inverse mapping) and a pointer to a service area definition record for the service area containing the LAC. The service area definition record includes a service area identifier, a list of adjacent service areas, a list of service providers from other service areas that are allowed to provide service to terminating calls and preferences or requirements regarding minimum confidence. The service provider preference record includes the identity of the service provider, any preferences regarding call placement, handling of emergency calls and options regarding confidence and encryption. The service provider preference record also includes an MSC mapping table for use in determining the MSC based upon the current LAC.<br>
A public safety answering point record includes the identity of the public safety answering point and preferences and requirements for rating the answering points. The answering point with the lowest rating is accessed first. A confidence factor may also be employed for defining whether the rating is to take effect. The answering point record also includes routing information. A lawful intercept center preference record includes the identify of the lawful intercept center and preferences  or<br><br>
requirements regarding ratings and confidence.    Routing  information   is likewise stored.<br>
The various data structures and records are employed generally in the manner described above in connection with FIGS. 14 - 17 to process a telephone call or other communication based upon the subscriber unit position as defined by the information cell and virtual service provider cells. Determination of the information cell and virtual cells is facilitated by employing a mapping table, shown in FIG. 22, which relates locations within the entire gateway service area to the aforementioned service records, information cell records and cell group ID lists. The relationship of the mapping table to information cells and cell groups is shown in FIG. 22.<br>
A subscriber unit location is mapped into the mapping table using latitude and longitude values provided by the satellites. A reference position designates the base of the table. Lat. and long, offsets are calculated between the reference position and the subscriber unit's position. The offsets are employed to index a location in the table. The location in the mapping table is then indexed into the information cells and the service provider virtual cell groups.<br>
The distance between the reference point and the subscriber unit position is approximated by first determining the spacing in distance units for lat. and long, using the current latitude and using a table indexed by the reference point's lat. and containing entries for the distance between lat.,. and long, units at the given lat. Then, lat. and long, differences are determined and finally distance offsets are determined. Hence, the distance between P1 and P2 is determined by calculating an x offset based upon long, difference times long, spacing and by calculating a y offset based upon lat. difference and lat. spacing. This approximation is adequate from distances up to 100 to 150 km. Hence the mapping table entries and references points are sized to ensure that the subscriber unit's position will always be less than about 100 km - 150 km from the nearest reference position. Other distance calculation techniques can alternately be employed.<br>
The position mapping using the mapping table provides an information cell and a set of cell groups. Next, the service region is determined from the information cells. Then, a determination is made as to whether multiple service areas are involved and the service region records are examined if more than one is available. Next, any border conditions, discussed below, are accounted for. Then the VCI is computed using the cell group as follows. For each cell group that contains the position of the subscriber unit, the cell number is computed for the cell group using the<br><br>
position estimate. Then, for each LAC/CelllD pair, the cell number is added to the Cell_ID base to obtain a final CelLID. The LAC value is used as the most significant sixteen bits of the VCI and the final CellJD as the least significant sixteen bits. The computed VCI is then associated with the service provider corresponding to the given LAC. In the example shown in FIG. 21, the cell number is 103. The cell number (103) is added to the CellJD base for each LAC to form a VCL For example, if a LAC table specifies LACl having a LAC value of 0x03FE and a Cell_ID base of 12987 and a LAC2 having a LAC of 0x0023 and a CelUD Base of 908, then:<br>
LAC 1 - final cell ID = 12987 + 103=13090=0x3322; VCI = 0x03FE3322 LAC 2 - final cell ID =    908 + 103=1011 =0x03F3; VCI = 0x002303F3.<br>
The VCI is forwarded to the service provider, which typically corresponds to transmission to a GSM associated with the service provider. The VCI typically corresponds to the "Cell Identifier" in the context of a GSM based system.<br>
employed internally to track the location of the subscriber unit for the purposes of, for example, routing emergency calls etc. The VCI is not forwarded to the selected service provider because of constraints imposed on message types by GSM. Instead the selected service provider receives the LAC.<br>
As noted above, circumstances may arise wherein the border of a service area lies within a single information cell. FIG. 24 illustrates an information cell 1200, the border 1202 of a service provider service area, and a subscriber unit 1204. An identification of whether the service provider can permissibly handle a call to or from subscriber unit 1204 cannot be made solely by identifying the information cell. Such a cell is referred to as a border cell and includes pointers to a data structure defining the shape of the border. The border data structure represents the entire border of the service provider service area in terms of apex points connected by straight lines. The pointer to the border data structure identifies the first border apex point 1206 adjacent to the information cell and identifies the number of remaining apex points within the information cell. Hence, the system can then access all of the apex points within the information cell, reconstruct the shape of the border and determine whether the location of subscriber unit 1204 lies within the service area.<br>
The use of border cell maps has the advantage of providing greater resolution in the determination whether a subscriber unit is within the<br><br>
service area of a particular service provider but, as can be appreciated, requires greater processing time. In some implementations, therefore, border data structures are not employed.<br>
What has been just been described is a specific GSM example of the use of multiple location mapping schemes. As noted above, multiple mapping schemes may be employed in connection with non-GSM system as well.<br>
