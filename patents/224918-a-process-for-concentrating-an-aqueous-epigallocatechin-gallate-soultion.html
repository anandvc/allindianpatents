The present invention relates to a process for concentrating aqueous epigallocate-chin gallate (hereinafter abbreviated to EGCG) solutions.<br>
In particular the invention relates to a process for concentrating aqueous EGCG solutions using selective nanofiltration or reversed osmosis membranes (herein abbreviated to membrane).<br>
US Patent 5,879,733 describes a process for the preparation of green tea extract having improved clarity and color. These extracts are obtained by treating aqueous green tea extract with an amount of a food grade cation exchange resin effective to remove metal cations present in the extract. The extract treated with a cation exchange resin is then contacted with a nanofiltration membrane to remove the higher molecular weight materials such as e.g. pectins, proteins, chlorophyll and oxidation products. The nanofiltration membranes described in US 5,879,733 are made from polymers having a molecular weight cut off from about 700 to about 5000 Daltons (corresponding to pore sizes in the range of from about 17 to about 40 Angstroms). Polymers such as cellulose acetates, polysulfones, polyvinylidenefluorides are used for making these nanofiltration membranes. Especially disclosed is the use of an OSMO SP-12 nanofiltration membrane (made by Osmonics, Inc. of Minnetonka, Minn.) The cellulose acetate polymer from which the membrane is made has a molecular weight cut off of 1000 Daltons (corresponding to a pore size of about 20 Angstroms). By use of the membrane the tea catechins which have a molecular size smaller than the pore diameter of the membrane pass the membrane together with water, while the higher molecular weight materials are rejected by the membrane.<br>
US 5,879,733 does not disclose any membrane which is suitable to concentrate aqueous EGCG solutions. Thus, there is still a need to find a membrane having a high retention rate of EGCG and being able to maintain an acceptable flow rate of the permeate stream.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for concentrating an aqueous epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) solution which process comprises:<br>
a)	feeding an aqueous EGCG solution having a dissolved solids content of about 0.03 wt % to about 10 wt % to at least one membrane module under a pressure of about 5 bar to about 100 bar to provide a permeate purge and a retentate return wherein the concentration of EGCG is increased in the retentate return relative to the concentration in the feed solution and whereby the membrane is characterized by a retention coefficient for EGCG of over 90%;<br>
b)	collecting the permeate purge; and<br>
c)	collecting the retentate return.<br>
The requirements on the membrane used are: a retention coefficient for EGCG over 90%, a permeate flow rate over 5 1/m h, a retention coefficient for the optionally added organic solvent and for any impurities being present of less than 50%.<br>
Membranes are generally characterized in a defined solvent-membrane-system by the retention coefficient R and the permeate flow rate Jy.<br>
With regard to the concentration of an aqueous EGCG solution the retention coefficient R is defined as R = 100 x (1-Cp/Ck) wherein Cp is the concentration of EGCG in the permeate and Ck is the concentration of EGCG in the retentate.<br>
The permeate flow is a function of the osmotic pressure, which is caused by all dissolved molecules (e.g. EGCG and organic solvent) in the concentrate.<br>
The permeate flow Jv is defined as Jy == A x (AP- All), wherein<br>
A is a membrane constant in 1/m h bar,<br>
AP is the transmembrane difference of the pressure,<br>
AII is the transmembrane difference of the osmotic pressure.<br><br>
An example for a suitable membrane is the membrane DESAL-5 which is commercially available from OSMONICS / DESAL, Vista, California. The DESAL-5 membrane permits concentration of EGCG in a range up to 200 fold.<br>
A preferred pressure range for the membrane is from about 10 bar to about 100 bar, more preferably from about 20 bar to about 35 bar.<br>
The process of the invention may be operated at any suitable and desired temperature selected from about 10° C to about 60° C.<br>
The term "aqueous EGCG solution" refers in this context to a solution of EGCG in a mixture of water and optionally an organic solvent. The solvent or the solvent mixture preferably comprises about 70 vol% to about 100 vol%, preferably about 90 vol% of water and about 0 vol% to about 35 vol%, preferably about 10 vol% of an organic solvent. The organic solvent is preferably methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or acetone. The initial concentration of EGCG in the solution is about 0.05 wt% to about to about 10wt%, preferably about 0.05 wt% to about 2 wt%.<br>
Starting material is a green tea extract which can be prepared by methods known in the art e.g. by extracting green tea leaves. Tea extract powders are also commercially available e.g. from Highyin Biological Products Co., Guiyang, China.<br>
EGCG is separated from tea polyphenols present in the extract by chromatography e.g. as described in the European Patent Application 99116032.6 referring to a process for producing EGCG which comprises the steps of<br>
a)	providing a green tea extract;<br>
b)	subjecting the green tea extract to a chromatography on a macroporous polar resin at a temperature in the range of about 30° C to about 80° C;<br>
c)	eluting EGCG from the macroporous polar resin with a polar elution solvent at a temperature in the range of about 30° C to about 80° C and at a pressure in the range of about 0.1 bar to about 50 bar;<br>
d)	optionally concentrating the eluate of step c);<br>
e)	optionally regenerating the macroporous polar resin by desorbing the remaining cate-chins; and<br>
f)	optionally concentrating the desorbed catechins of step e).<br><br>
A possible embodiment of the above chromatography process is described in Example 1.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be set forth in greater detail with reference to Figure 1 showing schematically a single stage membrane nanofiltration device.<br>
The device comprises a feed solution vessel (1) connected to a membrane module (3) by a feed conduit through a high pressure pump (2). Module (3) comprises a spiral wound type or flat sheet type module containing the filtration membrane. The permeate purge conduit Vp is connected to permeate vessel (4). The return conduit Vr is used for recycle of the retentate return to vessel (1). Preferred is a spiral wound module.<br>
In operation, aqueous feed solution containing EGCG is passed to module (3) under a pressure of about 5 to about 100 bar by pump (2). Exiting through Vp is the permeate purge containing water and optionally an organic solvent. Exiting through conduit Vr is the retentate return containing EGCG, which does not pass through the membrane.<br>
For the process depicted in Fig. 1 the retentate return may be sent to the membrane process again, in one or more cycles, in either a batch or a multiple step process (additional concentration of the permeate purge) or as a continuous process.<br>
The following examples explain the invention in more detail.<br>
Example 1 Preparation of the starting material.<br>
A chromatography column was filled with 2.2 kg of Amberlite® XAD-7 resin. 50 g green tea extract from Highyin Biological Products Co., Guiyang, China were dissolved in 50 ml deionized water and the obtained solution was adsorbed onto the top of the column at 60°C and subsequently eluted at 60°C under an argon atmosphere by an eluent flow of 0.11/min. The eluent was a mixture of water/isopropanol (ratio 9:1 by volume). The eluent was degassed and kept under an argon atmosphere prior to use. Three main fractions were obtained containing<br>
a)	10.0 g EGCG in 10.3 1 solution (0,97 g EGCG/1)<br>
b)	5.2 g EGCG in 10.41 solution (0.50 g EGCG/1)<br>
c)	1.3 g EGCG in 5.61 solution (0.23 g EGCG/1).<br>
The amount of EGCG was determined by HPLC analysis. Solvents containing specific amounts of EGCG were used as external standards to quantitatively determine the<br><br>
amount of EGCG by HPLC in the above fractions. The fractions were combined, resulting in a feed solution containing 0.63 g EGCG/1 water/isopropanol 9/1.<br>
Example 2a: Concentrating the EGCG solution in a spiral wound membrane module<br>
Storage vessel (1) was filled with the feed solution of Example 1. The starting volume of feed solution was 61. The rest of the feed solution was added to the membrane module in 21-portions when 2 1 permeate were obtained The solution was passed at ambient temperature through the membrane module (dead volume about 2 1) having a spiral wound membrane element DESAL DL 2540 F containing a DESAL 5 DL membrane. The perme-ate flow rate was initially 12.2 1/m h and at the end 6.81/m h. The pressure across the membrane was kept constant at 31 bar. The membrane surface was 2.5 m . The retentate return was returned to vessel (1). 26.3 1 feed solution containing 0.63 g EGCG/1 were concentrated to 2.06 1. The concentrate was found to have minimum 15.6 g EGCG; minimum yield 95%. No EGCG could be detected by HPLC in the permit purge (the limit of detection was about 0.001 mg/ml). The retention coefficient was therefore about 99.99. The concentration factor was about 13.<br>
Example 2b: Concentrating the EGCG solution in a flat sheet membrane module (optionally)<br>
For practical reasons a flat sheet membrane module with about 0.11 dead volume was used for further concentration of the concentrate obtained in Example 2a.<br>
Storage vessel (1) was filled with the feed solution of Example 2a. The starting volume of feed solution was 0.6 1. The rest of the feed solution was added continuously under nitrogen purge until 14.7 g dissolved EGCG were added. The solution was passed at ambient temperature through the membrane module having a flat sheet membrane element DESAL DL 5, The permeate flow rate was initially 161/m^ h and at the end 3.8 1/m^ h. The pressure across the membrane was kept constant at 43 bar. The membrane surface was 0.0028 m . The retentate return was returned to vessel (1) and concentrated to an end volume of 126 ml. The concentrate was found to have minimum 14.2 g EGCG; minimum yield 97%. Traces of EGCG were detected by HPLC in the permeate purge (the limit of quantification was about 0.01 mg/ml). The retention coefficient was therefore about 99.99. The concentration factor was about 16.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
A feed solution containing 0.98 g EGCG/1 water/isopropanol 9/1 was concentrated in a flat sheet membrane module at 35 bar and ambient temperature as described in Example 2b. The retention coefficient was 99.8.<br>
Example 4:<br>
A feed solution containing 0.98 g EGCG/1 water/isopropanol 9/1 (v/v) was concentrated in a flat sheet membrane module at 35 bar and ambient temperature using the following commercially available membranes. The NITTO membranes are available from Nitto Denko, Japan. The membrane surface was 0.0028 m . The following table shows the results, also including the result of Example 3.<br><br>
The above table clearly shows that the nanofiltration membrane DESAL 5 DL NF achieves an unexpectedly high retention of EGCG, while maintaining an acceptable flow rate of the feed solution to be filtered.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
