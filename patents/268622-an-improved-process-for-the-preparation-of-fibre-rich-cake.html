				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of fibre rich cake . This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of fibre rich cake using fruit industry by product namely apple pomace wherein a formulation is used to get improve texture , moisture and overall quality of the fibre rich cake.<br>
Cake formulation contains high levels of fat and sugar. Each of these imparts different functions and makes the cake, taste better and more palatable. The fat content in the cake helps the cake to be tender, gives moist mouthfeel and lubricate while eating. The concern about the consumption of nutritious food and healthy diet by the consumers is constantly increasing. High fibre bakery products with good retention in specific volume and softness have been prepared. (Silva, R. F., US patents 5035903). Non-starch polysaccharides are the main constituents of cell wall, which is referred to as dietary fibre. Dietary fibre functions as a protective factor against colon cancer. It also reduces the conversion of bile acids into potential carcinogens in the large intestine. (Pomeranz, Wheat chemistry and Technology, pp 99-101).<br>
Fibres act as barriers of diffusion of nutrients by producing viscous digesta in the small intestine, the more prolonged blood glucose response aids in maintaining a normal glucose level. The dietary fibre plays a multiple role in preventing number of health disorders through their influence in the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have been carried wherein apple fibre is characterized by chemical, physical methods. It has been found to be the good source of dietary fibre and superior water binder to wheat and oat bran. (Chen, H., Rubenthaler, G. L, Leung, H. K. and Baranowski, J. D., 1988. Chemical, Physical and baking properties of apple fibre compared with wheat and oat bran. Cereal Chemistry, 65: 244-247)<br>
Many forms of dietary fibre have been added to bread and other cereal-based products. Replacing wheat flour with 4 % of apple fibre decreased the loaf volume of the bread and with further increase in the apple fibre, the loaf volume decreased markedly.<br>
The poor baking quality of certain cereal fibre have been due to several reasons. The main reason is the dilution of gluten proteins. They also inhibit the formation of thin sheets. (Pomeranz, Y., Shogren, M. D., Finney K. F. and Bechtel 1977. Fibre in bread making effects on functional properties. Cereal Chemistry, 54: 25).<br>
Studies have been carried out to see the effect of apple fibre on the physical properties of wheat flour (Chen, H., Rubenthaler, G. L. and Schanus, E. G., 1988. effect of aple fibre and cellulose on the physical properties of wheat flour. Journal of food science, 53: 304-305)<br>
Studies were carried out to develop high fibre muffins with oat bran, rice bran and barley bran fractions. These fibre sources have hypocholesterolaemic and hypoglycaemic properties. These muffins had more moisture, protein and minerals and fewer calories. (Hudson, C. A., Chiu, M. M. and Knucles, B. E., 1992. Development of high fibre muffins with oat bran, rice bran or barley fiber fractions. Cereal Food World, 37(5): 373-376, 378)<br>
Studies have been carried out to utlise apple pomace in the preparation of high fibre cakes and apple pomace was used upto a level of 15%. Whereas apple pomace in the present invention has been tried upto 30% level and the optimized formulation contains 25% of apple pomace which would be contributing more of dietary fibre in the product (Masoodi FA, Sharma B and Chauhan G S, 2002. Use of apple pomace as a source of dietary fiber in cakes. Plant Foods for Human Nutrition57-121-128).<br>
Apple pomace is considered to be rich source of polyphenols, which exert strong antioxidant activity in vitro. (Lu, F. and Foo, L. F., 2000. Antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of polyphenols from apple pomace. Food Chemistry, 68: 81-85). They have investigated that apple pomace as a potential and cheapest source of natural polyphenols for use as dietary or food antioxidant.<br>
Further a new process for the combined recovery of pectin and phenolic compounds have been studied, as these are valuable compounds, which can be used<br>
as functional food ingredients and also as a natural antioxidant (Andreas Schieber, Petra Hilt, Petra Streker, Hans-Ulrich Endre, Christine Rentschler and Reinhold Carle, 2003. Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies, 4(1): 99-107).<br>
Reference may be made to Silva Roy (High fibre bakery products, US 5035903), wherein bakery goods such as bread containing increased levels of dietary fibre was developed by incorporating fibre and fictionalized dairy product so that the specific volume and softness of the product is maintained. The drawback is the development of high fibre bread containing sufficient amounrt of fibre and also functionalised dairy product containing a thickening polymer.<br>
Reference may be made to Caramelli Franco (Process for the production of a dietary food stuff composition in the form of a biscuit having a high food fibre content and reduced calorie content, IT 1276330) wherein dietary foodstuff in the form of a biscuit was developed having high fibre content and reduced calorie content. The drawback is the use of maize flour and glucomannane and vegetable oil in the preparation of high fibre biscuits.<br>
Reference may be made to Jesse Clayor Forkner, Forkner John, H, (Improvements in or relating to the manufacture of fruit containing products, GB 647894) wherein a fruit product for the use in the bakery products is made from tropical nut like coconut, brazil nut, babassu nut, palm kernel etc. Oil content from these are extracted, ground into paste is either extruded or pelleted. The drawback is the use of coconut, raisins, dried apricots, peaches or figs etc.<br>
Reference may be made to Toeller Gudrum, (Process for the manufacture of baked goods promoting health, DE 19631460) wherein baked products such as bread are manufactured from mixture of cereal, such as wheat flour etc and extracts of hemp especially hemp fibre is used during mixing. High content of cellulose and fatty acids promotes health. The drawback is the use of extracts of hemp in the preparation of bread containing high fibre content.<br>
Reference may be made to Miller Van (Yeast leavened baked goods and fruit based shelf life extender composition therefore, CA 221426) wherein a mixture of fruit pectin and fruit fibre was used in the preparation of bread to decrease the staling rate of the product. The product was found to be soft even after 12-14 days of storage. The drawback is the fruit pectin and fruit fibre especially from citrous fruits, apples etc is used to extend the shelf life of east leavened bakery products.<br>
Reference may be made to La Droitle Philippe De Simone Claudio (Bakery products comprising live lyophilized lactic bacteria EP 1010372) wherein the baked product comprises one or more digestible fibre like substances. The drawback is that the fat based composition is essentially water free and comprises live lyophilized lactic bacteria.<br>
Reference may be made to Barndt Richard Lee and Bakal Abraham (Sweet baked goods containing potato flour EP 0586250) wherein baked goods were prepared, which contained potato fibre and high intensity of sweetner like sucrolose. The drawback is the reduced sugar content baked goods were prepared using potato fibre in combination with a sweetener and an emulsifier.<br>
Reference may be made to Wolfslehner Leopold Dipl-ing D (Dietetic food EP 0477161) wherein a dietetic food is described comprising of guar, pectin, apple pomace and/or apple fibre and flavouring substances and sweetener. The drawback of the invention is it is a dietetic food comprising of different ingredients.<br>
Reference may be made to Zheng Jianxian Liang Qiusheng and Yuan Erdong (Sugarless high-fibre low-energy moon cake and its production method CN 1272320) wherein a cake was developed from stuffing material consisting of lotus seed and other ingredients, which possesses the functions of loosening the bowl to relieve constipation etc. The drawback is the cake is consisting of lotus seed and other food fibre.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of fibre rich cake by using combination of additives like Ircithin , sorbitol and whey to improve texture , moisture and overall quality so is to effectively use fruit industry byproduct.<br>

(FLOW CHART Removed)<br>
Novelties<br>
The novelty of present invention is preparation of a gel of apple pomace powder using apple pomace powder, lecithin, refined oil and water so that quality of cake is much better than the cake prepared from powder itself. The formulation used in the preparation of high fibre cakes have a combination of additives like lecithin, sorbitol and whey which together have improving effect on the texture, moistness of the crumb, mouthfeel and overall quality of the fibre rich cake.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
In the present example cakes were prepared using apple pomace in powder form and also in the form of gel. The ingredients used and the quantities used in the following example are given below. In the first experiment the cake was prepared using apple pomace in the form of powder and was blended with wheat flour. The wheat flour-apple pomace blend was creamed with shortening and other chemicals. The cake prepared using apple pomace in the powder form had a volume of 725 cc. The compression force required to compresses 25% was 1.46 kg. Subjective evaluation of cakes showed that the cake prepared using apple pomace in the powder form was crumbly and had slightly dry mouthfeel. Whereas the cake prepared using apple pomace in the form of gel like substance had volume of 775 cc. The texture measurement by using texture analyser shows that the cake prepared using apple pomace gel had softer texture. Sensory evaluation showed that the cake prepared using apple pomace gel like form gave cake, which was better in all respects. The cake was not crumbly and also had moist mouthfeel. This is because the pectin/fibre present in the apple pomace are been hydrated and the particles are swollen up which help in the creaming stage.<br>

In the present example two more ingredients like whey powder and skimmed milk powder at 10% w/w basis were added in the creaming stage to improve the flavour of the cake. The objective and subjective evaluation of the cake are as follows:<br>
Use of whey powder in the formulation helped in the creaming stage. The cream obtained was white and fluffy compared to the cream obtained by using skimmed milk powder. The cake prepared using whey powder had a 840 cc volume, and the compression force was as low as 1.12 kg. The crumb had light brown colour, grain was open and uniform and was highly acceptable. Use of milk powder in the formulation improved the volume marginally and the texture measured using texture analyser showed that the compression force was 1.21 kg when compared to the cake without any additive.<br>
EXAMPLE - 5<br>
In the present example, formulation containing 25% of apple pomace was considered for the preparation of the cake. The ingredients used and the quantities used in the following example are given below. Cakes were prepared as mentioned in the flow chart.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
*0bjective measurement<br>
Combination of additives helped in the improvement of cake quality. In the first experiment, all the three additives namely lecithin, sorbitol and whey powder were used. The cake had a maximum volume of 870 cc and the compression force as measured by the texture analyser showed that the force was 0.99 kg indicating it to be the softest among all. The crumb colour was light brown, grain was uniform and opened, texture was soft and silky and eating quality was excellent. Cakes prepared without lecithin had lesser volume of 800 cc and the compression force was 1.08 kg. The cakes prepared using lecithin in combination with whey had 810 cc volumes and the texture of the cake through objective evaluation was 1.18 kg. The subjective evaluations of the cakes showed that the cakes were slightly dry and the grain was slightly compact. Cakes containing lecithin and sorbitol had volume of 835 cc. The texture of the cake as<br>
measured by texture analyser was 1.11 kg. The subjective evaluation of the cake indicated that the cake did not have wholesome mouthfeel and lacked milk aroma.<br>
Advantages<br>
Fibre rich cakes prepared using apple pomace as a source of dietary fibre and by using different additives has the following properties which are adventitious over the earlier available fibre rich cake:<br>
1.	Formulation of the high fibre cakes contains 25% of apple pomace. Apple<br>
pomace had 51 % total dietary fibre wherein the insoluble fibre is 36.50% and<br>
soluble fibre is 14.6%.<br>
2.	The total dietary fibre of the cake prepared using 25% apple pomace was<br>
14.20%. Insoluble dietary fibre content was 8.4% and soluble fibre was 5.8%.<br>
3.	The total fat content of the cake prepared using 25% apple pomace was 20.5%<br>
when compared to control cakes which fat content in the range of 25 -28%.<br>
4.	The formulation of high fibre cakes thus prepared have a combination of<br>
additives like lecithin, sorbitol and whey such that the cake prepared had an<br>
improving effect on the texture, moistness of the crumb, mouthfeel and overall<br>
quality.<br>
5.	The cake containing more of dietary fibre would be superior to normal cakes.<br>
6.	The fibre rich cake thus prepared from by product of fruit industry did not contain<br>
any added synthetic flavour. The cake was rich in fruit flavour, which increased<br>
the eating quality.<br><br><br>
