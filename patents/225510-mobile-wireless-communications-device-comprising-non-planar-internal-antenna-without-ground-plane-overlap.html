				<td>MOBILE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE COMPRISING<br>
NON-PLANAR INTERNAL ANTENNA WITHOUT GROUND PLANE OVERLAP<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communications devices, and, more<br>
particularly, to mobile wireless communications devices and related methods.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cellular communications systems continue to grow in popularity and have become<br>
an integral part of both personal and business communications. Cellular telephones allow<br>
users to place and receive voice calls most anywhere they travel. Moreover, as cellular<br>
telephone technology has increased, so too has the functionality of cellular devices. For<br>
example, many cellular devices now incorporate personal digital assistant (PDA) features<br>
such as calendars, address books, task lists, etc. Moreover, such multi-function devices<br>
may also allow users to wirelessly send and receive electronic mail (email) messages and<br>
access the Internet via a cellular network and/or a wireless local area network (WLAN),<br>
for example.<br>
Even so, as the functionality of cellular communications devices continues to<br>
increase, so too does the demand for smaller devices which are easier and more convenient<br>
for users to carry. As a result, one style of cellular telephones which has gained wide<br>
popularity is the folding or "flip" phone. Flip phones typically have an upper housing with<br>
a display and speaker, and a lower housing or flap which carries the microphone. The<br>
keypad on such phones may be on either the upper housing or the lower housing,<br>
depending upon the particular model. The lower flap is connected to the upper housing by<br>
a hinge so that when not in use the upper and lower housings can be folded together to be<br>
more compact.<br>
One example of a flip phone is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,337,061 to Pye et al.<br>
The phone has two antennas, a first one of which is mounted on the lower flap and<br>
includes a ground plane and an active monopole fed by a coaxial feed from electronic<br>
circuitry inside the phone. The flap is pivotally connected to the main or upper section of<br>
the housing, and is folded against the main section when not in use. Another similar<br>
antenna is fitted in the main section, and both antennas are connected to transceiver<br>
circuitry in the phone. The antennas are designed to introduce deliberate mismatch to<br>
provide an effective switching system between the antennas without the need for separate<br>
circuit elements.<br>
The antenna configuration of a cellular telephone may also significantly effect the<br>
overall size or footprint of the phone. Cellular telephones typically have antenna structures<br>
that support communications in multiple operating frequency bands. Various types of<br>
antennas for mobile devices are used, such as helix, "inverted F", folded dipole, and<br>
retractable antenna structures, for example. Helix and retractable antennas are typically<br>
deployed outside, i.e., on the exterior of, a mobile device, and inverted F and folded dipole<br>
antennas are typically within (i.e., on the interior of) a mobile device case or housing<br>
adjacent the top thereof.<br>
Generally speaking, internal antennas allow cell phones to have a smaller footprint<br>
than do external antennas. Moreover, they are also are preferred over external antennas for<br>
mechanical and ergonomic reasons. Internal antennas are also protected by the mobile<br>
device housing and therefore tend to be more durable than external antennas. External<br>
antennas may be cumbersome and make the mobile device difficult to use, particularly in<br>
limited-space environments.<br>
Yet, one potential drawback of typical internal cellular phone antennas is that they<br>
are in relatively close proximity to the user's head when the phone is in use. As an antenna<br>
moves closer to a user's body, the amount of radio frequency (RF) energy radiation<br>
absorbed by the body will typically increase. The amount of RF energy absorbed by a<br>
body when using a mobile phone is called the specific absorption rate (SAR), and the<br>
allowable SAR for mobile phones is typically limited by applicable government<br>
regulations to ensure safe user RF energy exposure levels.<br>
One attempt to reduce radiation exposure from cell phone antennas is set forth in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,741,215 to Grant et al. This patent discloses various cellular phones with<br>
internal and external antenna configurations in which the antennas are positioned at the<br>
bottom of the phone to reduce radiation intensity experienced by a user, i.e., by moving<br>
the antenna farther away from the user's brain. Further, in some embodiments the housing<br>
of the phone forms an obtuse angle so that the bottom portion of the housing angles away<br>
from the user's face.<br>
Despite such antenna configurations which allow for reduced radiation exposure,<br>
further advancements in antenna configurations, particularly internal antennas, may be<br>
desirable to allow for further reductions in overall device size while still providing<br>
relatively low SAR values.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a mobile wireless communications device including an antenna<br>
configuration which allows for relatively small device sizes, yet provides desired<br>
performance and relatively low SAR values.<br>
This and other objects, features, and advantages in accordance with the present<br>
invention are provided by a mobile wireless communications device which may include a<br>
housing, a main dielectric substrate carried by the housing, circuitry carried by the main<br>
dielectric substrate, and a ground plane conductor on the main dielectric substrate.<br>
Moreover, the mobile wireless communications device may further include an L-shaped<br>
dielectric extension comprising a vertical portion extending outwardly from the main<br>
dielectric substrate and an overhang portion extending outwardly from the vertical portion<br>
and above an adjacent portion of the main dielectric substrate. Further, a main loop<br>
antenna conductor comprising at least one conductive trace may be relatively positioned<br>
on the overhang portion of the L-shaped dielectric extension so as not to overlap the<br>
ground plane conductor to advantageously provide enhanced antenna performance<br>
characteristics.<br>
More particularly, the main dielectric substrate may have opposing first and second<br>
surfaces, the ground plane conductor may be on the first surface, and the vertical portion<br>
of the L-shaped dielectric extension may extend outwardly from the second surface.<br>
Furthermore, the at least one conductive trace may extend over the vertical portion of the<br>
L-shaped dielectric extension and have a gap therein defining first and second ends of the<br>
main loop antenna conductor. Moreover, the device may further include a first branch<br>
conductor on the main dielectric substrate having a first end connected adjacent the first<br>
end of the main loop antenna conductor and having a second end defining a first feed<br>
point, and a second branch conductor on the main dielectric substrate having a first end<br>
connected adjacent the second end of the main loop antenna conductor and a second end<br>
defining a second feed point. In addition, a tuning branch conductor may be on the main<br>
dielectric substrate and may be connected to the main loop antenna conductor between the<br>
respective first ends of the first and second branches.<br>
The main loop antenna conductor may have at least one tuning feature therein.<br>
Further, the housing may have an upper portion and a lower portion, and an audio output<br>
transducer may be carried by the upper portion of the housing and connected to the<br>
circuitry. The L-shaped dielectric extension may be adjacent the lower portion of the<br>
housing to reduce the SAR associated with the device, for example. Also, the circuitry<br>
may include a wireless transceiver connected to the main loop antenna conductor.<br>
A method aspect of the invention is for making a mobile wireless communications<br>
device and may include forming an L-shaped dielectric extension comprising a vertical<br>
portion and an overhang portion extending outwardly from the vertical portion, with at<br>
least one conductive trace on the overhang portion. The method may further include<br>
connecting the vertical portion of the L-shaped dielectric extension to a main dielectric<br>
substrate so that the vertical portion extends outwardly therefrom, the overhang portion<br>
extends above an adjacent portion of the main dielectric substrate, and the at least one<br>
conductive trace does not overlap a ground plane conductor on the dielectric substrate.<br>
Further, the main dielectric substrate may be mounted in a housing of the mobile wireless<br>
communications device.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are<br>
shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not<br>
be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments<br>
are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey<br>
the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements<br>
throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in alternate<br>
embodiments.<br>
Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, a mobile wireless communications device,<br>
such as a mobile cellular device 20, in accordance with the present invention is first<br>
described. The cellular device 20 illustratively includes a housing 21 having an upper<br>
portion 46 and a lower portion 47, and a main dielectric substrate 67, such as a printed<br>
circuit board (PCB) substrate, for example, carried by the housing. The illustrated housing<br>
21 is a static housing, for example, as opposed to a flip or sliding housing which are used<br>
in many cellular telephones. However, these and other housing configurations may also be<br>
used.<br>
Various circuitry 48 is carried by the dielectric substrate 67, such as a<br>
microprocessor, memory, one or more wireless transceivers (e.g., cellular, WLAN, etc.),<br>
audio and power circuitry, etc., as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, and as<br>
will be discussed further below. A battery (not shown) is also preferably carried by the<br>
housing 21 for supplying power to the circuitry 48.<br>
Furthermore, an audio output transducer 49 (e.g., a speaker) is carried by the upper<br>
portion 46 of the housing 21 and connected to the circuitry 48. One or more user input<br>
interface devices, such as a keypad 23, is also preferably carried by the housing 21 and<br>
connected to the circuitry 48. Other examples of user input interface devices include a<br>
scroll wheel 37 and a back button 36. Of course, it will be appreciated that other user input<br>
interface devices (e.g., a stylus or touch screen interface) may be used in other<br>
embodiments.<br>
The cellular device 20 further illustratively includes an antenna 45 carried within<br>
the lower portion 47 of the housing 21 comprising a pattern of conductive traces on the<br>
dielectric substrate 67, as will be discussed further below. By placing the antenna 45<br>
adjacent the lower portion 47 of the housing 21, this advantageously increases the distance<br>
between the antenna and the user's head when the phone is in use to aid in complying with<br>
applicable SAR requirements.<br>
More particularly, a user will typically hold the upper portion of the housing 21<br>
very close to his head so that the audio output transducer 49 is directly next to his ear. Yet,<br>
the lower portion 47 of the housing 21 where an audio input transducer (i.e., microphone)<br>
is located need not be placed directly next to a user's mouth, and is typically held away<br>
from the user's mouth. That is, holding the audio input transducer close to the user's<br>
mouth may not only be uncomfortable for the user, but it may also distort the user's voice<br>
in some circumstances. In addition, the placement of the antenna 45 adjacent the lower<br>
portion 47 of the housing 21 also advantageously spaces the antenna farther away from the<br>
user's brain.<br>
Another important benefit of placing the antenna 45 adjacent the lower portion 47<br>
of the housing 21 is that this may allow for less impact on antenna performance due -to<br>
blockage by a user's hand. That is, users typically hold cellular phones toward the middle<br>
to upper portion of the phone housing, and are therefore more likely to put their hands<br>
over such an antenna than they are an antenna mounted adjacent the lower portion 47 of<br>
the housing 21. Accordingly, more reliable performance may be achieved from placing the<br>
antenna 45 adjacent the lower portion 47 of the housing 21.<br>
Still another benefit of this configuration is that it provides more room for one or<br>
more auxiliary input/output (I/O) devices 50 to be carried at the upper portion 46 of the<br>
housing. Furthermore, by separating the antenna 45 from the auxiliary I/O device(s) 50,<br>
this may allow for reduced interference therebetween.<br>
Some examples of auxiliary I/O devices 50 include a WLAN (e.g., Bluetooth™,<br>
IEEE 802.11) antenna for providing WLAN communication capabilities, and/or a satellite<br>
positioning system (e.g., GPS, Galileo, etc.) antenna for providing position location<br>
capabilities, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Other examples of auxiliary<br>
I/O devices 50 include a second audio output transducer (e.g., a speaker for speaker phone<br>
operation), and a camera lens for providing digital camera capabilities, an electrical device<br>
connector (e.g., USB, headphone, secure digital (SD) or memory card, etc.).<br>
It should be noted that the term "input/output" as used herein for the auxiliary I/O<br>
device(s) SO means that such devices may have input and/or output capabilities, and they<br>
need not provide both in all embodiments. That is, devices such as camera lenses may only<br>
receive an optical input, for example, while a headphone jack may only provide an audio<br>
output.<br>
The device 20 further illustratively includes a display 22 carried by the housing 21<br>
and connected to the circuitry 48. The back button 36 and scroll wheel 37 are also<br>
connected to the circuitry 48 for allowing a user to navigate menus, text, etc., as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art. The scroll wheel 37 may also be referred to as a<br>
"thumb wheel" or a "track wheel" in some instances. The keypad 23 illustratively includes<br>
a plurality of multi-symbol keys 24 each having indicia of a plurality of respective<br>
symbols thereon. The keypad 23 also illustratively includes an alternate function key 25, a<br>
next key 26, a space key 27, a shift key 28, a return (or enter) key 29, and a<br>
backspace/delete key 30.<br>
The next key 26 is also used to enter a symbol upon first pressing or actuating<br>
the alternate function key 25. Similarly, the space key 27, shift key 28 and backspace key<br>
30 are used to enter a "0" and "#", respectively, upon first actuating the alternate function<br>
key 25. The keypad 23 further illustratively includes a send key 31, an end key 32, and a<br>
convenience (i.e., menu) key 39 for use in placing cellular telephone calls, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Moreover, the symbols on each key 24 are arranged in top and bottom rows. The<br>
symbols in the bottom rows are entered when a user presses a key 24 without first pressing<br>
the alternate function key 25, while the top row symbols are entered by first pressing the<br>
alternate function key. As seen in FIG. 2, the multi-symbol keys 24 are arranged in the<br>
first three rows on the keypad 23 below the send and end keys 31, 32. Furthermore, the<br>
letter symbols on each of the keys 24 are arranged to define a QWERTY layout. That is,<br>
the letters on the keypad 23 are presented in a three-row format, with the letters of each<br>
row being in the same order and relative position as in a standard QWERTY keypad.<br>
Each row of keys (including the fourth row of function keys 25-29) are arranged in<br>
five columns. The multi-symbol keys 24 in the second, third, and fourth columns of the<br>
first, second, and third rows have numeric indicia thereon (i.e., 1 through 9) accessible by<br>
first actuating the alternate function key 25. Coupled with the next, space, and shift keys<br>
26, 27, 28, which respectively enter a  upon first actuating the alternate<br>
function key 25, as noted above, this set of keys defines a standard telephone keypad<br>
layout, as would be found on a traditional touch-tone telephone, as will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Accordingly, the mobile cellular device 20 may advantageously be used not only<br>
as a traditional cellular phone, but it may also be conveniently used for sending and/or<br>
receiving data over a cellular or other network, such as Internet and email data, for<br>
example. Of course, other keypad configurations may also be used in other embodiments.<br>
Multi-tap or predictive entry modes may be used for typing e-mails, etc. as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Exemplary implementations of the antenna 45 are now discussed with reference to<br>
FIGS. 3 through 10. The antenna 45 is preferably a multi-frequency band antenna which<br>
provides enhanced transmission and reception characteristics over multiple operating<br>
frequencies. More particularly, the antenna 45 is designed to provide high gain, desired<br>
impedance matching, and meet applicable SAR requirements over a relatively wide<br>
bandwidth and multiple cellular frequency bands. By way of example, the antenna 45<br>
preferably operates over five bands, namely a 850 MHz Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) band, a 900 MHz GSM band, a DCS band, a PCS band, and a<br>
WCDMA band (i.e., up to about 2100 MHz), although it may be used for other<br>
bands/frequencies as well.<br>
To conserve space, the antenna 45 may advantageously be implemented in three<br>
dimensions, as seen in FIGS. 7 through 10, although it may be implemented in twodimensional<br>
or planar embodiments as well. The antenna 45 illustratively includes a first<br>
section 61 on the PCB 67. A second section 62 wraps around from the PCB 67 onto an Lshaped<br>
dielectric extension or antenna retainer frame 63 which includes a vertical portion<br>
51 extending outwardly from the PCB 67, and an overhang portion 68 extending<br>
outwardly from the vertical portion and above an adjacent portion of the PCB. In some<br>
embodiments, sidewalls 55 may also be positioned on opposing ends of the L-shaped<br>
dielectric extension 63 to provide additional support, if desired (see FIGS. 7 and 9).<br>
The second section 62 of the antenna 45 illustratively includes a main loop antenna<br>
conductor 64 having a gap therein defining first and second ends 52, 53 of the main loop<br>
conductor. The first section 61 of the antenna 45 illustratively includes a first branch<br>
conductor 70, a second branch conductor 71, and a tuning branch conductor 72. More<br>
particularly, the first branch conductor 70 has a first end connected adjacent the first end<br>
52 of the main loop conductor 64, and a second end defining a first feed point, which in<br>
the illustrated example is connected to a signal source 54 (e.g., a wireless transceiver). The<br>
second branch conductor 71 has a first end connected adjacent the second end 53 of the<br>
main loop conductor 64 and a second end defining a second feed point, which in the<br>
illustrated example is connected to a ground plane conductor 69 of the PCB (FIG. 8).<br>
The tuning branch conductor 72 has a first end connected to the main loop<br>
conductor 64 between the respective first ends of the first and second branches. That is,<br>
the first end of the tuning branch conductor 72 is connected to the main loop conductor 64<br>
at some point along the length thereof between the first and second branch conductors 70,<br>
71. The position of the branch 72 between sections 77 and 78 may conveniently be varied<br>
without significant effect on frequency parameters. In the present example, the main loop<br>
conductor 64 has a generally rectangular shape with a first side including segments 75-78<br>
and the gap, an opposing second side 74, and opposing first and second ends 79, 80. The<br>
first and second sections 61, 62 of the antenna 45 may be formed using printed or<br>
patterned conductive circuit traces, as seen in FIGS. 7-10.<br>
While the respective first ends of the first branch conductor 70, the second branch<br>
conductor 71, and the tuning branch conductor 72 are connected to the first side of the<br>
main loop conductor 64 in the illustrated embodiment, other configurations are also<br>
possible. For example, the first end of the tuning branch conductor 72 may be connected to<br>
the second side 74 or either of the first and second ends 79, 80.<br>
As noted above, the second section 62 of the antenna 45 may be positioned on the<br>
vertical portion 51 of the L-shaped dielectric extension 63. This advantageously allows the<br>
overall footprint of the antenna 45 on the top (i.e., circuitry) side of the PCB 67 to be<br>
significantly reduced. Moreover, portions of the main loop conductor 64 may also wrap<br>
around onto the overhang portion 68 of the dielectric extension 63 to provide still further<br>
space savings. It should be noted, however, that the antenna 45 may be implemented in<br>
two dimensions (i.e., where the first and second sections 61, 62 are in the same plane), in<br>
certain embodiments if enough space is available, and that other 3D configurations are<br>
also possible, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The main loop conductor 64 is defined by sections 74-80. The first branch<br>
conductor 70 may be connected to the signal source 54 with or without a passive matching<br>
network, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The second branch conductor 71<br>
is preferably connected to ground without a matching network, and the tuning branch<br>
conductor 72 is floating (i.e., not connected to the signal source 54 or ground).<br>
Generally speaking, the length of branches 70, 71, and 72 are used to set the center<br>
frequency of operation. The square meandering or back-and-forth patterns of the branch<br>
conductors 70 and 72 is a tuning feature which can be used to change electric length,<br>
which varies the center frequency. Moreover, different shapes (i.e., tuning features) of the<br>
branches 70, 71, 72 may also be used to provide different frequencies. For example, in<br>
addition to the meandering and straight-line shapes illustrated in FIG. 3, other geometries<br>
which may be used for these branches include a saw-toothed or triangular meander 40<br>
(FIG. 4A), a branch 41 with a loop (FIG. 4B), etc. Various other shapes and combinations<br>
thereof may also be used to provide different frequency characteristics, as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The section 73 of the main loop conductor 64 may also be used to control<br>
operating frequency. A variety of shapes and/or cut-outs may be used for the section 73.<br>
Such tuning features may include, for example, a "dog bone" 90 (FIG. 5A), a half dog<br>
bone 91 (FIG. 5B), a hairpin 92 (FIG. 5C), a double hairpin 93 (FIG. 5D), a hairpin with a<br>
loop 94 (FIG. 5E), a meander 95 (FIG. 5F), and a sawtooth 96 (FIG. 5G). Moreover, in<br>
some embodiments the entire main loop conductor 64 may take one of fee foregoing<br>
shapes or others, rather than just a section(s) thereof.<br>
If an circuit element is needed in certain embodiments to adjust input impedance<br>
and/or widen bandwidth, a loop type pattern may be used, which creates an additional<br>
resonant tuning stage, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. If adequate space is<br>
available, straight-line portions may be used in the appropriate length. Yet, space is<br>
typically at a premium for internal cellular device antennas, and particularly so for<br>
compact models, and thus one of the above-described shapes (or others) will likely be<br>
preferred.<br>
The width and shape of the section 74 influences antenna gain. The length of<br>
section 74 also impacts the operating frequency. However, it should be noted that the<br>
lengths of the sections 70, 71, 72, and 73 (i.e., the length of the entire antenna 45) also<br>
affects the operating frequency, as is the case with a typical dipole antenna.<br>
The main loop conductor 64 may take a plurality of shapes, widths, and<br>
thicknesses. By way of example, the main loop conductor 64 may also be generally<br>
circular, square, polygonal, etc., although other shapes may also be used such as a U-shape<br>
97 (FIG. 6A), a semi-circle 98 (FIG. 6B), and a kidney bean shape 99 (FIG. 6C).<br>
Moreover, the section 74 may also have notches, patches, etc. Patches may be used<br>
to add surface area so that the section 74 can shape the beam. It should be noted that, in<br>
the case of a cellular telephone, the beam should preferably be directed away from the<br>
telephone, i.e., perpendicular to the plane of the PCB 37. By way of example, the width of<br>
the antenna 45 may be about 7 cm or less, the height of the first section 61 may be about 1<br>
to 3 cm, and the height of the second section 62 may be about 1 to 3 cm depending upon<br>
the given implementation. Of course, other dimensions may also be used.<br>
Regarding the SI 1 impedance characteristics of the antenna 45, to provide wide<br>
bandwidth a good match is needed over the frequency range of interest. Thus, it is<br>
desirable to shrink the SI I circle and then move the shrunken circle to the 50 Ohm center<br>
point, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The area 73, as well as other<br>
portions of the antenna 45, may be used to shrink and/or move the Sll circle, which is<br>
preferably done in a distributed fashion. Further, the matching network and meandering<br>
portions of the antenna 45 may also be used to move the SI 1 circle toward the desired 50<br>
Ohm center point. The center of the shrunken Sll circle is less critical since it can<br>
advantageously be moved toward the 50 Ohm point as noted above in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
General speaking, the above-described antenna 45 allows various shapes and<br>
lengths to be utilized to provide appropriate electrical lengths and current distribution.<br>
Some shapes are simple delay lines, while other shapes are designed to affect current in a<br>
particular area. As noted above, given unlimited space, many of the shapes and geometries<br>
described above may not be necessary. However, it is within the space constrained<br>
environments of mobile wireless communications devices, such as cellular telephones,<br>
where the above-described antenna features are particularly advantageous for providing<br>
desired performance over multiple operating bands.<br>
Various changes in the basic layout of the antenna 45 may be made in certain<br>
embodiments. By way of example, the tuning branch 72 may be moved so that it extends<br>
from section 74 instead of area 73. Other changes are also possible, as will be appreciated<br>
by those skilled in the art.<br>
The PCB 67 has a first surface on which the circuitry 48 is positioned, and a<br>
second, surface on which the ground plane conductor 69 is positioned. Preferably, the<br>
portions of the main loop conductor 64 on the overhang portion 68 of the L-shaped<br>
dielectric extension 63 are relatively positioned so as not to overlap the ground plane<br>
conductor 69. This has been found to provide enhanced antenna performance<br>
characteristics. Similarly, it is also preferable that none of the first, second or tuning<br>
branch conductors 70, 71, 72 overlap the ground plane conductor 69.<br>
A first method aspect of the invention for making a mobile wireless<br>
communications device 20 is now described with reference to FIG. 11. The method begins<br>
(Block 110) with providing a housing 21 having an upper portion 46 and a lower portion<br>
47, a dielectric substrate 67 carried by the housing, circuitry 48 carried by the dielectric<br>
substrate, an audio output transducer 49 carried by the upper portion of the housing and<br>
connected to the circuitry, and a user input interface device (e.g., the keypad 23) carried by<br>
the housing and connected to the circuitry, at Block 111. The method further illustratively<br>
includes positioning at least one auxiliary input/output device 50 within the upper portion<br>
46 of the housing 21 and connected to the circuitry 48, at Block 112, and positioning an<br>
antenna 45 within the lower portion 47 of the housing and comprising a pattern of<br>
conductive traces on the dielectric substrate, at Block 113, thus concluding the illustrated<br>
method (Block 114).<br>
Another method aspect of the invention for making a mobile wireless<br>
communications device 20 is now described with reference to FIG. 12. The method begins<br>
(Block 120) with forming an L-shaped dielectric extension 63 comprising a vertical<br>
portion 51 and an overhang portion 68 extending outwardly from the vertical portion, with<br>
at least one conductive trace on the overhang portion, at Block 121. The method further<br>
illustratively includes connecting the vertical portion 51 of the L-shaped dielectric<br>
extension 63 to a main dielectric substrate 67 so that the vertical portion extends<br>
outwardly therefrom, so that the overhang portion 68 extends above an adjacent portion of<br>
the main dielectric substrate 67, and the at least one conductive trace does not overlap a<br>
ground plane conductor 69 on the dielectric substrate, at Block 122. Further, the main<br>
dielectric substrate 67 may be mounted in a housing 21, at Block 123, thus concluding the<br>
illustrated method (Block 124). Of course, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art<br>
that the order of steps described in the above-noted methods is merely exemplary, and<br>
various steps may be performed in different orders in different embodiments.<br>
Another example of a hand-held mobile wireless communications device 1000 that<br>
may be used in accordance the present invention is further described in the example below<br>
with reference to FIG. 13. The device 1000 illustratively includes a housing 1200, a<br>
keypad 1400 and an output device 1600. The output device shown is a display 1600,<br>
which is preferably a full graphic LCD. Other types of output devices may alternatively be<br>
utilized. A processing device 1800 is contained within the housing 1200 and is coupled<br>
between the keypad 1400 and the display 1600. The processing device 1800 controls the<br>
operation of the display 1600, as well as the overall operation of the mobile device 1000,<br>
in response to actuation of keys on the keypad 1400 by the user.<br>
The housing 1200 may be elongated vertically, or may take on other sizes and<br>
shapes (including clamshell housing structures). The keypad may include a mode selection<br>
key, or other hardware or software for switching between text entry and telephony entry.<br>
In addition to the processing device 1800, other parts of the mobile device 1000 are<br>
shown schematically in FIG. 13. These include a communications subsystem 1001; a .<br>
short-range communications subsystem 1020; the keypad 1400 and the display 1600,<br>
along with other input/output devices 1060, 1080, 1100 and 1120; as well as memory<br>
devices 1160,1180 and various other device subsystems 1201. The mobile device 1000 is<br>
preferably a two-way RF communications device having voice and data communications<br>
capabilities. In addition, the mobile device 1000 preferably has the capability to<br>
communicate with other computer systems via the Internet.<br>
Operating system software executed by the processing device 1800 is preferably<br>
stored in a persistent store, such as the flash memory 1160, but may be stored in other<br>
types of memory devices, such as a read only memory (ROM) or similar storage element.<br>
In addition, system software, specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be<br>
temporarily loaded into a volatile store, such as the random access memory (RAM) 1180.<br>
Communications signals received by the mobile device may also be stored in the RAM<br>
1180.<br>
The processing device 1800, in addition to its operating system functions, enables<br>
execution of software applications 1300A-1300N on the device 1000. A predetermined set<br>
of applications that control basic device operations, such as data and voice<br>
communications 1300A and 1300B, may be installed on the device 1000 during<br>
manufacture. In addition, a personal information manager (PIM) application may be<br>
installed during manufacture. The PIM is preferably capable of organizing and managing<br>
data items, such as e-mail, calendar events, voice mails, appointments, and task items. The<br>
PIM application is also preferably capable of sending and receiving data items via a<br>
wireless network 1401. Preferably, the PIM data items are seamlessly integrated,<br>
synchronized and updated via the wireless network 1401 with the device user's<br>
corresponding data items stored or associated with a host computer system.<br>
Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are<br>
performed through the communications subsystem 1001, and possibly through the shortrange<br>
communications subsystem. The communications subsystem 1001 includes a<br>
receiver 1500, a transmitter 1520, and one or more antennas 1540 and 1560. In addition,<br>
the communications subsystem 1001 also includes a processing module, such as a digital<br>
signal processor (DSP) 1580, and local oscillators (LOs) 1601. The specific design and<br>
implementation of the communications subsystem 1001 is dependent upon the<br>
communications network in which the mobile device 1000 is intended to operate. For<br>
example, a mobile device 1000 may include a communications subsystem 1001 designed<br>
to operate with the Mobitex™, Data TAG™ or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)<br>
mobile data communications networks, and also designed to operate with any of a variety<br>
of voice communications networks, such as AMPS, TDMA, CDMA, PCS, GSM, etc.<br>
Other types of data and voice networks, both separate and integrated, may also be utilized<br>
with the mobile device 1000.<br>
Network access requirements vary depending upon the type of communication<br>
system. For example, in the MobiteX™ and DataTAC™ networks, mobile devices are<br>
registered on the network using a unique personal identification number or PIN associated<br>
with each device. In GPRS networks, however, network access is associated with a<br>
subscriber or user of a device. A GPRS device therefore requires a subscriber identity<br>
module, commonly referred to as a SIM card, in order to operate on a GPRS network.<br>
When required network registration or activation procedures have been completed,<br>
the mobile device 1000 may send and receive communications signals over the<br>
communication network 1401. Signals received from the communications network 1401<br>
by the antenna 1540 are routed to the receiver 1500, which provides for signal<br>
amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., and may also<br>
provide analog to digital conversion. Analog-to-digital conversion of the received signal<br>
allows the DSP 1580 to perform more complex communications functions, such as<br>
demodulation and decoding. In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted to the network<br>
1401 are processed (e.g. modulated and encoded) by the DSP 1580 and are then provided<br>
to the transmitter 1520 for digital to analog conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering,<br>
amplification and transmission to the communication network 1401 (or networks) via the<br>
antenna 1560.<br>
In addition to processing communications signals, the DSP 1580 provides for<br>
control of the receiver 1500 and the transmitter 1520. For example, gains applied to<br>
communications signals in the receiver 1500 and transmitter 1520 may be adaptively<br>
controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP 1580.<br>
In a data communications mode, a received signal, such as a text message or web<br>
page download, is processed by the communications subsystem 1001 and is input to the<br>
processing device 1800. The received signal is then further processed by the processing<br>
device 1800 for an output to the display 1600, or alternatively to some other auxiliary I/O<br>
device 1060. A device user may also compose data items, such as e-mail messages, using<br>
the keypad 1400 and/or some other auxiliary I/O device 1060, such as a touchpad, a rocker<br>
switch, a thumb-wheel, or some other type of input device. The composed data items may<br>
then be transmitted over the communications network 1401 via the communications<br>
subsystem 1001.<br>
In a voice communications mode, overall operation of the device is substantially<br>
similar to the data communications mode, except that received signals are output to a<br>
speaker 1100, and signals for transmission are generated by a microphone 1120.<br>
Alternative voice or audio I/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem,<br>
may also be implemented on the device 1000. In addition, the display 1600 may also be<br>
utilized in voice communications mode, for example to display the identity of a calling<br>
party, the duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.<br>
The short-range communications subsystem enables communication between the<br>
mobile device 1000 and other proximate systems or devices, which need not necessarily<br>
be similar devices. For example, the short-range communications subsystem may include<br>
an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a Bluetooth™<br>
communications module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems<br>
and devices.<br>
