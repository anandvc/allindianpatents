				<td>COMPOUNDS FOR ENZYME INHIBITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to compounds and methods for enzyme inhibition. In particular, the invention relates to therapeutic methods based on enzyme inhibition.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In eukaryotes, protein degradation is predominately mediated through the ubiquitin pathway in which proteins targeted for destruction are ligated to the 76 amino acid polypeptide ubiquitin. Once targeted, ubiquitinated proteins then serve as substrates for the 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic protease, which cleaves proteins into short peptides through the action of its three major proteolytic activities. While having a general function in intracellular protein turnover, proteasome-mediated degradation also plays a key role in many processes such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation, apoptosis, cell division, and NF-icB activation.<br>
The 20S proteasome is a 700 kDa cylindrical-shaped multicatalytic protease complex comprised of 28 subunits organized into four rings that plays important roles in cell growth regulation, major histocompatibility complex class I presentation, apoptosis, antigen processing, NF-KB activation, and transduction of pro-inflammatory signals. In yeast and other eukaryotes, 7 different a subunits form the outer rings and 7 different &amp; subunits comprise the inner rings. The a subunits serve as binding sites for the 19S (PA700) and 1 IS (PA28) regulatory complexes, as well as a physical barrier for the inner proteolytic chamber formed by the two j8 subunit rings. Thus, in vivo, the proteasome is believed to exist as a 26S particle ("the 26S proteaisome"). In vivo experiments have shown that inhibition of the 20S form of the proteasome can be readily correlated to inhibition of 26S proteasome. Cleavage of amino-terminal prosequences of j8 subunits during particle formation expose amino-terminal threonine residues, which serve as the catalytic nucleophiles. The subunits responsible for catalytic activity in proteasome thus possess an amino terminal nucleophiKc residue, and these subunits belong to the family of N-terminal nucleophile (Nta) hydrolases (where the nucleophilic N-terminal residue is, for example, Cys, Ser, Thr, and other nucleophilic moieties). This family includes, for example, penicillin G acylase (PGA),<br><br>
penicillin V acylase (PVA), glutamine PRPP amidotransferase (GAT), and bacterial glycosylasparaginase. In addition to the ubiquitously expressed /3 subunits, higher vertebrates also possess three 7-interferon-inducible j3 subunits (LMP7, LMP2 and MECL1), which replace their normal counterparts, X, Y and Z respectively, thus altering the catalytic activities of the proteasome. Through the use of different peptide substrates, three major proteolytic activities have been defined for the eukaryote 20S proteasome: chymotrypsin-like activity (CT-L), which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues; trypsin-like activity (T-L), which cleaves after basic residues; and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activity (PGPH), which cleaves after acidic residues. Two additional less characterized activities have also been ascribed to the proteasome: BrAAP activity, which cleaves after branched-chain amino acids; and SNAAP activity, which cleaves after small neutral amino acids. The major proteasome proteolytic activities appear to be contributed by different catalytic sites, since inhibitors, point mutations in j3 subunits and the exchange of 7 interferon-inducing j8 subunits alter these activities to various degrees.<br>
There are several examples of small molecules which have been used to inhibit proteasome activity; however, these compounds generally lack the specificity, stability, or potency necessary to explore and exploit the roles of the proteasome at the cellular and molecular level. Therefore, the synthesis of small molecule inbibitor(s) with increased site specificity, improved stability and solubility, and increased potency are needed to allow the exploration of the roles of the proteasome at the cellular and molecular level.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to analogs and prodrugs of classes of molecules known as peptide a',/3'-epoxides and peptide a',/3'-aziridines. The parent molecules are understood to bind efficiently, irreversibly and selectively to N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases, and can specifically inhibit particular activities of enzymes having multiple catalytic activity.<br>
Once thought merely to dispose of denatured and misfolded proteins, the proteasome is now recognized as constituting proteolytic machinery that regulates the levels of diverse intracellular proteins through their degradation in a signal-dependent<br><br>
manner. Hence, there is great interest in identifying reagents that can specifically perturb the activities of the proteasome and other Ntn hydrolases and thereby be used as probes to study the role of these enzymes in biological processes. Analogs and prodrugs for compounds that target the Ntn hydrolases are herein described, synthesized, and investigated. Peptide epoxides and peptide aziridines that can potently, selectively, and irreversibly inhibit particular proteasome activities are disclosed and claimed.<br>
Unlike several other peptide-based inhibitors, the peptide epoxides and peptide aziridines described herein are not expected to substantially inhibit non-proteasomal proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin B, papain, and calpain at concentrations up to 50 jjM. At higher concentrations, inhibition may be observed, but would be expected to be competitive and not irreversible, if the inhibitor merely competes with the substrate. The novel peptide epoxides and peptide aziridines are also expected to inhibit NF-xB activation and to stabilize p53 levels in cell culture. Moreover, these compounds would be expected to have anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, these compounds can be unique molecular probes, which have the versatility to explore Ntn enzyme function in normal biological and pathological processes.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides inhibitor analogs and prodrugs comprising a heteroatom-containing three-membered ring. These inhibitors can inhibit catalytic activity of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase enzymes (for example, the 20S proteasome, or the 26S proteasome) when said inhibitor is present at concentrations below about 50 fM.. Regarding the 20S proteasome, particular hydrolase inhibitors inhibit chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome when the inhibitor is present at concentrations below about 5 /iM, and does not inhibit trypsin-like activity or PGPH activity of the 20S proteasome when present at concentrations below about 5 fiM. The hydrolase inhibitor may be, for example, a peptide a',j8'-epoxy ketone or a',0'-aziridine ketone, and the peptide may be a tetrapeptide. The tetrapeptide may include branched or unbranched side chains such as hydrogen, Chalky!, Ci^hydroxyalkyl, Q. galkoxyalkyl, aryl, Ci^aralkyl, Ci-ealkylamide, Ci^alkylamine, Ci-gcarboxylic acid, Ci. gcarboxyl ester, Ci^alkylthiol, or Ci^alkylthioether, for example isobutyl, 1-naphthyl, phenylmethyl, and 2-phenylethyl. The a'-carbon of the a/',j8'-epoxy ketone or o?,(T-<br><br>
aziridine ketone may be a chiral carbon atom, such as an (R) or |8 configured carbon, as these are defined herein.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions, including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a pharmaceutically effective amount of the hydrolase inhibitor analog or prodrug, which ameliorates the effects of neurodegenerative disease (such as Alzheimer's disease), muscle-wasting diseases, cancer, chronic infectious diseases, fever, muscle disuse, denervation, nerve injury, fasting, and immune-related conditions, among others.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides anti-inflammatory compositions.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides methods for the following: inhibiting or reducing HIV infection in a subject; affecting the level of viral gene expression in a subject; altering the variety of antigenic peptides produced by the proteasome in an organism; determining whether a cellular, developmental, or physiological process or output in an organism is regulated by the proteolytic activity of a particular Ntn hydrolase; treating Alzheimer's disease in a subject; reducing the rate of muscle protein degradation in a cell; reducing the rate of intracellular protein degradation in a cell; reducing the rate of p53 protein degradation in a cell; inhibiting the growth of p53-related cancers in a subject; inhibiting antigen presentation in a cell; suppressing the immune system of a subject; inhibiting kB-a degradation in an organism; reducing the content of NF-KB in a cell, muscle, organ or subject; affecting cyclin-dependent eukaryotic cell cycles; treating proliferative disease in a subject; affecting proteasome-dependent regulation of oncoproteins in a cell; treating cancer growth in a subject; treating p53-related apoptosis in a subject; and screening proteins processed by N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases in a cell. Each of these methods involves administering or contacting an effective amount of a composition comprising the hydrolase inhibitors disclosed herein, to a subject, a cell, a tissue, an organ, or an organism.<br>
Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br><br>
The invention involves compounds useful as enzyme inhibitors. These compounds are generally useful to inhibit enzymes having a nucleophilic group at the N-terminus. For example, activities of enzymes or enzyme subunits having N-terminal amino acids with nucleophiles in their side chains, such as threonine, serine, or cysteine can be successfully inhibited by the enzyme inhibitors described herein. Activities of enzymes or enzyme subunits having non-amino acid nucleophilic groups at their N-termini, such as, for example, protecting groups or carbohydrates, can also be successfully inhibited by the enzyme inhibitors described herein.<br>
While not bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that such N-terminal nucleophiles of Nm form covalent adducts with the epoxide functional group of the enzyme inhibitors described herein. For example, in the /S5/Pre2 subunit of 20S proteasome, the N-terminal threonine is believed to irreversibly form a morpholino or piperazino adduct upon reaction with a peptide epoxide or aziridine such as those described below. Such adduct formation would involve ring-opening cleavage of the epoxide or aziridine.<br>
In embodiments including such groups bonded to a* carbons, the stereochemistry of the a'-carbon (that carbon forming a part of the epoxide or aziridine ring) can be (R) or (S). The invention is based, in part, on the structure-function information disclosed herein, which suggests the following preferred stereochemical relationships. Note that a preferred compound may have a number of stereocenters having the indicated up-down (or (3-a, where 0 as drawn herein is above the plane of the page) or (R)-(S) relationship (that is, it is not required that every stereocenter in the .compound conform to the preferences stated). In some preferred embodiments, the stereochemistry of the a' carbon is (R), that is, the X atom is ft or above the plane of the molecule.<br>
Regarding the stereochemistry, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for determining absolute stereochemistry are followed. These rules are described, for example, hi Organic Chemistry. Fox and Whitesell; Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, MA (1994); Section 5-6, pp 177-178, which section is hereby incorporated by reference. Peptides can have a repeating backbone structure with side chains extending from the backbone units. Generally, each backbone unit has a side chain associated with it,<br><br>
although in seme cases, the side chain is a hydrogen atom. In other embodiments, not every backbone unit has an associated side chain. Peptides useful in peptide epoxides or peptide aziridines have two or more backbone units. In some embodiments useful for inhibiting chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity of the proteasome, between four and eight backbone units are present, and in some preferred embodiments for CT-L inhibition, between four and six backbone units are present.<br>
The side chains extending from the backbone units can include natural aliphatic or aromatic amino acid side chains, such as hydrogen (glycine), methyl (alanine), isopropyl (valine), sec-butyl (isoleucine), isobutyl (leucine), phenylmethyl (phenylalanine), and the side chain constituting the amino acid proline. The side chains can also be other branched or unbranched aliphatic or aromatic groups such as ethyl, //-propyl, n-butyl, f-butyl, and aryl substituted derivatives such as 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, (l-naphthyl)methyl, (2-naphthyl)methyl, l-(l-naphthyl)ethyl, l-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(l-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, and similar compounds. The aryl groups can be further substituted with branched or unbranched Chalky! groups, or substituted alkyl groups, acetyl and the like, or further aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups, such as benzoyl and the like. Heteroaryl groups can also be used as side chain substituents. Heteroaryl groups include nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-containing aryl groups such as thienyl, benzothienyl, naphthothienyl, thianthrenyl, furyl, pyranyl, isobenzofuranyl, chromenyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, indolyl, purinyl, quinolyl, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments, polar or charged residues can be introduced into the peptide epoxides or peptide aziridines. For example, naturally occurring amino acids such as hydroxy-containing (Thr, Tyr, Ser) or sulfur-containing (Met, Cys) can be introduced, as well as non-essential amino acids, for example, taurine, carnitine, citrulline, cystine, ornithine, norleucine and others. Non-naturally occurring side chain substituents with charged or polar moieties can also be included, such as, for example, Ci-ealkyl chains or Ce-naryl groups with one or more hydroxy, short chain alkoxy, sulfide. thio, carboxyl, ester, phospho, amido or amino groups, or such substituents substituted with one or more halogen atoms. In some preferred embodiments, mere is at least one aryl group present in a side chain of the peptide moiety.<br><br>
In some embodiments, the backbone units are amide units [-NH-CHR-C(=O)-], in which R is the side chain. Such a designation does not exclude the naturally occurring amino acid proline, or other non-naturally occurring cyclic secondary amino acids, which will be recognized by those of skill in the art.<br>
In other embodiments, the backbone units are N-alkylated amide units (for example, N-methyl and the like), olefinic analogs (in which one or more amide bonds are replaced by olefinic bonds), tetrazole analogs (in which a tetrazole ring imposes a cis-configuration on the backbone), or combinations of such backbone linkages. In still other embodiments, the amino acid ex-carbon is modified by o-alkyl substitution, for example, aminoisobutyric acid. In some further embodiments, side chains are locally modified, for example, by AE or Az dehydro modification, in which a double bond is present between the a and f) atoms of the side chain, or for example by AE or Az cyclopropyl modification, in which a cyclopropyl group is present between the a and /3 atoms of the side chain. In still further embodiments employing amino acid groups, D-amino acids can be used. Further embodiments can include side chain-to-backbone cyclization, disulfide bond formation, lactam formation, azo linkage, and other modifications discussed in 'Teptides and Mimics, Design of Confonnationally Constrained" by Hruby and Boteju, in "Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive Desk Reference", ed. Robert A. Meyers, VCH Publishers (1995), pp. 658-664, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Selectivity for 2QS proteasome<br>
The enzyme inhibitor analogs and prodrugs disclosed herein are useful in part because they inhibit the action of the 20S proteasome. Additionally, unlike other 20S proteasome inhibitors, the compounds disclosed herein are highly selective toward the 20S proteasome, with inspect to other protease enzymes. That is, the instant compounds show selectivities for the 20S proteasome over other proteases such as cathepsins, calpains, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, tripeptidyl pepsidase II. The selectivities of the enzyme inhibitors for 20S proteasome are such that at concentrations below about 50 /iM, the enzyme inhibitors show inhibition of the catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome, while not showing inhibition of the catalytic activity of other proteases such as cathepsins, calpains, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, tripeptidyl pepsidase II. In preferred embodiments, the enzyme inhibitors show inhibition of the catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome at concentrations below about 10 fjM, while not showing inhibition of the catalytic activity of other proteases at these concentrations. In even more preferred embodiments, the enzyme inhibitors show inhibition of the catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome at concentrations below about 1 (M, while not showing inhibition of the catalytic activity of other proteases at these concentrations. Enzyme kinetic assays are disclosed in U.S. application serial number 09/569748, Example 2 and Stein et al., Biochem. (1996), 35,3899-3908.<br>
Selectivity for Chvmotrvpsin-Like Activity<br>
Particular embodiments of the enzyme inhibiting analog and prodrug compounds described herein are further useful because they can efficiently and selectively inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome, as compared<br><br>
to the trypsin-like, and PGPH activities. The chymotrypsin-like activity of 20S proteasome is characterized by cleavage of peptides in the immediate vicinity of large hydrophobic residues, hi particular, the chymotrypsin-like activity of Ntn hydrolases can be determined by cleavage of a standard substrate. Examples of such substrates are known in the art For example, a leucylleucylvalinyltyrosine derivative can be used. Enzyme kinetic assays are disclosed in U.S. application serial number 09/569748, Example 2 and Stein et al., Biochem. (1996), 35,3899-3908.<br>
Uses of Enzyme Inhibitors<br>
The biological consequences of proteasome inhibition are numerous. At the cellular level, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, cell morphological changes, and apoptosis have been reported upon treatment of cells with various proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibition has also been suggested as a possible antitumor therapeutic strategy. The fact that epoxomicin was initially identified in a screen for antitumor compounds validates the proteasome as an antitumor chemotherapeutic target Accordingly, these compounds are useful for treating cancer. Proteasome inhibition has also been associated with inhibition of NF-*B activation and stabilization of p53 levels. Thus, compounds of the invention may also be used to inhibit NF-/cB activation, and stabilize p53 levels in cell culture. Since NF-*cB is a key regulator of inflammation, it is an attractive target for anti-inflammatory therapeutic intervention. Thus, compounds of the invention may be useful for the treatment of conditions associated with chronic inflammation, including, but not limited to COPD, psoriasis, bronchitis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis.<br>
The disclosed compounds can be used to treat conditions mediated directly by the proteolytic function of the proteasome such as muscle wasting, or mediated indirectly via proteins which are processed by the proteasome such as NF-KB. The proteasome participates in the rapid elimination and post-translational processing of proteins (e.g., enzymes) involved in cellular regulation (e.g., cell cycle, gene transcription, and metabolic pathways), intercellular communication, and the immune response (e.g., antigen presentation). Specific examples discussed below include fj-amyloid protein and regulatory proteins such as cyclins and transcription factor NF-<br>
KB.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the invention is fte use of the compounds disclosed herein for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and conditions, including, but not limited to, stroke, ischemic damage to the nervous system, neural trauma (e.g., percussive brain damage, spinal cord injury, and traumatic damage to the nervous system), multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated neuropathies (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and its variants, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Fisher Syndrome), HIV/AEDs dementia complex, axonomy, diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and viral meningitis, encephalitis, vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontal lobe dementia such as Pick's disease, subcortical dementias (such as Huntington or progressive supranuclear palsy), focal cortical atrophy syndromes (such as primary aphasia), metabolic-toxic dementias (such as chronic hypothyroidism or B12 deficiency), and dementias caused by infections (such as syphilis or chronic meningitis).<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular deposits of p-amyloid protein (p-AP) in senile plaques and cerebral vessels. p-AP is a peptide fragment of 39 to 42 amino acids derived from an amyloid protein precursor (APP). At least three isoforms of APP are known (695, 751, and 770 amino acids). Alternative splicing of mRNA generates the isoforms; normal processing affects a portion of the p-AP sequence, thereby preventing the generation of p-AP. It is believed that abnormal protein processing by the proteasome contributes to the abundance of p-AP in the Alzheimer brain. The APP-processing enzyme in rats contains about ten different subunits (22 kDa-32 kDa). The 25 kDa subunit has an N-terminal sequence of X-GIn-Asn-Pro-Met-X-Thr-Gly-Thr-Ser, which is identical to me p-subunit of human macropain (Kojima, S. et al., Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc., (1992) 304:57-60). The APP-processing enzyme cleaves at the Gln15~Lys16 bond; in the presence of calcium ion, the enzyme also cleaves at the Met-'-Asp1 bond, and the Asp'-Ala2 bonds to release the extracellular domain of p-AP.<br>
One embodiment, therefore, is a method of treating Alzheimer's disease, including administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound (e.g^ pharmaceutical composition) disclosed herein. Such treatment includes reducing the<br><br>
rate of P-AP processing, reducing the rate of P-AP plaque formation, reducing the rate of p-AP generation, and reducing the clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention relate to cachexia and muscle-v/asting diseases. The proteasome degrades many proteins in maturing reticulocytes and growing fibroblasts. In cells deprived of insulin or serum, the rate of proteolysis nearly doubles. Inhibiting the proteasome reduces proteolysis, thereby reducing both muscle protein loss and the nitrogenous load on kidneys or liver. Inhibitors of the invention are useful for treating conditions such as cancer, chronic infectious diseases, fever, muscle disuse (atrophy) and denervation, nerve injury, fasting, renal failure associated with acidosis, diabetes, and hepatic failure. See, e.g., Goldberg, U.S. Patent No. 5,340,736. Embodiments of the invention therefore encompass methods for reducing the rate of muscle protein degradation in a cell; reducing the rate of intracellular protein degradation; reducing the rate of degradation of p53 protein in a cell; and inhibiting the growth of p53-related cancers. Each of these methods includes contacting a cell (in vivo or in vitro, e.g., a muscle in a subject) with an effective amount of a compound (e.g., pharmaceutical composition) disclosed herein.<br>
Another protein processed by the proteasome is NF-xB, a member of the Rel protein family. The Rel family of transcriptional activator proteins can be divided into two groups. The first group requires prcteolytic processing, and includes p50 (NF-KB1,105 kDa) and p52 (NF-/c2,100 kDa). The second group does not require proteolytic processing, and includes p65 (ReLA, Rel (c-Rel), and RelB). Both homo-and heterodimers can be formed by Rel family members; NF-/cB, for example, is a p50-p65 heterodimer. After phosphorylation and ubiquitination of MB and pi 05, the two proteins are degraded and processed, respectively, to produce active NF-xB which translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Ubiquitinated pi05 is also processed by purified proteasomes (Palombella et al., Cell (1994) 78:773-785). Active NF-xB forms a stereospecific enhancer complex with other transcriptional activators and, e.g., HMG I(Y), inducing selective expression of a particular gene.<br>
NF-KB regulates genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response, and mitotic events. For example, NF-/cB is required for the expression of the immunoglobulin light chain K gene, the EL-2 receptor cc-chain gene, the class I major<br><br>
histocompatibility complex gene, and a number of cytokine genes encoding, for example, IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IFN-P (Palombella et al., Cell (1994) 78:773-785). Some embodiments of the invention include methods of affecting the level of expression of IL-2, MHC-I, IL-6, TNFo, IFN-p or any of the other previously-mentioned proteins, each method including administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound disclosed herein. Complexes including p50 are rapid mediators of acute inflammatory and immune responses (Thanos, D. and Maniatis, T., Ce//(1995) 80:529-532).<br>
NF-KB also participates in the expression of the cell adhesion genes that encode E-selectin, P-selectin, ICAM, and VCAM-1 (Collins, T., Lab. Invest. (1993) 68:499-508). One embodiment of the invention is a method for inhibiting cell adhesion (e.g., cell adhesion mediated by E-selectin, P-selectin, ICAM, or VCAM-1), including contacting a cell with (or administering to a subject) an effective amount of a compound (or a pharmaceutical composition) disclosed herein.<br>
NF-KB also binds specifically to the HTV-enhancer/promoter. When compared to the Nef of mac239, the HIV regulatory protein Nef of pbj 14 differs by two amino acids in the region which controls protein kinase binding. It is believed that the protein kinase signals the phosphorylation of kB, triggering DcB degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. After degradation, NF-KB is released into the nucleus, thus enhancing the transcription of HTV (Cohen, J., Science, (1995) 267:960). Two embodiments of the invention are a method for inhibiting or reducing HTV infection in a subject, and a method for decreasing the level of viral gene expression, each method including administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound disclosed herein.<br>
Overproduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines such as TNFa is considered to be central to the processes associated with septic shock. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the first step in the activation of cells by LPS is the binding of LPS to specific membrane receptors. The a- and j8-subunits of the 20S proteasome complex have been identified as LPS-binding proteins, suggesting that the LPS-induced signal transduction may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment or prevention of sepsis (Qureshi, N. et al., J. Immun. (2003) 171:1515-1525). Therefore,<br><br>
in certain embodiments, compounds of the invention may be used for the inhibition of TNFa to prevent and/or treat septic shock.<br>
Intracellular proteolysis generates small peptides for presentation to T-lymphocytes to induce MHC class I-mediated immune responses. The immune system screens for autologous cells that are virally infected or have undergone oncogenic transformation. One embodiment is a method for inhibiting antigen presentation in a cell, including exposing the cell to a compound described herein. A compound of the invention may be used to treat immune-related conditions such as allergy, asthma, organ/tissue rejection (graft-versus-host disease), and auto-immune diseases, including, but not limited to, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease). Thus, a further embodiment is a method for suppressing the immune system of a subject (e.g., inhibiting transplant rejection, allergies, and asthma), including administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound described herein.<br>
Another further embodiment is a method for altering the repertoire of antigenic peptides produced by the proteasome or other Ntn with multicatalytic activity. For example, if the PGPH activity of 20S proteasome is selectively inhibited, a different set of antigenic peptides will be produced by the proteasome and presented in MHC molecules on the surfaces of cells than would be produced and presented either without any enzyme inhibition, or with, for example, selective inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome.<br>
Certain proteasome inhibitors block both degradation and processing of ubiquitinated NF-KB in vitro and in vivo. Proteasome inhibitors also block IxB-a degradation and NF-KB activation (Palombella, et al. Cell (1994) 78:773-785; and Traenckner, et al., EMBOJ. (1994) 13:5433-5441). One embodiment of the invention is a method for inhibiting IicB- a degradation, including contacting the cell with a compound described herein. A further embodiment is a method for reducing the cellular content of NF-KB in a cell, muscle, organ, or subject, including contacting the cell, muscle, organ, or subject with a compound described herein.<br>
Other eukaryotic transcription factors that require proteolytic processing include the general transcription factor TFIIA, herpes simplex virus VP16 accessory<br><br>
protein (host cell factor), virus-inducible IFN regulatory factor 2 protein, and the membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention are methods for affecting cyclin-dependent eukaryotic cell cycles, including exposing a cell (in vitro or in vivo) to a compound disclosed herein. Cyclins are proteins involved in cell cycle control. The proteasome participates in the degradation of cyclins. Examples of cyclins include mitotic cyclins, Gl cyclins, and cyclin B. Degradation of cyclins enables a cell to exit one cell cycle stage (e.g., mitosis) and enter another (e.g., division). It is believed all cyclins are associated with p34.sup.edc2 protein kinase or related kinases. The proteolysis targeting signal is localized to amino acids 42-RAALGNISEN-50 (destruction box). There is evidence that cyclin is converted to a form vulnerable to a ubiquitin ligase or that a cyclin-specific ligase is activated during mitosis (Ciechanover, A., Cell, (1994) 79:13-21). Inhibition of the proteasome inhibits cyclin degradation, and therefore iuliibits cell proliferation, for example, in cyclin-related cancers (Kumatori et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87:7071-7075). One embodiment of the invention is a method for treating a proliferative disease in a subject (e.g., cancer, psoriasis, or restenosis), including administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound disclosed herein. The invention also encompasses a method for treating cyclin-related inflammation in a subject, including adminstering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein.<br>
Additional embodiments are methods for affecting the proteasome-dependent regulation of oncoproteins and methods of treating or inhibiting cancer growth, each method including exposing a cell (in vivo, e.g., in a subject, or in vitro) to a compound disclosed herein. HPV-16 and HPV-18-derived E6 proteins stimulate ATP-and ubiquitin-dependent conjugation and degradation of p53 in crude reticulocyte lysates. The recessive oncogene p53 has been shown to accumulate at the nonpermissive temperature in a cell line with a mutated thermolabile El. Elevated levels of p53 may lead to apoptosis. Examples of proto-oncoproteins degraded by the ubiquitin system include c-Mos, c-Fos, and c-Jun. One embodiment is a method for treating p53-related apoptosis, including administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound disclosed herein.<br><br>
In another embodiment, the disclosed compounds are useful for the treatment of a parasitic infection, such as infections caused by protozoan parasites. The proteasome of these parasites is considered to be involved primarily in cell differentiation and replication activities (Paugam et al., Trends Parasitol. 2003,19(2): 55-59). Furthermore, entamoeba species have been shown to lose encystation capacity when exposed to proteasome inhibitors (Gonzales, et al., Arch. Med. Res. 1997,28, Spec No: 139-140). In certain such embodiments, the disclosed compounds are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in humans caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium sps. (including P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale, which cause malaria), Trypanosoma sps. (including T. cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease, and T. brucei which causes African sleeping sickness), Leishmania sps. (including L. amazonensis, L. donovani, L. infantum, L. mexicana, etc.), Pneumocystis carinii (a protozoan known to cause pneumonia in AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients), Toxoplasma gondii, Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba invadens, and Giardia lamblia. In certain embodiments, the disclosed compounds are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in animals and livestock caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium hermani, Cryptosporidium sps., Echinococcus granulosus, Eimeria tenella, Sarcocystis neurona, and Neurospora crassa. Other compounds useful as proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of parasitic diseases are described in WO 98/10779, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.<br>
In certain embodiments, the disclosed compounds inhibit proteasome activity irreversibly in a parasite. Such irreversible inhibition has been shown to induce shutdown in enzyme activity without recovery in red blood cells and white blood cells. In certain such embodiments, the long half-life of blood cells may provide prolonged protection with regard to therapy against recurring exposures to parasites. In certain embodiments, the long half-life of blood cells may provide prolonged protection with regard to chemoprophylaxis against future infection.<br>
It has also been demonstrated that inhibitors that bind to the 20S proteasome stimulate bone formation in bone organ cultures. Furthermore, when such inhibitors have been administered systemically to mice, certain proteasome inhibitors increased bone volume and bone formation rates over 70% (Garrett, I. R. et al., J. Clm. Invest. (2003) 111: 1771-1782), therefore suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery<br><br>
regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Therefore, the disclosed compounds may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases associated with bone loss, such as osteroporosis.<br>
Bone tissue is an excellent source for factors which have the capacity for stimulating bone cells. Thus, extracts of bovine bone tissue contain not only structural proteins which are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of bone, but also biologically active bone growth factors which can stimulate bone cells to proliferate. Among these latter factors are a recently described family of proteins called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). All of these growih factors have effects on other types of cells, as well as on bone cells, including Hardy, M. H., et al., Trans Genet (1992) 8:55-61 describes evidence that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are differentially expressed in hair follicles during development. Harris, S. E., et al., / Bone Miner Res (1994) 9:855-863 describes the effects of TGF/3 on expression of BMP-2 and other substances in bone cells. BMP-2 expression in mature follicles also occurs during maturation and after the period of cell proliferation (Hardy, et al. (1992, supra). Thus, compounds of the invention may also be useful for hair follicle growth stimulation.<br>
Finally, the disclosed compounds are also useful as diagnostic agents (e.g., hi diagnostic kits or for use in clinical laboratories) for screening for proteins (e.g., enzymes, transcription factors) processed by Ntn hydrolases, including the proteasome. The disclosed compounds are also useful as research reagents for specifically binding the X/MB1 subunit or a-chain and inhibiting the proteolytic activities associated with it. For example, the activity of (and specific inhibitors of) other subunits of the proteasome can be determined.<br>
Most cellular proteins are subject to proteolytic processing during maturation or activation. Enzyme inhibitors disclosed herein can be used to determine whether a cellular, developmental, or physiological process or output is regulated by the proteolytic activity of a particular Ntn hydrolase. One such method includes obtaining an organism, an intact cell preparation, or a cell extract, exposing the organism, cell preparation, or cell extract to a compound disclosed herein; exposing the compound-exposed organism, cell preparation, or cell extract to a signal, and monitoring the<br><br>
process or output. The high selectivity of the compounds disclosed herein permits rapid and accurate elimination or implication of the Ntn (for example, the 20S proteasome) in a given cellular, developmental, or physiological process.<br>
Administration<br>
Compounds prepared as described herein can be administered in various forms, depending on the disorder to be treated and the age, condition, and body weight of the patient, as is well known in the art. For example, where the compounds are to be administered orally, they may be formulated as tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or syrups; or for parenteral administration, they may be formulated as injections (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), drop infusion preparations, or suppositories. For application by the ophthalmic mucous membrane route, they may be formulated as eye drops or eye ointments. These formulations can be prepared by conventional means, and if desired, the active ingredient may be mixed with any conventional additive or excipient, such as a binder, a disintegrating agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a solubilizing agent, a suspension aid, an emulsifying agent, a coating agent, a cyclodextnn, and/or a buffer. Although the dosage will vary depending on the symptoms, age and body weight of the patient, the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated or prevented, the route of administration and the form of the drug, in general, a daily dosage of from 0.01 to 2000 mg of the compound is recommended for an adult human patient, and this may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect.<br>
The precise time of administration and/or amount of the composition that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of treatment in a given patient will depend upon the activity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of a particular compound, physiological condition of the patient (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), route of administration, etc. However, the above guidelines can be used as the basis for fine-tuning the treatment, e.g., determining the optimum time and/or<br><br>
amount of administration, which will require no more than routine experimentation consisting of monitoring the subject and adjusting the dosage and/or timing.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those ligands, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>

made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered inhibitors) moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills, and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes, and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, sohibilizing agents, and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming, and preservative agents.<br><br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active inhibitors) may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more inhibitors) witii oae or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent<br>
Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of an inhibitors) include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches, and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, orpropellants which may be required.<br>
The ointments, pastes, creams, and gels may contain, in addition to inhibitors), excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to an inhibitors), excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.<br>
The inhibitor(s) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation, or solid particles containing the composition. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant)<br><br>
suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound.<br>
Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular composition, but typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, sorbitan esters, lecithin, Cremophors), pharmaceutically acceptable co-solvents such as polyethylene glycol, innocuous proteins like serum albumin, oleic acid, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars, or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an inhibitor(s) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the inhibitors) across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the inhibitors) in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more inhibitors(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene slycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br><br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include tonicity-adjusting agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. For example, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of inhibitors) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.<br>
The preparations of agents may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are, of course, given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, infusion; topically by lotion or ointment; and rectally by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
