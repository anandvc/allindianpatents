THE METHOD"<br>
* * * * *<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a method to assemble<br>
curtain walls for buildings, and a curtain wall assembled<br>
with this method.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Curtain walls for buildings generally comprise a<br>
reticular supporting structure, consisting of uprights and<br>
cross-pieces, on which the covering elements are assembled,<br>
for example glass panels or sheets, or other suitable<br>
material.<br>
The uprights and cross-pieces consist of metal<br>
profiles, generally made of aluminum, with which supporting<br>
means are associated in order to position and attach the<br>
covering elements.<br>
On the visible side of the wall, in order to close the<br>
horizontal and vertical gaps that form between adjacent <br>
sheets, closure profiles or stoppers are generally<br>
assembled. To apply a closure profile of a known type,<br>
however, it is necessary to screw in a relative' first<br>
element, known as presser, to the uprights and cross-<br>
pieces, with a screw about every 20 cm, and then apply in<br>
snap-in manner a second covering element to hide the heads<br>
of the screws and the anti-aesthetic parts of the first<br>
element. This entails both the need for prior holes on the<br>
presser elements and also a double operation during the<br>
assembly step, with a consequent extension of the execution<br>
times.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the condensation that<br>
forms and the water that filters, especially in the cross-<br>
pieces, tends to stagnate between the cross-piece and the<br><br>
closure profile, creating problems connected to<br>
infiltrations of water and humidity inside the wall, and<br>
the consequent formation of mold or otherwise.<br>
Curtain walls, and methods to assemble such curtain<br>
walls, which have the features of, respectively, the<br>
preamble of independent claims 3 and 1, are disclosed in<br>
US-A-5,839,236, US-A-4,672,784 and EP-A-644.311.<br>
One purpose of the present invention is to perfect an<br>
assembly method which allows to assemble rapidly and<br>
without needing prior holes a closure profile onto uprights<br>
and cross-pieces of a curtain wall. Another purpose is to<br>
achieve a curtain wall provided with constraining means<br>
that allow a rapid and simple attachment of the closure<br>
profile with the relative cross-piece and/or upright and,<br>
at the same time, an effective discharge of the filtered<br>
water and the condensation that has formed inside the<br>
elements of the reticule of the curtain wall.<br>
The Applicant has devised, tested and embodied the<br>
present invention in order to overcome the shortcomings of<br>
the state of the art and to obtain these and other purposes<br>
and advantages.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method to assemble a<br>
curtain wall comprising a reticular supporting structure,<br>
provided with uprights and cross-pieces, and covering<br>
elements attached to said supporting structure, said<br>
uprights and said cross-pieces comprising first attachment<br>
means for closure profiles positioned between two adjacent<br>
covering elements and provided with mating second attachment<br>
means, wherein itprovides: a first step of positioning said<br>
closure profiles frontally with respect to said supporting<br>
structure in order to engage said second attachment means<br>
with said first attachment means; a second step of rotating<br>
towards the outside said closure profiles around an axis<br>
passing through the point of engagement between said first<br>
and said second attachment means, compressing first sealing<br>
means associated with a first edge of said closure profile<br>
against the first of said covering element; and a third step<br>
of positioning second sealing means on a second edge of said<br>
closure profile in order to stabilize the positioning<br>
thereof by resting said second sealing means against the<br>
other covering element.<br>
The present invention also provides a curtain wall<br>
comprising a reticular supporting structure, provided with<br>
uprights and cross-pieces, and covering elements attached to<br>
said supporting structure, said curtain wall comprising a<br>
longitudinal element arranged substantially parallel to the<br>
upright or cross-piece and having on at least part of its<br>
inner side a shaping able to couple in snap-in manner with a<br>
mating seating made in the upright or cross-piece, and on at<br><br>
least part of its outer side a first attachment means able<br>
to engage with a mating second attachment means of a closure<br>
profile able to be positioned, in snap-in manner and by<br>
means of rotation, between two adjacent covering elements,<br>
said longitudinal element, in an intermediate position<br>
between said shaping and said first attachment means, having<br>
a longitudinal hollow able to perform a function of<br>
conveying and channeling water and condensation,<br>
characterized in that, in correspondence with the ends of<br>
each of said cross-pieces, it comprises a stopper provided<br>
with at least a drainage hole and a discharge platelet<br>
arranged as an extension of said longitudinal element and<br>
below said drainage hole.<br>
Other features of the invention or variants of the main<br>
embodiment are described hereinafter.<br>
According to the invention, the cross-piece and/or<br>
uprights of the curtain wall include first attachment means<br>
with which second attachment means cooperate, said second<br>
attachment means being provided in the closure profiles in<br>
order to obtain a rapid reciprocal snap-in attachment. The<br>
first attachment means face towards the outer side of the<br>
curtain wall and are arranged in the gap that forms between<br><br>
two adjacent covering sheets.<br>
Here, and in the following description, with the term<br>
"inner" we mean the side of the curtain wall, or of parts<br>
thereof, which faces the bearing structure of the building,<br>
while with the term "outer" we mean the opposite side.<br>
To be more exact, the method to assemble the closure<br>
profiles provides, after having assembled the relative<br>
covering sheet, a first step wherein the closure profile is<br>
coupled frontally with the relative segment of curtain<br>
wall, engaging its second attachment means with the first<br>
attachment means of the relative cross-piece or upright. A<br>
first sealing means, or packing, is associated with a first<br>
edge of the closure profile, and is taken into contact with<br>
a relative covering sheet. Then, the closure profile is<br>
rotated, in a direction from the inside towards the outside<br>
with respect to the curtain' wall, around an axis that<br>
passes substantially through the point of engagement of the<br>
first and second attachment means, exploiting the partial<br>
elastic deformation of the first sealing means that is<br>
pressed against the sheet. Finally, a second sealing means<br>
is positioned in correspondence with the second edge of the<br>
closure profile opposite the first, and rests upon another<br>
covering sheet, thus defining the stable assembly position<br>
of the profile.<br>
In one form of embodiment, the first attachment means<br>
associated with the cross-piece or upright consist of a<br>
strip, or bar, arranged longitudinally parallel to the<br>
relative cross-piece or upright; the strip is provided,<br>
along at least part of its inner edge, with a shaped<br>
profile that is configured to be inserted in snap-in manner<br>
into a mating seating, partly hollow, made on the relative<br>
upright or cross-piece. At least part of the outer edge of<br>
the strip comprises said first attachment means which, in a<br><br>
preferential embodiment, are shaped substantially like a<br>
hook extending outwardly, and are able to cooperate with<br>
said second hook-shaped attachment means provided on the<br>
inner side of the closure profile.<br>
The strip is preferentially made of plastic material<br>
and, apart from its function as an attachment element for<br>
the closure profiles, it also has the function of a thermal<br>
bridge in order to limit the transmission of hot or cold<br>
between the inside and outside of the curtain wall.<br>
According to another characteristic of the present<br>
invention, on the ends of each cross-piece there is a<br>
stopper element on which at least a drainage hole is made,<br>
from which the water that accumulates and/or filters inside<br>
the cross-piece can drain. The cross-piece, in<br>
correspondence with this drainage hole, has a shaped part<br>
along which the inner condensation collects, in order to be<br>
discharged through the drainage hole provided on the,<br>
stopper element and from here through a relative upright.<br>
At least a discharge platelet is also provided,<br>
arranged as an extension of the strip defining the<br>
attachment means for the closure profile and below the<br>
drainage hole; the platelet is shaped so that the water and<br>
condensation that drain both from the strip and also from<br>
the channel of the cross-piece through the drainage hole<br>
are conveyed towards the adjacent upright, which therefore<br>
performs a substantial function as a gutter and downspout,<br>
and through this are discharged downwards.<br>
According to the invention, in an intermediate<br>
position between the outer edge and the inner edge, the<br>
strip defines a longitudinal hollow that functions as a<br>
conveyor and channel for the water and condensation.<br>
The assembly method described above allows a rapid and<br>
simple snap-in assembly of the closure profile with front<br><br>
coupling, in a single operation and without needing<br>
previously made holes. Moreover, the conformation of the<br>
attachment means provided in the uprights and/or cross-<br>
pieces of the curtain wall encourages a rapid outflow of<br>
the filtered water, thus preventing the formation of mold<br>
or infiltrations into the curtain wall itself.<br>

invention will become apparent from the following<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTI0N OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
With reference to fig. 1, a curtain wall 10 consists<br>
of a reticular supporting structure comprising a plurality<br>
of uprights 11, arranged in use substantially vertical, and<br>
a plurality of cross-pieces 12 arranged in use<br>
substantially horizontal.<br>
In the quadrangular spaces defined between the<br><br>
uprights ll and the cross-pieces 12, covering panels, for<br>
example glass sheets 13, are assembled. To be more exact,<br>
as shown in fig. 2a, in correspondence with a relative<br>
cross-piece' 12 every glass sheet 13 has a lower edge<br>
resting on a supporting blade 15, while the upper edge of<br>
the adjacent 'sheet 13 is elastically clamped by a retaining<br>
blade 16. The blades 15 and 16, which normally consist of<br>
aluminum profiles at least partly covered by plastic<br>
material, are assembled opposite each other inside the<br>
front part of each cross-piece 12; they are only shown in<br>
fig. 2a, whereas they have been omitted from the other<br>
figures to facilitate understanding.<br>
On the front side of the curtain wall 10 closure<br>
profiles 17 are assembled, arranged horizontal and vertical<br>
to cover the gaps that form between two adjacent glass<br>
sheets 13.<br>
In this case, each closure profile 17 has a<br>
substantially T-shaped transverse section with the leg of<br>
the T-shape facing towards the inside, and its central leg<br>
ends in a hook 19 facing downwards. The closure profile 17<br>
also has a first edge 25 on which a first packing 26 is<br>
able to be assembled in snap-in manner, and a second edge<br>
27, opposite the first, on which a second packing 29 is<br>
able to be mounted also in snap-in manner. The two packings<br>
26 and 29 are advantageously of the lip type and are<br>
normally kept in contact with the relative glass sheets 13,<br>
so as to prevent water from filtering inside the uprights<br>
11 and/or cross-pieces 12.<br>
On every upright 11 and on every cross-piece 12, for<br>
the whole of their length, a strip 2 0 is assembled on whose<br>
inner edge a shaping 21 is provided for a snap-in<br>
attachment; on the outer edge of the strip 2 0 there is a<br>
hook 22 facing upwards and mating in shape with the hook 19<br><br>
provided on the closure profile 17.<br>
The strip 20, advantageously made of plastic material<br>
or in any case partly elastic, is inserted in snap-in<br>
manner inside a mating housing seating 23, at least partly<br>
hollow and open towards the outside, made in a central zone<br>
of every upright 11 and/or cross-piece 12.<br>
Between the shaping 21 and the hook 22 the strip 2 0<br>
has a longitudinal hollow 3 0 functioning as a channel to<br>
discharge the filtered water and the condensation that has<br>
formed. The longitudinal hollow 30 is located in a<br>
substantially intermediate zone between the blades 15 and<br>
16, and occupies substantially the entire length of the<br>
relative strip 20.<br>
Each upright 11 and each cross-piece 12 also include,<br>
located in a known manner in hollows provided in the<br>
relative front edges, two packings 31 associated with the<br>
inner side of the sheet 13.<br>
At the lateral ends of each cross-piece 12 there are<br>
two stoppers 32 (figs. 2b, 4 and 5), attached by means of<br>
assembly plates 3 3 and including a through drainage hole<br>
35, and a discharge platelet 36 arranged as an extension of<br>
the strip 20 and below the drainage hole 35.<br>
The assembly plates 33 include threaded holes 42 into<br>
which respective grub screws 43 are inserted (figs. 2b and<br>
4) that press against a vertical wall of the relative<br>
cross-piece 12.<br>
The assembly plates 33 also include an attachment<br>
tooth 40 that anchors on a mating tooth-like profile of the<br>
relative upright 11 and that ends frontally in a wedge-<br>
shaped segment 34, arranged outside the respective stopper<br>
32; the segment 34, by inserting a grub screw 41 in a<br>
threaded hole 44 provided in a position adjacent to the<br>
attachment tooth 40, takes the stopper 32 mounted on the<br><br>
cross-piece 12 to press against the upright 11.<br>
The sequence to assemble the cross-pieces 12 to the<br>
uprights 11 provides firstly to insert the stopper 32 at<br>
one end of the cross-piece 12, inserting the plates 33 into<br>
the respective seatings and clamping them in contrast with<br>
the pre-assembled grub screws 43; then, the cross-piece 12<br>
is inserted on the upright 11, attaching the tooth 40 and<br>
completing the coupling by means of pressure tightening the<br>
pre-assembled grub screw 41. In this case too it can be<br>
seen that the assembly of the components of the wall 10<br>
does not require any prior operation to make holes, and is<br>
carried out with extremely simple and rapid operations.<br>
The drainage hole 35 (fig. 5) is located in<br>
correspondence with a collection and discharge channel 37,<br>
defined by a shaping provided in the upper part of the<br>
cross-piece 12 on which the stopper 32 is assembled.<br>
The platelet 3 6 has a raised edge 39 and has its base<br>
surface horizontal or, according to a variant, slightly<br>
inclined towards the inside, so as to convey inside a<br>
relative upright 11 both the water that flows on the base<br>
surface of the strip 20, and also that which collects in<br>
the channel 37 and which drains through the hole 3 5 of the<br>
stopper 32.<br>
With this solution, the water and condensation do not<br>
stagnate inside the cross-pieces 12 but are quickly and<br>
constantly discharged.<br>
Figs. 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d show the sequence of assembly<br>
of a closure profile 17 with respect to a respective<br>
upright 11 and/or cross-piece 12, subsequent to the<br>
positioning of the relative sheets 13.<br>
The figures describe the assembly with respect to a<br>
cross-piece 12, but the assembly of the profile on an<br>
upright 11 is substantially identical, wherein the meaning<br><br>
of the terms "up" or "down" and derivatives thereof must be<br>
read as "right" or "left" and derivatives thereof.<br>
Firstly, after having positioned the relative upper<br>
sheet 13 resting it on the blade 15 (see fig. 2a) , the<br>
closure profile 17 is inserted frontally, slightly inclined<br>
downwards with respect to the cross-piece 12, with the hook<br>
19 arranged in this case above the hook 22 of the strip 20,<br>
and with the upper packing 26 assembled on a first upper<br>
edge 25 in contact with the respective upper glass sheet 13<br>
(fig. 3a).<br>
In the following step (fig. 3b) , the hook 19 of the<br>
closure profile 17 is engaged with the hook 22 of the strip<br>
20, and the closure profile 17 is rotated from the inside<br>
to the outside, pivoting on the hook 19. The rotation is<br>
allowed by the elastic deformation of the upper packing 2 6<br>
when pressed against the relative sheet 13. At the end of<br>
this operation (fig. 3c) , a second lower packing 29 is<br>
inserted on the second lower edge 27 of the profile 17, in<br>
such a manner (fig. 3d) as to stabilize the position of the<br>
profile 17 with both packings 26 and 29 pressed against the<br>
respective glass sheets 13. <br>
It is therefore simple and quick to assemble the<br>
profile 17, it requires only a single operation and does<br>
not need any previously made holes.<br>
If water should filter through the packings 26, 29 and<br>
31, or if condensation should form inside the cross-piece<br>
12, this is discharged flowing through the channel 37, the<br>
hole 35, the platelet 36 and/or the hollow 30, and is then<br>
conveyed inside the relative upright 11; this considerably<br>
reduces the risk of mold forming inside the curtain wall<br>
10.<br>
It is clear, however, that modifications and/or<br>
additions of parts or steps may be made to the curtain wall<br><br>
10 and the assembly method as described heretofore, without<br>
departing from the field and scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For example, the two hooks 19 and 22 can be replaced<br>
by other equivalent snap-in attachment systems. The<br>
clamping of the strip 20 to the relative upright 11 or<br>
cross-piece 12 can also be achieved with equivalent means<br>
to those shown here. The grub screws 41 and 43 could be<br>
replaced by pins, blocks or other identical or equivalent<br>
clamping means.<br>
Although a solution is shown here wherein there are<br>
two assembly plates 33 of the stoppers 32, it is clear that<br>
a single plate 33 could be provided.<br>
It is also clear that, although the present invention<br>
has been described with reference to specific examples, a<br>
person of skill in the art shall certainly be able to<br>
achieve many other equivalent forms of curtain wall and its<br>
assembly method, all of which shall come within the field<br>
and scope of the present invention.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD TO ASSEMBLE CURTAIN WALLS AND CURTAIN WALL<br>
ADOPTING THE METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to a method to assemble a curtain wall<br>
comprising a reticular supporting structure, provided with uprights and cross-<br>
pieces (12), and covering elements (13) attached to said supporting structure,<br>
said uprights and said cross-pieces (12) comprising first attachment means (22)<br>
for closure profiles (17) positioned between two adjacent covering elements (13)<br>
and provided with mating second attachment means (19), wherein it provides: a<br>
first step of positioning said closure profiles (17) frontally with respect to said<br>
supporting structure in order to engage said second attachment means (19) with<br>
said first attachment means (22); a second step of rotating towards the outside<br>
said closure profiles (17) around an axis passing through the point of<br>
engagement between said first (22) and said second (19) attachment means,<br>
compressing first sealing means (26) associated with a first edge (25) of said<br>
closure profile (17) against the first of said covering element (13); and a third step<br>
of positioning second sealing means (29) on a second edge (27) of said closure<br>
profile (17) in order to stabilize the positioning thereof by resting said second<br>
sealing means (29) against the other covering element (13). A curtain wall<br>
adopting the above method is also disclosed.</td>
