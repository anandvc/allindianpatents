				<td>Description<br>
Power supply device for a submersible vessel<br>
The invention relates to a power supply for a submarine having<br>
at least one electrical propeller motor, one battery set, one<br>
charging generator with a drive and one power supply system<br>
with busbars as well as switching and automation devices, with<br>
the power supply device having an H2O2 fuel cell device.<br>
Power supply devices for submarines having the equipment<br>
mentioned above are known, and the object of the invention is<br>
to refine the known power supply device in such a manner that,<br>
with the same design in principle, it can not only be designed<br>
in new submarines but is also suitable, in particular, for<br>
retrofitting older submarines with snorkels, for example,<br>
Type 209. The older submarines with snorkels are intended to<br>
achieve a longer underwater range by being retrofitted in this<br>
way, as was already proposed some time ago, see the Siemens AG<br>
document "Electrical Systems for Submarines" dated 2001. In<br>
this case, it should be remembered that the electrical power<br>
which is installed on board the retrofitted submarines is<br>
considerably greater than the original installed electrical<br>
power, particularly when the battery sets are also replaced<br>
virtually at the same time as the retrofitting with a fuel cell<br>
device. The new batteries generally have a considerably higher<br>
performance than the originally installed batteries.<br>
Overall, the electrical system must be refined according to the<br>
object such that it is suitable for feeding more electrical<br>
power to the submarine propulsion system, and is suitable for<br>
the fuel-cell-specific characteristics. In this case, it should<br>
be borne in mind that the retrofitting with a fuel cell device,<br>
as mentioned in the cited document is<br><br>
carried out in such a way that the hull of the older submarine<br>
has a so-called AIP (Air Independent Propulsion) disk added to<br>
it. This contains the fuel cell device and the control and<br>
switching devices associated with it, as well as the necessary<br>
auxiliary devices, etc.<br>
The object is essentially achieved in that the fuel cell device<br>
is connected to the busbars for supplying electrical power to<br>
the propeller motor via a circuit breaker which is operated as<br>
a function of the voltage level of the fuel cell device.<br>
The simplest solution for retrofitting or else for the initial<br>
equipment of a submarine with a fuel cell device would be for<br>
this to be connected directly to the busbars for supplying<br>
electrical power to the propeller motor, since the fuel cell<br>
device can intrinsically be switched on and off and thus could<br>
be connected directly to the busbars for supplying electrical<br>
power to the propeller motor. This would satisfy the<br>
requirements for connection of the fuel cell device to the<br>
power supply system in a submarine in a particularly space-<br>
saving and simple manner. However, according to the invention,<br>
a circuit breaker is arranged between the fuel cell device and<br>
the busbars which are connected to the propeller motor and can<br>
be operated as a function of the voltage level of the fuel cell<br>
device. This allows the fuel cell device to be connected in a<br>
particularly advantageous manner, which allows the fuel cells<br>
to be switched on and to be tested, etc. particularly well. It<br>
is thus possible to meet the particular operating requirements<br>
of a fuel cell device for submarines.<br>
A refinement of the invention provides that the power supply<br>
device has a circuit breaker in the form of a two-pole circuit<br>
breaker for at least 1000 amperes. This results in an<br>
advantageously cost-<br><br>
effective, simple circuit breaker which ensures the necessary<br>
operational safety and reliability for a fuel cell device on<br>
board submarines.<br>
Another refinement of the invention provides that the circuit<br>
breaker is a three-pole circuit breaker designed for low stray<br>
fields, with the circuit breaker connecting the fuel cell<br>
device directly to the busbars of the power supply device in<br>
both cases. A three-pole circuit breaker is already<br>
considerably more complex than a two-pole circuit breaker but<br>
has the particular advantage that its design allows power to be<br>
transmitted with low stray fields. This embodiment thus results<br>
in a particularly advantageous power supply for the submarine<br>
via the fuel cell installation taking account of the stringent<br>
requirements for protection against detection.<br>
A refinement of the invention also provides that a DC/DC<br>
controller can also be arranged between the fuel cell device<br>
and the circuit breaker, if required. The arrangement of a<br>
DC/DC controller between the fuel cell device and the circuit<br>
breaker allows the fuel cell to be operated in a particularly<br>
advantageous voltage range, without the voltage level of the<br>
busbars having to correspond to this. This thus results in<br>
particularly advantageous availability for operation of the<br>
fuel cell device. The fuel cell can thus also be connected to<br>
the busbars during partial load operation. In addition, the<br>
voltage level for the power transmitted to the busbars can be<br>
maintained in the event of a failure of more than one module,<br>
when the fuel cell device comprises a plurality of modules, for<br>
example, eight modules, which are connected in series.<br>
One refinement of the invention also provides that the fuel<br>
cell device is operated with an on and off switching mode. The<br>
fuel cell device may thus<br><br>
in each case be started up and shut down optimally particularly<br>
when the circuit breaker, as is advantageously provided, is<br>
operated as a function of a fuel-cell-device-specific on and<br>
off switching mode. This considerably improves the operational<br>
reliability and safety and life, as well as the number of on<br>
and off switching processes, which the fuel cell device can<br>
carry out. The fuel cell modules are provided with a range of<br>
automation components both for operation and for test purposes,<br>
for example, sensors, pumps, and remotely-operated valves for<br>
hydrogen, oxygen, cooling water, nitrogen, vacuum and<br>
demineralized water.<br>
In addition, further operating components are included for<br>
operation and switching of the fuel cell modules, such as<br>
pressure reducers, heat exchangers, gas tanks, etc. to be<br>
precise in this case, as well as both for operation and for<br>
test purposes. This results in a fuel cell device which can be<br>
operated and tested completely "on the rig" in which case the<br>
on and off switching modes can likewise be tested. Overall,<br>
this therefore results in a fuel cell device which can be used<br>
as a "stand alone" device in the same way as the battery sets<br>
and can be connected as required to the busbars in order to<br>
supply electrical power to the electrical propeller motor.<br>
It is self-evident that the fuel cell device must be protected<br>
against damage resulting from short circuits in the vessel<br>
power supply system in the same way, for example, as battery<br>
sets. Provision is made for this purpose for a fuse link to be<br>
arranged in the parallel path of the fuel cell device and of<br>
the normal charging connection and to be connected in series<br>
with the circuit breakers. This ensures particular protection<br>
for the fuel cell installation which, in fact, represents a<br>
very high value. The value is not only due to the fact that the<br>
fuel cell device provides the submarine with a long submersion<br>
time and allows it to travel for a long distance under water<br>
but from the fact that<br><br>
the very high costs for repair or possibly even new production<br>
can actually also be avoided.<br>
The idea of equipping boats with fuel cells has already been in<br>
existence for a long time. This idea came about when the first<br>
spacecraft were equipped with fuel cells which, at that time,<br>
were still carbonate cells. However, since the power supply<br>
devices for submarines differ very considerably from the power<br>
supply devices for spacecraft, the idea was not implemented for<br>
a long time, despite extensive tests. The idea can be<br>
implemented particularly safely and reliably by means of the<br>
invention. This applies not only to new-built submarines, but<br>
also to the retrofitting of submarines, where it is of<br>
particular financial importance.<br>
Voltage dips necessarily occur in the main system, and can lead<br>
to operating disturbances when short circuits are disconnected<br>
by means of circuit breakers, or by circuit breakers in<br>
conjunction with fuse links when the short-circuit currents are<br>
very high. The disturbing voltage dips can be virtually avoided<br>
by the use of an HTS current limiter. Rapid current limiting<br>
likewise results in considerably reduced mechanical and thermal<br>
loads on the switchgear.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, it is particularly<br>
advantageous for the power supply device of the submarine to<br>
also have an HTS current limiter in conjunction with the<br>
fitting or retrofitting of fuel cell devices which HTS current<br>
limiter interacts with a circuit breaker and is cooled by means<br>
of a cryogenic liquid. A current limiter such as this operates<br>
with virtually no delay and represents the optimum protection<br>
for a fuel cell system and is therefore particularly<br>
advantageous for the power supply device according to the<br>
invention. The physical principles of an HTS current limiter<br>
have already been known for a long time, but HTS<br><br>
current limiters have now reached a maturity level which allows<br>
them to be cooled with liquid nitrogen. The liquid nitrogen can<br>
advantageously be produced by a compressor from the nitrogen in<br>
the air or, it is also possible to carry liquid nitrogen on<br>
board the submarine. For this purpose, the submarine<br>
advantageously has a supply container for cryogenic liquid, in<br>
particular for liquid nitrogen, which is cooled in particular<br>
by means of electrical equipment.<br>
In this case, it is particularly advantageous for a submarine<br>
which has a fuel cell device on board for the HTS current<br>
limiter to be connected to a supply container whose<br>
vaporization heat is used to heat the liquid oxygen which is<br>
provided for operation of the fuel cell device. It is<br>
particularly advantageous in this case for the HTS current<br>
limiter and the supply container to be arranged in the same<br>
segment as the power supply installation. Particularly if the<br>
HTS current limiter is arranged in the, for example,<br>
retrofitted AIP disk, this results in a retrofit segment for a<br>
submarine which contains the power supply components to be<br>
retrofitted in an optimum manner, so that there is no need to<br>
arrange them in the original boat body, which in fact is<br>
utilized down to the last small nook.<br>
When in the superconducting state, every HTS current limiter<br>
has a negligibly small electrical resistance which cannot be<br>
measured. In the case of a current which is above the rated<br>
current, the electrical resistance of the HTS current limiter<br>
rises suddenly until it changes over from its superconducting<br>
state to its normally conductive state. The HTS current limiter<br>
and its superconductor then assumes a finite resistance, until<br>
it is cooled down again.<br>
As in the exemplary embodiments described above, the HTS<br>
current limiter is used in a power supply system in<br><br>
conjunction with a DC-isolating element with a disconnection<br>
capability. It is also possible to use load-disconnecter<br>
switches. The DC-isolating element is driven automatically.<br>
This is done using the voltage difference which occurs between<br>
the input and output sides of the HTS current limiter in the<br>
normally conductive state. The DC-isolating element is<br>
reconnected by hand, once the short circuit has been rectified.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail with reference<br>
to accompanying drawings from which, as well as from the dependent claims,<br>
further details which are significant to the invention can be<br>
obtained.<br>
In detail:<br>
FIGURE 1 shows the outline illustration of a submarine<br>
propulsion system with a fuel cell device,<br>
FIGURE 2 shows the outline illustration of a submarine<br>
propulsion system with a fuel cell device, which has<br>
been retrofitted,<br>
FIGURE 3 shows the outline circuit diagram of a two-pole<br>
circuit breaker,<br>
FIGURE 4 shows the outline circuit diagram of a three-pole<br>
circuit breaker, and<br>
FIGURE 5 shows the principle of an HTS current limiter system.<br>
In Figure 1, 1 denotes the propulsion motor of the submarine,<br>
which in this case may be a DC motor or a DC-fed motor. 2<br>
denotes the generators which are generally driven by diesel<br>
engines and which charge the battery sets 3 during the snorkel<br>
phase. 4 denotes the fuel cell device and 5 the general<br>
charging connection. 6 denotes, by way of example, a fuse link<br>
and 7 a circuit breaker, in which case the circuit breaker may<br>
respond with (zv) or without (nv) a time delay. 6 and 7 are<br>
identified by symbols which are repeated in the drawing,<br><br>
although the arrangement of the circuit breakers and fuse links<br>
is in this case<br><br>
purely an example. Since this is an outline circuit, the<br>
illustration does not mean that the individual components are<br>
arranged in a corresponding manner in the submarine, and in<br>
fact they are distributed where they are matched to the spatial<br>
conditions. For example, the propulsion motor with its<br>
propeller is always arranged in the stern, but has no role for<br>
the outline circuit.<br>
In Figure 2, which shows the outline circuit of a propulsion<br>
system of a submarine which is used by way of example for new<br>
submarines, the same components as those in Figure 1 are<br>
denoted with the same symbols. The outline circuit can thus be<br>
understood without any problems by a person skilled in the art,<br>
in the same way, the person skilled in the art can immediately<br>
understand Figure 3 and Figure 4, since they use the generally<br>
conventional symbols in electrical engineering, so that there<br>
is no need for a separate description with reference symbols.<br>
Figure 5 shows the principle of an HTS current limiter system<br>
whose use in modern submarines is particularly advantageous in<br>
the same way as the use of fuel cell devices - as already<br>
explained in the above description. The current limiter system<br>
is denoted 10 and contains a cryostat 11 with current limiter<br>
modules 12 which are generally equipped with plates on which<br>
meandering HTS conductors are located. These are conductors<br>
without any resistance in the operating temperature state, but,<br>
when a predeterminable current density is exceeded, they lose<br>
their superconductivity, thus resulting in a non-conductive<br>
state. Since this is based on physical processes, the non-<br>
conductive state is reached with virtually no delay. An arc is<br>
thus suppressed as it occurs.<br>
The current limiter modules are cooled by means of a cryogenic<br>
liquid, advantageously liquid nitrogen, although liquid neon<br>
can also be used. The cryogenic liquid<br><br>
is kept continuously at the low temperature level by means of<br>
the cold head 13, allowing the superconductivity of the<br>
meandering conductors on the plates of the current limiter<br>
modules.<br>
The current supply and return pass via the busbars 14, 15 so<br>
that this results in the capability to fit and remove the HTS<br>
current limiter that is comparable to that of a circuit<br>
breaker. The temperature in the cryostat can be reached either<br>
by means of the cold head or else by vaporization of the<br>
coolant. In this case, it must of course be possible to<br>
compensate for the volume loss of the coolant by replenishment<br>
at any time. In one particularly advantageous embodiment, the<br>
cold head is cooled by a compressor 16 which is water cooled.<br>
The cold head is controlled and regulated in a unit 17 and the<br>
same applies to the compressor. Since the HTS current limiter<br>
has no switching characteristic, it advantageously operates in<br>
series with a circuit breaker, which opens the circuit after<br>
response of the current limiter and disconnection of the<br>
current flowing through the current limiter, thus allowing the<br>
current limiter to resume operation correctly once the cause of<br>
it responding has been rectified. To this extent, the current<br>
limiter advantageously interacts with a circuit breaker, thus<br>
resulting in a safe and reliable power generation and switching<br>
system on board the submarine, which allows operation even when<br>
subject to war influences when traveling underwater, without<br>
any considerable resultant voltage dips and major arcing noise.<br><br><br>
