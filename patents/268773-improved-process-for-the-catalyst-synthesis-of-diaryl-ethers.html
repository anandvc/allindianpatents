				<td>Improved process for the catalytic synthesis of diaryl ethers<br>
The present invention relates to an advantageous process for the catalytic synthesis of diaryl ethers.<br>
For a long time, the Ullmann coupling was the method of choice for the preparation of diaryl ethers. Large, usually overstoichiometric quantities of copper or copper salts, an excess of phenol and high temperatures were used to convert aryl halides into the corresponding diaryl ethers (J. Lindley, Tetrahedron 1984, 40, 1433-1456).<br>
An improved method was introduced applying palladium catalysts in the late 90's (e. g. J. F. Hartwig, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 1998, 37, 2047-2067; R. A. Widenhoefer, H. A. Zhong, S. L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1997, 119, 6787-6795). Although the procedures have been further optimized during the next years (e. g. S. Harkal, K. Kumar, D. Michalik, A. Zapf, R. Jackstell, F. Rataboul, T. Riermeier, A. Monsees, M. Seller, Tetrahedron Lett. 2005, 46, 3237-3240), a common drawback of all palladium-catalyzed reactions is price of the catalyst metal and the need for often expensive phosphine ligands.<br>
Attempts to improve the classical copper-mediated Ullmann coupling reaction aim at rendering the reaction catalytic, with reduced copper content at lower temperatures, by varying the base, solvents and especially the use of ligands.<br>
Song and co-workers (E. Buck, Z. J. Song, D. Tschaen, P. G. Dormer, R. P. Volante, P. J. Reider, Org. Lett. 2002, 4, 1623-1626) reported that 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione can be applied as a suitable ligand for coupling various aryl bromides with phenols. This modification brought significant improvements to reactions which usually do not work well with the classical procedure of the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis, e.g. in case of coupling reactions of aryl halides possessing electron-donating groups with phenols possessing electron-withdrawing groups. However, phenols with strong electron-withdrawing groups did not undergo the desired ether formation and phenols with ort/jo-methoxy and -acetoxy groups reacted slowly.<br>
Cai et al. (Q. Cai, B. L. Zou, D. W. Ma, Angew. Chem. Int. Edit. 2006, 45, 1276-1279) described a very efficient ligand, N,N-dimethylglycine, for acceleration of the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis. The application of this ligand allows the reaction to be performed in dioxane at 90 째C, which is a very low temperature for Ullmann diaryl ether coupling. Both electron-rich and electron-poor aryl halides are suitable substrates for this reaction and provide the corresponding diaryl ethers in good to excellent yields. Steric hindrance in both aryl halides and phenols slightly disfavored the reaction. However, when higher temperature and higher catalyst and ligand loading were applied, this obstacle was overcome. For example, in the reaction of sterically hindered 2-bromotoluene<br><br>
with 4-methoxyphenol, good yields were obtained by raising the reaction temperature to 105 째C. L-Proline was also reported to be an effective additive for acceleration of the reaction.<br>
Another contribution in this respect was made by Hauptman and co-workers (P. J. Pagan, E. Hauptman, R. Shapiro, A. Casalnuovo, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 722, 5043-5051) who systematically investigated different ligands by 'intelligent/random library screening' of a broad range of mono-, bi- and tridendate pyridine-containing ligands in the copper-catalysed coupling of 2-bromo-4,6-dimethylaniline with sodium phenolate. It turned out that in diglyme or dimethoxyethane, the use of bidendate chelators with small 'biteangles', especially 2-aminopyridine and 8-hydroxyquinoline, was most successful and provided better yields with lower amounts of reduced arene by-product. On the other hand, the most effective ligands did not work well in other solvents, suggesting the complexity of this reaction.<br>
Hosseinzadeh et al. (R. Hosseinzadeh, M. Tajbakhsh, M. Mohadjerani, M. Alikarami, Synlett 2005, 1101-1104) reported an improvement in the synthesis of diaryl ethers from phenols and aryl iodides (X = I) in the presence of copper(I) iodide using 1,10-phenanthroline as a ligand and potassium fluoride supported on aluminum oxide as a base.<br>
Among the best ligands in copper-mediated diaryl ether synthesis to date are the multidentate N-donors Chxn-Py-Al,, salicylaldoxime (Salox) and dimethylglyoxime (DMG) described by Cristau et al. (H.-J. Cristau, P. P. Cellier, S. Hamada, J.-F. Spindler, M. Taillefer, Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 913-916). The reaction was carried out in acetonitrile at 80 째C, which is one of the lowest temperatures used in the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis, with copper(I) oxide as pre-catalyst. Aryl iodides showed higher reactivity compared to aryl bromides. High yields (80-100 %) of diaryl ethers were also obtained when the reaction was carried out in DMF at 110 째C. The method was effective as well for coupling of sterically hindered o-cresol and 2-iodotoluene. The major drawback of this method was its inability to couple electron-poor phenols.<br>
Other authors tried to improve the Ullmann diaryl ether synthesis by modifying a catalyst, instead of adding a ligand, in order to achieve enhanced catalyst solubility. A new variation was reported by Snieckus and co-workers (A. V. Kalinin, J. F. Bower, P. Riebel, V. Snieckus, J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64, 2986-2987), who employed CuPF6(MeCN)4 (5 mol%) rather than the air-labile (CuOTf)2-C6H6 complex (J. F. Marcoux, S. Doye, S. L. Buchwald, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 10539-10540) in refluxing toluene or xylenes in the presence of Cs2CO3 as base. The synthetic scope of this modification was established in the coupling of o-iodo- and o-bromo-benzamides and -benzenesulfonamides with phenols. In contrast to Buchwald's system ortho secondary and tertiary benzamides were well tolerated in the coupling process with a negligible difference in yields<br>
between iodides and bromides. E.g., N-ethyl-2-(7w-tolyloxy)-benzamide was obtained in 88 % yield from N-ethyl-2-iodobenzamide and m-cresol.<br>
Gujadhur and Venkataraman reported the use of air- and moisture-stable Cu(PPh3)3Br complex as a modified catalyst for the synthesis of diaryl ethers (R. Gujadhur, D. Venkataraman, Synth. Commun. 2001, 31, 2865-2879). The catalyst is soluble in most organic solvents and the reaction does not require any co-solvents. Using this method phenols can be coupled with electron-deficient aryl bromides such as 4-bromo-l-nitrobenzene and 4-bromobenzonitrile in N-methylpyrrolidinone. However, despite good yields (55-88 %) in the coupling of electron-rich aryl bromides with electron-rich phenols, electron-deficient phenols could not be coupled.<br>
The solubility of the copper catalyst can also be enhanced by the use of phenanthroline ligands. In R. K. Gujadhur, C. G. Bates, D. Venkataraman, Org. Lett. 2001, 3, 4315-4317 two air- and moisture-stable copper-phenanthroline complexes are described for the coupling of aryl bromides and phenols to form diaryl ethers in good yields (10 mol % Cu(neocup)(PPh3)Br, Cs2CO3, toluene, 110 째C, 36 h). However, yields of diaryl ethers were substantially lower for aryl bromides bearing ortho substituents (31 % yields for coupling p-methylphenol with o-methylbromobenzene).<br>
For coupling of o- and p-substituted phenols with inactivated aryl bromides and iodides, Xu et al. (L.-W. Xu, C.-G. Xia, J.-W. Li, X.-X. Hu, Synlett 2003, 2071-2073) reported a ligandless cross-coupling method using a Raney nickel-aluminum alloy, which participates in the formation of the reactive intermediate, thereby increasing the rate of its subsequent reaction. Various copper salts (e.g. CuCl, CuBr, Cul) in dioxane, DMF or NMP at 110 째C were used in the absence of a ligand.<br>
Comdom and Palacios (R. F. P. Comdom, M. L. D. Palacios, Synth. Commun. 2003, 33, 921-926) used ultrasound to prepare diaryl ethers from phenols and aryl halides in a pyridine/ K2CO3 system. The yields obtained were equal or superior to those reported in the literature where a high-boiling alcohol (130-170 째C) was employed as solvent.<br>
Ren and co-workers (Y. T. Luo, J. X. Wu, R. X. Ren, Synlett 2003, 1734-1736) used halide-based ionic liquids as solvents, particularly l-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium halides (bmiX). While copper and palladium salts were assayed as catalysts, only copper salts proved successful in promoting formation of diaryl ethers. The method works well only with aryl iodides, also the high initial price of the solvent may be prohibitive.<br>
Another, novel catalyst system consists of 20 mol % Cul, 30 mol % dimethylaminomethylphos-phonic acid derivatives as ligands and K2CO3 in toluene (Y. Jin, J. Y. Liu, Y. W. Yin, H. Fu, Y. Y. Jiang, Y. F. Zhao, Synlett2006, 1564-1568).<br>
Immobilized copper in organic-inorganic hybrid materials has been described to catalyze the Ullmann reaction of phenols and aryl iodides, bromides or chlorides (T. Miao, L. Wang, Tetrahedron Lett., 2007, 48, 95-99). The protocol involves the use of DMSO as the solvent, and potassium fluoride as the base. The reactions generated the corresponding cross-coupling products in good to excellent yields. Furthermore, the silica-supported copper could be recovered and recycled by simple filtration of the reaction solution and used for 10 consecutive trials without loss of its reactivity. However, both the solvent and the base are not feasable for industrial production.<br>
Copper impregnated charcoal catalyzes cross-couplings between aryl bromides and phenols (B. H. Lipshutz, J. B. Unger, B. R. Taft, Org. Lett. 2007, 9, 1089-1092). The etherifications are promoted by microwave heating.<br>
Another new method has been provided by R.-S. Zeng and coworkers (A. Wang, R. S. Zeng, H. Q. Wei, A. Q. Jia, J. P. Zou, Chin. J. Chem., 2006, 24, 1062-1065). Here, the coupling is performed with 2 mol % copper(II) chloride and 7.5 mol % 2,2'-bisimidazol in DMF at 100 째C. Severe drawbacks of this protocol are the limitation to aryl iodides and the use of expensive Cs2CO3 as base.<br>
There was still the need, therefore, to provide a process which makes it possible to prepare diaryl ethers with good yield and selectivity.<br>
The invention is directed to a catalyst system which enables a novel procedure for the formation of diaryl ethers from aryl or heteroaryl bromides and phenols using copper salts in the presence of inexpensive 1-subtituted imidazoles as additive/ligand and a alkali compound in an appropriate solvent. Under these conditions, both electron-poor and electron-rich aryl bromides react with phenols with good to excellent yield and selectivity making the method applicable on an industrial scale.<br>
It has now be found a new process for preparing diaryl ethers of the formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Ar is an aryl or substituted aryl group and Ar' is an aryl, substituted aryl or heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl group<br>
by reacting an aryl of formula (II) or a aryloxy salt of formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Ar has the same meaning as in formula (I) and R is an alkali metal,<br>
with an aryl or heteroaryl bromide of formula (IV)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which Ar' has the same meaning as in formula (I),<br>
characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of a copper (I) salt and a 1-substituted imidazole as catalyst system.<br>
Ar is an aryl or substituted aryl particulary a phenyl-, substituted phenyl-, cresyl-, aniline-, bromo-aniline or biphenyl-group and Ar' is an aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl particulary a phenyl-, substituted phenyl-, cresyl-, pyridinyl or naphthyl-group.<br>
A distinctive advantage of the catalyst system according to the invention is that multifunctional substrates such as 4-bromoaniline show no sign of self-coupling, indicating a complete selectivity of the catalytic system towards the reaction at the oxygen atom.<br>
The use of an aryloxy salt of formula (III) like a phenolate, is preferred. Typically the alkali aryloxy salt of formula (III) such as lithium, sodium or potassium aryloxy salt is prepared in situ. The alkali compound employed for preparing the aryloxy salt of formula (III) is preferably an alkali earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide like sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium methylate, much suitable an alkali earth salt of weak organic acids like sodium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate.<br>
One compound of the catalyst used in our invention is a copper (I) salt such as CuBr, CuF, CuCN, Cul, CuCl or Cu2O. Preferred is Cul or CuCl. The salt may be added in amounts of 0,01 mol-% to 100 mol-% calculated from the amount of the compound of formula (IV). Preferably the salt is added in an amount of 1 mol-% to 10 mol-%.<br>
As second compound of the catalyst system is a 1-substituted imidazole used, wherein the substituant is an alkyl, phenyl, alkenyl or acyl group, like 1-Methylmidazole, 1-Benzylimidazol, 1-Phenylimidazol, 1-Acetylimidazol, more preferably 1-Butylimidazole. The catalyst is added in amounts of 1 mol-% to 500 mol-% or could be used as solvent for the reaction, preferably the catalyst as added in amounts of 50 mol-% to 200 mol-%, calculated from the amount of the compound of formula (IV).<br>
The preferred reaction temperature is comprised between 60 째C and 200 째C, more preferably between 100 째C and 140 째C.<br><br>
In general the reactions are carried out in an appropriate solvent, including aromatic hydrocarbons like toluene, xylenes, mesitylene, chlorbenzene, dichlorbenzene. As mentioned above, the ligand used in the reaction could also be used as solvent for example 1-Butylimidazole.<br>
In summary, the invention describes the application of a new catalyst system for the formation of diaryl ethers from aryl or heteroaryl bromides and phenols using copper salts in the presence of 1-subtituted imidazoles as additive/ligand.<br>
