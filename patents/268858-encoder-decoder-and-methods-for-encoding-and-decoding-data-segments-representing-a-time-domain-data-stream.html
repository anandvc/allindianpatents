				<td>Encoder, Decoder and Methods for Encoding and Decoding Data<br>
Segments representing a time-domain Data Stream<br>
Description<br>
The present invention is in the field of coding, where<br>
different characteristics of data to be encoded are<br>
utilized for coding rates, as for example in video and<br>
audio coding.<br>
State of the art coding strategies can make use of<br>
characteristics of a data stream to be encoded. For<br>
example, in audio coding, perception models are used in<br>
order to compress source data almost without decreasing the<br>
noticeable quality and degradation when replayed. Modern<br>
perceptual audio coding schemes, such as for example, MPEG-<br>
2/4 AAC (MPEG = Moving Pictures Expert Group, AAC =<br>
Advanced Audio Coding), cf. Generic Coding of Moving<br>
Pictures and Associated Audio: Advanced Audio Coding,<br>
International Standard 13818-7, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11<br>
Moving Pictures Expert Group, 1997, may use filter banks,<br>
such as for example the Modified Discrete Cosine Transform<br>
(MDCT), for representing the audio signal in the frequency<br>
domain.<br>
In the frequency domain quantization of frequency<br>
coefficients can be carried out, according to a perceptual<br>
model. Such coders can provide excellent perceptual audio<br>
quality for general types of audio signals as, for example,<br>
music. On the other hand, modern speech coders, such as,<br>
for example, ACELP (ACELP = Algebraic Code Excited Linear<br>
Prediction), use a predictive approach, and in this way may<br>
represent the audio/speech signal in the time domain. Such<br>
speech coders can model the characteristics of the human<br>
speech production process, i.e.. the human vocal tract and,<br>
consequently, achieve excellent performance for speech<br>
signals at low bit rates. Conversely, perceptional audio<br>
coders do not achieve the level of performance offered by<br>
Translation of the Version as Originally Filed<br><br>
speech coders for speech signals coded at low bit rates,<br>
and using speech coders to represent general audio<br>
signals/music results in significant quality impairments.<br>
Conventional concepts provide a layered combination in<br>
which always all partial coders are active, i.e. time-<br>
domain and frequency-domain encoders, and the final output<br>
signal is calculated by combining the contributions of the<br>
partial coders for a given processed time frame. A popular<br>
example of layered coding are MPEG-4 scalable speech/audio<br>
coding with a speech coder as the base layer and a<br>
filterbank-based enhancement layer, cf. Bernhard Grill,<br>
Karlheinz Brandenburg, "A Two-or Three-Stage Bit-Rate<br>
Scalable Audio Coding System", Preprint Number 4132, 99th<br>
Convention of the AES (September 1995).<br>
Conventional frequency-domain encoders can make use of MDCT<br>
filterbanks. The MDCT has become a dominant filterbank for<br>
conventional perceptual audio coders because of its<br>
advantageous properties. For example, it can provide a<br>
smooth cross-fade between processing blocks. Even if a<br>
signal in each processing block is altered differently, for<br>
example due to quantization of spectral coefficients, no<br>
blocking artifacts due to abrupt transitions from block to<br>
block occur because of the windowed overlap/add operations.<br>
The MDCT uses the concept of time-domain aliasing<br>
cancellation (TDAC).<br>
The MDCT is a Fourier-related transform based on the type-<br>
IV discrete cosine transform, with the additional property<br>
of being lapped. It is designed to be performed in<br>
consecutive blocks of a larger data set, where subsequent<br>
blocks are overlapped so that the last half of one block<br>
coincides with the first half of the next block. This<br>
overlapping, in addition to an energy-compaction quality of<br>
the DCT, makes the MDCT especially attractive for signal<br>
compression applications, since it helps to avoid said<br>
artifacts stemming from the block boundaries. As a lapped<br>
Translation of the Version as Originally Filed, Errors Corrected<br><br>
transform, the MDCT is a bit unusual compared to other<br>
Fourier-related transforms in that it has half as many<br>
outputs as inputs, instead of the same number. In<br>
particular, 2N real numbers are transformed into N real<br>
numbers, where N is a positive integer.<br>
The inverse MDCT is also known as IMDCT. Because there are<br>
different numbers of inputs and outputs, at first glance it<br>
might seem that the MDCT should not be invertible. However,<br>
perfect invertibility is achieved by adding the overlap<br>
IDMCTs of subsequent overlapping blocks, causing the errors<br>
to cancel and the original data to be retrieved, i.e.<br>
achieving TDAC.<br>
Therewith, the number of spectral values at the output of a<br>
filterbank is equal to the number of time-domain input<br>
values at its input which is also referred to as critical<br>
sampling.<br>
An MDCT filterbank provides a high-frequency selectivity<br>
and enables a high coding gain. The properties of<br>
overlapping of blocks and critical sampling can be achieved<br>
by utilizing the technique of time-domain aliasing<br>
cancellation, cf. J. Princen, A. Bradley,<br>
"Analysis/Synthesis Filter Bank Design Based on Time Domain<br>
Aliasing Cancellation", IEEE Trans. ASSP, ASSP-34(5):1153-<br>
1161, 1986. Fig. 4 illustrates these effects of an MDCT.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an MDCT input signal, in terms of an impulse<br>
along a time axis 400 at the top. The input signal 400 is<br>
then transformed by two consecutive windowing and MDCT<br>
blocks, where the windows 410 are illustrated underneath<br>
the input signal 400 in Fig. 4. The back transformed<br>
individual windowed signals are displayed in Fig. 4 by the<br>
time lines 420 and 425.<br>
After the inverse MDCT, the first block produces an<br>
aliasing component with positive sign 420, the second block<br>
produces an aliasing component with the same magnitude and<br>
Translation of the Version as Originally Filed<br><br>
a negative sign 425. The aliasing components cancel each<br>
other after addition of the two output signals 420 and 425<br>
as shown in the final output 430 at the bottom of Fig. 4.<br>
In "Extended Adaptive Multi-Rate - Wideband (AMR-WB+)<br>
codec", 3GPP TS 26.290V6.3.0, 2005-06, Technical<br>
Specification the AMR-WB+ (AMR-WB = Adaptive Multi-Rate<br>
Wideband) codec is specified. According to section 5.2, the<br>
encoding algorithm at the core of the AMR-WB+ codec is<br>
based on a hybrid ACELP/TCX (TCX = Transform coded<br>
Excitation) model. For every block of an input signal the<br>
encoder decides, either in an open loop or a closed loop<br>
mode which encoding model, i.e. ACELP or TCX, is best. The<br>
ACELP model is a time-domain, predictive encoder, best<br>
suited for speech and transient signals. The AMR-WB encoder<br>
is used in ACELP modes. Alternatively, the TCX model is a<br>
transform based encoder, and is more appropriate for<br>
typical music samples.<br>
Specifically, the AMR-WB+ uses a discrete Fourier transform<br>
(DFT) for the transform coding mode TCX. In order to allow<br>
a smooth transition between adjacent blocks, a windowing<br>
and overlap is used. This windowing and overlap is<br>
necessary both for transitions between different coding<br>
modes (TCX/ACELP) and for consecutive TCX frames. Thus, the<br>
DFT together with the windowing and overlap represents a<br>
filterbank that is not critically sampled. The filterbank<br>
produces more frequency values than the number of new input<br>
samples, cf. Fig. 4 in 3GPP TS 26.290V6.3.0 (3GPP = Third<br>
Generation Partnership Project, TS = Technical<br>
Specification). Each TCX frame utilizes an overlap of 1/8<br>
of the frame length which equals the number of new input<br>
samples. Consequently, the corresponding length of the DFT<br>
is 9/8 of the frame length.<br>
Considering the non-critically sampled DFT filterbank in<br>
the TCX, i.e. the number of spectral values at the output<br>
of the filterbank is larger than the number of time-domain<br>
Translation of the Version as Originally Filed<br><br>
input values at its input, this frequency domain coding mode<br>
is different from audio codecs such as AAC (AAC = Advanced<br>
Audio Coding) which utilizes an MDCT, a critically sampled<br>
lapped transform.<br>
The Dolby E codec is described in Fielder, Louis D.; Todd,<br>
Craig C, "The Design of a Video Friendly Audio Coding System<br>
for Distributing Applications", Paper Number 17-008, The AES<br>
17th International Conference: High-Quality Audio Coding<br>
(August 1999) and Fielder, Louis D.; Davidson, Grant A.,<br>
"Audio Coding Tools for Digital Television Distribution",<br>
Preprint Number 5104, 108th Convention of the AES (January<br>
2000). The Dolby E codec utilizes the MDCT filterbank. In the<br>
design of this coding, special focus was put on the<br>
possibility to perform editing in the coding domain. To<br>
achieve this, special alias-free windows are used. At the<br>
boundaries of these windows a smooth-cross fade or splicing of<br>
different signal portions is possible. In the above-referenced<br>
documents it is, for example, outlined, cf. section 3 of "The<br>
Design of a Video Friendly Audio Coding System for<br>
Distribution Applications", that this would not be possible by<br>
simply using the usual MDCT windows which introduce time-<br>
domain aliasing. However, it is also described that the<br>
removal of aliasing comes at the cost of an increased number<br>
of transform coefficients, indicating that the resulting<br>
filterbank does not have the property of critical sampling<br>
anymore.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a more<br>
efficient concept for encoding and decoding data segments.<br>
The object is achieved by an apparatus for decoding according<br>
to claim 1, a method for decoding according to claim 22, an<br>
apparatus for generating an encoded data stream according to<br>
claim 2 4 and a method for generating an encoded data stream<br>
according to claim 35.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a more<br>
efficient encoding and decoding concept can be utilized by<br>
using combined time-domain and frequency-domain encoders,<br>
respectively decoders. The problem of time aliasing can be<br>
efficiently combat by transforming time-domain data to the<br>
frequency-domain in the decoder and by combining the<br>
resulting transformed frequency-domain data with the<br>
decoded frequency-domain data received. Overheads can be<br>
reduced by adapting overlapping regions of overlap windows<br>
being applied to data segments to coding domain changes.<br>
Using windows with smaller overlapping regions can be<br>
beneficial when using time-domain encoding, respectively<br>
when switching from or to time-domain encoding.<br>
Embodiments can provide a universal audio encoding and<br>
decoding concept that achieves improved performance for<br>
both types of input signals, such as speech signals and<br>
music signals. Embodiments can take advantage by combining<br>
multiple coding approaches, e.g. time-domain and frequency-<br>
domain coding concepts. Embodiments can efficiently combine<br>
filterbank based and time-domain based coding concepts into<br>
a single scheme. Embodiments may result in a combined codec<br>
which can, for example, be able to switch between an audio<br>
codec for music-like audio content and a speech codec for<br>
speech-like content. Embodiments may utilize this switching<br>
frequently, especially for mixed content.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may provide the<br>
advantage that no switching artifacts occur. In embodiments<br>
the amount of additional transmit data, or additionally<br>
coded samples, for a switching process can be minimized in<br>
order to avoid a reduced efficiency during this phase of<br>
operation. Therewith the concept of switched combination of<br>
partial coders is different from that of the layered<br>
combination in which always all partial coders are active.<br><br>

Fig. la shows an apparatus 100 for decoding data segments<br>
representing a time-domain data stream, a data segment<br>
being encoded in a time domain or in a freguency domain, a<br>
data segment being encoded in the frequency domain having<br>
successive blocks of data representing successive and<br>
overlapping blocks of time-domain data samples. This data<br>
stream could, for example, correspond to an audio stream,<br>
wherein some of the data blocks are encoded in the time<br>
domain and other ones are encoded in the frequency domain.<br>
Data blocks or segments which have been encoded in the<br>
frequency domain, may represent time-domain data samples of<br>
overlapping data blocks.<br>
The apparatus 100 comprises a time-domain decoder 110 for<br>
decoding a data segment being encoded in the time domain.<br>
Furthermore, the apparatus 100 comprises a processor 120<br>
for processing the data segment being encoded in the<br>
frequency domain and output data of the time-domain decoder<br>
110 to obtain overlapping time-domain data blocks.<br>
Moreover, the apparatus 100 comprises an overlap/add-<br>
combiner 130 for combining the overlapping time-domain data<br>
blocks to obtain the decoded data segments of the time-<br>
domain data stream.<br>
Fig. lb shows another embodiment of the apparatus 100. In<br>
embodiments the processor 120 may comprise a frequency-<br>
domain decoder 122 for decoding data segments being encoded<br>
in the frequency domain to obtain frequency-domain data<br>
segments. Moreover, in embodiments the processor 120 may<br><br>
comprise a time-domain to frequency-domain converter 124<br>
for converting the output data of the time-domain decoder<br>
110 to obtain converted frequency-domain data segments.<br>
Furthermore, in embodiments the processor 120 may comprise<br>
a frequency-domain combiner 126 for combining the<br>
frequency-domain segments and the converted frequency-<br>
domain data segments to obtain a frequency-domain data<br>
stream. The processor 120 may further comprise a frequency-<br>
domain to time-domain converter 128 for converting the<br>
frequency-domain data stream to overlapping time-domain<br>
data blocks which can then be combined by the overlap/add-<br>
combiner 130.<br>
Embodiments may utilize an MDCT filterbank, as for example,<br>
used in MPEG-4 AAC, without any modifications, especially<br>
without giving up the property of critical sampling.<br>
Embodiments may provide optimum coding efficiency.<br>
Embodiments may achieve a smooth transition to a time-<br>
domain codec compatible with the established MDCT windows<br>
while introducing no additional switching artifacts and<br>
only a minimal overhead.<br>
Embodiments may keep the time-domain aliasing in the<br>
filterbank and intentionally introduce a corresponding<br>
time-domain aliasing into the signal portions coded by the<br>
time-domain codec. Thus, resulting components of the time-<br>
domain aliasing can cancel each other out in the same way<br>
as they do for two consecutive frames of the MDCT spectra.<br>
Fig. 1c illustrates another embodiment of an apparatus 100.<br>
According to Fig. lc the frequency-domain decoder 122 can<br>
comprise a re-quantization stage 122a. Moreover, the time-<br>
domain to frequency-domain converter 124 can comprise a<br>
cosine modulated filterbank, an extended lapped transform,<br>
a low delay filterbank or a polyphase filterbank. The<br>
embodiment shown in Fig. lc illustrates that the time-<br><br>
domain to frequency-domain converter 124 can comprise an<br>
MDCT 124a.<br>
Furthermore, Fig. 1c depicts that the frequency-domain<br>
combiner 126 may comprise an adder 126a. As shown in Fig.<br>
lc, the frequency-domain to time-domain converter 128 can<br>
comprise a cosine modulated filterbank, respectively an<br>
inverse MDCT 128a. The data stream comprising time-domain<br>
encoded and frequency-domain encoded data segment may be<br>
generated by an encoder which will be further detailed<br>
below. The switching between frequency-domain encoding and<br>
time-domain encoding can be achieved by encoding some<br>
portions of the input signal with a frequency-domain<br>
encoder and some input signal portions with a time-domain<br>
encoder. The embodiment of the apparatus 100 depicted in<br>
Fig. lc illustrates the principle structure of a<br>
corresponding apparatus 100 for decoding. In other<br>
embodiments the re-quantization 122a and the inverse<br>
modified discrete cosine transform 128a can represent a<br>
frequency-domain decoder.<br>
As indicated in Fig. lc for signal portions where the time-<br>
domain decoder 110 takes over, the time-domain output of<br>
the time-domain decoder 110 can be transformed by the<br>
forward MDCT 124a. The time-domain decoder may utilize a<br>
prediction filter to decode the time-domain encoded data.<br>
Some overlap in the input of the MDCT 124a and thus some<br>
overhead may be introduced here. In the following<br>
embodiments will be described which reduce or minimize this<br>
overhead.<br>
In principle, the embodiment shown in Fig. lc also<br>
comprises an operation mode where both codecs can operate<br>
in parallel. In embodiments the processor 120 can be<br>
adapted for processing a data segment being encoded in<br>
parallel in the time domain and in the frequency domain. In<br>
this way the signal can partially be coded in the frequency<br>
domain and partially in the time domain, similar to a<br><br>
layered coding approach. The resulting signals are then<br>
added up in the frequency domain, compare the frequency-<br>
domain combiner 126a. Nevertheless, embodiments may carry<br>
out a mode of operation which is to switch exclusively<br>
between the two codecs and only have a preferably minimum<br>
number of samples where both codecs are active in order to<br>
obtain best possible efficiency.<br>
In Fig. 1c, the output of the time-domain decoder 110 is<br>
transformed by the MDCT 124ar followed by the IMDCT 128a.<br>
In another embodiment, these two steps may be<br>
advantageously combined into a single step in order to<br>
reduce complexity. Fig. 1d illustrates an embodiment of an<br>
apparatus 100 illustrating this approach. The apparatus 100<br>
shown in Fig. 1d illustrates that the processor 120 may<br>
comprise a calculator 129 for calculating overlapping time-<br>
domain data blocks based on the output data of the time-<br>
domain decoder 110. The processor 120 or the calculator 129<br>
can be adapted for reproducing a property respectively an<br>
overlapping property of the frequency-domain to time-domain<br>
converter 128 based on the output data of the time-domain<br>
decoder 110, i.e. the processor 120 or calculator 129 may<br>
reproduce an overlapping characteristic of time-domain data<br>
blocks similar to an overlapping characteristic produced by<br>
the frequency-domain to time-domain converter 128.<br>
Moreover, the processor 120 or calculator 129 can be<br>
adapted for reproducing time-domain aliasing similar to<br>
time-domain aliasing introduced by the frequency-domain to<br>
time-domain converter 128 based on the output data of the<br>
time-domain decoder 110.<br>
The frequency-domain to time-domain converter 128 can then<br>
be adapted for converting the frequency-domain data<br>
segments provided by the frequency-domain decoder 122 to<br>
overlapping time-domain data blocks. The overlap/add-<br>
combiner 130 can be adapted for combining data blocks<br>
provided by the frequency-domain to time-domain converter<br><br>
128 and the calculator 129 to obtain the decoded data segments<br>
of the time-domain data stream.<br>
The calculator 129 may comprise a time-domain aliasing stage<br>
129a as it is illustrated in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1e.<br>
The time-domain aliasing stage 129a can be adapted for time-<br>
aliasing output data of the time-domain decoder to obtain the<br>
overlapping time-domain data blocks.<br>
For the time-domain encoded data a combination of the MDCT and<br>
the IMDCT can make the process in embodiments much simpler in<br>
both structure and computational complexity as only the<br>
process of time-domain aliasing (TDA) remains in embodiments.<br>
This efficient process can be based on a number of<br>
observations. The windowed MDCT of the input segments of 2N<br>
samples can be decomposed into three steps.<br>
First, the input signal is multiplied by an analysis window.<br>
Second, the result is then folded down from 2N samples to N<br>
samples. For the MDCT, this process implies that the first<br>
quarter of the samples is combined, i.e. subtracted, in time-<br>
reversed order with the second quarter of the samples, and<br>
that the fourth quarter of the samples is combined, i.e.<br>
added, with the third quarter of the samples in time-reversed<br>
order. The result is the time-aliased, down-sampled signal in<br>
the modified second and third quarter of the signal,<br>
comprising N samples.<br>
Third, the down-sampled signal is then transformed using an<br>
orthogonal DCT-like transform mapping N input to N output<br>
samples to form the final MDCT output.<br>
The windowed IMDCT reconstruction of an input sequence of N<br>
spectral samples can likewise be decomposed into three steps.<br><br>
First, the input sequence of N spectral samples is<br>
transformed using an orthogonal inverse DCT-like transform<br>
mapping N input to N output samples.<br>
Second, the results unfolded from N to 2N samples by<br>
writing the inverse DCT transformed values into the second<br>
and third quarter of a 2N samples output buffer, filling<br>
the first quarter with the time-reversed and inverted<br>
version of the second quarter, and the fourth quarter with<br>
a time-reverse version of the third quarter, respectively.<br>
Third, the resulting 2N samples are multiplied with the<br>
synthesis window to form the windowed IMDCT output.<br>
Thus, a concatenation of the windowed MDCT and the windowed<br>
IMDCT may be efficiently carried out in embodiments by the<br>
sequence of the first and second steps of the windowed MDCT<br>
and the second and third steps of the windowed IMDCT. The<br>
third step of the MDCT and the first step of the IMDCT can<br>
be omitted entirely in embodiments because they are inverse<br>
operations with respect to each other and thus cancel out.<br>
The remaining steps can be carried out in the time domain<br>
only, and thus embodiments using this approach can be<br>
substantially low in computational complexity.<br>
For one bloc, of MDCT and consecutive IMOCT the second and<br>
third step of the MDCT and the second and third step of the<br>
third SteP of the MDCT and the second and third step of the<br>
IMDCT can be written as multiplecation with the following<br>
sparse 2Nx2N matrix.<br><br><br>
In other words, the calculator 129 can be adapted for<br>
segmenting the output of the time-domain decoder 110 in<br>
calculator segments comprising 2N sequential samples,<br>
applying weights to the 2N samples according to an analysis<br>
windowing function, subtracting the first N/2 samples in<br>
reversed order from the second N/2 samples, and the last<br>
N/2 samples in reversed order to the third N/2 samples,<br>
inverting the second and third N/2 samples, replacing the<br>
first N/2 samples with the time-reversed and inverted<br>
version of the second N/2 samples, replacing the fourth N/2<br>
samples with the time reversed version of the third N/2<br>
samples, and applying weights to the 2N samples according<br>
to a synthesis windowing function.<br>
In other embodiments the overlap/add-combiner 130 can be<br>
adapted for applying weights according to a synthesis<br>
windowing function to overlapping time-domain data blocks<br>
provided by the frequency-domain to time-domain converter<br>
128. Furthermore, the overlap/add-combiner 130 can be<br>
adapted for applying weights according to a synthesis<br>
windowing function being adapted to the size of an<br>
overlapping region of consecutive overlapping time-domain<br>
data blocks.<br>
The calculator 129 may be adapted for applying weights to<br>
the 2N samples according to an analysis windowing function<br>
being adapted to the size of an overlapping region of<br><br>
consecutive overlapping time-domain data blocks and the<br>
calculator may be further adapted for applying weights to<br>
the 2N samples according to a synthesis window function<br>
being adapted to the size of the overlapping region.<br>
In embodiments the size of an overlapping region of two<br>
consecutive time-domain data blocks which are encoded in<br>
the frequency-domain can be larger than the size of an<br>
overlapping of two consecutive time-domain data blocks of<br>
which one being encoded in the frequency domain and one<br>
being encoded in the time domain.<br>
In embodiments, the size of the data segments can be<br>
adapted to the size of the overlapping regions. Embodiments<br>
may have an efficient implementation of a combined<br>
MDCT/IMDCT processing, i.e. a block TDA comprising the<br>
operations of analysis windowing, folding and unfolding,<br>
and synthesis windowing. Moreover, in embodiments some of<br>
these steps may be partially or fully combined in an actual<br>
implementation.<br>
Another embodiment of an apparatus 100 as shown in Fig. If<br>
illustrates that an apparatus 100 may further comprise a<br>
bypass 140 for the processor 120 and the overlay/add-<br>
combiner 130 being adapted for bypassing the processor 120<br>
and the overlay/add-combiner 130 when non-overlapping<br>
consecutive time-domain data blocks occur in data segments,<br>
which are encoded in the time domain. If multiple data<br>
segments are encoded in the time domain, i.e. no conversion<br>
to the frequency domain may be necessary for decoding<br>
consecutive data segments, they may be transmitted without<br>
any overlapping. For these cases the embodiments as shown<br>
in Fig. If may bypass the processor 120 and the<br>
overlap/add-combiner 130. In embodiments the overlapping of<br>
blocks can be determined according to the AAC-<br>
specifications.<br><br>
Fig. 2a shows an embodiment of an apparatus 200 for<br>
generating an encoded data stream based on a time-domain<br>
data stream, the time-domain data stream having samples of<br>
a signal. The time-domain data stream could, for example,<br>
correspond to an audio signal, comprising speech sections<br>
and music sections or both at the same time. The apparatus<br>
200 comprises a segment processor 210 for providing data<br>
segments from the data stream, two consecutive data<br>
segments having a first or a second overlapping region, the<br>
second overlapping region being smaller than the first<br>
overlapping region. The apparatus 200 further comprises a<br>
time-domain encoder 220 for encoding a data segment in the<br>
time domain and a frequency-domain encoder 230 for applying<br>
weights to samples of the time-domain data stream according<br>
to a first or a second windowing function to obtain a<br>
windowed data segment, the first and second windowing<br>
functions being adapted to the first and second overlapping<br>
regions and for encoding the windowed data segment in the<br>
frequency domain.<br>
Furthermore, the apparatus 200 comprises a time-domain data<br>
analyzer 240 for determining a transmission indication<br>
associated with a data segment and a controller 250 for<br>
controlling the apparatus such that for data segments<br>
having a first transition indication, output data of the<br>
time-domain encoder 220 is included in the encoded data<br>
stream and for data segments having a second transition<br>
indication, output data of the frequency-domain encoder 230<br>
is included in the encoded data stream.<br>
In embodiments the time-domain data analyzer 240 may be<br>
adapted for determining the transition indication from the<br>
time-domain data stream or from data segments provided by<br>
the segment processor 210. These embodiments are indicated<br>
in Fig. 2b. In Fig. 2b it is illustrated that the time-<br>
domain data analyzer 240 may be coupled to the input of the<br>
segment processor 210 in order to determine the transition<br>
indication from the time-domain data stream. In another<br><br>
embodiment the time-domain data analyzer 240 may be coupled<br>
to the output of the segment processor 210 in order to<br>
determine the transition indication from the data segments.<br>
In embodiments the time-domain data analyzer 240 can be<br>
coupled directly to the segment processor 210 in order to<br>
determine the transition indication from data provided<br>
directly by the segment processor. These embodiments are<br>
indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 2b.<br>
In embodiments the time-domain data analyzer 240 can be<br>
adapted for determining a transition measure, the<br>
transition measure being based on a level of transience in<br>
the time-domain data stream or the data segments wherein<br>
the transition indicator may indicate whether the level of<br>
transience exceeds a predetermined threshold.<br>
Fig. 2c shows another embodiment of the apparatus 200. In<br>
the embodiments shown in Fig. 2c the segment processor 210<br>
can be adapted for providing data segments with the first<br>
and the second overlapping regions, the time-domain encoder<br>
220 can be adapted for encoding all data segments, the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 230 may be adapted for encoding<br>
all windowed data segments and the controller 250 can be<br>
adapted for controlling the time-domain encoder 220 and the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 220 and the frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230 such that for data segments having a first<br>
transition indication, output data of the time-domain<br>
encoder 220 is included in the encoded data stream and for<br>
data segments having a second transition indication, output<br>
data of the frequency-domain encoder 230 is included in the<br>
encoded data stream. In other embodiments both output data<br>
of the time-domain encoder 220 and the frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230 may be included in the encoded data stream. The<br>
transition indicator may be indicating whether a data<br>
segment is rather associated or correlated with a speech<br>
signal or with a music signal. In embodiments the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 230 may be used for more music-<br>
like data segments and the time-domain encoder 220 may be<br><br>
used for more speech-like data segments. In embodiments<br>
parallel encoding may be utilized, e.g. for a speech-like<br>
audio signal having background music.<br>
In the embodiment depicted in Fig. 2c, multiple<br>
possibilities are conceivable for the controller 250 to<br>
control the multiple components within the apparatus 200.<br>
The different possibilities are indicated by dotted lines<br>
in Fig. 2c. For example, the controller 250 could be<br>
coupled to the time-domain encoder 220 and the frequency-<br>
domain encoder 230 in order to choose which encoder should<br>
produce an encoded output based on the transition<br>
indication. In another embodiment the controller 250 may<br>
control a switch at the outputs of the time-domain encoder<br>
220 and the frequency-domain encoder 230.<br>
In such an embodiment both the time-domain encoder 220 and<br>
the frequency-domain encoder 230 may encode all data<br>
segments and the controller 250 may be adapted for choosing<br>
via said switch which is coupled to the outputs of the<br>
encoders, which encoded data segment should be included in<br>
the encoded data stream, based on coding efficiency,<br>
respectively the transition indication. In other<br>
embodiments the controller 250 can be adapted for<br>
controlling the segment processor 210 for providing the<br>
data segments either to the time-domain encoder 220 or the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 230. The controller 250 may also<br>
control the segment processor 210 in order to set<br>
overlapping regions for a data segment. In other<br>
embodiments the controller 250 may be adapted for<br>
controlling a switch between the segment processor 210 and<br>
the time-domain encoder 220, respectively the frequency-<br>
domain encoder 230. The controller 250 could then influence<br>
the switch so to direct data segments to either one of the<br>
encoders, respectively to both. The controller 250 can be<br>
further adapted to set the windowing functions for the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 230 along with the overlapping<br>
regions and coding strategies.<br><br>
Moreover, in embodiments the frequency-domain encoder 230<br>
can be adapted for applying weights of window functions<br>
according to AAC specifications. The frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230 can be adapted for converting a windowed data<br>
segment to the frequency domain to obtain a frequency-<br>
domain data segment. Moreover, the frequency domain encoder<br>
230 can be adapted for quantizing the frequency-domain data<br>
segments and, furthermore, the frequency-domain encoder 230<br>
may be adapted for evaluating the frequency-domain data<br>
segments according to a perceptual model.<br>
The frequency-domain encoder 230 can be adapted for<br>
utilizing a cosine modulated filterbank, an extended lapped<br>
transform, a low-delay filterbank or a polyphase filterbank<br>
to obtain the frequency-domain data segments.<br>
The frequency-domain encoder 230 may be adapted for<br>
utilizing an MDCT to obtain the frequency data segments.<br>
The time-domain encoder 220 can be adapted for using a<br>
prediction model for encoding the data segments.<br>
In embodiments where an MDCT in the frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230 operates in a so-called long block mode, i.e.<br>
the regular mode of operation that is used for coding non-<br>
transient input signals, compare AAC-specifications, the<br>
overhead introduced by the switching process may be high.<br>
This can be true for the cases where only one frame, i.e. a<br>
length/framing rate of N samples, should be coded using the<br>
time-domain encoder 220 instead of the frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230.<br>
Then all the input values for the MDCT may have to be<br>
encoded with the time-domain encoder 220, i.e. 2N samples<br>
are available at the output of the time-domain decoder 110.<br>
Thus, an overhead of N additional samples could be<br>
introduced. Figs. 3a to 3d illustrate some conceivable<br>
overlapping regions of segments, respectively applicable<br><br>
windowing functions. 2N samples may have to be coded with<br>
the time-domain encoder 220 in order to replace one block<br>
of frequency-domain encoded data. Fig. 3a illustrates an<br>
example, where frequency-domain encoded data blocks use a<br>
solid line, and time-domain encoded data uses a dotted<br>
line. Underneath the windowing functions data segments are<br>
depicted which can be encoded in the frequency domain<br>
(solid boxes) or in the time domain (dotted boxes). This<br>
representation will be referred to in Figs. 3b to 3d as<br>
well.<br>
Fig. 3a illustrates the case where data is encoded in the<br>
frequency domain, interrupted by one data segment which is<br>
encoded in the time domain, and the data segment after it<br>
is encoded in the frequency domain again. In order to<br>
provide the time-domain data which is necessary to cancel<br>
the time-domain aliasing evoked by the frequency-domain<br>
encoder 230, when switching from the frequency domain to<br>
the time domain, half of a segment size of overlapping is<br>
required, the same holds from switching back from the time<br>
domain to the frequency domain. Assuming that the time-<br>
domain encoded data segment in Fig. 3a has a size of 2N,<br>
then at its start and at the end it overlaps with the<br>
frequency-domain encoded data by N/2 samples.<br>
In case more than one subsequent frames can be encoded<br>
using the time-domain encoder 220, the overhead for the<br>
time-domain encoded section stays at N samples. As it is<br>
illustrated in Fiq. 3b where two consecutive frames are<br>
encoded in the time domain and the overlapping regions at<br>
the beginning and the end of the time-domain encoded<br>
sections have the same overlap as it was explained with<br>
respect to Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b shows the overlap structure in<br>
case of two frames encoded with time-domain encoder 220. 3N<br>
samples have to be coded with the time-domain encoder 220<br>
in this case.<br><br>
This overhead can be reduced in embodiments by utilizing<br>
window switching, for example, according to the structure<br>
which is used in AAC. Fig. 3c illustrates a typical<br>
sequence of Long, Start, 8Short and Stop windows, as they<br>
are used in AAC. From Fig. 3c it can be seen that the<br>
window sizes, the data segment sizes and, consequently, the<br>
size of the overlapping regions change with the different<br>
windows. The sequence depicted in Fig. 3c is an example for<br>
the sequence mentioned above.<br>
Embodiments should not be limited to windows of the size of<br>
AAC windows, however, embodiments take advantage of windows<br>
with different overlapping regions and also of windows of<br>
different durations. In embodiments transitions to and from<br>
short windows may utilize a reduced overlap as, for<br>
example, disclosed in Bernd Edler, "Codierung von<br>
Audiosignalen mit iiberlappender Transformation und<br>
adaptiven Fensterfunktionen", Frequenz, Vol. 43, No. 9, p.<br>
252-256, September 1989 and Generic Coding of Moving<br>
Pictures and Associated Audio: Advanced Audio Coding,<br>
International Standard 13818-7, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11<br>
Moving Pictures Expert Group, 1997 may be used in<br>
embodiments to reduce the overhead for the transitions to<br>
and from the time-domain encoded regions, as it is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3d. Fig. 3d illustrates four data<br>
segments, of which the first two and the last one are<br>
encoded in the frequency domain and the third one is<br>
encoded in the time domain. When switching from the<br>
frequency domain to the time domain different windows with<br>
the reduced overlapping size are used, therewith reducing<br>
the overhead.<br>
In embodiments the transition may be based on Start and<br>
Stop windows identical to the ones used in AAC. The<br>
corresponding windows for the transitions to and from the<br>
time-domain encoded regions are windows with only small<br>
regions of overlap. As a consequence, the overhead, i.e.<br>
the number of additional values to be transmitted due to<br><br>
the switching process decreases substantially. Generally,<br>
the overhead may be Novl/2 for each transition with the<br>
window overlap of Novl samples. Thus, a transition with the<br>
regular fully-overlapped window like an AAC with Novl = 1024<br>
incurs an overhead of 1024/2 = 512 samples for the left,<br>
i.e. the fade-in window, and 1024/2 = 512 samples for the<br>
right, i.e. the fade-out window, transition resulting in a<br>
total overhead of 1024 (= N) samples. Choosing a reduced<br>
overlap window like the AAC Short block windows with<br>
Novl=128 only results in an overall overhead of 128 samples.<br>
Embodiments may utilize a filterbank in the frequency-<br>
domain encoder 230 as, for example, the widely used MDCT<br>
filterbank, however, other embodiments may also be used<br>
with frequency-domain codecs based on other cosine-<br>
modulated filterbanks. This may comprise the derivates of<br>
the MDCT, such as extended lapped transforms or low-delay<br>
filterbanks as well as polyphase filterbanks, such as, for<br>
example, the one used in MPEG-l-Layer-1/2/3 audio codecs.<br>
In embodiments efficient implementation of a forward/back-<br>
filterbank operation may take into account a specific type<br>
of window and folding/unfolding used in the filterbank. For<br>
every type of modulated filterbank the analysis stage may<br>
be implemented efficiently by a preprocessing step and a<br>
block transform, i.e. DCT-like or DFT, for the modulation.<br>
In embodiments the corresponding synthesis stage can be<br>
implemented using the corresponding inverse transform and a<br>
post processing step. Embodiments may only use the pre- and<br>
post processing steps for the time-domain encoded signal<br>
portions.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provide the advantage<br>
that a better code efficiency can be achieved, since<br>
switching between a time-domain encoder 220 and the<br>
frequency-domain encoder 230 can be done introducing very<br>
low overhead. In signal sections of subsequent time-domain<br>
encoding only, overlap may be omitted completely in<br><br>
embodiments. Embodiments of the apparatus 100 enable the<br>
according decoding of the encoded data stream.<br>
Embodiments therewith provide the advantage that a lower<br>
coding rate can be achieved for the same quality of, for<br>
example, an audio signal, respectively a higher quality can<br>
be achieved with the same coding rate, as the respective<br>
encoders can be adapted to the transience in the audio<br>
signal.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the<br>
inventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be<br>
performed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disc, DVD or CD having electronically stored control<br>
signals stored thereon, which corporate with the<br>
programmable computer system such that the inventive<br>
methods are performed. Generally, the present invention is,<br>
therefore, a computer program product having a program code<br>
stored on a machine-readable carrier, the program code<br>
being operative for performing the inventive methods when<br>
the computer program product runs on a computer. In other<br>
words, the inventive methods are, therefore, a computer<br>
program having a program code for performing at least one<br>
of the inventive methods when the computer program runs on<br>
a computer.<br><br>
