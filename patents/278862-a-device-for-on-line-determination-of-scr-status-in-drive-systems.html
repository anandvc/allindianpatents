				<td>A DEVICE FOR ON LINE DETERMINATION OF SCR STATUS IN DRIVE<br>
SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention deals with online determination of SCR status in drive<br>
systems. More particularly the present invention deals with line monitoring of SCR<br>
(Silicon Controlled Rectifier) status in thyristorised drives. More particularly, the<br>
presently disclosed device consists of only minimum simple discrete electronics<br>
components.<br>
Background Art:<br>
Faults in a power supply may exist as a phase loss, an under-voltage condition, an<br>
over-voltage condition, or other condition. Such faults may result from a variety of<br>
reasons including breaker trips, fuse loss, inverter faults, shorted turns in a<br>
transformer, and ground faults. Frequency or phase errors also occur when the AC<br>
power frequency falls outside of specified ranges. Power supply faults have<br>
deleterious impact on electrical equipment, and in many applications cannot be<br>
tolerated.<br>
Thyristorised controlled drives are common in todays electrical industrial<br>
applications, Thyristors are gate pulse controlled semi conductor devices. Thynstor<br>
does not conduct when there is no pulse in gate or pulse missing at gate, hence<br>
creates maloperation. To find out the particular missing pulse, all the pulses are to<br>
be checked by oscilloscope making the power circuit off. Oscilloscope Time division,<br>
Volts/ division setting is to be done. Then one by one pulse is checked which is a<br>
time consuming process.<br>
 <br>
Whenever there is a fault in a thyristorised drive, the general fault finding practice is<br>
to switch off main power and to give the auxiliary power for control circuit so that<br>
gate pulses can be released from the controller. Then pulses are observed across<br>
gate and cathode of thyristors with the help of a oscilloscope.<br>
In this process all the pulses are checked one by one. Pulse shape and size are<br>
noted down. If one or more pulses are missing then fault is traced back. This is a<br>
time consuming process. Monitoring of pulses and their comparison takes time.<br>
Objects of invention:<br>
Therefore the present invention is basically targeted to monitor the healthy ness of<br>
the SCRs in on line condition. Hence fault finding during breakdown or failure of<br>
thyristorised controlled systems becomes more easy and less time consuming. The<br>
device is very simple in construction and easy to operate.<br>
The principle object of the present invention is to provide a simple circuit to check<br>
the pulses as well as to know the on line status of SCRs.<br>
Another exemplary object of the present invention is to provide a device, wherein it<br>
is possible to observe all the forward or reverse pulses in circuit at the same time.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide facility of observation to monitor<br>
12 or 24 pulses as per requirement.<br>
Another exemplary object of the present invention to provide the on line status of<br>
thyristors which was not possible prior to this invention. Moreover to check the<br>
pulses in minimum time and to find out which pulse is missing thereby making the<br>
fault finding procedure easy with the involvement of minimum person.<br>
 <br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the on line status of all the<br>
SCRs and condition of gate pulses simultaneously. If any pulse is missing then it is<br>
found out instantly and rectification done immediately. (Fault finding chart helps in<br>
pin pointing the particular fault)<br>
Also the additional objectives of the present invention to reduce the fault finding time<br>
and making the entire fault finding procedure easier with the involvement of<br>
minimum persons.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a circuit which can be<br>
extended to monitor any number of gate pulses individually. Now a days many pulse<br>
Transformers are have LED indication in primary side. If the pulse transformer is not<br>
having primary side LED this can also be incorporated.<br>
These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of<br>
novelty, which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the<br>
claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding<br>
of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its<br>
uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter<br>
in which there are illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above<br>
will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed<br>
description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings<br>
wherein:<br>
 <br>
Fig 1 illustrates the circuit diagram of the device for on line determination of SCR<br>
status in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Fig 2 illustrates the circuit diagram of the device when the input led present in pulse<br>
transformer block in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
This invention is one such effort related to tryristorised drives. AC or DC motors are<br>
heart of any electrical system. In industries mechanical work is done by electrical<br>
control of motors. Speed control of motors by thyristors is a popular technology used<br>
in industries. This invention is related to thyristorised drives of any electrical system.<br>
In present highly competitive market to earn profitability cost reduction is a vital<br>
aspect. Cost of production increases whenever there is a breakdown. The goal of<br>
maintenance people in a production sector is to increase machine availability by<br>
reducing breakdown time. In spite of all preventive maintenance breakdowns occur.<br>
It is the endeavor of the maintenance people to resume production with in minimum<br>
time. This requires quick fault finding technique and rectification procedure. Fault<br>
finding is more difficult and time consuming than rectification activity. Delay due to<br>
electrical problems can be reduced substantially if pin pointing of fault is possible.<br>
The construction is very simple. Number of discrete components used is minimum.<br>
Per thyristor only two i.e. one resistance and one LED. As gate- cathode circuit is<br>
low resistive and sensitive one, most care is taken to reduce any spurious noise by<br>
pulse transformer block or auxiliary circuit. This device also takes care of this point.<br>
Hence G-K terminals are connected with twisted pair cable.<br>
Though the circuit is very simple it's advantages are many. With the use of this<br>
device: -<br>
 <br>
1)	Status of individual SCRs in the drive can be known from the visual<br>
indication of LEDs.<br>
2)	Individual pulse status and their comparison possible.<br>
3)	Fault finding in thyristorised drives becomes easier and less time<br>
consuming.<br>
4)	Men power required for fault finding reduces (one person can do the total<br>
fault finding job).<br>
Normally the pulse Transformer output from G-K goes to gate and cathode of<br>
thyristor respectively. Our device terminal G and K is connected to G-K respectively<br>
as shown in figure 1. Hence our indicating device is connected in parallel to the<br>
existing circuit of G-K terminals of pulse transformer. A parallel circuit always draws<br>
some current from the original circuit. Here utmost attention is given to select the<br>
design resistance so that this circuit does not draw more than 10% of the original<br>
gate current. Generally hard firing is used in industrial applications, which is 200%-<br>
250% of nominal gate current required to turn 'ON' the thyristor. Hence 10% of this<br>
current (maximum) if drawn by this device does not affect normal operation of the<br>
thyristorised drives.<br>
If G-K of thyristor is open the LED glow increases substantially, indicating the failure<br>
of the thyristor. If LED does not glow pulse is missing, either from firing card or from<br>
the pulse transformer. For fault finding refer fault finding charts.<br>
This device consists of a number of channels usually 6 Each individual circuit<br>
consists of a specific series resistance and a LED. The series resistance value is so<br>
selected that the glow of LED is sufficient and this circuit does not draw more than<br>
10% of lg (Gate Current).<br>
This device consists of 6 numbers of individual circuits. The number may increase or<br>
decrease according to requirement. Each individual circuit consists of a series<br>
 <br>
resistance (designed value) and a LED. The series resistance value should be so<br>
selected that the glow of LED is sufficient.<br>
The LED glows when the gate pulse is present as it is connected parallel to the Gate<br>
- Cathode terminals. Hence easily indicates the presence of Pulse.<br>
The device is simple in construction and easy to operate. This device is connected<br>
permanently in circuit, to indicate the gate pulse condition and the healthiness of the<br>
system continuously. In case of any damage of Gate- Cathode junction of SCR, the<br>
LED 2 glow bright LED 1 indicates the healthy condition of the firing circuit up to<br>
primary side of pulse transformer. Hence fault finding becomes easy and less time<br>
consuming. This device can have any number of channels according to requirement.<br>
For every thyristor there should be provision for one channel. For Fault Finding refer<br>
fault finding charts.<br>
Usefulness of the innovation :<br>
(a) Technical / Technological:<br>
-	Indicates the health of SCR in on line condition.<br>
-	Also indicates the availability of firing pulse at secondary of pulse<br>
transformer.<br>
-	Also indicates pulse of insufficient strength (missing pulse) to trigger<br>
the SCR<br>
(b) Economic:<br>
i) Low downtime.<br>
ii) Reduction in Manpower.<br>
fc) Impact in Industry :<br>
Manufactures can incorporate this in their design of pulse controller circuit.<br>
