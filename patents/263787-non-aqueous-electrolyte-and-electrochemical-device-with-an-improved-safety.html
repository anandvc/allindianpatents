NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE AND ELECTROCHEMICAL DEVICE WITH<br>
AN IMPROVED SAFETY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte having improved safety and to an<br>
electrochemical device comprising the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as electronic instruments have become<br>
wireless and portable, non-aqueous electrolyte-based<br>
secondary batteries with high capacity and high energy<br>
density have been practically used as drive sources for<br>
the electronic instruments. A lithium secondary battery,<br>
which is a typical example of the non-aqueous secondary<br>
batteries, comprises a cathode, an anode and an<br>
electrolyte and is chargeable and dischargeable because<br>
lithium ions coming out from a cathode active material<br>
during a charge process are intercalated into an anode<br>
active material and deintercalated during a discharge<br>
process, so that the lithium ions run between both the<br>
electrodes while serving to transfer energy. Such a<br>
high-capacity lithium secondary battery has an advantage<br>
in that it can be used for a long period of time due to<br>
high energy density. However, the lithium secondary<br>
battery has problems in that when the battery is exposed<br>
to high temperatures for a long period of time due to<br>
internal heat generation during the driving thereof, the<br>
stable structure of the battery, comprising a<br>
cathode(ex. lithium transition metal oxide), an anode<br>
(ex. crystalline or non-crystalline carbon) and a<br>
separator, will be changed due to gas generation caused<br>
by the oxidation of the electrolyte to deteriorate the<br>
performance of the battery or, in severe cases, to cause<br>
the ignition and explosion of the battery due to<br><br>
internal short circuits in severe cases.<br>
To solve such problems, there have been many-<br>
recent attempts to improve the high-temperature safety<br>
of the battery by (1) using a porous polyolefin-based<br>
separator having a high melting point, which does not<br>
easily melt in the internal/external thermal<br>
environments or (2) adding a non-flammable organic<br>
solvent to a non-aqueous electrolyte comprising a<br>
lithium salt and a flammable organic solvent.<br>
However, the polyolefin-based separator has a<br>
disadvantage in that it should generally have high film<br>
thickness in order to achieve high-melting point and to<br>
prevent internal short circuits. This high film<br>
thickness relatively reduces the loading amount of the<br>
cathode and the anode, thus making it impossible to<br>
realize a high capacity of the battery, or deteriorating<br>
the performance of the battery in severe cases. Also,<br>
the polyolefin-based separator consists of a polymer<br>
such as PE or PP, which has a melting point of about<br>
150 °C, and thus, when the battery is exposed to high<br>
temperatures above 150 oC for a long period of time, the<br>
separator will melt, causing short circuits inside the<br>
battery, thus causing the ignition and explosion of the<br>
battery.<br>
Meanwhile, a lithium secondary battery comprising<br>
a flammable non-aqueous electrolyte containing a lithium<br>
salt, cyclic carbonate and linear carbonate has the<br>
following problems at high temperatures: (1) a large<br>
amount of heat is generated due to the reaction between<br>
lithium transition metal oxide and the carbonate solvent<br>
to cause the short circuit and ignition of the battery,<br>
and (2) a thermally stable battery cannot be realized<br>
due to the flammability of the non-aqueous electrolyte<br>
itself.<br>
Recently, efforts to solve the problems associated<br><br>
with the flammability of the electrolyte by adding a<br>
phosphorus (P)-based compound having flame retardancy<br>
have been made, but the compound causes a problem of<br>
accelerating irreversible reactions, including Li<br>
corrosion, in a battery, thus significantly reducing the<br>
performance and efficiency of the battery.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found that when both a<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) compound and an aliphatic<br>
di-nitrile compound are used as electrolyte additive,<br>
these compounds show a synergic effect in terms of the<br>
performance of a battery, as well as in terms of the<br>
safety of the battery, for example in terms of the<br>
prevention of battery ignition at over-charged state<br>
and/or the prevention of ignition/explosion caused by<br>
internal short circuit of a battery at high temperatures<br>
above 150 °C. The present invention is based on this<br>
finding.<br>
The present invention provides a non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte comprising a lithium salt and a solvent, the<br>
electrolyte containing, based on the weight of the<br>
electrolyte, 1-10 wt% of a compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product, and 1-10 wt% of an aliphatic di-<br>
nitrile compound, as well as an electrochemical device<br>
comprising the non-aqueous electrolyte:<br>
[Formula 1]<br><br>
wherein X and Y are each independently hydrogen,<br>
chlorine or fluorine, except that both X and Y are not<br>
hydrogen.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides<br>
an electrochemical device comprising: a cathode having a<br><br>
complex formed between a surface of a cathode active<br>
material and an aliphatic di-nitrile compound; and a<br>
non-aqueous electrolyte containing 1-10 wt% of a<br>
compound of Formula 1 or its decomposition product based<br>
on the weight of the electrolyte.<br>
In the present invention, the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound is preferably succinonitrile.<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the<br>
decomposition product of the compound of Formula 1 has<br>
an opened-ring structure.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 are graphic diagrams showing whether<br>
the ignition and explosion of batteries occur after the<br>
batteries are stored in- an oven at 150 °C in a state in<br>
wliich the batteries are charged to 4.2V. Herein, FIG. 1<br>
is for Example 1, FIG. 2 for Comparative Example 1, FIG.<br>
3 for Comparative Example 2.<br>
FIG. 4 is a graphic diagram showing the results of<br>
heat generation analysis conducted using differential<br>
scanning calorimetry (DSC) in order to examine the<br>
thermal safety of each of the batteries manufactured in<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1.<br>
Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in detail.<br>
The present inventors have found through<br>
experiments that the compound of Formula 1 and a nitrile<br>
compound having a cyano (-CN) functional group show a<br>
synergic effect in terms of securing battery safety<br>
associated with thermal shock and in terms of high-<br>
temperature cycle life (see FIGS. 1 to 3) .<br>
When the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product and the aliphatic di-nitrile<br><br>
compound are used in combination as additive, they can<br>
show a synergic effect in terms of the safety of a<br>
battery, and the mechanism thereof is as follows.<br>
The ignition and explosion reactions of a lithium<br>
ion battery can occur due to a rapid exothermic reaction<br>
between a charged cathode and an electrolyte, and if the<br>
capacity of the battery increases, only controlling the<br>
exothermic reaction between the cathode and the<br>
electrolyte cannot secure the safety of the battery.<br>
Generally, when the charge voltage of the cathode<br>
is high or the capacity of the battery is increased (an<br>
increase in the number of stacks (pouch type batteries,<br>
etc.) or the number of electrode windings of jelly-rolls<br>
(cylindrical or prismatic batteries, etc.)), the energy<br>
level of the battery will be increased, and thus the<br>
battery will tend to generate heat due to physical shock<br>
(e.g., heat, temperature, pressure, etc.), or in severe<br>
cases, explode, thus reducing the safety of the battery.<br>
The compound of Formula 1 such as a fluoroethylene<br>
carbonate can prevent or delay the battery from being<br>
ignited by the exothermic reaction, compared to ethylene<br>
carbonate. This is because the compound of Formula 1<br>
consists of a halogen-based compound (e.g., one<br>
introduced with at least one of fluorine (F) and<br>
chlorine (CI) ) having a high flame-retardant effect, and<br>
in particular, the compound can form an SEI layer<br>
(protective layer) on the anode surface upon charge to<br>
delay micro- or 'macro-thermal short circuits occurring<br>
inside the battery.<br>
However, the compound of Formula 1 such as a<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate is so thermally fragile to be<br>
easily decomposed at high temperature and to generate a<br>
large amount of gas. The generated gas can vent a pouch-<br>
typed or can-typed battery case, thereby accelerating<br>
the combustion of the electrolyte and causing the<br><br>
ignition and explosion of the battery due to internal<br>
short circuits<br>
That is, when the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product is used alone, the safety of the<br>
battery, particularly the high-temperature safety of the<br>
battery, cannot be sufficiently secured (see FIG. 2).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is characterized in<br>
that the aliphatic di-nitrile compound is used in<br>
combination with the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product.<br>
When the aliphatic di-nitrile compound is used in<br>
combination with the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product, the aliphatic di-nitrile compound<br>
can form a complex on the surface of a cathode<br>
consisting of lithium-transition metal oxide so as to<br>
inhibit the reaction between the electrolyte (ex. linear<br>
carbonates or cyclic carbonates) and the cathode, thus<br>
controlling heat generation and controlling an increase<br>
in the temperature of the battery. Also, the complex<br>
formation can prevent the combustion of the electrolyte,<br>
which is accelerated by oxygen liberated due to the<br>
structural collapse of the cathode, prevent thermal<br>
runaway phenomena, and prevent the internal short<br>
circuit of the battery from occurring due to heat<br>
generation (see FIG. 4).<br>
Also, the continuous interaction chemically<br>
between the compound of Formula 1 and the cyano (-CN)<br>
functional group of the nitrile compound prevents a<br>
large amount of gas generation occurred when using the<br>
compound of Formula 1 alone.<br>
In short, 1) the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product and 2) an aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound such as succinonitrile can show a synergic<br>
effect, thus improving the safety of the battery.<br>
Furthermore, when the compound of Formula 1 or its<br><br>
decomposition product and the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound are used in combination, they can show a<br>
synergic effect in terms of the performance of a<br>
battery, and the mechanism thereof is as follows.<br>
The compound of Formula 1 or its decomposition<br>
product forms a dense and close passivation layer on the<br>
anode upon the initial charge cycle (which is generally<br>
referred as formation of a battery). The passivation<br>
layer prevents co-intercalation of the carbonate solvent<br>
into the layered structure of active materials and<br>
decomposition of the carbonate solvent, and thus reduces<br>
irreversible reactions in the battery. Additionally, the<br>
passivation layer allows only Li+ to be<br>
intercalated/deintercalated through the layer, thereby<br>
improving the life characteristics of the battery.<br>
However, the passivation layer {SEI layer) formed<br>
by the compound is easily decomposed at high temperature<br>
(above 60 *C) to generate a large amount of gas (CO2 and<br>
CO) , and particularly in the case of a cylindrical<br>
battery, the generated gas breaks a current interruptive<br>
device (CID), an electrochemical device at a cylindrical<br>
cap region, to interrupt electric current, thus reducing<br>
the function of the battery. In severe cases, the<br>
generated gas opens the cap region, so that the<br>
electrolyte leaks to corrode the appearance of the<br>
battery or to cause a significant reduction in the<br>
performance of the battery.<br>
According to the present invention, gas generation<br>
resulting from the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product can be inhibited through the use<br>
of the aliphatic di-nitrile compound by the chemical<br>
interaction between the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition and a cyano (-CN) functional group, thus<br>
improving the high-temperature cycle life<br>
characteristics of the battery(see Table 2).<br><br>
When considering this effect together with an<br>
improvement in the performance of a high-capacity<br>
battery, succinonitrile is most suitable as aliphatic<br>
di-nitrile.<br>
Among aliphatic di-nitrile compounds, those having<br>
long chain length have no great effect on the<br>
performance and safety of the battery or adversely<br>
affect the performance of the battery, and thus those<br>
having short chain length are preferable. However,<br>
malononitrile (CN-CH2-CN) having an excessively short<br>
chain length causes side reactions such as gas<br>
generation in the battery, and thus it is preferable to<br>
use those having 2-12 aliphatic hydrocarbons (CN-(CH2)n_<br>
CN, n=2-12), including succinonitrile. Among them, it is<br>
more preferable to select nitrile having small carbon<br>
number. Most preferred is succinonitrile.<br>
Meanwhile, among compounds containing a' cyano<br>
functional group, aromatic nitriles and fluorinated<br>
aromatic nitrile compounds are not preferable because<br>
they are electrochemically easily decomposed in the<br>
battery to interfere with the migration of Li ions, thus<br>
deteriorating the performance of the battery.<br>
The content of the compound of Formula 1 or its<br>
decomposition product for use in the inventive<br>
electrolyte is preferably 1-10 wt%, and more preferably<br>
1-5 wt%. The compound of Formula 1 has a high viscosity,<br>
and thus when the compound of Formula 1 is used in an<br>
excessive amount, the ion conductivity of the<br>
electrolyte can be reduced and the mobility of Li ion<br>
can be inhibited, causing to a reduction of the cycle<br>
life and capacity of battery.<br>
The content of the aliphatic di-nitrile compound<br>
is preferably 1-10 wt%, more preferably 1-5 wt%, and<br>
most preferably 1-3 wt%, in view of the performance of<br>
the electrolyte.<br><br>
The inventive electrolyte may contain as an<br>
additive an aliphatic mono-nitrile compound having one<br>
cyano (-CN) functional group such as R-CN, wherein R is<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon etc.).<br>
The inventive non-aqueous electrolyte for lithium<br>
secondary batteries contain a general non-aqueous<br>
organic solvents, including cyclic carbonates, linear<br>
carbonates and combinations thereof. Typical examples of<br>
the cyclic carbonates include ethylene carbonate (EC) ,<br>
propylene carbonate (PC), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and<br>
the like, and typical examples of the linear carbonates<br>
include diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate<br>
(DMC), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) and the like.<br>
The non-aqueous electrolyte contains a lithium<br>
salt, non-limiting examples of which include LiCIOa,<br>
LiCF3S03, LiPF6, LiBF4, LiAsF6, LiSbF6, LiN (CF3S02) 2,<br>
LiN(C2F5S02)2, L1AIO4, LiAlCl4, LiS03CF3, and<br>
LiN (CxF2x+iS02) (CyF2y+iS02) (x and y = natural numbers).<br>
Meanwhile, the aliphatic di-nitrile compounds can<br>
form a bond with a transition metal, such as cobalt,<br>
contained in the cathode active material through their<br>
cyano functional groups having high dipole moment.<br>
Particularly, the cyano functional groups can form<br>
stronger bonds with the surface of the cathode at high<br>
temperature, thereby forming a complex structure.<br>
In order to simplify a manufacturing process of a<br>
battery, it is preferable that the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound is introduced into an electrolyte, and then a<br>
complex is formed between the surface of a cathode<br>
active material and the aliphatic di-nitrile compound.<br>
However, it is also possible to separately prepare a<br>
cathode having a complex formed on the surface thereof,<br>
before the assemblage of a battery.<br>
Preferably, the complex between the surface of a<br>
cathode active material and the aliphatic di-nitrile<br><br>
compound is formed by dipping a cathode, comprising a<br>
cathode active material coated on a collector, into an<br>
electrolyte containing the aliphatic di-nitrile compound<br>
added thereto, followed by heat treatment at high<br>
temperature. The high-temperature heat treatment may be<br>
performed in such a temperature range as not to affect<br>
electrode active materials and a binder, generally at a<br>
temperature of 18 0 °C or lower. Otherwise, although the<br>
high-temperature heat treatment depends on the kind of<br>
the aliphatic di-nitrile compound, it may be performed<br>
at such a temperature range as to prevent excessive<br>
evaporation of the aliphatic di-nitrile compound,<br>
generally at a temperature of 100 °C or lower. In<br>
general, the high-temperature treatment is suitably<br>
performed at a temperature between 60 °C and 90 °C. Long-<br>
term treatment at a temperature between 30 °C and 4 0 °C<br>
may provide the same effect.<br>
In addition, in the present invention, a compound<br>
capable of forming a passivation layer on the surface of<br>
an anode may additionally be used to prevent side<br>
reactions where a passivation layer formed on the anode<br>
from the compound of Formula 1, such as fluoroethylene<br>
carbonate, emits a large amount of gas at high<br>
temperature. Non-limiting examples of the compound<br>
include alkylene compounds, such as vinylene carbonate<br>
(VC), sulfur-containing compounds, such as propane<br>
sulfone, ethylene sulfite and 1,3-propane sultone, and<br>
lactam-based compounds, such as N-acetyl lactam.<br>
Furthermore, the electrolyte according to the<br>
present invention may comprise vinylene carbonate,<br>
propane sulfone and ethylene sulfite at the same time,<br>
but only a sulfur-containing compound may also be<br>
selectively added to the electrolyte to improve the<br>
high-temperature cycle life characteristics of the<br>
battery.<br><br>
A typical example of electrochemical devices,<br>
which can be manufactured according to the present<br>
invention, is a lithium secondary battery, which may<br>
comprise: (1) a cathode capable of intercalating and<br>
deintercalating lithium ions; (2) an anode capable of<br>
intercalating and deintercalating lithium ions; (3) a<br>
porous separator; and (4) a) a lithium salt, and b) an<br>
electrolyte solvent.<br>
In general, as a cathode active material for use<br>
in a lithium secondary battery, lithium-containing<br>
transition metal oxides may be used. The cathode active<br>
material can be at least one material selected from the<br>
group consisting of LiCo02, LiNi02, LiMn204, LiMn02, and<br>
LiNii-xCoxMy02 (wherein 0:2 X 
metal such as Mg, Al, Sr or La) . Meanwhile, as an anode<br>
active material for use a lithium secondary battery,<br>
carbon, lithium metal or lithium alloy may be used. In<br>
addition, other metal oxides capable of lithium<br>
intercalation/deintercalation and having an electric<br>
potential of less than 2V based on lithium (for example,<br>
Ti02 and Sn02) may be used as the anode active material.<br>
The lithium secondary battery according to the<br>
present invention may have a cylindrical, prismatic or<br>
pouch-like shape.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
described in further detail with reference to examples.<br>
It is to be understood, however, that these examples are<br>
illustrative only and the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto.<br>

observed. The observation results are shown in FIGS. 1<br>
to 3.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 1, only the case of the<br>
battery containing 1 wt% of fluoroethylene carbonate<br>
(FEC) and 2 wt% of the succinonitrile compound (SN)<br>
added to the electrolyte solvent realized a thermally<br>
stable battery at high temperature for 1 hour or longer<br>
without ignition.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of adding<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate alone (FIG. 2) or the case of<br>
"lidding oh'ly succinonitrile (FIG. 3), it could be seen<br>
that the battery was ignited and exploded at a high<br>
temperature above 150 °C without mTiTrifaTnirfg high-<br>
temperature safety for 1 hour. However, the battery<br>
comprising the electrolyte containing only<br>
succinonitrile added thereto had an advantage in that<br>
the time for the battery to explode was long because the<br>
battery was superior to the battery comprising the<br>
electrolyte containing fluoroethylene carbonate alone<br>
with respect to controlling heat generation resulting<br>
from the reaction between the cathode and the<br>
electrolyte and the structural collapse of the cathode.<br>
2.	Test for Safety (2)<br><br>
Each of the batteries manufactured in Example 1<br>
and Comparative Example 4 was charged to 4.2V. A general<br>
thermogravimetric analyzer, DSC (Differential Scanning<br>
Calorimeter), was used, wherein two high-pressure pans<br>
capable of resisting the vapor pressure of the<br>
electrolyte were used as pans for measurement. To one<br>
pan, about 5-10 mg of the cathode sample separated from<br>
each of the batteries charged to 4.2V was introduced,<br>
while the other pan was left empty. The calorific<br>
difference between the two pans was analyzed while the<br>
pans were heated at a rate of 5 "C/min to 400 'Cto<br>
measure temperature peaks corresponding to heat<br>
generation.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the battery (Comparative<br>
Example 4) manufactured without the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound shows heat generation peaks at about 200 °C and<br>
about 240 °C. Generally, the peak at about 200 °C<br>
indicates heat generation caused by the reaction between<br>
the electrolyte and the cathode, while the peak at about<br>
240 13 indicates heat generation caused by combined<br>
factors including the reaction between the electrolyte<br>
and the cathode, and the structural collapse of the<br>
cathode. The battery comprising the non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte containing succinonitrile added thereto<br>
showed a remarkable reduction in heat generation without<br>
showing the above two temperature peaks. This indicates<br>
that heat generation caused by the reaction between the<br>
electrolyte and the cathode was controlled due to the<br>
formation of a protective layer through a strong bond<br>
between succinonitrile and the cathode surface.<br>
3. Test for Safety (3)<br>
Each battery obtained from Examples 1 and 2, and<br>
Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 was tested under<br>
the overcharge conditions of 12V/1C and 20V/1C in a<br>
CC/CV (Constant Current/Constant Voltage) manner. The<br><br>
above overcharge test was repeated many times and the<br>
average values for the test results are shown in the<br>
Table 1.<br>
As shown in Table 1, only the case of the battery<br>
containing fluoroethylene carbonate and succinonitrile<br>
compound added to the electrolyte solvent showed a<br>
excellent safety without ignition nor internal short<br>
circuits, by controlling the oxidation of the<br>
electrolyte and the exothermic reaction resulting from<br>
the structural collapse of the cathode.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of adding<br>
fluoroethylene carbonate alone such as Comparative<br>
Example 1 and 3 or the case of adding only aliphatic<br>
mono-nitrile compound or the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound such as Comparative Example 2 and 6, it could<br>
be seen that the frequency of the battery ignition at<br>
over-charged state is not constant and is largely high.<br>
For example, batteries were ignited while a high<br>
temperature above 200 °C was detected inside the battery/<br>
at surface of the battery.<br>
Meanwhile, the case of adding neither aliphatic<br>
mono-nitrile compound nor the aliphatic di-nitrile<br>
compound(Comparative Example 4), all the batteries were<br>
ignited.<br><br>
4. Test for battery performance<br><br>
Each battery obtained from Example 3 and<br>
Comparative Examples 4 and 5 was stored at a high<br>
temperature of 80°C for 10 days and tested for battery<br>
performance. The test results are shown in the following<br>
table 2. Exmaple 3 comprising the non-aqueous<br>
electrolyte containing fluoroethylene carbonate and<br>
succinonitrile added thereto according to the present<br>
invention, showed excellent capacity restorability and<br>
battery performance even after a high-temperature<br>
storage.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, according to<br>
the present invention, when the compound of Formula 1<br>
and the aliphatic di-nitrile compound are used in<br>
combination, they can show a synergic effect in terms of<br>
securing safety at over-charged condition or in case of<br>
a high-temperature storage, and also can provide<br>
excellent battery performance.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention has been described for illustrative purposes,<br>
